1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,140
Speaker 1: It's Monday, February 10th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,582
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:12,890
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,630
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, technology in sports.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,928
Speaker 1: Sports technology.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,528
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,570
Speaker 1: I've been just skiing a lot this winter.

8
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,790
Speaker 1: And finally, I have someone else to ski with.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,430
Speaker 1: Emily's been skiing with me and she's gotten to the point to where she can go on the big mountain.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,330
Speaker 1: She has progressed from beginner skier to competent skier.

11
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:38,407
Speaker 0: Alright, next step.

12
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:39,790
Speaker 0: Graveyard.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,809
Speaker 1: I think it means she can go in the-- Perhaps hospital.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,950
Speaker 1: So last time we went skiing, actually, she took-- I got her a private lesson.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:56,670
Speaker 1: And I gotta say, in terms of learning a nuanced physical skill, nothing really beats a private lesson with someone who's an expert at teaching that thing.

16
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:01,390
Speaker 0: It's so weird, 'cause when I was a kid, I had plenty of lessons in all kinds of things.

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,390
Speaker 1: Probably from people who weren't actually professionals at it.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,509
Speaker 1: There were people who were way better than I was, but the thing is-- Professional instructor.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,270
Speaker 0: The point is, as a kid, it's just like, it didn't matter what the instructor was.

20
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:17,770
Speaker 0: I didn't fucking pay attention and follow instructions properly.

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,270
Speaker 0: But now that I'm an adult, it's like, I feel like, aha, if someone tells me what to do, I can do exactly what they tell me to do.

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:31,049
Speaker 1: See, maybe you were just dumb, 'cause when I was a kid and I got, like, swimming lessons, like, I paid a lot of attention to what the instructor was saying and I tried to do it.

23
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:36,321
Speaker 0: I think I got bored with things like swimming lessons because it's like, I already sort of knew how to swim and they were like,

24
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:36,970
Speaker 0: "Kick.".

25
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,587
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Yeah, I've been kicking in a pool for like ten

26
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:39,909
Speaker 0: years.".

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,370
Speaker 1: Well, obviously you weren't kicking right if they were telling you to kick.

28
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:43,603
Speaker 0: All they said was,

29
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:43,928
Speaker 0: "Kick.".

30
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,888
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Yeah, look at

31
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:44,970
Speaker 0: me.".

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,580
Speaker 1: See, I think there's a very simple issue here.

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,349
Speaker 1: There's a fundamental issue.

34
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:59,029
Speaker 1: If you're a kid and you clearly know more or feel like you know more than an instructor, you won't listen to anything they say and you won't respect them.

35
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:10,990
Speaker 1: And I think this is complemented by the fact that most people who are paid money to teach kids things outside of a school and oftentimes into school, not actually good at teaching that thing and often not that good at that thing.

36
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,770
Speaker 0: I think another aspect is that when you're a kid, you're not paying that person.

37
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,910
Speaker 0: As an adult, if I get a lesson, I'm paying that person for the lesson.

38
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,530
Speaker 1: I was paying, yeah, college.

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,230
Speaker 1: I was paying that professor to teach the class that I skipped.

40
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,670
Speaker 1: I was paying a lot of money for that.

41
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:31,349
Speaker 1: I would think about how much money that credit hour cost when I walked out of that class.

42
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,530
Speaker 1: The money is not the factor.

43
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:40,630
Speaker 0: I mean, if you pay for a specific thing, as opposed to just college, right?

44
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,686
Speaker 0: If you had paid for one class, I want to learn this thing.

45
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,277
Speaker 1: But I could break down.

46
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:47,090
Speaker 1: I was paying for that one class.

47
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,850
Speaker 1: I could have taken a different class.

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,352
Speaker 1: In fact, I was paying the same no matter how many credit hours I took over 12.

49
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:57,126
Speaker 1: So if I didn't take that extra four credit hours, I was just pissing away money.

50
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:14,130
Speaker 1: But yeah, instructors, what I've also noticed is that the group lessons for things like this, if you go to a place where you're going to learn a skill, like a ski lodge is a great example, because they have usually group lessons, where you go to a group based on your ability and then they teach.

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:23,710
Speaker 1: Other than at the top levels, the lessons are almost garbage, usually, because the other people are just really extra bad or extra not paying attention.

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,629
Speaker 0: It's the same feeling you get when you have to play a board game and someone playing the board game is really dumb or slow or doesn't understand the rules.

53
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,290
Speaker 0: It's the same idea when you're in a group lesson and the other people are holding back the whole group.

54
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the moral is get private lessons and get private board game time with people like us.

55
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,070
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do that at a con.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,509
Speaker 0: No, because you're the dumb person who's going to fuck it up.

57
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,730
Speaker 1: Scott, at a con, let's charge people to play games with us.

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,263
Speaker 0: So we sit at a table and we say, "If you want to play with us,

59
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:52,706
Speaker 0: bye-bye.".

60
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:54,929
Speaker 1: Here's a list of games we know.

61
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,005
Speaker 1: We will play good, fast, skilled games for $80 an hour.

62
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,073
Speaker 0: Okay.

63
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:03,368
Speaker 0: What if the person who plays sucks?

64
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,370
Speaker 1: Then it's going to take four fucking hours.

65
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,344
Speaker 0: That's going to reduce our income.

66
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, this would only work if we... It'd basically be our equivalent of wasting our day at Artist Alley.

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,869
Speaker 0: We need to get more games in for more money.

68
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

69
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:16,659
Speaker 1: It depends.

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,189
Speaker 1: Do you want to make money or do you want to have fun?

71
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,949
Speaker 1: Seems like a lot of people who are Artist Allying it up tend to want to make money rather than have fun.

72
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,381
Speaker 1: Anyway, I digress.

73
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,430
Speaker 1: That was my opening bit.

74
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:28,690
Speaker 1: Now we can move on to the news bit.

75
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,530
Speaker 0: Just the tiny news because there isn't really much news going on.

76
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,774
Speaker 1: It's fine.

77
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:32,489
Speaker 1: I got a shit ton of news.

78
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,071
Speaker 0: All right.

79
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:43,389
Speaker 0: So apparently, if you look at the biggest websites in the world, not in terms of the number of users or the number of visitors or the number of web visits or any shit like that.

80
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:52,436
Speaker 0: If you look in terms of which company is using the most internet bandwidth, number one, at least in the United States, I don't know if it's U.S.

81
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:56,151
Speaker 0: or World, but Netflix, 32%.

82
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:57,369
Speaker 1: I would easily believe that.

83
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:57,913
Speaker 0: Google, 22%.

84
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:00,930
Speaker 0: Apple, 4.3.

85
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,790
Speaker 0: And I guess that's including like all the stuff iPhones are doing, right?

86
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,030
Speaker 0: Because they always have to talk to Apple.

87
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,668
Speaker 0: They can't talk directly to who they're talking to.

88
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:15,770
Speaker 0: Number four, above Facebook, above Hulu, above Valve, above Amazon, above Pandora and Tumblr, right?

89
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,942
Speaker 0: In terms of how much percentage of U.S.

90
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:24,150
Speaker 0: peak internet traffic produced by companies networks, number four is Twitch.

91
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,946
Speaker 1: Not bad.

92
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,110
Speaker 0: There is that much game streaming now going on.

93
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,630
Speaker 1: There is a big culture of share what you're doing with the three people who care.

94
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:38,969
Speaker 0: I think it was pushed on by the fact the Xbone and the PS4 can just stream to Twitch, right?

95
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:42,685
Speaker 0: That helped it out a lot, but it's awesome.

96
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:43,790
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

97
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,550
Speaker 1: It's awesome, but at the same time, I find watching these things to be usually awful.

98
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:54,450
Speaker 0: That's why you got to find the good ones, like Fast Karate Channel.

99
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:58,490
Speaker 1: Or perhaps Rim and Scott playing Nidhogg, even though apparently that disappeared.

100
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,250
Speaker 1: Thanks, Twitch.

101
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

102
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:08,630
Speaker 0: Twitch is supposed to... They said we're not automatically archiving your things anymore, but go to your settings and turn this thing on so they auto-archive.

103
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,330
Speaker 0: And I did that, and I guess I just discovered right now they're not auto-archiving?

104
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, so sorry guys, you don't get to watch the awesome Nidhogg stream we did.

105
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,068
Speaker 0: Where I won a whole bunch.

106
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,484
Speaker 0: So, Rim couldn't even defeat me even once.

107
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:25,230
Speaker 0: His swords just got dodged and blocked.

108
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, you're so good that we should play live at a convention and show everyone how good you are.

109
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:39,790
Speaker 0: Screw you, Twitch, for lying.

110
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:41,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what's up.

111
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:41,688
Speaker 1: We'll figure it out.

112
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,802
Speaker 1: So, actually, another meta bit.

113
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,190
Speaker 1: It arrived today.

114
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,550
Speaker 1: I got my titanium lens frames to put my prescription lenses in for Google Glass.

115
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,547
Speaker 0: But there's no lenses in them?

116
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta go to an optician to get lenses in.

117
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,490
Speaker 1: They come with lenses that don't do anything.

118
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:58,950
Speaker 0: Oh, I could wear those.

119
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,690
Speaker 1: You could, if you want to have the aesthetic of wearing glasses.

120
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,370
Speaker 1: All the pain in the ass of glasses with none of the benefits, then that's your option.

121
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:18,750
Speaker 1: So, in the news, it was leaked that the New York Police Department is evaluating using Google Glass for its investigative and/or patrol officers.

122
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,488
Speaker 0: How is that gonna help?

123
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,937
Speaker 1: I think it'd help pretty well.

124
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,630
Speaker 1: One, it doesn't replace.

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,330
Speaker 1: The thing is, everyone expects this to be used to video everything the cops do.

126
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:27,806
Speaker 1: No.

127
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,030
Speaker 1: Glass is terrible at that.

128
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:29,593
Speaker 1: Stop.

129
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:31,285
Speaker 0: Everyone thinks Glass can do that.

130
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:32,050
Speaker 0: They're all morons.

131
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:35,750
Speaker 1: Well, it could if you hack it together with a fucking battery plugged into it.

132
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
Speaker 0: It doesn't have enough storage.

133
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,049
Speaker 1: It has enough storage for an entire day.

134
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:39,652
Speaker 0: No.

135
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,030
Speaker 1: It compresses the video to shit.

136
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:43,090
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

137
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:43,866
Speaker 0: I have investigated.

138
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,050
Speaker 0: You got all the other shit on your glass, too, filling up storage space.

139
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,550
Speaker 1: The only thing taking up any space is pictures.

140
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,903
Speaker 1: That's 99% of the space.

141
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:53,990
Speaker 1: Pictures and videos.

142
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,070
Speaker 1: Anyway, there is already technology that exists to be a dashcam for a cop.

143
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,769
Speaker 1: That's not what Glass would be good for.

144
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a separate technology, anyway.

145
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,709
Speaker 1: But, basically, all they're doing, they're not saying they're gonna use it.

146
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:13,910
Speaker 1: What they're doing is they're saying, "We're gonna look at it to see if anything it does now could be useful for law enforcement.

147
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,539
Speaker 1: And simultaneously, we're gonna see if there's anything we could come up with after officers use it and see what it's like.

148
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,269
Speaker 1: if we could write software that would be

149
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:23,630
Speaker 1: useful.".

150
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,910
Speaker 1: So they're doing exactly what everyone should do when there's technology like this.

151
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,850
Speaker 1: Evaluate it to see if there's use cases that are worth pursuing.

152
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,735
Speaker 0: Why is that in news?

153
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,690
Speaker 0: Someone is evaluating a technology.

154
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,847
Speaker 1: Well, partly because it was leaked.

155
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,450
Speaker 0: It was a secret that they were evaluating a technology.

156
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,489
Speaker 1: And partly because a lot of people seem to be really mad about it.

157
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,089
Speaker 1: They're like, "Now the cops are gonna have video of what I

158
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:45,190
Speaker 1: do.".

159
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:47,770
Speaker 1: Yes, I want the cops to have video of everything they do.

160
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,009
Speaker 1: That way, when they beat someone up, there's video of it.

161
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,634
Speaker 1: Cops.

162
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:51,767
Speaker 1: Bad boys, bad boys.

163
00:08:52,291 --> 00:09:01,085
Speaker 1: Or the cops might look me up and investigate and be like, "Yeah, if I'm getting arrested, I'd like them to be able to easily, on the fly, figure out if I'm armed and dangerous or

164
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:01,308
Speaker 1: not.".

165
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,809
Speaker 0: Glass cops, glass cops.

166
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,570
Speaker 1: I could come up with a lot of really good things that you could do if you wrote good software for cops to use with glass.

167
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,170
Speaker 1: I don't think that good software will ever be written.

168
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,149
Speaker 0: If there's an emergency, immediately they see an alert on the glass and the map shows up telling them where to go.

169
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,947
Speaker 0: So imagine this.

170
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,906
Speaker 0: Shows them a picture of the suspect and then...

171
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, or imagine this.

172
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,170
Speaker 1: Let's say you are driving to the scene.

173
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,450
Speaker 0: A cop's driving around town, a convenience store alarm goes off.

174
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:37,290
Speaker 0: Immediately, he sees, you know, convenience store robbery, in progress, address, map, and then he sees the live footage from the cameras.

175
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:38,330
Speaker 0: From the helicopter.

176
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,210
Speaker 0: From the helicopter or the cameras in the convenience store.

177
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,008
Speaker 1: But think about that.

178
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:49,730
Speaker 1: If you had Glass on showing you the live feed from the IR helicopter while you're walking through the woods chasing a guy, that's some Ghost in the Shell shit right there.

179
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:50,150
Speaker 1: That's right.

180
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,709
Speaker 1: Or imagine, here's my dream app.

181
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:53,230
Speaker 1: I'll share my dream app with you.

182
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,270
Speaker 1: I've been thinking a lot about how to make Glass useful.

183
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,530
Speaker 1: Imagine if a cop could be like, "Okay, Glass.

184
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,444
Speaker 1: What are the laws about possession,

185
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,369
Speaker 1: marijuana?".

186
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:07,730
Speaker 1: And then it just shows the current law right there while he's like, handcuffing the person.

187
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,007
Speaker 0: The cop is like, "Google, is it legal to take pictures of the

188
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:12,369
Speaker 0: subway?".

189
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:13,101
Speaker 0: "No.".

190
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:14,342
Speaker 0: Just like, "Well,

191
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:14,626
Speaker 0: fuck.".

192
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,209
Speaker 1: Of course, then he'll just get no connection to Google Cloud.

193
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:18,641
Speaker 0: "Oh, I'm in a train.

194
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:18,904
Speaker 0: That's a

195
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:19,248
Speaker 0: problem.".

196
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,710
Speaker 1: But the biggest one is if they finally do the facial recognition.

197
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,710
Speaker 1: Imagine if you're arresting someone, right?

198
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,690
Speaker 1: Or you're talking to someone.

199
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,809
Speaker 1: You pull someone over, you detain a suspicious individual.

200
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,130
Speaker 0: Three warrants, crazy drug dealer, crazy murderer.

201
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,310
Speaker 1: It's the Schmod's computer.

202
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,123
Speaker 0: "Watch out for this

203
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:36,529
Speaker 0: dude."

204
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:37,470
Speaker 0: From the Blues Brothers.

205
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:43,864
Speaker 0: Even if you approach someone who's not illegal or anything like, "Oh, there's a guy walking around town with a

206
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:44,147
Speaker 0: gun.".

207
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,590
Speaker 0: Just walk past him and it says, "Joe Blow has..." Outstanding warrants.

208
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,433
Speaker 0: "Has permit.

209
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:51,519
Speaker 0: Is totally cool.

210
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,304
Speaker 0: Ignore this guy.

211
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:53,008
Speaker 0: Don't even bother

212
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:53,149
Speaker 0: him.".

213
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,079
Speaker 0: Just say, "Hey, Joe.

214
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,565
Speaker 0: What's going

215
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:54,787
Speaker 0: on?"

216
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:55,837
Speaker 0: And keep going.

217
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,290
Speaker 0: Don't even have to stop him and question him.

218
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,619
Speaker 0: Because he's a crazy libertarian.

219
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,590
Speaker 0: He's legally right and you're just going to make a fight with him, so just don't do anything.

220
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:09,550
Speaker 1: You could do really cool stuff with this technology, but guys, I bring this up because everyone's making this mistake.

221
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,987
Speaker 1: Focus on the screen, not the fucking camera.

222
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:12,249
Speaker 1: Jesus.

223
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:19,650
Speaker 1: If you're going to talk about future sci-fi awesome stuff, at least focus on actual cool awesome sci-fi future stuff.

224
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,870
Speaker 1: Wearing a camera that always records everything has been possible for a decade.

225
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:28,170
Speaker 1: Nothing new is happening there, at least in regards to Google Glass.

226
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,950
Speaker 0: We've said this about a hundred times.

227
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,198
Speaker 1: Also, I think this is cool.

228
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:32,650
Speaker 1: I want to see if they actually come up with something.

229
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,649
Speaker 0: How about all the things I just said?

230
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:46,330
Speaker 1: I am 100% convinced that they will not come up with anything interesting and that if they do, they will spend a ton of money to develop software that doesn't work and then it'll be called a failure years later.

231
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,210
Speaker 1: Because that's how government contracts work with that stuff.

232
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,030
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

233
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,408
Speaker 1: A co-worker pointed this out to me.

234
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,029
Speaker 1: Are you familiar with Yeshivish?

235
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,159
Speaker 0: I know what a Yeshiva is.

236
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:04,990
Speaker 0: It's a school where the Orthodox Jew kids go.

237
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:14,870
Speaker 1: Yeshivish is a sort of dialect, or according to Wikipedia, a sociolect of Yiddish and English that's spoken basically in the Yeshivas.

238
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,450
Speaker 0: So it's how Yeshiva kids talk to each other in school.

239
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,453
Speaker 0: Basically, yeah.

240
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:26,421
Speaker 1: The Yeshiva kids and their dads in the more farther Orthodox communities will speak in this sort of dialect.

241
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,110
Speaker 1: that's kind of like Franglais.

242
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,809
Speaker 1: It's halfway between Yiddish and English.

243
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:32,079
Speaker 1: And it's an interesting dialect.

244
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:34,070
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of cool stuff you can learn about sociolects.

245
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,949
Speaker 1: I mean, me and Scott and the Front Row Crew effectively have a sociolect around caveman talk and doujing and things.

246
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,090
Speaker 1: So there's a whole sea of Wikipedia that I'm going to point you in the direction of.

247
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,050
Speaker 1: that you might find fascinating.

248
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,550
Speaker 1: But this here is a pretty famous document in Yeshivish.

249
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,889
Speaker 1: It's the Gettysburg Address translated into Yeshivish.

250
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,390
Speaker 1: And it's delightful to read.

251
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,727
Speaker 1: I almost want to read it because it's funny and cool.

252
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:06,850
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I do not pronounce Yiddish words well at all.

253
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,950
Speaker 1: But it's just, let's see.

254
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,049
Speaker 1: The Gettysburg Address.

255
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,147
Speaker 1: "Barek, a yoival, and a half ago, the mishadim sheld vekthis makam anaya malkas with the

256
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:16,649
Speaker 1: kapana.".

257
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:18,010
Speaker 0: That's so bad.

258
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:18,630
Speaker 1: How do you want it?

259
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,469
Speaker 0: Can you at least try?

260
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:20,390
Speaker 1: I am trying.

261
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,029
Speaker 0: No, you're not.

262
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,669
Speaker 1: I have a genetic undisposition toward this.

263
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,529
Speaker 1: There's a funny part at the end.

264
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:35,129
Speaker 1: That Hashim should give the Gansi oilim anaya brana cheris that the nation that shams buy the oilim, buy the oilim, buy the oilim will blodfest ad oilim.

265
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,688
Speaker 1: Because Yiddish is kind of Germanic.

266
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:43,188
Speaker 1: So, of the people, by the people, for the people basically becomes buy the oilim, buy the oilim, buy the oilim.

267
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:45,889
Speaker 1: This is funny and you should read it.

268
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,408
Speaker 1: And then learn all about this cool stuff.

269
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,410
Speaker 0: So we're talking about sports technologies.

270
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,090
Speaker 1: Also, Captain, I should send you this and we'll record you reading it.

271
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,050
Speaker 0: Alright, that'll sound right.

272
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:55,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe it will.

273
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,530
Speaker 0: Speaking of sports technologies, this guy bought a 3D printer.

274
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,129
Speaker 0: Or at least he bought 3D printer parts.

275
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:04,250
Speaker 0: But he didn't make a 3D printer.

276
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,210
Speaker 1: He made an air hockey robot.

277
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,130
Speaker 0: Can't beat it at air hockey.

278
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:09,309
Speaker 0: So good.

279
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,170
Speaker 0: Sports technology.

280
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:10,969
Speaker 0: Air hockey's the best.

281
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,750
Speaker 0: I'm a guy at air hockey.

282
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is pretty great.

283
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:13,498
Speaker 0: The end.

284
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:22,250
Speaker 1: I don't think a human could beat this, but at the same time, he was not attempting to get much velocity out of that puck there.

285
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:22,685
Speaker 1: I don't know.

286
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,170
Speaker 0: It moves pretty fast.

287
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,870
Speaker 1: One, he was not using a tournament grip.

288
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,810
Speaker 1: He was using that hold the joystick.

289
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:29,909
Speaker 1: He was using the dick grip instead of the finger grip.

290
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:34,550
Speaker 0: Let's go get a full photon table, make a big one of these things, and see what happens.

291
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,608
Speaker 1: The thing is, I'm pretty sure...

292
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,490
Speaker 0: You've got really powerful motors to it too, so we can go whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh.

293
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:45,969
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure even this project, just built with hardier materials on a real table, no human could beat it.

294
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,950
Speaker 1: At best you could get a draw, I would suspect.

295
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,129
Speaker 0: Well, you came up with your strategy of, instead of detecting where the puck is and moving to block it.

296
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,789
Speaker 0: Just vibrate.

297
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:06,509
Speaker 0: Just stand it completely in front of the goal and move back and forth ridiculously fast so that there is no time window period in which a puck could get through without being touched and deflected.

298
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:18,128
Speaker 1: And basically always do that unless I have a clear firing solution and then suddenly strike the puck with such speed that it will just immediately go into the goal and the human can't do anything about it.

299
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,670
Speaker 0: Faster than a human can possibly react to stop it.

300
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,190
Speaker 1: I guess you could hit it hard enough to make it like a bullet so it goes through the player's.

301
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,130
Speaker 0: What if you have two of such robots play against each other?

302
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,470
Speaker 1: I would watch that like an Olympic sport.

303
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:41,650
Speaker 0: And they're both set to have perfect defense no matter what and also attack as violently as possible whenever possible without sacrificing your ultimate defense strategy.

304
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,590
Speaker 1: You know what that's like, Scott?

305
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,489
Speaker 1: Because I've been reading all these culture books.

306
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,889
Speaker 1: That's like two equiv tech civilizations having a war.

307
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,229
Speaker 1: I'd love to watch it.

308
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:54,090
Speaker 1: It's like watching the ping pong championships.

309
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:57,190
Speaker 0: Remember that rock paper scissors robot that would cheat?

310
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

311
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,950
Speaker 0: What if we had it play against itself?

312
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,149
Speaker 1: You know, I wondered that.

313
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,450
Speaker 1: I think I even posited that question when we talked about that robot.

314
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,650
Speaker 1: It'd come down to who's the faster processor.

315
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:08,469
Speaker 0: Metamoments.

316
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,230
Speaker 0: Conventions are actually coming up really soon.

317
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,989
Speaker 0: Did you know Anime Boston was next month?

318
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, we gotta get on our fucking panels.

319
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,908
Speaker 0: What is our panels?

320
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:16,810
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

321
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,909
Speaker 1: We're doing a bunch of panels in Anime Boston, guys.

322
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,178
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

323
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we wrote a new one, though.

324
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:23,187
Speaker 1: Okay.

325
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,390
Speaker 1: Oh, no, we wrote one.

326
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,889
Speaker 1: It's the one anime that aren't what they seem.

327
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:28,070
Speaker 0: Okay.

328
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,090
Speaker 1: Like, Trigun seems silly, but oh, it's actually about pacifism.

329
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,150
Speaker 0: All right, well, you're taking care of that.

330
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,329
Speaker 1: I'll take care of that one.

331
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:34,830
Speaker 0: All right.

332
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,669
Speaker 1: PAX East.

333
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,849
Speaker 1: We got a panel ad.

334
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,749
Speaker 0: That's good.

335
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,729
Speaker 1: I don't think it was announced yet.

336
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,090
Speaker 0: Whatever.

337
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:41,910
Speaker 0: We're gonna be there.

338
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,370
Speaker 0: Come on.

339
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:43,269
Speaker 1: We're enforcing.

340
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,850
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there doing stuff.

341
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:45,830
Speaker 1: It's PAX East.

342
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:51,705
Speaker 1: No one we know is going, except fellow enforcers and speakers, because no one we know could get badges.

343
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,906
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

344
00:16:53,371 --> 00:17:01,769
Speaker 1: So, our entire friend group, except for the people who are enforcing, or our guests alongside us, is not going to PAX East, possibly ever again.

345
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:02,949
Speaker 0: Oh, that's their problem.

346
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:03,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

347
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,867
Speaker 0: Their loss.

348
00:17:04,171 --> 00:17:04,829
Speaker 1: It's hard to get badges.

349
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,807
Speaker 1: Know what you do about it.

350
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,329
Speaker 1: Uh, we're gonna be at MagFest, but that's a ways from now.

351
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,770
Speaker 0: Kineticon, while it's still a ways off, there is much preparation for it.

352
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,250
Speaker 1: We're already scheduling panels.

353
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,388
Speaker 1: If you want to do a panel, submit it fucking now.

354
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,509
Speaker 1: Time slots are disappearing, kids.

355
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:24,970
Speaker 0: Other non-convention meta stuff.

356
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:26,069
Speaker 1: ZenkaiCon we're going to.

357
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,730
Speaker 1: I forget what we're doing at that con.

358
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,270
Speaker 1: Who cares?

359
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,130
Speaker 0: Don't go to that.

360
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:30,708
Speaker 1: Someone might care.

361
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:31,989
Speaker 0: Don't go to that.

362
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:32,263
Speaker 0: Dude.

363
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,630
Speaker 0: Unless you're super desperate.

364
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:43,610
Speaker 1: If you go to ZenkaiCon, you're a Geek Nights listener, so I want you to go, because we're gonna do all our panels, and the rest of the time, we're gonna go hide in a corner and play German board games.

365
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,050
Speaker 1: So we want listeners to come play German board games with us.

366
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,549
Speaker 0: Hockey at some bar.

367
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,169
Speaker 1: We'll go watch hockey at a bar, but we'll also play German board games.

368
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,209
Speaker 0: Um, not be able to get breakfast because Panera is the only thing.

369
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,490
Speaker 1: You know, if we'd gotten up before like 11am, we probably could have gotten a fake bagel.

370
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,448
Speaker 0: Why would we do that?

371
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:12,770
Speaker 1: Seriously, I don't think you guys understand how cranky Scott gets if he can't get a bagel and some cream cheese in the morning.

372
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:13,540
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

373
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,330
Speaker 1: you don't have bagels?

374
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:15,090
Speaker 1: The fuck?

375
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,649
Speaker 1: New York?

376
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,649
Speaker 1: I could have gotten a bagel.

377
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,270
Speaker 1: Seriously.

378
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:17,728
Speaker 1: Jesus.

379
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,810
Speaker 1: Fuck this place.

380
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,749
Speaker 1: Fuck this town.

381
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,330
Speaker 0: Listen, a vampire can't go too far from his coffin.

382
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,530
Speaker 0: A New Yorker coffins like New York.

383
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,850
Speaker 0: You can't go too far away.

384
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,528
Speaker 0: It's bad news.

385
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,490
Speaker 1: Vampires.

386
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,509
Speaker 1: Oh my god, rice.

387
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:31,069
Speaker 1: How many grains are there?

388
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:37,430
Speaker 1: The Book Club book is Wool by Hugh Howie.

389
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,290
Speaker 0: Like the shit you take off of lambs and make sweaters out of.

390
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:47,490
Speaker 1: I know almost nothing about it except that so many people recommended it to me that I either want to read this really good book- And we got a pile of free copies from who the fuck knows where.

391
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,870
Speaker 1: I have at least three copies of this book.

392
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,469
Speaker 0: None of which you have paid or asked for.

393
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:53,670
Speaker 1: One of them is signed by the author.

394
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,029
Speaker 0: Okay, give me one of them.

395
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,070
Speaker 1: So I gotta find them.

396
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,629
Speaker 0: I might even actually still have one.

397
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:58,230
Speaker 1: You might.

398
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,730
Speaker 0: I should check before I take another one because I know I'll never be able to give it back.

399
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:08,230
Speaker 1: Either it's gonna be great or I'm gonna piss all over someone's parade.

400
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,789
Speaker 1: Okay.

401
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,668
Speaker 1: As this happened in the past.

402
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:11,569
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

403
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:11,989
Speaker 1: Oh!

404
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,629
Speaker 1: What else we got?

405
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:13,270
Speaker 1: YouTube.

406
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:14,128
Speaker 1: We got stuff.

407
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,410
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Presents Utena has resumed.

408
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,829
Speaker 0: We have YouTube channels.

409
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:25,649
Speaker 0: We have fucking tumbles and twits and face boxes and G pluses and pretty much every possible imaginable thing.

410
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,390
Speaker 0: Go to all those places and do the things at those places on the internet.

411
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,389
Speaker 1: Yes, and link to those things.

412
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,290
Speaker 0: If you're not on the internet, how the hell are you listening to this right now?

413
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,082
Speaker 1: And link to those things on whatever Reddit cave you hide in.

414
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:38,110
Speaker 1: because I found that I link.

415
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:45,625
Speaker 1: if I post a new thing about gaming and I go to a gaming subreddit and post a thing, I get down mod like, "Yeah, don't promote your own

416
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:45,948
Speaker 1: shit.".

417
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:51,279
Speaker 1: But if someone else who isn't me posts the same thing, it gets upvoted and everyone's like, "Oh, that's

418
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:51,728
Speaker 1: amazing.".

419
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:59,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, people have been, a few people have been occasionally posting links to our stuff on Reddit and other places and when they do, we get some traffic.

420
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:11,730
Speaker 0: So go to all the places on the internet that you go and promote us for free for absolutely no compensation whatsoever and just be a shameless and dirty shill for our benefit.

421
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,790
Speaker 1: One, it'll warm the cockles of your heart by doing that for us.

422
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:23,210
Speaker 0: And two, you might get some karmas if it gets upvoted, but based on our content, you'll be leeching off of us to get pointless internet smiley points.

423
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,310
Speaker 1: But if you do this and our stuff gets more popular, we'll do more stuff faster.

424
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:31,230
Speaker 1: We could be done with that.

425
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:38,630
Speaker 0: It's possible if everyone promotes us enough that we would get so ridiculously popular that someone would pay us to do stuff and we could quit and do stuff all day.

426
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, guys, you realize if I- You're holding us back for not promoting us enough, not because we suck.

427
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,850
Speaker 0: If this was my job- Not because our shit's not good enough.

428
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,390
Speaker 0: We'd have an episode- You are not giving us free advertising and social karmas.

429
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,410
Speaker 1: We do an episode of that Utena show like every two days.

430
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,490
Speaker 1: We would make a lot of stuff.

431
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:56,985
Speaker 0: Anyway.

432
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,230
Speaker 1: But no, instead- I have to go to work every day.

433
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,109
Speaker 1: You guys can watch PewDiePie or whatever.

434
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:04,269
Speaker 1: All right.

435
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,010
Speaker 1: So, sports technology.

436
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,110
Speaker 0: There is so much sports technology.

437
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,969
Speaker 1: The conversation Scott and I had was basically, "What do we do this show

438
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:12,090
Speaker 1: on?".

439
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,210
Speaker 1: I was like, "I don't know.

440
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,943
Speaker 1: What about sports

441
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:14,290
Speaker 1: technology?".

442
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:16,470
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess that's our crowd, people.

443
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,405
Speaker 0: I felt like we had done it already, and I know we've talked about some topics in the past, perhaps as newses.

444
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,410
Speaker 0: I feel like we talked about those Olympic super-baiting suits before, at least once.

445
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,050
Speaker 0: We have, but we've always talked about them.

446
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,610
Speaker 0: And we've talked about soccer replay and stuff like that.

447
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,870
Speaker 1: But we always talk about it from the game perspective.

448
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,190
Speaker 1: How does it affect the game, the game theory, the game, the game, the game, the game?

449
00:21:34,352 --> 00:21:35,010
Speaker 0: You're going to talk about that.

450
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,009
Speaker 0: You're going to talk about that, I guarantee, within the next 10 minutes.

451
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,247
Speaker 1: I will, but we're going to focus- You're not even denying.

452
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:45,224
Speaker 1: We're going to focus more on the tech, because basically, then we stopped chatting, and then we both were like, "Okay, I got a lot to

453
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:45,446
Speaker 1: say."

454
00:21:46,591 --> 00:22:02,870
Speaker 1: Because I realized pretty immediately that sports are literally made by their limitations in such a fundamental way that a sport that does not have arbitrary limitations on the aids and technologies that can be used becomes a meaningless sport immediately.

455
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:09,230
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I kind of want to see a sport sometimes where it's like, you can do whatever the hell you want, right?

456
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,410
Speaker 1: It's like- So I murder the team the night before in their bus.

457
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,550
Speaker 1: I mean, like- You got to have a limitation.

458
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,890
Speaker 0: Like, you can use any equipment you want, right?

459
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:27,270
Speaker 1: So it's like- The batter comes up, just shoots the pitcher, and then runs after he dropped the ball.

460
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,566
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, imagine F1.

461
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:34,330
Speaker 0: F1 has a ridiculous number of rules about how the car has to be designed.

462
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,969
Speaker 0: Imagine if the rule was, it has to be a car, right?

463
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,630
Speaker 0: Imagine if the rule was- Suddenly, driving no longer matters, and engineering is the only thing that matters.

464
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:49,910
Speaker 0: And already, it's out of state, even with all the restrictions where engineering matters perhaps more than driving, right?

465
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:59,670
Speaker 1: Well, engineering definitely matters more than driving, because as skilled as these drivers are, it's the teams that win with their better management and technology.

466
00:22:59,850 --> 00:22:59,970
Speaker 1: Right.

467
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:09,650
Speaker 0: I mean, if you look at something like baseball, it's like, okay, baseball, technology matters, I guess, some amount greater than zero, but mostly it's the person, right?

468
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:11,129
Speaker 1: Why is that the case?

469
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,450
Speaker 0: Because it is so restricted on what technology you can use.

470
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,230
Speaker 0: It's like, you can't do anything to the ball.

471
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,050
Speaker 0: Everyone has to use the same goddamn ball.

472
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,790
Speaker 0: The limitations on bats are extremely strict.

473
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine if I could just use an aluminum bat.

474
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,436
Speaker 0: Boom.

475
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:26,588
Speaker 1: Like, what?

476
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:27,186
Speaker 1: Yeah.

477
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:38,330
Speaker 0: You could just use any bat you wanted, like some ridiculous carbon fiber titanium, who knows what bat, with springs in it, and you could use any ball you wanted, like a tennis ball.

478
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:45,109
Speaker 1: What if I wear shoes that are just so big that after I hit the ball, I just lean my toe forward and I hit first base?

479
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,150
Speaker 0: Clown shoes?

480
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,477
Speaker 0: Yeah.

481
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:54,670
Speaker 0: The end of the shoes are in the dugout, and you just sort of tilt your shoe to the right, and suddenly- I'm on first base.

482
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:55,110
Speaker 1: I'm on first.

483
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:56,350
Speaker 1: I'm not going to make it to second.

484
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:05,330
Speaker 0: It springs in your shoes, so as soon as you hit the ball, you jump and you launch in the air like a trampoline- And just land on first base.

485
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,670
Speaker 0: And then you go boingy, and you land on second base, boingy, third base, boingy, home plate.

486
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,130
Speaker 1: What if I just wear armor with spikes and just charge the guy at first base?

487
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,769
Speaker 1: Well, I guess no, because if he catches it, I'm out no matter what.

488
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,070
Speaker 1: It would only work charging second or third base.

489
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:26,570
Speaker 0: Sure, but there are other sports where the technology doesn't dominate the physical ability, but it matters.

490
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,829
Speaker 0: Something like golf, right?

491
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:32,590
Speaker 0: In golf, for me, it doesn't matter what the fuck golf clubs I use, I suck, right?

492
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:36,630
Speaker 0: I could take Tiger Woods' own golf bag and I'm not going to win shit.

493
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,669
Speaker 0: Tiger Woods is even winning shit with his golf bag lately, right?

494
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:51,190
Speaker 0: But if you're good enough at golf to where your skill is really high, suddenly the changing clubs can actually make a difference.

495
00:24:51,470 --> 00:25:00,910
Speaker 0: Getting a lighter club or one with a better head or something is going to maybe give you an extra 10 yards on the drive or whatever, and that can make a difference in winning and losing.

496
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,088
Speaker 0: It'll save you a stroke here, a stroke there, right?

497
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,719
Speaker 0: Bowling, it's like changing.

498
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,130
Speaker 0: which ball you're using could matter significantly.

499
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:12,030
Speaker 0: If you're already good at bowling, changing your ball starts to matter.

500
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:18,821
Speaker 0: It's not like I can take the champion's bowling ball and win, because human ability matters more, but it's not.

501
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:20,350
Speaker 0: the technology doesn't matter whatsoever.

502
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,669
Speaker 0: Olympic bathing suits, you already talked about those long ago, right?

503
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:40,690
Speaker 1: Some sports, every sport is different, so some sports are really restricting the technology to focus on the human competition, but then the human competition becomes almost the technology of training and engineering humans, which is also technology.

504
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:47,626
Speaker 1: I mean, look at the monsters we breed to compete in highly specialized professional sports.

505
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:54,950
Speaker 1: Now, we don't breed them in vats yet, but that will happen probably in our lifetime.

506
00:25:55,831 --> 00:26:00,490
Speaker 1: If not in vats, then at least through positive eugenics programs.

507
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:08,030
Speaker 1: I say positive as opposed to negative, positive meaning encouraging certain breeding patterns as opposed to negative of kill the babies Sparta style.

508
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:19,489
Speaker 0: I mean, basically, I mean for football, I know a lot of football players like Samoans, I think there's still, I think it was documentary about how they basically breed football players in Samoa.

509
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:32,029
Speaker 1: Or look at biking, no amount of training, if you get equivalent training, the only determining factors in bicycle races, long distance races are either luck, as in equipment failure.

510
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:43,590
Speaker 1: or someone hits you or something crazy, or your legs are this slightly longer or your lungs are slightly bigger or you have a freakish amount of red blood cells or you dope or you do steroids.

511
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone talks about Lance Armstrong's cheating, right?

512
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,750
Speaker 0: But think about it, he cheated and won when everyone else also cheated.

513
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,630
Speaker 0: It wasn't like he was the only cheater, right?

514
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,530
Speaker 0: And he won every single goddamn time.

515
00:26:53,851 --> 00:27:01,189
Speaker 0: If no one cheated, he probably also would have won every single time because his body is freakish like that.

516
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:05,970
Speaker 1: Yep, so the technology of sports is also the technology of training humans.

517
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:12,089
Speaker 1: I mean, Olympic athletes, the intervals for some of these events have come down to random chance as to who wins.

518
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:17,806
Speaker 1: It's the start of a lot of these short foot races matter more than any amount of training or skill.

519
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:24,047
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the training and skill of being able to anticipate and do the start without fouling it.

520
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,350
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, Usain Bolt is just freakishly large, right?

521
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,010
Speaker 0: I mean, he's had the same training as everyone else, right?

522
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,049
Speaker 0: But he wins every time.

523
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:36,330
Speaker 0: Well, he wins almost every time just because genetics are mattered more.

524
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:50,470
Speaker 1: So what will happen, like technology-wise, we limit these sports from external chemicals and we limit them from technology and equipment outside of the bounds of a very limited set.

525
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,830
Speaker 1: It's sort of a prescriptive designation like in baseball.

526
00:27:54,332 --> 00:28:07,212
Speaker 1: A baseball bat is defined by X and you may not deviate from it by more than Y and Z, but there are no rules about the genetic side of it or scouting people who have freakish qualities.

527
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:13,029
Speaker 1: that would make them better at the sport fundamentally, but that is also technology of being able to find and train those people.

528
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's also no rules about breeding the people.

529
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:24,450
Speaker 0: It's just you can't use certain chemicals on your body after you're born, but it didn't say anything about like, hey, let's get, you know, they do it for horses, right?

530
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,829
Speaker 0: They already do it for horses.

531
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,905
Speaker 0: There's no rule against doing it for people, but just people don't, or at least haven't yet.

532
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:56,439
Speaker 1: You know, I think a lot of people would have ethical concerns about it, but if you wanted to make money, you should probably make a company that finds people who are good at football or have the physical attributes that make them predisposed toward being good at football, and come up with the programs to get them to marry, form couples, have babies, and then train those babies basically their entire lives for a shot at being in major league football.

533
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:07,500
Speaker 0: No, what they should do is you should basically get them to sign a bunch of papers giving you that, you know, you basically make the baby in a test tube by borrowing genetics from those people.

534
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,239
Speaker 1: I think there's laws against that right now.

535
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,800
Speaker 0: And they sign the baby over to your company.

536
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:13,419
Speaker 1: It's now, you are now.

537
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:17,459
Speaker 1: I was trying to come up with a business model that wouldn't immediately get crucified in the media.

538
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Speaker 0: Your company is now the, you know, legal guardian of these babies, and then you raise them in football school, and your company is this football school, and then they, you know, the babies, while they're still, you know, when they make money, you take a percentage of the money they make because you're their agent.

539
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:46,720
Speaker 1: Now there's also, there's a subtle thing that, it's subtle in some sports, that people seem to forget how goddamn dangerous most sports were even as recently as 40 and 50 years ago.

540
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,720
Speaker 1: Like football is probably more dangerous now, but that's a separate thing.

541
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,040
Speaker 0: Safety in sports is actually relatively recent.

542
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:03,740
Speaker 0: Like there's been concern for safety perhaps my whole life, you know, even when I was in school playing sports, but most sports, even in the 80s and 90s were ridiculously dangerous.

543
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:05,356
Speaker 1: Look at old timey car racing.

544
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,574
Speaker 0: When I watched NASCAR in the 90s, people were getting killed, right, in ridiculous crazy crashes.

545
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,197
Speaker 1: What about the ground effects era in F1?

546
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:12,960
Speaker 0: Right.

547
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,700
Speaker 0: It's just, every, they just, you know, they went for winning for the sake of safety.

548
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,340
Speaker 0: Hockey, people in my lifetime played ice hockey with no helmets.

549
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,171
Speaker 1: Yeah.

550
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:23,359
Speaker 1: No helmets.

551
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:26,700
Speaker 1: Not like no face masks, which was later, but that was also true.

552
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:30,300
Speaker 1: Like a lot, when I saw hockey games, almost no one wore face masks when I was a kid.

553
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like helmets.

554
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,579
Speaker 0: Except the goalie.

555
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,100
Speaker 0: Helmets were added to hockey within my life.

556
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,559
Speaker 1: Face masks were added to goalies not that long ago.

557
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:37,953
Speaker 1: Right.

558
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,940
Speaker 1: And the old face masks didn't work so well.

559
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:41,380
Speaker 1: No.

560
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,159
Speaker 1: There was a time.

561
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,520
Speaker 0: The Jason style, I dare you to wear that and play hockey.

562
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:45,218
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

563
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,040
Speaker 1: You would, if a modern hockey player wore the Jason mask in a modern hockey game.

564
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,160
Speaker 0: And a puck hit him in the face.

565
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,320
Speaker 1: They would spend most of their time dodging pucks rather than trying to stop them.

566
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:03,960
Speaker 0: Did you know that one of the rules of Olympic hockey that differs from regular NHL hockey is that if the puck hits the goalie in the face mask that you stop play?

567
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:05,398
Speaker 1: Wow.

568
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:06,248
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

569
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,780
Speaker 1: That's, I almost want to say that's BS, but at the same time that's probably better.

570
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,019
Speaker 0: There's an interesting thing that lists all the differences between Olympic hockey and NHL hockey.

571
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,939
Speaker 0: And Olympic hockey is pretty much just better.

572
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, in almost every way.

573
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:20,900
Speaker 0: In almost every way.

574
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,440
Speaker 1: Is it still, I remember there was a point where I think it was actually a wider hockey.

575
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:25,140
Speaker 0: It is wider.

576
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,820
Speaker 0: It's still wider.

577
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,457
Speaker 1: It's bigger, yeah.

578
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Speaker 1: Because I remember during the trap era of hockey, watching games and being so frustrated, then thinking about Olympic hockey and realizing that that kind of fixed that problem.

579
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,579
Speaker 0: Olympic hockey is just bigger ice.

580
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:39,276
Speaker 1: Wider ice.

581
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,139
Speaker 1: Longer ice would not make for a more interesting game, but wider ice certainly does.

582
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,880
Speaker 0: But yeah, bicycling we talked about a bit already, but the technology in bicycling actually is pretty significant.

583
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,680
Speaker 1: Well, remember the famous story of before modern bikes, I mean you had penny fire things which were just death traps.

584
00:31:56,661 --> 00:32:03,439
Speaker 1: Just bicycling used to have a reputation for being one of the more deadly and ridiculously stupid things a young man could ever do.

585
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:09,299
Speaker 1: And when the modern bicycle was invented, people scoffed at it.

586
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:15,640
Speaker 1: And then a woman beat the best bicyclist in the world trivially with a modern bicycle.

587
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,499
Speaker 1: Having gears literally made her the best bicyclist in the entire world.

588
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:35,020
Speaker 0: But yeah, so they keep developing technology of bikes, but they don't allow all those technologies in say the Tour de France, they have minimum weights and stuff, even though we could make some lighter bike that was like 100% carbon fiber ridiculousness.

589
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, well like tennis has that.

590
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,371
Speaker 1: I for a long time used a tennis racket.

591
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:39,920
Speaker 1: that would not be legal for tournaments.

592
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:43,260
Speaker 1: Wouldn't be legal in a real competition, but they sold it.

593
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,540
Speaker 0: Was it actually superior?

594
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,480
Speaker 0: Because a lot of times you go to the store, right?

595
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,700
Speaker 1: Yes, it was actually superior.

596
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,639
Speaker 1: It had that weird weave.

597
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:55,980
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of times you'll go to like the sporting goods store and they'll be like buy this tennis racket and they'll be like look at how much fancy shit it is.

598
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,759
Speaker 0: It's so expensive.

599
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:57,659
Speaker 0: It must be better.

600
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:03,580
Speaker 0: And it's like, no, actually it's just a bunch of gimmicky nonsense they're using to trick you into spending a lot more money on a tennis racket.

601
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,840
Speaker 1: So I had a racquetball racket that was just too big to be legal.

602
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,660
Speaker 1: It was just bigger.

603
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,560
Speaker 0: Well, just bigger is just better, right?

604
00:33:09,642 --> 00:33:09,834
Speaker 0: Yes.

605
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:11,459
Speaker 0: I mean, there's no question about that.

606
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,178
Speaker 1: But then my dad was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, and then he made me play with like an old school racquetball racket.

607
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:18,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the ones that are like that big.

608
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,627
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, oh.

609
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,560
Speaker 1: Granted, even with my cheating racket, he could still beat me trivially even if he had the shit racket.

610
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:30,760
Speaker 0: Listen, the older you are, you don't even have to know what racquetball is.

611
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:35,200
Speaker 0: If you just get old, your racquetball skill increases exponentially.

612
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,556
Speaker 0: Yep.

613
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,359
Speaker 1: If you're a man and you're over 50, you'll stand in the middle of a racquetball tournament and just beat people even if you don't realize you're there.

614
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,280
Speaker 1: Like you'll wake up in a racquetball tournament like, what?

615
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,940
Speaker 1: Where am I?

616
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,799
Speaker 1: And you're at the top of the ladder.

617
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:52,360
Speaker 0: And next thing you know, you're standing in the shower room completely naked with all the other old men.

618
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,819
Speaker 0: You got one leg up on the bench.

619
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,678
Speaker 1: Oh, the one leg.

620
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,979
Speaker 0: Airing out the junk, chatting up about, hey, did you see that?

621
00:33:58,602 --> 00:33:59,700
Speaker 0: And that's where it goes.

622
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:00,754
Speaker 1: That's the life.

623
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:02,777
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to those days.

624
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:04,598
Speaker 1: Those are going to be good days.

625
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:06,699
Speaker 0: You can enjoy those days alone.

626
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,500
Speaker 1: But seriously, like skiing, because I ski a lot.

627
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:22,500
Speaker 1: Skiing is a big part of my life and the technology of skiing has literally changed the sport in a way to where skiing 20 years ago is unrecognizable to skiing today.

628
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,659
Speaker 1: If you took someone from today, put them in skis from 20 years ago and said, ski, they would probably die.

629
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:28,458
Speaker 0: Well, it's the same.

630
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,364
Speaker 0: You know, they always.

631
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:35,380
Speaker 0: it keeps coming back on the Internet over and over again, the one comparing the Olympic vault from a long time ago to today.

632
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:40,518
Speaker 0: It's like in the old vault, it's like the lady runs, jumps, flips once over the vault and lands.

633
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,092
Speaker 0: And now it's like this land, right?

634
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:45,360
Speaker 0: It's the same level of development.

635
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,895
Speaker 0: That's such an easy visualization to show how much development there has been in that sport.

636
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:54,360
Speaker 0: But pretty much every other sport has developed just as much in that same time period.

637
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,539
Speaker 1: Well, I think think of this.

638
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:04,980
Speaker 1: There's a there's a turn called a stem Christie and there's all these turns and skiing, which basically involve like skidding and like twisting and throwing the back end of your skis out.

639
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:14,998
Speaker 1: But there's a turn called the carving turn, which you can really only do the way that people do it today with modern skis that have a special shape that no one made skis like that a long time ago.

640
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,439
Speaker 1: So I can turn in ways that were literally impossible when I was learning how to ski when I was young.

641
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,399
Speaker 1: And also the binding technology has changed so much that I mean, look at the old stereotype of skiing.

642
00:35:26,864 --> 00:35:28,140
Speaker 1: It's ridiculously dangerous.

643
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,676
Speaker 0: It still is.

644
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,831
Speaker 1: Well, now it really isn't.

645
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,440
Speaker 1: I actually found some statistics.

646
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:40,060
Speaker 0: Skiing deaths per thousand skiers are pretty low and comparable to going to the hospital in critical condition, but not dying.

647
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:41,700
Speaker 1: That counts as a casualty.

648
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:43,919
Speaker 0: How about breaking a leg?

649
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:46,040
Speaker 1: Actually, not super common.

650
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,239
Speaker 0: Breaking anything.

651
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,578
Speaker 1: I broke a nail once.

652
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,440
Speaker 0: Breaking a bone.

653
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:53,859
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way.

654
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,220
Speaker 1: In the old days, skiing was so dangerous.

655
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,940
Speaker 1: And what was the stare to watch any movie about skiing?

656
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 1: There's always the guy in like a full leg cast sitting in the lodge by the fire.

657
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,303
Speaker 1: That's like.

658
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:06,039
Speaker 1: that's like every ski movie had that thing.

659
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:07,079
Speaker 0: Not going to go skiing.

660
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:10,060
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen nearly as much anymore.

661
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:14,100
Speaker 0: You're telling me that when you were at the ski lodge last, there was not a guy there in traction.

662
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,239
Speaker 1: There was not.

663
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:16,080
Speaker 0: You sure?

664
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,559
Speaker 1: I am 100 percent sure.

665
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:19,279
Speaker 0: Maybe he was taking a nap.

666
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:21,894
Speaker 1: And one way I was talking to an old timer like this.

667
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:36,540
Speaker 1: guy's been skiing at this mountain for like 40 years and he was talking about how there's a run on the back mountain that in the old days, only the most expert pro in the world could even get down it because it's just this icy, cliffy bullshit.

668
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,700
Speaker 1: But today with modern skis, I can ski down that thing.

669
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:46,265
Speaker 1: And he was like, yeah, the modern skis opened up all these trails in the old days, like only super pros could go on.

670
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:55,080
Speaker 1: the technology literally made trails that used to be considered expert trails become like a normal trail that a good skier would ski on.

671
00:36:56,062 --> 00:37:08,480
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, when you tend to think about technology improving like sports, right, you tend to think about the equipment you use for the sport, things you've been talking about, rackets, skis, uniforms, you know, bathing suits, golf clubs, right?

672
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:14,963
Speaker 0: There's a lot of technology you can use to improve at a sport that doesn't actually get used on the field.

673
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:23,960
Speaker 0: I just read an article about how some of the skiers were using wind tunnels, right, to optimize their skiing before going to the Olympics.

674
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:24,982
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:37:25,002 --> 00:37:28,477
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, footballs, right, American footballs.

676
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:45,144
Speaker 0: They used to in the olden days take pictures of the field with a photo camera, develop the photo, right, with chemicals, put it on a, you know, a clothespin on a rope with pulleys and wheel it down this giant clothesline from the top of the stadium to the coach at the at the sideline.

677
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:53,061
Speaker 0: Nowadays, they take the picture and it's digital and then the coach can see it on a, you know, print it out and look at it right to see what's going on.

678
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:57,320
Speaker 1: Now, imagine how much sports change if you have access to that kind of technology.

679
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,363
Speaker 0: Right.

680
00:37:58,463 --> 00:38:03,639
Speaker 0: People are talking about how, you know, basketball, they might let him have tablets or something on this.

681
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:04,202
Speaker 0: Yep.

682
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,216
Speaker 1: There's a big talk about changing basketball.

683
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,524
Speaker 1: They might have already done it.

684
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:10,989
Speaker 1: I don't follow too closely to give the coaches access to a lot more data.

685
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,100
Speaker 1: live at the game.

686
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:12,441
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:13,788
Speaker 0: So it's theoretically possible.

688
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:17,340
Speaker 0: you could develop a technology to where I mean, when you shoot in basketball.

689
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:17,722
Speaker 0: Right.

690
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:20,199
Speaker 0: It's in the air for about a second or so.

691
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,537
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't, you know, fly through the air like bam.

692
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,201
Speaker 0: Right.

693
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:26,220
Speaker 0: It's going like it goes up and then down and then in the back in the hoop.

694
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,540
Speaker 0: Right.

695
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,800
Speaker 0: You could have a camera set up that would be looking at the basketball.

696
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:31,526
Speaker 0: Right.

697
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:33,060
Speaker 0: Figure out its trajectory.

698
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:43,720
Speaker 0: And the camera plus a computer would know immediately after the ball was released from a player's hands whether that was going to be a swoosh, bounce off the rim and rebound, be an airball or whatever.

699
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,400
Speaker 1: And if rebound, what direction?

700
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:45,821
Speaker 0: Right.

701
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:54,440
Speaker 0: So the coach sitting there looking at his tablet, as soon as someone takes a shot, he could look and it would tell him with enough time to yell out like rebound.

702
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:57,140
Speaker 0: And then the players would know how to react to that.

703
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:59,800
Speaker 1: But both coaches would have access to the same technology.

704
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:02,680
Speaker 0: The only way to communicate that to the players would be to yell it out.

705
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,800
Speaker 1: Now, what if you let the players have displays somehow Google Glass?

706
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,220
Speaker 1: Like some equivalent of that to where you just get hurt using that.

708
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:11,940
Speaker 1: Well, what if they design one that wouldn't hurt?

709
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:20,640
Speaker 1: Imagine if every time you shot, it's like as you're shooting, like you're put, you're going up, it shows the projected trajectory and you make subtle movements to your wrist.

710
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:25,199
Speaker 1: It changes the projection so you know if it's going to go in or even forget that.

711
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,280
Speaker 1: not in the game and training.

712
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:41,939
Speaker 1: What if in tennis you have a device on your arm and a camera and all these things that every time you serve, it makes noises and gives you immediate feedback as to how effective your serve was to allow you to train your body's muscle memory to always give a perfect serve.

713
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,970
Speaker 0: You toss the ball up in the air and it beeps.

714
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,300
Speaker 0: at the moment you should have made contact with the ball.

715
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:46,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

716
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:50,480
Speaker 1: Or it makes a noise like like to kind of give you the motion and the timing and everything.

717
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:50,801
Speaker 0: Yeah.

718
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:52,460
Speaker 1: So two things.

719
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,940
Speaker 1: One, having that technology to train will make you a very effective player.

720
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,260
Speaker 1: Two, what if you could use that technology during the game?

721
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,500
Speaker 1: That's like the in drag racing, which I think is a stupid sport.

722
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,360
Speaker 1: I think it's a great competition for engineers.

723
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,080
Speaker 1: But as a sport with a human in the car, I think it's dumb.

724
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,441
Speaker 0: Right.

725
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:14,263
Speaker 1: But because basically a computer just says shift, shift, shift, shift, shift, shift, shift.

726
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:15,560
Speaker 1: It tells you when to shift.

727
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,168
Speaker 1: The human just goes.

728
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:16,698
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

729
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:16,981
Speaker 0: Right.

730
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:23,680
Speaker 0: Is that the more, you know, if you use technology to like figure out what to do beforehand, like NFL film study.

731
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:24,244
Speaker 0: Right.

732
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:26,480
Speaker 0: That's just figuring out strategies and stuff.

733
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,040
Speaker 0: I mean, I even do that for now runner.

734
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,260
Speaker 0: I'm like studying, you know, watching people's games and people chess.

735
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,203
Speaker 0: People do it right.

736
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:40,820
Speaker 0: But the more you use that during the game, basically what ends up happening is it's less and less a battle of humans and a battle of computers.

737
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,764
Speaker 0: It's all right.

738
00:40:41,824 --> 00:40:45,602
Speaker 0: My computer is really doing all the work, but it's controlling this human.

739
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:50,436
Speaker 0: So we need humans that are really good at being controlled by computers, which is not hard DDR.

740
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,951
Speaker 0: And then it becomes which computer is better.

741
00:40:55,332 --> 00:41:03,760
Speaker 0: and maybe a tiny fraction of it is which human is better at being controlled by the computer, which is making all the decisions because it's better at making those decisions than a human can and faster.

742
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:04,902
Speaker 0: Right.

743
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:14,260
Speaker 0: So like eventually, like if you had an athlete with the computer was making all the decisions and the computer was just better and perfect, it's not you and you would.

744
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,780
Speaker 0: basically it's going faster than your reaction time.

745
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:24,379
Speaker 0: So you basically have to not react and you sort of be able to like give up your will and allow the computer to control you.

746
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,100
Speaker 1: But at that point, now you're relying upon the failings of that individual human.

747
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,799
Speaker 1: So breeding technology and genetics become important again.

748
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:32,289
Speaker 1: Or fuck it.

749
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:33,720
Speaker 1: Why even have the human involved?

750
00:41:34,985 --> 00:41:36,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just robot battle.

751
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,580
Speaker 0: That's really, you know, and it's like we've had battle bots, which isn't that exciting.

752
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,360
Speaker 1: Battle bots is actually kind of shit.

753
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,143
Speaker 1: Like I've always.

754
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:49,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, the idea is cool, but battle bots is always implemented with so many restrictions and the contests are always so lame.

755
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,226
Speaker 1: I want to see a battle bot.

756
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:54,806
Speaker 0: that's basically you make any bot you want and you make any bot you want.

757
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:56,300
Speaker 1: You want you want to put guns in there.

758
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:56,685
Speaker 1: Fine.

759
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:57,680
Speaker 1: How much ammo do you carry?

760
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,673
Speaker 1: Go fucking nuts.

761
00:41:58,856 --> 00:41:59,119
Speaker 0: Right.

762
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,699
Speaker 0: You want to, you know, it's like just do it.

763
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,979
Speaker 1: My bot is just a whole bunch of bombs.

764
00:42:04,343 --> 00:42:05,900
Speaker 0: Your bot has to survive those bombs.

765
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just rolls bombs out.

766
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:08,665
Speaker 1: It can.

767
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:10,460
Speaker 1: it can deal with up to 10 bots.

768
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:11,364
Speaker 0: Bowling ball.

769
00:42:11,384 --> 00:42:13,360
Speaker 1: It's got 10 bowling ball candle bombs.

770
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:14,734
Speaker 0: It's a 20 round turn.

771
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,839
Speaker 1: I have n bomb and plus one bombs and being the number of rounds.

772
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, good luck.

773
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:25,285
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, I want to see.

774
00:42:25,868 --> 00:42:29,100
Speaker 0: it's like I kind of want to see computer versus computer.

775
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,220
Speaker 1: I want to see F1 races like those same cars drive themselves.

776
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, self-driving cars, same size cars, same tracks and maybe even some.

777
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,700
Speaker 0: But if it's a self-driving car, you don't care about safety anymore.

778
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,860
Speaker 0: So just make the cars no rules.

779
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:46,580
Speaker 0: It has to be a four wheeled motorized vehicle with some sort of.

780
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,900
Speaker 1: I would like a restriction that they have to be above a certain size just so they're big and interesting.

781
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,423
Speaker 0: Of course.

782
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has to be above a certain size.

783
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,200
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I have this tiny little rocket car.

784
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:54,603
Speaker 1: There's.

785
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:56,040
Speaker 0: Well, I think you can have a weight limit.

786
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:56,344
Speaker 0: Right.

787
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:57,418
Speaker 0: It has to weigh at least X.

788
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,560
Speaker 1: Maybe even do something cool like have a fake human that you put in there.

789
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:06,039
Speaker 1: And there is a secondary rule of that fake human can't get destroyed by the end, like protect the egg.

790
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:08,480
Speaker 1: That could make it more interesting.

791
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,679
Speaker 1: Maybe you just have this.

792
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,020
Speaker 0: But imagine how lame it would be.

793
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,660
Speaker 0: You're watching the sport on TV and it's like, oh, the red car lost.

794
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,720
Speaker 0: The fake human thing inside got hurt.

795
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:23,340
Speaker 1: Oh, no, because you get the video of the fake human thing like exploding in the shower of it would like its head would shake back and forth.

796
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,499
Speaker 0: You know, he's got whiplash.

797
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,339
Speaker 0: Technically, the sensor says he would be in a coma right now.

798
00:43:28,123 --> 00:43:28,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, fine.

799
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:29,160
Speaker 1: You know what?

800
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,764
Speaker 1: Then trigger it.

801
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:31,418
Speaker 1: If you kill the human, your car blows up.

802
00:43:32,422 --> 00:43:33,007
Speaker 0: There we go.

803
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,760
Speaker 0: Now we're talking explosions.

804
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,920
Speaker 1: Even with technology, competition is only fun if there are arbitrary constraints of some kind.

805
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,220
Speaker 1: I mean, otherwise, I kidnap your robot engineer the night before and make him put a virus in.

806
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:48,340
Speaker 1: I mean, you've got to have some constraints.

807
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,060
Speaker 0: I mean, really, what this all comes down to is the old nerd versus jock battle.

808
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,760
Speaker 0: And if we can turn every sport into actually something where the engineers are what matters and not the athletes.

809
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,900
Speaker 1: And football is already real close to that.

810
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,172
Speaker 0: Then we can just eliminate all jocks and there's rule everything.

811
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:05,220
Speaker 0: because you'll be like high school football, right?

812
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,740
Speaker 0: We'll be a robot battle.

813
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:10,100
Speaker 0: So it'll be all programmers in the high school football team, right?

814
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,019
Speaker 0: High school basketball team also full of programmers.

815
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:17,900
Speaker 0: We won't need to separate men's and women's sports at all because it's just engineers.

816
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:27,560
Speaker 1: Now, what's interesting is that in non-competitive sports or non-professional sports like skiing for me, like ski races left some arbitrary rules about things.

817
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,520
Speaker 1: But me as a skier, I will use the level of technology that makes my experience the most enjoyable.

818
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:37,720
Speaker 1: Maybe I want a challenge and I use like not as good as skis and I try to ski like particular courses.

819
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:38,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, get killed.

820
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:38,638
Speaker 0: Yeah.

821
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:43,180
Speaker 1: Or maybe I use things that wouldn't be allowed in the tournament because it makes skiing more pleasant for me.

822
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:44,859
Speaker 1: I mean, there's biking too.

823
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,360
Speaker 1: Like I could get a bike that would not be allowed in the Tour de France.

824
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,000
Speaker 0: I see people with them all the goddamn time in the city.

825
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,860
Speaker 1: And it'd be really fucking awesome for certain kinds of biking.

826
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:59,240
Speaker 1: Like if I wanted to bike, I don't know, to Florida, I'd probably get one of those cheating goddamn bikes.

827
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:01,538
Speaker 0: You couldn't really carry anything on it.

828
00:45:02,361 --> 00:45:05,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I biked to Florida, I would do the stop at a hotel every night bike.

829
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,960
Speaker 0: You would do the someone drives behind you in a car situation?

830
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:11,320
Speaker 1: Or I would do the stop at a hotel every night.

831
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,300
Speaker 0: Where are you keeping your clothing?

832
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,959
Speaker 1: I'd wash it in the hotel that night.

833
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:16,020
Speaker 0: And you'd be naked.

834
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:17,504
Speaker 1: OK, fine.

835
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:19,800
Speaker 1: I carry one extra set of clothing.

836
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:22,420
Speaker 1: Scott, it'd be all like lycra.

837
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,560
Speaker 1: So I just roll it up and put it into my jacket.

838
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,336
Speaker 0: Oh, like, OK.

839
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:25,878
Speaker 0: Yeah.

840
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,060
Speaker 0: All everything you have is in those three pouches in the back of the jersey.

841
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,058
Speaker 1: Clothes that would pass the legal definition of clothing in those pockets, along with my wallet, keys and cell phone.

842
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,520
Speaker 0: It would be like those, what's it called, the T-shirts at Muji.

843
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:43,227
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

844
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:44,079
Speaker 1: They come in a tiny cube.

845
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:44,999
Speaker 0: Come in a tiny cube.

846
00:45:46,262 --> 00:45:49,280
Speaker 1: I like how those things are so wrinkled from the cube that you can never unwrinkle them.

847
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,951
Speaker 0: You can.

848
00:45:51,032 --> 00:45:51,660
Speaker 0: A lot of hard work.

849
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're not supposed to.

850
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:53,580
Speaker 1: That's the style.

851
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

852
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,409
Speaker 0: But that's why I bought all those heat tech and those lycra.

853
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:00,119
Speaker 1: Like, compression shirts.

854
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,498
Speaker 0: They're so tiny.

855
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:05,259
Speaker 1: I could fit like four hundred of them in my suitcase if I wanted to.

856
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,296
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

857
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:08,570
Speaker 1: Why not?

858
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,239
Speaker 1: It doesn't affect you.

859
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,039
Speaker 1: I should make Ignite shirts like that.

860
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:13,338
Speaker 0: Do whatever you can do.

861
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:15,309
Speaker 0: All right.

862
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:15,980
Speaker 0: Do we have anything else?

863
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,060
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know.

864
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,800
Speaker 1: You guys have any questions about this stuff?

865
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:19,780
Speaker 0: I'm just really hungry.

866
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,020
Speaker 1: I'm also really hungry.

867
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,740
Speaker 0: And it's getting seven o'clock.

868
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,238
Speaker 1: Oh, now they know when we do the show.

869
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:28,079
Speaker 0: In what time zone?

870
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:36,620
Speaker 1: Oh, this has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

871
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,780
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

872
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,180

873
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,080
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

874
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,840
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
