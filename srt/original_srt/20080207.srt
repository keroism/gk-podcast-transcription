Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:38,653
Speaker 1: So for the last several years Scott has often had I mean not often But he's had some crazy stories of things that have happened on the train in the morning.

7
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:42,049
Speaker 0: and son happened on your train this Morning for the first time.

8
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:46,595

9
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:47,862
Speaker 1: He wasn't crazy That was just.

10
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:48,767
Speaker 1: that was funny.

11
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:53,780
Speaker 1: and there was another equally funny one actually yesterday Where this guy was on the phone, right?

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,239
Speaker 1: You know normally when someone's loud on the phone on the train everyone's like shut up or the conductor says shut up.

13
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:08,240
Speaker 1: the guy was so funny and and just the way what he was saying that Basically the whole it was just a comedy routine for everyone on the car including the conductor.

14
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,029
Speaker 1: Basically his conversation was like this man.

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,536
Speaker 1: No ma listen to me ma ma ma ma.

16
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:15,038

22
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:47,760
Speaker 1: everyone in the crowd like everyone sat there for a while and then one guy started clapping and The guy got really embarrassed and he kind of looked around like her and then he got on another car And I didn't see him for the rest of the ride.

23
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:51,825
Speaker 0: But today it wasn't.

24
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:55,360
Speaker 0: this is why they tell you when you're on the cell phone you should go in the vestibule.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,407
Speaker 0: That's did Alex and vestibule.

26
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:10,021
Speaker 1: I do too, you know what a vestibule is very much like a Boy a how about a Macadamia Gazebo.

27
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:10,363
Speaker 0: All right.

28
00:02:10,484 --> 00:02:15,160
Speaker 1: All right, but no today I had something one of those kind of bad interesting things happen.

29
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,272
Speaker 1: So I get on the train and you know, there's a there's a girl.

30
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:20,420
Speaker 0: I just had two things in the same day.

31
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:21,566
Speaker 1: Well, this was today.

32
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:22,451
Speaker 1: The other thing was yesterday.

33
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:22,893
Speaker 0: Okay.

34
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:23,980
Speaker 1: So today I get on the train.

35
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:30,746
Speaker 1: I'm I walked and there's a girl kind of laying in one of the seats and I think all right the conductor who's going to Make her move?

36
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:32,540
Speaker 1: because this trains always crazy crowded.

37
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,791
Speaker 0: She was unconscious or something.

38
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:45,029
Speaker 1: No, she seems she was sitting there just Alright, so I put my earplugs in and I'm just kind of half asleep and then I hear moaning Uh-huh, and is she pregnant or something?

39
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,394
Speaker 1: Well, yes, but I'll get to that.

40
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:50,286
Speaker 1: Oh, so I'm thinking alright And I look around.

41
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:52,175
Speaker 1: I see other people kind of look into my direction.

42
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,320
Speaker 0: I already figured this one out.

43
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:53,946
Speaker 1: So I take the.

44
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,420
Speaker 1: now you didn't alright.

45
00:02:55,561 --> 00:03:02,626
Speaker 1: so I take the earplugs out and I hear moans of pain and whimpering and all sorts of trouble from Behind me where that girl was.

46
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:03,309
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,447
Speaker 1: So I turn around and I look and Ask her if she's okay, and she doesn't respond.

48
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:10,691
Speaker 1: She just keeps moaning.

49
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,360
Speaker 0: and then where did she get on Poughkeepsie?

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,968
Speaker 1: I guess so.

51
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:30,391
Speaker 1: then I'm thinking like alright I'm gonna get the conductor and do something and then the guy sitting across like in across the aisle in the same row looks at me and says you got a problem boss and I'm like, uh, this woman seems like she needs help.

52
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:30,872
Speaker 1: She's like he's.

53
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:41,729
Speaker 1: and then he says mind your business uh-huh, uh-huh, and That that is the moment when all the other people sitting on the train start saying Oh, this woman is clearly in pain and needs help.

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,280
Speaker 1: Who are you - and he's like mind your business you people.

55
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,752
Speaker 1: He's getting really agitated.

56
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:51,172
Speaker 0: Uh-oh Obviously, there's a daytime talk show situation happening here.

57
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,779
Speaker 1: It's a it gets far worse than this.

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,760
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I see a need for police and ambulance involvement already, so I've got my cell phone out.

59
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,900
Speaker 1: I'm ready to call the police just in case the situation escalates quick.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,939
Speaker 0: I would have called 9-1-1 as soon as that guy said mind your business.

61
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:14,520
Speaker 1: Well the reason I didn't because we were in between Stops and the conductor was in the next car about to get there and the conductor can get police much more quickly.

62
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,660
Speaker 1: I would have I would have gone to get the conductor and you know immediately Yeah, but he was right there and it looked like someone else was already talking to him pointing in our direction.

63
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:29,507
Speaker 1: So things were things were going in the right direction All right, and pretty much this dude had the whole train car already ready to jump him if anything was going on You know.

64
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:34,997
Speaker 1: So, uh, the conductor gets there and he asked what's going on and everyone kind of starts to explain.

65
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:37,505
Speaker 1: and he asked the woman Are you okay, and she won't answer him.

66
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:38,970
Speaker 1: You need paramedics.

67
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:39,793
Speaker 1: You won't answer him.

68
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,299
Speaker 1: She just won't say a word to him.

69
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:44,068
Speaker 0: So you turn pregnant, right?

70
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,075
Speaker 1: I found that out later.

71
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,640
Speaker 0: So do I did she look pregnant?

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,592
Speaker 0: She wasn't very pregnant.

73
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:53,986
Speaker 1: she looked like a mid-20s woman, okay She wasn't going into labor.

74
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,592
Speaker 1: that I did the story is not.

75
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,460
Speaker 1: rim delivered a baby on the way to work.

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,340
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but I was saying, you know, I asked if she was pregnant.

77
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,662
Speaker 0: So I sort of assumed that you know, you said yes, so I assumed that oh, it's she must have been very, you know large

78
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:11,859
Speaker 1: well that I guess that that's just because you asked a question that had a somewhat unanticipated answer

79
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,336
Speaker 0: Because I that was you know, sort of an obvious guess there.

80
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,040
Speaker 0: what was going on?

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the conductor is asking her and she really won't say anything.

82
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,139
Speaker 0: No, it's like it powers call Randy I got a million dollars.

83
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:26,290
Speaker 1: so then the conductor turns to the guy and says is she alright?

84
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,075
Speaker 1: and he says I don't know.

85
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,945
Speaker 1: uh-huh, so the conductor says Well, isn't she with you?

86
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,280
Speaker 1: and he says she ain't with me.

87
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:36,140
Speaker 0: Then why would you say in mind your business?

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,703
Speaker 1: So, uh, he said.

89
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:45,711
Speaker 1: so the conductor who obviously had already known about this situation and was just waiting for the opportunity to deal with Says well you gave me your ticket.

90
00:05:46,514 --> 00:06:02,078
Speaker 1: and he says he says well She's apparently with all these other people because these all these other people care about my business And they should mind their business To which the conductor says Sir what's going on?

91
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:07,497
Speaker 1: And then he proceeds to balk and deny and refuse to answer anything.

92
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:10,869
Speaker 1: and then conductor is Obviously getting very close to calling the police.

93
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,899
Speaker 0: if he's not already I would have had the police already called.

94
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:23,319
Speaker 0: Plus the conductor is very see unlike, you know me right where you know, if I'm on a train I can sort of try to deal with a situation like that.

95
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:28,900
Speaker 0: But the conductor has special law protections that allow him to be an asshole.

96
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:38,760
Speaker 1: I'll say this if you don't know if you're in New York State And you'd do anything to a transit official if you a bus driver, I don't know if it applies to cab drivers.

97
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,473
Speaker 0: I think this is different laws for cab drivers like mass transit.

98
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:48,124
Speaker 0: anyone a subway Employee a bus driver any a train conductor They're protected.

99
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:51,160
Speaker 0: you even touch them you go to jail for like seven years.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,996
Speaker 1: Basically touching one of them is the same as touching a police officer with the exact same penalties.

101
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,080
Speaker 0: It's almost as bad.

102
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:59,627
Speaker 0: It's pretty bad, yeah, but I mean it's it's.

103
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,900
Speaker 0: it's almost as bad not quite the same but there's a minimum sentences.

104
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:16,600
Speaker 0: Yes, there are very large ones I mean like if I if I'm walking down New York City Street, right and there's a cop standing there and I punch rim in The face right I would get like, you know assault battery something, you know night in jail something like that.

105
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,420
Speaker 0: Right if rim happened to be a train conductor I would be like a felony and seven years something ridiculous like that.

106
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,553
Speaker 0: Maybe I think there's like tens of thousands of dollars in fines.

107
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,020
Speaker 0: You don't fuck with those people.

108
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:31,753
Speaker 1: so anyway, the conductor eventually gets out the story and the work.

109
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:32,857
Speaker 1: the girl starts talking.

110
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:40,580
Speaker 1: finally and Basically, the two of them were at a hospital in Poughkeepsie and she is pregnant and there are complications.

111
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:53,746
Speaker 1: So they were told to go to a specialty hospital in Harlem Mm-hmm, so they had gotten on the train and they were told that you know just get on the train get to that hospital and they'll take care of you there and The situation like.

112
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,500
Speaker 1: they verified everything and it was totally normal.

113
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:02,818
Speaker 1: The only problem was that the dude was just a complete jackass for absolutely no reason.

114
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,504
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's like.

115
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,360
Speaker 0: did he want to create suspicion into thinking that something was going on?

116
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,900
Speaker 1: I mean, it's one thing to you know, tell people to mind their own business.

117
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,960
Speaker 1: It's in even though I think it was a stupid thing to do.

118
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,253
Speaker 1: It's an entirely other thing to lie to the conductor.

119
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,367
Speaker 1: when he comes and asks you if everything's all right It is obviously trying to help.

120
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean and why wouldn't the woman say anything?

121
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:31,560
Speaker 0: You know, I can understand not wanting to you know, share your situation with the world and have you know Some sort of privacy or something, but I mean, it's obvious that people didn't mean poorly.

122
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:43,818
Speaker 0: The people were concerned and if you you know, honestly did care you just you know, sort of say, you know You don't give all the details, but you would say, you know We're on our way to a hospital in Harlem the hospital in Poughkeepsie.

123
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:47,694
Speaker 0: He told us to go on the train and we'd be fine and that's what we're doing.

124
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:49,923
Speaker 1: if the guy had said it's okay She's with me.

125
00:08:49,943 --> 00:09:01,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would have been enough as long as she wasn't, you know, I don't know tied up or something I know right, but that And then you know, basically I just I was woken up by that.

126
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:18,340
Speaker 1: so I spent the rest of the train ride reading and playing advanced wars, but I got to overhear the conversations that went on throughout the train ride between the man and this woman and Neither one of them is the brightest Star in the sky the brightest bulb in the candelabra, shall we say?

127
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,380
Speaker 1: Yeah I Don't think their lives are going in a good direction.

128
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:25,909
Speaker 0: No, no, not really.

129
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,518
Speaker 0: Yeah now that is you'd like that.

130
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:34,160
Speaker 0: With an attitude like that, you know things that you might try to do you're going to fail at because people will you know?

131
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,020
Speaker 0: Your interactions with people will fail.

132
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:42,923
Speaker 1: Yeah I didn't get the end of the story because I moved out of the car to another car around Croton Harmon when she started vomiting All over the place.

133
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,067
Speaker 0: Oh, that's fantastic.

134
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:45,954
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the conductor took care of the rest of it.

135
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:47,680
Speaker 1: And yeah, yeah.

136
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:49,460
Speaker 1: So that was my morning.

137
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,031
Speaker 0: Yeah on the way into work.

138
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,399
Speaker 0: I played some dwarf fortress, right?

139
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,947
Speaker 0: I was doing the best your fortress ever.

140
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:56,509
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

141
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,051
Speaker 1: Is this II?

142
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,316
Speaker 1: but then the story.

143
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:04,119
Speaker 0: but then a Giant cave swallow ate three of my doors.

144
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,189
Speaker 1: So you were in that chasm weren't you?

145
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,052
Speaker 0: it just flew out.

146
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,800
Speaker 1: I'm excited about that chasm.

147
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,185
Speaker 1: I remember you're like I got a chasm.

148
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:14,880
Speaker 0: it actually happened when I got to work and I upgraded to a newer version of dwarf.

149
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,180
Speaker 0: I think that newer version had more monsters coming out of the chasm.

150
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:19,587
Speaker 0: I would think that was a mistake.

151
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:20,109
Speaker 0: to upgrade.

152
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,583
Speaker 1: you can see you build the hallway to the chasm Right.

153
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,480
Speaker 1: put some door on the end of that shit.

154
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:25,222
Speaker 0: No It did it.

155
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:28,474
Speaker 0: the guy was going because the platinum was in like next to the chasm.

156
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,823
Speaker 0: like you couldn't get the platinum without Exposing yourself.

157
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,032
Speaker 1: I guess you got to put some Rangers.

158
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:33,634
Speaker 1: just stand.

159
00:10:33,654 --> 00:10:35,180
Speaker 0: the Ranger got eaten by wolves.

160
00:10:36,243 --> 00:10:38,040
Speaker 1: Maybe you shouldn't send him out to kill the wolves.

161
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:40,707
Speaker 0: Killed so many wolves by himself.

162
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,414
Speaker 0: like I have a refuse pile full of wolf carcasses.

163
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,119
Speaker 0: yet somehow one wolf got him.

164
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,211
Speaker 1: Are you sure he wasn't bleeding continuously from all the fights with?

165
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,480
Speaker 0: if he was it didn't say it anywhere.

166
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,729
Speaker 0: It didn't say watch out your Rangers bleeding.

167
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,315
Speaker 0: tell him to come home and it's not like.

168
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 0: I could even tell him not to go hunt.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,004
Speaker 0: Well, he did it on his own.

170
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:57,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

171
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just.

172
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,211
Speaker 1: I'm saying you got it.

173
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,258
Speaker 1: The dwarves aren't the brightest.

174
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:08,968
Speaker 1: No shit All right, no, but I mean I was reading a story on the wiki about a dwarf who basically locked himself in his room and Starved to death.

175
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:14,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's happened And I tried to start a new game on the way home.

176
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,100
Speaker 0: But because I didn't have the wiki I couldn't get it the starting loadout, right?

177
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,467
Speaker 0: The game is very difficult to play or at least I can play it without the wiki But I can't start a new game without the wiki.

178
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:24,430
Speaker 0: That's very difficult.

179
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:35,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've yet to actually play a game of this though I'm kind of thinking I'm not going to join this succession game because I'm awful but I could foresee a Parallel universe.

180
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:37,439
Speaker 1: What if rim the dwarf took over?

181
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:43,997
Speaker 1: Because I imagine rim the dwarfs responses to everything are what the fuck do these dwarves want?

182
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:44,780
Speaker 1: they're out of food.

183
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,947
Speaker 1: I don't know what's going on.

184
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,073
Speaker 1: And now one of them's dead.

185
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,993
Speaker 0: once things are set up They will largely sort of work on their own.

186
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:51,000
Speaker 0: if things are set up, right?

187
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,642
Speaker 0: But it's it.

188
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:55,677
Speaker 0: the part is getting it to that point and then not having any problems.

189
00:11:55,758 --> 00:12:03,911
Speaker 1: I'll be honest I feel like I mean it was really cool interviewing the the lead developer for dwarf fortress But I feel like unless he open-sources this thing.

190
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:13,096
Speaker 0: It's never really gonna get much further than it is now I feel like it'll make progress But I think there are a lot that it basically won't achieve anywhere near its full potential.

191
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:17,992
Speaker 1: unless he does something different I think the game would be ten times better within a year pretty much from the day.

192
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:19,337
Speaker 1: It was open source pretty much.

193
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:22,584
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway On Amazon.

194
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,432
Speaker 0: I finally ordered a Leatherman cuz.

195
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,280
Speaker 0: I you know, I've always wanted one of those multi-tools.

196
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,780
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean I had I had a wood man and an Iron Man and they didn't quite cut it now.

197
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,258
Speaker 0: And they had so many different choices, you know, and like I was I don't know which one I wanted.

198
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,815
Speaker 0: Right the Leatherman wave is the most popular but I mean that thing is a fucking saw in it.

199
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:38,758
Speaker 0: I don't need a saw.

200
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,843
Speaker 1: What if you're?

201
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:43,860
Speaker 1: what if you get a saw something, you know, watch watch we're gonna get to Katsu Kan, right?

202
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,140
Speaker 0: You'll have your brand new Leatherman and there'll be a tiny piece of wood and we will just need to cut it really bad.

203
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,840
Speaker 1: We'll be about to get the rampart cartridges into the room, right?

204
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:09,614
Speaker 1: but there's a little piece of wood stuck in the door and the door is just too small to get it in as a result and The con chair is gonna come in and say But no Katsu Kan is canceled go home right that might happen they could.

205
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:11,740
Speaker 1: then we'll play some tiny poker right now.

206
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:19,963
Speaker 0: So I finally figured I looked at all the options and I weighed them against each other and I figured out one that has Most of the tools I need and not so many tools I don't need.

207
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:32,400
Speaker 0: and I realize these things are real expensive like they're 50 bucks at the store 60/70 on Amazon 30 30 bucks, you know I noticed this today when I was thinking like I need all this stuff.

208
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,070
Speaker 1: I was thinking and I sat down it.

209
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,683
Speaker 1: All right, what's everything I need Other than you know?

210
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,852
Speaker 1: large capital purchases like houses and a new car?

211
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,299
Speaker 1: and I looked at everything I needed and I thought huh?

212
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,278
Speaker 1: I wonder how much of this I can get on Amazon right now.

213
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:49,514
Speaker 1: Went to Amazon everything.

214
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,983
Speaker 1: I got everything I even could.

215
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:56,566
Speaker 1: I was sitting there and I was like I was trying to think of anything else I could need cuz I could Just order it right then.

216
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,499
Speaker 1: I don't go to stores anymore Yep.

217
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:03,858
Speaker 0: So anyway, the one I ended up getting is the leatherman fuse.

218
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it has a nice ruler and stuff and scissor and a what.

219
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:19,840
Speaker 0: now anyway I ordered it and it sort of didn't show up, but I checked the tracking information and it I basically said, you know Check that, you know Accepted for delivery.

220
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:28,339
Speaker 0: But that was it and it said that for a very long time and usually, you know They estimate a delivery date and things, you know show up way before that date.

221
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,632
Speaker 0: Well, it got to that date and it didn't show up.

222
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:31,940
Speaker 0: So the next day I emailed Amazon.

223
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,582
Speaker 0: I was like, what do I do?

224
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,088
Speaker 0: They're like wait until February 6th.

225
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:35,653
Speaker 0: There is six was yesterday.

226
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,480
Speaker 0: the tracking information hasn't changed.

227
00:14:37,902 --> 00:14:39,046
Speaker 0: I said, I'm pretty confident.

228
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,031
Speaker 0: This is lost in the mail.

229
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,240
Speaker 0: So they said, okay, you want us to send you another one?

230
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:49,840
Speaker 0: I said yes No, so they just sent me another one for free with better shipping than before for free and we'll see if it shows up.

231
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:53,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's a Amazon lost in the mail.

232
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:54,220
Speaker 0: No worries.

233
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,340
Speaker 1: So, um in the news I have to talk about this a little bit.

234
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:06,104
Speaker 1: It's kind of it's related nominally to the important events of American politics that Scott doesn't care about but They do not call.

235
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:10,120
Speaker 1: a registry in the United States is not something I personally care about because I have a cell phone.

236
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:17,198
Speaker 1: they can't call me anyway, but Lot of people who haven't made the leap into the current century still have landlines.

237
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:23,889
Speaker 1: as a result They care about, you know being bothered every day by telemarketers And I would do if I had a landline.

238
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:27,886
Speaker 1: and we have the do not call registry Which basically is a list you can sign up for.

239
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:32,000
Speaker 1: that says all right telemarketers can't call you or they get fined out the ass.

240
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,946
Speaker 1: And it was a temporary bill.

241
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:38,600
Speaker 1: The news is that it has been made permanent by the Senate.

242
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:41,755
Speaker 1: So the do not call registry is here to stay.

243
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:49,218
Speaker 1: and even better they added something because a lot of people got calls from politicians, but they weren't actually the politicians.

244
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:53,620
Speaker 1: they were robots robots disguised as politicians.

245
00:15:54,443 --> 00:16:00,484
Speaker 1: It is now against the law to call people with political message with robot Huh?

246
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,400
Speaker 0: Well, isn't that most of the calls you got there that was indeed.

247
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,978
Speaker 1: However, those calls were illegal anyway, because they went to my cell phone.

248
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:13,544
Speaker 1: But they were also from fairly untraceable numbers and there's a good chance that they weren't actually from the candidates They claim to be from.

249
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:15,513
Speaker 1: but uh, don't get me started on that.

250
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:21,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a Real still a big problem in this country in the fact that everyone has cell phones yet.

251
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:29,060
Speaker 0: They haven't really Updated the country to deal with the fact that people have cell phones only and it's like they got to work on that.

252
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:29,760
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

253
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:39,040
Speaker 1: I mean other than when there's an election and I get a whole bunch of calls to my cell phone for like the two days before the election The country accommodates my cell phone usage a hundred percent.

254
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, how are we not?

255
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:42,060
Speaker 1: what's missing?

256
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,282
Speaker 0: I know a lot.

257
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,520
Speaker 0: it like a lot of places you'll go and it'd be like home phone cell phone.

258
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:47,303
Speaker 0: It's like alright.

259
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,991
Speaker 0: Listen, I fill in just cell phone.

260
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:49,573
Speaker 0: It doesn't work.

261
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,060
Speaker 0: You know people gotta well, you know what I do.

262
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:59,980
Speaker 1: I just fill in the home phone because my cell phone is my own right but then they'll spam that one because you know No, and then when one I've never had anyone spam it cable vision keeps calling me.

263
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,606
Speaker 1: Well tell him not to call you.

264
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,718
Speaker 1: I know but have you actually told him not to call you?

265
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:17,916
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, have you sent send them a certified postal letter and in its state that you do not want them to ever call you Unless it's a direct matter pertaining to your continuation of service and or billing.

266
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:18,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I mean.

267
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,419
Speaker 0: What that's what I want.

268
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:30,380
Speaker 1: well do that send them a certified letter and State in the letter that if they don't comply and they continue to call you after such and such period that you'll be forced to Bring legal action against them, but I don't want to bring legal action the pen.

269
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,826
Speaker 1: You know how fun that would be.

270
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:36,438
Speaker 0: I had to take a day off work to go to small claims court to get less money than I make in a day of work.

271
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you can only get like a thousand bucks from small claims course, right?

272
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,684
Speaker 1: It's silly fun though They can imagine.

273
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,487
Speaker 1: it's kind of like paint.

274
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,000
Speaker 1: you pay some money right and you get to have fun.

275
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:49,499
Speaker 0: I would love to go to court if I had more if I had a bunch of vacation days.

276
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,004
Speaker 1: sure I have never been able to.

277
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:57,650
Speaker 1: every time I've been summoned to a court for something the charges have always been dismissed and I've never Gotten a chance to actually state a case.

278
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,474
Speaker 0: All right.

287
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:27,020
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

288
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:34,124
Speaker 1: I'm just curious is the direction of this a lot more people are dying than we think or is the direction of this not as Many people are dying as we think?

289
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:39,847
Speaker 0: the direction of this is a lot less people a lot less Iraqi civilians died than according To this one study.

290
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:53,214
Speaker 0: There's a study That was hard I'm not you know, of course a lot of people have died in Iraq on all sides and it's terrible and you know No, even if the statistic was 10, it's horrible, right?

291
00:18:53,254 --> 00:19:15,558
Speaker 0: So I'm not downplaying the horribleness I don't want anyone to think that right but this article the reason it's so quality is because it shows you you know how someone can conduct a Scientific study not you know Randy or bullshit or anything and publish it in a somewhat trusted You know source and that you know published study will spread.

292
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:19,478
Speaker 0: and the idea You know the general idea of that published study will spread within.

293
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,770
Speaker 0: you know The the mindshare of the people and people will quote that study often and you know It'll basically create a fact.

294
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:36,544
Speaker 0: yet if the actual study was not Conducted according to strict scientific controls and and it just wasn't done properly I just I cut.

295
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:50,019
Speaker 1: I imagine I had a cut to you know, Family Guy style the statistician sitting at his computer and thinking how many people died in Iraq and Then he just pipes dev random into some sort of program.

296
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:58,772
Speaker 0: Well, you can read the story of actually how they got the numbers so incredibly wrong here, right But let me let me find this little part here that I can quote.

297
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,522
Speaker 0: Oh I lost it.

298
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:03,709
Speaker 1: Oh, well regardless.

299
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,675
Speaker 0: There was a one part.

300
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:06,177
Speaker 0: Oh, here it is.

301
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:10,209
Speaker 0: Uh, uh, uh Scrolling go go go go go.

302
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:10,831
Speaker 0: 100 animals an hour.

303
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,493
Speaker 1: I'm not editing.

304
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:13,159
Speaker 1: Nothing's coming out of this show.

305
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,293
Speaker 1: They're here in the dark side of geek nights that the continuity is broken.

306
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:18,955
Speaker 0: Okay.

307
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:23,114
Speaker 0: Okay ears He talks about some of the different figures that people came up with.

308
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:24,460
Speaker 0: right and here's one of them.

309
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:34,190
Speaker 0: He says critics found yet another figure that I thought of also after deciding to write this the u.s Battlefield ratio of wounded individuals to deaths is eight.

310
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:37,540
Speaker 0: is that is somewhere between eight and ten to one right?

311
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,339
Speaker 0: Assuming a ten to one ratio, right?

312
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,620
Speaker 0: There would have been six million wounded Iraqi civilians seeking medical care over three years or ten thousand wounded per day.

313
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:52,800
Speaker 0: No hospital or other source of data could reasonably have confirmed such figures.

314
00:20:54,226 --> 00:21:06,298
Speaker 0: you see so It's it's just a lot of people come up with these numbers and the numbers get published in some way and people believe the numbers And you got to really go and look and find out where the fuck those numbers came from.

315
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,681
Speaker 0: and you know Not I'm not commenting on the Iraq situation here I'm just.

316
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:14,717
Speaker 0: it's a really great example of how numbers can get just way out of control.

317
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:23,740
Speaker 0: and you know People are saying, you know 600,000 people died 600,000 civilians died in Iraq and that's probably a huge overestimation.

318
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,579
Speaker 0: It's probably much much less is is much closer to the truth.

319
00:21:29,402 --> 00:21:37,983
Speaker 1: So since my news was kind of lame because the only commentary I have other than that it happened was basically Advertisers suck it.

320
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:43,140
Speaker 1: I don't care about you, but I got a bit of a geek bite here real quick.

321
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,164
Speaker 1: I almost said geek backs.

322
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:47,095
Speaker 0: I Scott says the main bits gonna be like long here.

323
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:49,567
Speaker 0: You got a won't be that long I don't know could be long.

324
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:50,654
Speaker 1: We didn't do a show yesterday.

325
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:51,579
Speaker 1: I thought that about that.

326
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but we couldn't come up with anything to do.

327
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:57,584
Speaker 0: actually that we did a news in a main bit And they sucked ass.

328
00:21:57,624 --> 00:22:01,420
Speaker 1: the story of yesterday's show is thus Scott and I are sitting here tired.

329
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,227
Speaker 0: We're looking at me so tired.

330
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,140
Speaker 1: Well tired as in I want to get about my real business.

331
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:10,940
Speaker 1: You want to make the show and get done and eat some dinner and we're looking at anime news Network.

332
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:12,388
Speaker 1: Nothing happened.

333
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,523
Speaker 1: there was no news and we're like, alright Let's just do the show.

334
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:20,920
Speaker 1: and what we recorded was probably worse than even some of the beta episodes of geek nights.

335
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:22,107
Speaker 1: Halfway through my news.

336
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,060
Speaker 1: I was like, oh god fuck this.

337
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:26,052
Speaker 0: It was a pretty terrible on my news.

338
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:27,340
Speaker 0: and then rims news was even worse.

339
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,019
Speaker 1: My news was like the most epic fail I've ever had.

340
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:36,780
Speaker 1: I basically stated the news and then realized that I didn't have a single thing to say.

341
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:37,763
Speaker 1: Nothing.

342
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,516
Speaker 0: not even I was trying to sort of start something up on his news and all he was just.

343
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:42,339
Speaker 0: he was just going in.

344
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:45,094
Speaker 1: I was like and I was flailing.

345
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:48,224
Speaker 1: I was flailing Jerry But I want.

346
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:51,700
Speaker 1: I want because I'm reading this again and I think it's important and I talk about on Monday.

347
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,599
Speaker 1: But I'm pretty sure anyone who listens to Monday dedicatedly has already read this book.

348
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,356
Speaker 1: Cosmos by Carl Sagan is one of the most brilliant nonfiction works ever written.

349
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:03,017
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not.

350
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:03,940
Speaker 0: I thought it was a fiction.

351
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:05,670
Speaker 0: No, I don't know anything about.

352
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,641
Speaker 0: I just know who Carl Sagan is and that's a book He wrote.

353
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:13,660
Speaker 1: I was about to say you cannot be considered an erudite and well-read human being unless you have read Carl Sagan's cosmos.

354
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,990
Speaker 0: I haven't read any Carl Sagan ever in my whole life.

355
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:17,356
Speaker 0: I know who is though.

356
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:20,433
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way I read a large portions of.

357
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:21,580
Speaker 0: I know generally who he is.

358
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,835
Speaker 1: I know the about the author that cosmos When I was young on the recommendation of my family and teachers and all sorts of people.

359
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:31,538
Speaker 1: now when I say teachers I mean teachers after I got out of Catholic school.

360
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:42,053
Speaker 1: but Basically Carl Sagan's cosmos is a book that does nothing more than point out How absolutely amazing science is.

361
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:47,954
Speaker 1: now absolutely amazing it is the things we know about the universe and how staggering it is that we know these things.

362
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:53,055
Speaker 1: and even more staggering is the degree of certainty we can say we have about these things.

363
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,071
Speaker 1: and Unlike Richard Dawkins books.

364
00:23:57,091 --> 00:24:01,519
Speaker 1: I mean, I really like Richard Dawkins But he's he is a little abrasive when he writes about religion and that sort of thing.

365
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:05,060
Speaker 1: Carl Sagan this lives is pie.

366
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,910
Speaker 1: The way he writes is mellifluous.

367
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,893
Speaker 1: It's brilliant.

368
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,860
Speaker 1: He's such a good author.

369
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,756
Speaker 1: I cannot stress to you enough how great it is to read anything.

370
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:14,400
Speaker 1: He's ever read.

371
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:19,860
Speaker 1: I'm a Carl Sagan fanboy good God and I randomly started reading cosmos again.

372
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:24,497
Speaker 0: And I just want even when you have all these other things you to read here.

373
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,979
Speaker 1: see that's how you know Something's good like in the anime world.

374
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:30,797
Speaker 1: We know that cowboy bebop evangelicalian eska flown a try gun.

375
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:39,230
Speaker 1: these shows Utena are like the great shows because people will watch them Multiple times in lieu of watching new things.

376
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,775
Speaker 1: It's the same way with books.

377
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:42,480
Speaker 1: I'll read the prince of nothing again.

378
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,359
Speaker 1: I'll read Carl Sagan's cosmos again.

379
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:50,060
Speaker 1: Considering how many books I want to read that I haven't I can't think of a more glowing recommendation for me personally.

380
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,518
Speaker 1: If you have not read Carl Sagan's cosmos get it now.

381
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,900
Speaker 1: You can get it for like a dollar at every used bookstore in this country.

382
00:24:57,241 --> 00:24:58,929
Speaker 1: It's been translated into every language.

383
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:00,174
Speaker 1: I can think of good.

384
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,299
Speaker 1: God should you read this book?

385
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,189
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

386
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,936
Speaker 1: I don't know why I was reminded of this But I was looking at John's gonna be real happy.

387
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,665
Speaker 1: yes He is but I was.

388
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:23,660
Speaker 1: I was looking for a thing of the day yesterday in the show that we totally bailed on and I Was kind of I was coming up dry like I was with everything else.

389
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,779
Speaker 1: I kept beating that horse and pumping that well and no blood came out of that stone.

390
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:42,306
Speaker 1: So Suddenly I was looking around and I checked to see if my new episode of some anime was downloaded and I noticed in my incoming directory a Torrent I had downloaded and forgotten about.

391
00:25:42,907 --> 00:25:52,050
Speaker 1: this torrent was every single song ever made including almost every remix I think exists from a band that I had forgotten.

392
00:25:52,071 --> 00:26:02,739
Speaker 1: I really freaking liked a lot and Then I realized that a lot of people probably don't know this band exists Or you may have heard their music and not realized who they are or realize the extents of what they do.

393
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:11,494
Speaker 0: so uh Erotic E capital E hyphen capital R. O T I C erotic.

394
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,324
Speaker 1: do not Search for that on YouTube.

395
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:16,430
Speaker 1: YouTube does not handle the hyphen intelligently.

396
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:19,458
Speaker 1: you will not find erotic music videos.

397
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:25,203
Speaker 1: you will find erotic music videos yes, and Don't do it at work.

398
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,708
Speaker 1: Let me tell you this about.

399
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:34,460
Speaker 1: I was surprised at the number of music videos and Anime music videos set to horrible things.

400
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:39,476
Speaker 0: There is a big crossover between fans of Dance Dance Revolution and fans of anime.

401
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:48,552
Speaker 0: you see so Erotic was like the second most licensed music in If you take all the songs in DDR ever right.

402
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:50,900
Speaker 0: in any DDR mix and you group them by artist.

403
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:54,792
Speaker 0: Captain Jack is the number one most appearing far away.

404
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:57,260
Speaker 0: erotic is the number two most appearing yes?

405
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,571
Speaker 1: I learned about erotic from DDR.

406
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:03,285
Speaker 1: third mix yes, and Their songs?

407
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:03,686
Speaker 1: well here.

Speaker 1: I'll I'll play an example and see if you can.

409
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:07,817
Speaker 1: you can get the gist.

00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:13,500
Speaker 1: see if this is an exercise From the following what is this song about?

411

Speaker 1: That's right.

421
00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:25,070
Speaker 1: their songs are not just you know full of sexual innuendo.

422
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,410
Speaker 1: It's full of outright.

423
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:39,110
Speaker 1: It's a little bit of innuendo, but mostly just straight up like yeah, all right Yeah, and the best part is if you listen to all of their songs They pretty much actually tell a story.

424
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,624
Speaker 0: I mean all the songs that are on the same album in order.

425
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:42,810
Speaker 0: they tell this little story.

426
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,453
Speaker 1: I mean max shouldn't have sex with an egg with his eggs But he did so.

Speaker 1: Dick is out saving people.

429
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:56,850
Speaker 1: It's Now my thing of the day is pretty much just erotic the band in case you didn't know about them.

430
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,221
Speaker 1: So I'm going to link to some of their music videos.

431
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:02,053
Speaker 1: The music videos are not great, though I think the dr.

432
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:03,279
Speaker 1: Dick one is hilarious.

433
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,203
Speaker 0: They're pretty funny.

434
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:13,646
Speaker 1: Don't watch them at work Yeah or don't watch them if you're offended by a multitude of boobs not attached to women bouncing around and being ridden by like beanbags.

435
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:19,377
Speaker 0: if you think You know Sir makes a lot times ten.

436
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of like the the music video in the Beavis and Butthead movie.

437
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,318
Speaker 1: It's it's the similar to that style of music video.

438
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:30,270
Speaker 1: All right, and pretty much every music video they ever did is almost the same.

439
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:34,643
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day cuz we're main bit is sports related.

440
00:29:34,704 --> 00:29:36,770
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is also sports related.

441
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,535
Speaker 0: Here is some hockey's right.

442
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:40,460
Speaker 0: This guy's taking a penalty shot.

443
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,282
Speaker 0: He's going in.

444
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:47,198
Speaker 0: He's gonna try to score right but He's not looking where he's supposed to be looking.

445
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:50,229
Speaker 0: usually, you know, if you think about when you're playing basketball, right?

446
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:51,973
Speaker 0: You dribble the ball.

447
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:55,825
Speaker 0: you have to but if you are always looking at the ball,

448
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:57,550
Speaker 1: which I do because I suck at basketball

449
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:05,589
Speaker 0: I don't have to look at the ball But if you can't dribble without looking at the ball while you're dribbling Someone's gonna take the ball away from you because you won't see them coming.

450
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:09,138
Speaker 0: Apply that to hockey you get the picture.

451
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean imagine someone played soccer looking at their feet the whole time.

452
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,790
Speaker 1: Well, I've seen a lot of videos of football players who are looking at a ball and not looking at what's next to them.

453
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:24,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah No, but the greatest thing about this video is add the goalie does this little victory dance.

454
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,581
Speaker 0: I have seen a lot of hockey victory dances in my time.

455
00:30:29,082 --> 00:30:32,333
Speaker 0: that is in the top three for sure No doubt.

456
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:33,719
Speaker 1: I think that is one of the.

457
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:36,310
Speaker 1: I think that's in the top ten of victory dances ever.

458
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:44,570
Speaker 1: Oh Like in that to the the premature victory dance the Hannibal took after he took over the Roman countryside.

459
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:53,146
Speaker 0: All right, I'll but I be in the lower half of the top ten Yeah, but somewhere between seven and ten, but it might it might make it.

460
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:57,330
Speaker 1: I'd have to actually compile So intense and it involves multiple stages of action.

461
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:57,731
Speaker 1: It was.

462
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:02,907
Speaker 1: it's definitely a step up from the typical football spike the ball and run in midair.

463
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,316
Speaker 0: Whoo Yeah, it didn't.

464
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:08,850
Speaker 0: what it lacked though is the cleverness that many victory dances.

465
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:13,970
Speaker 1: I think it made up for the lack of cleverness almost entirely by the sheer guts that it

466
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:29,077
Speaker 0: yes, all right, so Basically, you know we do the geek nights here and I think we've said a thousand times that you can be a geek about anything Even though our show is about technology anime manga comics video games And everything.

467
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:38,884
Speaker 0: you can be a car you can be a geek about cars You meet geek about sports - yeah I mean, they're the traditional like geeky things like most of the things we talk about.

468
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:43,980
Speaker 1: but remember here at geek nights We decided and a lot of people use this definition though.

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,290
Speaker 1: I did hear that overseas in yonder Albion.

470
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,977
Speaker 1: They're kind of reversed in Australia.

471
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,444
Speaker 1: I heard it's that way too, but whatever.

472
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,693
Speaker 0: Yeah a geek to us They speak a different language.

473
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:57,088
Speaker 1: They say lift instead of elevated and they when they say pants they don't mean pants.

474
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,308
Speaker 0: That's right It's a different different.

475
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,990
Speaker 1: They don't go on vacation they go on holiday and then they get their zeds anyway.

476
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,976
Speaker 0: So our vocabulary does not apply.

477
00:32:05,016 --> 00:32:17,390
Speaker 1: the the American Heritage Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary do not refer to the same thing But to us a geek, you know, well, first of all, there's a normal and a person just a person default state.

478
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,143
Speaker 1: You know like nerds geeks dwarfs what all the different things you can call people.

479
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:28,350
Speaker 1: there's a person a little Venn diagram action And then all these things are subsets of person and one subset of person I would say is geek and another one is nerd.

480
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,538
Speaker 1: And I don't want to get into all the well.

481
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,650
Speaker 1: a dweeb is this but a dork is this but blah blah blah.

482
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:47,574
Speaker 1: but a geek is a normal person who just happens to have a a somewhat wider area of interest than an average person and independently of that has a couple or Maybe more.

483
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:52,370
Speaker 1: but I like if it's more than their Renaissance man, but a few extremely deep areas of interest.

484
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,013
Speaker 1: I mean look at us.

485
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:56,530
Speaker 1: we're super into podcasting and we're super into German board games.

486
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,903
Speaker 1: We're super into anime and we're kind of into sports and all these other things.

487
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:00,345
Speaker 1: We're geeks.

488
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:01,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see a lot of people.

489
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,110
Speaker 0: They're not really super into anything.

490
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:13,067
Speaker 0: You know like you can always tell because like you see like a retired person right like rims retired grandpa Right made it was super carpenter man, right?

491
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:19,806
Speaker 0: Yep Is a carpenter geek and my grandpa he was a mechanic his whole life, but when he retired.

492
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:33,335
Speaker 1: he was super Carpenter not Mechanic-ing but also with the golfing and other things, you know, yep So like the normal person has the sphere of influence the geek has these slightly water sphere of influence with some spikes Just shooting out of it.

493
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:35,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as you got a spike somewhere you're geek.

494
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:36,389
Speaker 1: now the nerd.

495
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:37,774
Speaker 0: No, we're done.

496
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:41,035
Speaker 1: But I just want to say a nerd is Instead of a sphere.

497
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:44,949
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a line going in one direction with nothing else.

498
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:52,715
Speaker 0: Alright, but anyway, so many geeky people who are usually interested in you know technology anime Board games and such.

499
00:33:52,976 --> 00:33:56,307
Speaker 0: they often look down on sports, especially like spectating sports.

500
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,035
Speaker 0: Like you see people Spectating NASCAR and you go.

501
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:00,660
Speaker 0: I don't like those people.

502
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:07,830
Speaker 0: or you see people like, you know sitting on their couch going Watching footballs with some beer you go and I like those people.

503
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,958
Speaker 0: Yeah Sort of a a cultural conflict of sorts.

504
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:12,623
Speaker 1: like you see that I think a good real.

505
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:16,016
Speaker 1: the best example of it is in high School and even in a lot of workplaces.

506
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:20,237
Speaker 1: you see that there's three kinds of people when it comes to say the Super Bowl Giants won.

507
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,529
Speaker 1: it's a pretty good example here.

508
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,208
Speaker 1: So you've got the normal people who just don't care like they they like it or they don't.

509
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:25,630
Speaker 1: they don't care.

510
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,469
Speaker 1: What other people think Super Bowl happened great?

511
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,850
Speaker 1: There's the people who care about the Super Bowl the sports geeks and the sports nerds and they care about it.

512
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,373
Speaker 1: That's their thing.

513
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,330
Speaker 1: and they're like, yeah the Super Bowl and they talk about it.

514
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,774
Speaker 1: You talk about things you're interested in.

515
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:41,969
Speaker 1: and then there's those people who make a point of saying Super Bowl is stupid.

516
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:43,304
Speaker 1: I hate the Super Bowl.

517
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:50,429
Speaker 1: It's a You stupid woo solo cup wave and beer drinking jock bastards and your stupid Super Bowl.

518
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:55,170
Speaker 1: That affects my life in ways that you can't even understand because they're not real and I'm just lonely.

519
00:34:56,292 --> 00:35:05,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, now see the thing is when it comes to the Super Bowl itself Like I'm not a big fan of like the you know beer and pretzels commercial watching Super Bowl culture.

520
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:11,910
Speaker 0: But the football itself, you know, it's a quality sport and it's worth paying attention to.

521
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,697
Speaker 0: you Might be.

522
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,656
Speaker 0: you know, a lot of people say Spectating sports is stupid.

523
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,792
Speaker 0: Just play them as if there's somehow, you know two Things.

524
00:35:19,832 --> 00:35:21,377
Speaker 0: you can't both do both at once.

525
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:24,728
Speaker 1: It's kind of like saying watching movies is stupid.

526
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,289
Speaker 1: Just make them.

527
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you can make and watch.

528
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,570
Speaker 0: there's no reason you can't do both.

529
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:34,724
Speaker 0: You know, there there is merit to playing sports and there is merit to watching sports.

530
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,830
Speaker 0: They are not mutually exclusive in any way.

531
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, we're not saying you have to like it.

532
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,868
Speaker 1: It's not like you have to like everything in the world.

533
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:44,400
Speaker 1: I mean I Don't particularly like watching curling.

534
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,750
Speaker 1: Yeah me or do I like doing curling?

535
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,572
Speaker 0: However, if someone says I don't like particularly like watching certain TV shows that are not sports, you know It's like you.

536
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:55,283
Speaker 0: people like some things and don't like other things.

537
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,170
Speaker 1: Yeah now I have my opinions about things.

538
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,069
Speaker 1: I mean for example World of Warcraft, I think everyone knows my opinion on.

539
00:36:01,073 --> 00:36:03,269
Speaker 1: But at the same time people are free to do whatever they want.

540
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think it's stupid, but I think it's stupid.

541
00:36:06,027 --> 00:36:06,329
Speaker 1: I don't go.

542
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:08,369
Speaker 1: well I guess I do go around telling people it's stupid.

543
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,617
Speaker 1: So that shoots that out of the water.

544
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,744
Speaker 1: but I digress do as I say not as I do

545
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:30,660
Speaker 0: but it basically I want to Try to you know cuz I actually you know some sports I care about and sometimes I don't and my level of caring sort of goes up and Down and I want to sort of try to explain it to people who may be anti sport Why there is merit to sports spectating or

546
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,208
Speaker 1: at least what the appeal is to people who care about it.

547
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:36,139
Speaker 1: I mean You all you geeks and nerds out there.

548
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,919
Speaker 1: you've been in this situation before where you meet someone you're like Yeah, anime and they're like what anime is stupid.

549
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,964
Speaker 1: No one should like anime.

550
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,350
Speaker 1: and then you try to explain No, anime is not stupid.

551
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:50,955
Speaker 1: You just got to watch cowboy Viva and and they give you all the reasons you should like anime or you give them all the Reasons that they should like anime.

552
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,410
Speaker 1: we're gonna do the same thing to you from the sports perspective, right?

553
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,655
Speaker 1: No, it's a taste your own medicine.

554
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:58,850
Speaker 0: All right, so people they like to be entertained, right?

555
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,530
Speaker 0: And what is the oldest way of entertaining people?

556
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:02,613
Speaker 1: Sex.

557
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,964
Speaker 0: Okay, the second oldest way of entertaining masturbation.

558
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:11,177
Speaker 0: That's the same as number one For some people right.

559
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:17,279
Speaker 0: the old the oldest way of entertaining people right is Hearing or telling stories, right?

560
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,750
Speaker 0: It's all about a good story right now Stories you read, you know, like you read your novels, right?

561
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:36,863
Speaker 0: It's a fictional story and you know because of human feelings in the way You know brains work you when you hear a story or you experience a story through some medium You are entertained in some way it can.

562
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:43,750
Speaker 0: it can affect your emotions Depending on how attached you are to the story and the quality of the story and how you relate to the story, etc.

563
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:51,110
Speaker 0: etc, right so Sports themselves, you know from a playing perspective is a is a physical competition.

564
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:51,311
Speaker 0: It's.

565
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:53,143
Speaker 0: it's no different than like playing a game, right?

566
00:37:53,163 --> 00:38:07,604
Speaker 0: You're trying to win a game But from a spectators perspective a sport or you know, especially like a professional sporting league is Sort of this space in which stories emerge almost like a role-playing game.

567
00:38:07,644 --> 00:38:14,830
Speaker 0: in many ways you create this system and People work within that system trying to achieve various goals.

568
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:28,178
Speaker 0: But anyone looking at that system from the outside or even in the you know, if you are on the inside But you take a meta view These stories emerge and those stories can often be Epic and amazing in many many ways.

569
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:36,950
Speaker 0: and the thing is not only can it generate these amazing stories But the stories are real the real people doing real things.

570
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,890
Speaker 0: It's not like a role-playing game where you pretend to create a crazy story.

571
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,419
Speaker 0: It's a real story.

572
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,692
Speaker 0: and the story, you know It.

573
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,703
Speaker 0: it the way it turns out.

574
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:51,244
Speaker 0: you're watching these games Live and the story you don't know what's gonna happen.

575
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:52,490
Speaker 0: No one knows what's gonna happen.

576
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:58,030
Speaker 0: It's up to real people to do something real that'll actually happens before your eyes.

577
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:01,690
Speaker 1: Live now that there are a lot of other aspects to this.

578
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,092
Speaker 1: I mean we.

579
00:39:02,253 --> 00:39:07,115
Speaker 1: there was a Ted that Scott talked about on Friday night party line a while ago about Synthesized happiness.

580
00:39:07,175 --> 00:39:10,709
Speaker 1: now mention rivalries and the drama and you know the things unfolding.

581
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:19,235
Speaker 1: Here's a real examples because talking about it in the kind of academic terms of well people want stories and people To care about this and that is good.

582
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:22,106
Speaker 1: But the visceral examples I think are what really it's like.

583
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:23,089
Speaker 1: drive the point home.

584
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:26,248
Speaker 1: So the old r.i.t I'm the r.i.t.

585
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:29,035
Speaker 1: Hockey Now well one there's also.

586
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:39,086
Speaker 1: I want to point out that for all you geeks who don't live in the northern or north eastern But also northwestern United States or Canada or the Nordic lands or Russia Russia.

587
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:42,221
Speaker 1: Well, sorry, I'm a pockner I don't know what this Russia thing I was talking about.

588
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:54,629
Speaker 1: But uh hockey is Extremely popular in many many many tech schools I mean RIT MIT Caltech even if they didn't always have the best hockey teams RIT being the exception having an awesome hockey team.

589
00:39:55,971 --> 00:39:58,750
Speaker 1: Nerds like hockey a lot and they always have in the north.

590
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,856
Speaker 1: so there are sports that nerds like.

591
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,943
Speaker 1: but aside from all that it's RIT.

592
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:16,490
Speaker 1: hockey is fun and we enjoy it, but there was a rivalry at RIT until recently when we basically Ascended and transcended the old ways and moved into the real like full-on division of the NCAA Division one.

593
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:19,450
Speaker 1: But we had a rivalry with the school Elmira.

594
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:21,757
Speaker 1: Elmira was some like crap.

595
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:29,999
Speaker 1: Oh school in the middle of nowhere like one of those little colleges as a backwater middle of the nowhere school Hicks, I Mean, I wouldn't malign it too much, but it's a school.

596
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,325
Speaker 0: I can malign it plenty.

597
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:34,676
Speaker 1: Well, well, all right I gotta put my hockey hat back on.

598
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:43,766
Speaker 1: Elmira was a hell basically where devil's incarnate rose Periodically to attempt to defeat the valiant tigers and epic copycock at combat.

599
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:44,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

600
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:51,490
Speaker 1: So games against Elmira weren't really that special because all myrias hockey team was pretty good, but they weren't that great.

601
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:56,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess preview, you know before we got there It was sort of like RIT and Elmira.

602
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:04,570
Speaker 0: But Elmira sort of got worse as the years went on and RIT got better and some other teams got better and other teams Like Newman were always terrible.

603
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:25,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, so as a result Normally if I just gone to a hockey game against Elmira It would have been an average hockey name would have been anything special and it would have been the same for the Elmira people when RIT went to play there, but just through the years this Rivalry kind of sprung up where both schools would think about the other school to two entities that have nothing to do with each other.

604
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:29,483
Speaker 1: There was no reason anyone from Elmira would even know anyone from RIT.

605
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,530
Speaker 1: most likely they're just they're so far apart.

606
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,072
Speaker 1: No one cared.

607
00:41:32,112 --> 00:41:46,372
Speaker 1: No, but because of this rivalry the two schools would really get into it and whenever there's a game at RIT pretty much everyone from Elmira would come to RIT fill the other half of the arena and all hell would break loose and Vice versa.

608
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:51,830
Speaker 1: every time the game was at Elmira and it became like this huge deal and it was super fun.

609
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,328
Speaker 1: It was like having a tiny little.

610
00:41:53,851 --> 00:42:00,630
Speaker 1: Imagine if you had an anime convention where half the people love cowboy bebop and half the people hated cowboy bebop and everyone knew that.

611
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:06,907
Speaker 0: No, oh Yeah, it's just people attach these these feelings to something.

612
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:09,557
Speaker 0: it's sort of like You know you have.

613
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:17,190
Speaker 0: if you go to let's say you go to see The Roman Colosseum right and there's two gladiators right and they fight each other.

614
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:20,550
Speaker 0: Well, okay, you're seeing two guys fight each other's pretty barbaric.

615
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:27,824
Speaker 0: It could even be like, you know unpleasant right, but you know Let's say one of those gladiators was your gladiator.

616
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:39,430
Speaker 0: you you paid for them Or gladiator gladiator, you know, that was your guy, you know Like just like when you play World of Warcraft and it's your avatar in there except the gladiator is your guy.

617
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,386
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

618
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:46,326
Speaker 0: So now suddenly you have a real investment in the results and you start to care about it.

619
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:53,230
Speaker 0: and when you care about something The what happens to that something now has the power to affect you in an emotional way.

620
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:57,344
Speaker 0: So the rivalry between RIT and Elmira isn't a physical thing.

621
00:42:57,384 --> 00:42:58,970
Speaker 0: It's a law of the universe or anything.

622
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,797
Speaker 1: It's not like they're fighting over territory.

623
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:04,070
Speaker 1: It's not like there's a cat point in between RIT and Elmira.

624
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:12,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we got some fat dude standing there, but because people attach this emotional, you know We don't like Elmira, but we do like RIT.

625
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:14,006
Speaker 0: Why is just the way it is?

626
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:26,358
Speaker 0: Because it makes it more fun and it creates this fun around watching what happens and when you score and you beat them With two seconds left on the clock You scream like crazy.

627
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:41,350
Speaker 1: I mean, it's very analogous to the soccer people or the football people in Europe where you could almost say that soccer has replaced warfare in Terms of like the expression of national pride and nationalism in Europe.

628
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:47,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much at least between the European countries, you know Yeah, and many other countries around the world as well.

629
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,482
Speaker 1: Just not the US and also beyond that It's I mean, you know go to an anime con right?

630
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:53,010
Speaker 1: I guess anime is easy example.

631
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,342
Speaker 1: But all right, you go to some sort of event.

632
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:56,930
Speaker 1: We've we've seen this a lot.

633
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,278
Speaker 1: we should do a show in the anime day on exactly how to do this, but you're you're.

634
00:44:00,478 --> 00:44:06,890
Speaker 1: you see an event and The person up on the front will yell or say something and the whole like it's not anything special.

635
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:09,657
Speaker 1: they said Final Fantasy or was it?

636
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:10,018
Speaker 1: was it?

637
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:11,984
Speaker 1: or whatever thing it is that will trigger people.

638
00:44:12,426 --> 00:44:18,323
Speaker 1: and if it was just one person there Like someone walked up to you and said hey Final Fantasy you'd probably go.

639
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:19,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about it?

640
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:26,783
Speaker 1: but if you're in a crowd and there's meaning you like, you know You're in a crowd of people who love Final Fantasy and some guy on stage yells.

641
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,710
Speaker 1: So how about that Final Fantasy?

642
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,928
Speaker 1: You're gonna get the crowd screaming back and making a big deal about it and having fun.

643
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:35,174
Speaker 1: Well Sports are the same thing.

644
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:48,470
Speaker 1: you get a bunch of people who you know are all there for one purpose and they're of a like Mind or of the exact opposite mind and it creates this kind of group experience much like watching a movie with a group of people And making fun of it and almost getting kicked out of the theater.

645
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:55,681
Speaker 0: Now the other good the great thing about sports is that you know, it's a physical thing It's the feats of strength.

646
00:44:55,782 --> 00:45:02,269
Speaker 0: It could be fast paced It could be slow paced right but in in as people on the field or they're trying to win a lot.

647
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:12,370
Speaker 0: You know they and you know Hopefully at least and in there trying to win they might do some crazy things or due to randomness crazy things can happen.

648
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,199
Speaker 0: I mean ice hockey is on ice.

649
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,822
Speaker 0: think about that, you know, you look at other sports like, you know They have the basketball with the trampolines and everyone looks at that like a gimmick.

650
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:24,156
Speaker 0: ice hockey is on ice People are on ice.

651
00:45:24,236 --> 00:45:29,469
Speaker 1: It doesn't get more gimmicky than that, you know, I just keep imagining baseball on ice and I think I'd enjoy it.

652
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

653
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,270
Speaker 0: It's like what's gimmicky?

654
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:39,370
Speaker 0: Everyone has to stand on something super slippery and they can fall down and hurt themselves with blades on their feet wielding spears.

655
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:48,419
Speaker 1: Yeah Most gimmicky sport there is yeah, and if you spare someone all that happens is you get two or four minutes in a little box Right.

656
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:58,250
Speaker 0: I Mean during the course of most sporting events, you know Crazy things might happen like just watch the Super Bowl and watch that Eli Manning play.

657
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:58,751
Speaker 0: Look at that.

658
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,617
Speaker 0: Look at look in slow motion.

659
00:46:00,717 --> 00:46:01,599
Speaker 0: What happened there?

660
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:03,485
Speaker 0: They tried to grab a guy.

661
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:07,336
Speaker 0: he somehow crazily Inexplicably got away.

662
00:46:07,357 --> 00:46:08,723
Speaker 0: He threw the ball.

663
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:13,105
Speaker 0: some guy caught it crazily in a crazy way, but he ended up with it.

664
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:21,923
Speaker 0: and It's just like wow, that's a physical thing that oh my god I'm not editing that out.

665
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:22,549
Speaker 1: We're live.

666
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:24,119
Speaker 1: Prepare for katsukan.

667
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,206
Speaker 0: Well, that's I fell on my face.

668
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:25,709
Speaker 0: That's great.

669
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,980
Speaker 0: You know crazy things happened and it's amazing.

670
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,168
Speaker 0: you watch these feats of strength that people achieve in while they are Striving towards a goal and you know you watch, you know, like owned videos on YouTube.

671
00:46:39,248 --> 00:46:45,469
Speaker 0: or you watch You know videos on YouTube like rims thing of the day yesterday doing pull-ups off of a you know, a crane or or?

672
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,820
Speaker 1: Sasuke aka ninja warrior.

673
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,544
Speaker 0: ninja warrior.

674
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,047
Speaker 0: Awesome.

675
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:49,550
Speaker 0: Awesome.

676
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:55,094
Speaker 1: Actually one of my favorite things and the only reason I don't do it anymore is that I have in fact seen I think every Episode of it.

677
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:57,810
Speaker 1: but the old American gladiators, I love that show.

678
00:46:57,971 --> 00:47:00,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder if the new one's any good, but I heard some are.

679
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,590
Speaker 0: I doubt I'm gonna be watching.

680
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:03,901
Speaker 1: I heard that some RIT alum was on it either.

681
00:47:03,962 --> 00:47:04,947
Speaker 1: I think it's a contestant.

682
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:05,550
Speaker 1: I heard he won.

683
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:07,500
Speaker 0: I gotta look into that like to look into that.

684
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:30,033
Speaker 0: but yeah, it is fun You know in a sports context or not to watch other humans achieve physical greatness or even non-physical greatness, so In watching a live sport there is always that excitement of you know They're in a tough situation or something needs to happen and then something crazy happens and you go Holy shit.

685
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:34,190
Speaker 0: that just not only does that make a great story, right?

686
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,924
Speaker 0: But you see live the human achieving something.

687
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:39,887
Speaker 0: it oh, it's amazing.

688
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:40,930
Speaker 0: It can be amazing.

689
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:42,397
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's not always amazing.

690
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,270
Speaker 1: and also I mean and a lot of the other hate is people.

691
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:46,499
Speaker 1: Oh people always look at.

692
00:47:46,519 --> 00:48:04,550
Speaker 1: there's almost the stereotype that jocks are into sports and nerds are into dungeons and dragons, but Hi, you know, I think that a lot of geeks and nerds out there really kind of Overestimate the difference between the football watching football nerd and and the D&D playing D&D nerd.

693
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:08,329
Speaker 1: Because if you look if you talk to a person who's really into football, right?

694
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:22,781
Speaker 1: now first talk to someone's really into Dungeons and Dragons and they're gonna tell you about the character who has a 17 strength and they're gonna debate the did the like the different finer points of controlling an orb of annihilation and Whether or not stone skin is an unbalanced spell.

695
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,950
Speaker 1: and well like that goes something something.

696
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:32,850
Speaker 1: Talk to some football nerds and they're gonna talk about the statistics of last year's team versus this year And this guy got traded to this guy.

697
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,660
Speaker 1: So I think the offense is gonna turn on this.

698
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:42,690
Speaker 0: turn on your local sports radio AM station right and listen to the people calling in and talking to the radio hosts and what these people are saying.

699
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:49,190
Speaker 1: Those are where all the sports nerds are and then go listen to like Wow radio or one of those podcasts about World of Warcraft.

700
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:49,812
Speaker 1: You know what?

701
00:48:50,515 --> 00:48:52,221
Speaker 1: They're talking the exact same way.

702
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:54,148
Speaker 1: They're just talking about Wow instead of football.

703
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:54,630
Speaker 1: Yep

704
00:48:55,191 --> 00:49:13,375
Speaker 0: I mean another thing is that you know, a lot of people right they I really believe that there are a lot of people in the world who are sort of built to like certain things and But they don't end up actually liking all the things that they would like simply because they don't.

705
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:22,050
Speaker 0: you know, either the it's too hard for them to get the Information necessary to realize they like it or they have some sort of prejudice against it, right?

706
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:26,528
Speaker 1: I think a good example is we've had some friends who swore up and down robot shows.

707
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:28,556
Speaker 1: suck I don't want to watch some stupid robot show.

708
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:38,934
Speaker 1: They're all stupid and then eventually we were able to convince them that hey Eska flown a and Evangeline arguably two of the greatest anime ever made Involve robots.

709
00:49:38,954 --> 00:49:40,881
Speaker 1: you might say they are robot shows.

710
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:42,467
Speaker 1: However, they're good.

711
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:43,330
Speaker 1: You will like them.

712
00:49:43,472 --> 00:49:44,991
Speaker 1: I guarantee you will like them you're.

713
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:53,373
Speaker 1: the only reason you think you won't like them is because you have this preconceived notion that all robot shows are like Ghekhi Ganga Mazinger Nothing.

714
00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:54,378
Speaker 1: Yep, granted.

715
00:49:54,399 --> 00:49:56,630
Speaker 1: You're allowed to like those shows too, but for an entirely different reason.

716
00:49:56,851 --> 00:50:03,493
Speaker 0: Yes, and you know a lot of people like they watch NASCAR right and they say oh, it's driving around a circle It sucks now.

717
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,522
Speaker 0: I'm not a big NASCAR fan.

718
00:50:05,562 --> 00:50:05,863
Speaker 0: I'm not.

719
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:07,289
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna defend it, you know.

720
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:13,937
Speaker 0: But what I will say is that net there is a lot more to NASCAR than people give it credit for.

721
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:25,150
Speaker 0: and the reason they just don't know is because they turn it on the TV and they see cars Driving around a circle and it really you have to be a geek about it or look into it to find out.

722
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:27,204
Speaker 0: Because the drama is not in.

723
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:31,610
Speaker 0: in many sports At least the drama is not in the obviously visible things.

724
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:35,310
Speaker 0: The drama is in the behind or slightly behind the scenes information.

725
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:42,487
Speaker 0: And if you don't follow the sport at least a little bit if you don't you know Listen to what the story is.

726
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:51,647
Speaker 0: You're just watching the physical events without the story behind it and you're not going to enjoy that no matter how great the sport is because the enjoyment is all about the story.

727
00:50:51,667 --> 00:51:05,659
Speaker 0: and like if you don't know who the racers are or what the relationship between them is or You know who has more points than who or how this points work or how the sport works or the rules of the game The drama is lost on you.

728
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:14,850
Speaker 0: I mean if you're watching a football game and You know, it's it's fourth and goal, you know And is like two seconds left in the game, right?

729
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:21,470
Speaker 0: If you don't realize what that means you're not gonna be in a suspenseful, you're not gonna be in suspense.

730
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:26,104
Speaker 0: You have to know a lot about sports to understand the same way.

731
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:26,546
Speaker 0: people.

732
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:38,618
Speaker 0: if someone's you know Comes over to your D&D game or your game of Puerto Rico or any of your you know Your World of Warcraft and you're running some you know Crazy thing fighting some giant boss or something right.

733
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:46,530
Speaker 0: somebody comes up and knows nothing about it is just gonna see the barest Visual, you know obvious things about what are going on.

734
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,660
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're clicking repeatedly on a box and your guys swinging.

735
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,174
Speaker 0: you think back and forth and there's a dragon moving around and you're Like no, don't you get.

736
00:51:54,775 --> 00:52:05,170
Speaker 0: but because they don't know the drama is lost and I think a lot of people who are looked out On sports don't you know bother because of maybe prejudice or other reasons to at least?

737
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:10,075
Speaker 0: Listen to the story or try to get information about the story So that the drama.

738
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:15,797
Speaker 0: this is no chance for them to like it because they don't even put the slightest effort into Discovering the story in the drama.

739
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:16,580
Speaker 1: now at the same time.

740
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,830
Speaker 1: We're not saying you have to like it.

741
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:20,435
Speaker 0: I don't like anything.

742
00:52:20,496 --> 00:52:21,519
Speaker 1: baseball is a good example.

743
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,864
Speaker 1: I understand baseball.

744
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:24,730
Speaker 1: I know about a lot of the drama going on.

745
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,957
Speaker 1: I understand the rules fully.

746
00:52:26,258 --> 00:52:31,801
Speaker 1: I can look at a baseball game and watch it and think all right Well this and this and this and I see where other people could get their drama from.

747
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:36,953
Speaker 1: I however find no drama in it and find it Incredibly boring.

748
00:52:36,973 --> 00:52:40,103
Speaker 1: then I cannot enjoy baseball unless I'm playing it.

749
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:43,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think another important thing It's not really related to mean like.

750
00:52:43,557 --> 00:52:49,410
Speaker 0: I don't like basketball, you know because you know Even though I understand basketball used to play basketball, right?

751
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:56,390
Speaker 0: It's the fact they're scoring so often that I find, you know, very little, you know, incredibly exciting situations.

752
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,390
Speaker 0: That's why a lot of people say, you know, basketball is only exciting in the last few seconds.

753
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:07,689
Speaker 0: Well, even then it's only exciting last few seconds If the game is really close and I really think that basketball would be better served by being just a five-minute game.

754
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:12,366
Speaker 0: Just play for five minutes and that's it and you know because you're scoring so often.

755
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:17,465
Speaker 1: or just uh Make the court twice as long and put the baskets ten feet higher.

756
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would be cool, too.

757
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:19,627
Speaker 0: I have no problem with that.

758
00:53:20,091 --> 00:53:26,691
Speaker 1: But at the same time I guess there's also the idea that if you're gonna really decide you don't like something you're gonna hate on It.

759
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:30,550
Speaker 1: you at least learn enough about it to explain your hate.

760
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:33,361
Speaker 1: I mean Scott and I don't like World of Warcraft at all.

761
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:37,365
Speaker 1: And if you ask us well, Raymond Scott What don't you like about World of Warcraft?

762
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:37,829
Speaker 1: I have a book.

763
00:53:38,373 --> 00:53:40,629
Speaker 1: I have a book ready to go just sitting on my tongue to come out.

764
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:43,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of people they'll say oh, why do you hate NASCAR?

765
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,970
Speaker 0: They say it's cars driving around a circle or even Wow, and that's all they can say.

766
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:47,472
Speaker 1: There's been.

767
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:54,960
Speaker 1: there's been a lot of people in conversations I've had who have agreed with me that yeah World of Warcraft is crap But they agree, but they don't have anything.

768
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,124
Speaker 1: they can't back that up.

769
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:58,130
Speaker 0: They'll just say yeah people get addicted to it.

770
00:53:58,431 --> 00:53:59,093
Speaker 0: It's not good.

771
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:00,558
Speaker 0: It's a waste of time and money.

772
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:03,267
Speaker 0: and I'm like, is that the best argument you've got?

773
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:10,321
Speaker 0: because if so I don't want you on my team, even though you agree with me It's kind of like getting the endorsement from the KKK when you're running for president.

774
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:11,224
Speaker 1: You're like, yeah.

775
00:54:11,304 --> 00:54:11,766
Speaker 1: Thanks.

776
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:12,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's great.

777
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:14,014
Speaker 0: It's like great you.

778
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:23,950
Speaker 0: that means you agree with me about something, you know, and even if I got to figure out what that is Even if it's something like states rights, which I'll say, okay, you know, but I don't watch you.

779
00:54:24,735 --> 00:54:26,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz your reasons for agreeing with me are not good.

780
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,801
Speaker 1: but there's another very important factor here and I see this a lot in.

781
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:33,820
Speaker 1: I actually saw many of our younger listeners and a lot of younger geeks and nerds out there.

782
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:40,090
Speaker 1: you're in school and The cool thing for smart kids to do is to be all down on gym class and to hate on sports.

783
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,113
Speaker 1: You know what?

784
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:44,443
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you right now as an uber geek.

785
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:49,242
Speaker 0: See and my high school is weird cuz Smart people were also letting.

786
00:54:49,484 --> 00:54:50,690
Speaker 1: my high school was also weird.

787
00:54:50,951 --> 00:55:04,324
Speaker 1: The band was much more popular than the football team and our band was popular But pretty much everyone on the football team and everyone in the band were all in the AP classes, too And like all the the so-called popular clique were all like that.

788
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:05,950
Speaker 1: honors valedictorian kids.

789
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:07,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was no see in.

790
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:10,370
Speaker 0: my class is basically people who did shit and people who didn't do anything.

791
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:13,429
Speaker 0: It wasn't people doing this versus people doing something different.

792
00:55:13,992 --> 00:55:18,350
Speaker 0: Is that the people who are doing things were usually smart and people were dumb usually didn't do anything?

793
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it seemed like the same people were doing everything.

794
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:26,270
Speaker 1: the kid who was the valedictorian Was also in the football team and also in the band and also the head.

795
00:55:26,814 --> 00:55:29,310
Speaker 0: So he played a bunch of football then got any unit switch uniform.

796
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,149
Speaker 0: Oh, you realize you're on the field and switch uniforms again when we marched at home games, right?

797
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:49,929
Speaker 1: We there would be like six people in the in the marching band lineup who marched in their football uniform and then as soon as we broke at the end of the show if Like the opening show and the the anthem and everything they ran over to the football team and then at halftime They ran back over to the band and marched in the show.

798
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:52,726
Speaker 0: Didn't they get a little tired?

799
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,837
Speaker 0: Yes Did your football team lose as a result?

800
00:55:55,178 --> 00:55:57,527
Speaker 1: our football team lost because no one gave a shit about it.

801
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:58,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, there you go.

802
00:55:58,312 --> 00:55:58,990
Speaker 1: I mean look at this way.

803
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,648
Speaker 1: We had a football games right the curve because we had a full like stadium in our high school and this crowd.

804
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:11,850
Speaker 1: the stands would be packed Halftime would come and after the band show pretty much everyone left and that no one was there to watch the rest of the game.

805
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,905
Speaker 0: That's one more thing about sports.

806
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:25,890
Speaker 0: Is that You know when you're an anime fan or a nerd right and you go to a convention or something and you go to the convention Because you know, it's it's a chance to be together with people of your same culture.

807
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:30,890
Speaker 0: It's like ah, I feel at home with these complete strangers who who I share something with.

808
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,630
Speaker 0: We have a common interest to come and bond.

809
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:43,530
Speaker 1: I mean as we've said geeks are kind of a global entity in that all of you listening to the show Probably have more in common with some geek in Norway and some geek in Japan and some geek in Hong Kong.

810
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:50,417
Speaker 1: Then you do with a lot of the people who live in very close proximity to you physically Right and sports are very similar.

811
00:56:50,457 --> 00:57:02,762
Speaker 0: when I go to like giant Stadium right to go see a game You're like high-five and all the people near you and you're all cheering and you're striking up Conversations about whether they should trade this player that player.

812
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,227
Speaker 0: you're walking through the.

813
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:05,715
Speaker 0: you know The parking lot.

814
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:08,030
Speaker 0: people are you know all tailgating sharing?

815
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,858
Speaker 1: Here's another benefit of liking sports.

816
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:21,256
Speaker 1: if you got you like anime cons, right Basically, every sporting event is like an anime con for sports geeks and there's live me depending on the sport There's a lot of them mean.

817
00:57:21,276 --> 00:57:23,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get season tickets to baseball.

818
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:27,130
Speaker 0: That's expensive But you're going to a lot of games a whole lot of games.

819
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:34,944
Speaker 1: But the point I was gonna make before about the kid the younger kids is that there's a lot of this hate on Sports and as a result a lot of kids don't like.

820
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:41,347
Speaker 1: they try to get out of gym classes They don't want to join sports teams and they say oh, well, I only care about the academics.

821
00:57:41,408 --> 00:57:42,110
Speaker 1: I don't need sports.

822
00:57:42,852 --> 00:57:48,830
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind very strongly that everyone who has the ability to should receive a well-rounded education.

823
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:55,470
Speaker 0: There is a lot of evidence a whole lot of evidence that suggests that you know kids who are there.

824
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:59,702
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's a strong correlation pot and most likely causation.

825
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:08,250
Speaker 0: people doing extra things like, you know Sports and or music and such do much better in the you know academic parts of the school.

826
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:08,831
Speaker 0: Yeah,

827
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,296
Speaker 1: but I think it's many

828
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:11,439
Speaker 0: studies supporting that

829
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:23,710
Speaker 1: peep and not just for sports, but with everything I think early schooling I mean up right up until the point where you have to decide What direction you're going in your life and what you're gonna specialize in or at least right up to the level of your raw?

830
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:27,221
Speaker 1: Physical mental ability and physical physical ability.

831
00:58:27,763 --> 00:58:41,665
Speaker 1: I think everyone should learn a lot of Shallow depth about as much as possible in order to give them a more well-rounded Life and a more well-rounded ability to exist in the world make intelligent decisions and live.

832
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:44,714
Speaker 1: people who specialize too much in any direction Too early.

833
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:47,649
Speaker 1: I think have a lot of problems in their lives later on.

834
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,661
Speaker 1: Exceptions to be made for savants and crazy geniuses.

835
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:52,323
Speaker 0: Yeah.

836
00:58:52,503 --> 00:58:58,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you're a normal dude, you're thinking I don't need to know any of that math or any of that that they're sports.

837
00:58:58,626 --> 00:58:59,490
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be a writer.

838
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:03,606
Speaker 1: You're probably not gonna be a good writer as a result unless you're some prodigy.

839
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:12,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, the classic Stereotyped nerd jock war I think is something that only exists in the minds of people who perpetrated like a second-order simulacra.

840
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:18,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly That's been on my mind lately with this whole anonymous thing.

841
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:21,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, so do you wanna join to say anything else about this?

842
00:59:25,877 --> 00:59:26,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

843

847
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:55,964
Speaker 1: Go to an RIT home hockey game and when you walk into the hockey arena You walk into the front doors.

848
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:56,650
Speaker 1: you paid your tickets.

849
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,569
Speaker 1: There's a press box in the luxury box above you.

850
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:07,410
Speaker 0: Go to your left go all the way above you as in on top of your heads Like you have to walk around to be able to see them and go back to the back left corner.

851
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:10,990
Speaker 1: There will be a bunch of people there many of them wearing orange shirts.

852
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,597
Speaker 1: some of them are loud and scary.

853
01:00:13,058 --> 01:00:19,703
Speaker 1: sit near them, but not among them and Just see what happens throughout the course of this hockey game.

854
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:24,707
Speaker 1: You'll there's a good chance You'll become a hockey fan or at least an RIT hockey fan.

855
01:00:24,888 --> 01:00:27,746
Speaker 0: Wow I see hockey plays a lot more games than he used to notice in d1.

856
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:30,965
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, that's the other thing RIT hockey, but they're not doing that.

857
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:31,649
Speaker 0: Well this year.

858
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,055
Speaker 1: Well that that's the thing.

859
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:36,728
Speaker 1: RIT hockey was a little different when we were there because we've told the story before.

860
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:41,295
Speaker 1: but briefly There used to be three divisions of college hockey One two and three.

861
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:49,830
Speaker 1: the lower the number the higher the skill the higher the stakes and like closer to real sports Or professional sports or people who will go on to be sports players.

862
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,282
Speaker 1: RIT was in division two and they were near the top of division two.

863
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:55,030
Speaker 1: They're one of the best teams in division two.

864
01:00:56,132 --> 01:01:04,050
Speaker 1: division two disappeared and Teams were a long time ago into either division one or division three based on certain criteria.

865
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:10,829
Speaker 1: The criteria did not involve how good they were necessarily but other things and the NCAA is crazy And you know what?

866
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:20,143
Speaker 1: there's a lot of stories and drama surrounding how the NCAA is crazy due to a fluke and The fact that RIT does not have a football team and probably never will again.

867
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:36,470
Speaker 1: after something that happened, I think in the late 60s RIT did not have enough sports teams to qualify for division one due to an obscure rule that is designed to prevent a school From putting all their money into one sport becoming the best in that and ignoring everything else.

868
01:01:36,691 --> 01:01:37,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of.

869
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:40,189
Speaker 0: there's a lot of sports NCAA craziness like that.

870
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,215
Speaker 1: So RIT was put in division three.

871
01:01:42,676 --> 01:01:50,646
Speaker 1: now when one of the best teams in division two now basically has to play against people who I'm better at hockey than a lot of these people.

872
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,010
Speaker 1: All right Personally, and that's not much of an exaggeration.

873
01:01:54,717 --> 01:02:00,600
Speaker 1: so as a result RIT kicked the ever-living crap out of people every game.

874
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,467
Speaker 1: They once beat a team a team known as Newman.

875
01:02:03,748 --> 01:02:09,957
Speaker 1: Hello Newman to zero In hockey.

876
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,445
Speaker 0: that that's like a that's a crazy.

877
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:12,450
Speaker 0: that's like a football score.

878
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:20,109
Speaker 1: It's like that Bugs Bunny cartoon where someone hits the ball in the baseball game and they just keep like cha-cha up and hitting a home run and cha-cha.

879
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:24,326
Speaker 1: The game was like that.

880
01:02:24,346 --> 01:02:26,433
Speaker 0: that was That was some game.

881
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:40,556
Speaker 1: So basically going to RIT hockey games was an exercise in well sadism counting And Elementary arithmetic and also just the ritual and the thing and like, you know Here's another good thing.

882
01:02:40,576 --> 01:02:43,470
Speaker 1: a lot of geeks and nerds are into the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

883
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:55,786
Speaker 1: You know that ritualized thing where everyone goes and they watch the movie and people act out and yell things at certain times And there's like this this half performance half ritual event that people do it.

884
01:02:56,288 --> 01:02:57,030
Speaker 1: It's super awesome.

885
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,270
Speaker 1: We should do a show about that sometime because I really dig that Rocky Horror action.

886
01:03:00,672 --> 01:03:05,210
Speaker 1: Sorry, but we should have someone on for that though Yeah, we should have someone who's more into that cultures.

887
01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:07,001
Speaker 0: I've only ever I like seen part of.

888
01:03:07,102 --> 01:03:11,990
Speaker 0: you know, I know they do this thing But I really you know, it's not my thing and I don't know all the things about it.

889
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:13,324
Speaker 1: I've been to it a few times.

890
01:03:13,405 --> 01:03:13,890
Speaker 1: I enjoy it.

891
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,629
Speaker 1: I do not know enough about the subculture to speak as an authority, but I enjoy what it is.

892
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:30,460
Speaker 1: I couldn't do a whole show on it, but The hockey games in colleges, especially at RIT, but MIT at a similar tradition are ritualized in that exact same way and It's it's incredibly fun.

893
01:03:30,842 --> 01:03:31,949
Speaker 1: I cannot stress this enough.

894
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:41,604
Speaker 1: We have so many friends who hated loud things and hated sports and hockey and we convinced him to go to RIT hockey games And they became hockey fans within about 15 minutes.

895
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:48,399
Speaker 0: There's one more thing I got to say that I think we'll end it right is that you know the the primary Entertainment and sports spectating.

896
01:03:48,439 --> 01:03:49,404
Speaker 0: is the story right?

897
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:53,261
Speaker 0: and you know You can get a lot of the story from the sports pages and whatever.

898
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:57,195
Speaker 0: but really a lot of the story Isn't something you can see.

899
01:03:57,495 --> 01:04:02,088
Speaker 0: watching the game itself watching the game itself is sort of like watching only the combat in D&D.

900
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:03,653
Speaker 1: Oh god.

901
01:04:03,995 --> 01:04:05,923
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it's quite that bad.

902
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:09,814
Speaker 0: Well, it's like watching only the fights in Naruto So watching Naruto.

903
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:22,490
Speaker 0: Yes, a lot of the story in sports is like it is semi fictional or Dramaticized and there are people who make a living as sports writers and they basically create this story.

904
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:26,848
Speaker 0: They make up new drama, you know on the sports pages in the paper and on.

905
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:28,693
Speaker 0: you know ESPN and other shows.

906
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:41,750
Speaker 0: and if you don't you know, at least slightly dip into you know, what sports writers are Creating their their art, you know, then you're gonna miss out on a lot of what's going on and then you know.
