1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,830
Speaker 0: It's Thursday October 8th 2020.

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,059
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:19,538
Speaker 0: tonight We are reviewing the 2020 movie vampires versus the Bronx.

4
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:21,653
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:36,215
Speaker 0: So, uh, we were gonna do a show on Tuesday on Star Wars portraits because like that's that's a game we have wanted to exist forever and it's about as good as I hoped it could be.

6
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,459
Speaker 0: like there's a lot to say.

7
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:44,516
Speaker 0: I There's a big review we want to do but couldn't do the review because I had a plumbing instant as you might have seen me tweet about.

8
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:56,723
Speaker 0: so basically Sunday night, we're doing our movie night with our friends to watch this movie that we're gonna review and toward the end of that movie A noise happens.

9
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:58,528
Speaker 0: There's a noise coming from what.

10
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,510
Speaker 1: what noise was it?

11
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:03,280
Speaker 0: sort of a burbling noise coming from the purple.

12
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:12,100
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, so go over and look and there is just sewer water coming up out of the drain like slowly filling the sink.

13
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:25,620
Speaker 1: So the only way that can happen is if there is a clog beneath but there is still something Landing on that clog water right coming from above because it can't come from below magically, right?

14
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,502
Speaker 1: Well, it there has to be.

15
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:27,566
Speaker 0: what can?

16
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:31,700
Speaker 0: that's why in some places, you know that whole thing about the basement toilets.

17
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:33,659
Speaker 0: That's what those basement toilets are for.

18
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:38,388
Speaker 0: So if the sewer just comes up it'll flood your basement instead of but the sewer.

19
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:45,190
Speaker 1: the sewer coming up means that the sewer itself is clogged and water is coming into The sewer hitting that clog and backing up right?

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, which can't happen.

21
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,640
Speaker 0: I've seen that happen.

22
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:49,125
Speaker 1: I've explained yeah, but it's not.

23
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:55,386
Speaker 1: but it's not water coming up right like from say the ocean Whatever the s at the end.

24
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,671
Speaker 0: Well, it's water coming up from water.

25
00:01:56,892 --> 00:02:04,060
Speaker 1: It's um, the water comes down From above gets stuck and it keeps coming and it fills up.

26
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,339
Speaker 0: So that was the case here.

27
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:14,339
Speaker 0: But it is possible for water to be pressurized from the sewer itself and fight its way back up Especially depending on the plumbing is with no no clog beneath it.

28
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:29,179
Speaker 0: Yes That happens in a lot of terrifying situations that are thankfully not relevant here then also are rare in places like New York City but are kind of common in More rural places and suburban places with old plug.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,440
Speaker 1: So the clog wasn't just in your sink because it was just in your sink.

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,879
Speaker 1: It would only come back up if you turned your water exactly.

31
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,144
Speaker 0: This wasn't like it was.

32
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:42,099
Speaker 0: I clog the sink and now I can't put water down and if I it's like

33
00:02:46,702 --> 00:03:02,178
Speaker 1: The clog is somewhere at the next level of plumbing and someone else has their water on and that water is hitting that clog and Filling up the pipe and coming out of your drain Because all the drains are connected which means other drains should also be having the same problem.

34
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:17,536
Speaker 0: Not right necessarily because Billis apartment buildings can sometimes have surprisingly complex plumbing systems and From the information I had it was very difficult to figure out where exactly the pipes go.

35
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:18,840
Speaker 0: who shares things?

36
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:31,573
Speaker 0: I have learned now that our apartment is the lowest point On the line where if there's a clog in that line Before beneath the second floor is like connection to that line.

37
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,100
Speaker 0: Our apartment will flood and no one else will.

38
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:38,260
Speaker 0: So basically there's always one point that is like that in any site, right?

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,136
Speaker 1: So you're the lowest on the totem pole of flooding in that it's here like yes.

40
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:45,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I Wasn't.

41
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,170
Speaker 1: it wasn't a building wide clog.

42
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,240
Speaker 1: It was probably someone on your floor.

43
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost definitely what has been happening?

44
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:55,200
Speaker 0: because this happened once at the beginning of quarantine.

45
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,132
Speaker 0: Remember when my dishwasher broke.

46
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,399
Speaker 0: what happened was one day.

47
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:19,345
Speaker 0: so when this I was thinking this is the same thing because I one day I was just like Fucking around in the kitchen and suddenly a bunch of what is clearly industrial drain cleaner comes up out of the sink Like it was acid drain cleaner like not that because when you buy a consumer drain cleaner it's usually a strong base like Drano, but Professional drain cleaner.

48
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:22,115
Speaker 0: you can get both kinds and there is a professional drain cleaner.

49
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:25,612
Speaker 0: That's basically just Hydrochloric acid mixed with some stuff.

50
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,400
Speaker 0: It was clearly that All right.

51
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:34,680
Speaker 0: So in that case someone else probably had a clog and probably tried to deal with it instead of calling the super.

52
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,428
Speaker 0: So it came up.

53
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,016
Speaker 0: our sink called the super.

54
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:38,779
Speaker 0: they dealt with it.

55
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:49,040
Speaker 0: That's what destroyed the impeller motor in our dishwasher and we didn't have a dishwasher for much of the early days of quarantine Which was fantastic because we were cooking more than we'd ever cooked in the decade of living here, but whatever.

56
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:54,383
Speaker 0: So soon as this happens, I call I go downstairs and I tell it that like hey like hey We need some help.

57
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,136
Speaker 0: waters coming up ends and the water just kept coming.

58
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:57,800
Speaker 0: It didn't stop.

59
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,487
Speaker 0: It was filling the dishwasher and the sink.

60
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,237
Speaker 1: they means that somebody didn't turn their like water off.

61
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,905
Speaker 1: Someone was running water Right above.

62
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:15,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and it was coming all the way down hitting the clog and then filling up the pie Basically anyone above us in the column that supports our kitchen.

63
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:19,000
Speaker 0: luckily the bathrooms are a separate system thankfully, so there's no problem.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,482
Speaker 1: That's good.

65
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:22,919
Speaker 0: Okay, anytime anyone use their sink at all our water level just rise.

66
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:29,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was no way to fix this because it's very hard to get emergency plumbers right now in New York because of the quarantine.

67
00:05:30,222 --> 00:05:37,869
Speaker 1: So you have to tell every single person don't use your kitchen water at all up and the building Said they were gonna do that, but they didn't.

68
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,180
Speaker 0: I also overheard when they were talking in Spanish.

69
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:48,342
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they have no way to shut off the hot water anywhere in the building because there are several broken valves Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,171
Speaker 0: That's just an interesting tidbit.

71
00:05:50,191 --> 00:06:03,995
Speaker 0: I'm gonna remember for the future, but basically what they ended up doing is giving us a shop vac and Emily stayed up all night like literally all night watching the sink cuz about every 15 minutes.

72
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:10,159
Speaker 0: we have to shop vac out the sink and Shop vac out the dishwasher to prevent our apartment from flooding roll.

73
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,936
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's some way that you can make some sort of a claim either.

74
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:14,880
Speaker 1: renters insurance?

75
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:24,920
Speaker 0: I could but I would have to sue the landlord and Do a bunch of stuff with lawyers that would cost me more than what I could get back because the most or just I could withhold.

76
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,686
Speaker 1: You got to sue.

77
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,640
Speaker 1: you could just talk to the landlord first.

78
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:31,136
Speaker 0: I have this landlord give a shit landlord basically said take it up with the super.

79
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:35,159
Speaker 0: so unless I sue them There's nothing they will ever do All right, well, yep.

80
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:39,315
Speaker 0: So, uh all night Emily is shot back in this thing because we can't just leave it.

81
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,588
Speaker 1: because if we ignore it the sinkers Well, then what do you do?

82
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,719
Speaker 1: in the shop vac fills up?

83
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,583
Speaker 1: And why do people?

84
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:49,860
Speaker 0: why are people running their water at night in their kitchen people if around 3 or 4 a.m They pretty much stopped running their water?

85
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:56,206
Speaker 0: And the only reason Emily had to stay up the rest of the night was just in case like couldn't risk that Can't risk that disaster.

86
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:05,160
Speaker 0: So every time we filled the shop vac, which was like every couple every two times this happened We'd roll it into the elevator and the night doorman knew about the situation.

87
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:12,713
Speaker 0: I was helping us out and he would go drain it in like the like the Industrial sinks in the building and send it back up the elevator for us.

88
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:24,711
Speaker 0: Why don't you just send it down the bathtub toilet, uh That actually would have been a giant pain because I would have had to run the shop vac in reverse or lift the Extremely heavy shop vac filled with water.

89
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,340
Speaker 1: You don't lift it you run in reverse.

90
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, running it in reverse who spews?

91
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,240
Speaker 0: because it's shot backs tend to leak a lot.

92
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,671
Speaker 1: I was not gonna get into a bet into a bathtub.

93
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that was not gonna fly.

94
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,352
Speaker 0: So we did this whole like shuttle operation.

95
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:42,560
Speaker 0: all night in the morning Emily fell asleep and I kept an eye on it for the next like five hours while I was trying to get work done.

96
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,500
Speaker 1: Well in the morning, it probably started going real.

97
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:45,524
Speaker 0: Oh, I was just.

98
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:51,900
Speaker 0: I was just shot back and constantly and at one point while I was waiting for the shop vac to come back I was bailing water into the bathtub with a bucket.

99
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,815
Speaker 0: So eventually around like noon the plumber at the emergency plumber actually shows up.

100
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:03,540
Speaker 1: and could you have Could you have right take the top off the shop vac?

101
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:14,089
Speaker 1: right and run a run a hose from the bottom of the shop vac to the bathtubs to carry a constant I We if this were my house, that is what I would have done.

102
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:25,731
Speaker 0: The building did not have any tubes long enough to do that like when you were kids like I remember we had floods like that in our house and we had like an industrial shop vac and We would do exactly what you described like that's.

103
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:40,544
Speaker 1: oh, we actually didn't have a shop vac but what we did have was we actually had a Water pump that you would use to fill or empty the pool the swimming pool Yeah And it's basically just a thing that floats in the pool and you attach a garden hose to it and a power cable to it And it pumps water out the hose.

104
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:46,425
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we are actually cheated with filling the pools because you know My dad was a fire could have put that.

105
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:51,208
Speaker 1: you could have put that in the sink with a garden hose running over to the Tub and just turn it on.

106
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,356
Speaker 0: my dad was a fireman.

107
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:57,640
Speaker 0: one time We filled our pool by just plugging in the fire hose and run it over to the pool and it filled the pool.

108
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:59,652
Speaker 1: That saves a lot of time.

109
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,060
Speaker 1: we did with the garden hose took forever.

110
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if we filled the pool in like an hour like done like yeah, it was amazing.

111
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:08,720
Speaker 0: That was probably super illegal, but whatever statute of limitations.

112
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,303
Speaker 0: Oh, is it?

113
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,740
Speaker 1: I assume from the bed is mean from the from the fire hydrant?

114
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,127
Speaker 0: Well one we didn't pay that water bill because there's no fire hydrant.

115
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:19,299
Speaker 0: and two that is definitely a misappropriation of civic infrastructure.

116
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course I repair.

117
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,679
Speaker 0: we had to paint that fire hydrant ourselves because it was on our property.

118
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:36,593
Speaker 0: so Anyway, so, uh, eventually the plumber comes and sends us and he explained to me the layout Like I know the layout now of the building and like where all the pipes go.

119
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,100
Speaker 0: cuz he's the plumbers pretty cool.

120
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:46,355
Speaker 0: so he sent like a 60-foot snake in there and fucked up some terrifying shit that he found in there.

121
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:53,387
Speaker 0: and Basically someone in our building just sucks and has clearly been putting things down there drain They shouldn't be and caused this problem.

122
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:54,612
Speaker 0: So he fixed it.

123
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,836
Speaker 0: The water is running fine.

124
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:58,985
Speaker 0: He leaves Late that night.

125
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,856
Speaker 0: the next night starts up again.

126
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:01,580
Speaker 0: same problem.

127
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:06,300
Speaker 0: Then they had to take our whole sink apart because they needed to use the longer snake.

128
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:11,600
Speaker 0: So they had to take apart like our sink the they had to take apart like they drilled a hole in our drain lines.

129
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,125
Speaker 1: Why do they have to take apart the sink?

130
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,253
Speaker 1: Can't they just go under the sink remove the.

131
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:25,618
Speaker 0: you know the thing and uh, I don't know if you do you know a lot about plumbing they had to remove the bit that is Inserted into the bottom of a sink that connects to the drain.

132
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:29,009
Speaker 0: that's actually like a separate bit in sinks like you screw it in.

133
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:47,208
Speaker 0: Anyway, he took all that apart because he had to get the snake in like the root of the pipes And he sent it even longer snake down and that fixed it again, and he was basically like yeah So if this ever happens again The problem is in the like basement infrastructure of the building and it's gonna be a big problem.

134
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,373
Speaker 0: and then he left Hmm.

135
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,689
Speaker 0: So that was my fun couple of days.

136
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:57,063
Speaker 1: It sounds like they actually it doesn't sound like a neighbor actually fucked up twice.

137
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,110
Speaker 1: It sounds like the clog was pushed deeper.

138
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:01,901
Speaker 1: Yeah, push and then claw and then clogged again.

139
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,110
Speaker 1: and now that has been pushed even deeper.

140
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:10,910
Speaker 1: It's now in a larger pipe and has been gone, but it could happen again if someone shoved something bad again.

141
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:18,361
Speaker 0: Yeah based on what was coming up out of the drain I think a lot of people just put coffee grounds down the drain like all of them.

142
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,106
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that's a big part of it.

143
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,550
Speaker 1: I Guess they could clog if they clump up, right?

144
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:30,170
Speaker 0: Like if they do it if someone is also pouring grease and fat down the drain which you're not supposed to do in quantity.

145
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:35,070
Speaker 0: Coffee grounds plus fat in quantity will definitely cause that problem.

146
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:45,810
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm based on plumbing knowledge that I have and having seen this on the fat bird pictures I've seen in the yeah My dad did a lot of like house contracting on the side when we were kids to pay bills.

147
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,777
Speaker 0: So, uh, I helped with some of that sometimes.

148
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:51,430
Speaker 1: and why don't you just buy like a giant snake on the internet?

149
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:52,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, where the hell am I gonna put that?

150
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,549
Speaker 0: also those are very expensive, especially the powered ones.

151
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,818
Speaker 1: You'll make up for it getting in the plumbing business.

152
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:01,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could.

153
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:05,506
Speaker 0: I do not want to be in the plumbing business though smelly.

154
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:08,279
Speaker 0: Imagine if this clog had been in the.

155
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,470
Speaker 1: you'd be you'd be it but you'd be a one-note plumber.

156
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,313
Speaker 1: All you do is snake.

157
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:11,976
Speaker 1: You don't do anything.

158
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:12,960
Speaker 1: That's called roto-ruder.

159
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,065
Speaker 0: You can just call roto-ruder.

160
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,290
Speaker 0: Those guys don't get paid that much.

161
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,508
Speaker 0: So, yeah got some news.

162
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:22,473
Speaker 1: Do I have news?

163
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,918
Speaker 0: I forget the NHL draft.

164
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:25,143
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

165
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:25,424
Speaker 1: Sure.

166
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the NHL draft happened.

167
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,389
Speaker 1: It was obviously weird because under normal circumstances you would be just playing hockey by October 8th 7th, whatever day.

168
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:42,238
Speaker 1: You know as I think we discussed previously the Rangers won the twelve and a half percent lottery And had the first pick.

169
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,049
Speaker 1: they picked the best player.

170
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,109
Speaker 1: It's no surprise to anybody.

171
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:56,215
Speaker 1: It was interesting because you know, this is the first time they weren't able to hold it in a large Place everyone together.

172
00:12:56,316 --> 00:13:05,770
Speaker 1: So, you know the different teams that to communicate with each other via, you know digital means The players had to celebrate in their homes, right?

173
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,210
Speaker 1: Like, you know, they're just sitting there with a camera pointed at him so people can see their reaction or whatever.

174
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,998
Speaker 1: You know, it was a weird one.

175
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:21,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I ended up just watching a Twitter feed Anna Fark thread that had like the updates plus your commentary and a few other people's commentary in the discords.

176
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:27,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think somebody called it like a. they had that they.

177
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:28,647
Speaker 1: what did they call it?

178
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:31,609
Speaker 0: And I've seen people call it the baby auction.

179
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was basically like a child.

180
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:36,979
Speaker 1: So this is something along those lines.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,236
Speaker 0: The only thing I cared about was the Rangers One that we won that had that winning lottery ticket from the draft lottery number one overall pick I'll take it not really deserve because the Rangers are actually a pretty good team During their rebuild.

182
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:53,050
Speaker 1: but listen, you got to prevent people from tanking, right?

183
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:54,389
Speaker 1: That is to you know.

184
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,156
Speaker 1: And it worked out the lottery in the first place.

185
00:13:56,176 --> 00:14:00,171
Speaker 1: the best-case scenario and elder instead is giving it to Detroit the worst team Right.

186
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if we did it in the perfect world, yeah the Detroit and like Buffalo would have gotten like all the good kids.

187
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:10,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially in a year like this where you have one player who's just ridiculously good, right?

188
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:14,082
Speaker 1: It's like yeah Yeah, I'll see Loughren yay, whatever.

189
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,810
Speaker 0: Yeah But we won that lottery had the winning lottery ticket.

190
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:24,763
Speaker 0: So the only thing the Rangers did first is cash in that lottery ticket and get that kid and all they have to do Is not break him.

191
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,674
Speaker 0: Just don't hurt that.

192
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:30,849
Speaker 1: I think the the most interesting thing was what the Commissioner said at the start.

193
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,695
Speaker 1: They plan to.

194
00:14:33,477 --> 00:14:38,170
Speaker 1: their current plan is to somehow start an NHL season on January 1st, and I'm like really?

195
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:39,909
Speaker 1: How are you gonna do that?

196
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:51,890
Speaker 0: I don't think there's gonna be a 2021 NHL season because the playoffs only worked because they made this Isolated bubble and only a few teams had to be there and as time went on fewer and fewer teams had to be there.

197
00:14:52,992 --> 00:15:00,770
Speaker 0: They like like a really complicated schedule of like Right group teams together get a bunch of games in group a different set together like it'd be a weird schedule.

198
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:05,890
Speaker 1: So my prediction for the bubble was that they would start it and not finish it and I was wrong.

199
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,834
Speaker 1: They've finished it.

200
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:13,947
Speaker 1: so my prediction now would be just what you said It's just not gonna happen, but I think we're gonna have to plus one.

201
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:14,349
Speaker 1: it right.

202
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:19,249
Speaker 1: so I think that now the adjusted prediction is this time they're gonna start and not finish.

203
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,808
Speaker 0: Yeah I think this one's much more.

204
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:28,770
Speaker 0: There are a lot more vectors of the season does not continue when it's every team as opposed to a few teams.

205
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what's gonna be with that.

206
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:33,596
Speaker 1: You know, some people are really confident.

207
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:34,318
Speaker 1: someone was.

208
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:38,810
Speaker 1: I was like I tried to ask like hey, what's the ticket situation gonna be?

209
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,325
Speaker 1: How about you just write it, right?

210
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,126
Speaker 1: When is there gonna be a game I can actually go to?

211
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,961
Speaker 0: Cuz yeah, cuz ever that my biggest fear is if they had if they if New York opens up to where there will be games But it's too early next year.

212
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:53,572
Speaker 0: I don't know if I trust going Right.

213
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:57,630
Speaker 1: It's like I'm very determined to be like listen the first game that they allow anyone to go to.

214
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,790
Speaker 1: I want to be there right because that would be a big-time deal, right?

215
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:01,487
Speaker 1: It's like, you know.

216
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:08,406
Speaker 1: But at the same time if they decide to be stupid and have a game and let people come when it's not safe to come I ain't gonna go.

217
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,157
Speaker 1: That's ridiculous.

218
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:11,860
Speaker 1: Why would I do that?

219
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,845
Speaker 0: Well, there's that I saw.

220
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:13,750
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of stuff.

221
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:14,858
Speaker 0: I was saying the same thing.

222
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:26,460
Speaker 0: people's behavior is In that situation across the board like if restaurants or like theaters or anything open is tied directly to whether or not they're Republican Or a Democrat in the United States and generally.

223
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,109
Speaker 1: but like what if they take my money and like here's tickets And I'm like, I'd have to sell them I guess to someone who's willing to go.

224
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,233
Speaker 1: But that feels good.

225
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:38,266
Speaker 0: scalping tickets during kovat that is like selling the jib the the devil bottle.

226
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:39,870
Speaker 1: I'm not willing to.

227
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,954
Speaker 0: Maybe It's basically.

228
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,843
Speaker 0: the story is very simply.

229
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,270
Speaker 0: you've got this bottle.

230
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:55,747
Speaker 0: It gives you fantastic powers But if you die while you still own it you go to hell in the bottle forever.

231
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:56,529
Speaker 0: There's no way out.

232
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,989
Speaker 0: All right, you can only sell it for less than you paid for it.

233
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:04,364
Speaker 0: At some point someone's fucked by this bottle.

234
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:11,310
Speaker 0: if you sell it You have the plausible deniability of well the person I sold it to might sell it to someone else before they die.

235
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:17,805
Speaker 0: But at some point there is a smallest amount of currency at which time somebody goes to hell.

236
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,669
Speaker 0: how culpable somebody you.

237
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:28,089
Speaker 1: well, I think what would happen in this case is that unlike the devil bottle right is I would sell it for close to what it cost.

238
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:40,766
Speaker 1: You know the next person if they decide they don't want to take the risk they sell it for right and then eventually You know It's like everyone along the line is Recouping most of their money and somewhat towards the end of the line is like paying a penny and not use.

239
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,770
Speaker 1: just not using the ticket.

240
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,115
Speaker 1: They're not going to hell.

241
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:44,059
Speaker 1: They're just basically.

242
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,665
Speaker 0: I feel like someone will use the ticket though.

243
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,729
Speaker 0: I feel like someone will go.

244
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,134
Speaker 1: Well, that's there.

245
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:49,038
Speaker 1: That's right.

246
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,584
Speaker 0: If we just don't get tickets at all.

247
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:58,110
Speaker 0: This tickets are still gonna get sold Though maybe they won't because that partisan thing the the study showed very clearly.

248
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:05,710
Speaker 0: People like Democrats like most people live in New York Won't go to things no matter what the law is if the law says restaurants are open.

249
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,802
Speaker 0: Most people here will not actually go to them.

250
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:14,443
Speaker 0: some well, but most won't Yep, but in other states like people will go no matter what like.

251
00:18:14,463 --> 00:18:16,007
Speaker 0: they'll even try to go if they're not allowed to.

252
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:18,810
Speaker 1: We'll see what happened.

253
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:19,188
Speaker 0: Yep.

254
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,276
Speaker 0: Some other news from my home state.

255
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:25,087
Speaker 0: if you're not aware the state of Michigan is known for a few things.

256
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,690
Speaker 0: their state animal is the Wolverine.

257
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:33,830
Speaker 0: Michigan is the only state outside of the Civil War to go to it to go to war with another states.

258
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,315
Speaker 0: It had a war with Ohio.

259
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,699
Speaker 0: That was just stupid all around.

260
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:39,870
Speaker 0: It's the only state that ever tried to invade a foreign country.

261
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:48,646
Speaker 0: Michigan tried to invade Canada once because Michigan and The northern part of Michigan is filled with militia nutjobs.

262
00:18:48,707 --> 00:19:01,310
Speaker 0: now in the rest of the country There are militia nutjobs, but the Michigan militias are way more dangerous Way heavier armed and way less subject to the scrutiny of the law for a lot of reasons.

263
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,818
Speaker 0: Like they're dangerous to law enforcement.

264
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:04,861
Speaker 0: They're dangerous to everybody.

265
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:05,222
Speaker 0: They're just.

266
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:06,105
Speaker 1: it's really.

267
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:07,790
Speaker 1: it's a geographical thing, right?

268
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,998
Speaker 1: It's like you look at Michigan.

269
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:17,878
Speaker 0: You got this hand-shaped kind of thing Up in the top of the fingers that is like Right hills and mining and shit Right like way up towards.

270
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,889
Speaker 1: that goes like if you don't know Detroit is like in the bottom, right?

271
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,614
Speaker 1: It's it's way down.

272
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:26,649
Speaker 0: almost the entire economy and population of Michigan is in the southeast bottom little corner.

273
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:29,028
Speaker 0: The whole rest of it is just Hicks, right?

274
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go to the top right in between Michigan Lake Michigan and Lake Huron right at that pointy part, you know and Parts south of that.

275
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:38,490
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just the middle of nowhere.

276
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:40,914
Speaker 1: You know, it's not really.

277
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:44,344
Speaker 1: you look at a Google satellite view and you'll see it's just green.

278
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:46,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a huge state.

279
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,844
Speaker 0: But and there's that whole other bit that we in that war with Ohio.

280
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,390
Speaker 0: That's why we won that bit in the top.

281
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,072
Speaker 0: They took it from Wisconsin gave it to us Right here.

282
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,497
Speaker 1: Let's let's zoom in on that area.

283
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:58,204
Speaker 1: See what kind of towns we can find.

284
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,910

00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:02,469
Speaker 0: Actually Petoskey is a really fun place to go.

288
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:16,308
Speaker 1: It has a movie theater and a Home Depot and a Walmart and a Lowe's Petoskey Applebee's Mackinaw and a Buffalo Wild Wing Island Traverse City, basically everything along the coast is also cool.

289
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,785
Speaker 0: It's when you get into that middle part or when you get into the middle part or okay.

290
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, Petoskey was on the water.

296
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:40,550
Speaker 0: Yeah Now look now church got zoom in will go up to that upper peninsula and just zoom in like somewhere in the middle of it.

297
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:47,159
Speaker 0: there's like in the Squares of roads and like mountains and copper mines.

298
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,866
Speaker 1: I see Gwynn Gwynn UP.

299
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:50,227
Speaker 1: What are they?

300
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:54,973
Speaker 1: No new Swansea Larry's family.

301
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:57,062
Speaker 0: just funny the Petoskey is the first place you mentioned.

302
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,690
Speaker 0: Petoskey just happens to be super awesome.

303
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:00,159
Speaker 1: It was on the coast.

304
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,428
Speaker 1: That's why it stood out here.

305
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,569
Speaker 0: But yeah, basically the Michigan militias a car wash.

306
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,109
Speaker 1: There's a car wash a lot of reasons in a dollar store super dangerous and organized and big.

307
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:21,015
Speaker 0: They one of them just legit like had a plan to kidnap the governor of the state and try to stage a coup Like an organized one they arrested.

308
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:27,633
Speaker 1: thing is even if you do successfully kidnap the governor of the state that does not create a coup Situation.

309
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:32,610
Speaker 1: well that cuz that's the thing the lieutenant governor would presumably take over or whatever Michigan has.

310
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:38,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, I feel like at the point where a militia has kidnapped the governor of a state.

311
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:42,080
Speaker 0: I Think the National Guard shows up.

312
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,190
Speaker 0: I think like things escalate rapidly.

313
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,255
Speaker 1: That's what I was gonna say.

314
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,349
Speaker 1: The lieutenant governor would just be like, hey, I ordered the National Guard to go.

315
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:54,609
Speaker 0: Okay, there's the other thing you gotta remember for a scene as these militias are the one thing they are not is intelligence.

316
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,750
Speaker 1: So But well, I mean it's already showed that they're not intelligent.

317
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,810
Speaker 1: They thought that kidnapping the governor makes you the governor or something.

318
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:12,476
Speaker 0: Yeah but they seem to have been emboldened because of Trump talking about how Michigan needs to be liberated from its Democratic government and It's like that instigated them.

319
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:13,742
Speaker 0: That's one point.

320
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:27,149
Speaker 0: and all this shit show of 2020 but - they're a pretty big militia and I think 13 of their leaders are currently like arrested and The FBI has already said like yeah, this whole organization is going down like here we come.

321
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:28,193
Speaker 0: it's.

322
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:36,890
Speaker 0: uh, it's a crazy story and my news is that In any other year, this would have been like the headline for weeks.

323
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:39,917
Speaker 0: This is barely being covered.

324
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:54,149
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'd be the headline for weeks because the things like it actually happens pretty often because on this scale It happens pretty often where the law enforcement discovers something horrible and stops it in advance, right?

325
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,795
Speaker 1: Yeah There have been several terrorist incidents.

326
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:09,286
Speaker 1: would that have been stopped in advance and not just the ones where they trick someone into like where the FBI was the one selling someone bombs right more like here's yeah Here's a terror cell of three people that's real that we found and we stopped them.

327
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:09,970
Speaker 0: We found their bomb.

328
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:15,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, it actually it happens right but those stories tend not to be big news.

329
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,806
Speaker 1: The only time they're big news is if the person actually attempts their thing, right?

330
00:23:19,826 --> 00:23:24,006
Speaker 1: So like, you know Fertilizer bomber guy in Times Square, right?

331
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:26,154
Speaker 1: It's like yeah He just pretty much failed.

332
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:31,409
Speaker 1: but it's like he attempted his thing and then got caught and therefore is a much bigger news story.

333
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,416
Speaker 1: if they Had just found that guy a day earlier.

334
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:44,029
Speaker 0: You wouldn't you might not even know about it, you know, so Yeah, but in this case it did that like if you read the whole thing This was a way more organized and serious plot than his typical.

335
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:46,310
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It was definitely a big a big-time plot.

336
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,963
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying is that the the bigness of the news is due to the.

337
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:50,244
Speaker 1: the.

338
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:53,439
Speaker 1: the non bigness of the news is due To the being caught in advance.

339
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,745
Speaker 0: I Don't think it's just that because this is bigger than any motion you can militia thing.

340
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:02,103
Speaker 0: that's happened in a long time And I think it's man gets man.

341
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,709
Speaker 1: Man gets stopped from biting dog is not as big a story as man bites dog.

342
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know no matter how big the man or how crazy the dog you should They.

343
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:20,070
Speaker 0: their plan was actually pretty comprehensive coming down to blowing up a bunch of bridges that they were like.

344
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:23,935
Speaker 0: This was like a full-on Paramilitary operation.

345
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:24,617
Speaker 1: Yes.

346
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:29,954
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter that no matter how big the dog or how scary the man Man gets.

347
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:32,686
Speaker 1: stopped from biting dog is not as big a news story now.

348
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:33,450
Speaker 0: We're in a news cycle.

349
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,998
Speaker 0: We're like the fly that was showing us.

350
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:39,849
Speaker 0: Mike Pence's true nature is like the big news and already that's being forgotten.

351
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,048
Speaker 1: No, I mean, that's a that's a. they live situation.

352
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:47,610
Speaker 0: Yeah I was actually watching that stupid debate because Kamala did a great job.

353
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,710
Speaker 0: But the funniest thing was I'm watching it and then the fly appears and I literally stand up like what the fuck how to fly.

354
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,765
Speaker 0: Get in here and I go over to like hit the TV and I'm like, oh, oh shit.

355
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,110
Speaker 0: It's actually on him.

356
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,773
Speaker 1: Why didn't?

357
00:24:58,833 --> 00:24:59,818
Speaker 1: why didn't he swat it?

358
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,707
Speaker 1: Uh, that's what I don't understand.

359
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:04,762
Speaker 0: I He might just be even like.

360
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:05,608
Speaker 0: I don't know that is.

361
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:07,132
Speaker 0: That is.

362
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:18,226
Speaker 0: it is weird that he did not notice that because I noticed if a net comes within like a foot of my face I know right like like if we're in a panel and like a fly comes anywhere near the stage.

363
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:23,989
Speaker 0: We're both like what the fuck fly anyway.

364
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,574
Speaker 0: things Of the day.

365
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:30,130
Speaker 1: when I was a kid my parents took us on a lot of you know vacations, right?

366
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,736
Speaker 1: But you know, they weren't necessarily.

367
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,227
Speaker 1: they weren't the tiniest vacations, right?

368
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:40,210
Speaker 1: We weren't Unfortunate and poor we didn't like not go anywhere, but they also weren't the extravagant vacations.

369
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,382
Speaker 1: I know a lot of people went on who had mad moneys, right?

370
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:56,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, so One of the places we went was the Catskill game farm Which is a place in the Catskills of New York, and it was basically like a mega petting zoo, right?

371
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:04,821
Speaker 1: It's like they had all kinds of animals going on in there like giraffes even right You know, I don't know this was way back.

372
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:15,090
Speaker 1: I don't know how well the animals were treated You don't know Right, but this is a place that like had everything from you know sheep up to giraffe, right?

373
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,956
Speaker 1: And you would go there you'd pay admission.

374
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:17,919
Speaker 1: It wasn't like a zoo.

375
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:23,224
Speaker 1: It was like a petting zoo like very interactive You know, they called it a game farm, right?

376
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:23,948
Speaker 1: They didn't call it a zoo.

377
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:29,729
Speaker 1: I don't think they had a lot of you know, wasn't an educational place necessarily.

378
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:37,490
Speaker 1: But anyway, apparently I had you know, we joke about it because we know my cousin.

379
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:40,970
Speaker 1: There was some incidents there where she was very afraid of all the animals.

380
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,886
Speaker 1: You know the place had memories from my family right where it were created there.

381
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:47,946
Speaker 1: We only went there once though anyway.

382
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:52,410
Speaker 1: So apparently I you know, I hadn't thought about the place in forever.

383
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,569
Speaker 1: So I didn't realize that it was sold some years ago.

384
00:26:56,172 --> 00:27:03,817
Speaker 1: And when it was sold, you know people tried to rescue as many animals as they could and you know to keep them from getting You know sent to some who knows where.

385
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,905
Speaker 0: that's literally what my mom's job used to be.

386
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:16,110
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, it was sold to some people and those for a very low price and those people attempted to Basically convert it to like an inn, right?

387
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:22,110
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you would go and stay there and like a fancy kind of in bed-and-breakfast kind of place.

388
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,679
Speaker 1: You know, they renovated some of the buildings on the property.

389
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,522
Speaker 1: It's a large property.

390
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, the photos look nice.

391
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:27,850
Speaker 0: It looks like renovated.

392
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, they definitely successfully renovated it.

393
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,273
Speaker 0: you know what it looks like.

394
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:37,669
Speaker 0: look at these bedrooms rustic chic as in it looks rustic on purpose as opposed to Rustic because it's worn down and rustic.

395
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they all the animals are gone.

396
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:53,580
Speaker 1: They've been gone for years, but people renovated it and I noticed just by chance because we were discussing real estate I did a search on like Zillow and I just saw it pop up as like the most expensive property in the Catskills.

397
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,854
Speaker 1: at two million dollars It was for sale.

398
00:27:56,954 --> 00:28:03,489
Speaker 1: So it seems that I guess because of the kovat situation or just because of bad business No one's staying at this in.

399
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:08,020
Speaker 1: So They lost their investment and they're trying to recoup it.

400
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:13,305
Speaker 1: So I was like, hey listen, you know, I understand you lost your.

401
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:16,982
Speaker 1: you made a bad investment But you just sort of you just have to take a loss on that.

402
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:18,430
Speaker 1: You're not gonna be able to make back your money.

403
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,975
Speaker 1: No one's paying two million dollars for that.

404
00:28:20,256 --> 00:28:24,830
Speaker 0: I mean two million dollars could almost buy a two-bedroom apartment in my neighborhood.

405
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,201
Speaker 1: it's like But apparently there's a pending offer.

406
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,670
Speaker 1: I don't know how big the offer is.

407
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,570
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's two million dollars or not, but somebody's offered to buy it according to the internet, which is fascinating.

408
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:43,349
Speaker 1: so I wonder if the people who tried to do the renovation are gonna just take a loss how big a loss they're gonna take.

409
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:47,743
Speaker 1: but It's interesting just to see this, you know, sort of like.

410
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:49,210
Speaker 1: it's sort of like the action park, right?

411
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,062
Speaker 1: It's like usually we see these abandoned amusement park type places.

412
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,226
Speaker 1: Just be abandoned.

413
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:54,587
Speaker 1: Yeah,

414
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,630
Speaker 0: please slowly decline

415
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:11,864
Speaker 1: Right, it's like you look at like the splendid China in Orlando, which is a place We also went which is owned by the China or was owned by the Chinese government might still be I don't know but they set up a propaganda ish amusement park in in Orlando right to.

416
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:17,246
Speaker 1: that celebrates China Has like fake terracotta warriors and that sort of thing, right?

417
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:21,470
Speaker 1: We went there And that place I'm pretty sure is still just abandoned.

418
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:30,490
Speaker 1: I don't know who owns it But it's weird to see one Abandoned be owned and tried to actually be used or done something with especially at a time like this.

419
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,024
Speaker 0: Fuck is a three-quarter bathroom as opposed to a full.

420
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,150
Speaker 0: I know a full and a half bath.

421
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,775
Speaker 0: I've no idea what a three-quarter bath is.

422
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:48,950
Speaker 1: I don't know if you google it and find out I am right now, but but yeah Has a shower but no tub, okay Okay, but yeah go and check out the Zillow posting for the castle game farm.

423
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:52,310
Speaker 1: You can also google it on the internet and read about the history of the castle.

424
00:29:54,052 --> 00:30:01,883
Speaker 1: It's an interesting kind of place that I think people who aren't from New York Or aren't older don't even know exists and don't even think about.

425
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:14,219
Speaker 0: but there are a lot of things that are within like a day trip of New York that exists primarily to serve kids who live in the New York area and like go upstate to Experience nature and such.

426
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:23,410
Speaker 1: well, there's a lot of things in the Catskills Specifically, especially in the era before you know cheaper commercial more widely available commercial flight.

427
00:30:23,852 --> 00:30:31,990
Speaker 1: The many people who lived in New York and you know this New York area Needed to go on vacations and there are many leisurely destinations.

428
00:30:32,512 --> 00:30:42,229
Speaker 1: Same reason Atlantic City existed like people couldn't just fly to Vegas for a long time Especially in the Catskills this place like Lake Compounce in Connecticut, which I think is still open.

429
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:54,110
Speaker 1: That were like these leisurely vacation resort type places and especially in the Catskills The culture of going there is completely gone and a lot of those places are abandoned closed out of business.

430
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,718
Speaker 0: Goodbye, there are the region like.

431
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:56,764
Speaker 0: there are places like that.

432
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:57,990
Speaker 1: They are very fascinating.

433
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:01,650
Speaker 0: There are places like that everywhere like Cedar Point was one of those places.

434
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:09,910
Speaker 0: The only reason it survived is that it became a roller coaster park in the era When people could actually just fly to Florida instead of going to Lake Erie.

435
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,455
Speaker 1: Right, it's like if you weren't worse.

436
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:17,910
Speaker 1: there were places that were leisurely destinations that were worth going to because they were within range.

437
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:18,532
Speaker 1: Right.

438
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:24,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as soon as if you're not the best thing in range Well, people can just fly to a better thing.

439
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:30,717
Speaker 1: So you have to be like the best thing, you know, that's like I wouldn't have gone to Cedar Point.

440
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:31,580
Speaker 0: We couldn't afford that.

441
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,869
Speaker 0: We would have gone to whatever like Six Flags was near us.

442
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:34,893
Speaker 0: We just it's like.

443
00:31:34,913 --> 00:31:57,028
Speaker 1: you have to either be worth flying to like Disney World people come from all over Or you have to be good enough that someone who can fly Right is who or is decided not to fly or can't afford to fly will choose you Right, and there's not too many people left because so many people are flying so not too many of those things can exist locally.

444
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:00,525
Speaker 1: Yep So but yeah, the abandoned ones are fascinating.

445
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:05,390
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day I got to back up a little bit to the concept of BMX bikes.

446
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:10,728
Speaker 0: Uh BMX biking wasn't really a thing until the early 80s like late 70s.

447
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,930
Speaker 1: Oh the early that is that is true.

448
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,567
Speaker 1: In fact my town in the in the 90s had a BMX track at one of the parks.

449
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:18,210
Speaker 1: It might still be.

450
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,295
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we had one too.

451
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,890
Speaker 0: I had a BMX bike and I went there and there were certain kids.

452
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:25,621
Speaker 1: I didn't I wasn't one of those kids but I knew some kids were.

453
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,026
Speaker 1: it's like they were on they like.

454
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,034
Speaker 1: they went there and Competed officially.

455
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:31,302
Speaker 1: It was almost like a little league level competitive.

456
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,410
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, my middle school had a BMX team.

457
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,763
Speaker 0: It was the school supported it, but it was like a little one.

458
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:38,490
Speaker 1: It didn't have anything to do with the school.

459
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:39,034
Speaker 1: It was.

460
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:40,910
Speaker 1: I don't know who ran it, but it was ours.

461
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,432
Speaker 0: We did.

462
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:46,190
Speaker 0: it was a third-party thing, but the school like endorsed it and kids from the school would go to it.

463
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:48,862
Speaker 1: But here was.

464
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,093
Speaker 1: I Found it on.

465
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,442
Speaker 1: I found it on Google.

466
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,047
Speaker 1: Yep, Trumbull BMX track.

467
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:55,449
Speaker 1: I found it.

468
00:32:55,489 --> 00:33:07,010
Speaker 0: There it is but I feel like it's interesting because Before like our generation like me and Scott born in the early 80s We grew up during the literal beginning and peak of BMX biking.

469
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,710
Speaker 0: So today most kids get like a tricycle and then they basically get like a mountain bike or a cruiser next.

470
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:23,390
Speaker 0: When we were kid and before that it was similar when we were kids Every kid got a BMX bike before they got a bigger bike like BMX bike was the step above trike for most kids.

471
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:29,486
Speaker 1: Because yeah, I think before before mountain because mountain bikes are actually a relatively recent invention.

472
00:33:29,646 --> 00:33:31,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were like before.

473
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:35,130
Speaker 0: Before that were like hacked together monstrosities that didn't like a custom.

474
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:43,529
Speaker 1: It's like before the Toys R Us racks are filled with mountain bikes They were filled with BMX bikes basic and before that they were filled with Cruiser bikes.

475
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah.

476
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:54,190
Speaker 1: But the BMX biking that you know that style was basically, you know more like a motocross, but you pedal.

477
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:58,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, it literally just stands for it's a bicycle motocross.

478
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:03,733
Speaker 1: Yes, it's just a dirt track with a bunch of hills excite bikes around Like that.

479
00:34:03,774 --> 00:34:08,406
Speaker 1: you race around by pedaling you do jumps that sort of thing and that was like.

480
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:16,061
Speaker 0: but the problem was it's not bad because the thing about BMX biking was that most kids did not actually BMX bike on BMX courses.

481
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:22,003
Speaker 0: they got BMX bikes But then they ride them around the neighborhood and BMX bikes actually really suck at that.

482
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:23,628
Speaker 0: but that like they sure do.

483
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:33,152
Speaker 0: Yep so my thing of the day is This archive of the totally rad fad of 80s BMX and this is like All the.

484
00:34:33,212 --> 00:34:34,574
Speaker 1: it was a totally rad fad.

485
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:35,016
Speaker 1: just

486
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:46,351
Speaker 0: the style the advertising the counterculture the culture like the Advertisements that got kids into it the celebrities from it the aesthetics of it the everything It's just all

487
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:53,739
Speaker 1: definitely has a particular aesthetic of like a checkered flag and like yeah, that's like super That's kind of it's cut, you know.

488
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,470
Speaker 1: at the time it was a little bit cheesy But now it's kind of retro cheesy cool or like really like badly clashing colors like the color scheme of BM.

489
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,253
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right.

490
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:04,501
Speaker 1: It's all about bright colors like neon

491
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,750
Speaker 0: zinc NASCAR, but on a shitty looking bike

492
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,794
Speaker 1: Exactly, but he

493
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:23,927
Speaker 0: was huge like as a kid like we had like I had some BMX like racer trading cards like the capitalist system was really trying to sell kids on how cool BMX was and it worked on us for a long time and This webpage just shows that.

494
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:29,610
Speaker 0: is that Somewhat adjacent to monster truck as well, which I was also very into as a kid.

495
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:35,222
Speaker 0: I thought that was a career I could have be a monster truck driver, which technically I guess good That is a career you could have.

496
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,292
Speaker 0: I think it pays that much Huh?

497
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:39,686
Speaker 1: I don't know how much it pays but it's a career you can have.

498
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,896
Speaker 0: also a fun fact I went to many monster truck shows.

499
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:43,703
Speaker 0: I never went to.

500
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:44,686
Speaker 1: I went to zero.

501
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:45,670
Speaker 1: I only saw the commercial.

502
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,557
Speaker 0: I went to so many going.

503
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,910
Speaker 0: I even went to like low tier like semi amateur ones.

504
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:54,622
Speaker 0: But I also went to a lot of demolition derbies as a kid.

505
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:55,264
Speaker 0: I grew up in Michigan.

506
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:55,725
Speaker 0: What do you want?

507
00:35:55,745 --> 00:36:02,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I Never once saw grave digger actually complete a course.

508
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:08,150
Speaker 0: every time grave digger was there it either broke down Before the race or broke down in the race.

509
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:09,777
Speaker 0: I never saw it finish a race.

510
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,216
Speaker 0: even once my entire life even though it was my favorite car Wasn't Bigfoot like the big one.

511
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:19,850
Speaker 0: Yeah Bigfoot was like the Hulk Hogan and that's what everyone liked great.

512
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:21,786
Speaker 1: So grave digger was like the undertaker dig.

513
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, great Literally grave jigger was.

514
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:30,168
Speaker 0: the people who liked the undertaker tended to like grave digger The same way that kids today was like, I don't know Reaper from overwatch.

515
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:31,886
Speaker 0: I was that kid.

516
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:37,325
Speaker 0: Everyone's got their Bigfoot shirt and I'm the kid with like the grave digger shirt.

517
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,010
Speaker 0: like ah, I like the cool car.

518
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:48,890
Speaker 0: Anyway in the meta moment the geek nice book club book, we're not reading the tale again because we're not reading anything nothing at all.

519

Speaker 0: I read a whole chapter of the Tale of Genji on the way back from PAX East Which was literally the start of quarantine and that was the last time.

530
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,450
Speaker 1: I may have read some around then as well.

531

Speaker 0: We just did another panel.

537
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:45,196
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to get the video of a director's cut of the panel We did at PAX online up on our YouTube channel this weekend, maybe like Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest But I don't know otherwise.

538
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:46,963
Speaker 0: we got no conventions coming up.

539
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:48,690
Speaker 0: we're getting into the cold dark times.

540
00:37:49,091 --> 00:37:52,624
Speaker 0: We're getting into the times where normally we have a bunch of travel and vacations.

541
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:56,169
Speaker 0: geek nights gets interrupted a bunch But I ain't going anywhere.

542
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:59,596
Speaker 1: Nope You know, I don't want to shit talk.

543
00:37:59,616 --> 00:38:00,259
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna.

544
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:09,095
Speaker 1: but I will say that you know I was under the impression that my work was going to increase the number of vacation days We could hold over to next year.

545
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:09,617
Speaker 1: who they?

546
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:11,866
Speaker 0: but they lied but did not confirm right?

547
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:13,960
Speaker 1: Right, right They basically said they.

548
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:23,689
Speaker 1: well they said pretty much You know, hold on we're gonna be making it in some Messaging about that around the block too many times to trust that.

549
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:33,761
Speaker 1: right, so, you know, they basically said well, we'll say something about that soon, but like my My product manager recently that's my said that he was.

550
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,954
Speaker 1: he was pressured to use PTO Which he hadn't used all year.

551
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:39,620
Speaker 1: So he's taking off next week.

552
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:42,690
Speaker 1: So this is making me think they're there, you know.

553
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:47,910
Speaker 0: Hopefully we had like a lot of days like way too many saved up, right?

554
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,290
Speaker 1: Well, the point is I might end up not working most of December, right?

555
00:38:53,410 --> 00:39:04,268
Speaker 1: So I can't shit talk and say yeah, if I don't work most of December, I'm gonna do some stuff But if I don't work for most of December, it is likely I'll do something.

556
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:10,609
Speaker 1: Yep I hope I mean I might not but I would feel guilty if I didn't make even one thing.

557
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:15,548
Speaker 0: Oh my god I'm still like kovat messes up my sense of time like this quarantine to be in the house.

558
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:20,710
Speaker 0: Like I Feel like every time I'm relaxing like even though I'm just playing Star Wars.

559
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:25,910
Speaker 0: I'm thinking I should really be like making a panel editing some stuff like putting more geek nights.

560
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,476
Speaker 1: I made a panel during.

561
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:28,500
Speaker 1: I already did my coat.

562
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,824
Speaker 0: We did a bunch of panels already.

563
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:31,310
Speaker 1: You're you're gonna upload.

564
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:32,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I want.

565
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:34,490
Speaker 0: but I had a bunch of solo panels I wanted to do.

566
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,749
Speaker 0: I want to start the utenna thing, but I don't have time.

567
00:39:38,894 --> 00:39:39,827
Speaker 0: Well, you'll have some time.

568
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:41,470
Speaker 0: We'll see if you do anything.

569
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:44,100
Speaker 1: So if I have time, yeah, we'll see.

570
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,950
Speaker 0: I don't have time so it can't be joint projects.

571
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:50,590
Speaker 0: I have no more free time than I normally would Mmm, so yeah, let's get right into it.

572
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:59,229
Speaker 0: It's a spooky times time to watch spooky stuff and we got together with a bunch of our friends and we watch Vampires versus the Brock's.

573
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:05,265
Speaker 0: We'll get to spoilers at the end because I want to talk about like the things that happen in this movie But to review it first don't worry.

574
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:09,760
Speaker 1: No spoilers Yeah, so this is a movie that is Netflix exclusive.

575
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,683
Speaker 1: I think Netflix made it.

576
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:11,024
Speaker 1: Yep.

577
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:11,967
Speaker 1: It's a pretty.

578
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:12,950
Speaker 1: it's a pretty short movie.

579
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,625
Speaker 0: I think I don't think it's that long like it looks like they started on it in 2018 but then they cut a deal with Netflix to like get it fully made and like that's.

580
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:24,030
Speaker 0: you could read the story and Basically, it's a story pretty straightforward.

581
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:29,847
Speaker 1: Where there are vampires in the Bronx, that's not a spoiler.

582
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:35,995
Speaker 1: It's in the title And it's in the.

583
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:36,978
Speaker 1: it's in the summary.

584
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:40,970
Speaker 1: right the vampires are also committing gentrification.

585
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:49,717
Speaker 1: they're buying up properties and Converting them from say, you know a bodega into you know a bone and thread.

586
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,601
Speaker 1: is it?

587
00:40:51,464 --> 00:40:52,910
Speaker 1: is it a food place or is it a?

588
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:57,863
Speaker 0: The worst part is one of the fake gentrification things was that butter store.

589
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:05,685
Speaker 0: and while my brain said Simultaneously that is some gentrifying bullshit a part of my brain said I would shop there.

590
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:10,545
Speaker 1: I would go buy fancy butter I would buy fancy butter and make cookies out of it.

591
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:12,110
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway.

592
00:41:14,194 --> 00:41:15,970
Speaker 1: So it's a. it's a you know, it's a pretty.

593
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:23,856
Speaker 1: It's Not like a super complex movie is a straightforward Vampire movie.

594
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:31,670
Speaker 1: In fact, I will say it is I would say it's at the level of like a made-for-tv movie the kind of thing you'd see on like wonderful world of Disney.

595
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,038
Speaker 0: I'd say it's a full step above that.

596
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:37,190
Speaker 0: It is actually at the level of quality of the Lost Boys.

597
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:45,544
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I would say right on time out Like The acting is better than one of those TV movies for certain.

598
00:41:45,564 --> 00:41:47,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're right in terms of the plot.

599
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,294
Speaker 0: It is fairly straightforward.

600
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:49,698
Speaker 0: The few twists are right.

601
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:51,543
Speaker 0: good, but they're not like.

602
00:41:51,564 --> 00:41:55,288
Speaker 0: there's not Citizen Kane twists Yeah, not even close, right?

603
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,817
Speaker 0: But the Lost Boys 2 is a very straightforward plot.

604
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:04,724
Speaker 0: kid move kid is in town finds vampires vampire shit happens vampire confrontation happens.

605
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:05,349
Speaker 0: end of movie.

606
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:07,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much right it's.

607
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:10,705
Speaker 1: it's a movie about some kids, you know, they live in the Bronx.

608
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:17,050
Speaker 1: they discover these problems You know, they fight their problems with the help of the community right the community bands together.

609
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:30,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much exactly what you expect really straightforward But with that simple formula that doesn't really have you know Too much clever or new or interesting about the formula wise right.

610
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:33,735
Speaker 1: the execution It's like wow, you know you did.

611
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:39,370
Speaker 1: you took that cookie cutter, right and you just like cut out the best damn cookie, right?

612
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,654
Speaker 1: It's like the cookie.

613
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:43,844
Speaker 1: It's like you cut the edges of the cookie cutter.

614
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:47,396
Speaker 1: Perfect the thickness of the cookie Perfectly uniform right.

615
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:53,149
Speaker 1: the dough and the flavor of the cookie as good as it could be in a plain old butter cookie Which is still damn tasty.

616
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:59,010
Speaker 0: I want to eat that like the characters and like their chatter with each other like are just great.

617
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:01,229
Speaker 0: Like the characters are really compelling really fun.

618
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:06,323
Speaker 0: They're deep enough without like everyone having a long origin story nonsense.

619
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,770
Speaker 0: Like it just hits all the right beats.

620
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:11,659
Speaker 1: They missed on a few things.

621
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:13,810
Speaker 1: There were some characters that could have had more screen time.

622
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:14,975
Speaker 1: Maybe some that had too much.

623
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:18,270
Speaker 0: one of them should have had one bust out moment and killed a vampire.

624
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:19,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they didn't.

625
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:23,869
Speaker 0: I was hoping the priest would do more but the priest was funny enough.

626
00:43:26,628 --> 00:43:35,538
Speaker 0: I Did hope he did more also I hope do you I hope he would show up and be the dad or the grandpa from Lost Boys That like I expected that to happen.

627
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:36,963
Speaker 0: That was the only thing.

628
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:38,568
Speaker 0: I expect this movie to do that.

629
00:43:38,608 --> 00:43:39,110
Speaker 0: It did not do.

630
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:45,246
Speaker 1: Yep The movie is extremely New York II and extremely Bronx II, right?

631
00:43:45,266 --> 00:43:53,221
Speaker 1: So if you're not From the New York or spend a lot of time in New York or from the Bronx You might learn some stuff about New York and the Bronx like

632
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:58,429
Speaker 0: all those things like the kids hanging out in the bodega Like randomly in the back room like yeah, that's New York like that.

633
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:02,364
Speaker 1: That's like there's a lot of genuine New York stuff in this movie.

634
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:06,384
Speaker 1: That is like absolutely, you know No one's looking at that and saying that's not New York.

635
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:07,229
Speaker 1: Like no that that's.

636
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:08,453
Speaker 1: yeah This is what I know.

637
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:17,590
Speaker 0: Ghostbusters is very Manhattan like super like set in Manhattan Capital M. this movie is that for the Bronx, right?

638
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,470
Speaker 1: But I think that Ghostbusters if you know nothing about New York, you don't really lose anything.

639
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you don't need to know that's tavern on the green.

640
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:27,158
Speaker 0: But if you're in New York, you do like.

641
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:29,430
Speaker 0: you got a little extra context, right?

642
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:39,110
Speaker 1: But I think that if you're not familiar with New York Nothing major is going to be lost on you in this movie, but some small things will be right.

643
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:44,270
Speaker 1: So for example, there's a scene where somebody throws a Timberland boot.

644
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:50,875
Speaker 1: vampire, right Spoiler On the one hand right?

645
00:44:50,895 --> 00:44:55,650
Speaker 1: It's like nothing is lost on the humor of someone throwing a boot at a vampire, right?

646
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,978
Speaker 1: It's like that's gonna work no matter who you are.

647
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,764
Speaker 1: No matter what your background is, right?

648
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,008
Speaker 1: You're gonna laugh at that.

649
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:01,430
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

650
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:10,260
Speaker 1: But if you're New York II you realize the relevance of the Timberland boot Specifically in New York, right?

651
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:13,210
Speaker 1: It's like part of the New York uniform, you know.

652
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,253
Speaker 1: Okay Right.

653
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,188
Speaker 1: It's like especially in the cold or the winter months, right?

654
00:45:18,228 --> 00:45:24,153
Speaker 1: Like Timberlands and like, you know, one of those black pea coats that is like that's a New Yorker No matter where.

655
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:27,348
Speaker 1: if they're standing in a tropical island, you know, that's a New Yorker.

656
00:45:27,408 --> 00:45:30,790
Speaker 0: or like Why is everyone suddenly going to church in the middle of the night?

657
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:34,470
Speaker 0: Because of these kids like there's a scene around that like yeah, that would happen.

658
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like that.

659
00:45:37,123 --> 00:45:37,809
Speaker 0: would you know happen?

660
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:44,649
Speaker 1: exactly, so You know, I think if you're not from New York, you might miss very small things.

661
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:51,250
Speaker 0: I think it'll be a lot like people who like a lot of Like similar, right, I think it's true.

662
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:58,484
Speaker 1: Maybe it's more true to say you're not missing anything if you're not New York II But if you are New York II you're gaining something right the special.

663
00:45:58,906 --> 00:46:05,825
Speaker 1: this special sweet You know spice is added to Tease the palette of a New Yorker in this movie.

664
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:11,181
Speaker 0: Well, like when I was a kid Like I'd like Seinfeld like there's a show I watch but are?

665
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:17,269
Speaker 0: there's the episode where George Costanza has to like Double park the cars and deal with the cars.

666
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:22,230
Speaker 0: That did not make any sense to me as a kid like as a kid like I didn't get it.

667
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:29,983
Speaker 0: I could not understand what the hell the plot of that episode was Because that's really like that's a New York thing and only a New York thing.

668
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,270
Speaker 0: all to decide parking and all that nonsense.

669
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:37,850
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly, but this movie does not have any moment like that where you'll just be like what the fuck.

670
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:44,229
Speaker 0: Except maybe the fact that the community would literally like get church to happen because of an incident like that.

671
00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:45,513
Speaker 1: Yep.

672
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,055
Speaker 1: All right.

673
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:48,402
Speaker 1: So also the vampires in this movie.

674
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:50,268
Speaker 1: It's not ultra gory, right?

675
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,785
Speaker 0: So you're not gonna be exactly as gory as the Lost Boys from 1987.

676
00:46:55,785 --> 00:47:02,958
Speaker 1: like that level The vampires are very classical Vampires in terms of the rules around them.

677
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:09,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know and it's actually nice that the Characters in the movie are not dumb, right?

678
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:14,225
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you know, usually horror movie You got if you're getting upset because people are playing dumb.

679
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:14,527
Speaker 1: It's like.

680
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:17,157
Speaker 1: no These characters like Oh vampires.

681
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:18,703
Speaker 1: We know all the things about vampires.

682
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,108
Speaker 1: One of the kids reads horror novels.

683
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:20,810
Speaker 1: He knows right?

684
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,211
Speaker 1: It's like.

685
00:47:21,674 --> 00:47:24,206
Speaker 1: it's like don't invite them in they don't fucking invite them in.

686
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:24,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

687
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:26,493
Speaker 0: It's just.

688
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:33,002
Speaker 0: this is why I keep bringing up the Lost Boys because not only is this movie like superficially similar to Lost Boys Like it's almost the same plot.

689
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:35,395
Speaker 0: people are in a town There's vampires.

690
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,299
Speaker 0: the kids figure it out.

691
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,485
Speaker 0: the adults don't like.

692
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:38,289
Speaker 0: how do you deal with it?

693
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:48,123
Speaker 0: But there are some scenes that are beat-for-beat Identical scenes in this movie to scenes in the Lost Boys and there are also.

694
00:47:48,184 --> 00:47:50,530
Speaker 0: you can almost map most of the characters one-to-one.

695
00:47:51,234 --> 00:48:01,928
Speaker 0: Not all the characters obviously because this movie is very New York but there are many characters that map one-to-one like the Character who is legit a vampire hunter in the Lost Boys.

696
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:07,530
Speaker 0: the same thing There's like the kids who like actually are vampire hunters and like go through the list of what to do with vampires.

697
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:10,603
Speaker 0: The characters are smart and they go to the church to seal holy water.

698
00:48:10,643 --> 00:48:15,723
Speaker 0: that happens in both of these movies And I think yeah, it's.

699
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:20,826
Speaker 1: It's basically, you know, I mean to say it's just lost boys for 2020.

700
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:22,050
Speaker 1: Why would you watch the Lost Boys now?

701
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,134
Speaker 1: Just watch this instead.

702
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,057
Speaker 1: kind of true.

703
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:24,920
Speaker 0: Yeah kind of true.

704
00:48:25,261 --> 00:48:27,790
Speaker 0: Also this movie like Lost Boys is not a diverse movie.

705
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:33,330
Speaker 0: It was 1987 Hollywood like yeah set in a Wildwood esque place.

706
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,787
Speaker 0: But vampires versus the Bronx is just a solid horror movie horror comedy.

707
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:40,770
Speaker 0: Like it's worth watching.

708
00:48:40,891 --> 00:48:42,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think there's a lot of horror going on.

709
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,229
Speaker 0: Quote horror genre because it's got Dracula's in it.

710
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,990
Speaker 0: But it is not a horror movie so much as it is a. it's mostly a comedy.

711
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:56,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got touching moments.

712
00:48:56,258 --> 00:48:56,579

718
00:49:04,997 --> 00:49:07,650
Speaker 1: But if it's you're here in the Halloween season, right?

719

00:49:26,957 --> 00:49:28,605
Speaker 0: How have you never seen event horizon?

724
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,570
Speaker 0: Well, I was dealing with the sink.

725
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,219
Speaker 0: I overheard everyone talking about what movie we were gonna watch.

726
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:36,632
Speaker 0: How have no I was like no one in our crew seen event horizon Is it?

727
00:49:36,692 --> 00:49:37,775
Speaker 1: is it that good that I should go say?

728
00:49:37,796 --> 00:49:38,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

729
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:42,090
Speaker 0: it's like a classic for a reason horror space horror movie.

730
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:45,178
Speaker 1: I don't even know if I. maybe I have seen it.

731
00:49:45,198 --> 00:49:45,861
Speaker 1: I just don't know it.

732
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:47,828
Speaker 1: I don't know but it's uh, it's.

733
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:48,110
Speaker 0: there's.

734
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:52,392
Speaker 0: There's portal to hell stuff going on All right.

735
00:49:52,613 --> 00:49:53,335
Speaker 1: Sure, whatever.

736
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:58,290
Speaker 0: All right anyway, but yeah spoilers past this point because I want to talk about specific stuff in this movie.

737
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,837
Speaker 0: So stop listening.

738
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,976
Speaker 0: if you haven't watched it because the movie is great There's no reason not to watch it.

739
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:04,900
Speaker 0: and now we're gonna.

740
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,066
Speaker 1: the movie won't be ruined.

741
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:07,050
Speaker 1: Even if it's spoiled.

742
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,001
Speaker 0: No, I mean like spoilers they beat the van.

743
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,690
Speaker 0: everything at the end, right?

744
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,472
Speaker 1: It's like it's.

745
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:14,101
Speaker 1: everything that happens in the movie is kind of obvious.

746
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:14,361
Speaker 1: There's.

747
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:16,669
Speaker 1: no there's no surprises really.

748
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,758
Speaker 1: if you're Unless you're a kid, then you'll be surprised.

749
00:50:19,778 --> 00:50:20,421
Speaker 0: There's two scenes.

750
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:21,305
Speaker 0: I want to be an adult.

751
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:22,330
Speaker 1: Nothing will surprise you.

752
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:32,678
Speaker 0: The funniest scene to me is when the priest looks up and sees that the three kids are missing Just the way he reacted to.

753
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:39,557
Speaker 0: that was like the funniest scene in the whole movie But also the way that they they should.

754
00:50:39,597 --> 00:50:43,350
Speaker 1: they use the camera to be from the first-person perspective of the priest.

755
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:49,070
Speaker 0: Right, there's like pants like an around kid one kid to kid three like he's scanning almost like the Terminator.

756
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:50,954
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

757
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:51,657
Speaker 1: So that was pretty.

758
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:54,026
Speaker 1: but and then they were mad that he stole.

759
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:54,930
Speaker 1: they stole his sprite.

760
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,369
Speaker 1: But really they just stole the sprite bottles to put holy water.

761
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:10,266
Speaker 0: But my favorite scene I think is when they're all in the apartment and the vampire shows up and the kid Tells the mom like don't she's a vampire and the mom believes the kid.

762
00:51:10,346 --> 00:51:11,611
Speaker 0: the mom is just like yeah Like.

763
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:16,990
Speaker 0: immediately the mom is like, okay, I'm actually gonna listen and I think that's one of the primary themes of this movie.

764
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:26,169
Speaker 0: This is almost a deconstruction of horror movies because most horror movies especially horror movies made by white people with white people Always have the plot of no one believes the kids.

765
00:51:26,852 --> 00:51:28,960
Speaker 0: People in the community don't trust each other at the start.

766
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,309
Speaker 1: at the start people didn't believe the kids right.

767
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:34,418
Speaker 1: so much Right, they didn't leave the kids but what they did do?

768
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:38,670
Speaker 0: they trusted that there was something up because of the way the kids were acting.

769
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:57,680
Speaker 0: there's the theme in this movie that the community in the Bronx is very close-knit and the supposition the vampires had that no one would notice people missing from the Bronx is only true if you ignore the fact that the People in the Bronx will notice and that that community is way tighter than probably most other like many other communities in New York City.

770
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:03,159
Speaker 1: Mmm for a lot of reasons like yeah, and you could say I did really appreciate that.

771
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:05,873
Speaker 1: the end It's like how many horror movies end right?

772
00:52:05,913 --> 00:52:14,700
Speaker 0: Like that's the one You know what one Frankenstein's and that way the whole town man's together, but not for the good reasons not for the good reason, right?

773
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:23,380
Speaker 1: It's like when have you seen a horror movie end where it's like, yeah, actually Everyone gets on the same page realizes the bad guys are bad, right?

774
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:30,065
Speaker 0: You know, yeah when the kids like don't invite her in and the mom it like listens to him and turns and it's like All right, wait up.

775
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:31,979
Speaker 0: We got to figure out what's going on here, right?

776
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:32,962
Speaker 1: It's like.

777
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:37,320
Speaker 1: not only it's like does everyone believe you now, but everyone's gonna work together with you now, right?

778
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,148
Speaker 1: Oh in marrow, it just has run away.

779
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:41,560
Speaker 0: It's the guy who plays Tony in the bodega.

780
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,008
Speaker 0: That's marrow from Jesus and marrow, which is just hilarious.

781
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:51,800
Speaker 0: But the second he figures out the vampires are real He's like, oh shit and immediately calls them like yo, the vampires are real.

782
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:56,546
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly The whole movie is filled with moments like that.

783
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:58,833
Speaker 0: Nobody does anything stupid.

784
00:52:59,234 --> 00:53:06,322
Speaker 0: That is not plausible to a normal person mm-hmm, and they don't have the right level of Skepticism.

785
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:09,432
Speaker 0: like the kids watch blade and suddenly are freaking out about vampires.

786
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:11,118
Speaker 0: Yeah that tracks that.

787
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:11,680
Speaker 0: that makes sense

788
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:15,857
Speaker 1: But except they don't realize that the kids watch they studied the blade

789
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:31,924
Speaker 0: after I Liked how Most of the vampires were like super stereotypical Like what we do in the shadows vampire vampires to like the fact that when the gang bangers come around the corner the vampires are Standing there.

790
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:32,348
Speaker 0: They're just like.

791
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:33,459
Speaker 0: what the fuck?

792
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,547
Speaker 0: What is wrong with you?

793
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:36,553
Speaker 0: Who are you?

794
00:53:36,573 --> 00:53:37,639
Speaker 0: What's going on here?

795
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:38,761
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

796
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:47,250
Speaker 1: I did really appreciate the clever plot point where they managed to combine The gentrification storyline with the vampire storyline.

797
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:56,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, the vampires were buying the real estate and So that they could enter without being invited because if they own the property then you don't have to invite them in.

798
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:58,559
Speaker 0: it's their property like literally I'm the landlord now.

799
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:00,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was like.

800
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:02,460
Speaker 1: that was just a really clever way.

801
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,771
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you wanted to tell these two stories.

802
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:22,280
Speaker 1: one is a metaphor for the other but also Combining it with the actual vampire, you know mythos and mythology that way was extra clever and I think really, you know Even though it was only briefly mentioned It's it was kind of huge and really tied the whole thing together like oh that explains everything and it's really clever.

803
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:22,700
Speaker 1: That's good.

804
00:54:23,162 --> 00:54:35,545
Speaker 0: But also the moment where I knew from the beginning that one rich guy was just they're familiar Like that was that was check out obvious bias the fact that when the kids confront him They're like yo the fuck you.

805
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,990
Speaker 0: What do you think the endgame is to this?

806
00:54:37,492 --> 00:54:42,499
Speaker 0: and he's like, yeah, you're right like That was a cool moment that I did not expect.

807
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,870
Speaker 1: That was another cool moment of you know.

808
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,400
Speaker 1: adults like listening to the kids and common sense.

809
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:54,600
Speaker 1: Right as opposed to in most horror movies people just you know, denying the truth acting irrationally and causing more trouble, right?

810
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,636
Speaker 1: It's like, you know people said things straight up to other people and the people that heard it.

811
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:02,046
Speaker 1: they heard it and they were like Oh, that's right.

812
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:08,409
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, once the there was enough evidence to Support what was being said, you know people listen to reason.

813
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,080
Speaker 0: the only beat we missed that we should have had was the girl who?

814
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:14,120
Speaker 0: Already knew how to fight vampires.

815
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,213
Speaker 0: We should have seen her take at least one vampire out like that was.

816
00:55:19,635 --> 00:55:21,200
Speaker 0: that was a moment that needed to happen.

817
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,880
Speaker 1: She needed a moment exactly like the first person that believes the kid.

818
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:33,267
Speaker 1: Well, the second person that believes the kids right is this girl who you know, totally believes them My grandma's Haitian.

819
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:33,508
Speaker 0: I've been.

820
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:36,502
Speaker 0: she's been preparing me for this shit my whole life Right.

821
00:55:36,522 --> 00:55:37,726
Speaker 1: It's like she knew everything.

822
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:38,689
Speaker 1: She was ready to like.

823
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:43,458
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, Van Helsing appears suddenly and What does she do though?

824
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:53,660
Speaker 0: Right, all she ends up doing is leaving this the the Fight to go and collect the community and bring them back.

825
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,473
Speaker 1: It's like she should have been the one you know to lay down some hammer right.

826
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:00,779
Speaker 0: at least one hammer like one, right?

827
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:02,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, she wasn't a mate.

828
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,600
Speaker 1: shows the side character.

829
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:08,160
Speaker 1: So you can't be like, you know having her, you know, take all the glory right from the main characters.

830
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:10,399
Speaker 0: There was at least another sum.

831
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:16,520
Speaker 0: When they they the two other scenes that are like one-to-one mapping with the Lost Boys.

832
00:56:16,782 --> 00:56:19,700
Speaker 0: The Lost Boys has a scene where the kids are like, all right, let's do the smart thing.

833
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:28,006
Speaker 0: Let's go into their fucking nest during the day and kill him because they can't get us and it fails because of you know they're not actually ready for this.

834
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:37,752
Speaker 0: that scene is almost the exact same scene from the Lost Boys and the scene where they kill him with where they kill a vampire with the The communion wafer is.

835
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:41,872
Speaker 0: Also, there's a scene where they kill a vampire with a stereo.

836
00:56:41,912 --> 00:56:44,200
Speaker 0: that was staged very similarly in the Lost Boys.

837
00:56:44,603 --> 00:56:49,354
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of little mappings like that But the other beat from the only beach from the Lost Boys.

838
00:56:49,394 --> 00:56:50,479
Speaker 0: I expected that didn't happen.

839
00:56:51,243 --> 00:57:01,427
Speaker 0: I really thought there was going to be a scene at the very end where the priest comes in again like at the end after they beat all the vampires sees them all and Said something like man.

840
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:05,301
Speaker 0: I moved to the Bronx to get away from all those fucking vampires Like.

841
00:57:05,341 --> 00:57:13,696
Speaker 0: I expected that because that has been a post climax scene in multiple vampire movies over the years Not just the Lost Boys, but other movies, too.

842
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:20,879
Speaker 0: Mmm, you know at the end where the vampire with our grandpa's just like, you know I moved to San Dimas to get away from all those vampires.

843
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:24,720
Speaker 0: Or no, what's the problem with San Dimas too many fucking vampires?

844
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,065
Speaker 0: So it's not actually San Dimas.

845
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:32,206
Speaker 0: It's just I've had Bill and Ted on the mind for reasons to yeah But yeah, what else?

846
00:57:32,226 --> 00:57:56,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're looking for if you're looking for a fun Way to spend you know, uh your Halloween watching right your your your stay at home socially distanced internet Halloween party or you know, just your Halloween tradition and you just you know, you want to get that same feeling that you get from all your traditional You know fun Halloween party movies, you know Uh, and you just want to.

847
00:57:56,345 --> 00:57:58,832
Speaker 1: but you also just want to see something new right?

848
00:57:58,872 --> 00:58:00,236
Speaker 1: Not the same old over again.

849
00:58:00,256 --> 00:58:05,920
Speaker 1: This is Perfect, right just put it up there in that same pantheon where all the rest, you know.

850
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,979
Speaker 1: And I think actually, you know, it's like, you know for years to come, right?

851
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,976
Speaker 1: I see no reason why this shouldn't be considered along with the others like oh, it's Halloween.

852
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:16,903
Speaker 1: We're traditional movie Are we gonna watch?

853
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:18,350
Speaker 1: it's on the list with all the other ones.

854
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,530
