1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,037
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 9th.

2
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:12,141
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:17,542
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight Watchmen.

4
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:26,619
Speaker 0: Let's do this Well over the weekend.

5
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,749
Speaker 0: Thanks to Emily getting tickets for me.

6
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:33,090
Speaker 0: I got to go see brave story in the theater, but we already saw it in the house.

7
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:38,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what the movie is pretty enough to where it was really worth seeing it again Just to see it in the theater.

8
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,363
Speaker 0: That is a really beautiful movie.

9
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:41,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was alright.

10
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:45,149
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, you're about just about everything so I don't really consider your opinion.

11
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:48,963
Speaker 1: It says the person who hates 99% of everything there is.

12
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, particularly comic books.

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,647
Speaker 1: I think I think the difference is that you either hate something or like you like it.

14
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,937
Speaker 0: No No, I have very man.

15
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:00,670
Speaker 0: I have a very wide range of feelings on many things.

16
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,319
Speaker 1: Oh, you seem to either be like that sucks or that's awesome.

17
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:05,446
Speaker 1: And I seem to be man on almost everything.

18
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,369
Speaker 1: No, not really.

19
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:08,630
Speaker 1: What do you man about?

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,677
Speaker 0: most things Really Yeah, most anime that come I just ate.

21
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:14,059
Speaker 0: I just ate.

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,762
Speaker 0: I just don't like it.

23
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:18,033
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't seem to always say me Well, what do you mean?

24
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:20,124
Speaker 0: I may isn't something you have to say?

25
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:21,410
Speaker 0: may is the default opinion?

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's what it is Is that you sort of only express the.

27
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:27,083
Speaker 0: I don't express a non opinion.

28
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:32,750
Speaker 0: if I watch a show that's kind of boring like skull Man, I say huh and I just don't react to it because I have nothing to say.

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:38,446
Speaker 0: I think I think a middling opinion is is an opinion, but it is an opinion But I don't express it because there's no reason to.

30
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:45,449
Speaker 0: Besides the point is I think brave story is a great movie and I highly recommend that anyone out there who likes anime see it.

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:53,378
Speaker 0: Also, I will note that while the movie and the dub was pretty piss-poor.

32
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:54,800
Speaker 0: I gotta say really.

33
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:57,780
Speaker 1: But then you seem like a movie that was hard to dub either.

34
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,915
Speaker 0: No I expected it to be a pretty and it and it and it seemed okay.

35
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:18,038
Speaker 0: at first until Until I started hearing more than pretty much from him on Every single character's voice actor sounded like they were yelling all the time Regardless of whether or not the person on screen was yelling everyone's voice was either gravelly or mealy.

36
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:28,986
Speaker 0: so the dog basically sounds like They was that kind of movie.

37
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:30,189
Speaker 0: no, it was.

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,140
Speaker 0: so far it was so cheesy in the dub and the dialogue itself.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,923
Speaker 0: Isn't that cheesy?

40
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:37,411
Speaker 0: It's just the way it was dubbed in the way.

41
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,080
Speaker 0: They decided to do it was really bad.

42
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:43,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could definitely see how that could be.

43
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:52,264
Speaker 0: However Especially with that circus scene Even if you end up seeing the dub if you can catch this movie in a theater as opposed to just on the bit Torrance I'd recommend it.

44
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:59,071
Speaker 1: It's definitely worth watching this movie once if you can But you know, it's not the best thing ever of course.

45
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:13,904
Speaker 0: more importantly while we were in the city There is a dish a culinary sensation a thing that I've never actually had before but I knew of the existence by name only and I knew it was Canadian and Particularly Quebecois.

46
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:17,395
Speaker 0: and finally also Emily decided to buy some for me.

47
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:31,766
Speaker 0: I had put in Alright, it's basically a cup filled with super fat french fries gravy chicken in bits cheese Curds and Pretty much awesome wonderfulness.

48
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:33,873
Speaker 1: So it's just a heart attack in a cup.

49
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:35,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, it had to be at least 800 calories.

50
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:38,310
Speaker 0: Alright, it was so awesome.

51
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,140
Speaker 0: I think I have a new favorite food.

52
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,752
Speaker 1: I think I'll just stay away from that for the sake of my arteries.

53
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,437
Speaker 0: It was almost as good as a White Castle.

54
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,344
Speaker 0: Ah Disgusting.

55
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:49,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I don't know what your problem is with White Castle.

56
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:51,959
Speaker 0: Those are quality little burgers for what you pay.

57
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:58,320
Speaker 0: In fact, if you take into account the price versus the unit quality It's probably the best deal on food in the world.

58
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,864
Speaker 1: It's pretty bad.

59
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:03,840
Speaker 1: If I was a starving person in Africa, maybe I'd eat a White Castle.

60
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:12,547
Speaker 0: But other than that, no, dude when I was growing up in sterling heights White Castle and Taco Bell were banned from sterling heights due to very good reason.

61
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:16,197
Speaker 0: so so and also White Castles were hard to find up there.

62
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:24,940
Speaker 0: we ended up fairly often in high school getting a big group of people together crammed into a car and Drive in a half hour just to get to the one White Castle we could find.

63
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,488
Speaker 0: That was smart and by in sex.

64
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,920
Speaker 1: you couldn't have possibly spent that money in time in any better way.

65
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,840
Speaker 0: What money guess cost practically nothing back then and the burgers cost less?

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, but imagine if you added up all them together, you know what.

67
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:49,578
Speaker 0: you could have gotten a one video game Which is better than all the White Castles now because those White Castle trips while not quite a Harold and Kumar level were generally minor defining moments in my childhood.

68
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:54,514
Speaker 0: You know kids in some places go down to the levee but the levee was dry.

69
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,120
Speaker 0: well we drove out to White Castle.

70
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:59,200
Speaker 1: We just went to the diner where we had decent food.

71
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,938
Speaker 1: Oh, we went to the diner to buy onion rings by the foot.

72
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:07,221
Speaker 0: See we went to the Coney Island diners where I could get an entire meal for a dollar 99.

73
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:11,979
Speaker 1: We went to the real diner where you'd get a stack of pancakes for $6 real diner.

74
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,240
Speaker 0: What?

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:22,993
Speaker 0: Yeah real diner now with real food that is good and edible and dude compared to some places in Michigan in the Midwest or Pretty much anywhere on the Jersey Shore or pretty much anywhere in New Jersey.

76
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:24,740
Speaker 0: You don't have any diners in Connecticut.

77
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,079
Speaker 1: There's diners in Connecticut.

78
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,007
Speaker 1: What do you know?

79
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,612
Speaker 1: how many diners in Connecticut have you eaten it?

80
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 1: Oh, which one I don't even know.

81
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,559
Speaker 0: But I stopped at two different diners.

82
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:38,911
Speaker 0: Remember all those times I end up stopping at your house on the way home from a con or something Way back when I lived out here alone.

83
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:42,738
Speaker 0: every time I left your house I'd always stop at some diner along the way to eat.

84
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:47,480
Speaker 1: Oh the diners that are on the way to here from my parents house and not the best ones in, Connecticut.

85
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,696
Speaker 1: Okay, the good ones is a good one in Westport and there's a good one in Fairfield.

86
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:54,000
Speaker 0: and see when I'm in Jersey?

87
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,311
Speaker 0: I don't need to ask that question.

88
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,300
Speaker 0: I just go to any diner.

89
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,587
Speaker 1: Well, New Jersey does have better diners than Connecticut.

90
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:02,017
Speaker 1: But regardless Connecticut has better diners than Michigan.

91
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:05,870
Speaker 0: I'm just a. Michigan has really good Greek food surprisingly.

92
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,220
Speaker 0: There's a lot of Greeks in Michigan into southeast Michigan.

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're not diner Greek there, you know shawarma falafel place.

94
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:13,819
Speaker 0: No, they're they're all diner Greek.

95
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,336
Speaker 0: There's very little shawarma falafel out there.

96
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:19,287
Speaker 1: Yeah Great besides the best diners.

97
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:20,912
Speaker 1: while they may offer great Greek food.

98
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:23,620
Speaker 1: I'll usually have to offer non Greek food as well.

99
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:29,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, sadly most diners they go to now don't have great Greek food and they just kind of have mad diner food.

100
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:34,597
Speaker 1: You got to go to diners like the Athena something something or the out Zeus something.

101
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:38,432
Speaker 0: Olympus diner What's the one we go to in Wildwood the star diner?

102
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:39,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that one's a pretty good diner.

103
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:40,420
Speaker 1: It's a good diner.

104
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best diner I've ever eaten is the tick-tock diner in Jersey.

105
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,740
Speaker 0: Ah Anyway in the news, it's really not much of a news and I had something else.

106
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,240
Speaker 0: But I just found this kind of funny when Scott clicked on it while we were sitting in the living room.

107
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:58,740
Speaker 0: There's a poll on the anime news network and the poll is do you read?

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,855
Speaker 1: Protoculture for the culture addicts.

109
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:03,525
Speaker 1: Ah Protoculture addicts is a magazine.

110
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:04,749
Speaker 1: It is the oldest.

111
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,370
Speaker 0: Wait.

112
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,514
Speaker 0: Wait a magazine.

113
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's what kind of thing is that?

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
Speaker 1: It's it's sort of like this paper that they stick together and write shit.

115
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:14,399
Speaker 1: It's like someone prints out a web page and they try to sell it to you.

116
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:15,986
Speaker 0: Oh, I've seen those.

117
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,130
Speaker 0: they cost a lot of money.

118
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,355
Speaker 0: The pages are all glossy.

119
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:19,640
Speaker 0: They're more ads than content.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, those things.

121
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,024
Speaker 1: Yeah those things.

122
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:29,373
Speaker 1: so protoculture addicts is the oldest anime magazine in the United States and surprisingly enough There have been a lot of anime magazines the United States in English.

123
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of them were pretty bad.

124
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:32,366
Speaker 1: Well, some of them were good.

125
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,230
Speaker 1: Some of them were bad.

126
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,781
Speaker 1: I'm you know, some of them were manga, you know They were.

127
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:43,578
Speaker 1: they tried they were like manga anthologies and some of them were just actual magazines about anime with anime news and ads and stuff like that.

128
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,220
Speaker 1: and Some of them have failed and some of them are still around in various forms and whatever.

129
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,919
Speaker 1: Protoculture addicts is the oldest one.

130
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:58,099
Speaker 1: It's still around and I think in 2005 they teamed up with the anime news network in a bid to stay alive And they are still alive.

131
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:02,740
Speaker 0: Well for now because this poll pretty much went exactly the way I expected.

132
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:09,140
Speaker 0: You see Scott clicked on the poll because we saw the poll and we both don't really read magazines anymore at all.

133
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,873
Speaker 1: Maybe if I'm in a dentist office and I forgot my DS.

134
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:16,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm in the waiting room So never because you always have your DS exactly.

135
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,475
Speaker 0: maybe the battery went down.

136
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:18,600
Speaker 1: maybe I don't know.

137
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, the dentist made me wait all day.

138
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:29,174
Speaker 0: But I mean the last magazines I bought or subscribe to were dragon magazine Which I realized after six years of subscribing that it was useless.

139
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:29,937
Speaker 0: Yep.

140
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:30,800
Speaker 0: I was like one day.

141
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,620
Speaker 0: I was like, why do I subscribe to this?

142
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:36,020
Speaker 0: I only kind of read through it briefly and then I stick it in the pile.

143
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:44,816
Speaker 0: And it's a lot of money and I'll talk about new type in a minute, but So Scott clicks on the pole and there's a million possible answer.

144
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:48,754
Speaker 1: I thought it was gonna be yes No, but no there were like 20 different answers to choose from.

145
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,799
Speaker 0: so Scott's sitting there going.

146
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:54,193
Speaker 1: I was just looking for the answer that I knew was the one I wanted.

147
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:59,520
Speaker 0: now meanwhile because I guess I have the rim I when it comes to rim and Scott opinions while I was reading from top to bottom.

148
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:05,498
Speaker 0: Yeah I just zeroed in on the option that pretty much says exactly how I was sure Scott would feel.

149
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:06,040
Speaker 0: quote.

150
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:10,052
Speaker 0: I don't read any anime print magazines nor do I intend to.

151
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,460
Speaker 1: that is the correct answer to the question.

152
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,160
Speaker 1: Do you read Protoculture Addicts?

153
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,395
Speaker 0: Well that answer is definitely winning the poll and I point out the wallet is winning.

154
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:23,400
Speaker 0: number three is What is Protoculture Addicts?

155
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:29,597
Speaker 1: If they want me to read their anime magazine, they are going to have a number.

156
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:35,980
Speaker 1: Oh god They're gonna have to find some way to basically make it illegal to put anime news on the internet for free.

157
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,230
Speaker 0: See in general.

158
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:41,306
Speaker 0: I think that most Magazines now there are exceptions.

159
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,032
Speaker 0: I I'm not gonna go in it.

160
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:45,640
Speaker 0: I mean there are magazines that do serve useful purposes.

161
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,605
Speaker 0: There are also things like journals and such.

162
00:09:48,107 --> 00:10:01,027
Speaker 0: but when it comes to things like anime or video games or anything like that I really think that this thing called the internet has Obviated the need for this entire market and I can't believe it still exists.

163
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:05,258
Speaker 0: who gets their opinions on Video games from a video game magazine?

164
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:08,950
Speaker 1: someone who doesn't know how to read penny arcade Kotaku or joystick?

165
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:16,845
Speaker 0: I mean if anything the best case unless they've employed nothing But actual psychics which if they did I would probably subscribe.

166
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:23,446
Speaker 0: Yep, but There's no way they could beat the internet to any news because they have to print.

167
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:24,670
Speaker 0: meaning there is a point.

168
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:39,512
Speaker 0: Well before you get the magazine whereupon they had to say Alright this is as up-to-date as this issue is going to be because now we are going to kill a bunch of trees Put a bunch of ink on it put it in plastic and make a bunch of people drive around the country putting them in people's Mailboxes.

169
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,847
Speaker 1: Yeah now even if a magazine does have a couple advantages.

170
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:55,490
Speaker 1: number one They can get information because they're you know real media, you know as opposed to underground internet media They can go and get exclusives from the source that they won't tell to a blog.

171
00:10:55,652 --> 00:11:03,630
Speaker 1: So for example Nintendo power they know things that no Nintendo blog knows about and they can put those things in their magazines.

172
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:07,350
Speaker 1: So if you want to find out first You'd have to get you have to subscribe to the magazine.

173
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:14,030
Speaker 1: The problem is as soon as that magazine comes out someone types in what the hell it says and I find out five minutes later.

174
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,655
Speaker 1: Yep, not a big deal.

175
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:16,216
Speaker 0: Plus.

176
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:28,693
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people say oh, yeah blogs are real journalism, but you can't really Deny them outright because as time goes along that sort of media is becoming more and more legitimate and Legitimate.

177
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:32,950
Speaker 0: people out there are starting to pay attention to them and give their press releases to blog.

178
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:42,881
Speaker 1: Yep Despite the fact that any video game blog the average video game blog I'd say is 50% complete bullshit rumor-mongering and 50% just video game stuff.

179
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:57,270
Speaker 1: despite that fact Which I can't deny by reading video game blogs and pretty much nothing else about video games I get more information about video games than I ever got subscribing to GamePro and I know when all the games are coming out.

180
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,380
Speaker 1: I know which games are good.

181
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,390
Speaker 1: I know which games are bad.

182
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:12,080
Speaker 1: I know all about Xbox teams even though I don't have one and don't care and I know that all sorts of stuff is going on and it works regardless of the crappiness of the quality in general.

183
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:18,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I used to subscribe to PC gamer and Back then there really wasn't an internet like there is today.

184
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:28,570
Speaker 0: So I needed something like that to find out about PC games And you got the demo CDs because you couldn't download giant demos like that Which were basically free games because by the time I got done playing the demos.

185
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:32,230
Speaker 0: You didn't want to play the game anymore now because either the game was dumb or it was awesome.

186
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,729
Speaker 0: But oh look the next set of demos came out.

187
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:36,657
Speaker 0: I mean I played that one must fall.

188
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,324
Speaker 0: 2097 demo for like.

189
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:42,339
Speaker 1: oh, I played that so much You have no idea by the time I finished playing the demo.

190
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,442
Speaker 0: I didn't.

191
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:44,907
Speaker 0: I don't think you could actually purchase.

192
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:45,850
Speaker 0: one must fall anymore.

193
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:47,075
Speaker 1: I think that was the.

194
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:49,304
Speaker 1: well you can get it for free now, but well now you can.

195
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:53,410
Speaker 0: and what we should talk about that Someday, that's one of my favorite fighting games ever.

196
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that is one of the best fighting.

197
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:58,973
Speaker 0: pretty much that in Bushido blade - I don't like Bushido blade You suck.

198
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:00,741
Speaker 1: I like the idea Bushido blade now.

199
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:02,770
Speaker 0: I've never actually read Protoculture Addict.

200
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,070
Speaker 0: So if anyone could think of any reason why I should I'll hear you out.

201
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:11,454
Speaker 0: But I would like to mention New Type magazine Which I'm not.

202
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:20,230
Speaker 0: I can't speak as to how cool or interesting Protoculture might be But the story of New Type magazine because remember used to at least our interaction with you.

203
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it used to not be in English, but all the cool kids had the Japanese new types.

204
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:26,390
Speaker 0: You'd buy him at cons.

205
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,960
Speaker 0: You'd see him around people would carry him to the anime club.

206
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,650
Speaker 1: people at the anime club would subscribe to the Japanese new.

207
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,541
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact at the RIT anime club we had the library.

208
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:36,690
Speaker 0: we could check out anime and manga and all sorts of things.

209
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:43,510
Speaker 0: You know we had God hundreds and hundreds thousands of tapes tapes tapes hundreds of tapes not thousands.

210
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,900
Speaker 0: Well, we broke a thousand during our time thousands.

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,622
Speaker 1: That would be at least 2,000.

212
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:54,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah well thousands of Tapes because we also had the tape right.

213
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:59,614
Speaker 1: yeah If you count every centimeter of duct tape as one tape yeah Yeah, anyway,

214
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:09,546
Speaker 0: anyway, we had a lot of tapes a lot all that stuff and not only could you check out New Type magazine But a lot of people did and it was in Japanese and when I first opened a new type.

215
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:14,098
Speaker 1: It's gigantic and Beautiful it's like you in Japanese.

216
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:20,030
Speaker 1: New Type is the greatest magazine ever to an English-speaking person because it has these amazing pictures of all these anime.

217
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:25,109
Speaker 1: They and you can kind of figure out like when they're coming out or if they're good or not and what they're about

218
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,762
Speaker 0: and they'll Have character profiles and all these shots and pictures and beautiful fold outs

219
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:37,090
Speaker 1: all sorts of extras like showing you the characters from every Angle and every character in the whole show even the minor characters and all the robots and all the weapons.

220
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:44,959
Speaker 1: And it's pretty freakin cool to be able to you know because usually you watch an anime everything's moving Stuff doesn't stay on the screen very long at the angle.

221
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,284
Speaker 1: so a new type.

222
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:53,770
Speaker 1: you can look at the characters That you know and really look at him for a long time and inspect them, and it was pretty cool.

223
00:14:54,171 --> 00:15:03,784
Speaker 0: I read well quotes in the air read New Type every month for like five months when it was in Japanese And I can't read Japanese at all me also.

224
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:10,730
Speaker 0: all I could think was that Goddamn if this was in English would be the best thing ever because I was entertained enough by the pictures.

225
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:17,150
Speaker 0: But I saw all this Japanese words, and I knew that those words were telling me interesting things.

226
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,510
Speaker 1: So what was it Otakon?

227
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:22,050
Speaker 0: First or second Otakon?

228
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:24,690
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look it up all that it was years ago.

229
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,870
Speaker 0: It was back when I was poor because I couldn't afford to subscribe to New Type and in fact I ended up subscribing anyway.

230
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,949
Speaker 0: And then I got a bunch of issues, and then they stopped sending him to me when I didn't pay.

231
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:43,427
Speaker 1: yeah So this must have been Otakon 2002. they hand it out in the dealer's room because ADV does the New Type USA.

232
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:49,168
Speaker 1: They handed out free issues of New Type USA number zero which had Raza fine on the cover.

233
00:15:49,489 --> 00:16:02,577
Speaker 0: now Much like when Sailor Moon finally sees behind tuxedo masks mask and find out that He's actually that guy I like or that guy I don't like or whatever New types mask fell off.

234
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:11,087
Speaker 0: as I could now read all those previously mythical words and That's not going to much more detail because I want to get done with the news it was drivel.

235
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:13,374
Speaker 0: it was Absolute drivel.

236
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:16,865
Speaker 0: there was no reason to ever look into a new type again.

237
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,510
Speaker 1: those words were meaningless.

238
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when New Type USA came out.

239
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:21,970
Speaker 1: I got a few of the issues.

240
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,729
Speaker 1: I did you buy him or did I buy him?

241
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,592
Speaker 0: I got.

242
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:25,698
Speaker 0: I just said how I got him.

243
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:27,989
Speaker 0: I didn't pay for him and eventually they stopped sending him to me.

244
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,398
Speaker 1: Alright right you said it's a subscription card.

245
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,245
Speaker 1: They sent you a few issues, but you never paid the $75.

246
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:35,834
Speaker 1: yeah the $75 a year right.

247
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:41,370
Speaker 1: so at those first early New Type USA's I read them, but I didn't read the words.

248
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:42,476
Speaker 1: I read them the same way.

249
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:43,481
Speaker 1: I read the Japanese one.

250
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,270
Speaker 1: I looked at the pictures, and then I put it away.

251
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, room was in the magazine once though.

252
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,530
Speaker 0: I was in fact myself and Scott Johnson were in New Type.

253
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:59,819
Speaker 0: We were featured in this page thing about the pretty much the legendary Scott Johnson was actually called the legendary club anime club Master or something to that effect.

254
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,181
Speaker 0: I forget.

255
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,427
Speaker 0: I've got the issue laying around.

256
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:05,545
Speaker 0: yep In fact I should scan it in and post a picture of it because my ego is so big.

257
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:12,108
Speaker 0: and the awesome Awesome thing was that it mentioned Scott Johnson a few times, but all the pictures were of me.

258
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:13,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's only one picture.

259
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,502
Speaker 0: No there were two.

260
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:15,045
Speaker 1: was there.

261
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:23,307
Speaker 0: there were at least two I don't remember cuz I had two different angles and both of them clearly I'm the one speaking and I'm the one centered, but Scott got the legendary title, so I couldn't really.

262
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:27,200
Speaker 1: yeah I don't think I don't remember anyway.

263
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:27,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

264
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:28,966
Speaker 0: We talked to the guy afterward.

265
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,090
Speaker 0: He's like ah shit.

266
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't really put all the effort.

267
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:33,690
Speaker 0: I should have into that article.

268
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:35,598
Speaker 1: It's a tiny article that no one read.

269
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:36,100
Speaker 1: so who cares?

270
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,430
Speaker 0: well no one reads anything in New Type because it's garbage.

271
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,656
Speaker 1: Yep, all the magazines are garbage.

272
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:46,090
Speaker 0: well particularly New Type because I've actually read it and the words there was so little substance.

273
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:50,167
Speaker 0: It was like I knew less about the anime than when I started.

274
00:17:50,187 --> 00:18:03,762
Speaker 1: I remember I also bought a couple issues of like anime insider Which is like the wizard anime magazine and that was I don't I dare say it was worse than wizard magazine Which is Wow one of the worst magazines ever.

275
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:08,057
Speaker 1: hey remember scry God I've had a few of those.

Speaker 1: I don't know if he was speaking Portuguese, but he must had a train.

291
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:49,467
Speaker 0: Oh, he's fluent in Portuguese.

292
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,170
Speaker 1: is he really?

293
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:51,648
Speaker 0: I have no idea either.

294
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,474
Speaker 1: He didn't interview.

295
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:57,490
Speaker 1: the interview is in Portuguese, and then it was translated from Portuguese to English.

296
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:07,750
Speaker 1: You can read this interview with Satoshi khan And if you thought he was a genius based upon his artistic works You will think he is a double genius based upon his interview.

297
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:20,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the point I would make is that when it comes to things that are awesome and the people that make them Sometimes something is awesome Despite the person who made it and sometimes something is awesome because of the person who made it.

298
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:25,347
Speaker 1: Let's see Star Wars case of the former Harlan Ellison case of the former.

299
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,835
Speaker 0: yes The latter I mean you'll.

300
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:35,890
Speaker 0: there's a lot of complexity to the things he's made and you get the impression that that was all intentional.

301
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,707
Speaker 0: Entirely like he puts a lot of thought into the works.

302
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,386
Speaker 0: He does Cosmo coke.

303
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,369
Speaker 0: Now also I would like to do a geek back.

304
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:58,097
Speaker 0: No Because we haven't done geek backs in a while, but their whole episode of one yeah But I mean that was wasn't really a geek bag.

305
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:02,894
Speaker 0: that was more of a episode on the future of geek nights that we foiled With the question.

306
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:05,182
Speaker 0: someone asked it wasn't like a geek bag stuck into a show.

307
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:13,813
Speaker 0: all right and partly because we've been asking a lot Of people to send us a lot of feedback and a lot of you have the people coming out of the woodwork and actually Talking to us.

308
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:18,896
Speaker 0: You're all awesome because you have already moved beyond consumer and become Interactor.

309
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,790
Speaker 0: you're one step away from producer.

310
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:31,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've talked about this before and that for any given work of art or media or whatever 90% of the people just observe or consume that work.

311
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,486
Speaker 1: 10% of people interact with that work.

312
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:42,763
Speaker 1: That's a hundred percent and You get the idea and then 1% of people You know actually produce works.

313
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:47,366
Speaker 1: yes, so Most people listening to this podcast nine to about 90% of you.

314
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,781
Speaker 1: All you do is listen to this podcast.

Speaker 1: You don't do anything now.

321
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,546
Speaker 0: I understand that some of you probably do something out there.

322
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:03,349
Speaker 0: We're not talking to you.

323
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:11,483
Speaker 0: I mean if you're crazily active unlike the comic geek speak forums or something We don't expect you to also be crazily active with us.

324
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:17,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, but some people out there You're just listening to geek nights not doing anything else, and you know what I say to you You're in the 90%.

325
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:18,337
Speaker 1: is that cool.

326
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:18,398
Speaker 1: No.

327
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:19,583
Speaker 1: It's not so cool.

328
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:30,059
Speaker 1: You want to move into the 10% then you'll be in the 90th percentile better than most people as opposed to just being Most people plus.

329
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,467
Speaker 0: I will point out that if you like geek nights Which you must because you're listening I'll point this is your first time.

330
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:35,910
Speaker 1: What's up?

331
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:49,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you might hate it which is fine but if you go to our forums pretty much everyone in there thinks along the same lines you do and I really think that our forums are some of the better forums on the internet, and I'm not just kidding about that.

332
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,389
Speaker 1: Well you if you want to be cool and like rim and scott you should wait wait a minute.

333
00:21:55,971 --> 00:22:01,310
Speaker 0: We're using peer pressure in order to tell people to resist the bandwagon.

334
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:06,450
Speaker 0: Yes, we're trying to get you off of one bandwagon under another bandwagon, but we're not lying to you.

335
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,930
Speaker 1: We're actually trying to help you out and move you to the superior bandwagon.

336
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:13,662
Speaker 1: So anyway of not being the sheep, but being the sheep dog.

337
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:18,607
Speaker 0: ah sheep dog because the next step up is the shepherd Which is really hard to be except where the shepherds.

338
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:26,136
Speaker 0: well I guess the step up from that is the pirate in The post-apocalyptic fist of the North Star world who kills the shepherd then kills the sheep.

339
00:22:26,277 --> 00:22:39,740
Speaker 0: That's also me Anyway, so a while ago We did an episode on the worst podcast ever and we called out a bunch of podcasts and somebody's still doing the geek bag.

340
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:56,760
Speaker 0: yeah, and some of those podcasts responded to us and Not too long ago one of the hosts of anime world order had a crazy Hissy fit about something Scott said and That was hilarious, and I realized something and this feedback is going to really put in the relief for you.

341
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,307
Speaker 0: I'll read the feedback first.

342
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,353
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what I learned from it.

343
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:00,720
Speaker 0: This is from one sin.

344
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:05,181
Speaker 0: I first heard about geek nights from anime world order during a con report I think.

345
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:11,060
Speaker 0: then after the whole Clarissa to terror thing I began to consider giving geek nights a shot.

346
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:12,668
Speaker 0: I finally subscribed.

347
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,940
Speaker 0: after listening to the worst podcast episode.

348
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:23,040
Speaker 0: I found out about it from some anime pulse fans who were Indignant and whatnot over how badly their precious show got owned.

349
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:27,373
Speaker 0: I figure anyone decent decent enough to see through that show was worth listening to.

350
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:35,380
Speaker 0: now the moral of this story Is that the more anyone out there puts the hate on us the more listeners we get?

351
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,340
Speaker 0: Because this isn't the first time I've gotten a feedback like this.

352
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:47,780
Speaker 0: I've gotten at least I'm not gonna exaggerate here one two I've gotten six or seven emails or feedbacks that basically said yeah, I found your show because someone said you sucked.

353
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,940
Speaker 1: So if anyone out there still believes that there's a such thing as bad publicity you're wrong.

354
00:23:54,127 --> 00:24:02,020
Speaker 1: Yes This is why part of the reason why we are one of the few pot it seems like a lot of podcasts are just afraid To be critical especially of other podcasts.

355
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:11,060
Speaker 1: This is why we fear nothing and we'll say whatever the hell we want Because number one will be known as the podcast that says whatever the hell we want which makes I think makes us a better podcast.

356
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:14,777
Speaker 1: I think so and two will occasionally get bad publicity, which is good.

357
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:17,923
Speaker 0: Yes So one sin, thanks for joining the forums.

358
00:24:17,943 --> 00:24:18,685
Speaker 0: It's good to have you here.

359
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:26,718
Speaker 0: things of the day.

360
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,000
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be real quick here.

361
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:35,280
Speaker 0: There's a video of a little turtle and a cat and the turtle like a little machine just won't leave that cat alone.

362
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,360
Speaker 0: It's like an attack turtle and it's hilarious.

363
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,752
Speaker 1: I'm not a big fan of animals, but I kind of like that turtle.

364
00:24:40,992 --> 00:24:42,257
Speaker 0: I really like turtles for one.

365
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:42,860
Speaker 0: I think they're cute.

366
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:46,918
Speaker 1: I like the way its arms and legs move because they're kind of like backwards C's and they kind of.

367
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:49,867
Speaker 0: And that's not just a normal turtle.

368
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:52,053
Speaker 0: That is a turtle on a mission Scott.

369
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:53,277
Speaker 1: Why do you care about that turtle?

370
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:53,779
Speaker 1: It's not you.

371
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:07,079
Speaker 1: So for all you people out there especially you Scott bot Who are not too up on the superhero fan culture that is?

372
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:15,780

Speaker 0: So anime world order.

394
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:55,111
Speaker 0: when they talk about an important show or a big show and it's one of those things that they really Care about they always seem to get nervous.

395
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,100
Speaker 0: Like I hope I don't fuck this up.

396
00:25:57,261 --> 00:26:02,700
Speaker 1: I hope I do this show justice and they prepare well in advance and they have a whole bunch of stuff written down.

397
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:12,130
Speaker 0: Well, that is very much how I feel about what we're about to talk about but I have not done any more preparation than I Normally, no, I didn't prepare it all but that is correct.

398
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:14,900
Speaker 1: This is a show that is not to be fucked up.

399
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,420
Speaker 0: Well a show a and yeah, I'd love it to be a show but it isn't yet.

400
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,372
Speaker 1: Well, I meant as this is a show not to be fucked up as in the show.

401
00:26:22,393 --> 00:26:23,116
Speaker 1: We're making right now.

402
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,501
Speaker 0: Oh, okay Okay.

403
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:25,804
Speaker 0: Yes, you saved it.

404
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:26,386
Speaker 0: Good job.

405
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:34,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but tonight we are going to talk about perhaps one of the greatest works in the history of American comics.

406
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:40,240
Speaker 1: It may be perhaps the greatest work of graphic storytelling ever in the history of the world.

407
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:46,759
Speaker 0: It is in the very least a seminal work Watchmen written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Gibbons.

408
00:26:47,181 --> 00:26:49,629
Speaker 1: It is originally I think how many issues?

409
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:52,178
Speaker 0: 12 issues in the mid to late 80s.

410
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:57,778
Speaker 1: Yeah as a 12 issue series of actual comic books printed in the 80s by DC.

411
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:11,356
Speaker 1: and Now you can buy those individual comics if you want you can find them someplace I mean dragons then has them all for like I don't know how much but you or you can be smart and buy One book that has all of them in it for like 20 bucks

412
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,260
Speaker 0: now one.

413
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:18,740
Speaker 0: We are not going to spoil anything in this show because that is a crime worthy of death.

414
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:22,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's not like it's his sled or it's actually a man.

415
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:29,812
Speaker 1: Funny that you say it's his sled because Watchmen is basically the Citizen Kane of comics.

416
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:37,457
Speaker 0: Yes, and we're not kidding here This if you have not read Watchmen, I don't care if you love comic books hate comic books, whatever.

417
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:48,993
Speaker 0: I mean remember I almost entirely dislike the entire genre of comic books involving underwear perverts Superheroes, I don't like the idea of superheroes.

418
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:50,620
Speaker 0: I think the way they're done is often lame.

419
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:53,320
Speaker 0: I consider Watchmen to be one of the best comic books ever.

420
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:53,677
Speaker 0: Yeah

421
00:27:53,921 --> 00:28:08,760
Speaker 1: If you are the kind of person who just only reads manga and you hate American comics if you're the kind of person who hates Comics and think they're for kids and you don't want to read comics at all Everyone who knows how to read and if Watchmen is printed in your language, you should read it.

422
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,810
Speaker 0: Yes, Watchmen is not just a comic book.

423
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,337
Speaker 0: Watchmen is literature.

424
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,866
Speaker 0: I Watchmen is better than a lot of novels.

425
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:15,468
Speaker 0: I have read.

426
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:20,463
Speaker 1: it's probably if on a list of all-time books ever Probably near the.

427
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:32,184
Speaker 0: actually it is the only graphic novel to appear on Time magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. it's really that good.

428
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,539
Speaker 0: So what is the Watchmen?

429
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,325
Speaker 1: The Watchmen is a story.

430
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:42,208
Speaker 1: Let's see.

431
00:28:42,248 --> 00:28:43,070
Speaker 1: How can I put this?

432
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:50,734
Speaker 1: It's about superheroes, but only one of them is actually super yes, and They're sort of retired.

433
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:51,500
Speaker 0: It's more.

434
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:57,600
Speaker 0: Imagine a world very much like our modern world only while the Cold War is still going on.

435
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,109
Speaker 1: So it's an 80s world.

436
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:00,860
Speaker 1: the Cold War is going on.

437
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,480
Speaker 1: Superheroes used to exist, but they don't really anymore.

438
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:05,683
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

439
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:11,259
Speaker 0: imagine if there were superheroes or as they call them a costume heroes or masks in this.

440
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:20,500
Speaker 0: Imagine if in the real world there were superheroes But they were actually just normal people who for whatever reason were very highly skilled or very well-equipped or whatever.

441
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:23,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much every superhero was like Batman.

442
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:38,812
Speaker 0: Just a guy with some gadgets Yes, and not some of the lame Batman, but we're talking about the dark gritty realistic that the good Batman imagine a superhero story that is 100% believable and as Realistic as something like that could ever be and in with one exception.

443
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,677
Speaker 0: It's pretty much straight-up realistic.

444
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:47,260
Speaker 0: Yep, and It said in this slightly alternate history Cold War only a few things are different.

445
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:50,414
Speaker 0: I really don't want to ruin anything but suffice to say imagine it.

446
00:29:50,655 --> 00:30:04,629
Speaker 0: because of these superheroes So America won the Vietnam War and the Soviet Union and the United States the nuclear issue is a little bit more on the forefront and nuclear war is a little bit closer than it ever got in the real world

447
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:05,259
Speaker 1: and

448
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:09,312
Speaker 0: The world's generally a pretty gritty dismal place to be in.

449
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:14,227
Speaker 1: and you have these people who used to be superheroes And they're just living normal lives.

450
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:19,404
Speaker 0: now some of them some of them are doing other things some of them are still superheroes But now they work for the government.

451
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:24,581
Speaker 1: Yep, and one day one of these superheroes a pretty important one is Murdered.

452
00:30:24,902 --> 00:30:38,458
Speaker 0: now actually just a man is murdered in New York and one of his friends Rorschach who was a masked hero in the back in the day And it was still a masked hero despite the fact that they have been outlawed as being vigilantes.

453
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:49,760
Speaker 0: Yep Investigates and discovers that this man who was murdered was actually one of his friend costume heroes the comedian Yep, now it sort of gets Cthulhu on you from there.

454
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,480
Speaker 1: You know how I talked about Call of Cthulhu once on the show.

455
00:30:52,561 --> 00:31:05,822
Speaker 1: I don't know if you listen to that show But it's all about a guy who finds like a bas relief and he starts to investigate and he finds out things he doesn't want to know and shit just gets worse and worse and worse and he wishes he never would have known in the First place.

456
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:10,158
Speaker 0: you found the tip of the iceberg and you have no idea what lies underneath the sea level.

457
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,712
Speaker 1: too bad It's a giant horrible iceberg with a monster frozen in it.

458
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,560
Speaker 1: That'll fuck up your brain or whatever.

459
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:17,987
Speaker 0: Yep, even though unlike Cthulhu.

460
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,255
Speaker 0: This isn't a story of super villains.

461
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:20,656
Speaker 0: calm.

462
00:31:20,716 --> 00:31:26,493
Speaker 0: There's no super villains It's just it's a. it's really hard to describe what it is.

463
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:26,974
Speaker 0: It's really

464
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:43,373
Speaker 1: weird because it's like you think superheroes story All right, so his superhero and this super villain committing a crime and the super the hero has some flaws But he fights through them and learns something and he does a big scene where he beats up the villain and the villain goes to Jail and the superhero goes home having learned his lesson.

465
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:44,498
Speaker 0: It's not like that at all.

466
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,172
Speaker 1: There aren't even in really any combat.

467
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:49,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no fights There's.

468
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,120
Speaker 0: there isn't even really a traditional villain.

469
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,387
Speaker 0: In fact for most of the story.

470
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,260
Speaker 0: you don't even know if anything bad is actually going on.

471
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:06,053
Speaker 1: all you see are these people living their lives and the only bad thing that's happened and the only question you've got is who murdered the comedian and why.

472
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:13,449
Speaker 0: and basically that the story is that Roshach is kind of a Conspiracy nut and a right-wing conspiracy nut.

473
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:21,577
Speaker 0: Yes, and he's kind of crazy and he's definitely crazy Yeah, but at the same time he's one of the most lucid characters in the entire novel.

474
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:24,151
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I'm gonna call it the work from now on.

475
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,640
Speaker 1: Okay, the work the work.

476
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,395
Speaker 1: It is definitely if anything should be called the work.

477
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,140
Speaker 0: this is it?

478
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean here's an example of how well executed is this character.

479
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,200
Speaker 0: Roshach is insane.

480
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:47,372
Speaker 0: He is an insane man who believes in crazy conspiracy theories and he is currently following this conspiracy theory of Regarding the murder of his former friend the comedian and seeing where it will lead him.

481
00:32:47,813 --> 00:32:56,080
Speaker 0: and despite the fact that he's completely insane He is the most lucid character in this entire world and everyone else is just a normal person.

482
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would definitely identify with him.

483
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,780
Speaker 1: second most of all the characters in this book.

484
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:08,498
Speaker 0: I hate to say that I agree with Roshach, but I in the end in most ways do in most ways.

485
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:14,700
Speaker 1: Yes Pretty much because he's the only one who goes in a particular direction, but I'm not gonna spoil any more than that.

486
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:31,980
Speaker 0: Yes, I think it's safe to say that we're not going to talk any more about the plot of Watchmen because there is absolutely no way to talk about it without ruining things or without giving it such a superficial Treatment that you really wouldn't have any idea of actually how good it is.

487
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,958
Speaker 0: So I think instead we're gonna talk a lot about why the Watchmen is good.

488
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,773
Speaker 1: Yes Well first let's talk about the structure of the comic.

489
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,006
Speaker 1: each individual issue Of course has an awesome cover.

490
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,252
Speaker 1: The covers are all amazing.

491
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:45,075
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

492
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:45,837
Speaker 1: I love these covers.

493
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,690
Speaker 1: I can just keep looking at him I'm looking at right now.

494
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,479
Speaker 1: I'm flipping through the book.

495
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:53,113
Speaker 0: Also, I like the every issue ever of the 12 and they're all in the trade.

496
00:33:53,133 --> 00:34:08,498
Speaker 0: paperback obviously begins with a clock That's slowly ticking down to midnight as the comic progresses and despite that now consider that that also There has been the doomsday clock in the real world for the longest time and the doomsday clock exists in this world, too.

497
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:20,315
Speaker 0: It's kind of a bunch of experts Deciding how close the world is to nuclear holocaust at any given moment and depending on the situation of the world They change it and I believe in the setting of the Watchmen.

498
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:25,940
Speaker 0: when Watchmen begins The clock is set to five minutes to midnight with the tension going on in the world at the time.

499
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:33,831
Speaker 1: Yeah If you look at the the top left corner of any of the covers like here chapter one at the first cover of the first Issue of Watchmen in the top left.

500
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:34,739
Speaker 1: There is a clock.

501
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,266
Speaker 1: It's set to about ten to midnight.

502
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,170
Speaker 1: the cover of issue.

503
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:40,375
Speaker 1: Let me flip to one here.

504
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:42,440
Speaker 1: cover of is chapter five.

505
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:56,112
Speaker 1: It's upset at about seven eight minutes to midnight and the final issue The clock on the cover is set to midnight and if the cover is actually a picture of a clock That's like one second away from midnight.

506
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:11,820
Speaker 0: now along with that There's I think I don't know if it's every chapter every issue but I think it is there's always like an abbreviated version of a quote at the beginning and then the Full-quotation at the end and is usually something that sums up in a very elegant way What happened in that issue?

507
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:33,580
Speaker 1: usually the quote will be after the final panel on the final page in the corner like here the the first issue after the Final panel is a small panel on the right that actually also has a clock in it with a time and it says at Midnight all the agents and superhuman crew go out and round up everyone who knows more than they do Bob Dylan.

508
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:41,220
Speaker 1: It's always a quote from something real in the real world like Bob Dylan or an old poem or an old song or me.

509
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:42,400
Speaker 1: I don't know something in the Bible.

510
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,423
Speaker 1: I don't really remember the.

511
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:48,220
Speaker 0: now that sort of thing is often kind of cheesy and hackneyed in a lot of works.

512
00:35:48,300 --> 00:36:00,210
Speaker 0: But in Watchmen, it really is done so well And I don't want to sound pretentious even though I think anyone who uses the word pretentious on the internet Immediately labels themselves as an idiot.

513
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:02,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that word is so useless now.

514
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:15,359
Speaker 0: but the amount of thought that went into choosing these quotations and reading through Watchmen, especially the second time and Looking at these quotations you really understand more and more layers of what was going on in this work.

515
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:18,318
Speaker 0: Another aspect it's called the Watchmen.

516
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:22,630
Speaker 0: The Watchmen in terms of the story doesn't really come up.

517
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:23,914
Speaker 0: There's no group the Watchmen.

518
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,317
Speaker 0: There's no superhero.

519
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:33,640
Speaker 0: the Watchman There's but there's a lot of subtle elements and symbolism that come together Under this name Watchmen, there's a lot of clocks.

520
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:43,119
Speaker 0: in fact One of the superheroes the one who the one person who is actually a superhero who has powers Because of something that happened was a watchmaker.

521
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:46,187
Speaker 0: Clocks are everywhere time and time.

522
00:36:46,228 --> 00:36:48,032
Speaker 0: ticking is always a huge factor in this.

523
00:36:48,313 --> 00:36:52,445
Speaker 1: that quote of who watches the Watchmen just keeps coming Up all over the place.

524
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,534
Speaker 0: quiz custodian is post custodians.

525
00:36:54,895 --> 00:36:55,980
Speaker 0: who will watch the Watchmen?

526
00:36:56,341 --> 00:37:02,479
Speaker 0: It's from a juvenile satire and I know that the rest of that quotation the why it.

527
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,367
Speaker 0: basically Bolterin constrain her, you know talking about someone's wife But who will watch the Watchmen?

528
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,719
Speaker 0: the wife arranges accordingly and begins with them.

529
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:17,919
Speaker 0: The person that you're trying to lock up the person you were fighting against the person you have a Watchmen.

530
00:37:18,441 --> 00:37:29,303
Speaker 0: So a guard to keep an eye on is the first person Who will be attacked or will succumb to the thing you were trying to prevent the thing you were trying to fight And there's.

531
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:34,899
Speaker 0: I really can't say much more about that without ruining elements that are in the story.

532
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:41,108
Speaker 1: now There are two other things I want to talk about the structure of the comic itself that Differentiates it from other American comics.

533
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:47,598
Speaker 1: at the end of every issue after that final panel with the quote there are usually about six pages or so

534
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:47,658
Speaker 0: of

535
00:37:49,060 --> 00:38:02,560
Speaker 1: Text sometimes with some pictures, but it's mostly text and It kind of a lot of people I've noticed like not most people But there are plenty of people out there a scary number of people who do not read this text.

536
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:21,573
Speaker 1: They get to the end of this amazing comic and the six pages of plain old text and they don't want to read it because You know They're used to looking at a picture with a few words in it and then another picture with a few words and they're reading very Quickly and then all of a sudden you're gonna spend just as much time as you spent reading You know 26 pages of comics reading six pages of text.

537
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:26,720
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't want to do that And I understand the feeling but if you don't read it, you're an idiot.

538
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:36,680
Speaker 0: Yes these these things these addenda at the end of each issue are Basically if you take the world that Watchmen is set in and pretend that it's real.

539
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:39,474
Speaker 0: these are primary documents from that world.

540
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:46,272
Speaker 0: one of them will be just a Newspaper article that was published about one of these masked heroes back in the day.

541
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:50,114
Speaker 0: one of them might be the psychological profile of Rorschach.

542
00:38:50,154 --> 00:38:52,366
Speaker 0: that was done by a Psychologist who examined him.

543
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,700
Speaker 0: one of them is just a bunch of poetry and talking about owls.

544
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:04,812
Speaker 1: Yep, and it is very very important that if you read this comic you do not skip over The text at the end of each issue.

545
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:20,040
Speaker 1: it is so ludicrously Futurously important for you to understand what's going on that you read that perhaps more carefully than you read the comic itself Because otherwise you'll miss a lot of the very deep and very well executed meaning and symbolism that is present.

546
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:22,800
Speaker 0: That you know, we talked about utenna before it.

547
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:39,159
Speaker 0: It was kind of the same thing shoujo kakumei utenna the anime where you have something that's so complex and well thought out that it's almost Cyclical and themes recur again and again and again and there are microcosms of the entire story taking place within Itself, it's like a recursion.

548
00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:56,020
Speaker 1: Yeah speaking of stories within the story the final structural thing about this comic that is very different from other comics is that there is a Kid there's an african-american kid who hangs out by the newsstand and the newsstand has a grumpy old You know a newsstand selling guy who always complains about the world and how it's all shitty.

549
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:06,720
Speaker 0: Those two are some of my favorite characters just for the scene the last scene with them near the end of the comic and This african-american kid sits there and he just he doesn't care about this old man yapping.

550
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:11,959
Speaker 1: He wants to read comic books and the pirate the comic he chooses to read is about pirates.

551
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:22,940
Speaker 0: now This is definitely a work of meta fiction because inside of the watchmen There is this pirate comic this pirate comic that could be a comic all in its own It is if you just pulled it apart in reddit.

552
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:30,654
Speaker 0: It is a straight-up comic that is in and of itself Independently very good very meaningful and very enjoyable.

553
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:36,052
Speaker 0: however do not Read it on its own without reading the watchmen.

554
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:36,834
Speaker 0: at the same time

555
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:40,585
Speaker 1: also if you're reading the watchmen Don't skip over the pirate comic

556
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:54,600
Speaker 0: because the without ruining much the pirate comic is very much a parallel for not just the overall theme of watchmen but for Multiple characters and multiple different things that are going on in the work.

557
00:40:55,221 --> 00:41:01,640
Speaker 0: And it's it acts as a foil a counterpoint it kind of and you may not realize exactly what it's saying.

558
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:09,443
Speaker 0: But there's a point at the end where the pirate comic ends simultaneously with something happening in the comic and That is the.

559
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:13,296
Speaker 0: that is the moment where I actually put the watchman down and said out loud.

560
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:16,592
Speaker 0: Wow Cuz I I knew it was coming.

561
00:41:16,632 --> 00:41:17,276
Speaker 0: It's like utenna.

562
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,370
Speaker 0: you see Everything was there.

563
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:29,240
Speaker 0: you could have put it all together And then finally you figure out what's happening at the moment it happens And it was too late for you to figure it out, and it's just it's beautiful.

564
00:41:29,675 --> 00:42:09,859
Speaker 1: Yeah the other thing about the pirate comic that I didn't catch until like the second or third reading is that the Pirate comic that it exists in the world of the watchmen as a physical object Actually has a place in the plot not the contents of the pirate comic But the physical pirate comic itself not the paper the kid is holding on to but the work of art that is the pirate comic has a place in the plot of the watchmen that you will not catch unless you pay close attention and Read the text at the end of the chapters and read the pirate comic and pay attention to all the words that are there And then at some point you will notice something happening in the plot of.

565
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:16,500
Speaker 1: That is related to the pirate comic in a direct way, and it's not easy to see.

566
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,854
Speaker 1: But when you finally realize it you go.

567
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:21,718
Speaker 1: oh That's ah fuck.

568
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:29,730
Speaker 0: Watchmen is one of those rare works And I say rare because I have very little free time.

569
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:45,530
Speaker 0: Scott has very little free time and yet despite the fact that I am Constantly deluge deluge with all sorts of media all of which I want to consume and interact with I will take the time to Reconsume certain media over and over again.

570
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:48,440
Speaker 0: I've watched cowboy bebop three or four times.

571
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:55,320
Speaker 0: I've read the watchmen twice straight through and I really want to read it all again right now.

572
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:57,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm already starting to read it right.

573
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,680
Speaker 1: Thank you take already read it like four times.

574
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,197
Speaker 0: I'm thinking of taking it on the train tomorrow if you don't.

575
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:03,542
Speaker 1: yeah I don't know.

576
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:04,825
Speaker 1: We'll see how much I can read tonight.

577
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:15,411
Speaker 1: I got other stuff to read tonight, but yeah, but if you really like watchmen There's a version of the what you can buy the normal trade paperback Which is what we have for 20 bucks, which is good enough.

578
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:20,153
Speaker 1: you can also buy absolute watchmen Which is a gigantic beautiful hardcover book.

579
00:43:20,193 --> 00:43:30,726
Speaker 1: it's like 50 bucks on Amazon And if you respect the watchmen because you're not an idiot It's actually kind of worth it to buy that giant thing Monstrosity if you will.

580
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,860
Speaker 0: now another interesting thing is a lot of comics particularly the kinds that I dislike.

581
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:38,340
Speaker 0: They'll always have like a character doing something in the close focus.

582
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:52,840
Speaker 0: you're like you're zoomed in on the superhero with his arm back and the motion lines like he's gonna punch someone and the yellow text at the top says You know Superman punch the dude and then it shows Superman saying I'm gonna punch you and then it shows them.

583
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:02,560
Speaker 0: Maybe if the comics from the 70s they stopped doing a lot of that stuff, but a lot of comics use thought bubbles Independent of all that showing characters thoughts showing what they're thinking.

584
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:04,987
Speaker 0: Watchmen never does that.

585
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,792
Speaker 0: it is entirely cinematic.

586
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:18,000
Speaker 0: you can guess at what characters motivations are from Monologues from their diaries that you'll read from their body language from the things they say But you never actually see into anyone's head.

587
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:24,625
Speaker 1: You know that the thought bubbles and superhero comics when I had a style years ago, right good Thought bubbles in a long time.

588
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:28,738
Speaker 0: good because then comedic come because I really really hate thought bubbles.

589
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:34,368
Speaker 0: in fact I often don't like it when I read a novel and I see inside someone's thoughts Yeah, what they do.

590
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:38,886
Speaker 1: sometimes though is they have that you know the narration boxes Which now Watchmen does have.

591
00:44:38,947 --> 00:44:42,740
Speaker 1: you know like it says from the something something narration in a square box?

592
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:46,513
Speaker 1: And then you know the comic gets going yeah, and they're definitely.

593
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:48,500
Speaker 0: the narration jumps around a lot.

594
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:52,020
Speaker 0: You know a lot more than the characters do at any given time.

595
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:57,426
Speaker 1: Well, I think you know, but rim does make a point in that this doesn't have thought bubbles But thought bubbles in comics.

596
00:44:57,687 --> 00:45:01,080
Speaker 1: superhero comics in America didn't go out of style until years later.

597
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:03,540
Speaker 1: Watchmen was way ahead of its time.

598
00:45:03,821 --> 00:45:12,076
Speaker 1: I mean if you took this and you gave it to someone you know especially the absolute edition with the superior printing so they couldn't Guess by the print quality you know.

599
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:13,524
Speaker 1: hey When was this written?

600
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:23,479
Speaker 1: and they read the whole thing and they say oh, I think this was written in year X. It's pretty hard for people to guess the late 80s, but that's when it was written, and that's when it was published.

601
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:30,139
Speaker 0: now Also, I mean I use the word cinematic and a part of that was because you know you don't hear characters thoughts like that's.

602
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:40,420
Speaker 0: the big Problem with in my mind when they made Death Note into an anime is that most of Death Note is thinking is a character thinking To himself and turning that into a monologue really isn't that great.

603
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,139
Speaker 0: But if it weren't for the fact that it would be hours and hours and hours long.

604
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:53,406
Speaker 0: Watchmen could probably be directly Word-for-word scene for scene turned into a movie And it would work perfectly.

605
00:45:53,747 --> 00:46:10,779
Speaker 1: the thing about Watchmen is one of those things where you know while you're reading it It's sort of like you're watching like one of the most amazing movies ever you know and After you're done reading it if you've ingested it fully and you know it then you can in your mind Play the movie Watchmen one of the greatest movies ever.

606
00:46:11,342 --> 00:46:18,248
Speaker 1: But you know that if someone actually tried to make this into a movie on film There is no way they could possibly capture.

607
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:20,154
Speaker 1: What is in this book on film.

608
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,940
Speaker 1: It's just it's unfeasible.

609
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:34,739
Speaker 0: I mean V for Vendetta did a pretty good job in terms of taking the spirit of that work and Translating it to the screen, and I think V for Vendetta was a thousand times easier to do than Watchmen.

610
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:36,187
Speaker 1: How about ten thousand times?

611
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:38,599
Speaker 0: I don't trust anyone to make a Watchmen movie.

612
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are trying.

613
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,940
Speaker 1: It's been like one of those rumors on the internet for a long time.

614
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:44,448
Speaker 0: I don't think it could be.

615
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:48,128
Speaker 0: it would have to at least be a series In one time.

616
00:46:48,289 --> 00:46:58,640
Speaker 1: it may come to pass that there will be a Watchmen movie But it will be so difficult for that movie to appease anyone who can appreciates the comic.

617
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:02,340
Speaker 0: I mean this would be about as difficult as when they made the Lord of the Rings movies.

618
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:07,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lord of the Rings like managed to pull it off by some miracle It would be.

619
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:10,280
Speaker 1: it would take a miracle ten times that power to do the Watchmen.

620
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,112
Speaker 0: Well at least of that power at least at least at bear.

621
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:19,469
Speaker 1: that to be a satisfactory job And you'd pretty much demand an awesome job.

622
00:47:19,689 --> 00:47:28,497
Speaker 1: so because you have reading this comic in your mind This image of everyone who reads this and understands it has in their mind the Watchmen movie.

623
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:29,300
Speaker 1: That is so amazing.

624
00:47:29,802 --> 00:47:38,167
Speaker 1: So if you actually tried to watch a real Watchmen movie if it didn't live up to the movie in your mind It would probably wouldn't sit well.

625
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:39,349
Speaker 1: I imagine with most people.

626
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,813
Speaker 0: so let's talk about the art.

627
00:47:41,214 --> 00:47:46,752
Speaker 0: the art is gritty dark and Incredibly thought-out planned in detail.

628
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:58,972
Speaker 1: well the thing about it's like the art Like the quality of the art the drawing and the coloring itself is actually it's slightly above average for a comic of the 80s But it's really not so amazing.

629
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:03,479
Speaker 1: It's not like an Alex Ross Painting of amazing detail or anything like that.

630
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,588
Speaker 1: What's more important about the art.

631
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:16,320
Speaker 1: you know to me is not how well it's drawn But what is drawn like if you look at any frame of Watchmen right like his two characters talking, right?

632
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,108
Speaker 1: But there's all this other stuff in the picture too.

633
00:48:19,148 --> 00:48:20,592
Speaker 1: There's stuff in the background.

634
00:48:20,653 --> 00:48:20,934
Speaker 1: There's.

635
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:22,900
Speaker 1: you know the characters are doing things.

636
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,092
Speaker 1: There's is all sorts of little details in every single frame.

637
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:36,018
Speaker 1: then unless you read it incredibly slowly and look At every single thing in every single frame you're missing out on more than half of the comic.

638
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:45,809
Speaker 0: also There are symbols that you probably won't even recognize on the first read-through, and then you'll read through again, and you'll see him Everywhere and you didn't even realize it.

639
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:51,840
Speaker 0: or one really interesting thing is pretty much any time There is a scene transition that is meaningful.

640
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:56,313
Speaker 0: Look at where one scene ends and where the next scene begins.

641
00:48:56,573 --> 00:49:00,897
Speaker 0: the transitions are laid out as though It were a film as opposed to a comic book.

642
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:03,174
Speaker 0: There's probably a word for that.

643
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:10,639
Speaker 0: in fact I think when Emily took me to a lecture with one of her professors way back in the city We watched bits from Citizen Kane where they did the same thing.

644
00:49:11,143 --> 00:49:13,279
Speaker 0: But I don't know what the word is and I feel kind of dumb here.

645
00:49:13,665 --> 00:49:14,418
Speaker 0: So I'll just leave it be.

646
00:49:14,901 --> 00:49:22,045
Speaker 0: But it's like that where like you focus on one thing and the scene changes around that thing and becomes the next scene and it's Just seamless and beautiful.

647
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:34,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think what really gets me Is that every time it's part of the reason why I can read it so many goddamn times Is that every time you read it like you'll notice in a particular like in a tiny panel a normal average panel?

648
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,068
Speaker 1: You know look here is a nine panel grid.

649
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,687
Speaker 1: on some page in each one of these panels there's something in the background.

650
00:49:41,707 --> 00:50:00,360
Speaker 1: there might be a billboard or a newspaper on the ground or a graffiti on the wall or Some stranger character, that's not actually a named character doing something with someone else or a Shadow of someone doing something and all of it is meaningful in a way.

651
00:50:00,441 --> 00:50:02,920
Speaker 1: That is obvious if you take the time to notice it.

652
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,970
Speaker 1: It's not like a tenor where it's some symbol.

653
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:11,020
Speaker 1: like you know some character keeps Hitting their stopwatch and random numbers are showing up, and you don't know what that means.

654
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:14,271
Speaker 1: Yes, it is if you see it, and you're not an idiot.

655
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:16,237
Speaker 1: It's obvious like oh my god.

656
00:50:16,278 --> 00:50:16,960
Speaker 1: Look at that there.

657
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:22,717
Speaker 0: Holy shit, I do keep comparing it to a tenor, but at the same time as much as I love utana.

658
00:50:22,777 --> 00:50:29,414
Speaker 0: I think watchmen is Deeper and especially the commentary that is in watchmen and the thick is it.

659
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:50,399
Speaker 0: you know anything can have a lot of well-executed Symbolism, but not only is the symbolism and the meaning beneath it relevant That's in watchmen, but it's relevant directly to the world we live in now And it touches on a lot of very uncomfortable issues and issues that I don't actually have a strong opinion on Because I'm about as conflicted as the characters in the story are.

660
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:59,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's that the issues that watchmen brings up are so powerful that I like I. it's weird usually when some other work of art brings up issues.

661
00:50:59,894 --> 00:51:01,500
Speaker 1: You know it's like I start to form an opinion.

662
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,405
Speaker 1: I see what opinion they have of it.

663
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:07,317
Speaker 1: I decide if I agree or disagree and watchmen that doesn't really happen.

664
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:10,320
Speaker 1: like I just kind of Go with it, and it's just waiting.

665
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:21,580
Speaker 1: It's like I'm waiting through this muck But the muck is rich with awesome art And I don't even bother trying to decide if I if I'm going that way or if I'm going the other way or what?

666
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:32,139
Speaker 1: I think I just take it in and let it go because there's really no other way And I just try to get as much of it as possible Because it's just so thick if I really wanted to get everything out of it.

667
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:40,400
Speaker 1: It's like if I read it so slowly that I poured over every single panel to get everything out of it Then it would take me so long.

668
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:45,111
Speaker 1: Then I forget like the two issues ago And I wouldn't get all of it into my brain.

669
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:48,708
Speaker 1: and if I read it too quickly I wouldn't see everything in every panel.

670
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:49,693
Speaker 1: It is oh God.

671
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:50,255
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

672
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:59,927
Speaker 0: And I think at that point without ruining anything because I don't even want to ruin Who all of the characters are.

673
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:04,100
Speaker 0: all I can really say is that you should read this work.

674
00:52:04,762 --> 00:52:15,659
Speaker 1: I don't recommend if you're listening to this show and anyone you know even like people who don't care about Talking your parents your children your brother Anyone who is age appropriate?

675
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:25,136
Speaker 1: I don't think little kids should probably read no no by anyone who's like high school or older and Who knows the English language or a language in which Watchmen is printed which I imagine is many.

676
00:52:25,557 --> 00:52:34,066
Speaker 1: if it's not many It's a crime should read the Watchmen no matter what it's like required reading for all human beings Even if you can't even afford the book.

677
00:52:34,106 --> 00:52:38,360
Speaker 1: if you cannot afford food, but you're going to live you should read the Watchmen.

678
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:43,975
Speaker 1: Let us close with a quote that it's from the Watchmen, but Watchmen takes it from elsewhere.

679
00:52:44,296 --> 00:52:45,800
Speaker 1: Yes our favorite quote ever.

680
00:52:46,742 --> 00:52:51,665
Speaker 0: I'm not going to read the entire poem even though it is also one of my favorite poems ever But it is in Watchmen.

681
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:58,631
Speaker 0: so you might hear me say and Scott say words from this often in fact Especially if you're playing with us in any sort of DS game.

682
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:00,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is one of our common phrases.

683
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,380
Speaker 1: You know I said there are quotes at the end of every issue.

684
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:11,709
Speaker 1: This is the quote that is at the end of chapter 11 the second to last chapter and on the pedestal these words appear My name is Ozzie mandy.

685
00:53:11,749 --> 00:53:15,806
Speaker 0: as king of kings look on my works Ye mighty and despair.

686
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:20,800
Speaker 1: look on my works ye mighty and despair despair.

687
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,638
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

688
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:32,844
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
