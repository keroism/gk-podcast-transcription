1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,189
Speaker 1: It's Monday, May 13th, 2019.

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,172
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:12,674
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,320
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,860
Speaker 1: We are talking about the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,038
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,500
Speaker 1: So, you know, when we start the show, we always like have a note about either biking, or we complain about the weather in some fashion.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,855
Speaker 0: But I don't want to complain about the weather.

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:29,240
Speaker 0: It's bad.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so normally, but I don't, I complain about the weather in a like, warm today, but I'm not actually that mad about the weather.

11
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,460
Speaker 1: And I also really don't like to have conversations.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,661
Speaker 0: I'm mad.

13
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:44,220
Speaker 0: It's the middle of May, and it's still like cold and wet, and it hasn't stopped being wet or cold.

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,254
Speaker 0: Where is the global warming that I've heard about?

15
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:48,300
Speaker 0: I'm not seeing it.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,428
Speaker 1: Because it's not global warming.

17
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:51,220
Speaker 1: It's destabilized climate.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,243
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

19
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:53,088
Speaker 0: I want the warming.

20
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:54,959
Speaker 0: Let's go back to what it used to be.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,020
Speaker 1: So on Saturday, I got up, and it was like the most perfect, beautiful day.

22
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, for one day.

23
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:03,156
Speaker 0: Actually, it was kind of cold, but otherwise good.

24
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,000
Speaker 0: I have way better than this.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,622
Speaker 1: Kind of cold.

26
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:05,689
Speaker 1: I went out in the afternoon.

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,736
Speaker 1: I ran shirtless.

28
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:07,260
Speaker 1: It was too hot.

29
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:07,919
Speaker 0: Still cold.

30
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:09,453
Speaker 1: I ran a half-marathon.

31
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:10,060
Speaker 1: It was a good time.

32
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,800
Speaker 1: Then I wake up Sunday, and it's cold, and it's just raining constantly, and I walked over to the climbing gym in the rain.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,730
Speaker 0: Which feels like a historic weather thing that was easier to use.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,275
Speaker 0: Like, what was the weather today, last week?

35
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,258
Speaker 1: Oh, meanwhile, Dazzle in the chat here is just like, "It's been excellent biking weather in

36
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:28,700
Speaker 1: London.".

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,222
Speaker 1: Like, really?

38
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:31,011
Speaker 1: London is the one place that isn't like this?

39
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,619
Speaker 1: I feel like this is London weather right here.

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,120
Speaker 0: Let's just get a big fan and blow our shit over there.

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,400
Speaker 1: Back over to London, where it belongs.

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,830
Speaker 1: Who's got our sun is the problem?

43
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,435
Speaker 1: I guess London?

44
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,100
Speaker 1: Maybe Seattle?

45
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,440
Speaker 1: But, uh, it is fucking miserable outside today.

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,160
Speaker 0: It's been miserable for all of April, and now half of May.

47
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:48,299
Speaker 1: Saturday was fine, though.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,560
Speaker 0: Why do I have to... Other years, I would start biking to work at, like, you know, early April, or even March.

49
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,480
Speaker 0: And meanwhile, this year, it's the middle of May, and I still can't bike to work.

50
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,059
Speaker 1: You know what they say, "April showers bring May showers, and it just keeps fucking raining forever, fuck

51
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:02,259
Speaker 1: you.".

52
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:03,200
Speaker 0: And then fucking June showers.

53
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:06,901
Speaker 1: Alright.

54
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:15,520
Speaker 1: So, there is actually a bunch of tech news, so I guess we'll get right into it before we talk about the WSL, which I've started to realize a lot of people do not know exists.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,128
Speaker 0: Really?

56
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:16,958
Speaker 0: Yeah.

57
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:17,603
Speaker 0: Okay.

58
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,556
Speaker 0: Seems like Microsoft's tooting the horn.

59
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,080
Speaker 0: I don't know.

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,180
Speaker 1: They are, but I feel like a lot... I've encountered people who are shocked that they can just SSH from Windows now.

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,720
Speaker 0: Well, that's different.

62
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:27,746
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

63
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,039
Speaker 1: Anyway, we'll get to that.

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,238
Speaker 0: So, you got any news?

65
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:30,921
Speaker 0: I do.

66
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:35,399
Speaker 0: So, today, le suprema corto of the United States...

67
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,200
Speaker 1: Which is already compromised with two corrupt justices.

68
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:40,740
Speaker 0: Uh, illegitimate.

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,457
Speaker 0: Illegitimate.

70
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,219
Speaker 0: Let's say that.

71
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,151
Speaker 1: Well, two of them are illegitimate.

72
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:45,440
Speaker 1: One of those two is corrupt.

73
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,370
Speaker 0: Anyway.

74
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:57,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, the most illegitimate and corrupt one decided to side with the good people, giving a 5-4 decision in favor of good, in my opinion.

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,120
Speaker 1: Kevin, who is probably a serial sexual abuser, allegedly.

76
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:11,120
Speaker 0: Anyway, way back, I think it was in 2011, someone decided to try a group of Apple phone users.

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,253
Speaker 0: What's their... Is it like Pepper?

78
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 0: I think it's called.

79
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,020
Speaker 1: It's Apple versus Pepper.

80
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,900
Speaker 0: Right, so whoever Pepper is, I don't fucking know, decided to sue Apple.

81
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,260
Speaker 0: And their argument... I'm not a lawyer, by the way.

82
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,079
Speaker 0: Their argument was like, was this.

83
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:32,180
Speaker 0: You got this app store, Apple, and nobody can sell apps to an iPhone user legally without going through your app store.

84
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,054
Speaker 0: You got a monopoly on iPhone apps, right?

85
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:36,160
Speaker 0: iOS apps.

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:46,492
Speaker 0: And you're charging developers a 30% fee, which means that the prices for users are inflated artificially because developers are passing that 30% fee onto the user.

87
00:03:48,641 --> 00:04:03,280
Speaker 0: And if there was competition, which there should be under antitrust law, then those prices of apps would be down and it would be better for users, so an Apple is the one who is causing this anti-competitive situation.

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,660
Speaker 0: Therefore, we're gonna sue Apple, and we want Apple to give all the users who bought apps their money back for those inflated prices.

89
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:18,360
Speaker 1: One could argue that Apple is not a monopoly except among people who choose to use Apple because there are way more Android phones than Apple phones.

90
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,100
Speaker 1: Android is a much bigger ecosystem.

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,860
Speaker 0: So they went to the Supreme Court not to decide if Apple is a monopoly or not.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,539
Speaker 0: That decision is a long ways off.

93
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:34,900
Speaker 0: They went to Apple today to decide, are you even allowed to sue Apple, you users?

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,060
Speaker 0: Because Apple's argument was like, look, you're users.

95
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,746
Speaker 0: You can't sue us for this.

96
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:43,519
Speaker 0: Only developers could sue us for this, and they're not doing so right now.

97
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:46,752
Speaker 0: The developers are the ones who are getting charged a 30% fee, not the users.

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,140
Speaker 0: Therefore, if we have some sort of antitrust going on, they weren't even arguing that they weren't antitrust, at least not yet.

99
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:00,699
Speaker 0: They're arguing that only developers would have, I guess, legal standing to sue for this.

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,119
Speaker 0: And the Supreme Court said, nah, users can sue.

101
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:27,240
Speaker 0: Based on the two or three articles I read, the reference was back in the day to this case about bricks and some state was suing the brick maker for high prices and anti-competition, but there was some issue where the bricks were being sold through a bunch of contractors and then to the state, and the state is effectively the user in this case.

102
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,032
Speaker 0: In that case, the ruling was, no, the contractors can sue.

103
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,758
Speaker 0: You're buying, not the state.

104
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:48,580
Speaker 0: But here, the argument, at least in the side of the users that Shitty Justice wrote, was no one is arguing that the apps are being sold by Apple.

105
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:53,400
Speaker 0: It's not like the developer selling the app through Apple.

106
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,880
Speaker 0: The transaction is between Apple and the user directly.

107
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:58,304
Speaker 0: Right?

108
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,180
Speaker 0: You're buying the app from the Apple store.

109
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,000
Speaker 0: Apple servers, you're buying it from Apple.

110
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:11,680
Speaker 0: Developers are just making products that then Apple then sells and just gives like a commission to the developer.

111
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:23,220
Speaker 0: So anyway, so now they, Pepper, whoever Pepper is, whatever, I don't know, go Pepper go, is going to go and now try to finish suing Apple back in some other court somewhere.

112
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:30,119
Speaker 1: So it'll be interesting how this plays out because on one hand, I think, Apple face a lot of these large tech companies probably should be broken up.

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:40,100
Speaker 0: That's a much bigger issue than this even smaller aspect of the breaking up of holding Monopoly on your closed walled garden platform.

114
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,219
Speaker 1: Yep, because it's hard to say at what point a walled garden becomes a Monopoly when there are other walled gardens.

115
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,580
Speaker 1: Apple does not have Monopoly on phone apps.

116
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:54,320
Speaker 1: They have a Monopoly on their own private platform of phones.

117
00:06:56,503 --> 00:07:01,240
Speaker 0: Just like in the Windows case, it was like, yeah, they didn't have Monopoly on operating systems.

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Speaker 0: They got in trouble because they were using their Monopoly and operating systems to then push IE over the other browsers by including it with the operating systems.

119
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,059
Speaker 1: Of course, those lawsuits were all ridiculous because in the end they got to the point where Well, that was the Justice Department suing Microsoft.

120
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:25,739
Speaker 1: But they got ridiculous because the argument basically was computers shouldn't come with any way to download things by default.

121
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,960
Speaker 1: If it doesn't come with a web browser, how do you go download a web browser?

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,980
Speaker 1: The fundamental problem.

123
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:43,260
Speaker 1: But the fact that Kavanaugh was the one with the majority opinion is interesting because the other illegitimate justice is on the dissenting opinion.

124
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the other evil justices were saying that, no, you can't sue Apple.

125
00:07:48,460 --> 00:08:02,480
Speaker 1: Now, what makes that extra interesting is that on one hand, Kavanaugh is the one with the most tenuous grasp on continuing to be a Supreme Court justice because it's not out of the realm that he could be impeached for the stuff that was discussed previously if we got our act together.

126
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:17,860
Speaker 0: If I could bring cases to the Supreme Court, my argument would be the president was elected illegitimately, therefore everything he did is illegitimate and every law and appointee and everything should just be undone.

127
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:18,715
Speaker 0: Undo.

128
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,868
Speaker 0: The problem is illegitimate.

129
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:29,739
Speaker 0: Supreme Court justices would have two of them who are themselves illegitimate would have the power to decide that, no, actually we aren't illegitimate.

130
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,979
Speaker 1: Well, no, because Congress can just remove them.

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,120
Speaker 0: Yes, but I'm saying I would have to argue to them that they are legitimate and they would have to say yes, we're illegitimate.

132
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:49,417
Speaker 1: Or, or, or we just add two more justices, which we don't need their consent to do, and then bring the case to them.

133
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,170
Speaker 0: Hello, new legitimate justices.

134
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,760
Speaker 0: Are your two friends there illegitimate?

135
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,862
Speaker 0: Why, yes,

136
00:08:55,425 --> 00:09:15,898
Speaker 1: but while Gorsuch is probably just illegitimate, Kavanaugh is way, there's a lot of more, a lot more issues with him anyway, but the reason I bring that up is that the fact that he sided with the liberal part of the court, on this issue is not necessarily a good sign because generally conservatives

137
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,540
Speaker 0: are also.

138
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,231
Speaker 0: It's not a good sign about anything in the future.

139
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:19,520
Speaker 0: It's just good in this one case.

140
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,345
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh, we got one.

141
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:20,809
Speaker 1: Yep.

142
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,300
Speaker 0: But something went in our favor.

143
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:32,199
Speaker 1: Conservative politicians in the US actually kind of want these large tech companies to be broken up because the tech companies hold a lot of power over them if they choose to wield it.

144
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,867
Speaker 0: So do people on the far left.

145
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,339
Speaker 0: We all want the big tech companies to be broken up.

146
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,306
Speaker 0: Everyone's anti-corporate, which is why someone with an anti-corporate platform should run for office.

147
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:51,291
Speaker 1: Hence, remember, Geek Nights, we have formally announced we support Elizabeth Warren because she's the first person who said she would break up big tech companies and had a specific plan.

148
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,859
Speaker 0: I will break them up like this.

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:53,821
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

150
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:54,304
Speaker 1: Let's go.

151
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:59,290
Speaker 1: So in some other news, this is pretty new.

152
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:01,180
Speaker 1: Like this news was today.

153
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,699
Speaker 0: Amazon is trying a big tech company that should be broken up.

154
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:06,365
Speaker 1: So get this.

155
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:07,431
Speaker 1: Here's what Amazon is doing.

156
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,140
Speaker 1: I'm going to summarize this because it's kind of new.

157
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:12,960
Speaker 0: I saw the headline only because I was reading three Supreme Court articles.

158
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,700
Speaker 1: So basically, if you work for Amazon today.

159
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:18,265
Speaker 0: Which job?

160
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:19,250
Speaker 1: Any job.

161
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:19,954
Speaker 1: Really?

162
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,100
Speaker 0: Even if I'm like a developer there?

163
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,268
Speaker 1: Developer, warehouse worker, whatever.

164
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,800
Speaker 1: I don't think any developer is going to do this.

165
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,326
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

166
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,177
Speaker 1: It depends on the details because...

167
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,949
Speaker 0: Vice president of something, something?

168
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:32,460
Speaker 0: Jane Janitor?

169
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:46,889
Speaker 1: Then if you quit your job, Amazon will give you money to start a delivery company and will continue to pay your salary for some amount of time while you start this new company.

170
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:51,433
Speaker 1: But then your company has to deliver packages for Amazon.

171
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,420
Speaker 0: Alright, how many?

172
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:53,524
Speaker 1: I don't know.

173
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:54,289
Speaker 1: The details are vague.

174
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,040
Speaker 1: You just got to make a company and make it profitable.

175
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,903
Speaker 1: Like basically turn yourself into an independent contractor so Amazon doesn't have to pay you any benefits of any kind.

176
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:02,928
Speaker 1: Alright.

177
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:10,745
Speaker 1: What's really funny about this is Amazon will cover ten thousand dollars in startup costs.

178
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:14,463
Speaker 0: That is not enough to even buy a single delivery vehicle.

179
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,000
Speaker 1: That is zero dollars in the real world.

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,865
Speaker 0: To start a delivery company, even if I was going to do it using like bicycles right?

181
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:26,484
Speaker 0: I would need to hire someone to ride the bicycles.

182
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,071
Speaker 1: To start a tiny game company.

183
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:33,093
Speaker 0: I would need like... To hire someone to ride a bicycle for a year is going to cost me more.

184
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,665
Speaker 0: Just their health care will cost me ten thousand dollars.

185
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:44,329
Speaker 1: To start a tiny game company that was going to make one game, like one real game before we burnt out our investment, I'd need like four hundred grand minimum.

186
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:44,872
Speaker 1: Yeah.

187
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,380
Speaker 1: And I'm talking like tiny, tiny game.

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,071
Speaker 0: If the number was bigger this would be fine.

189
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:49,654
Speaker 1: Yep.

190
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:57,574
Speaker 1: Oh, but those who participate will be allowed to lease blue vans with the Amazon smile logo, I assume from Amazon.

191
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:58,780
Speaker 0: For how much?

192
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:00,344
Speaker 1: Doesn't say.

193
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,154
Speaker 0: So you're going to give me ten thousand dollars.

194
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:02,998
Speaker 1: And you're going to pay my...

195
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,210
Speaker 0: Then I just give it right back to you to lease a van.

196
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:10,077
Speaker 1: And you're going to get paid your salary for three more months, but I assume you're not getting benefits anymore.

197
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:15,620
Speaker 0: This is just an evil financial mechanism to avoid simply hiring employees to ride the van.

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,161
Speaker 0: Yep.

199
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:16,885
Speaker 1: There.

200
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,137
Speaker 1: This is, as far as I can tell, this is nothing.

201
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:28,988
Speaker 0: We don't want to hire an employee to ride the van, so we will try to convince somebody else to start a company whereby which they will have the employee and then we don't have to pay all these taxes and shit.

202
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,727
Speaker 0: And then they are the employers, they pay all the taxes and all these other bullshit.

203
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:33,632
Speaker 0: Right.

204
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:34,235
Speaker 1: Yep.

205
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:35,703
Speaker 1: This is an interesting note here.

206
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:43,460
Speaker 1: The expansion is part of the company, I'm quoting the article, plan to gain more control over its deliveries rather than rely on UPS and the post office.

207
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:43,982
Speaker 0: Right.

208
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:50,155
Speaker 0: So they're setting up scam shell companies, but instead of just setting them up yourself, get your employees to do it.

209
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:50,758
Speaker 1: Yep.

210
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:51,260
Speaker 1: Here's the line.

211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,492
Speaker 1: It also gives Amazon a way to grow its delivery network without spending the money needed to buy vehicles or hire workers.

212
00:12:57,673 --> 00:12:58,939
Speaker 0: Yes, that's the thing.

213
00:12:59,580 --> 00:12:59,822
Speaker 1: Yep.

214
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,297
Speaker 1: The wage problem won't be Amazon's problem.

215
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:02,760
Speaker 0: Right.

216
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:13,832
Speaker 1: This is just bad news, and the crazy thing about it is there's this fundamental reason why I want to break up the big tech companies, and it's not just because they're so big and so powerful.

217
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:18,514
Speaker 1: That's just one, like, relatively adjacent aspect to the thing I'm actually mad about.

218
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:22,708
Speaker 1: These tech companies have more money than you can imagine just sitting in cash.

219
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,737
Speaker 1: They don't know what to do with this money.

220
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,525
Speaker 0: I know exactly what to do with that money.

221
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,973
Speaker 1: I mean, I know what I would do with this money.

222
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:44,575
Speaker 0: I think part of the problem is, A, they don't do the money, but B, because of lack of creativity, right, and B, they are with, like, they're all public companies, so they can't do anything with the money that would upset the shareholders of the board.

223
00:13:44,676 --> 00:13:47,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they're actually holding to the shareholders.

224
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:53,740
Speaker 1: They can be sued by their own shareholders if they don't maximize the shareholders value over all other things.

225
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,963
Speaker 0: Right, so I'm sure, like, you know, if I was the CEO of, you know, if they kicked out Tim Cook and I was the CEO of Apple, I would have lots of things to do with that money, and as soon as I did one of those things...

226
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:03,089
Speaker 1: The board would be like, "You're fucking

227
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,190
Speaker 1: gone.".

228
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,375
Speaker 0: The board would just be like, "You're out.

229
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:05,118
Speaker 0: See

230
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:05,460
Speaker 0: ya.".

231
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:06,082
Speaker 0: Yep.

232
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,769
Speaker 0: And then someone else would do it, right?

233
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,530
Speaker 0: Because they vote based on just making shares worth more.

234
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:21,561
Speaker 1: But it shows that if you, like, a lot of tech companies like Uber will invest in technology that will then later let them get rid of these pesky workers.

235
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:29,619
Speaker 0: And this is why the first thing you must do with the money, even though it is not the creative thing that you wanted to do with the money, is buy back all the stock.

236
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:29,941
Speaker 1: Yep.

237
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:32,174
Speaker 0: They love the stock buyback.

238
00:14:32,194 --> 00:14:33,279
Speaker 0: They're like, "Hey guys, we're gonna do stock

239
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:33,681
Speaker 0: buybacks.".

240
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,249
Speaker 0: Like, "Ooh, I share the worth so

241
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,409
Speaker 0: much.".

242
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,897
Speaker 0: "Yes, please do that.

243
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,288
Speaker 0: Now I have 51% and I don't listen to you

244
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:39,610
Speaker 0: anymore.".

245
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,775
Speaker 0: But look at this!

246
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:53,559
Speaker 1: You got a company like Uber that is trying to invest his money in self-driving cars while simultaneously having these not-employee employees driving the cars for them subsidized, and eventually they just won't need those employees anymore and they have a monopoly.

247
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,981
Speaker 1: Amazon's trying to even skip that step and not even pretend this is about technology.

248
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:03,649
Speaker 1: They're literally just, "Hey, we'll give you a pittance if you're willing to take all the risk of being a delivery company for

249
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:03,810
Speaker 1: us.".

250
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,774
Speaker 1: It's odd.

251
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:09,499
Speaker 1: If I were you, I would not jump on this.

252
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:19,649
Speaker 1: Unless you are planning to quit Amazon anyway, then I guess start a company, fail, and get paid for three months while you're also looking for another job.

253
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,039
Speaker 0: I wonder if you can get away with that.

254
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:22,743
Speaker 1: I don't know.

255
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,881
Speaker 0: Get an accountant to see if there's some way to get the 10,000.

256
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,590
Speaker 0: You gotta read the contract.

257
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,598
Speaker 1: The 10,000 is not the thing you care about.

258
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,955
Speaker 0: No, but you have to see the contract with Amazon to see if you can get away with it.

259
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:38,825
Speaker 1: This is just, it's really bad, and again, this is why we want to break up these tech companies.

260
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:50,100
Speaker 1: In another minor news before we get into the main bit, you may remember there's crazy people who try to live on those offshore platforms off the coast of the UK from World War II.

261
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:51,990
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, Sealand died a long time ago.

262
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,094
Speaker 0: Sealand is over.

263
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:54,661
Speaker 0: Sealand was a big deal when we were in college.

264
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,566
Speaker 0: We were like, "Ooh,

265
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:56,269
Speaker 0: Sealand!".

266
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,262
Speaker 1: That's where we can dock the barge!

267
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:03,127
Speaker 0: Well, that's where we can put the heads, like, server computer hosting there, and it's like, "Aha!

268
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:08,553
Speaker 0: We can host our sites on Sealand and host all our illegal pirated stuff, and they can't block

269
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:08,653
Speaker 0: us.".

270
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,169
Speaker 1: So, obviously, that was all dumb for a lot of reasons.

271
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,263
Speaker 0: Wasn't dumb for college kids.

272
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:15,746
Speaker 1: Yup.

273
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,517
Speaker 1: Well, because we didn't care that much.

274
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,609
Speaker 1: We just needed a place to park that barge.

275
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:21,697
Speaker 1: Anyway.

276
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:23,104
Speaker 1: I should link to that episode.

277
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,455
Speaker 1: That's from like 2005.

278
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:36,891
Speaker 1: So, this has apparently still been going on, but the Venn diagram between people who want to live on, like, 20 meter wide octagons in international waters.

279
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,716
Speaker 0: Where do they get food from?

280
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,225
Speaker 1: And people who really care about fake cryptocurrencies?

281
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:44,370
Speaker 0: Oh, that's like the same person.

282
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,214
Speaker 0: It's just a circle.

283
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,421
Speaker 0: There's a 100% overlap.

284
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:47,930
Speaker 1: That diagram is a circle.

285
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,873
Speaker 0: It's the same people.

286
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:49,476
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:52,793
Speaker 1: So, there was apparently a company and a bunch of rich people.

288
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,756
Speaker 1: Peter Thiel, I guess, even like donated money to this thing.

289
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,667
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the middle of the circle.

290
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:00,130
Speaker 0: is that guy.

291
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:00,471
Speaker 0: Yup.

292
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:05,497
Speaker 1: So, he gave a million dollars to the Seasteading Institute, and they were trying to make it a thing.

293
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,950
Speaker 0: With a million dollars, he could open up an Amazon delivery company.

294
00:17:08,131 --> 00:17:17,578
Speaker 1: So, basically, their idea was the same thing, but they wanted to use these octagon things floating 12 miles outside of Thailand.

295
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:18,623
Speaker 0: Okay.

296
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:23,327
Speaker 1: And they claim, yes, it is 12 nautical miles away from Thailand.

297
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,935
Speaker 1: It is technically international waters.

298
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,522
Speaker 1: We are a sovereign nation.

299
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:31,029
Speaker 1: Thailand said, and some rich people did this, and we're living on this thing.

300
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:38,989
Speaker 1: Thailand said, yeah, we have exclusive economic rights to a 200 mile radius, and we'll fucking kill you.

301
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:49,139
Speaker 1: Because they have threatened Thailand's national sovereignty by declaring their own sovereignty, and that is a crime punishable in Thailand by death.

302
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:55,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Thailand has, Thailand has, you know, it's not the US Navy, but it's a boat with big guns on it.

303
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,910
Speaker 0: I wouldn't fuck with them unless you're the US Navy.

304
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,957
Speaker 0: Or the Chinese Navy or something.

305
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:10,462
Speaker 1: It's a lot like how crazy don't-tread-on-me malicious shitheads in the US will have, like, their stock of AR-15s and they'll be like, "Gumman's coming after me.

306
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:11,668
Speaker 1: I'll be able to stand my

307
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:11,889
Speaker 1: ground.".

308
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,639
Speaker 0: And then the FBI comes.

309
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, two Marines show up and you're done.

310
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,230
Speaker 1: One helicopter.

311
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,721
Speaker 0: So the Thai Navy, what, sent like a destroyer and shot them?

312
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:26,506
Speaker 1: So the Thai Navy went to arrest this couple, and they were- Well, they actually tried to arrest them.

313
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:26,948
Speaker 0: How nice.

314
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:29,179
Speaker 1: Well, we assume they were going to detain them.

315
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,003
Speaker 1: Maybe they were just going to blow it up.

316
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 0: I thought they were just going to shoot the guns at the thing as a warning shot.

317
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:43,791
Speaker 1: I imagine the Navy was going to detain them, take all their stuff, and then either execute them per their own laws or scare them enough and then make them leave.

318
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:44,515
Speaker 1: Like, something like that.

319
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:44,937
Speaker 1: We don't know.

320
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:47,430
Speaker 0: Why don't they just go 200 miles away where it's not a problem?

321
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,245
Speaker 1: Because there aren't just octagons floating 200 miles away.

322
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,058
Speaker 0: Didn't they make this octagon?

323
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,364
Speaker 1: I think they were already there.

324
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:55,510
Speaker 1: Like, I don't know the full story.

325
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,755
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

326
00:18:56,776 --> 00:19:01,459
Speaker 1: Because it only made the news after the Thai government came in and said, "Yeah, that's not going to

327
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,103
Speaker 1: fly.".

328
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:07,067
Speaker 1: So the people who were living on it have fled and are hiding somewhere in Thailand.

329
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,299
Speaker 0: Oh, they fled the octagon and went to Thailand?

330
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,203
Speaker 1: Where else are they going to go?

331
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:12,914
Speaker 0: Wouldn't you just go to, like, somewhere else?

332
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,725
Speaker 0: Like, Cambodia's not far.

333
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:17,278
Speaker 1: So it's not clear where they are right now.

334
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,956
Speaker 0: I would go to non-Thai- If Thailand is out to kill you, go to non-Thailand.

335
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think they had a boat they could get them anywhere else.

336
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,234
Speaker 0: At least another country at minimum would have to extradite you, and it would be a slight impediment.

337
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:29,581
Speaker 0: you would live slightly longer.

338
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:35,409
Speaker 1: So best I can tell, they're on the run, and- Just get in a boat and go somewhere else.

339
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,614
Speaker 1: Find a hexagon somewhere.

340
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:41,401
Speaker 1: The moral of the story is that people with too much- Go to a Malaysian hexagon.

341
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:46,750
Speaker 1: People with too much tech money should not have any amount of power over other people.

342
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:50,846
Speaker 1: That is the moral of the beginning of Geek Nights, and now it's time for-.

343
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:53,445
Speaker 0: Also, don't declare yourself sovereign without a military.

344
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:53,768
Speaker 0: Yeah.

345
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,062
Speaker 1: That's Pitoria.

346
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:57,890
Speaker 0: To back it up.

347
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,195
Speaker 1: That's season one family guy Pitoria.

348
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:08,696
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

349
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:15,689
Speaker 1: So, anyone who claims that they understand the broad strokes of how quantum mechanics works is fucking lying to you.

350
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,233
Speaker 0: Quantum mechanics is way more- I know, like, these general concepts, and I barely know them.

351
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,304
Speaker 1: Alright, Scott, what is a quark?

352
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,103
Speaker 0: It's a particle that's smaller than a proton or a neutron.

353
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:28,655
Speaker 0: You need, like, a whole bunch of them to make a proton or a neutron or whatever.

354
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:29,439
Speaker 1: How many do you need?

355
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,223
Speaker 1: Like, what's in them, though?

356
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:31,810
Speaker 0: They've got, like, different spins and shit.

357
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,258
Speaker 0: I don't fucking know how many you need.

358
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:33,620
Speaker 0: Alright.

359
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:34,867
Speaker 0: What's the- They matter, though.

360
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:35,490
Speaker 0: They're not in energy.

361
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,536
Speaker 0: I know that much.

362
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:39,070
Speaker 1: What is an electron?

363
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,952
Speaker 0: It's a different particle.

364
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:46,747
Speaker 0: It's not a quark, but it's not proton or neutron level.

365
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,635
Speaker 0: It's, you know, it's pretty fundamental.

366
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,585
Speaker 0: It's on, like, the quark level.

367
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:52,254
Speaker 1: Well, it's made of quarks.

368
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,570
Speaker 0: I thought electron was as small as electron goes.

369
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:56,796
Speaker 0: See?

370
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:57,480
Speaker 0: It shows what I know.

371
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:06,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I, when I was in high school, we actually had to take classes on quantum mechanics, so I have, like, an advanced high school knowledge, which means I don't fucking know anything.

372
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:12,132
Speaker 1: I also read hyperspace, so I felt like I knew something for a year, then I realized I didn't know anything.

373
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:22,304
Speaker 1: But what I remember from high school, and now there's a video that goes into a lot more detail about this, if you put- Basically, there's this idea called pilot wave theory.

374
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,450
Speaker 1: It's an old, old theory.

375
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:24,476
Speaker 0: The two slit thing?

376
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:34,425
Speaker 1: No, pilot wave theory is a way in quantum mechanics to explain the results of the slit, the two slit experiment.

377
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:35,972
Speaker 0: So I said the two slit thing.

378
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:37,540
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but it's not just that.

379
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,294
Speaker 1: It also explains quantum tunneling and all sorts of nonsense.

380
00:21:40,314 --> 00:21:41,037
Speaker 0: That's a word I know.

381
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:51,993
Speaker 1: The rough idea, I'm probably gonna get it pretty wrong, because this is my high school memory, is that the things we observe, like protons, electrons, like the particles, even photons like light.

382
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,264
Speaker 1: You know how light is both a wave and a particle?

383
00:21:54,806 --> 00:22:09,822
Speaker 1: Well, this theory basically says that the photon itself is a particle, and there's a lot of particles that do things, and the particles travel on their own, and they follow these rules, but they travel via waves that precede them through spacetime.

384
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:18,385
Speaker 1: They're piloted by these waves that we can't detect, and if you can model the waves, then you can understand the fucked up behavior of the particles.

385
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:34,370
Speaker 1: This is why the individual photons interfere with each other, even though you literally shoot them one at a time, and at no point could they have interacted with each other, because they're basically following the same pilot wave, and the pilot wave interfered with itself.

386
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:43,070
Speaker 1: That is the best way I can explain that, and I'm sure anyone who knows more about quantum mechanics is already facepalming, but you can model this.

387
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,355
Speaker 0: So why is this thing of day?

388
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:58,609
Speaker 1: You can model that behavior and that fundamental theory about how quantum mechanics works very easily and with a shocking degree of accuracy by just putting some drops of oil on some water and vibrating that water.

389
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:18,529
Speaker 1: Like, the mechanics are pretty much the same, the experimental results are pretty much the same, like, this is one of the most elegant analogies for quantum mechanics and why electrons behave the way they do, and why photons behave the way they do, that you'll ever encounter, and I just found a YouTube video that explains it really well.

390
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,254
Speaker 1: It's really cool.

391
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,440
Speaker 1: Alright,

392
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:37,761
Speaker 0: anyway, so, in a lot of touristy places on Earth, I'm not sure which touristy place this started in, but I've seen it happen on bridges, especially, I've seen it happen at, like, the tops of mountains, where, like, you go hiking and there's like a fence around the observation deck, right?

393
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:42,204
Speaker 0: Pretty much anywhere, there's like a fence with, like, rungs or bars on it.

394
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:43,370
Speaker 0: Especially bridges.

395
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:44,355
Speaker 0: I said bridges already.

396
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,972
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, like, the middle of a bridge is, like, where people do this.

397
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,802
Speaker 0: It's things that you can fall off of, right?

398
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:53,359
Speaker 0: Bridges, observation decks, towers, things like that.

399
00:23:53,741 --> 00:24:12,151
Speaker 0: Tourists, for some reason, I don't know where it started, have decided to get locks, like, cheap key locks or combination locks, inscribe something on the lock, like, you know, I heart you, or us forever, and then put that lock onto the fence or, you know, touristy place.

400
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:23,227
Speaker 1: The history of Love Padlocks dates back to at least 100 years to a melancholic Serbian tale of World War I, with an attribution to a particular bridge in the spy town of, I'm not going to try to pronounce that.

401
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:24,392
Speaker 0: Okay, that's good to know.

402
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:35,610
Speaker 0: Anyway, and people put these locks on the fences or bridges or whatever, and it's sort of like, you know, sort of like scratching your "I heart you" in the tree, where it's, like, a permanent thing.

403
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:37,478
Speaker 0: You think of it as a permanent thing, right?

404
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:42,483
Speaker 0: It's like, we will leave this permanent thing here as, like, a landmark to our... Like, you go back home.

405
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,046
Speaker 0: You know, to us.

406
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:47,928
Speaker 1: And you think, like, you look at the key, and you're like, "Yeah, that lock is still on that bridge in

407
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:48,350
Speaker 1: Paris.".

408
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:54,866
Speaker 0: It's there forever, you know, it's like a, you know, a token of our whatever, memory, you know, love, whatever.

409
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:58,683
Speaker 1: So, apparently, they were not common until the early 2000s, like...

410
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:02,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, because cheap locks were not available until then.

411
00:25:03,005 --> 00:25:03,728
Speaker 1: Yes, they were.

412
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:12,491
Speaker 1: I would argue that they became popular starting in the early 2000s, because the internet made it, like, the idea spread very far and very fast somewhat.

413
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:16,612
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, these things are a plague, right?

414
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:17,436
Speaker 0: They ruin...

415
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:23,407
Speaker 1: Oh, someone wrote a book about it in 2006, and then a movie was made in 2007, then it really kicked off.

416
00:25:23,568 --> 00:25:27,227
Speaker 0: Anyway, first of all, they cause lots of damage to the fences.

417
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:35,289
Speaker 0: They weigh so fucking much that there have actually been places where, like, the fences have, like, been damaged and fallen over, because the weight is too much.

418
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:40,535
Speaker 1: It got so bad in Algiers that the imam there, like, literally banned them.

419
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:41,842
Speaker 0: Yep, good move.

420
00:25:41,862 --> 00:25:51,690
Speaker 0: Two, they damage, like, landmark, like, some of these bridges are like old, fancy historical bridges, not like, you know, boring-ass Queensborough Bridge like we have.

421
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:53,919
Speaker 1: I see locks on the Queensborough Bridge.

422
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,146
Speaker 0: They cut them off pretty quickly.

423
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:55,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're there.

424
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,463
Speaker 0: I've seen, like, one or two, and then it's like,

425
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:58,704
Speaker 0: "Nope."

426
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:01,177
Speaker 0: Someone's job is to cut those off of our bridges.

427
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:02,101
Speaker 0: They are ahead of that.

428
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:05,356
Speaker 0: They don't let them pile up more than, like, a handful, right, and they're pretty rare.

429
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:05,919
Speaker 0: Anyway.

430
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,422
Speaker 0: For now.

431
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,009
Speaker 1: It seems like it's mostly a thing in Europe.

432
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:22,701
Speaker 0: Well, it's a thing where it's like when you see one, then other people get the idea to add more, but the thing is, even if you get that idea, there aren't locks for sale near the bridge, and apparently in a lot of touristy places, there are scammy people selling

433
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:23,285
Speaker 1: locks.

434
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:24,270
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

435
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,495
Speaker 0: And they sell the locks.

436
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:28,390
Speaker 1: Here's a love lock for the Brooklyn Bridge, and while you're at it, here's a pass.

437
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:31,587
Speaker 1: I will sell you at a discount for the Staten Island Ferry.

438
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:32,010
Speaker 0: Right.

439
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:34,359
Speaker 0: Staten Island Ferry is free, not New York people.

440
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:35,646
Speaker 0: Anybody.

441
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:36,410
Speaker 0: Just get on to it.

442
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:43,246
Speaker 1: If you bought a ticket to the Staten Island Ferry to the Statue of Liberty, there are, like, cops that have to keep going around arresting people for selling tickets to the ferry.

443
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,609
Speaker 1: You bought a piece of paper that means nothing from a hobo.

444
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:56,574
Speaker 0: Right, but anyway, people are going around near landmarks selling locks to tourists for, like, $20 or 20 euros.

445
00:26:56,956 --> 00:27:00,613
Speaker 0: Those locks, like, 50-cent locks you could just buy in, like, a bundle, right?

446
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:00,955
Speaker 1: Yep.

447
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:07,227
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, in my thing of the day, this dude goes to Prague.

448
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:07,810
Speaker 0: He's in Prague.

449
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,674
Speaker 0: I guess he lives there.

450
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:09,136
Speaker 0: I don't know.

451
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:13,196
Speaker 0: And he goes to this area near a bridge with his tons of locks.

452
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:16,070
Speaker 0: Not as many as I've seen in other places, but still too many.

453
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:17,898
Speaker 0: And he starts cutting them off.

454
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:21,921
Speaker 0: And he rants about them, and he cuts them off, and, man, they get a haul.

455
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:23,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, this feels good.

456
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,921
Speaker 1: This is very satisfying to watch, because I hate those stupid locks.

457
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:28,432
Speaker 0: It's definitely one of those satisfying videos, like, ah, the fence is clean.

458
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:32,190
Speaker 0: now in the small portion they were able to clean because there's too many fucking locks.

459
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,838
Speaker 1: Oh, his YouTube comment is great, too, on the video.

460
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,285
Speaker 1: "Please don't take it the wrong way.

461
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:40,693
Speaker 1: We want you to come to Prague and have a nice time here, but please don't destroy our heritage sites by putting up some stupid

462
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:41,055
Speaker 1: locks.".

463
00:27:41,336 --> 00:27:41,758
Speaker 0: That's right.

464
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,723
Speaker 1: Yeah.

465
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:43,386
Speaker 1: Fuck that.

466
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:49,053
Speaker 0: I like how no police in Prague, like, stopped the guy who was just there with angle grinders and...

467
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:51,306
Speaker 1: Dude, the cops are probably like, "Thank you,

468
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:51,669
Speaker 1: sir.".

469
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,412
Speaker 0: Right.

470
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:57,737
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, we have two of our recent panels just on YouTube.

471
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:04,310
Speaker 1: If you want to feel sad, the real harm of games, and if you want to feel glad, uh, what was the other one we put up?

472
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,079
Speaker 1: The 40 games you must... Rare game mechanics.

473
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,994
Speaker 1: And the 40 games you must play, and the 40 tabletop games.

474
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:11,044
Speaker 1: The moral is, go to our YouTube channel.

475
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:11,748
Speaker 1: There are a ton.

476
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:12,854
Speaker 0: There's a case of 40s.

477
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:14,783
Speaker 0: Yes, 40.

478
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:18,801
Speaker 1: I feel like I want to do 40 more games you should play.

479
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:21,014
Speaker 0: Don't ask where the case of 40s joke came from.

480
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:23,550
Speaker 1: That is best not remembered.

481
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,112
Speaker 1: I remember the whole fucking thing.

482
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:35,046
Speaker 1: Anyway, the Geek Nights Book Club book, if you did not notice, is the painfully written pages of pain.

483
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:37,938
Speaker 0: I am exactly 64% done with the pages of pain.

484
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,562
Speaker 1: I am.

485
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:41,237
Speaker 1: 58% done.

486
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:41,558
Speaker 1: Whoa.

487
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:44,010
Speaker 1: Because the weather is shitty, so I'm reading it on the subway.

488
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,995
Speaker 0: That's right.

489
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,383
Speaker 0: I just read a chapter on the way here.

490
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:57,862
Speaker 1: So, all I want to say, having gotten about halfway through, that part where the giant appears and he has to fight it, when I read this as a kid, I remembered that being very near the end of the book.

491
00:28:58,485 --> 00:29:01,902
Speaker 1: And that appears to be at almost literally the halfway point of the book.

492
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:06,129
Speaker 1: And I know there's no giant glossary like in an R. Scott Bakker book.

493
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,321
Speaker 1: What the fuck happens when I remember in this book?

494
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,090
Speaker 0: Maybe the giant comes back again.

495
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:12,956
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

496
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:14,645
Speaker 1: Someone else big will come back later.

497
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,555
Speaker 1: I don't think you ran into the Tanari yet.

498
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:17,742
Speaker 0: I think I did.

499
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:18,787
Speaker 1: I think you might have.

500
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:20,255
Speaker 0: Pretty sure I did.

501
00:29:20,396 --> 00:29:20,677
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:21,783
Speaker 1: I think I know where you are.

503
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,250
Speaker 0: It's like the next chapter you're about to read.

504
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:23,651
Speaker 0: Yeah.

505
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:24,234
Speaker 1: I know.

506
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:24,556
Speaker 1: I know.

507
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:25,542
Speaker 1: I like that guy.

508
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:26,768
Speaker 0: Just randomly.

509
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,517
Speaker 0: It's like, by the way, there's a Tanari here.

510
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:43,190
Speaker 1: So, part of the problem with this book is that a lot of people, either people who read it, either read it as their introduction to Planescape as a setting, or they already read all the source material to Planescape and then they read this book.

511
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:48,758
Speaker 1: If you know a lot about the D&D world, this book reads very differently than if you don't.

512
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:51,069
Speaker 1: Do you know what a Tanari is?

513
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,913
Speaker 0: Some kind of demon.

514
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:52,376
Speaker 0: Yeah.

515
00:29:52,597 --> 00:29:53,341
Speaker 1: Do you know which other?

516
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,010
Speaker 1: It's one of the two kinds of demons.

517
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:55,915
Speaker 1: They're at war with each other.

518
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:56,438
Speaker 1: Right.

519
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:57,987
Speaker 0: In the Monster Manual, there's two kinds.

520
00:29:58,068 --> 00:29:58,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

521
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,110
Speaker 1: Remember how often in the Free Port game it mattered a lot which one it was?

522
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:04,072
Speaker 1: No.

523
00:30:04,153 --> 00:30:04,796
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

524
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:05,742
Speaker 0: I just remember pirates.

525
00:30:05,782 --> 00:30:10,084
Speaker 1: That came out kind of, every now and then a demon would appear, and some of us would be like, "Oh,

526
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:10,325
Speaker 1: shit.".

527
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:14,326
Speaker 1: And there would be an Ask an Alex really detailed questions about it to figure out which one it was.

528
00:30:14,608 --> 00:30:17,567
Speaker 1: So, we knew how to fight it, and Scott was just like, "Just a demon.

529
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:17,989
Speaker 1: Who cares?

530
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:19,556
Speaker 1: There's two kinds.

531
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:19,858
Speaker 1: Why does it

532
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:20,201
Speaker 1: matter?".

533
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:21,207
Speaker 0: Gotta use the cold iron.

534
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:21,570
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:23,354
Speaker 0: I know that much.

536
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,006
Speaker 1: Otherwise, stay tuned for stuff.

537
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:27,673
Speaker 1: I'm doing pre-production for a bunch of things.

538
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:37,120
Speaker 1: I also started, I'm gonna complete that thing where I was reading out loud the entirety of the novelization of Castlevania II Simon's Quest by FX9.

539
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:44,920
Speaker 1: I'm almost done reading the whole book, and I'm gonna post that audiobook in the Patreon if you want to read some even more painful pages.

540
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,810
Speaker 0: I want to see you get sued by whoever made that book.

541
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,874
Speaker 1: That'd be really funny.

542
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:50,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you just take it down.

543
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:50,325
Speaker 0: So, get this.

544
00:30:50,426 --> 00:30:51,290
Speaker 1: I Googled for the book.

545
00:30:52,112 --> 00:30:54,365
Speaker 1: The whole text of the book is just on a webpage.

546
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:55,833
Speaker 0: I'm sure it is, but, you know.

547
00:30:56,114 --> 00:31:01,039
Speaker 1: I'm actually reading from that webpage now because it's easier than reading from the physical book of which I have two copies.

548
00:31:02,105 --> 00:31:04,979
Speaker 1: One from when I was a kid, and one that I borrowed from Scott Johnson.

549
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,602
Speaker 0: Okay.

550
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:07,210
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

551
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:07,913
Speaker 1: Let's get into it.

552
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:08,596
Speaker 1: Whizzle!

553
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:35,870
Speaker 0: So, there's this thing, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and this thing has been out for a year plus, but I figure we haven't done an episode on it specifically, though I'm sure we've brought it up in the past, and it is very soon going to get major upgrades that are really quite astonishing, and as someone who has used Linux and Windows mostly for 30 years, but Linux for 20 plus years.

554
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:37,961
Speaker 1: Scott was using Linux long before I was.

555
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:38,785
Speaker 1: I never actually installed...

556
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:43,530
Speaker 0: I think I first used a Linux computer in like 1997 or 8.

557
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:56,575
Speaker 1: In high school, Ken had Linux on a box, and he did stuff with it, and when I got to RIT, the first time I ever installed Linux was I had an old Pentium 200, and I installed Linux on it for the hell of it.

558
00:31:56,596 --> 00:32:11,952
Speaker 1: I didn't have anything to do with it, so what I did then is I actually plugged a serial cable into it, and I plugged the other end of that serial cable into my computer, and then I would TTY into the Linux box from my computer with, like, terminal, and use it.

559
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:13,721
Speaker 0: Anyway, so...

560
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:14,444
Speaker 1: We old.

561
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:24,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, so back in the day, if you had a computer, and you wanted to run Linux, but you still needed Windows on that computer, maybe to play some games, you would do this thing called dual booting.

562
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:26,270
Speaker 1: Or, or Wine.

563
00:32:27,472 --> 00:32:29,302
Speaker 0: So the dual booting thing, the way that worked...

564
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:30,710
Speaker 1: Wine didn't work for anyone.

565
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:46,608
Speaker 0: Is you would basically cut your hard drive into pieces, you know, logically speaking, into partitions, and in your master boot record, you would install a bootloader, like Grub, and when your computer turned on, it would be a menu, and you would choose Windows, or you would choose Linux, or you would choose something else.

566
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:48,035
Speaker 0: You could have as many as you wanted, right?

567
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:59,432
Speaker 0: And you would put different operating systems in different parts of your hard drive, and different file systems, and so it would be like having multiple... You'd need a lot of storage, which is hard to come by in the late 90s, but later on, it wasn't so hard to come by.

568
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, late 90s, if you had more than one hard drive, that was a big deal.

569
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:05,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you would just restart your computer to switch operating systems, right?

570
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:14,810
Speaker 0: Max actually had a thing where you could switch between Mac OS, not OS X, Mac OS and DOS, by pressing a special key combination.

571
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,784
Speaker 0: I should look up how exactly that fucking worked, because I don't remember.

572
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:18,710
Speaker 0: I just remember that it did work.

573
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,150
Speaker 1: It's not like in the old, old days, where you'd have DOS, and you'd install Windows.

574
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,690
Speaker 0: It probably suspended one OS, and turned the other... I don't know.

575
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,276
Speaker 0: I'm going to look that up after the show.

576
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:30,385
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you dual booted for a long time.

577
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:32,515
Speaker 0: There was Wine, that Rym mentioned.

578
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:34,423
Speaker 0: Wine stands for... It's one of those...

579
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:35,950
Speaker 1: Wine is not an emulator.

580
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,518
Speaker 0: It's one of those self-referential things, right?

581
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:42,686
Speaker 0: So an emulator is a piece of software that literally emulates a chip, right?

582
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:45,078
Speaker 0: You have a chip that has an assembly language.

583
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,390
Speaker 0: You write a piece of software that takes in that assembly language, and basically converts it to the assembly language of the chip you actually have.

584
00:33:51,791 --> 00:34:02,670
Speaker 0: So you could have your much more powerful Pentium whatever pretend to be the chip of some other old Motorola Apple something, right?

585
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:11,029
Speaker 1: I actually am a Wine expert, because I actually supported an extensive Wine infrastructure at IBM.

586
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,045
Speaker 0: So what Wine did, basically, is you'd run it on Linux.

587
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:38,067
Speaker 0: You'd have a Linux computer running Linux, and you would have a Windows application say like Photoshop.exe, and you would type Wine Photoshop.exe and Wine would then take all of the Windows system calls that Photoshop.exe was trying to make, and convert them into Linux system calls, and get the Photoshop running on Linux.

588
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,431
Speaker 1: Now the way this worked in practice was you run it, and it fails.

589
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:49,681
Speaker 1: Then you figure out where it failed, and there'll be like one DLL is missing where the Wine DLL sucks.

590
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:52,416
Speaker 0: You had to mess with a bunch of configs and all sorts of garbage.

591
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:53,341
Speaker 1: No, you know what you really did?

592
00:34:53,400 --> 00:35:05,562
Speaker 1: You went to a real Windows computer, you took all the DLLs, you copied them to somewhere on your Linux computer, then you fucked around with configs for like a year, and then your application would work slowly and shittily.

593
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,854
Speaker 0: There were a few applications that worked really well.

594
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:14,306
Speaker 0: I remember I had a job where we needed Visio, and we had the last version of Visio before Microsoft bought it.

595
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:20,839
Speaker 0: So it was by the original company that made Visio, and it ran in Wine beautifully.

596
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:36,135
Speaker 1: My first major job, like the two things I did first as a technologist, and my first real job when I was working at IBM, was I got a whole bunch of this garbage legacy Windows software, like crazy software.

597
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:38,810
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say any names of these, because they might still be around.

598
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,713
Speaker 1: The software is shitty.

599
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:48,477
Speaker 1: And I got it all to work in Wine so we could deploy Linux desktops that ran this Windows software all over the factory floor.

600
00:35:48,738 --> 00:36:03,433
Speaker 0: Anyway, so to get down with it, so then as computers got more powerful, virtual machine technology became available to not just servers, but people in their homes, things like VirtualBox, VMware, all kinds of stuff, right, on OS X and Windows and Linux.

601
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:08,699
Speaker 0: Basically, what this is, is you have a piece of software that pretends to be a computer, right?

602
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,382
Speaker 0: You have a program that pretends to be a hard drive, a program that pretends to be a video card, right?

603
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:20,579
Speaker 0: And now you can just install boom, an operating system as a file in your file system, but it's pretending that it's a hard drive.

604
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:20,801
Speaker 0: Now,

605
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:41,670
Speaker 1: since I am not a developer, that basically solved most of my problems, because usually I needed to use Windows primarily, because I'm doing a bunch of Windows-y stuff in my real life, but then I'd want to do something in Linux for some reason, and I'd just spin up a machine, a virtual machine, and I'd tell that into it, or it has to say into it, and I'm good to go.

606
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:47,959
Speaker 0: Now the thing is, this is overkill for most uses, where people just need to run an application on a different OS.

607
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:57,870
Speaker 0: The only time you actually need to virtualize all that hardware is if you're actually doing work on that low level where you need to virtualize hardware.

608
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,420
Speaker 0: Most people just want to run the application.

609
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:05,426
Speaker 0: They don't need to virtualize the network card, right, or anything like that.

610
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:07,359
Speaker 0: They don't even want to have a virtual network at all.

611
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:08,790
Speaker 0: They just want to use the same network they've got.

612
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:10,455
Speaker 1: Now this is where that failed.

613
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,804
Speaker 1: We used to run Geek Nights.

614
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:22,288
Speaker 1: I had to use Linux to actually make Geek Nights, because I used some fancy software, Resound, and a bunch of scripting, and I had to make it work with this weird-ass sound.

615
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,690
Speaker 0: In those days, Adobe Audition was bad and cost a zillion dollars.

616
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,175
Speaker 0: It didn't even exist yet?

617
00:37:27,195 --> 00:37:39,371
Speaker 1: Well, so it technically existed because it was cool at it, and Adobe bought that company, and back then, I eventually paid for whatever, Creative Cloud 4, CS4.

618
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:40,277
Speaker 0: I don't know.

619
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:47,879
Speaker 1: So I had to dual-boot to make Geek Nights, and that was the last time I ran Linux natively on a computer.

620
00:37:48,362 --> 00:38:04,360
Speaker 0: So anyway, the point is that the reason I was only ever dual-booting and virtualizing Linux in the first place back in the day was because if I wanted to do any sort of software development work, Linux is actually better at that.

621
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:09,103
Speaker 0: Nothing a normal person wants to do with a computer is necessarily better on Linux.

622
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:10,993
Speaker 0: Maybe a handful of things, not really.

623
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:17,927
Speaker 0: The vast majority of things that a developer wants to do, though, are just better on a Unix/Linux operating system.

624
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:43,497
Speaker 0: This is why even though OS X is sort of a busted Unix with all these quirks, developers who are making, if you're not making a Windows app or a game or something like that where you're going to develop four Windows on Windows, the developer environment, all the tools for software development for making websites or pretty much anything are better on OS X and especially Linux or any kind of Unix OS.

625
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:46,009
Speaker 1: Yep, all my developers, they all work on OS X.

626
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:54,714
Speaker 0: I was dual-booting Linux all throughout college because I had to play Counter-Strike, so I dual-booted, but I was using Linux to do all my CS homework.

627
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:55,780
Speaker 0: You couldn't do it on Windows.

628
00:38:56,061 --> 00:39:01,590
Speaker 1: But get this, look at this, playing Counter-Strike had to be on Windows because running that on Linux sucked.

629
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,754
Speaker 1: You even got it to work.

630
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:08,101
Speaker 1: Running one in a Counter-Strike server, we had to run that on Linux because running that on Windows sucked.

631
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:08,804
Speaker 0: Exactly.

632
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:12,101
Speaker 0: Any kind of server stuff, you're not using any kind of Windows for that.

633
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:13,067
Speaker 0: You're using some kind of Nix.

634
00:39:13,288 --> 00:39:14,432
Speaker 0: Anyway, Star Nix.

635
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:16,965
Speaker 0: So, these were our options.

636
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:28,222
Speaker 0: Virtual machines, up until like two, three years ago, it was like just tell virtual machines on powerful computers was the way to go for convenience of running Windows natively, especially on a laptop.

637
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:30,413
Speaker 0: You don't have Linux messing up your laptop or anything.

638
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:36,865
Speaker 0: There are a lot of cases where people would run Linux directly on their laptop and it would mess them up, overheat or something, right?

639
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:43,621
Speaker 0: You get the proper Windows software running on the hardware directly, and then you just use a virtual machine to run the other software.

640
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:44,165
Speaker 0: you don't need to.

641
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:51,560
Speaker 0: Until Microsoft finally released on Windows 10 WSL 1, which is the Windows subsystem for Linux.

642
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,037
Speaker 0: And what this was is basically a lot like Wine.

643
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,750
Speaker 0: It's a lot like Wine, only backwards.

644
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,215
Speaker 0: Well, let's back up.

645
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:02,412
Speaker 1: The only reason Wine really sucked was that it was made It sucked.

646
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:03,939
Speaker 0: It wasn't a bad idea.

647
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:04,442
Speaker 0: It just sucked.

648
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,738
Speaker 1: It sucked because Microsoft actively opposed it.

649
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,984
Speaker 0: Well, that's also true.

650
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:09,990
Speaker 0: For a lot of reasons.

651
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:10,511
Speaker 0: Right.

652
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:24,742
Speaker 0: It's a lot easier, right, for the closed source developers of Windows who have access to all of Windows to then make something that runs all the software that is meant to run on the open source Linux kernel, right?

653
00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:31,698
Speaker 0: For the open source Linux developers to make a Wine thing that would run all possible Windows software.

654
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:39,941
Speaker 1: Because a lot of Wine development was literally like pick some random-ass Windows DLL, figure out what the hell it does, and reverse engineer it enough to make it equivalent.

655
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:40,303
Speaker 0: Right.

656
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:45,870
Speaker 0: So the way that first WSL 1, which is still the WSL that's available right now, it works.

657
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,277
Speaker 0: It's basically a lot like Wine.

658
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:52,665
Speaker 0: You go to the Microsoft App Store on Windows, and you find a Linux distribution.

659
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:53,349
Speaker 0: They're all in there.

660
00:40:54,030 --> 00:41:07,960
Speaker 0: Like Ubuntu, Debian, and you just click install, and then you open up your command, your PowerShell, your Windows even command prompt, and you type bash.exe, and bash.exe runs, and now you have Linux running.

661
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:13,627
Speaker 0: And if you want to get some GUI action you have to go and get your own separate X server, right?

662
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:15,416
Speaker 0: Because that's the way Linux GUIs work.

663
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:22,612
Speaker 0: So you can go get a vc xserv xming, or there's one that you can pay for, but it's supposedly okay, but you pay for it.

664
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:24,159
Speaker 0: It's not free like the two I just mentioned.

665
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,003
Speaker 0: There might be some others.

666
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:26,289
Speaker 0: You just run one.

667
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:34,110
Speaker 0: And then, now, if you execute some GUI apps in your little command prompt, they will show up in your X server that you're running.

668
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,919
Speaker 0: I don't think I have any... Because that's how Linux works.

669
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:38,029
Speaker 1: I don't think there's any GUI app I would ever need to run again.

670
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:38,832
Speaker 0: I don't know.

671
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:39,816
Speaker 1: But command line...

672
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:49,103
Speaker 0: So the way that I use WSL for my work is now I don't have to do any virtual machine bullshit, right?

673
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:50,993
Speaker 0: I run the X server.

674
00:41:51,817 --> 00:42:00,823
Speaker 0: I have a little script I double click on a shortcut and a full screen Linux desktop environment runs in the second monitor.

675
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:01,969
Speaker 0: Just boom, there it is.

676
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:12,903
Speaker 0: Or, if I don't have two monitors, I turn that mode off and I just run Linux apps in separate little windows and they're just like there, right next to my Windows windows, all together in the same thing.

677
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,294
Speaker 0: You wouldn't even know which ones are which.

678
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:17,083
Speaker 0: And it works great.

679
00:42:17,665 --> 00:42:20,118
Speaker 0: But this WSL 1 had a few problems, right?

680
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:29,765
Speaker 0: So the problems it had is, number one, really bad file system performance, like noticeable, versus accessing the file system directly.

681
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:40,420
Speaker 1: Which is interesting because that was one of the primary issues Wine had, and that was also one of the primary issues that you had dual booting, because dual boot, back then, it was very hard to read a Windows formatted...

682
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,014
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not talking about reading opposite file systems.

683
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:43,878
Speaker 0: I'm talking about just...

684
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:44,943
Speaker 1: I/O is slow?

685
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:47,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, just I/O is really bad in WSL 1.

686
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:49,370
Speaker 0: It's noticeably slow.

687
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:57,410
Speaker 0: The other problem is a lot of the system calls of Linux just don't work in WSL, like the main ones do, right?

688
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,957
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of them that don't.

689
00:42:58,997 --> 00:43:06,777
Speaker 0: And you'll see, if you go to the WSL bug reports, there's lists and lists of people trying to do specific things, like run Wireshark, for example.

690
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:07,280
Speaker 0: It won't work.

691
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:10,294
Speaker 0: You can't run Wireshark in WSL 1.

692
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:16,405
Speaker 0: It will not happen, because the system calls it needs to access the network card that are not available in WSL 1.

693
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:18,375
Speaker 1: Wireshark is a native Windows app, so...

694
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:21,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people want to run the Linux one for whatever reason.

695
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why.

696
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:23,963
Speaker 0: Or similar apps, also, right?

697
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:24,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

698
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:31,400
Speaker 0: They want to run debugging apps, and certain debugging system calls, and they're not implemented in WSL 1, they won't work, right?

699
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:49,714
Speaker 0: You know, it has issues, but for the most part, if you want to run Linux apps, you don't want to dual boot and reboot your computer every time, and you don't need to virtualize it, because you're not doing anything that requires virtualization, WSL 1 is the way to go, it's really easy, it totally works, it's pretty great.

700
00:43:50,498 --> 00:43:52,990
Speaker 0: But, there's two major problems.

701
00:43:53,250 --> 00:44:00,507
Speaker 0: Problem number one, if you're not doing the GUI thing like I'm doing, where I'm running, I'm actually running, like, the gnome terminal, right?

702
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:19,738
Speaker 0: I'm running the Linux terminal emulator in WSL, in a GUI, so that I don't have to use Windows command prompt, cmd.exe, that thing's garbage, or PowerShell, which is much better, but it's not great, it's not even as good as Xterm, right?

703
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:24,250
Speaker 0: WSL is kind of meh, you have to use one of those two terminals, unless you do the trick that I'm using, right?

704
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,964
Speaker 0: Like, run Xterm, or run RXVT, or something else.

705
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:39,003
Speaker 0: Microsoft just announced, at their developer thing, they're making a new Windows terminal, and it appears to be the God terminal, like, they learned like, oh, that's what a real terminal's fucking like, alright.

706
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:46,038
Speaker 0: So, Windows itself, without having to, you know, do some shenanigans, will have a legit awesome terminal.

707
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:55,283
Speaker 0: Even on OSX, they have terminal, which is better than any Windows terminal, but OSX users, Mac users, all of them install iTerm or iTerm2, right?

708
00:44:56,088 --> 00:44:58,420
Speaker 0: They don't use the garbage OSX terminal.

709
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:01,732
Speaker 0: But at least the garbage OSX terminal has tabs, right?

710
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:06,982
Speaker 0: But no, now Microsoft is making a real terminal that will be out at some point in the future-ish.

711
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:16,430
Speaker 1: So, does this, 'cause Linux on the desktop is already a ship that sailed and then sank, I feel like this is a nail in that submerged coffin.

712
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,952
Speaker 1: Probably.

713
00:45:17,113 --> 00:45:19,304
Speaker 1: Like, why would you ever run Linux on your desktop?

714
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:20,832
Speaker 0: Maybe there's some good reason, I don't know.

715
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:24,330
Speaker 1: I mean, unless your desktop is actually just a server?

716
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,444
Speaker 0: There's just a lot less good reasons, but there are fewer reasons.

717
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:34,741
Speaker 1: I mean, if it's just a server, like, I'm not gonna even put Windows on a NAS box, I'm gonna run just Linux on it, but...

718
00:45:35,685 --> 00:45:37,515
Speaker 0: There's some reasons, but not so many.

719
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,452
Speaker 0: But yeah, so the other big thing is WSL2.

720
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:48,509
Speaker 0: So, WSL2, I watched a whole, like, hour-long video where, like, the main developer of it, like, explained what's going on.

721
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:59,986
Speaker 0: It, basically, you won't notice many differences from WSL1 when you use it, but you do have to convert your WSL1 to WSL2 in order to make it happen, right?

722
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:01,193
Speaker 0: And what's actually?

723
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:06,340
Speaker 0: WSL2 actually is not doing the wine thing, it's actually virtualization.

724
00:46:06,983 --> 00:46:09,395
Speaker 0: But it's, like, they call it, like, this lightweight VM.

725
00:46:09,456 --> 00:46:11,970
Speaker 0: It's not, like, a real kind of VM, right?

726
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,550
Speaker 1: Well, this demo is already someone starting a Docker from the command line.

727
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:25,938
Speaker 0: Yes, because they have switched to doing this virtualization thing, this sort of lightweight virtualization, instead of doing the wine thing, every system call works.

728
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:32,290
Speaker 0: You can run every Linux app, including ridiculous shit like Docker, in WSL.

729
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,275
Speaker 1: Alright, 20% faster.

730
00:46:33,295 --> 00:46:33,456
Speaker 1: Right.

731
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:37,881
Speaker 1: And full system call compatibility.

732
00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:38,223
Speaker 1: Yep.

733
00:46:38,485 --> 00:47:00,954
Speaker 0: So, basically, the only major difference you're going to notice between WSL1 and 2 is the file system is way better because you're just accessing the file system, whereas in WSL1, if you wanted to access the Windows file system from Linux, you had to mount using, like, this DriveFS thing, you would mount the Windows file system in, like, mount/c, right?

734
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:10,020
Speaker 0: And then you could access it from Windows from Linux, but there was no way to access Linux from Windows very safely, right, using WSL1.

735
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:13,174
Speaker 0: It was kind of okay, some things, but not really.

736
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,646
Speaker 0: Now, it's totally safe.

737
00:47:15,948 --> 00:47:25,356
Speaker 0: They've used Plan 9 to basically create these automatic network mounts between WSL virtual machine and Windows.

738
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,728
Speaker 0: So, it's basically perfect.

739
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:33,980
Speaker 0: lightning fast, you know, file system access between the two worlds just directly, right?

740
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:44,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, so WSL2 is looking like, I mean, every system call, which means literally every Linux app just about, I'm sure someone will find one that doesn't work.

741
00:47:45,054 --> 00:47:45,778
Speaker 1: I'm sure they will.

742
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:46,662
Speaker 1: Or will they?

743
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:49,416
Speaker 0: But it's basically everything's just going to run.

744
00:47:49,437 --> 00:47:51,869
Speaker 0: So, basically, Windows now is Linux.

745
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:55,688
Speaker 0: Every Linux app ever will just run on Windows directly.

746
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:03,710
Speaker 1: I guess what will be interesting to see is, in the long run, does this cause a shift back to Windows for software developers?

747
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I feel like, you know...

748
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:09,758
Speaker 1: Because a Windows laptop is, like, twice as powerful as the most powerful Mac.

749
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is what I don't get.

750
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:15,205
Speaker 0: I don't understand how I see so many developers out there.

751
00:48:15,386 --> 00:48:26,302
Speaker 0: I see, you know, the open source guys at Linux laptops, but most people I see using Mac laptops, like, develop stuff, and are like, man, using that Homebrew and stuff, it's like, I guess it works, but it's really garbage-y.

752
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:37,116
Speaker 0: I've been preferring virtual machines on Windows to Mac for development for a long-ass time, and WSL only cemented it and made my life way better.

753
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:47,367
Speaker 0: I don't see why you would still want to develop... If you're not developing iOS apps, I still don't understand why you would use a Mac instead of using Windows plus WSL.

754
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:48,573
Speaker 1: And I suspect...

755
00:48:48,674 --> 00:48:49,719
Speaker 0: Especially WSL2.

756
00:48:50,342 --> 00:48:57,337
Speaker 1: I suspect after WSL2 is out, I think we will see people bit by bit going back to Windows.

757
00:48:57,357 --> 00:49:01,177
Speaker 1: Or, at least, developers who start on Windows will stay on Windows.

758
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:03,708
Speaker 0: I think the better terminals is really going to make it more a thing.

759
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:04,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

760
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,226
Speaker 0: Because setting up the X server is a bit much...

761
00:49:07,246 --> 00:49:10,607
Speaker 1: Well, setting up the X server has been a pain in the ass for as long as I have known what that was.

762
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:11,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

763
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:20,815
Speaker 0: I had to make a V script that executes a bat file that does a thing to... Anyway.

764
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:29,617
Speaker 0: The other major difference that you may or may not notice is that in WSL1, let's say I run Postgres.

765
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:31,488
Speaker 0: It's running on port whatever it runs on.

766
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,310
Speaker 0: That's just on... If I run a web server, it's running on port 80.

767
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,235
Speaker 0: Or port 8000.

768
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,481
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll put it on port 8000.

769
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:41,842
Speaker 0: I can just open up my Windows browser and go to localhost 8000.

770
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:43,110
Speaker 0: It's just running on the same network.

771
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,156
Speaker 0: It's not a separate thing.

772
00:49:45,176 --> 00:49:48,250
Speaker 0: In WSL2, it is going to be a separate IP address.

773
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:51,202
Speaker 0: Because it's a virtual machine still.

774
00:49:51,524 --> 00:49:53,757
Speaker 0: Even though it's this lightweight VM.

775
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:59,930
Speaker 0: So that is a slight annoyance because I really like just doing stuff like... I was doing like Netcat, right?

776
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,777
Speaker 0: From WSL1 to the same machine.

777
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,657
Speaker 0: But now it's going to be different IP addresses.

778
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:06,641
Speaker 0: It's going to be a little trickier.

779
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:11,084
Speaker 1: God, I remember at one point I actually set up an environment because I was running like four different VMs.

780
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:13,556
Speaker 0: But maybe I won't have to use Netcat if the file system is better.

781
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,340
Speaker 1: True.

782
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:14,440
Speaker 1: Yeah.

783
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:16,370
Speaker 1: I just remember having to.

784
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:24,230
Speaker 1: I'd actually set up my virtualized networks with all these hard coded IP addresses so the servers all ran in their own areas and I didn't have port conflicts.

785
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,210
Speaker 1: But that was mostly because I was doing weird enterprise-y Java software nonsense.

786
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:39,790
Speaker 0: So, if you are a software developer or if you have some reason to use Linux for whatever reason and you don't want to actually run Linux, run Windows.

787
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,259
Speaker 0: You can get WSL for free.

788
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,445
Speaker 0: You just install that shit.

789
00:50:43,847 --> 00:50:44,751
Speaker 0: You go to the Windows store.

790
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,440
Speaker 0: You install whatever distro is available there.

791
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,585
Speaker 0: I hope your favorite distro is there.

792
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:48,871
Speaker 0: I mean, all the major ones are there.

793
00:50:48,932 --> 00:50:50,298
Speaker 0: Ubuntu, Debian, whatever.

794
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:51,665
Speaker 1: What about my Gen 2?

795
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:51,986
Speaker 0: I don't know.

796
00:50:52,006 --> 00:50:52,549
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

797
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:55,548
Speaker 0: And you're good to go.

798
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:06,601
Speaker 0: Another related change, I don't know if we discussed this at Geek Nights before, it's somewhat related but not really, is that Windows, you can now get the real open SSH for Windows.

799
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:08,129
Speaker 0: And that's one of the things where it's like.

800
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:12,050
Speaker 0: Windows came with Telnet and FTP and all these other things.

801
00:51:12,633 --> 00:51:15,509
Speaker 0: But getting SSH on Windows, you always had to use PuTTY.

802
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,343
Speaker 0: You had to get an application to do SSH on Windows.

803
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:19,228
Speaker 1: We've talked about this before.

804
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:23,890
Speaker 1: PuTTY is a great application that has a website that looks like it is fake.

805
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:25,458
Speaker 1: Yes.

806
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:28,577
Speaker 1: But... GRX.GreenEnd.org.UK/Username/PuTTY.

807
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:38,098
Speaker 0: But, starting a while ago, many months, perhaps even like up to a year ago I don't know how long ago they did this.

808
00:51:38,782 --> 00:51:43,485
Speaker 0: Microsoft made an official build of open SSH for Windows.

809
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:44,450
Speaker 0: This isn't WSL.

810
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:51,424
Speaker 0: This is, you're on Windows, you open the command prompt.exe and this open SSH, or just SSH.exe.

811
00:51:53,494 --> 00:51:54,319
Speaker 0: it's a Windows app.

812
00:51:55,304 --> 00:51:57,677
Speaker 0: You run SSH on Windows as a native app.

813
00:51:57,797 --> 00:51:58,521
Speaker 1: It just works.

814
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,030
Speaker 0: You don't need PuTTY anymore.

815
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:01,433
Speaker 0: Right?

816
00:52:01,514 --> 00:52:07,185
Speaker 0: And especially, PuTTY though, for as meh as it is it's still a better terminal than PowerShell or CMD.

817
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:13,679
Speaker 0: So once this Windows terminal comes out though, right, you open that and type SSH.exe.

818
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:24,390
Speaker 0: and now if you're just someone who needed you know, if you're just SSHing two Linux machines as opposed to needing to run anything locally, you won't even need to install WSL.

819
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:33,035
Speaker 0: You just get your Linux servers on Linode or OZ or wherever you're hosting your Linux servers, maybe under your desk, you get a Windows machine, just SSH into them.

820
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:39,144
Speaker 0: That's how I do development on my iPad, is I have an app you can get for the iPad called Blink, I think.

821
00:52:39,164 --> 00:52:44,874
Speaker 0: It's just a SSH or mosh, which is like a mobile SSH, mosh it's pretty cool.

822
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:48,894
Speaker 0: And I just connect to a server and now I can do Linux development from my iPad.

823
00:52:48,914 --> 00:52:55,324
Speaker 1: It just surprised me my whole adult life that there was no native SSH client in Windows.

824
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,615
Speaker 0: PuTTY has been around for how long?

825
00:52:57,635 --> 00:52:59,123
Speaker 1: Oh, forever?

826
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:03,430
Speaker 0: And it took until 2019 to finally kill PuTTY.

827
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:06,204
Speaker 0: And PuTTY is currently- Microsoft finally done did it.

828
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:07,470
Speaker 1: You wanna know how stable PuTTY was?

829
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,240
Speaker 1: You know what the current version number of PuTTY is?

830
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,542
Speaker 1: Yeah.

831
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,451
Speaker 1: 0.71.

832
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:12,435
Speaker 0: Okay.

833
00:53:13,279 --> 00:53:17,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, version numbering doesn't, you know, I'm not a fan of people's weird version number systems.

834
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:17,842
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,188
Speaker 0: I'm now all about going.

836
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:23,190
Speaker 0: one two, three, four, give me these dots, you don't need dots.

837
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,176
Speaker 0: Alright, one, two, three.

838
00:53:25,196 --> 00:53:27,107
Speaker 1: Come on, I need major.minor.patch.

839
00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:27,590
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

840
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:28,734
Speaker 0: You don't need that.

841
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:29,763
Speaker 0: One, two, three, four.

842
00:53:30,448 --> 00:53:30,630
Speaker 1: Okay.

843
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:37,723
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

844
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:42,730
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
