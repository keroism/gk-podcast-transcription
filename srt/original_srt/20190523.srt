1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,000
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,407
Speaker 1: It's Thursday May 23rd 2019.

3
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:15,900
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm sky and this is geek nights tonight not late to this party at all.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,515
Speaker 1: We are reviewing the 1999 film The Matrix 20th anniversary.

5
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:23,219
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:30,649
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's a nice out finally biking to work like every day except today Except today.

7
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:35,460
Speaker 1: and it was funny cuz I got up and I was like oh I should bike to work and I look outside and it has that look of it.

8
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:38,738
Speaker 0: I already knew I wasn't gonna bike to work today cuz a I was going to the doctor after.

9
00:00:38,758 --> 00:00:39,563
Speaker 0: yeah I'm sort of.

10
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,878
Speaker 0: I left work early go to the doctor and then came here.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,540
Speaker 0: But be I checked the weather religiously like all the fucking time that I knew it was gonna rain today.

12
00:00:47,662 --> 00:00:57,012
Speaker 1: Yep, so I'm at work and of course the problem was it was only raining while I would have had to bike to work and then it was like sunny and Nice for most of the day and then it was rainy again.

13
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,780
Speaker 1: right as I would have by tome.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,487
Speaker 1: It only rained at the times.

15
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:01,431
Speaker 1: I would have been biking.

16
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:02,355
Speaker 0: That's when it likes to rain.

17
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:04,462
Speaker 1: I know it knows It's like us.

18
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:05,447
Speaker 1: rim got his bike out.

19
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,277
Speaker 1: Hahaha Zeus and Poseidon are both just like.

20
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:08,959
Speaker 1: yeah, fuck him up.

21
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:12,439
Speaker 1: So I was thinking of Poseidon because the pages of pain.

22
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,259
Speaker 0: I've not read any more painful pages since we last.

23
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:20,333
Speaker 1: So all I will say about that is that I had all the painful.

24
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:21,418
Speaker 1: I know but I'm real.

25
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:25,471
Speaker 1: near the end I hit the point where I remember the first time I read the book.

26
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:34,220
Speaker 1: it kind of accelerates like the last bit is one long And I kind of just read that in one go as a kid because I was just like what the fuck is going.

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:42,392
Speaker 1: Oh and all the bad all the really bad things just happened like one after another And I forgot about something pretty horrifying that happened.

28
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:43,917
Speaker 0: I'm sure many harv.

29
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,740
Speaker 0: It's the pages of pain.

30
00:01:44,780 --> 00:02:02,030
Speaker 1: it's not the pages so pleasant if the if the to Sally if the hands getting cut off is like a level for painful and The foot thing like that's maybe a level six this is like Seems like it's ten and then you realize it's eleven.

31
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,823
Speaker 1: and that ain't even the worst thing that happens in this bike cut off to Replace a nose.

32
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:07,189
Speaker 1: It's pretty worse than you.

33
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,151
Speaker 1: It's pretty bad.

34
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,056
Speaker 1: It's pretty gruesome.

35
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,148
Speaker 1: It's uh It's painful pages are happening here.

36
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:24,760
Speaker 1: All right, but the one thing I can say about biking is that because I ride a hybrid like a Performance hybrid bike kind of the way I've ridden mountain bikes my whole life.

37
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:29,719
Speaker 1: I actually took the time to fully inspect my my rear cassettes actually a really good shape.

38
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:35,620
Speaker 1: My chain is stretched to a laughable degree Because I haven't been doing anything.

39
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,179
Speaker 1: I've been not maintaining my chain for shit.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,584
Speaker 0: Apparently what what's supposed?

41
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,394
Speaker 0: the deal is right is you have a chain and the cassette and it.

42
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,140
Speaker 0: the chain gets stretched over time Yeah, and then that will erode the cassette.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,620
Speaker 0: So usually you want to replace them together and just even though a cassette looks like it would be an expensive part.

44
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:50,367
Speaker 0: It's really not.

45
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:51,800
Speaker 0: It's just a bunch of gears in a stack.

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,420
Speaker 1: It's kind of a pain to replace it, but I'll have the bike shop do it.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,628
Speaker 1: They charge like nothing to do that.

48
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:56,373
Speaker 0: It's not actually that hard.

49
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,380
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's not hard.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,311
Speaker 1: It's just annoying because I don't have a lift like put my bike.

51
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:02,340
Speaker 0: is that if you replace your chain?

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:14,388
Speaker 0: When it gets stretched and the cassette is still in good shape a plus Yes you can usually get a new chain on there and get two chains per cassette and that is what you do if you're a Responsible bike owner who doesn't?

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,540
Speaker 0: but it's a regular set are mismatched.

54
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:20,800
Speaker 0: What happens is like the chain will slip over the gears.

55
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:33,800
Speaker 0: It's like you'll pedal and like the chain is spinning around But it like over the gears of the cassettes over the spikes and it goes like That'll happen if the cassette is bad or the chain is bad, right?

56
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,531
Speaker 0: And that's what you're trying to avoid.

57
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:39,642
Speaker 1: or if the chain is bad But the cassette is brand new and perfect You'll get the opposite.

58
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:50,740
Speaker 1: the chain will stay in the gears around the corner usually on the front and then pull up behind And loop under itself and that just causes an instant faceplant.

59
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:56,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it is it's called chainsaw and I'm afraid more more afraid of that than I am of terrorists.

60
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,237
Speaker 0: I mean, you could just be afraid of like a stick in the wheel.

61
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:02,188
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm more afraid of chainsaw because stick in the wheel.

62
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:11,040
Speaker 1: I assume if a stick goes into my wheel Someone did it on purpose and I probably am aware that I have an enemy who's attempting to do this to me.

63
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:16,180
Speaker 1: I doubt a random hobo is gonna stick out like a broom through my spokes randomly on the street.

64
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,789
Speaker 1: I'm more afraid of chainsaw than I am Just push people on the subway tracks.

65
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,411
Speaker 1: That is true.

66
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:28,366
Speaker 1: That is in fact true I encountered a really really aggressive hobo yesterday actually, okay But they didn't like it wasn't?

67
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,520
Speaker 1: it wasn't even on the level of worth talking about on geek nights.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,785
Speaker 1: It's just I thought of it just now.

69
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,460
Speaker 1: it was below the gutter punk who threatened to stab me in Portland.

70
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:44,479
Speaker 1: Hmm, which that's now the bar I won't talk about a hobo unless they're above the line of had a knife at my back and threatened to stab me with it.

71
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,374
Speaker 1: Okay So, uh, I love all our friends in the West Coast are like, oh you're in that Riverside Park Park.

72
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'll happen there.

73
00:04:51,337 --> 00:05:08,304
Speaker 1: Okay but But the last thing I'll say about biking is now that I'm biking to work every day I'm reminded of one of the most painful no sees that I have That the vast majority of people who own a bike in New York City Possibly the world.

74
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,372
Speaker 1: but I'm just focusing on New York City because that's the data.

75
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,319
Speaker 1: I these are the data that I have.

76
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:23,179
Speaker 1: Have no idea how bikes work and Like just they use a bike without understanding what any of the things on the bike do except the pedals.

77
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,484
Speaker 1: kinda Yep, they're in the wrong gear.

78
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:26,908
Speaker 1: Like they've clearly never.

79
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,716
Speaker 1: they've never attempted to squeeze their front brake at any point.

80
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:42,380
Speaker 1: I Love it when I see someone who is biking and the chain is making that sound of you are between gears Your bike is desperately trying to shift and can't and that's just how they bike.

81
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,926
Speaker 0: I don't know how people bike with like.

82
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:47,563
Speaker 0: I see his bike or the drivetrain is just made of rust and it's like it's still Working.

83
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:48,593
Speaker 0: I'm like, how are you riding that?

84
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,319
Speaker 0: How does that even work?

85
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:58,386
Speaker 0: Well, I remember when my bike got stolen and beacon one of the things the dude clearly didn't know how to ride a bike Because I see tons of people way more fit than me and I'm just going right by him Yeah, and they don't see it.

86
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:05,059
Speaker 1: I'm like, alright, but he had cut the Control wire to the front gear because I don't think he knew how it worked.

87
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,480
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, so it would like you basically locked the bike in one gear and there was no way to change gears.

88
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,548
Speaker 1: That's one of the modifications.

89
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:15,180
Speaker 1: He made to it when he was riding it around before I stole it back.

90
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,591
Speaker 1: So anyway, I got some news.

91
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,459
Speaker 1: I think we had an update on our.

92
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:23,509
Speaker 0: It's not a big news, but the gig nights follow-up.

93
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,236
Speaker 0: We just did that Pokemon t-shirt story on Tuesday.

94
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:41,660
Speaker 0: So the person who Submitted that t-shirt was D queued from the contest Yep, and it appears that the $10,000 prize will go to nobody Because the second apparently one of the other finalists was also disqualified for the same reason.

95
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:44,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I guess Uniqlo and Pokemon together were like, you know what?

96
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:44,659
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

97
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,758
Speaker 0: And then it also appears that no that the t-shirt was supposed to appear in Pokemon sword and shield.

98
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:51,420
Speaker 0: that ain't happen.

99
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,437
Speaker 0: That will not happen.

100
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:56,112
Speaker 0: However, everyone's like, oh, it's probably gonna be in the game.

101
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,400
Speaker 0: So you got to do some data mining find it, right?

102
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they probably programmed it already or whatever.

103
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:04,151
Speaker 0: So, yeah, that's interesting.

104
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:05,419
Speaker 0: see what happens there.

105
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,525
Speaker 1: yep, so, uh, the leave will be when pay.

106
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:15,910
Speaker 1: actually like tried to work it out with them is from what I can tell and Uniqlo Didn't respond and just ended everything.

107
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,108
Speaker 1: They basically just walked away from this whole situation And apparently they don't know which.

108
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:23,040
Speaker 0: I don't know if Uniqlo or Nintendo were the ones paying out the prize.

109
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:42,580
Speaker 1: I believe Uniqlo was because here's what the rules of the thing actually said Uniqlo may withdraw prizes and or and or terminate merchandising of t-shirts with winning artworks without prior notice to the entrant Irrespective of the originality of the artwork submitted the entrant if similar artwork is already publicly available outside Uniqlo stores.

110
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:51,692
Speaker 1: so if I made a completely original design that was Similar to an existing design that I may or may not have known about.

111
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,537
Speaker 0: basically they have lawyers.

112
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,420
Speaker 0: They covered their ass.

113
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,267
Speaker 0: The ass covering was sufficient.

114
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:01,440
Speaker 1: In fact, if I submitted something nice butt armor, it's yep.

115
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:06,194
Speaker 1: So basically everyone walked away from this and the whole contest just ended in failure.

116
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:06,756
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:07,980
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

118
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:10,018
Speaker 1: I think the moral is don't enter our contest.

119
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:14,958
Speaker 0: Regardless there will still be some nice Pokemon shirts on sale at Uniqlo.

120
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:15,440
Speaker 0: Don't you worry?

121
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:24,320
Speaker 1: I feel like what we're gonna see is that lower tier anime cons This exact t-shirt will be sold by bootleggers in the artist alley.

122
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:32,827
Speaker 1: I think that's what we're gonna see like 100% and I want you all to post pictures of this when you find it at Your local friendly anime convention.

123
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,573
Speaker 0: You should make a parody of the shirt.

124
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,546
Speaker 1: I should it's a parrot Make some sort of joke about Uniqlo.

125
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:42,398
Speaker 0: I don't know what else has a long thing in three dot things.

126
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,667
Speaker 1: I don't know I could come over something.

127
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:50,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in some other news This is gaming news, but we're gonna focus more on the political angle.

128
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,825
Speaker 1: So there is a.

129
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,972
Speaker 0: it's not that it just because it's Thursday not Tuesday.

130
00:08:54,033 --> 00:09:02,500
Speaker 1: Whatever those are there is a bill in Congress of the United States that has and this is shockingly like if you don't live in the u.s.

131
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,948
Speaker 1: Bipartisan bills right don't exist anymore.

132
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:07,473
Speaker 0: Well, it's because they do.

133
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,580
Speaker 0: they're just usually things you never hear about cuz you don't care about.

134
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:16,183
Speaker 1: Well, no, usually they are the bills that are literally necessary to be passed for the government to keep running The bill.

135
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:22,600
Speaker 0: so that's not gonna be reported in the news though unless they lose bipartisan support right which happens actually.

136
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:31,586
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is that Much like the country of Belgium which banned pretty much all Gambling stuff in games whatsoever.

137
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:44,960
Speaker 1: Yeah Belgian so far China, which also has banned almost similar to Belgium Belgium and gambling in games Even if that gambling is virtual to the point that blizzard said they just won't sell their games there anymore.

138
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,241
Speaker 0: That's right.

139
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:50,540
Speaker 0: China is banning but also went further into limiting other forms of speech like violence and such.

140
00:09:51,142 --> 00:10:02,871
Speaker 0: but the United the bill that's in the Senate right now is only what it says is if your game has random shit like loot boxes, yeah or Pay to win shit, right?

141
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,358
Speaker 0: Even if it is not random.

142
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:20,640
Speaker 0: Yep And you're selling this game to minors then you can't do that you have to basically go through great measures to make sure that People under the age of 18 are not playing your game and then you can do some of this gambling biz.

143
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:25,879
Speaker 1: I would argue this is actually a good thing for the industry because you know, it's gonna happen.

144
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:31,680
Speaker 1: Everyone who wants to play these games who is under 18 will play them anyway and buy them with their parents credit card and everything.

145
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,202
Speaker 1: You'll be fine.

146
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:36,256
Speaker 1: Just like how everyone certifies when they make an account on anything.

147
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,560
Speaker 0: Everyone sees porn online.

148
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:44,018
Speaker 1: They're all everyone's over the age of 13 whether you're 8 or 80 because you're not allowed to actually provide services to children under COPPA.

149
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:52,181
Speaker 1: so No one almost no one makes a website that technically lets you use it in any way if you're under the age of 13.

150
00:10:52,181 --> 00:11:05,660
Speaker 0: Right, but hopefully what this will do is, you know The the industry most industries video game industry included right are of the opinion Like you we have to self-regulate to a degree such so that the government will not come and regulate.

151
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,004
Speaker 1: I'm pretty okay.

152
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:11,800
Speaker 0: And then when the government comes to regulate they say no no, no, let us self-regulate like Facebook.

153
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,000
Speaker 0: No, no, no Let us regulate ourselves.

154
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,300
Speaker 1: Well, cuz here's a fine point on this if you're not aware people think you gotta be at Fox watch the n-house.

155
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,466
Speaker 0: We will do a good job.

156
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:20,968
Speaker 0: Trust us.

157
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,721
Speaker 1: people think you have to be 18 to do things Like.

158
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:30,740
Speaker 1: well, I guess back when blockbuster existed to rent an adult video You needed to be 18 by law to see an R-rated movie.

159
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,632
Speaker 1: You got to be 18 to buy the ticket to buy a violent video game.

160
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:33,833
Speaker 1: get it.

161
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,279
Speaker 1: None of those things are laws.

162
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:41,512
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm when I was a kid I went to see R-rated movies like when I was 13 14 by myself.

163
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:46,100
Speaker 1: all the time theater would gladly sell me a ticket Because there was no law about that.

164
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,179
Speaker 0: There were some theaters that voluntarily would try to prevent you.

165
00:11:49,461 --> 00:12:01,060
Speaker 1: But if look basically if local parents made a big deal about it local theaters would enforce these Optional rules these self-regulated rules that the industry would put together just to keep the lawsuits away.

166
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:12,725
Speaker 1: so it's kind of the same thing with a lot of video game stuff and This law would actually force compliance or at least force Ostensible compliance.

167
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:25,320
Speaker 0: the most interesting part of the law is simply that they attempted to in legal terms Define what counts as pay to win in a court of law Which I'm kind of excited about because fuck pay to win.

168
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,862
Speaker 0: That's right.

169
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:31,759
Speaker 1: Like I want to use a blunt hammer to end anyone's ability to sell video game I really need a win.

170
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:36,860
Speaker 0: There's also a couple related stories and a. I would like to whisper into some.

171
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,569
Speaker 0: Lavi a be a lobbyist so I could whisper in some ears.

172
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,512
Speaker 0: obvious would be a good job and be like, hey, you know Pokemon cards and magic cards are basically the same thing.

173
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,858
Speaker 0: Why don't we apply this to those two?

174
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,340
Speaker 0: And be The ESA which if you don't know is basically like the RA for video games.

175
00:12:55,522 --> 00:13:01,800
Speaker 0: It is like a bunch of you know Lawyers and lobbyists for the video game industry that are supposed to make sure the government doesn't do things like this.

176
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:05,940
Speaker 1: Arguably, they failed because their job was to make sure laws like this don't appear.

177
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,264
Speaker 0: Well many people.

178
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:14,359
Speaker 0: the ESA does two things it lobbies the government, right and it helps fight You know for the video game industry's interest in court.

179
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:17,088
Speaker 0: And it runs e3 and the.

180
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:23,769
Speaker 0: basically the members of the ESA are not happy with pretty much anything The ESA does is doing a real bad job.

181
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:24,793
Speaker 1: E3 is a shit show.

182
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:26,700
Speaker 0: It's doing a real bad job across the board.

183
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:33,246
Speaker 0: They want e3 to be split off into its own thing and the ESA is doing real bad a job at lobbying Which is why these kind of laws are coming out.

184
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:38,000
Speaker 0: So the downfall of the ESA has been in the news recently as well.

185
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:47,639
Speaker 0: So it's interesting coincidence that here comes a whole something an example of the ESA doing a bad job At least at its goals whether if you agree with those goals or not.

186
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:53,089
Speaker 1: Right after there were stories about the ESA suck What I am very happy about is the law seems to have.

187
00:13:53,109 --> 00:14:00,209
Speaker 0: I feel like if today there was a story about rim being real bad at Jumping or walking and then next week.

188
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:01,996
Speaker 0: There was a story about rim tripping over his own feet.

189
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:05,408
Speaker 1: Yep, basically But this law fell down and hurt himself.

190
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:10,959
Speaker 0: I like how the bill and I just read an article last week about Walking and that was the article about rim falling over.

191
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:20,052
Speaker 1: But the bill is very focused on the things we're actually mad about and it is not in any way about Violence about content.

192
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:21,340
Speaker 1: it is literally clearly.

193
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,480
Speaker 0: It's one of those ones where there's no senator in the Senate who knows a fuck all about any of this.

194
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:27,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

195
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,268
Speaker 0: so it's clearly written by some congressional staff.

196
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:35,293
Speaker 0: like most things are you know who are intelligent and know what's up and The reason the senators support it?

197
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:41,900
Speaker 0: because yeah This is to crack down on get kids gambling like oh pretty much any old white person can get behind that.

198
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,766
Speaker 0: Yep, so there you go.

199
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:48,260
Speaker 1: also quote from the article under the protecting children from abusive games act.

200
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,938
Speaker 1: there you go, and they define abuse as basically addictive shit and Manipulating them to get money out of them.

201
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
Speaker 1: Yep Like that's kind of.

202
00:14:56,404 --> 00:15:05,137
Speaker 1: it says games that are marketed to children would be prohibited from implementing any pay-to-win Mechanisms all games would be forbidden from selling loot boxes to children, etc.

203
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:05,278
Speaker 1: Etc.

204
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,126
Speaker 1: So we'll see where this all goes.

205
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:12,120
Speaker 1: but it has bipartisan support which is rare with this kind of law.

206
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:16,454
Speaker 1: Usually when there's bipartisan support for a law that's restrictive on media.

207
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,000
Speaker 1: Those laws tend to be shitty laws.

208
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:21,219
Speaker 1: So the only problem is that right now?

209
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,220
Speaker 1: Basically, no legislation can move anywhere in our government because of the president refusing to sign anything.

210
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,466
Speaker 0: I'm sure he will sign it.

211
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,919
Speaker 0: the protect children from gambling abuse.

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,608
Speaker 0: Even even this president will sign that.

213
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:41,300
Speaker 1: I don't think so because he basically just said that he won't sign anything Until the house stops investigating.

214
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:45,913
Speaker 0: Personally, why do you believe anything the lyingest liar in the history of lying ever said?

215
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:53,474
Speaker 1: because the one thing the lyingest liar doesn't lie about is Threatening people unless they stop investigating him for shit.

216
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:54,820
Speaker 0: That's actually not true.

217
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,139
Speaker 0: He threatens people all the time and then doesn't go through with it or or tries to sue people and fails all the time.

218
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,531
Speaker 1: But in this case, it's something he actually has control over.

219
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,160
Speaker 1: Usually the threats he makes are things he can't actually do.

220
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean he just cuz he can do it doesn't mean gonna do it.

221
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,807
Speaker 0: Listen, if the if somehow this actually gets to his decks, I think he would be like hey look at me I'm protecting kids from whatever.

222
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:16,690
Speaker 0: what okay?

223
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,272
Speaker 1: I don't know.

224
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:17,795
Speaker 1: I bet he wouldn't.

225
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:19,180
Speaker 1: I bet this bill goes nowhere.

226
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:20,547
Speaker 0: I mean, that's probably true.

227
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:21,029
Speaker 0: Also.

228
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of I don't think it'll even get to this.

229
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:34,520
Speaker 1: So, uh in some other last news This is just a tweet but I have a lot to say about it It's in the tree was someone saying oh, we're not dumbing down our culture at all.

230
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,640
Speaker 1: Basically someone got a picture of at Target.

231
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:42,740
Speaker 1: Target they're selling classic movies on DVD or blu-ray or whatever.

232
00:16:43,526 --> 00:17:03,413
Speaker 1: but Instead of putting the title of the movie on the top of the cover like every DVD has been for all of history They're putting the quote from the movie That basic people who don't know anything about cinema and have not seen these movies Would recognize even if they don't know what the movie is called.

233
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,339
Speaker 0: I don't understand what you're saying.

234
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,631
Speaker 1: So the move the box for Scarface.

235
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:18,800
Speaker 1: the top says say hello to my little friend Like that's the name of the movie and at the bottom in a much smaller font Scarface I mean someone who's still buying DVDs and blu-rays.

236
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,386
Speaker 0: That's the kind of person that that is probably a better sales dress that Jaws is titled.

237
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,980
Speaker 1: you're gonna need a bigger boat and then Jaws isn't a little text at the bottom.

238
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,940
Speaker 1: So it's interesting because I think it's a very smart marketing decision.

239
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,711
Speaker 0: It's good trade dress first, you know target audience.

240
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:39,880
Speaker 0: So it is buying movies at Best Buy right?

241
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,303
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they're not gonna buy Jaws, you know Can you like?

242
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:46,472
Speaker 0: how can you even sell a Jaws on DVD?

243
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,440
Speaker 0: that movie is just like so easily available?

244
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,136
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but I guess that's probably the only way to convince someone to buy.

245
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:54,119
Speaker 0: it is like, you know they see that and they're like.

246
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:59,714
Speaker 1: So I guess what I'm getting at is that people are really on TV all the time.

247
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:06,708
Speaker 0: Someone who's buying discs at Best Buy definitely has cable TV is probably watching it But it sort of gets back to like.

248
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,355
Speaker 1: how do people find and search for things?

249
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,868
Speaker 1: a lot of people Don't know a lot about things.

250
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,560
Speaker 1: using the someone's more likely to recognize.

251
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,840
Speaker 1: Say hello to my little friend then have any idea who Al Pacino is right?

252
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:28,968
Speaker 0: The other thing is that you know, it's somebody who John when was Jaws in theaters 1970 something Early 80s late 70s something like that, right?

253
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:33,540
Speaker 0: It's old so people don't know it, but that's what I'm saying.

254
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:35,009
Speaker 1: I'm not mad about this.

255
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,599
Speaker 1: I think it's a good idea.

256
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:41,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the best part is fuck is on the the label of a disc.

257
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:44,734
Speaker 0: I'm more mad that why are people still buying discs?

258
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,240
Speaker 0: eliminate all physical media?

259
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,711
Speaker 1: But the best part about this is all the replies to the tweets.

260
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:53,367
Speaker 1: not polluting the earth with your plastic because the replies to the Tweet are things like oh man.

261
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:55,379
Speaker 1: I can't wait to watch you son of a bitch.

262
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,409
Speaker 1: Or I'm gonna have me some fun.

263
00:18:58,831 --> 00:18:59,675
Speaker 0: Go have me some fun.

264

Speaker 1: Go have me some fun.

Speaker 0: Sorry goat.

Speaker 0: He's not a bad dude though, and what's interesting is he it's a video of his bike commute And he's narrating his bike commute.

282
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,583
Speaker 0: It's kind of a long one yeah So you know.

283
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:14,656
Speaker 0: anyway the thing is his bike commute is from his suburban ish home to his workplace Which is in a warehouse in a place that I'd never heard of Known as the Springfield underground.

284
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:24,168
Speaker 1: now I assume when Scott said that that it's like the Rochester subway like some abandoned subway that someone got access to I'd never heard Of the Springfield underground before.

285
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:31,693
Speaker 0: obviously neither is rim neither of most people But once you learn what the Springfield underground is it is fascinating and amazing.

286
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:34,360
Speaker 0: what around apparently way back in the day?

287
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,849
Speaker 0: There was a mine, and they were mining.

288
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,940
Speaker 0: I think he said limestone for fertilizer.

289
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,732
Speaker 1: So fun facts inside.

290
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:43,760
Speaker 1: you know what's under Detroit?

291
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,080
Speaker 1: What did I think the biggest salt mine in the world like the salt catacombs anyway?

292
00:20:48,780 --> 00:21:04,145
Speaker 0: So that mine is obviously no one's mining there anymore, but it was this vast Empty underground space where a lot of rock had been removed But it was pretty much flat with a ceiling you know and some pillars of rock because you can't remove them all then they will Collapse in on.

293
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:10,155
Speaker 0: yeah, right yeah, so some rock pillars You know sort of like you know the big empty warehouse.

294
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:10,938
Speaker 1: so it's got.

295
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:16,214
Speaker 1: here's a question Do you know what it's called when a stalag tight and a stalagmite meet a stag?

296
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,120
Speaker 1: there is a word for a stalag.

297
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,225
Speaker 1: I looked everything.

298
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,511
Speaker 1: I actually forgot it.

299
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,818
Speaker 1: I don't remember the word a stalag

300
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:38,589
Speaker 0: not Stalagma tight Magnetite I don't know anyway, so in the Springfield underground what they did is they said hey We got this big empty space here right in this big empty space it is a Always like 62 degrees no matter fucking what.

301
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,636
Speaker 0: no right it doesn't.

302
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:41,640
Speaker 1: that's how heat pumps work.

303
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:45,334
Speaker 0: I mean it doesn't get hot or cold ever it's always the same temperature.

304
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:46,940
Speaker 0: There's a lot of room.

305
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,091
Speaker 0: It's big and wide and open right.

306
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,980
Speaker 0: there must be some kind of ventilation going on.

307
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,026
Speaker 0: I don't know if he talked about that.

308
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:55,480
Speaker 1: I mean mines usually had some sort of ventilation strategy.

309
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,140
Speaker 0: No one's right.

310
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,483
Speaker 0: I saw there was a part where he looks and there's a big hole in the ceiling with like water coming in from and from Sunlight coming in.

311
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:02,506
Speaker 0: so you know.

312
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:03,870
Speaker 0: and what they did is it?

313
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:12,349
Speaker 0: well all we got to do is between some of these rock pillars we put up a few walls right and then the natural walls are behind there.

314
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:16,974
Speaker 0: and Boom you just got yourself a warehouse for like no effort.

315
00:22:17,014 --> 00:22:19,464
Speaker 0: You don't got to build ceiling You don't got to build a wall.

316
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:20,548
Speaker 0: You know you build one wall.

317
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,596
Speaker 0: Yeah boom enormous warehouse.

318
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:24,965
Speaker 0: It is a Ultra secure.

319
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:26,170
Speaker 0: no all right.

320
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,780
Speaker 0: It must be real hard to get in there and rob those warehouses.

321
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,850
Speaker 0: Right be ultra temperature and humidity control.

322
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:36,620
Speaker 0: you don't got to have H vac or heating or anything right?

323
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:45,400
Speaker 0: It's just good to go and You got tons of fucking room real cheap because who else wants to be underground and it's enormous.

324
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:53,950
Speaker 0: So he bikes to work in a warehouse and he bikes through this enormous Springfield underground And he shows you what's going on down there.

325
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,020
Speaker 0: They're building some more warehouses down there.

326
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,365
Speaker 0: They got all kinds of stuff.

327
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,553
Speaker 1: that stalagnates is where they meet.

328
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,300
Speaker 0: okay you Adam anyway.

329
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:03,526
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's really interesting.

330
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:09,940
Speaker 0: I think the only thing that was a it's like a waste of energy down There was that there's there's doing food storage.

331
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,886
Speaker 0: So they do have to have some refrigeration going on.

332
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:22,257
Speaker 0: well the refrigeration only has to get from 62 down as opposed to exactly Yeah, even in the hot hot 90 degree summer if you had your warehouse outside What would the bill be for that?

333
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:26,480
Speaker 0: They also have to light the whole thing you know, and I'm sure there must have added lights pretty.

334
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,289
Speaker 0: I'm curious about the plumbing situation.

335
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,520
Speaker 1: I mean there's probably a bathroom in there somewhere.

336
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:32,699
Speaker 0: I mean you wouldn't make it to the bathroom.

337
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,522
Speaker 0: It's too big.

338
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:36,632
Speaker 0: just if you had to go outside to poop you wouldn't make.

339
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:40,514
Speaker 0: I guess you could just put bring porta potties in and out at worst case you could.

340
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:45,995
Speaker 0: just You do need running water to wash your hands Yeah, but there's plenty of room for the parking lots.

341
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:47,442
Speaker 0: pulling her into bike You know.

342
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,636
Speaker 0: so pretty fascinating to see what's going on in the place.

343
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,962
Speaker 0: I didn't know existed Underground.

344
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:57,516
Speaker 1: so I got a question for you when the first spy satellites were put up in space?

345
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:02,848
Speaker 0: when was this like 60s 60s 70s yeah Even 80s?

346
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:09,018
Speaker 1: okay well yeah Earlier spy satellites, how do you think they got images back to earth?

347
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:09,600
Speaker 0: well?

348
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:11,820
Speaker 0: They didn't have the internet right yeah.

349
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,080
Speaker 0: So they definitely had a satellite dish on the ground aimed at the satellite with some sort of data going between.

350
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:20,151
Speaker 0: No much like satellite technology didn't really exist.

351
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:22,680
Speaker 1: yet for images there were satellite television.

352
00:24:23,143 --> 00:24:25,239
Speaker 0: Uh what what in the 80s?

353
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:31,639
Speaker 1: What would they use in a satellite to capture the image to then transmit back a?

354
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,319
Speaker 1: Camera with a big-ass fucking lens on what did know that was not feasible technology back then?

355
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:40,044
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

356
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,877
Speaker 1: Why not, but do you know how?

357
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:43,440
Speaker 1: early?

358
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,754
Speaker 1: Cameras worked for like TV.

359
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,091
Speaker 0: right, but you read Like a TV camera on a salad.

360
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,580
Speaker 1: There's no way to put that on a satellite.

361
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,192
Speaker 0: They couldn't put a TV camera from the other side of a satellite.

362
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:54,980
Speaker 1: No you also couldn't transmit that back.

363
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,519
Speaker 1: Satellites in that era fucking shot canisters of film back down to earth.

364
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,508
Speaker 0: Physical film they just there's film.

365
00:25:03,528 --> 00:25:04,751
Speaker 0: they took photos and they drop.

366
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:09,604
Speaker 1: TV cameras weren't even high enough resolution to get meaningful images Film and just stopped.

367
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:15,480
Speaker 1: yeah, that is literally how they worked and this video explains in detail you had to catch the film.

368
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,547
Speaker 0: Yes, what the Russians caught the film.

369
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:21,000
Speaker 0: so if they shot the film did they go around trying to catch Russian film?

370
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we didn't get the film down the film was designed.

371
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,960
Speaker 1: if we didn't pick it up within 48 hours it destroyed itself.

372
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:28,572
Speaker 0: What did we try to catch?

373
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:29,096
Speaker 0: Russian film?

374
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:29,137
Speaker 0: I?

375
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,632
Speaker 1: This video will tell you everything catching a Russian film.

376
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,460
Speaker 1: I don't think we ever caught any of their film.

377
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,408
Speaker 0: What kind of film was it actually?

378
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,577
Speaker 1: this tells you everything about even how the lenses worked.

379
00:25:38,878 --> 00:25:46,386
Speaker 1: the lenses Actually had to be really complicated for a bunch of reasons I don't want to get into of course because yeah This video is actually.

380
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:50,099
Speaker 0: they could zoom in way more than you think they could zoom in real far.

381
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,468
Speaker 1: Yep, how they calibrated the images.

382
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:56,000
Speaker 1: this video in ten minutes will tell you some fascinating shit.

383
00:25:57,342 --> 00:26:00,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, they couldn't just throw there a bunch of empty satellites up there.

384
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:03,836
Speaker 1: They've had satellites for d orbited as far as I can tell.

385
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,145
Speaker 0: otherwise I say hey Let's go up and get one.

386
00:26:05,427 --> 00:26:06,012
Speaker 1: This is a good bit.

387
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,040
Speaker 0: You got a real good lens on it.

388
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,933
Speaker 0: We can take photos man.

389
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,692
Speaker 0: Yeah That lens is still good even that the film is done.

390
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:20,435
Speaker 1: the lens had a Sweeping mechanism to make the lens take a picture of one part of the ground because the satellites going by at a crazy speed It'll be blurry otherwise yep.

391
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:27,100
Speaker 1: So yeah in the moment the geek nice book club book as we talked about in the beginning is a book by Troy deading.

392
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:37,820
Speaker 1: That is a Dungeons & Dragons Branded Planescape book from the early days of the Planescape setting officially licensed D&D novel that the first half of it is a straight.

393
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,283
Speaker 1: Well the first third of it is a straightforward D&D book just like all that elf crap I used to read.

394
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,860
Speaker 1: and the rest of it is a trippy nightmare descent into hell.

395
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,586
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good way to describe it.

396
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:52,480
Speaker 1: surreal nonsense happens at the end, and we're reading it.

397
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,608
Speaker 1: We'll probably done with it by the next Thursday's show.

398
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:55,551
Speaker 0: We'll see.

399
00:26:55,832 --> 00:26:57,599
Speaker 1: I doubt it's gonna be sunny every day.

400
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:58,584
Speaker 0: We'll see.

401
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:01,095
Speaker 1: hey you got a flight to Rochester you finish it on that flight.

402
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:01,980
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

403
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, we might both finish it on that flight.

404
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:04,734
Speaker 1: If nothing else.

405
00:27:04,815 --> 00:27:07,648
Speaker 0: That's on the 4th of July though Yeah, so worst case in August.

406
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,239
Speaker 1: We will do this show okay probably before then.

407
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:21,220
Speaker 0: the next invention we're going to is PAX West which is a long time from now, but I Mention it because a badges will be on sale soon after Memorial Day, but not before Memorial Day.

408
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,714
Speaker 0: So this weekend you can just relax and then after that you got to be at a highest alert.

409
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:36,214
Speaker 1: Yeah starting Tuesday Morning Eastern Daylight Time it is red alert and by Thursday It is like black alert like Def Con one.

410
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,700
Speaker 1: the nukes were launched also.

411
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,593
Speaker 0: They are doing something that they are undoing a previous policy.

412
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:42,857
Speaker 1: the panel submissions are open to.

413
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:43,660
Speaker 1: I gotta get in that shit.

414
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,200
Speaker 0: They are going to once again be selling full weekend passes.

415
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:51,100
Speaker 0: So I'm sure they won't be any cheaper than four individual one-day passes.

416
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:52,285
Speaker 0: But they will see.

417
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:55,840
Speaker 0: you only have to carry one piece of plastic around with you for all four days.

418
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:59,489
Speaker 0: My I think you know we we were talking about.

419
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:02,700
Speaker 0: hey selling the individual passes changes the culture of packs.

420
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,019
Speaker 0: But I think what this won't do any have that effect.

421
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,049
Speaker 1: I think it's because same effect they're basically.

422
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:24,640
Speaker 0: they think they're looking at their numbers and saying well This many people bought one of each day, so we'll just sell that many weekend passes Maybe a little less than that yeah, and then we'll just basically make the same amount of money sell the same badges But a certain number of people won't have to carry around all this extra plastic with them.

423
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I don't know exactly what if I were doing it.

424
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:35,158
Speaker 1: I would just say if someone by if someone can legitimately get all four days in their order They will just get a single four-day badge instead.

425
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,748
Speaker 0: well What if they want it?

426
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:49,343
Speaker 0: you know I guess they could be a checkbox saying yes Please send me four separate ones because maybe you buy one of each day And it's like two or for your friend on Friday Saturday, and yeah two or for you on whatever Sunday Monday I don't know,

427
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:50,890
Speaker 1: but at the other counter point

428
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,577
Speaker 0: was that somebody would buy all the days But not actually want a single person to go.

429
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:58,389
Speaker 1: all true But the counterpoint would be many of the people.

430
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,678
Speaker 1: is some of the people doing the vast majority scalp?

431
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,040
Speaker 0: yes But the vast majority who are buying all four days want to go all have a person who's going off?

432
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,820
Speaker 1: Yes, and before anyone tries to talk again about like scalpers ruining this scalpers are not the problem.

433
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:15,653
Speaker 1: Pax is just not cannot be physically big enough to give everyone wants it a badge.

434
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:20,419
Speaker 0: scalpers are a symptom of any time that demand exceeds supply.

435
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,616
Speaker 0: Someone will come in and arbitrage to make money.

436
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,987
Speaker 0: yep And the scalpers aren't the cause of the problem.

437
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:36,980
Speaker 1: the problem is there's not enough and Pax has decided very pointedly for good or ill That they'd rather it be random who gets in based partly on who's paying the most attention.

438
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:43,680
Speaker 0: Then let it just be Pax badges $500 or you know have tiers of pricing or anything like that.

439
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm glad they have not done.

440
00:29:44,845 --> 00:29:55,368
Speaker 0: because yes scalpers are a problem for things where demand It doesn't actually meet supply or comes close to meeting supply or this would sell out But it'll take a month for it to sell out naturally.

441
00:29:55,749 --> 00:30:03,500
Speaker 0: so scalpers come in and eat up the extra supply And then jack up the price usually with the cooperation of companies like Ticketmaster.

442
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, but once those cases you can blame scalpers.

443
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:11,898
Speaker 1: But once the demand is known and the demand is already above the capacity scalpers have no impact.

444
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,660
Speaker 1: yes Also, I noticed scalpers have a hard time actually selling their badges these days.

445
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,620
Speaker 0: They stand outside of packs like go buy and selling guys.

446
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,488
Speaker 1: I think as most people I just sell badges.

447
00:30:22,668 --> 00:30:36,973
Speaker 1: I think it's because anyone who doesn't live in Seattle and Doesn't get badges when they first go on sale does not have a hotel because the hotel sell out, too They're not gonna fly to Seattle and risk not getting badges.

448
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,037
Speaker 0: I'm gonna scalp a hotel.

449
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:44,959
Speaker 0: Yeah There's no scalping But you could basically you can scalp by selling your badges to someone who lives there and does not have a thing.

450
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:53,414
Speaker 1: yep But Seattle is a tiny little baby city that doesn't have that many people in it yet And especially not on the weekend when you know there's no one as at work.

451
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,527
Speaker 1: Yep, so uh Anyway, let's get to the main bit.

452
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:03,525
Speaker 1: There was a movie that came out in and We're sort of gonna review it.

453
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,939
Speaker 1: I guess we're gonna spoil shit cuz I assume you've seen this movie.

454
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:20,676
Speaker 1: It's gonna talk about the matrix because the thing that stands out in my mind to this day Is that this is probably the first movie I ever saw and I have tried and succeeded to have this experience for a lot of movies in my adult life, and I love it.

455
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:26,573
Speaker 1: when this happens like When I went to see us I didn't know anything about it except.

456
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,140
Speaker 1: I saw did not even the teaser trailer.

457
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,749
Speaker 1: I just saw the image the movie poster.

458
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:37,146
Speaker 1: when I went to see the matrix all I knew about it was It's about some hacker guy.

459
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:42,598
Speaker 0: well the the marketing campaign for the matrix which I remember because I was alive And was the target audience yep?

460
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,844
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I was.

461
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,334
Speaker 1: we were wondering like you want to look at the demographic.

462
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:48,660
Speaker 1: They were trying to get to see the matrix.

463
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:49,555
Speaker 1: It's me and Scott.

464
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:55,558
Speaker 0: anyway It was a very very good marketing campaign where you know back in the day where I still saw ads.

465
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:56,320
Speaker 0: yep, right?

466
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,462
Speaker 1: What is the matrix?

467
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:02,679
Speaker 0: put all these signs around and all the posters and images were this black sheet with green?

468
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,947
Speaker 0: Hacker hacker text falling down.

469
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,955
Speaker 0: even had that as desktop wallpaper at some point.

470
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:07,196
Speaker 0: Yep.

471
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:09,924
Speaker 0: I had that as a Screensaver.

472
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:12,138
Speaker 0: screensaver - yeah, yeah, I had that screensaver.

473
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:17,920
Speaker 0: anyway It was black screen with green stuff trickling down green characters trickling down a very hacker aesthetic.

474
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,687
Speaker 0: And they were all like what is the matrix?

475
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:25,560
Speaker 0: question mark Gabbo Gabbo Gabbo, and they didn't tell you fucking shit.

476
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:25,941
Speaker 0: There was.

477
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:27,948
Speaker 0: no there might have been a trailer.

478
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:28,710
Speaker 0: I never saw it.

479
00:32:29,553 --> 00:32:31,640
Speaker 1: I was on the hype train from day one.

480
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:38,480
Speaker 0: I was a website I went to in the end on my Netscape navigator browser that didn't have much information at all whatsoever.

481
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,068
Speaker 1: So I was like I'm gonna see this movie.

482
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:42,012
Speaker 1: I went opening night.

483
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:43,840
Speaker 0: I was like yeah, what is the fucking matrix?

484
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:44,819
Speaker 0: Let's go find out.

485
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,491
Speaker 0: It's definitely appealing to my aesthetic.

486
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:52,401
Speaker 1: me and Ken and like my whole high school crew we just went to see the matrix and The.

487
00:32:52,442 --> 00:32:54,407
Speaker 1: we watched the movie and we were like alright.

488
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:54,829
Speaker 1: This is cool.

489
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:55,230
Speaker 1: This is cool.

490
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:01,615
Speaker 1: This is cool, and then when he wakes up Outside of the matrix I know I went to the theater.

491
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:02,500
Speaker 1: when what?

492
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:11,299
Speaker 1: I figured out before then oh yeah, but but there was a physical palpable loud reaction in the theater.

493
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:21,860
Speaker 1: Remember, I remember that moment when he when he like pulls the thing out of his throat and like looks around The theater was like wow there was like a lot of rumbling in the audience.

494
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:28,080
Speaker 1: Right and I saw the matrix like four more times in the theater.

495
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:41,033
Speaker 0: Yep, and I still remember I dis interesting neither one of us actually remembered the order of all the scenes Especially in the early part, but I remembered every scene.

496
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:44,685
Speaker 1: I remember every scene Mostly right.

497
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:50,649
Speaker 1: I remember this movie in like a weird degree of detail Mmm, and I still love it.

498
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, this movie makes the very short list of movies.

499
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,620
Speaker 1: Can I have a list we always try to maintain of what is a movie where if you're?

500
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,879
Speaker 1: Reminded that it exists you immediately feel an urge to just watch it.

501
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:04,580
Speaker 0: If it is on you'll just watch it.

502
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:12,697
Speaker 0: You're just gonna be trained Snared by it like a bear trap where you have to sit there until it's over like when I was Rewind it and watch it again when I was home yesterday.

503
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,165
Speaker 1: I go out to right now.

504
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:21,065
Speaker 1: when I was at home over the summer like after a freshman year of our IT The matrix was just on TV Half the time.

505
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,280
Speaker 1: I just like stop changing the channels and just watch it at least until the next commercial break.

506
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:25,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

507
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:26,404
Speaker 1: Oh matrix.

508
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:26,864
Speaker 1: Yeah.

509
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:27,828
Speaker 1: Yeah matrix.

510
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:35,530
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They're like maybe 12 movies that exist on earth that are on that list for me And somehow the matrix is one of them.

511
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,266
Speaker 0: so words about the movie itself I just want to talk about.

512
00:34:38,288 --> 00:34:39,719
Speaker 0: like the more meta stuff.

513
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the other meta thing besides the marketing campaign is that this is a movie that?

514
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:53,139
Speaker 0: Introduced a lot of existing cinematographic techniques and styles to the u.s.

515
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,135
Speaker 0: Western audience right specifically Hong Kong action cinema who shot kung fu stuff right.

516
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:02,685
Speaker 0: so I've seen many kung fu movies Right, but I hadn't seen that.

517
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:03,086
Speaker 0: you know.

518
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,613
Speaker 0: this is different styles of kung fu movie right.

519
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:14,284
Speaker 0: there's the style where people are doing like realistic Kung fu right and then there's a style where people are like jumping 20 feet in the air like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

520
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:29,219
Speaker 0: and the matrix was like the first Western movie to at least to the mass You know Hollywood Audience make that kind of action scene like the core of its aesthetic right where it's like.

521
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:38,055
Speaker 0: yeah They're not just fighting like you know they do in Terminator 2 or Rambo And a Van Damme like kickboxer movie right?

522
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:39,340
Speaker 0: or karate kid.

523
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:42,090
Speaker 0: You know it was like her bloodsport.

524
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,217
Speaker 0: It was like sure but exactly right.

525
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:44,960
Speaker 0: it wasn't like that.

526
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,837
Speaker 0: It was superhero fighting superhero kung fu and before the matrix there wasn't a movie that did that.

527
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:54,179
Speaker 0: and after the matrix There are many Western movies that have done this yep.

528
00:35:54,621 --> 00:35:56,265
Speaker 1: And it also introduced like.

529
00:35:56,807 --> 00:36:07,180
Speaker 1: it is hard to understate how many people who had never encountered like babies first solipsism babies first philosophy shadows in a cave.

530
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:12,379
Speaker 1: Every fucking edgelord kid thought they were a philosopher after they saw this movie.

531
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:12,540
Speaker 0: right.

532
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,363
Speaker 0: well Basically what the matrix does is it combines all these basic things into a never-before-made Combination right.

533
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:35,779
Speaker 0: so you're combining a the what if we're all living in a simulation thing which has another side Which is an idea that I had come across prior to seeing the matrix yep So in the same year another movie called the 13th floor came out.

534
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:37,951
Speaker 0: That was about a bunch of.

535
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,440
Speaker 0: I have not seen that but I heard of it.

536
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,330
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm not even gonna say anything else.

537
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:42,597
Speaker 0: It's better than the matrix.

538
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:48,174
Speaker 1: Yes The 13th floor it's not a watch it a million times movie, so it's not better than the main.

539
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:51,884
Speaker 1: well because the matrix is Better at being a movie.

540
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:56,560
Speaker 1: I just never want to not watch because of all the Hong Kong cinema kung fu action.

541
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:02,600
Speaker 1: But the 13th floor is a smarter movie that makes a much more complex and nuanced point.

542
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:06,980
Speaker 1: Like the 13th floor is a really really really good movie, and you should see it.

543
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:08,166
Speaker 1: I would watch it again.

544
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:14,176
Speaker 1: the matrix also had like the blue pill red pill action Yeah, which has been co-opted by the worst people on earth.

545
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:22,057
Speaker 1: Yeah But when it can I remember like before like incel shitlords made red pill a thing right.

546
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:26,488
Speaker 1: blue pill red pill was a Thing for edgelords around being edgy and cool.

547
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:28,373
Speaker 0: and also what the matrix.

548
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:37,452
Speaker 0: while it has a white Hero problem yeah white dude hero problem and also has a white Savior problem I think it's the right term.

549
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:37,919
Speaker 0: right yeah.

550
00:37:38,561 --> 00:37:43,674
Speaker 0: And also has the yes the white hero Savior has to definitely kiss.

551
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,882
Speaker 0: the lady right has those two Problems.

552
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:48,888
Speaker 1: yeah, why did I have to be a love interest?

553
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:52,679
Speaker 0: it also has plenty of kick-ass ladies and colored people in it.

554
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,014
Speaker 0: yep Sort of has the negatives and the positives.

555
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,219
Speaker 0: It's on that border between right.

556
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:07,900
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah The other thing is that the matrix combines the not also not something you know it's an aesthetic that I was familiar with.

557
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,219
Speaker 0: But the pot the mass uh you know Western audience was not the cyberpunk snow crash aesthetic.

558
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:15,689
Speaker 1: yep I was part of why I love it so much.

559
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:27,601
Speaker 1: is that I love that aesthetic and the only place I really got to see that aesthetic pre matrix was Blade Runner Shadowrun Shadowrun and a bunch of a Spider-Man 2099.

560
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:35,909
Speaker 1: That's part of why I was so into anime because there was a lot of stuff like that in the kind of anime I was watching right before I got to our IT.

561
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:45,679
Speaker 0: funny that they actually made matrix anime officially after the mate right yep Which if you haven't seen the only other canon matrix material yeah, and it's pretty good like you should see it.

562
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:50,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, the anime the anime tricks and the matrix of the only canon matrix material.

563
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:51,397
Speaker 1: It's really a shame.

564
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:56,040
Speaker 0: the Wachowski sisters Someone tried to make an MMO once but that didn't turn out too.

565
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,793
Speaker 1: Well, I heard that someone tried to make a sequel to the matrix.

566
00:38:58,894 --> 00:38:59,738
Speaker 0: that didn't come out though.

567
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:05,192
Speaker 1: I know shame the point is I've never seen the matrix reloaded.

568
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,000
Speaker 0: okay never on Netflix.

569
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,860
Speaker 1: Oh Scott was convinced for like a decade that I'd seen it and even argued with me that I may actually watch him.

570
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:17,420
Speaker 0: I may watch those non-canon materials just to remember them after because they're on Netflix.

571
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,660
Speaker 1: But Scott you seriously tried to argue with me that I saw the matrix reloaded with you in the theater.

572
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:28,249
Speaker 0: Not only did I know it's been well established my memory is not great except apparently passwords.

573
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:34,790
Speaker 1: Yeah But I did go to see matrix revolutions in the theater, and I did not need to have seen matrix really don't?

574
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:47,621
Speaker 0: The point is matrix also combined that cyberpunk aesthetic right with right with the wuxia kung fu aesthetic Yeah, and the HR Geiger aesthetic yeah Never.

575
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:48,825
Speaker 0: it is like this.

576
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:53,518
Speaker 0: you know know what other thing combines all the good ins into one bucket?

577
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:54,260
Speaker 1: like to get that.

578
00:39:54,381 --> 00:40:01,397
Speaker 1: I'd have to just watch Blade Runner and Pretend that they're in the same universe like your turn to the 36 chamber.

579
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:14,179
Speaker 1: We actually have the flying people But it's really honestly Blade Runner and alien would really make sense to be in the same universe sure like Considering the plot of both of them and the themes they both address and I'd have to watch both of those.

580
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:15,965
Speaker 1: Then watch I don't know.

581
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:20,882
Speaker 0: I think it more makes more sense for alien to just come way after 2001 in 2010.

582
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that could work anyway anyway.

583
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,118
Speaker 1: So I love the shit out of the matrix, and I feel like I'm gonna watch it again like you just did.

584
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:30,117
Speaker 0: yeah Why not yeah?

585
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,022
Speaker 1: It was just great.

586
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:31,524
Speaker 0: I watched it.

587
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:32,246
Speaker 0: It was so fucking great.

588
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:34,836
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what's great about the matrix?

589
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:42,523
Speaker 0: so first of all right The all those action scenes I just talked about with all the kung fu and all that biz right there super well choreographed Right.

590
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:44,270
Speaker 1: they're not a bunch of fast cuts.

591
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,720
Speaker 1: They're long cuts like I like in kung fu movies.

592
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,027
Speaker 1: They're not that long But they're longer than the average American action movie.

593
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,772
Speaker 1: up to that point a at for the.

594
00:40:52,153 --> 00:41:07,578
Speaker 0: whether they invented or popularized it They were the first to deploy the technique of having a ton of cameras in an arc around the scene bullet time and then Panning from one camera to the next and they use this right in the opening scene.

595
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:10,268
Speaker 0: right Trinity jumps up in the air right.

596
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:13,300
Speaker 0: you're looking at her straight on and then the camera.

597
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,503
Speaker 0: It looks like the cat.

598
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:28,620
Speaker 0: everything is frozen and the camera is moving while time is stopped to then come to the side Profile, but in the way They did this was just a bunch of cameras right all lined up and then use some computers to get the in-between bits right.

599
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,840
Speaker 0: So before that that was not a technique that was used often.

600
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:35,577
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe even invented it or were the first to use it.

601
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,726
Speaker 0: in Hollywood There is a whole.

602
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,420
Speaker 0: now it is used all the fucking time.

603
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:42,979
Speaker 1: There's a whole Wikipedia article just on bullet time as a concept.

604
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:48,777
Speaker 1: yep Cuz bullet time is a registered trademark of Warner Brothers who made this movie.

605
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,500
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure right.

606
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,949
Speaker 0: Another thing it goes on in the matrix.

607
00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:00,880
Speaker 1: Oh get this they trademarked it in 2005 Mm-hmm as used in the matrix online.

608
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:04,825
Speaker 1: Ah So they didn't trademark.

609
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:06,530
Speaker 1: there were the phrase bullet time.

610
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,580
Speaker 0: until then you even saw video games employing bullet time.

611
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,740
Speaker 0: They would have like video after the majors came out.

612
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:22,155
Speaker 0: there were a lot of FPS is and third-person games where you would push your button and like the game would slow down for a Short amount of time to allow you to like you know aim or follow three.

613
00:42:22,175 --> 00:42:23,179
Speaker 0: does it too right where it's like?

614
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,599
Speaker 0: right anyway What was I saying?

615
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,404
Speaker 1: Something about bullet time.

616
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:34,739
Speaker 0: oh another thing the matrix did is that I don't know it definitely probably wasn't the first.

617
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:37,959
Speaker 0: Cuz remember Toy Story wasn't that much older than the matrix.

618
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:51,544
Speaker 0: To have CG stuff like that was obviously CG stuff and people together in the same scenes And having a watched it yesterday That's probably the.

619
00:42:52,046 --> 00:42:58,328
Speaker 0: it holds up enough like it's that some of the CG stuff holds on But is like borderline not holding on.

620
00:42:58,348 --> 00:42:59,050
Speaker 0: it's like it's like the.

621
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:02,020
Speaker 0: it's just over the line of still being okay.

622
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:05,814
Speaker 0: Some of it like the robot the sentry robots that are like cutting open the ship.

623
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,919
Speaker 1: yeah, they don't look that great They don't look the greatest.

624
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:13,151
Speaker 0: There are some other things that could be that like.

625
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:19,679
Speaker 0: but the scene for example where like he touches the mirror And it's getting all over him that still holds up mostly just fine.

626
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:25,560
Speaker 1: well Cuz I can remember Terminator 2. that effect was pretty easy to do compared to like more complex stuff.

627
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:31,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Terminator 2 it was one object like inserted into the scene whereas.

628
00:43:31,154 --> 00:43:31,595
Speaker 0: This is like.

629
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:41,046
Speaker 1: It's covering his body and yeah looks like you watch old TV shows with early compositing and every time they show like a Monitor or display of any kind.

630
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:45,540
Speaker 1: the camera always has to be at a fixed angle because they couldn't do real-time tracking yet.

631
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:47,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah stuff like that.

632
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:51,439
Speaker 0: And the other thing is it the matrix the way they combine?

633
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:56,435
Speaker 0: Right there have been lots of movies that had lots of guns in them before the matrix.

634
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:57,699
Speaker 0: right fucking commando.

635
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, plenty.

636
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:04,951
Speaker 0: There's no shortage of big total recall has a lot of oh, yeah No short digga digga digga digga digga digga digga digga guns.

637
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:05,614
Speaker 0: No shortage.

638
00:44:05,674 --> 00:44:06,980
Speaker 0: I'll have you some fun, right?

639
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,442
Speaker 0: There is no.

640
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:15,571
Speaker 0: yeah, there's no shortage of those movies in existence, but for some reason the matrix Something about the audio design and also.

641
00:44:15,591 --> 00:44:18,240
Speaker 0: I don't know I can't put my finger on exactly what they did.

642
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,825
Speaker 1: You know what it's like.

643
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:24,836
Speaker 1: it's like how when you played counter-strike That was the first time I shot a gun in a game and whoa it felt like a gun right.

644
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:34,498
Speaker 0: there's something about the way they did the sound design on the sounds of the bullets the sounds of the bullets hitting things the music they played during the scenes if any right.

645
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:38,989
Speaker 0: the Visual impact of bullets on things right.

646
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,580
Speaker 0: and it's most notably in the scene where you know they come into the building.

647
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:45,147
Speaker 0: Right he goes through security.

648
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,312
Speaker 0: He's got a bunch of guns.

649
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:56,136
Speaker 0: then they start playing that propeller heads track Shoot up everyone in the lobby right and then the scene Shortly after that where they're in the helicopter.

650
00:44:56,156 --> 00:45:00,298
Speaker 0: He's got the minigun and the Right and he shoots up.

651
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:02,189
Speaker 0: basically I don't know how he doesn't hit Morpheus in that scene.

652
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,603
Speaker 1: that makes no sense cuz he's really good at what he's doing I guess.

653
00:45:04,623 --> 00:45:08,500
Speaker 0: yeah sure I just I. he lights up that room with the minigun.

654
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:14,840
Speaker 0: I have always liked the aesthetic and it's just someone how they have the slow motion and the minigun bullets are hitting the water.

655
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:17,140
Speaker 0: The sprinkler system went off after they hit the bomb.

656
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:22,395
Speaker 1: I have always liked someone wielding a minigun in a movie no matter what right in any context.

657
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:29,211
Speaker 1: Terminator 2 with the minigun That worked for its time, but this was the best minigun I'd ever seen.

658
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:29,472
Speaker 0: it was.

659
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:34,866
Speaker 0: it's just so much more impactful and Powerful.

660
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:35,835
Speaker 1: I just want to make a video now.

661
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:42,679
Speaker 0: that is like the American cinema in any other movie right and then the helicopter crashes into the side of the building.

662
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,417
Speaker 0: yeah All right, it's a little die-hard esque at that point because they're all up on the rooftops and shit.

663
00:45:47,658 --> 00:45:57,112
Speaker 1: yep This movie just it scratched a lot of varied itches all in the same film And it is very rare to have a movie that does that.

664
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:58,598
Speaker 1: that is that is done.

665
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:07,726
Speaker 0: well They're also just so many things in the movie that are now become like just part of vernacular like Woman in the red dress.

666
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:10,419
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like there's a netrunner card called woman in the red dress.

667
00:46:10,982 --> 00:46:13,090
Speaker 0: Right it's like people say that it has a meaning.

668
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:17,362
Speaker 0: right what other things You know?

669
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:20,733
Speaker 0: they're always talking on the telephone right which is for all.

670
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:25,833
Speaker 0: the telephone the cell phone that they had in that movie For you the Nokia phone where you everyone wanted that phone.

671
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:26,436
Speaker 1: you couldn't.

672
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:27,320
Speaker 1: phones weren't coming.

673
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:34,631
Speaker 0: They never sold that phone in the US as far as I'm aware where you push the button on the side and it goes Right as opposed to a flip phone where you open it.

674
00:46:35,455 --> 00:46:35,876
Speaker 0: I couldn't get.

675
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:36,660
Speaker 0: I wanted that phone.

676
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,302
Speaker 0: I couldn't get it.

677
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:42,078
Speaker 1: yeah remember in when this movie came out the vast majority of people did not have a cell phone.

678
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,160
Speaker 0: cell phones Were so it was a high-tech deal.

679
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:50,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we didn't have cell phones until like two years after the matrix came out, but it was very fascinating.

680
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:50,920
Speaker 0: how?

681
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:56,260
Speaker 0: They're like discs like physical discs were still a thing in this movie.

682
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, right because they it was to 1999. but telephones right.

683
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:02,579
Speaker 0: hackers like telephones hacking or like.

684
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,335
Speaker 0: you know That's the whole thing right.

685
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:14,660
Speaker 1: you know This is not that long after the era where phone freaking worked like I Legit used a red box to make free long-distance calls from Cedar Point when I was in middle school.

686
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,000
Speaker 0: So it's like your brain is in some simulation while your body is in the real world.

687
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,500
Speaker 0: But you need to find a simulated phone a telephone a simulator of a telephone in the simulation.

688
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:39,023
Speaker 0: You can use that to talk to people who are not in the simulation and communicate with the real world Via this digital telephone program Right.

689
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:50,560
Speaker 0: and then you can also use it to transport your brain out of the simulation to the real world Via a fake telephone, which is just a program I guess right.

690
00:47:51,563 --> 00:48:02,040
Speaker 0: and meanwhile the agents Right the bad guys are AI programs That have run amok and have no existence in the physical meat space.

691
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:08,020
Speaker 0: There are just programs in the simulation like AI bad guys that just actually have real intelligence.

692
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:13,839
Speaker 1: And agent Smith like Hugo Weaving is that character that is an iconic character for all time?

693
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,149
Speaker 0: well I mean look at these actors right.

694
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:19,534
Speaker 1: so Keanu Reeves already had a career And now Keanu Reeves like John wick is like.

695
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:23,092
Speaker 1: John wick is Probably like the matrix in terms of.

696
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,700
Speaker 1: I will watch it over and over and over again.

697
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,280
Speaker 0: I mean we saw the trailer for I'd haven't seen any John wicks But I saw the trailer for the one that was a new one when we went to see us, right?

698
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, right the one with the horse, and it basically just looked like the matrix.

699
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:37,384
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the Just matrix.

700
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:39,070
Speaker 1: no because instead of simulation.

701
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:48,640
Speaker 1: It's more like magical realism like what if there are Assassin wizards who made a deal with the devil, but the devil is just this dude who runs a hotel for assassins?

702
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,489
Speaker 1: It's hard to explain.

703
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,100
Speaker 0: It is the matrix aesthetic though, right?

704
00:48:53,341 --> 00:48:54,585
Speaker 0: Hotel and whatever?

705
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:55,728
Speaker 1: yeah, but it's a different.

706
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:56,791
Speaker 1: It's not cyberpunk.

707
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,276
Speaker 1: It's a different as you'll see.

708
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:00,282
Speaker 1: you'll see you'll see these movies You'll see what I mean.

709
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:00,744
Speaker 1: anyway.

710
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:05,740
Speaker 0: in addition right in addition to the simulation philosophy the AI gone wrong.

711
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:06,924
Speaker 0: You know thing.

712
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:08,047
Speaker 1: yeah is also.

713
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:09,632
Speaker 0: You know you know humans.

714
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:15,915
Speaker 1: You know being farmed for their energy Environmental thing, but it makes it does the same thing terminator 2 did.

715
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:17,020
Speaker 1: it definitely makes it clear.

716
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,633
Speaker 1: Humans kind of fucked up in the AI fought back in self-defense and here.

717
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:21,336
Speaker 1: We are mm-hmm.

718
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:27,557
Speaker 1: Anyway anyway if you haven't seen the matrix how hasn't seen the matrix?

719
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:28,320
Speaker 1: I imagine?

720
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,519
Speaker 0: there I'm just gonna tell everyone you've all seen the matrix go see it again because why not I?

721
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:43,177
Speaker 1: Imagine there are younger people listening to geek nights or out there who have not seen the matrix and might be turned off by The fact that the people who talk about the day told the most the movie is older than they are.

722
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:47,886
Speaker 0: it is a 20 year old movie and 20 has not seen that has.

723
00:49:48,046 --> 00:49:58,400
Speaker 1: tend to be the shitty edgelords who are now our age But are still shitty edgelords or people who are talking about it to bring up red pill and pull you into the in cello sphere.

724
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:01,713
Speaker 1: So you like those kinds of people will reference it.

725
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:02,758
Speaker 1: people will probably.

726
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:07,580
Speaker 0: what's funny Is that the the the edgelords in the real world are like yeah?

727
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,679
Speaker 0: You got to take you know the red pill to see what's really going on.

728
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:16,358
Speaker 0: But meanwhile the edgelord in the movie - wanted to take the blue pill and now know what's going on.

729
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:18,349
Speaker 0: Yeah Movie was right.

730
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:19,998
Speaker 0: edgelords don't want to know the truth.

731
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:25,805
Speaker 0: Edgelords are all about believing in lies and having blissful ignorance bad and traitorous.

732
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:35,523
Speaker 1: so if you for whatever reason have not seen the matrix as Long as you're okay with a lot of guns being used in a really awesome Cinematic way.

733
00:50:35,543 --> 00:50:38,072
Speaker 0: it's weird for how many guns you use how little like blood there is.

734
00:50:38,152 --> 00:50:40,883
Speaker 0: it's literally just bullets and people falling over When they get hit.

735
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:43,900
Speaker 1: yep, John wicks very similar except for a very few spits.

736
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:45,740
Speaker 0: No, there's not a lot of guts and blood or anything.

737
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:54,351
Speaker 1: Yeah Well actually John wick in the matrix of something else there will be a whole bunch of goons that die That don't matter that much, and there's no blood.

738
00:50:54,673 --> 00:50:58,687
Speaker 1: and then there's like the boss fights John wick and the matrix both do that.

739
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:06,350
Speaker 1: John wick will murder like a thousand Russians And then he'll have a long Snipe one person from far away.

740
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:06,792
Speaker 0: They don't even know.

741
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:08,521
Speaker 0: you're there like go go 13.

742
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:13,600
Speaker 1: Uh yeah normally, but John wick is not being an assassin for normal reasons.

743
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:16,610
Speaker 1: He is doing it because it's personal for revenge.

744
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:18,056
Speaker 0: You could still do it.

745
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:18,718
Speaker 0: go go 13 style.

746
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,967
Speaker 0: It's a little safer a little more effective.

747
00:51:21,088 --> 00:51:21,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, he won.

748
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:28,492
Speaker 1: He would but the person he's trying to kill is Behind a whole bunch of goons like three mini bosses.

749
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,220
Speaker 0: What would go would go go 13 kill all the goods and mini bosses?

750
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:31,924
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

751
00:51:32,528 --> 00:51:34,540
Speaker 1: uh you gotta get in the John wick universe.

752
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:35,663
Speaker 1: It's more like an RPG.

753
00:51:35,703 --> 00:51:38,450
Speaker 1: you gotta get through all these layers John wick.

754
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:45,588
Speaker 1: in fact the first movie has goons like random encounters goons Mini bosses boss square boss.

755
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,374
Speaker 1: there is a straight-up square boss.

756
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:48,096
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

757
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:49,380
Speaker 0: Oh, oh there is no spoon.

758
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,386
Speaker 0: That's another matrix thing.

759
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:57,076
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, people will say there there are people I am confident who quote there is no spoon and have no idea.

760
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:58,020
Speaker 1: that is from the matrix.

761
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:11,027
Speaker 1: Nope, just like people will quote the Simpsons badges we don't need no stinking badges having no idea that that is referencing either treasure of the Sierra Madre or God in saddles.

762
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:23,006
Speaker 1: no no I was gonna go further back and Saddles which references treasure the Sierra Madre yes, but no I was gonna reference a movie about the Girl Scouts that I forget what it's called Girl Scouts.

763
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,663
Speaker 1: we don't need no Stinking badges.

764
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:29,387
Speaker 1: the fuck was that movie called.

765
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:33,202
Speaker 1: it is called True.

766
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:34,507
Speaker 0: Beverly Hills never heard it.

767
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,053
Speaker 0: Oh, I've heard I've heard the name of that.

768
00:52:36,094 --> 00:52:37,660
Speaker 1: do not watch that movie.

769
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:47,274
Speaker 1: But if you want to piss certain kinds of people off if someone ever quotes treasure of the Sierra Madre Say to them with a straight face.

770
00:52:47,695 --> 00:52:50,000
Speaker 1: Haha true, Beverly Hills and see how they react.

771
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:56,180
Speaker 0: Also if you haven't seen treasure of the Sierra Madre you should see that that is some fucking good movie.

772
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:59,640
Speaker 0: Yep, and if you haven't seen Blazing Saddles it that is also a fucking good movie.

773
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,175
Speaker 1: Yep, it holds up better than a lot of those movies, but it's got flaws.

774
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,400
Speaker 1: It's a product of its time.

775
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:10,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is better than other movies that are a product of that time, but it is still.

776
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,100
Speaker 1: it's not great.

777
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:13,458
Speaker 1: It's it's okay.

778
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:15,889
Speaker 1: Well, it's not like for example.

779
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,960
Speaker 1: I don't need to space balls ain't funny.

780
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,844
Speaker 1: I don't need to watch it again.

781
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:20,310
Speaker 1: space balls not hold up.

782
00:53:20,651 --> 00:53:22,539
Speaker 0: space balls is not as good as Blazing Saddles.

783
00:53:23,902 --> 00:53:25,920
Speaker 1: Men in tights does not actually hold up very well.

784
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:28,448
Speaker 0: It's in between the two we already met.

785
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:29,373
Speaker 1: it is in between the two.

786
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:33,139
Speaker 1: I will say that anyway I think I'm getting hungry, and we've talked enough about the matrix.
