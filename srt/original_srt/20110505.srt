1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,868
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 5th, 2011.

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:12,971
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:13,753
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:16,219
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights on the Cinco de Mayo.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,260
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about Al-Qaeda, Corona, Libya, Osama Bin Laden, all that stuff.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,879
Speaker 0: You know, Speedy Gonzalez.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,560
Speaker 1: That too.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,357
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,251
Speaker 0: So, you know, we're a big fan of the food trucks.

10
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:34,815
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

11
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:35,560
Speaker 1: every day.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,071
Speaker 1: Well, not every day, but every day the pizza truck is out.

13
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:39,800
Speaker 0: I've never seen a pizza truck.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,188
Speaker 1: It's in Midtown, like near Bryant Park.

15
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,380
Speaker 0: The thing is there's such a good pizza place near me.

16
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,100
Speaker 0: There's like 20 of them, but they're all touristy except one really good one.

17
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,935
Speaker 1: Ah, I got some really good pizza near me.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,833
Speaker 0: And of course every everything place has pizza also.

19
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:53,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that pizza's mediocre.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,724
Speaker 1: It's no Sbarro's.

21
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:58,920
Speaker 0: But there's actually a quality Italian pizza place right next to the office, don't even have to cross the street.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,347
Speaker 0: So why would I go to a pizza truck?

23
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,640
Speaker 1: Because all the pizza places that are good are good.

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,460
Speaker 1: They're fantastic pizza, but they are very specifically either proper Italian pizza or New York style pizza.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,084
Speaker 1: Which are the best kinds of pizza.

26
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:11,866
Speaker 1: Of course.

27
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:17,260
Speaker 1: But sometimes I do enjoy the Chicago style, the Boston style.

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:17,649
Speaker 1: I do not.

29
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:17,840
Speaker 1: I do not.

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,780
Speaker 1: And one kind of pizza I really do like is the super thin and crispy Sandella's kind of pizza.

31
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:25,560
Speaker 0: Alright, flatbread.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,744
Speaker 1: The pizza truck.

33
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:28,191
Speaker 0: I don't even consider that really a pizza.

34
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:29,919
Speaker 0: That's more of just a flatbread sandwich.

35
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:39,100
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'm looking and the truck appears to have that style of pizza.

36
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:41,592
Speaker 1: And it smells really fucking good.

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,880
Speaker 1: There's a gigantic line.

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:52,200
Speaker 1: So all the people who work near me who normally would go to the super awesome Little Italy pizza must be deciding consciously to go to this truck and stand in the longer line instead.

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,299
Speaker 0: So you went to Little Italy?

40
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went to Little Italy.

41
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,960
Speaker 0: Ashley, why don't you go to friggin' Two Boots underground central?

42
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,360
Speaker 1: 'Cause that Two Boots is the shittiest Two Boots.

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,460
Speaker 0: The shittiest Two Boots is still pretty good.

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Speaker 1: The thing is, the pizza seems like by the time they heat it up, one, they never heat it up as hot as it needs to get.

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,080
Speaker 1: And the service sucks and the line sucks and I just... Grand Central is not where you want to get lunch.

46
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,180
Speaker 1: But anyway, I always walk back from my lunch and see the pizza truck because I eat at like 11.

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,505
Speaker 1: Someday I just have to eat later.

48
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:24,674
Speaker 1: so I walk out and see the pizza truck and go, "Oh,

49
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:25,015
Speaker 1: right."

50
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:26,260
Speaker 1: And get a pizza.

51
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:27,726
Speaker 0: No, see, that's what I thought.

52
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,934
Speaker 0: There's a falafel truck that's been coming near me recently.

53
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,460
Speaker 0: There's a lot of falafel over there, actually.

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,219
Speaker 0: But there's one falafel truck in particular, the Taim falafel and smoothie truck, T-A-I-M.

55
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,079
Speaker 1: Nah, the falafel near me kinda sucks.

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,922
Speaker 0: And you know what?

57
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:43,580
Speaker 0: That truck, every day I see it, it's only there like once or twice a week.

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,319
Speaker 0: It has a crazy long line down the street.

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,847
Speaker 0: So one day I went over there at like 2.30.

60
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,636
Speaker 0: 'Cause it usually parks next to Europa Cafe, so I'm like, "Well, you know what?

61
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,120
Speaker 0: If there's a long line, I'll go to Europa

62
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,300
Speaker 0: Cafe.".

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,593
Speaker 0: 2.30 PM, I look and at the line, I don't see the line, so I'm like, "Oh boy, oh boy, oh

64
00:02:59,634 --> 00:02:59,914
Speaker 0: boy.".

65
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,920
Speaker 0: And I go to the other side of the truck.

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,346
Speaker 0: The line was entirely hidden behind the truck.

67
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:05,069
Speaker 0: It was gigantic.

68
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,440
Speaker 0: At 2.30 PM, there was a line for this falafel.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,460
Speaker 0: But anyway, a couple days ago, you know what I got?

70
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:11,177
Speaker 1: What'd you get?

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,198
Speaker 0: Crepe truck.

72
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:13,539
Speaker 1: Ah, you mean crepe.

73
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,000
Speaker 0: Crepe, savory crepe.

74
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,418
Speaker 1: Ah, shit, son.

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,160
Speaker 0: They also had the sweet, but I got the savory 'cause it was lunchtime.

76
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,945
Speaker 1: That's kinda crepe.

77
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,980
Speaker 1: It's something with like feta, some spinach.

78
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:22,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, they had that kinda thing.

79
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,258
Speaker 0: Maybe asparagus.

80
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,280
Speaker 1: Asparagus, some egg.

81
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,918
Speaker 0: But I got like chicken with some kind of cheese, I don't know what it was, and all kinds of vegetable of some kind.

82
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,040
Speaker 0: It was good.

83
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,430
Speaker 1: Ah.

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Speaker 1: But, you know, I've been riding my bike to work and the thing is, my building, which is the former Lincoln building, now one Grand Central place, those fuckers made sure the service elevator is basically impossible to use, so they are technically-.

85
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,060
Speaker 0: Well, what are the hours of the service elevator?

86
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,780
Speaker 1: Ah, it opens after I get to work and closes before I leave.

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's 'cause you work weird hours.

88
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,239
Speaker 1: No, basically almost no one could work the hours.

89
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,719
Speaker 0: But independent of that- My, 'cause mine is eight to six.

90
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:13,780
Speaker 1: Even then, if you wanna use it, these union asses take forever, they don't open it on time every day, you gotta wait for the guy to come down, open the elevator, let you in, you gotta like call-.

91
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,516
Speaker 0: That's what I do too.

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it takes like ten minutes on each end of my journey.

93
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,283
Speaker 0: Really?

94
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,000
Speaker 0: It only takes me like a couple minutes on each end.

95
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:27,860
Speaker 1: And even then, because the hours suck, I can't use it anyway, so I'm not riding my many thousand dollar performance hybrid to work.

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,720
Speaker 0: Your bike is not many thousand.

97
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,800
Speaker 1: I spent a couple thousand.

98
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:32,840
Speaker 0: That was too much for that bike.

99
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,199
Speaker 1: That bike is way better than your bike.

100
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,780
Speaker 0: That bike is not worth many thousand, there are better bikes that you can get than that for like one thousand.

101
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,900
Speaker 1: I mean, I got it on sale, I only paid like twenty one hundred, I think I forget.

102
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,860
Speaker 0: That's way too much money.

103
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,359
Speaker 1: Ah, nah, not really.

104
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:46,320
Speaker 1: Nah.

105
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:46,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

106
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,460
Speaker 1: Okay, mister gigantic gears in the back.

107
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,739
Speaker 0: Even the retail price of bikes on the official website is not that much for that bike.

108
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,560
Speaker 1: It's a good bike, I don't think you should ride my bike sometime and see.

109
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,820
Speaker 0: Well, let's go to the, what exactly model is your bike?

110
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,439
Speaker 1: I don't remember it, I have to go look it up.

111
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you maybe had got the rip rip off, if you know what I'm saying.

112
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,560
Speaker 1: Actually, I got that for about eight hundred, nine hundred dollars under MSRP, as I recall.

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:14,969
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

114
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,432
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:05:15,846 --> 00:05:16,538
Speaker 0: I doubt it.

116
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,380
Speaker 1: I had a smartphone when I was at the store.

117
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,140
Speaker 0: Your bike does not look like a two thousand dollar bike to me.

118
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
Speaker 1: Scott, it's completely different from your bike.

119
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,160
Speaker 0: Uh huh, anyway.

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,120
Speaker 1: Alright, so what do you think isn't different?

121
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,160
Speaker 1: I mean, the gearing is different, brakes are different.

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get a bike with those gears and those brakes for like a couple hundred dollars more than my bike.

123
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,200
Speaker 0: No, no you're not gonna.

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,319
Speaker 0: For multi thousand dollars, you can get a bike better than Lance Armstrong's bike.

125
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:41,220
Speaker 1: Uh, probably not actually.

126
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:45,400
Speaker 0: Actually, yes, Lance Armstrong's bike is between one and two thousand dollars on Trek.com.

127
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,520
Speaker 1: So a street bike, which is completely different from a hybrid.

128
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that you, there's no way you paid that much money, you paid too much.

129
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's have a bike race and we'll see what happens.

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,520
Speaker 0: We will.

131
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,100
Speaker 1: So I've been riding my fifteen, sixteen, almost seventeen year old mountain bike to work every day.

132
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,700
Speaker 0: Because who cares what happens to it.

133
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,880
Speaker 1: Like, you know, I can't risk my bike getting stolen, New York City has the highest rate of bike theft of any city in America.

134
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if your bike gets stolen, you just steal a different one.

135
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't seen bikes as nice as mine out there and my bike is such a target.

136
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,820
Speaker 1: So I'm driving that shitty old Schwinn, I took all the tape off of it from the guy who stole it before.

137
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:33,899
Speaker 1: And the difference between the two bikes, now that I'm riding both of them on a regular basis, and I'm riding the mountain bike a long distance, you know, three miles or so, after having had a real bike and ridden it.

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ, it takes me almost twice as long to get to work on the mountain bike as it does on my real bike.

139
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,439
Speaker 1: Literally twice as long.

140
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:48,160
Speaker 1: So yeah, I feel like I'm training on this shitty ass bike.

141
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,380
Speaker 1: When I take my awesome bike out on the weekends, it's gonna be like just butter.

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,318
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

143
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:52,905
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:54,800
Speaker 0: Anyway.

145
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,290
Speaker 1: Anyway?

146
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:56,560
Speaker 0: Anyway.

147
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:57,440
Speaker 1: Yeah?

148
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,760
Speaker 1: You said you had some sort of crazy opening bit, you had something to say.

149
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,282
Speaker 0: What?

150
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:03,259
Speaker 0: No, I just wanted to talk about the Crips.

151
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:04,339
Speaker 1: Oh, that's all you had?

152
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,119
Speaker 1: Because right before we did the show, Scott's like, "No, wait, wait, wait, I got a really good thing to start

153
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:08,300
Speaker 1: with.".

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you were talking about food trucks, I said I had a pre-opening bit and I wanted to talk about the Crip.

155
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,910
Speaker 1: That was it?

156
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:14,260
Speaker 1: The Crip?

157
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:15,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, Crip truck.

158
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,610
Speaker 1: Huh?

159
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,378
Speaker 1: Nothing beats the Potend truck down on St.

160
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:19,640
Speaker 1: Marks.

161
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:20,400
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

162
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,747
Speaker 0: Yeah.

163
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,079
Speaker 1: There's none of that near me.

164
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,697
Speaker 1: I should just bike down there and get it.

165
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:24,459
Speaker 0: You could.

166
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,740
Speaker 1: Because my other big revelation was, I have a bike at work, I can just go biking for like an hour instead of getting lunch.

167
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,375
Speaker 0: You could.

168
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I have been.

169
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:34,380
Speaker 0: Alright.

170
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:38,860
Speaker 1: I almost went over the Williamsburg Bridge, but I might not have made it back in time.

171
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,480
Speaker 1: So I just went to the base.

172
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,820
Speaker 0: You definitely would not have made it back in time.

173
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,779
Speaker 1: Well, I got to the base of the Williamsburg Bridge and then I sat and had lunch and then I biked back.

174
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:46,578
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:46,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

176
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:48,879
Speaker 1: So, Thursday.

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:49,765
Speaker 1: Yeah.

178
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:51,100
Speaker 1: Got something to talk about?

179
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,488
Speaker 0: Any news?

180
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:52,658
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

181
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,174
Speaker 1: Oh, do ya?

182
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:53,569
Speaker 0: Yeah.

183
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,400
Speaker 1: Doesn't have to be news.

184
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,260
Speaker 1: Remember, we used to call this the lounge.

185
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:58,940
Speaker 1: Talk about whatever we want.

186
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,298
Speaker 0: You were the only one who ever did that.

187
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:05,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you always complained, "I never have any news on Thursday because I don't care about normal

188
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:05,799
Speaker 1: stuff.".

189
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:06,591
Speaker 0: I don't.

190
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:07,839
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

191
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,119
Speaker 0: I don't care about nerdery.

192
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,160
Speaker 0: It's geek nights.

193
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,058
Speaker 0: It's not normal nights.

194
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,260
Speaker 0: If people wanted normal nights, they could go to the rest of the internet.

195
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, because there's nothing nerdy about sports or politics.

196
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:17,080
Speaker 0: That's right.

197
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:17,780
Speaker 1: Anyway.

198
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,139
Speaker 0: So check this out, right?

199
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,739
Speaker 0: There's some people in Turkey who are doing a big scam, right?

200
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,919
Speaker 0: And this is actually sort of a genius scam.

201
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,720
Speaker 1: Oh, is this the street gang with the tranquilizer pills?

202
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:33,080
Speaker 0: What they did is they would go to someone's house and they would pretend to be doctors.

203
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:35,000
Speaker 0: They guess they would wear lab coats.

204
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

205
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,222
Speaker 1: Dr.

206
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:37,739
Speaker 1: Mario is not a real doctor.

207
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:38,360
Speaker 0: That's right.

208
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:44,500
Speaker 0: And they would go and they would tell the people they were testing a new drug and they were going door to door pretending they were doing clinical trials.

209
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,059
Speaker 0: Clinical trials are not done door to door, but I guess people don't know that.

210
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,876
Speaker 1: There's a relevant line from Archer, which you don't watch, but the line is, "You weren't suspicious at all that your chemotherapy drugs were

211
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:57,278
Speaker 1: chewable.".

212
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:57,999
Speaker 0: Yeah.

213
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:08,579
Speaker 0: So they basically would go to someone's door, pretend to be doctors doing a clinical trial, make people, I guess, sign a paper or something and then give them a pill and suggest that they should take it immediately.

214
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,540
Speaker 0: And people took it and it was a tranquilizer.

215
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,158
Speaker 0: So they went to sleep and then the people robbed their house while they were tranquilized and left.

216
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,300
Speaker 1: Now, I cannot disparage the Pakistani or the Turkey because there's this study.

217
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,640
Speaker 1: I've seen articles about similar things in the past.

218
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,460
Speaker 1: This type of robbery is not a new thing.

219
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,060
Speaker 1: The police response to it is a new thing.

220
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,574
Speaker 0: So what the police did is they went around to people's houses pretending to be doctors.

221
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,260
Speaker 0: Basically, the police did exactly what the criminals did, only instead of using actual tranquilizers and robbing the people, they gave them placebos.

222
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,753
Speaker 0: And after, 86 out of 100 people took it.

223
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,660
Speaker 1: I imagine the cops being like, "Dude, that could have been poison.

224
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,600
Speaker 1: What the fuck's wrong with you?

225
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,908
Speaker 1: I'm not a

226
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,359
Speaker 1: doctor.".

227
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:53,919
Speaker 0: That's exactly what the police did.

228
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:57,996
Speaker 0: It says, "Police later returned to warn residents to be more

229
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:58,478
Speaker 0: cautious.".

230
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:07,300
Speaker 1: I cannot disparage the good citizens of Turkey, though, for being stupid because this shit would probably work almost as well in America.

231
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,320
Speaker 0: No, I'm not picking on the country.

232
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,300
Speaker 0: That just happens to be the country where it happened.

233
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,060
Speaker 0: I'm picking on all people.

234
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,980
Speaker 0: All people are this stupid.

235
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,120
Speaker 1: I say that not stupid, not stupid, gullible.

236
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:18,239
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

237
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,238
Speaker 0: Stupidity exists.

238
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:22,280
Speaker 1: It can be independent of gullibility.

239
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:23,759
Speaker 0: I think the same thing, mostly.

240
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:26,859
Speaker 0: I guess it's like a subset.

241
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,020
Speaker 0: Gullibility is a type of stupidity.

242
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:39,700
Speaker 1: But I say this because, remember a while ago, there was a series of vandalism incidents in hotels where someone would call a random room and be like, "There's a gas leak.

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,158
Speaker 1: You need to break your window right the fuck now or you're going to

244
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:43,460
Speaker 1: die.".

245
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,880
Speaker 1: And a lot of people would just throw the TV out the window.

246
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:50,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, because of the gas leak, the warning is going to be a telephone call.

247
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:55,360
Speaker 0: Well, it's weird because I don't- And you're not going to smell the gas at all.

248
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Speaker 1: Because on one hand, there is a problem in general with fraud, especially petty fraud, where someone rips off a cashier for 50 bucks and change, where the people who are gotten often won't go to the police because they feel embarrassed and they were stupid.

249
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:19,614
Speaker 1: Simultaneously, the police often won't take these things seriously because they feel- They're not big enough.

250
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,140
Speaker 1: There was an evil person who did very clearly commit an act of fraud.

251
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:39,060
Speaker 1: And I am very- personally, forget morals, forget ethics, personally, I have mixed feelings because on one hand, you are stupid if you fall for some dude calling your hotel in the middle of the night and telling you to throw the TV out the window.

252
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:39,659
Speaker 0: That's right.

253
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:41,439
Speaker 0: And you're the one who did it.

254
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,980
Speaker 1: On the other hand, the guy who called you also does not deserve praise.

255
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,279
Speaker 0: That's true as well.

256
00:11:47,781 --> 00:12:01,260
Speaker 1: But I do feel, personally, and I do not put this forth as a way the legal system should be, this is just my personal visceral opinion, the dude who throws the TV out the window should have to pay for all the damages.

257
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:05,000
Speaker 0: I disagree partially.

258
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:14,240
Speaker 1: Well simultaneously, if you catch the person who told them to do it, that person should be equally liable for the same amount.

259
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Speaker 1: So if you catch them both, either they both have to pay 50% or they both pay 100% putatively, and the extra money goes into some sort of educational fund.

260
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,607
Speaker 0: That's okay.

261
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:25,439
Speaker 0: I can do that.

262
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,357
Speaker 1: I just, I don't know.

263
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:34,140
Speaker 0: But I mean, okay, but the person who takes tranquilizers and gets their house robbed shouldn't have to pay.

264
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,417
Speaker 1: No, so what's the difference between the two?

265
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,420
Speaker 0: Because the person got their own house- see if you vandalize a motel, you hurt the motel owner.

266
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,320
Speaker 0: If you let your house get robbed because you're a moron, why should you be penalized?

267
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,280
Speaker 0: It's like you damaged yourself.

268
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,036
Speaker 0: So, so, so.

269
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:52,840
Speaker 0: And it was negligent, it's not active.

270
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,720
Speaker 1: Scott, you were already penalized because all your shit's gone.

271
00:12:56,381 --> 00:13:03,020
Speaker 0: So maybe it would be okay if your house insurance didn't pay out because you let your house be robbed.

272
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,180
Speaker 1: Should there be a clause in renters' insurance for gross stupidity?

273
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:09,400
Speaker 0: I think there is already sort of stuff like that.

274
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
Speaker 0: Like if you burn your own house down, you don't get arson insurance.

275
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,898
Speaker 0: So if you let your house get robbed, why should you get-.

276
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:29,680
Speaker 1: But Scott, burn your house down, as in I spread a bunch of gasoline and lit it, is very different from burn the house down because I turned on the oven and then I put oily rags in it to dry them out and then I fell asleep.

277
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:38,200
Speaker 0: Okay, no, I'm talking about the situation here is more akin to I was having, I decided to set off 100,000 fireworks in the backyard.

278
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,120
Speaker 0: Yee-haw, oops, house on fire.

279
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,040
Speaker 0: That you shouldn't have to get insurance, the insurance shouldn't have to pay for that because you were doing something stupid.

280
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,760
Speaker 1: I think you should have the option of getting insurance for that.

281
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,240
Speaker 0: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

282
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,158
Speaker 0: But by default, homeowners insurance doesn't need to cover that shit.

283
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,379
Speaker 1: Yep, so here's the question.

284
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Speaker 0: It should be like flood where you got to buy the extra.

285
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,160
Speaker 0: It's like you want to be stupid, you want the right to be even dumber, you got to pay more.

286
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,600
Speaker 1: That's why I'm saying in the case of the- I mean, you could buy insurance- It's throwing the TVs out the window, they should have to pay for the damage they caused.

287
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:05,040
Speaker 1: Yes.

288
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,320
Speaker 1: But in the case of the house being robbed because you took pills a stranger gave you, you already hurt yourself, you didn't hurt anyone else.

289
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,080
Speaker 1: So there's no punishment to be given, you've already punished yourself by losing all your stuff.

290
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:24,240
Speaker 1: I doubt many people who were affected by this in Turkey had renters insurance, at least like we do.

291
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,300
Speaker 0: Well, if they own the house, they have homeowners insurance.

292
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:30,540
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, because everyone in the world has homeowners insurance available to them.

293
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,058
Speaker 0: They don't have homeowners insurance as like a required thing, like everyone has?

294
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:35,600
Speaker 0: Probably not.

295
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,258
Speaker 0: Why not?

296
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,160
Speaker 0: Most places are not- Turkey's a normal place, it's not like some backwater hole.

297
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 1: I know, Scott, but you realize very few places in the world have the insurance requirements that the US does for anything.

298
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,040
Speaker 0: So in France, you don't have to have homeowners insurance to get a house?

299
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,080
Speaker 1: Every country's different.

300
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,659
Speaker 0: Anyone from Turkey, let us know if homeowners insurance is required to own a house.

301
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,900
Speaker 1: Plus, Scott, remember, it's not a law necessarily, but it's a requirement for the mortgage.

302
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,600
Speaker 0: What if you have no mortgage?

303
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,220
Speaker 1: Well, then maybe you don't need to have homeowners insurance.

304
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,240
Speaker 0: Well, what about, are you telling me the Turkish banks don't require insurance?

305
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,752
Speaker 1: But at the same time, what area of Turkey is this?

306
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:09,080
Speaker 1: How many people have mortgages?

307
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,353
Speaker 0: Uh, residents of the southeastern city of Gaziantep.

308
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,587
Speaker 1: Alright, how are the demographics there?

309
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,260
Speaker 1: Is it mostly homeowners or is it renters?

310
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,280
Speaker 0: I don't know, go on Google Earth and go to Gaziantep and take a look.

311
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,403
Speaker 0: You know what I'm saying?

312
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:43,880
Speaker 1: I am just guessing, randomly, putting forth all the biases I have and the ignorance I own about Turkey to say that I am guessing that the majority of the people who were caught by the "take these pills, I'm a stranger" scam did not have insurance that would cover losing all your shit due to taking pills from strangers.

313
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,540
Speaker 0: Alright, send all your Turkish racism hate to rim at FrontRecruit.com.

314
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,939
Speaker 1: It's not racism, it's Turkism.

315
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, Turkism.

316
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,873
Speaker 1: I'm just, I'm guessing.

317
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,699
Speaker 1: This is my guess.

318
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,900
Speaker 0: I'm pretty confident that Turkey is a completely normal place.

319
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:57,586
Speaker 1: It is.

320
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:58,980
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing that...

321
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,560
Speaker 0: That they have insurance like all other places that are normal.

322
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:07,320
Speaker 1: I would bet that in most of the world, even the industrialized world, a lot of people do not have insurance.

323
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,220
Speaker 0: I'm sure they have insurance.

324
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,960
Speaker 1: A lot of people in New York do not have renters insurance.

325
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,886
Speaker 0: They have banks.

326
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,540
Speaker 0: Well, renters insurance isn't required by law.

327
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's required by contract only and many leases require it and people just don't keep it.

328
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,518
Speaker 0: I've never seen a lease that requires it.

329
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,499
Speaker 1: A lot of leases do.

330
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,180
Speaker 0: Never seen one.

331
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually my lease requires that there be carpets on 75% of the non-kitchen, non-bathroom floors.

332
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:30,239
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

333
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:31,280
Speaker 1: Or I can be evicted.

334
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:32,157
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

335
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

336
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,740
Speaker 0: Mine doesn't say anything like that.

337
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,725
Speaker 1: A lot of leases say that.

338
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:37,380
Speaker 1: That exact clause is in most New York leases apparently.

339
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:38,009
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

340
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,020
Speaker 1: So yeah, talking about morals and ethics, here's the situation and this really happened in Cairo.

341
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:46,540
Speaker 0: Egypt.

342
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:47,360
Speaker 1: Missouri.

343
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:47,957
Speaker 0: Alright.

344
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,180
Speaker 1: Not to be confused with Missouri.

345
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,498
Speaker 0: Or Cairo, New York.

346
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,120
Speaker 1: It also involves not the Mississippi River, but the Ohio River.

347
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,900
Speaker 1: So basically, you've got a situation where there's a town, town of Cairo.

348
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:01,580
Speaker 0: Okay.

349
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
Speaker 0: Huge flooding.

350
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,079
Speaker 1: Levees might burst.

351
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:05,999
Speaker 0: Okay.

352
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,499
Speaker 1: There's no way to shore up the levees.

353
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,316
Speaker 0: No way.

354
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,679
Speaker 0: There's absolutely no way.

355
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,618
Speaker 1: Not in a reasonable span of time.

356
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,460
Speaker 0: Could you always just make them taller?

357
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:15,720
Speaker 1: Taller isn't the issue.

358
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,359
Speaker 1: It's that because the water is near the top already, the levee could just break.

359
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:20,540
Speaker 0: Any minute.

360
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,540
Speaker 0: Well, just make it taller.

361
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,500
Speaker 1: How's that going to help prevent it from breaking?

362
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,900
Speaker 0: Uh, make it thicker.

363
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,479
Speaker 1: How are you going to make it thicker in a hurry?

364
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,359
Speaker 0: Concrete.

365
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:30,856
Speaker 0: Pour it.

366
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,500
Speaker 1: Pour it into what?

367
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,900
Speaker 0: You put up a big wooden wall about a foot back from the existing wall.

368
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,140
Speaker 1: Scott, do you know how long it takes for concrete to cure?

369
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,080
Speaker 0: And you pour the concrete in between the old wall and the wood wall.

370
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:54,596
Speaker 1: Scott, what unit of measurement for our great dam, the biggest dam in the US, what unit of measurement do you think would be used to determine how long it took for that concrete to set?

371
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,219
Speaker 1: Minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years?

372
00:17:57,602 --> 00:17:57,795
Speaker 0: Days?

373
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,247
Speaker 1: Years.

374
00:17:58,925 --> 00:17:58,968
Speaker 1: No.

375
00:17:59,363 --> 00:17:59,470
Speaker 0: Years.

376
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:00,320
Speaker 0: Years.

377
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,078
Speaker 0: Hoover Dam.

378
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,390
Speaker 1: Years.

379
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:01,706
Speaker 1: No.

380
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,320
Speaker 1: Anyway.

381
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:04,660
Speaker 0: That shitty concrete.

382
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,459
Speaker 0: Get Roman concrete.

383
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,018
Speaker 1: This shitty levee is- Could burst.

384
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,670
Speaker 0: Steel wall.

385
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,259
Speaker 1: Destroying an entire town.

386
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,098
Speaker 0: Why did you live there?

387
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:19,120
Speaker 1: So, here's an option.

388
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,180
Speaker 0: The option was- That's like moving to the place in Pennsylvania where the coal mines are on fire.

389
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,519
Speaker 1: The thing is, the levee was fine, and there was a plan to be able to get around this.

390
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,459
Speaker 1: To save the levee.

391
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,760
Speaker 0: Doesn't this happen every year, though?

392
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:30,136
Speaker 1: No.

393
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,742
Speaker 1: The last time this happened was in 1937.

394
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:34,040
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

395
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:34,800
Speaker 0: So it's not too bad.

396
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,037
Speaker 0: All right.

397
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:55,540
Speaker 1: So, the plan to fix this, that could be enacted, was to pump a large section of the levee at a different point full of liquid explosives, blow it the fuck up, thus causing the water to destroy countless acres of farmland, and destroy tons of homes in that area, but save the much larger town of Cairo and its surroundings.

398
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,736
Speaker 1: And theoretically, possibly prevent further levee problems in other areas in the coming days.

399
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:02,956
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

400
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:04,639
Speaker 1: So, what are the ethics?

401
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:29,780
Speaker 1: Do you think it is more ethical to leave the levees in place, risking a fairly substantial chance that the levee will burst suddenly and catastrophically somewhere along its banks, probably destroying the entire town of Cairo, or at least putting the entire town of Cairo under 15 feet of immediate floodwater, or purposefully destroying a portion of the levee, destroying 100 or more homes, and a whole ton of farmland?

402
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:30,320
Speaker 0: All right.

403
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,420
Speaker 0: Well, the first thing you got to question is, is there a third option?

404
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:34,756
Speaker 0: No.

405
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:36,600
Speaker 0: There's absolutely no third option.

406
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,459
Speaker 0: Well, then all the other- You can't use a bunch of helicopters to remove all the water.

407
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:40,850
Speaker 0: No.

408
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,980
Speaker 0: You can't pump the water into a sewer.

409
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:43,756
Speaker 1: No.

410
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:45,660
Speaker 1: None of those options were feasible.

411
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,559
Speaker 0: You can't get a big water pipe and bring the water to Arizona where they really need it.

412
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:55,040
Speaker 1: You realize none of those options are feasible from any engineering perspective.

413
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,660
Speaker 1: But anyway, no.

414
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,220
Speaker 0: You can't just fill up a boat with water and sail it away.

415
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:01,939
Speaker 1: How big a boat ... How much water do you think this is?

416
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:02,719
Speaker 0: A lot.

417
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:03,296
Speaker 0: A lot.

418
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,520
Speaker 0: All the water in a river.

419
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:05,880
Speaker 1: It's a lot of water.

420
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,519
Speaker 0: It's a big river.

421
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,660
Speaker 0: It's not like a tiny stream.

422
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,539
Speaker 0: It's a river river.

423
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,598
Speaker 1: So anyway, they did blow up part of the levee.

424
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,738
Speaker 1: They spent days pumping liquid explosives into a large section, and then they blew it the fuck up.

425
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:18,379
Speaker 0: Nice.

426
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,168
Speaker 1: Destroyed 130,000 acres of farmland.

427
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,660
Speaker 0: That's a lot.

428
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,759
Speaker 0: Whose farmland was that?

429
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,140
Speaker 1: Just various farmers.

430
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,540
Speaker 0: Various farmers.

431
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:27,960
Speaker 0: Okay.

432
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,540
Speaker 1: Now, here's the thing.

433
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,660
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell, the area that they ended up flooding is called river bottom.

434
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,119
Speaker 0: And until relatively recently- It was the river bottom?

435
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:46,440
Speaker 1: It was a flood plain designed to be there so that they could breach the levee- But people moved into it.

436
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, farmers moved into it because the farmland was really rich.

437
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,579
Speaker 1: Because it was a flood plain.

438
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,500
Speaker 0: It was a river bottom full of sediment.

439
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,760
Speaker 1: And the real problem here is the same problem we've seen in many places.

440
00:20:57,602 --> 00:21:03,519
Speaker 1: We have an abatement, an easement, a flood plain, some sort of buffer between humans and disaster.

441
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,580
Speaker 1: Because occasionally there are disasters.

442
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,360
Speaker 1: And then people decide that the risk is worth it, and they move into the flood plain.

443
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,640
Speaker 1: Then they complain when it floods.

444
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,596
Speaker 0: Okay.

445
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:18,740
Speaker 0: So, but the same thing could be said of Cairo itself, right?

446
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,720
Speaker 0: It was basically two people being stupid on both sides.

447
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,513
Speaker 1: Ah, but Cairo was there as a town first.

448
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:26,800
Speaker 0: First.

449
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,650
Speaker 0: So they were the first morons.

450
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,419
Speaker 0: The other people were the second morons.

451
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,400
Speaker 1: Here's the cool thing, Scott.

452
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,356
Speaker 1: How big of a gap do you think they blew up in the levee?

453
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,280
Speaker 0: A hundred thousand acres of farmland?

454
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,139
Speaker 0: Were destroyed.

455
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:42,560
Speaker 0: They probably, and they used liquid explosives?

456
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,420
Speaker 1: Liquid explosives.

457
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,034
Speaker 0: They probably blew up at least 20 miles of levee.

458
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
Speaker 1: Nope, they blew up a two mile gap.

459
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:48,918
Speaker 0: All right.

460
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,578
Speaker 0: This is miles.

461
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:52,880
Speaker 1: A tiny village called Pin Hook was completely flooded.

462
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:53,556
Speaker 0: Okay.

463
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,580
Speaker 0: Did they let the people know before they flooded it?

464
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:56,680
Speaker 0: I assume they did.

465
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,978
Speaker 0: Did they compensate those people?

466
00:21:58,322 --> 00:21:58,618
Speaker 1: I don't know.

467
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,399
Speaker 0: Did those people have flood insurance?

468
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,220
Speaker 1: Probably the insurance companies would not give them flood insurance.

469
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:06,799
Speaker 0: Well, I mean.

470
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:17,660
Speaker 1: I just thought this was an interesting story because it is many times when we have ethical arguments in the front room crew forums, people always trot out the hypotheticals.

471
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:26,799
Speaker 1: Like, say there's a trolley on a track that's going to kill three people, but you have the power to hit a switch and divert it to where it will only kill one person instead on a different track.

472
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:28,199
Speaker 1: Is it ethical to do so?

473
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:29,498
Speaker 0: It's like that would never happen.

474
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,160
Speaker 1: Well, here's the situation.

475
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,459
Speaker 1: Do we blow up the levee and destroy all these towns?

476
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:38,280
Speaker 1: Or do we not blow it up and risk the very real sudden disaster of this much larger town?

477
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,700
Speaker 0: I still question whether how much effort they put into finding a third way.

478
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,780
Speaker 1: Scott, the sheer amount of water.

479
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:55,359
Speaker 1: You realize blowing up the levee and destroying all that farmland, the rest of the levee, all the, you know, everything behind the levee, all that water, there wasn't some other levee they could blow up.

480
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,319
Speaker 1: That water dropped about a foot.

481
00:22:58,526 --> 00:22:59,259
Speaker 1: Only a foot.

482
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,080
Speaker 0: There wasn't some other levee somewhere.

483
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,672
Speaker 1: No, that was pretty much the best, safest place.

484
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,000
Speaker 1: they could possibly do anything.

485
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,600
Speaker 0: Couldn't they just.

486
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,299
Speaker 1: There are two hundred and forty one miles of levees.

487
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,106
Speaker 0: OK.

488
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:11,826
Speaker 0: How about?

489
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:12,858
Speaker 0: here's what you should do.

490
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:15,139
Speaker 0: Everyone back the fuck up.

491
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:17,200
Speaker 1: All right.

492
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,678
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

493
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
Speaker 0: Like along the whole river.

494
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,599
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, we're going to blow this one up now.

495
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,439
Speaker 0: Everyone else has 10 years to get out because we're blowing everything up.

496
00:23:26,063 --> 00:23:27,799
Speaker 0: And then the river is going to be as wide as it used to be.

497
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,659
Speaker 0: Tough shit, everybody.

498
00:23:29,082 --> 00:23:30,760
Speaker 0: You're all stupid for moving here in the first place.

499
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:32,078
Speaker 0: Then you'll never have the problem again.

500
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:37,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, that doesn't really address the immediate ethical concern of what do you do right now?

501
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960
Speaker 0: Well, it's just who's going to be first.

502
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,396
Speaker 1: Because, Scott, you realize what you are.

503
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,060
Speaker 1: Captain Hindsight.

504
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:46,539
Speaker 1: Not that I should have thought of that before.

505
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
Speaker 0: No, that wasn't a Captain Hindsight.

506
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,835
Speaker 0: There was a future saying it's like, hey, listen, you know, it's got.

507
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:55,700
Speaker 1: I believe what you were saying is that Captain Hindsight has a brother, Commander Forsythe.

508
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:56,219
Speaker 0: That's right.

509
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:59,140
Speaker 1: Kind of like Prometheus and Epimetheus.

510
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,340
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's not even Forsythe.

511
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,900
Speaker 0: It's basically, you know, it's like, OK, I see what happened.

512
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:05,297
Speaker 0: Yes.

513
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:08,780
Speaker 0: But now I'm saying we know what's going to happen in the future already.

514
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:10,139
Speaker 1: Scott, this is what we should do.

515
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,700
Speaker 1: This is one of those every hundred years disasters.

516
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:16,000
Speaker 0: So that means you should be stupid for a hundred years.

517
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,020
Speaker 1: No, it means that what should people be allowed to assume these sorts of risks?

518
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:35,100
Speaker 1: Should the farmers who went into this ultra fertile land fully aware that this sort of thing could happen, not be able to knowingly accept that risk for the likely ninety nine years of fertile farming, followed by one year of destruction?

519
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:38,379
Speaker 0: I guess if you want to.

520
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:47,540
Speaker 1: My only beef is that people complain and possibly that tax dollars end up subsidizing their subsequent stupid decisions.

521
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,139
Speaker 0: It's weird.

522
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,979
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, there's the obvious similar situation where I bought a house on an airport and I complained about the noise.

523
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:55,357
Speaker 0: Yep.

524
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:56,000
Speaker 0: Right.

525
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,060
Speaker 1: That happened in Michigan near me when I was a kid.

526
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,897
Speaker 1: There was an awesome shooting range that had been there since like the 20s.

527
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Speaker 0: But this is more like you bought a house on an old abandoned airport and then rent and then suddenly they decided to start using it again.

528
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,300
Speaker 1: It's like at the same time, if the airport, you know, you had to do your due diligence.

529
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:18,499
Speaker 1: If the airport wasn't condemned and was still able to become an active airport, you made your bed.

530
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,238
Speaker 0: No, it was condemned, but they renovated it.

531
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:21,120
Speaker 1: All right.

532
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:21,940
Speaker 1: So what was the zoning?

533
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,987
Speaker 1: I mean, was this what the zoning still have allowed the airport to someday possibly come back?

534
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,140
Speaker 0: Well, your mistake was that you only bought a tiny square in the middle of the airport.

535
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,680
Speaker 0: You didn't actually buy the whole airport.

536
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:31,799
Speaker 1: But did you know?

537
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,955
Speaker 1: I mean, if you don't do your research and know whether or not it could turn into an airport again, then fuck you, man.

538
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:40,319
Speaker 0: At least they told the people to leave and they didn't drown.

539
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,220
Speaker 1: I assume the article doesn't actually specific.

540
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:44,900
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure nobody drowned.

541
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,249
Speaker 1: Yeah.

542
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,880
Speaker 0: Plus, the other thing is you can always pick up your whole house to put it on a truck and go along.

543
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:53,397
Speaker 1: That takes.

544
00:25:54,092 --> 00:25:54,260
Speaker 0: Yeah.

545
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:56,860
Speaker 0: But it's like how much advance notice did they have here?

546
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:57,700
Speaker 0: It takes days.

547
00:25:58,428 --> 00:25:58,880
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

548
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,806
Speaker 0: They had.

549
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,760
Speaker 0: they only had to make this decision within days.

550
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:02,178
Speaker 1: Yeah.

551
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:04,580
Speaker 0: Did they put the liquid explosive in the dam that quickly?

552
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:04,871
Speaker 1: Yeah.

553
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,020
Speaker 1: That's pretty fast.

554
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:08,507
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like floods.

555
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:11,935
Speaker 1: give you a lot of warning like, hey, I'm going to flood next week.

556
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:14,798
Speaker 0: Didn't they know that it was rising?

557
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:15,940
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

558
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,020
Speaker 0: It was in a flash flood.

559
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:17,800
Speaker 0: I don't know.

560
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,260
Speaker 1: I didn't read the article that in depth.

561
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,278
Speaker 0: You gotta have more notice than that.

562
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:27,200
Speaker 1: But I guess complaining is the only thing that bothers me and hypocrisy because I mean, right now, look at what's going on with the Republicans.

563
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:33,040
Speaker 1: They complain, can complain about how the federal government shouldn't waste money and help people out and be socialist.

564
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:38,419
Speaker 1: And then they complain that the federal government isn't giving them money to deal with all the tornadoes that are happening.

565
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:39,580
Speaker 0: Huh?

566
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

567
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:52,550
Speaker 1: Anyway, so things of the day, what do you got for me?

568
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,367
Speaker 0: So check this out.

569
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:02,868
Speaker 0: These dudes, they took a Kinect, right, which is a Kinect is a Microsoft Kinect, you know, and which is basically webcam that can also detect depth.

570
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,708
Speaker 1: Yep.

571
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,968
Speaker 0: And they combined it with a 3D printer.

572
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:08,529
Speaker 1: Beach of a Wookie.

573
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,510
Speaker 0: That's right.

574
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:18,750
Speaker 0: They take that and they they basically they take a picture of you and they basically create a 3D model of you and then they take that 3D model and put it inside.

575
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:26,730
Speaker 0: You know, they basically put it in the middle of a rectangular 3D model and then they print out a you a miniature you in carbonite.

576
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:27,366
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

577
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,790
Speaker 1: So you realize that this exact same advance could be used to advance teledildonics.

578
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,249
Speaker 0: It could indeed.

579
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:34,635
Speaker 1: Yes.

580
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:35,738
Speaker 0: It could also.

581
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,089
Speaker 0: the resolution isn't high enough yet, though.

582
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,788
Speaker 0: But yet I saw another example where they were just making miniature figurines of people straight up.

583
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:44,210
Speaker 1: I kind of like the carbonite thing better.

584
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:45,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not bad.

585
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:52,589
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you got to be pretty fucking cool to have a carbonite of you on your wall.

586
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,190
Speaker 0: Yep.

587
00:27:53,351 --> 00:28:12,168
Speaker 0: Another good idea, though, I was thinking for this right, is we could bring a Kinect to like a museum and go find like, you know, say Venus de Milo type sculptures or, you know, Michelangelo's David type sculptures, scan them, you know, walk around them with a Kinect a little bit and go home and print out, you know, miniature David's.

588
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,810
Speaker 0: because we don't we don't have big printers.

589
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:20,310
Speaker 0: But if you had a big printer, we could print out Michelangelo's David's that were accurate to, you know, a very small high resolution.

590
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:28,730
Speaker 1: Going back to I'm not going I was going to quote the Goonies because for some reason all this reminds me of is when they broke the dick off the statue in the beginning.

591
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:41,110
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, we could basically we could start, you know, basically printing out copies of famous sculptures, you know, like we have, you know, you can buy prints of famous paintings.

592
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,650
Speaker 1: Well, what are we going to do someday?

593
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,530
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know.

594
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:49,209
Speaker 0: Is there is there a place that will sell you like, you know, a copy of, you know, a Venus de Milo?

595
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,270
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the answer is yes.

596
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,250
Speaker 0: How much does it cost?

597
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,089
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

598
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,829
Speaker 1: Look on Amazon.

599
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:54,520
Speaker 0: All right.

600
00:28:55,131 --> 00:29:02,850
Speaker 1: So while you look that up, I found it's kind of a blog slash web site, but I think it's worthy of attention.

601
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,910
Speaker 1: I'm not know the website is cool, but I'm linking to a specific entry in it.

602
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:12,470
Speaker 1: It is called The Art of Manliness, and it is telling you how to be a proper man.

603
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:23,910
Speaker 1: It does articles on things like how to use a straight razor, how to properly iron a dress shoot, a men's guide to looking like Cary Grant, you know, cool stuff like that.

604
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:31,529
Speaker 1: But they have one article here, Lessons in Manliness, about one of the baddest asses in the history of the American Old West.

605
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:32,564
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

606
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,941
Speaker 1: Bass Reeves was a black deputy U.S.

607
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:39,930
Speaker 1: marshal in the Indian territories already.

608
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:41,630
Speaker 1: He was invincible.

609
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:45,228
Speaker 1: He shot a lot of people, captured like three thousand felons.

610
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,350
Speaker 0: Well, I don't think that no one can capture three thousand felons in his whole career.

611
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,370
Speaker 1: Thirty two years.

612
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,969
Speaker 0: You're going to text.

613
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,659
Speaker 0: You're going to tell me.

614
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,390
Speaker 0: he lived in 10 Pokemon.

615
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:54,609
Speaker 1: This guy basically did.

616
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:55,389
Speaker 0: No way.

617
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,490
Speaker 1: This guy is just one of those.

618
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,809
Speaker 0: If you try to catch three thousand felons, one of them is going to kill you.

619
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,706
Speaker 1: You know what?

620
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,249
Speaker 1: He shot a lot of them.

621
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:04,847
Speaker 0: I'm just there's no way.

622
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:06,975
Speaker 1: Well, this is a.

623
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:11,050
Speaker 0: this is Paul Bunyan territory now that I haven't done full research.

624
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,490
Speaker 0: How many blue oxen did he have?

625
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,550
Speaker 1: But I did a little bit of research, and it seems to be at least partially legit.

626
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,008
Speaker 0: Apparently, because he was three felons.

627
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,590
Speaker 1: The area he was in was notorious for outlaws heading there to hide out.

628
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,548
Speaker 1: So basically, subpoenas would come in.

629
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:29,430
Speaker 0: So he had a fell in honey pot is what you're saying.

630
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,450
Speaker 1: So basically, he'd just go out to the area where they'd hide.

631
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,210
Speaker 1: The felons would fucking put up signs.

632
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,029
Speaker 1: There was an area I'll quote the article 80 miles west from Fort Smith was an area known as the deadline.

633
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:48,604
Speaker 1: And whenever a deputy marshal from Fort Smith or Paris, Texas, crossed the Missouri, Kansas and Texas track, he took his own life into his hands on.

634
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:55,530
Speaker 1: nearly every trail would be found posted by outlaws, a small card warning certain deputies that if they cross this line, their lives were forfeit.

635
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:02,230
Speaker 1: So Reeves would collect those cards as he went off to fuck these people up.

636
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:03,290
Speaker 1: There's a story.

637
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,389
Speaker 1: I do not know if this is apocryphal or not.

638
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:06,349
Speaker 1: I cannot.

639
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,350
Speaker 0: Are these cards available in a museum?

640
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:09,148
Speaker 1: I don't know.

641
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:15,868
Speaker 1: I cannot verify if the story is true, but supposedly at one point, a bunch of outlaws got together and tried to assassinate him.

642
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:16,990
Speaker 0: So they caught him.

643
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,729
Speaker 0: Good job, guys.

644
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:19,150
Speaker 1: And they get up close.

645
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:20,750
Speaker 1: One guy's got a gun trained on him.

646
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,269
Speaker 1: The other guy's up close with a gun at him and they get him off his horse and they ask him if he has any last words.

647
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:32,609
Speaker 1: He says that there's a letter from his mama in his pack and he would be much obliged if they would read it to him one last time before they shot him.

648
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:39,166
Speaker 1: So the guy says, all right, I see the moment he even glances toward the horse where the pack is.

649
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,230
Speaker 1: This dude grabs him by the neck and screams, son of a bitch, you're under arrest now.

650
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:48,505
Speaker 1: And his partner was so startled that before he could shoot him, he turned around and basically got him both.

651
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:52,589
Speaker 1: Just son of a bitch, you're under arrest.

652
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,030
Speaker 0: Someone's going to make a movie.

653
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,271
Speaker 0: All right.

654
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:58,730
Speaker 0: David by Michelangelo, 12 inch statue, marble finish.

655
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:01,050
Speaker 0: It looks pretty close to the original.

656
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:01,696
Speaker 0: All right.

657
00:32:01,717 --> 00:32:02,569
Speaker 0: Thirty five dollars.

658
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

659
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:06,690
Speaker 1: So I don't think there's a market for printing your own just yet.

660
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:17,235
Speaker 0: I'm just saying if you want, you know, you could also do all sorts of other things like, you know, any sort of object you have in your house that you might want to duplicate in physical shape, like.

661
00:32:17,295 --> 00:32:20,750
Speaker 0: maybe you've got, you know, what, what.

662
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:22,395
Speaker 1: I'm looking around the room.

663
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:27,390
Speaker 1: There is nothing where a crude simulacrum of its physical shape would in any way help me in this room.

664
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,734
Speaker 0: You could buy an action figure and then make illegal pirated copies of crappy unpainted ones.

665
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:32,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had to paint them.

666
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:41,035
Speaker 0: That could be a fun activity, though, if you have an action figure and then you want to paint it exactly like or if you think the paint job in the action figure sucks, just repaint it.

667
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,470
Speaker 0: A lot of people that is a hobby.

668
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:48,490
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying you could look at the original while you're painting the new one or you could just buy two of the action figures.

669
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,000
Speaker 1: I guess I could duplicate this 2007 Parsec Award.

670
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, OK.

671
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:53,870
Speaker 0: Or you could use it as paperweight.

672
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,830
Speaker 1: Well, I knocked LuPone off of it while I was trying to grab him.

673
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,763
Speaker 0: You could duplicate LuPone.

674
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:57,149
Speaker 1: Yeah.

675
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,112
Speaker 0: Anyway.

676
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:02,930
Speaker 1: But anyway, the meta moment, the book club book is still as a mobs foundation.

677
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,350
Speaker 1: If you're a nerd or a geek, you should have read these books.

678
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:05,912
Speaker 0: Yeah.

679
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:09,799
Speaker 0: So we're just doing the first one first, just because, you know, we should probably do all three.

680
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:10,590
Speaker 1: I'll read them all.

681
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,941
Speaker 1: But we're just going to talk about it.

682
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:13,130
Speaker 0: But I bought the trilogy.

683
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,470
Speaker 0: I think there's more than that, actually.

684
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:21,190
Speaker 1: The unofficial book club book is the entirety of the Prince of Nothing series, because there are now five Prince of Nothing books.

685
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:21,894
Speaker 1: I've read them all.

686
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:24,270
Speaker 1: Scott's rereading all of them to get up to that point.

687
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,010
Speaker 1: And it was, I think, the first book we did in the Geek Nights book club.

688
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,590
Speaker 1: And many, many listeners are suddenly reading them again.

689
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:38,690
Speaker 1: So you will be able to follow the illustrious trend of the front row crew, where one of us read the Prince of Nothing, tricked another person to reading it.

690
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:42,190
Speaker 1: They raved about it and convinced the rest of us to read it.

691
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,770
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of fantasy novels out there.

692
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,510
Speaker 0: Nerds like fantasy novels, you know, and there's Games of Thrones.

693
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,589
Speaker 0: I've heard of those.

694
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:49,469
Speaker 0: Locke Lamora.

695
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,613
Speaker 0: Locke Lamora.

696
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:54,530
Speaker 0: There's Dragonlands, Dragon this, Dragon that, Dragon everything.

697
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,349
Speaker 0: Don't read Dragonlands.

698
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,450
Speaker 0: Forgotten Realms.

699
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,410
Speaker 1: You really don't want to read anything with dragon in the title.

700
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,990
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, there's Lord of the Rings, there's all these fantasy novel series.

701
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,416
Speaker 0: They're big.

702
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:03,929
Speaker 0: Or Forgotten.

703
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,651
Speaker 0: Yes.

704
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:09,909
Speaker 0: Prince of Nothing, it may not be the best, but it is the awesomest.

705
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:12,090
Speaker 1: It's just, there's something about it.

706
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,530
Speaker 0: It is the favorite of the front row crews.

707
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,309
Speaker 1: I mean, we're a group of geeks.

708
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,670
Speaker 1: We're really into fantasy stuff and sci fi stuff.

709
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,908
Speaker 1: And a lot of us read, you know, a lot of this stuff forever.

710
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:32,210
Speaker 1: And for some reason, the Prince of Nothing books, more so than anything other than, say, Tolkien, has just caused everyone to read the books in like repeating cycles.

711
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:38,149
Speaker 1: Every time someone gets into it again, it causes the whole conversation of, I can't even get into it.

712
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,188
Speaker 0: Hey, Rem, I just had an idea.

713
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:39,989
Speaker 1: What's your idea?

714
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,010
Speaker 0: What if the tusk is the heron spear?

715
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,589
Speaker 1: That is not, there is no way.

716
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,409
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, that could be pretty awesome, though.

717
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure the heron spear is some sort of laser artillery.

718
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:56,889
Speaker 0: I think you're crazy.

719
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:01,967
Speaker 1: Either that or it is a spear in the same way that the Spear of Longinus is technically a spear.

720
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,828
Speaker 0: That is what I think.

721
00:35:03,992 --> 00:35:07,330
Speaker 1: It is possible that the Prince of Nothing and Evangelion are, in fact, the same series.

722
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,590
Speaker 0: It's possible.

723
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,550
Speaker 1: Pretty much, that actually works really well.

724
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,289
Speaker 1: I said that.

725
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:13,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

726
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, you haven't read the fourth and fifth books.

727
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:16,869
Speaker 1: It really does.

728
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,809
Speaker 0: Maybe fourth and fifth, but not one, two, three.

729
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, read four and five.

730
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,767
Speaker 0: Except for the dad complex.

731
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:28,450
Speaker 0: I guess Nair is Kaji.

732
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,869
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, Nair.

733
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:31,550
Speaker 1: Nair is still my favorite.

734
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:32,589
Speaker 0: Really?

735
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:34,250
Speaker 1: I really like Nair.

736
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:37,790
Speaker 0: I think the most level-headed, intelligent person.

737
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:42,050
Speaker 1: Level-headed, intelligent is definitely Akamian and/or Zeswatha.

738
00:35:42,293 --> 00:35:42,729
Speaker 0: No, Zinnimus.

739
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,629
Speaker 1: Well, actually, Scott, level-headed, intelligent, Callus.

740
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,984
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, the most normal person is Zinnimus.

741
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,469
Speaker 1: I feel bad for Zinnimus, no.

742
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,490
Speaker 1: And Zeswatha gets a pretty good, I don't know, I feel like he is the right kind of badass.

743
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,847
Speaker 1: He's very Gandalfy.

744
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,690
Speaker 0: I think the best person is probably like, you know, Mathanet.

745
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,286
Speaker 0: He knows what's up.

746
00:36:05,214 --> 00:36:06,589
Speaker 1: You don't know, you know his full deal?

747
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:07,809
Speaker 0: I know enough deal.

748
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,368
Speaker 1: You don't know his full deal, I don't think.

749
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, Zeswatha is pretty good.

750
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, he knows what's up, because he doesn't shit.

751
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:15,788
Speaker 0: He doesn't need to.

752
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,570
Speaker 1: Actually, I have a newfound love for the oldest dragon.

753
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,410
Speaker 0: I don't know any dragons.

754
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:25,150
Speaker 1: The oldest dragon is both the oldest dragon and the oldest dragon.

755
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:25,810
Speaker 0: All right.

756
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, this weekend, Saturday is the Nerdnik, the Nerd NYC Nerdnik.

757
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,550
Speaker 1: We will be there nerding.

758
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:34,109
Speaker 0: It's in Central Park.

759
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:34,421
Speaker 0: Yep.

760
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:35,520
Speaker 0: Go to nerdnyc.com.

761
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:38,770
Speaker 1: You want to hang out with us, play some Jungle Speed on a rock?

762
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Friday the 13th, uh oh, is Nerd NYC Board Game Night.

763
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,510
Speaker 1: Yep, it's also Nerd Night, unrelated to Nerd NYC.

764
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't know which one we'll be at.

765
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,707
Speaker 1: We'll be at one of the two.

766
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:54,446
Speaker 0: Friday the 20th is, oh, I'm going to be at the library all night, but the 21st and 22nd is BarCamp NYC.

767
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,510
Speaker 0: So go sign up for BarCamp NYC if you're going to be in New York.

768
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:00,790
Speaker 0: And that's enough.

769
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.

770
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:13,630
Speaker 1: So way back when the Libya situation was still kind of in its early stages before we had decided to do airstrikes and all that stuff, I kind of idly said, yeah, we should do a show on that.

771
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,046
Speaker 1: We'll have the debate about whether or not...

772
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,850
Speaker 0: You always want to do shows on like world politics and shit.

773
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,290
Speaker 0: And I always say, no, that's not good for geek nights, but I will entertain you one time.

774
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,010
Speaker 1: No, Scott, I don't think it's, why is it not good for geek nights?

775
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,010
Speaker 1: Is political geekery any different from world wrestling geekery?

776
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:36,690
Speaker 0: We could discover, we can discuss political geekery in the meta as to talk about political geekery, but actually being political geekery.

777
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,023
Speaker 1: Why not?

778
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,990
Speaker 1: I mean, we can be wrestling geekery.

779
00:37:41,013 --> 00:37:45,850
Speaker 0: That is material for a show that specializes in politics.

780
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,926
Speaker 1: But why?

781
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,909
Speaker 1: Geek nights specializes in geekery.

782
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:57,730
Speaker 0: We could talk about, for example, model railroads in general, but we, you know, to be, we wouldn't be talking about like specific trains being better than other specific trains.

783
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,129
Speaker 1: Why not?

784
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,289
Speaker 1: It's all about the O gauge because we don't know shit about it.

785
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,350
Speaker 1: I used to have model trains.

786
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:02,629
Speaker 1: I was big into that when I was young.

787
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,545
Speaker 0: Yeah.

788
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:07,710
Speaker 0: So what's better, the Lionel or the, I don't even know any others.

789
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,930
Speaker 1: You realize there was a temporary line up.

790
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,508
Speaker 0: And that's why we don't talk about it because we're not...

791
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,990
Speaker 1: So get this, over, like right before Christmas, I was out with Emily.

792
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:16,849
Speaker 0: Talk about what you know.

793
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,170
Speaker 1: We were shopping for something, right?

794
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,870
Speaker 1: And you know what was in this empty space?

795
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,630
Speaker 1: Like there was a store that had been empty for a while, right across from Brian Park, a temporary Lionel store.

796
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,290
Speaker 1: All right.

797
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:26,861
Speaker 1: They had like...

798
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,727
Speaker 0: Holiday season?

799
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:29,150
Speaker 1: A holiday season.

800
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:29,530
Speaker 0: Of course.

801
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,450
Speaker 1: They had every train thing in there and they actually, they had the real stuff too.

802
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,330
Speaker 1: Not just the kiddie stuff.

803
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:33,830
Speaker 0: Of course.

804
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,770
Speaker 1: No one was buying the real stuff.

805
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:36,310
Speaker 0: No kidding.

806
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,730
Speaker 1: It was mostly people looking at the trains they already set up and no one was buying them.

807
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,140
Speaker 1: Really?

808
00:38:40,591 --> 00:38:41,048
Speaker 0: You don't say.

809
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,670
Speaker 0: I'm sure there were a few model railroad nerds who went in there to go get something that couldn't be gotten anywhere else.

810
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,470
Speaker 0: Like limited edition caboose or some shit like that.

811
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:55,270
Speaker 1: I mean, if you don't feel equipped to talk about world events as a geekery, I guess we could get a guest on like Scott Johnson or...

812
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:05,910
Speaker 0: You think Scott Johnson's... I mean, you know, Scott Johnson's more qualified than us, but he's still, you know, why don't we got to, if you want to get someone qualified, get someone who's like, you know, actually does it for a living.

813
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,490
Speaker 1: I mean, a lot of geeks are not qualified.

814
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,609
Speaker 1: Look at how many people are gamers, but suck at games.

815
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:13,269
Speaker 0: That's why they're not on podcasts like this one.

816
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,170
Speaker 1: Many of them are on podcasts.

817
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:22,910
Speaker 0: I only want to talk about something I'm qualified to talk about, such as anime, mangas, comics, video games, board games, RPGs and technology.

818
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:25,349
Speaker 1: So we're not qualified to talk about anything else?

819
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:26,929
Speaker 1: Not really, no.

820
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,820
Speaker 0: What else are you an expert at that?

821
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,090
Speaker 0: you're qualified to discuss?

822
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,068
Speaker 1: Financial stuff.

823
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,509
Speaker 0: It's because it's your job.

824
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,290
Speaker 1: I also studied certain areas of history pretty thoroughly.

825
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,370
Speaker 0: You're not an expert.

826
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:39,733
Speaker 1: No.

827
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:42,830
Speaker 1: So you're saying only experts who talk about anything?

828
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:44,529
Speaker 0: Only experts make a good podcast.

829
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:52,730
Speaker 0: I wouldn't I wouldn't listen to a podcast like, you know, 12 Byzantine emperors if the dude doing it wasn't an expert on Byzantine emperors.

830
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,050
Speaker 1: But he is just a high school teacher.

831
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:56,390
Speaker 0: The job doesn't matter.

832
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,410
Speaker 0: It's about the level of knowledge.

833
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,230
Speaker 0: I'm not in the game industry.

834
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:00,409
Speaker 1: How do you know he didn't just make it all up?

835
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,609
Speaker 1: Did you look at any sources?

836
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,390
Speaker 1: How do you know?

837
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,528
Speaker 1: Are you saying he made it all up?

838
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,388
Speaker 1: How do you know he didn't just make it all up?

839
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,189
Speaker 0: Because I was stupid and I trusted him.

840
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,870
Speaker 1: Do you even know there was a Byzantium?

841
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:10,583
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.

842
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,730
Speaker 1: Based on what?

843
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,230
Speaker 0: Because I went to the museum and saw Byzantine artifacts.

844
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,050
Speaker 1: Ah, but you're sure Byzantium isn't just like a town in Saudi Arabia?

845
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:20,228
Speaker 0: It's not.

846
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:29,630
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the whole point of this, that we were going to talk about Libya and have the debate, because there was a really interesting debate that I think is worthy of discussion, still not done in Libya.

847
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,950
Speaker 1: Whether or not assassination is a valid thing.

848
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,169
Speaker 0: Oh, we can we can discuss that.

849
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,630
Speaker 1: That's pretty much what we were going to talk about.

850
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:37,070
Speaker 1: All right.

851
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:44,510
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's so it so happens that we didn't get to do that show because we didn't do some Thursdays.

852
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:53,650
Speaker 1: And we had a canned Thursday we put up because the conventions and then fucking killed Osama bin Laden right before we were going to do this show.

853
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:59,250
Speaker 1: So I feel like we can roll all that into one because they're all just kind of similar.

854
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,268
Speaker 0: Exactly the same thing.

855
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,490
Speaker 1: Well, at least the assassination aspect of it is.

856
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,449
Speaker 0: That's the part that I was saying was exactly the same.

857
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:10,684
Speaker 1: It just made me feel really old to realize that a lot of kids don't.

858
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,110
Speaker 1: they weren't even alive 10 years ago.

859
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:14,116
Speaker 0: Yeah.

860
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,250
Speaker 0: You know, the last nine years worth of kids.

861
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:16,513
Speaker 0: Yeah.

862
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:17,629
Speaker 1: That's a lot of bags.

863
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:22,043
Speaker 0: A lot of kids who are, say, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, they were like three, one, two, three, four when it happened.

864
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,368
Speaker 0: So they don't remember shit.

865
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,417
Speaker 1: There was a pretty funny blog that posted.

866
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:30,162
Speaker 1: they said, like, do you really like?

867
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:33,310
Speaker 0: do you like, you know, you know about things like when Reagan was in Libya.

868
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,196
Speaker 0: But what were you one?

869
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:36,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't remember it.

870
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,350
Speaker 1: You just the earliest political things I remember.

871
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:40,609
Speaker 1: I remember the first Gulf War.

872
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:43,949
Speaker 1: I remember perestroika and glasnost and all that.

873
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

874
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:47,150
Speaker 1: And I remember the Cold War, kind of the end of that.

875
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,109
Speaker 1: We did nuclear drills in my elementary school.

876
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:51,643
Speaker 0: We didn't do that.

877
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:52,150
Speaker 1: We did that.

878
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,819
Speaker 1: It's kind of fucked up.

879
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:53,550
Speaker 0: We only had fire drills.

880
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,890
Speaker 1: It was the Catholic scary school.

881
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,450
Speaker 1: And we would do drills where we'd hide in the basement.

882
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:59,009
Speaker 0: And yeah, we didn't do that.

883
00:41:59,230 --> 00:41:59,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

884
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:02,681
Speaker 1: So, yeah, was was.

885
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:05,670
Speaker 1: were we legally justified in killing Osama bin Laden?

886
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:09,510
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you've got to first say, is it OK to kill anybody?

887
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,670
Speaker 1: Is it OK to kill anyone ever?

888
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:15,601
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, I mean, it's got death penalty, not it was not that long ago, years, some years ago.

889
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,410
Speaker 1: I remember you espousing to me that all forms of killing of any kind are unethical.

890
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:23,212
Speaker 0: They are.

891
00:42:23,815 --> 00:42:27,430
Speaker 1: So is there no situation where you wouldn't kill where you would kill another person?

892
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,969
Speaker 0: I would try very, very hard not to.

893
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,750
Speaker 1: But if so, say there's a track.

894
00:42:35,171 --> 00:42:41,450
Speaker 1: And if you pull the switch to some dudes and if you don't pull it, you're going to die.

895
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:46,150
Speaker 1: And there's no other option, no other option, pull the switch or you die.

896
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,326
Speaker 1: But if you pull the switch, some guy you don't know, but you can see dies.

897
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,453
Speaker 0: How is he?

898
00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:51,600
Speaker 0: how is he going to be killed?

899
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:53,010
Speaker 0: by what method?

900
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,190
Speaker 1: There is a train traveling at one thousand miles an hour.

901
00:42:56,471 --> 00:42:56,852
Speaker 0: All right.

902
00:42:57,254 --> 00:43:01,210
Speaker 1: And the switch directs it between the track you're tied to and the track he is tied to.

903
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,370
Speaker 0: I can't untie fast enough.

904
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,990
Speaker 1: The train is going a thousand miles an hour.

905
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,450
Speaker 1: You have literally enough time to pull the switch and nothing else.

906
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,488
Speaker 0: Who's who's the other guy?

907
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,455
Speaker 0: You don't know.

908
00:43:10,984 --> 00:43:11,350
Speaker 0: I don't see him.

909
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,690
Speaker 1: He's blonde, about five foot, eleven.

910
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,810
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about him.

911
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,072
Speaker 0: Nope.

912
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:17,168
Speaker 1: He's got blue eyes.

913
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,766
Speaker 0: Dude, who are you?

914
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:20,999
Speaker 1: You try to call out.

915
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:22,028
Speaker 1: You don't have enough time to call out.

916
00:43:22,592 --> 00:43:23,726
Speaker 1: OK, you've got one second.

917
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,949
Speaker 0: How did I get tied?

918
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:27,270
Speaker 0: Don't get tied in the first place.

919
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,489
Speaker 1: So a doctor came and offered you some pills.

920
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,470
Speaker 0: I started waving at the train to get it to stop at the brakes.

921
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,175
Speaker 1: Robot train.

922
00:43:35,803 --> 00:43:36,410
Speaker 0: Robot train.

923
00:43:37,655 --> 00:43:38,989
Speaker 0: I hack into the robot train.

924
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:39,752
Speaker 1: All right, fine.

925
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:44,870
Speaker 1: There is a guy with a gun pointed at you and kick him in the nuts.

926
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:48,590
Speaker 1: He is invincible, except for his nuts.

927
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:53,330
Speaker 1: If you say the word bananas, he will die of an aneurysm somehow.

928
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:55,410
Speaker 0: He's otherwise invincible.

929
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,069
Speaker 1: He's otherwise invincible and he's going to kill you.

930
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,710
Speaker 0: He's invincible, but that doesn't mean he is omnipotent.

931
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:02,920
Speaker 0: So I hit the gun.

932
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:03,850
Speaker 0: So it's out of the way.

933
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,669
Speaker 1: He's omnipotent unless you say bananas and kill him with an aneurysm.

934
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,395
Speaker 0: He's omnipotent.

935
00:44:08,435 --> 00:44:10,410
Speaker 0: So effectively, nothing I do matters.

936
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,730
Speaker 0: He could aneurysm himself with his own omnipotence.

937
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,750
Speaker 1: No, because once he dies, omnipotence ends because he's no longer potent or omni.

938
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:20,289
Speaker 0: Wait, but I can just walk around, right?

939
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,501
Speaker 1: Uh, you're locked in a 10 by 10 by 10 dungeon.

940
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:26,506
Speaker 0: Is anyone else around?

941
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:26,750
Speaker 0: Nope.

942
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,990
Speaker 1: Uh, but there's a camera to record everything.

943
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:32,630
Speaker 0: Oh, I say, hey, camera, what's up?

944
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,380
Speaker 1: There's no one watching.

945
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:33,990
Speaker 1: It's just recording.

946
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:35,349
Speaker 0: Oh, I try to reason with the guy.

947
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:36,990
Speaker 0: Hey, dude, why are you going to shoot me?

948
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:37,678
Speaker 1: He can't hear you.

949
00:44:38,084 --> 00:44:38,430
Speaker 0: Why not?

950
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,010
Speaker 1: He just can't sign language.

951
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:40,715
Speaker 1: Doesn't react.

952
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:42,330
Speaker 0: I give him the finger.

953
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:43,240
Speaker 1: He's grabbed your throat.

954
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:43,949
Speaker 1: He's choking you now.

955
00:44:44,493 --> 00:44:45,564
Speaker 0: Oh, he's not shooting me.

956
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:46,150
Speaker 1: He's choking you.

957
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,090
Speaker 0: I'm slowly dying.

958
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,532
Speaker 1: All right.

959
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:51,150
Speaker 1: You are literally one second from blacking out and dying.

960
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:51,999
Speaker 0: I try to take the gun.

961
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:52,810
Speaker 1: You fail.

962
00:44:53,612 --> 00:44:53,998
Speaker 0: I failed.

963
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:54,829
Speaker 1: You're dead.

964
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:55,853
Speaker 0: Sucks.

965
00:44:56,156 --> 00:44:57,850
Speaker 1: You would not have said bananas at any point.

966
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,550
Speaker 0: Uh, well, how would I have known to say banana?

967
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,190
Speaker 1: Someone told you all this ahead of time and demonstrated.

968
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,129
Speaker 0: Who told me ahead of time?

969
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:07,010
Speaker 1: The guy who put you in the dungeon.

970
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:07,990
Speaker 0: Who put me in the dungeon?

971
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,569
Speaker 0: How did I let myself get put in the dungeon?

972
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,510
Speaker 1: Another omnipotent guy who's not vulnerable to bananas.

973
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,608
Speaker 0: Why didn't he save me?

974
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:15,750
Speaker 1: Because he's evil.

975
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:17,766
Speaker 0: Evil.

976
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,990
Speaker 0: So there would be no point in even saying banana, because if I left, that guy could have killed me.

977
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,413
Speaker 0: Fine.

978
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,503
Speaker 1: So you're locked in a room.

979
00:45:23,664 --> 00:45:24,270
Speaker 1: You were kidnapped.

980
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,482
Speaker 1: Some guy just like sapped you.

981
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:26,009
Speaker 1: You wake up.

982
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:27,141
Speaker 1: There's you and another guy.

983
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:27,889
Speaker 1: There's a gun.

984
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,670
Speaker 1: And the guy says, I'm not opening the door until one of you is dead.

985
00:45:31,453 --> 00:45:32,970
Speaker 1: And the other guy says, I'm not going to die.

986
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:36,724
Speaker 0: Oh, I wouldn't shoot him.

987
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:37,330
Speaker 0: I would just wait.

988
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:38,053
Speaker 1: All right.

989
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,070
Speaker 1: You both die of starvation.

990
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:41,789
Speaker 1: Or he picks up the gun and he points it at you.

991
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:43,249
Speaker 1: Now what?

992
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:44,419
Speaker 0: No, that's all him.

993
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:45,330
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for rescue.

994
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,288
Speaker 1: So you're going to let him kill you?

995
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:48,969
Speaker 0: I'm going to die of starvation if I don't.

996
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:49,887
Speaker 1: You wouldn't kill him?

997
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:50,362
Speaker 1: No.

998
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:51,208
Speaker 1: No, why not?

999
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,356
Speaker 0: What do you mean why?

1000
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:53,290
Speaker 0: Because he might be rescued.

1001
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:54,830
Speaker 0: And then I would have killed him for no reason.

1002
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,630
Speaker 1: What if you know there's no chance of rescue?

1003
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:57,548
Speaker 0: I can't know that.

1004
00:45:58,413 --> 00:45:59,007
Speaker 0: How can I know that?

1005
00:46:00,013 --> 00:46:00,690
Speaker 1: Um, all right.

1006
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,922
Speaker 1: You're welded into a room.

1007
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:03,747
Speaker 0: And the welded.

1008
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,210
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm going to suffocate.

1009
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,248
Speaker 1: There's air being pumped in.

1010
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:08,189
Speaker 0: That means holes.

1011
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,010
Speaker 1: Through holes that are slightly larger than air molecules.

1012
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,750
Speaker 0: I'd make some situation like Shawshank Redemption.

1013
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:34,860
Speaker 1: See, frankly, there is almost no situation where if I had to choose between me dying and someone else dying, if the other person is going to be the cause of my death, it is highly unlikely that I would not kill them if that was the only option.

1014
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:35,759
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

1015
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:44,540
Speaker 0: But the point that I was trying to make with my stupidity there is that there is almost no real world situation where there is no chance.

1016
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,239
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the practical situations are more like, say for whatever reason, you have a gun.

1017
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,398
Speaker 0: Okay, why do I?

1018
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:51,900
Speaker 1: You carry a gun.

1019
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:52,600
Speaker 0: All right.

1020
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,900
Speaker 1: Like say I carry a gun for self-defense.

1021
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:54,418
Speaker 0: I wouldn't.

1022
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,799
Speaker 1: All right, say I do.

1023
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,297
Speaker 0: Okay.

1024
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:56,874
Speaker 1: I got a gun.

1025
00:46:58,724 --> 00:47:03,439
Speaker 1: And someone armed with a knife who is in close deadly range tries to assault me.

1026
00:47:04,085 --> 00:47:04,379
Speaker 1: Okay.

1027
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:09,399
Speaker 1: I would not feel any remorse, at least at the attempt of shooting them.

1028
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,459
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but you know what I would do is first I would threaten them with the gun, hoping that it would dissuade them.

1029
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:20,520
Speaker 0: And then I would of course, even if I had to shoot- If you say shoot to wound, that's crazy and stupid.

1030
00:47:20,661 --> 00:47:21,998
Speaker 0: If I was forced- 'Cause that doesn't work.

1031
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,020
Speaker 0: If I was forced to shoot them, right, I would attempt to not shoot them in the head.

1032
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,477
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

1033
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,460
Speaker 1: No, you don't shoot them in the head, you shoot them in center mass.

1034
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:31,300
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

1035
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,580
Speaker 1: And they're gonna die most likely.

1036
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,340
Speaker 0: But for example, right?

1037
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:38,560
Speaker 0: In fact, Scott, if you try- Let us go back to Bin Laden, right?

1038
00:47:39,363 --> 00:47:45,719
Speaker 0: I was reading, 'cause I read many accounts, as many people did, and who knows the veracity of these accounts, I don't know.

1039
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:58,040
Speaker 0: But many of the accounts that I read, at least three of them, all said that when they went to get Bin Laden, there was a woman there who they intentionally shot in the leg, intentionally.

1040
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,019
Speaker 0: And then they shot Bin Laden to kill him because he resisted.

1041
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,065
Speaker 0: But there was a woman.

1042
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:07,000
Speaker 0: they shot in the leg, on purpose, and succeeded in only wounding her, and they're Navy Seals.

1043
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:10,220
Speaker 0: So it's possible, if you're a bad-ass Navy Seal, to hit someone in the leg.

1044
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,620
Speaker 1: But Scott, they're not just Navy Seals, they're the special Navy Seals.

1045
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're the best Navy Seals.

1046
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,080
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, it's possible.

1047
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,420
Speaker 1: I mean, there is the conventional wisdom of shoot the hostage.

1048
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,136
Speaker 0: I have to try.

1049
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,040
Speaker 0: But if you- Even if my skill is nowhere near their skill.

1050
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:22,179
Speaker 1: See, I would not try.

1051
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:22,995
Speaker 0: I would try.

1052
00:48:23,302 --> 00:48:24,260
Speaker 1: I would shoot for center mass.

1053
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:24,818
Speaker 1: I would try.

1054
00:48:25,242 --> 00:48:26,619
Speaker 1: I would basically have no qualms.

1055
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,459
Speaker 0: I think I could hit someone in the thigh, I'm pretty good.

1056
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:29,538
Speaker 1: Are you?

1057
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:31,080
Speaker 1: What was the last time you fired a pistol?

1058
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,050
Speaker 0: The year 1990-.

1059
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:35,720
Speaker 1: That wasn't a 22-caliber pistol.

1060
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:36,540
Speaker 0: Never.

1061
00:48:38,842 --> 00:48:39,948
Speaker 0: But I fired, I used a 22 in like '96.

1062
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,778
Speaker 1: Pistol or rifle?

1063
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,500
Speaker 0: Both.

1064
00:48:46,562 --> 00:48:48,459
Speaker 0: It's really hard to hit things with a pistol from far away.

1065
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,380
Speaker 0: It's really hard to hit anything with a pistol.

1066
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:58,200
Speaker 0: But if a guy is close enough in knife range, but he's not close enough to actually stab yet- Actually, you're more likely to miss at that range, according to media accounts I read.

1067
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,459
Speaker 0: I didn't say he's at the knife range.

1068
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:05,974
Speaker 0: I said, if he's farther away, he can't stab you yet, but he also isn't 15 feet away.

1069
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,580
Speaker 1: People often greatly underestimate how deadly knives are at moderate range.

1070
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:12,700
Speaker 0: Ridiculously deadly.

1071
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,380
Speaker 1: Because pistols are inaccurate and difficult to fire at moving targets if you're not heavily trained.

1072
00:49:17,181 --> 00:49:19,960
Speaker 1: Basically, someone with a knife is very deadly, surprisingly far away.

1073
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I could also run if he's got a knife.

1074
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,358
Speaker 1: All right, got a gun now.

1075
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:26,619
Speaker 0: Now I can't run.

1076
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:28,699
Speaker 0: But now it's a wild west shootout.

1077
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,479
Speaker 0: So it's a wild west shootout.

1078
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,640
Speaker 1: I do not disagree that you try other options.

1079
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:34,460
Speaker 1: If they are available.

1080
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,560
Speaker 1: But in the real world, there's a lot of uncertainties.

1081
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,640
Speaker 1: There's no perfect, you must kill them no matter what, or you will die unless you're kidnapped by a sadist.

1082
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,240
Speaker 1: But at the same time, there's no guaranteed way to escape.

1083
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:54,880
Speaker 1: And if there's more than a tiny chance that I could die, I will probably opt for deadly force if that will greatly mitigate my chance of dying.

1084
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then again, right?

1085
00:49:56,461 --> 00:49:59,739
Speaker 0: So let's say you're locked in this crazy room and you're going to kill the other guy, right?

1086
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:01,080
Speaker 0: But they could just be lying.

1087
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:01,886
Speaker 0: You don't know.

1088
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:03,279
Speaker 0: that's actually going to get you out of there.

1089
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:07,640
Speaker 0: You know, it's only in the real world example, this guy's threatening you with death.

1090
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:11,779
Speaker 0: You know, there's so many options that you try before you try to kill him.

1091
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:14,538
Speaker 0: And even then, it's like, if you try to--.

1092
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:20,939
Speaker 1: But I'm saying if those options, in my personal case, would reduce my likelihood of survival, I will probably skip them.

1093
00:50:23,341 --> 00:50:25,620
Speaker 1: I mean, say someone breaks into a house that I was in.

1094
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,259
Speaker 1: I would use the Batman tactic first.

1095
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,859
Speaker 0: I try to hit, you know, I might try to club him over the head with a baseball bat from behind.

1096
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:33,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, talk to him from somewhere.

1097
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:34,379
Speaker 0: he can't see you.

1098
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got a Batman, that's the best way.

1099
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, you try a whole bunch of things.

1100
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,720
Speaker 1: So anyway, was the killing of Bin Laden justified?

1101
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,620
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know enough of the details to say for certain, but I can say the following things.

1102
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,380
Speaker 0: Number one is, you know, they talk about that he resisted.

1103
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,779
Speaker 0: Who knows how he resisted?

1104
00:50:52,981 --> 00:50:54,019
Speaker 0: I'm dubious of that.

1105
00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:00,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it says like, you know, even if he was armed, he didn't get a shot off, right?

1106
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,479
Speaker 0: And they shot this other woman in the leg.

1107
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,859
Speaker 0: They couldn't have shot Bin Laden in the leg too?

1108
00:51:05,641 --> 00:51:06,320
Speaker 0: He's an old man.

1109
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,418
Speaker 0: It's not like he would have gotten up.

1110
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:08,398
Speaker 0: What was he going to do?

1111
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,640
Speaker 0: He's an old man in the house, he can't do shit.

1112
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,500
Speaker 1: You know, it's possible.

1113
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:13,252
Speaker 1: They got, it's possible.

1114
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:15,999
Speaker 1: they tried to shoot him and they accidentally shot the hostage in the leg.

1115
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:18,060
Speaker 0: That is also possible.

1116
00:51:18,222 --> 00:51:18,838
Speaker 1: I mean, we don't know.

1117
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,560
Speaker 0: We have no idea.

1118
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:25,339
Speaker 1: The thing is, I saw a lot of people arguing that, you know, 'cause a lot of the pictures were leaked and I saw them.

1119
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:26,740
Speaker 0: And I don't know.

1120
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,320
Speaker 0: I've heard that every peak picture was fake and that no real pictures have been leaked.

1121
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,820
Speaker 0: It could have been Laden.

1122
00:51:31,602 --> 00:51:33,820
Speaker 1: What was leaked was a bunch of other pictures from the compound.

1123
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw pictures, the helicopters and beds.

1124
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,620
Speaker 1: And all the other people dead.

1125
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,032
Speaker 1: Kitchens.

1126
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,440
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of dead people.

1127
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:40,260
Speaker 0: I didn't see any dead people.

1128
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:41,679
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of stuff.

1129
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,779
Speaker 1: The argument a lot of people are making on the internet that is ludicrous is they're saying that, look, in all these pictures, there are no weapons.

1130
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,560
Speaker 1: None of these people were armed, clearly.

1131
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,719
Speaker 0: They took the weapons.

1132
00:51:53,220 --> 00:52:05,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, there are other explanations, but I think the simplest one is, if you just conducted a raid of a dangerous place with armed people, you don't just leave the weapons lying around for whoever might wander in to find them.

1133
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, and plus, you know, they had this super crazy helicopter of some origin.

1134
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,859
Speaker 1: Did you see the cool thing where they showed the picture of the helicopter and then they showed the picture when after, as they were leaving, they blew the helicopter up so no one could study it?

1135
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,899
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I think, but from what I've read from helicopter nerds, helicopter nerds are pretty sure that-

1136
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,380
Speaker 1: I was reading a lot about what helicopter nerds

1137
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:31,542
Speaker 0: that it is a modified Black Hawk helicopter and not some sort of secret helicopter that is stealth, but basically, it was a, they said it was like- Oh, yeah,

1138
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:34,016
Speaker 1: it's probably a custom helicopter using other

1139
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:34,220
Speaker 0: parts.

1140
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:40,978
Speaker 0: It was basically Black Hawk helicopter plus F-117, you know, body stuff that made it stealthy-ish.

1141
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:49,240
Speaker 1: Someone made a good argument that it was actually smaller than you would expect and it was kind of a specially designed, like miniature version of an old Comanche or something.

1142
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,940
Speaker 0: Who knows, but anyway, it was a cool helicopter.

1143
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,160
Speaker 1: I don't know, Aaron Clark, I know nothing more about helicopters.

1144
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should get Aaron Clark to ask about this helicopter, he knows.

1145
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Speaker 0: Anyway, they could have blown up all the weapons with the helicopter.

1146
00:53:01,022 --> 00:53:01,940
Speaker 0: That would have been very efficient.

1147
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:03,298
Speaker 1: I doubt they did that.

1148
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:04,199
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1149
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,794
Speaker 1: The weapon, someone finds an AK-47.

1150
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:11,195
Speaker 1: They've now found the technology to make more AK-47s.

1151
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,899
Speaker 0: I mean- No, but the point is you're gonna carry all those weapons back with you 'cause you don't have a helicopter to fly back in.

1152
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:22,280
Speaker 1: Well, you could turn them over to the clearly competent Pakistani military.

1153
00:53:23,582 --> 00:53:24,615
Speaker 0: Okay, sure, good idea.

1154
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:27,340
Speaker 0: They just hand them right back over, who knows?

1155
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:40,618
Speaker 0: The Daily Show had a good bit where they're basically like, not only was he hiding in a house- they probably, at least we have no idea 'cause we weren't there, but they probably could have just clubbed him over the head and taken him, probably pretty easily.

1156
00:53:41,283 --> 00:53:50,880
Speaker 1: I would argue from a foreign policy standpoint that as a politician, obviously not knowing any of the real intelligence, I mean, this is all speculation.

1157
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:53,700
Speaker 1: We don't know what the SEAL team actually was told.

1158
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,279
Speaker 1: We don't know what Obama and all them actually know.

1159
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,159
Speaker 1: For all we know, there's some crazy thing, like we have no idea.

1160
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:07,080
Speaker 1: But knowing what I do know, I would posit that there was no way you would want to actually bring him back alive.

1161
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:07,538
Speaker 0: Why not?

1162
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,499
Speaker 1: Because what would you gain?

1163
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,640
Speaker 1: The NIMBYs wouldn't let the trial happen anywhere.

1164
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,380
Speaker 0: Oh, you're saying what would the government gain?

1165
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:15,667
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1166
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:16,080
Speaker 0: Nothing.

1167
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,080
Speaker 0: The government would only hurt the government.

1168
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,719
Speaker 1: In fact, it would probably, if anything, there would almost definitely be attacks against wherever the trial was.

1169
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,700
Speaker 1: Wherever they put him would be attacked.

1170
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,860
Speaker 0: Well, there already was a trial.

1171
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,660
Speaker 0: He was already tried, so you could just put him straight in jail.

1172
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,639
Speaker 1: All right, so we put him in what jail?

1173
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:32,579
Speaker 0: The same place Bradley Manning is.

1174
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then what?

1175
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,900
Speaker 0: Bradley Manning gets off the hook, hopefully.

1176
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,440
Speaker 0: No, but anyway.

1177
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:46,579
Speaker 1: And also, it would give him a mouthpiece to speak, and we know, at least-- Ah, ah, but that is the thing.

1178
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:48,159
Speaker 0: What would the government gain?

1179
00:54:48,441 --> 00:54:55,140
Speaker 0: Nothing, but we, we would gain a great deal from all of the interviews with him, but it might harm the government.

1180
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:02,319
Speaker 0: And in fact, crazy conspiracy nuts might say, oh, and Bin Laden's gonna come out with, you know, they wanted to kill him 'cause they didn't want anyone to hear what he had to say.

1181
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, except we already know that we trained those assholes a long time ago.

1182
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:12,719
Speaker 0: I'm just saying is that, you know, the government did not have anything to gain, but the people did.

1183
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,980
Speaker 0: I think-- It would have been at the very least, right?

1184
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:26,100
Speaker 0: Even if it wouldn't have given us any useful information or anything of that nature, it would have been entertaining to see, you know, Bin Laden on 60 Minutes.

1185
00:55:26,302 --> 00:55:26,958
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.

1186
00:55:27,564 --> 00:55:37,260
Speaker 1: That would have been-- I can definitely go for that, but I think from a geopolitical stability standpoint, I think him being dead is probably more beneficial to the world overall.

1187
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:37,999
Speaker 0: It's also easier.

1188
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

1189
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,900
Speaker 0: But anyway, what I don't understand is why did they just like, it's like they took his body, they killed him, they took his body.

1190
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:47,979
Speaker 1: I read a lot of really good explanations about that, actually.

1191
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:48,740
Speaker 0: And they just buried him at sea?

1192
00:55:49,001 --> 00:56:01,259
Speaker 1: The argument was that one, there's apparently a thing in old scary Islam, like the, you know, old caliph days, about how the bot, like if his body was anywhere, it would be a shrine, and you don't want it, you know, wherever you bury it would cause trouble.

1193
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:03,156
Speaker 0: Well, someone can always go to the bottom of the sea and get it.

1194
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,980
Speaker 1: That's not likely.

1195
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:05,499
Speaker 1: Okay.

1196
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,399
Speaker 1: Where are they gonna find it?

1197
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,758
Speaker 0: The bottom of the sea.

1198
00:56:09,424 --> 00:56:10,018
Speaker 1: It's pretty deep.

1199
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,879
Speaker 0: There's a skeleton down there, 'cause the fish ate all the bits.

1200
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,339
Speaker 1: You don't know where it ended up.

1201
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,498
Speaker 1: You know, there's drift and stuff.

1202
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,939
Speaker 0: You could still use sonar and find it.

1203
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,218
Speaker 1: Probably not.

1204
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:20,316
Speaker 0: It's down there.

1205
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,820
Speaker 0: Plus, in the short term, it would bloat and float.

1206
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:26,859
Speaker 1: Uh, you realize burial at sea, they weigh 'em down.

1207
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:39,020
Speaker 1: Plus, not to sound like a conspiracy nut, I will bet you any money-- They didn't actually bury him at sea, and he's actually-- They didn't bury him at sea, but that was the excuse, and they're gonna keep the body for whatever.

1208
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,259
Speaker 0: No, because I'm pretty sure there were photos/videos of the sea burial.

1209
00:56:43,644 --> 00:56:45,959
Speaker 1: I don't think it would be that hard to cover that up.

1210
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,480
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not arguing that he's dead.

1211
00:56:47,903 --> 00:56:49,120
Speaker 0: I think they actually buried him at sea.

1212
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends.

1213
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,939
Speaker 1: In the very least, they probably kept fingers or some sort of, you know, teeth.

1214
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:54,533
Speaker 0: Hair.

1215
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure there are large core samples of Osama and Laden.

1216
00:57:01,201 --> 00:57:03,176
Speaker 0: I'm sure that, you know, they got what they need.

1217
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:04,359
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1218
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,860
Speaker 0: Photographically, physically, relics.

1219
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,136
Speaker 1: But I saw a lot of reasonable arguments as to why they did that.

1220
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:18,880
Speaker 1: I was more surprised by, well, not surprised by, but saddened by the immediate reaction of the crazies that say it's not really him, it's a conspiracy.

1221
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:20,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was really him.

1222
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:20,913
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1223
00:57:21,882 --> 00:57:22,819
Speaker 1: I'm confident it was him.

1224
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:24,922
Speaker 0: It was definitely him, 100%.

1225
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:26,820
Speaker 1: So, was killing him justified?

1226
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:37,879
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if you, you know, we don't know the details of the immediate, the immediate one, so we can't justify self-defense, 'cause we don't know.

1227
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,900
Speaker 0: Right, so if you're gonna do it based on death penalty, then I gotta say no, 'cause no death penalty.

1228
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,859
Speaker 0: But death penalty's no good.

1229
00:57:43,903 --> 00:57:47,640
Speaker 1: All right, now, you say no death penalty, and I also agree, no death penalty.

1230
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:47,928
Speaker 0: Yep.

1231
00:57:49,662 --> 00:58:00,300
Speaker 0: But-- But, I mean, if I was going to, if I was a cop going to arrest a guy who is, you know, a serial killer, like the guy who did the Long Island killings or something-- I believe the relevant quote is, oops.

1232
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:09,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he resisted, then, you know, I would personally try not to kill him, but I guess, you know, your job as a police officer is to kill him.

1233
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:13,216
Speaker 1: Well, my two arguments are, one, if there is no death penalty at all-- Yep.

1234
00:58:14,062 --> 00:58:19,420
Speaker 1: I bet you would see a lot more oopses when arresting particularly abhorrent criminals.

1235
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:20,156
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1236
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:21,498
Speaker 1: I guess, I don't know.

1237
00:58:21,903 --> 00:58:22,719
Speaker 1: That's a supposition.

1238
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:28,360
Speaker 1: Two, what about the geopolitical stability situation?

1239
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,138
Speaker 1: What about, I mean, look at after World War II.

1240
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:46,720
Speaker 1: The Nuremberg Trials, even if you disagree with the core fundamental ethics of the death penalty, I feel like that, those hangings were a very kind of important cathartic, like for the rest of society, the people who aren't able to just say-- Disgusting, vengeful people.

1241
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,540
Speaker 1: Not necessarily disgusting, vengeful.

1242
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,919
Speaker 0: I'm just saying people who-- Normal people happen to be disgusting and vengeful.

1243
00:58:52,281 --> 00:58:53,180
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say disgusting.

1244
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,619
Speaker 0: Just less disgusting than Nazis.

1245
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,960
Speaker 1: I wouldn't call it disgusting.

1246
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,240
Speaker 1: It just, that's how humans are.

1247
00:58:57,943 --> 00:58:59,080
Speaker 0: Yes, humans are disgusting.

1248
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:00,879
Speaker 1: It isn't even necessarily vengeance.

1249
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:11,680
Speaker 1: It's just some people have this weird need for closure or this sense of justice, that if someone has murdered so many, they feel like there needs to be some sort of final society.

1250
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:12,760
Speaker 0: It's called vengeance.

1251
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,240
Speaker 0: Revenge.

1252
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,580
Speaker 0: I think it's a little-- Someone hurt you, you hurt them back.

1253
00:59:16,722 --> 00:59:22,060
Speaker 1: I think it's a little more-- I think it's a little more nuanced than that, and I think you're really doing the argument of disservice.

1254
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,078
Speaker 0: You're making it too black and white.

1255
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,878
Speaker 0: So what is it?

1256
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,880
Speaker 1: As I was just saying-- You've done me wrong.

1257
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,579
Speaker 1: I do you wrong.

1258
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,278
Speaker 1: Eye for an eye.

1259
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,100
Speaker 1: I was saying it feels more like this sense of justice and closure.

1260
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:39,979
Speaker 1: People feel that that level of, some people think it's a deterrent effect, and while there's a lot of evidence that it isn't, in the very least, I can see why someone would believe that.

1261
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,660
Speaker 1: And two, some people might not necessarily want revenge.

1262
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:58,640
Speaker 1: They might feel bad about the killing of the person who committed horrible atrocities, but at the same time, they might feel a sort of sense of closure that society casts as judgment that some people are too violent to be allowed to live or too dangerous to be allowed to live.

1263
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, your emotions are not a good enough reason to kill a person.

1264
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:03,399
Speaker 0: Tough shit.

1265
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,339
Speaker 0: But Scott-- Emotions are not a good reason to do almost anything.

1266
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:12,559
Speaker 1: Scott, from a pragmatic standpoint, I feel like the Nuremberg trials did a lot of good for a lot of people to be able to move on.

1267
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,660
Speaker 1: And while you might say that's a failing of those people, that's fine, that's how people are.

1268
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,620
Speaker 1: You can't just ignore the fact that people are that way.

1269
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:22,033
Speaker 0: I can ignore people's feelings pretty easily 'cause I'm a huge jerk.

1270
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:32,720
Speaker 1: Well, humans can't ignore that and shouldn't because if you ignore that, you'll find that people will pretty much always disagree with you and side with the people who are more understanding.

1271
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, the vengeful, evil people disagree with me.

1272
01:00:35,821 --> 01:00:37,620
Speaker 0: Huh, that's a problem, I can give a shit.

1273
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:39,239
Speaker 1: Scott, you know who else disagrees with you?

1274
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:45,980
Speaker 1: The people who understand human nature and are willing to sometimes make sacrifices for the pragmatic good of the majority.

1275
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,739
Speaker 0: So there's people who are evil and vengeful and there's people who are willing to tolerate these evil and vengeful people.

1276
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,239
Speaker 0: And there's people like me, I'm not willing to tolerate these stupid people, fuck them.

1277
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

1278
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,039
Speaker 1: This is why no one ever agrees with you.

1279
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:57,503
Speaker 1: 'Cause they're

1280
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:18,260
Speaker 0: all shallow and disgusting vengeful human beings who can't rise above the base level of humanity and their simple human emotions and they can either A, want vengeance or B, are willing to accept that other people want vengeance and allow them that vengeance as opposed to using every inch of your will to fight against that disgusting human nature.

1281
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,419
Speaker 1: You're not using even a quarter of your will to fight against it.

1282
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,920
Speaker 1: Where are you protesting death penalties?

1283
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,240
Speaker 0: You don't see me killing anybody.

1284
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're not doing anything.

1285
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:26,598
Speaker 0: That's exactly right, you're not doing anything.

1286
01:01:26,982 --> 01:01:31,020
Speaker 1: Fairly poor arguments that appeal almost entirely to emotion and beg too many questions.

1287
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,260
Speaker 0: Appeal to no emotion?

1288
01:01:33,842 --> 01:01:34,960
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, anyway.

1289
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:36,500
Speaker 0: Is in fact the opposite of emotion.

1290
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,934
Speaker 0: So you should ignore your emotion.

1291
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:39,620
Speaker 0: that is evil.

1292
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:43,876
Speaker 1: See, when adults make decisions, they at least understand that.

1293
01:01:43,897 --> 01:01:52,940
Speaker 1: yes, even if people have failings, you have to understand and accommodate those failings while at the same time working toward a society that over time minimizes and eliminates those failings.

1294
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:56,340
Speaker 1: You wanna make a society where no one needs to see a Nuremberg trial.

1295
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:02,180
Speaker 0: If we have failings and we can see the failings, we know what the failings are, then that means we can not have them.

1296
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,240
Speaker 1: No, Scott, because the people who have them usually can't see them.

1297
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,280
Speaker 0: Tough shit for those people.

1298
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:14,459
Speaker 1: So this is why you'll never be in a position of power because the reality of the world is that there are people like that, what do you wanna do, just kill 'em all?

1299
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:15,837
Speaker 0: No, just ignore them.

1300
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:19,037
Speaker 1: But they're the majority and they control everything, so what do you do?

1301
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:20,960
Speaker 1: You already are complicit in all this.

1302
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,740
Speaker 0: See, you're asking me if I would kill Bin Laden if I feel as justified.

1303
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,459
Speaker 0: Those people certainly do, I do not.

1304
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:39,080
Speaker 1: I feel that from a political standpoint, killing Osama Bin Laden would have been justified for the symbolic value, but at the same time, I don't think it is in any way valuable from a pragmatic or practical value in terms of stopping terror.

1305
01:02:40,184 --> 01:02:41,600
Speaker 0: No, absolutely not, no way.

1306
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,420
Speaker 0: It doesn't stop any terror 'cause Bin Laden wasn't even really that good at being a terrorist.

1307
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,439
Speaker 0: He was really shitty at being a terrorist.

1308
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,719
Speaker 0: But anyway-- And he wasn't even doing any terror recently.

1309
01:02:51,040 --> 01:03:00,715
Speaker 1: So I guess I feel that on the death penalty, for situations like this, I feel like it's something that should be available and used so rarely that it's a big fucking deal when it is used.

1310
01:03:01,961 --> 01:03:05,679
Speaker 1: Pretty much war crimes, that's the only case of the death penalty in my mind.

1311
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:09,419
Speaker 1: Meh, that's your rebuttal?

1312
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:20,613
Speaker 0: I don't really, you know, like even when it comes to Nazis, right, it's like, you know, there's these people who are like Elie Wiesel, he's like still hunting down the Nazis who flew to South America, right?

1313
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:28,640
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, listen, the dude was a Nazi, he was an evil disgusting person, the worst kind of person that ever was lived.

1314
01:03:28,982 --> 01:03:40,320
Speaker 0: But it's like, what is there to gain by finding this person who's basically living alone, hidden away in South America, and dragging them, this like an 80 year old dude, somewhere to hang him?

1315
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,420
Speaker 0: What is the point of that?

1316
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,480
Speaker 1: I agree, I think it's stupid.

1317
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:43,060
Speaker 0: Like, I don't get it.

1318
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:44,320
Speaker 1: I don't think it serves any purpose.

1319
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,419
Speaker 1: It's just a few people wanting revenge for something that happened a long time ago.

1320
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:49,760
Speaker 0: So it's the same thing if it's immediate.

1321
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,560
Speaker 1: No, 'cause the immediate aftermath, there's a much greater effect.

1322
01:03:52,780 --> 01:04:02,179
Speaker 1: And I think the hangings, the Nuremberg hangings and the Nuremberg trials were a kind of accounting and reckoning that society, even though you disagree with it, I do think that--.

1323
01:04:02,543 --> 01:04:07,632
Speaker 0: So it's okay to do something evil because there's a bunch of evil people who don't think it's evil.

1324
01:04:07,653 --> 01:04:08,040
Speaker 1: Why is it evil?

1325
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:08,486
Speaker 1: What's evil?

1326
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:09,400
Speaker 0: You're killing somebody.

1327
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,280
Speaker 1: Why is that evil?

1328
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,260
Speaker 0: So is it okay to kill people?

1329
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:12,877
Speaker 1: Yes or no?

1330
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,340
Speaker 0: Period, just, is murder okay?

1331
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,380
Speaker 1: You know what I'm gonna say, Scott?

1332
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:17,645
Speaker 1: Sometimes.

1333
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:18,440
Speaker 0: Regardless of circumstance.

1334
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,127
Speaker 0: Sometimes.

1335
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:19,940
Speaker 0: You're gonna say sometimes?

1336
01:04:20,021 --> 01:04:20,378
Speaker 1: So yes.

1337
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,339
Speaker 0: So why, okay, so the sometimes yes and sometimes no, right?

1338
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,212
Speaker 0: In the sometimes no, why no?

1339
01:04:29,564 --> 01:04:30,400
Speaker 1: Depends on the circumstance.

1340
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:33,160
Speaker 1: I have very complex opinions on killing and the death penalty.

1341
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:37,200
Speaker 0: So every single circumstance is a different reason why killing is or is not okay?

1342
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,319
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't believe in moral absolutes.

1343
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,460
Speaker 0: All right, so if I were to stab you right now, that's not okay pretty much, right?

1344
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,960
Speaker 1: Well, because I have many arguments as to why I don't want you to stab me.

1345
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:47,900
Speaker 0: All right, fine, okay.

1346
01:04:47,900 --> 01:05:03,440
Speaker 1: The simplest one is that in lieu of all other things as a solipsistic being that appears to have free will and believes that it exists, I have no more deep or core purpose than to continue to exist because that's the only thing I can do truly.

1347
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:09,094
Speaker 1: So if you're going to do something that I believe may stop me from existing, there is no atrocity.

1348
01:05:09,135 --> 01:05:10,740
Speaker 1: I will not commit to keep myself existing.

1349
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,320
Speaker 0: All right, all right, let's make it a little easier, right?

1350
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,539
Speaker 0: So a stranger walks into the apartment and he knocks on the door, we let him in.

1351
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,899
Speaker 0: Let's say maybe it's a pizza delivery guy.

1352
01:05:17,124 --> 01:05:17,840
Speaker 0: A stranger.

1353
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,920
Speaker 0: And I stab the pizza delivery guy to death, right?

1354
01:05:21,263 --> 01:05:21,719
Speaker 0: Is that wrong?

1355
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,320
Speaker 1: - In my case, I would say yes because--.

1356
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:24,999
Speaker 0: - Why is it wrong?

1357
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:42,879
Speaker 1: - Because in my case, I do not see any imminent threat to you, nor any reason for the killing, nor any justifiability for the killing, and it looks like there's been material damage in a person, another being that theoretically has free will and is solipsistically self-referential and consistent has been ended.

1358
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:48,320
Speaker 0: - So why is it wrong to end a theoretically solipsistic being?

1359
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,699
Speaker 1: - It's not objectively wrong.

1360
01:05:50,941 --> 01:05:56,600
Speaker 1: I'm saying that I personally believe, my definition of wrong is that.

1361
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:00,080
Speaker 1: That is only my definition, and even then, it's only a projection.

1362
01:06:00,822 --> 01:06:02,080
Speaker 1: I'd want myself to continue.

1363
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:03,980
Speaker 1: I assume that person exists.

1364
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,920
Speaker 1: Therefore, I assume that they also would want to continue.

1365
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,900
Speaker 0: - So why do you care what the other person wants?

1366
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:31,218
Speaker 1: - On a core solipsistic level, I wouldn't, but because for various reasons, some of them are probably physiological, some of them are philosophical, none of them are absolute, I feel like two solipsistic beings that may or may not be able to interact and may or may not have free will is probably better overall than one.

1367
01:06:33,283 --> 01:06:37,000
Speaker 1: Because there is more chance of interaction, at least as far as I can perceive.

1368
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,231
Speaker 0: - So it's all based on interaction, right?

1369
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,320
Speaker 1: - Well, no, that's just in this case.

1370
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,060
Speaker 0: - So you value more interaction over less interaction.

1371
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,800
Speaker 1: So therefore-- - Not at all scales, though.

1372
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:48,793
Speaker 0: - Uh-huh.

1373
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,859
Speaker 1: So therefore-- - Scott, I think the problem is you're trying to trap me in a moral absolut--.

1374
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,360
Speaker 0: - I'm not trying to trap you, I'm just trying to ask.

1375
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:01,900
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but I'm just saying there are no moral absolutes, and if you want to argue pure philosophy, it'll all come back down to solipsism,

1376
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:14,920
Speaker 0: - Of course everything comes down to solipsism, but it's basically, you have a totally subjective moral, which is all morals are, that killing is wrong, and the question is just why is that your moral?

1377
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,640
Speaker 0: Why have you personally chosen that moral?

1378
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:21,798
Speaker 1: - If you wanted the simple answer, in general, I prefer to see people smile than frown.

1379
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:24,260
Speaker 1: I prefer to generally see people happy.

1380
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,360
Speaker 0: - So is it a selfish moral?

1381
01:07:27,262 --> 01:07:32,880
Speaker 0: You do not want killing because a world with less killing makes you personally happier 'cause that world has more people in it.

1382
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:43,400
Speaker 1: - But I believe, though I cannot prove, that it makes other people happier too, and I personally, for reasons that I may not be able to fully explain, feel happier when I see other people happy.

1383
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,540
Speaker 0: - And that is why that you think it is okay to kill bin Laden because you see that making other people happy.

1384
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,020
Speaker 1: - Ah, but at the same time, that alone wouldn't justify it in this case.

1385
01:07:54,261 --> 01:08:02,059
Speaker 1: You want, here, my pragmatic argument for killing Osama bin Laden, as opposed to the philosophical one, because that gets boring really quickly.

1386
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:17,459
Speaker 1: Pragmatically, it prevents him from having a mouthpiece, which it also prevents him being a focus for terror, because we know that, by and large, terror committed, especially against the West, is not by some large, shadowy organization that has a command and control structure.

1387
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,778
Speaker 1: It seems to be by-- - Random angry dudes.

1388
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,700
Speaker 1: - Or small cells that coordinate in a very loose fashion.

1389
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:41,959
Speaker 1: So as a result, the best way to prevent terror is to prevent a focus for that terror, kind of like how if you put an object into, like you can basically, by disturbing water that has something dissolved in it, you can sometimes cause that something to precipitate out around the focus.

1390
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:42,738
Speaker 1: - That's true.

1391
01:08:42,939 --> 01:08:47,167
Speaker 1: - Like when you have super-heated water that's been boiled twice, and it's fine, it just sits there.

1392
01:08:47,187 --> 01:08:47,899
Speaker 0: - You get a bunch of calcium.

1393
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,135
Speaker 1: - But then you poke a stick into it, or a spoon, and it explodes suddenly.

1394
01:08:52,154 --> 01:08:52,580
Speaker 0: - And it explodes, yep.

1395
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,859
Speaker 1: - The focus, you gave something for the hate and the terror to precipitate around.

1396
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:06,479
Speaker 1: Bin Laden being alive, there is no practical way to do anything with him but kill him, and even killing him after the fact would have been a focal point for terror.

1397
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:13,920
Speaker 1: The fact that by the time the news came out, he was already dead, blunted that blow, I think, from a very pragmatic and practical perspective.

1398
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:28,439
Speaker 0: - It also, right, people don't think about this, it actually decreases terror in the opposite direction, right, because it's sort of like we were on the warpath to hunt the guy down, and now that we got him, the warpath of the U.S.

1399
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:31,359
Speaker 0: It's like, we're not on the warpath anymore, as much.

1400
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,279
Speaker 1: - At least we shouldn't be on the warpath.

1401
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,734
Speaker 1: The TSA, I really hate the fucking TSA.

1402
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:41,880
Speaker 0: - Well, I mean, we're still on the warpath, many warpaths around the world, but there is one, at least the warpath has diminished a tiny bit.

1403
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,071
Speaker 0: - The TSA tweeted.

1404
01:09:43,091 --> 01:09:46,740
Speaker 0: - And reverted from, we took some offense and moved it to defense.

1405
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:54,059
Speaker 1: - Yep, the TSA tweeted something to the effect of, he may be dead, but we're gonna stick around like terror is still a danger.

1406
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:55,810
Speaker 0: - Okay.

1407
01:09:55,831 --> 01:09:56,199
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

1408
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:01,059
Speaker 1: - I was kinda, I feel like, okay, we got him, can we repeal the Patriot Act now?

1409
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,296
Speaker 0: - Terror wasn't a danger before.

1410
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,079
Speaker 1: - So get this, the Patriot Act actually expires at the end of the month and has to be renewed again.

1411
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,360
Speaker 0: - I thought it got renewed.

1412
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,540
Speaker 1: - I don't know if it actually got renewed, I didn't follow up after that.

1413
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:13,600
Speaker 0: - I don't know, I remember there was people asking me to sign digital petitions to make it not be renewed.

1414
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,672
Speaker 0: - It's been renewed before.

1415
01:10:14,692 --> 01:10:15,400
Speaker 0: - I know.

1416
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,820
Speaker 1: - But it needs to be renewed periodically.

1417
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,360
Speaker 0: - Hopefully it won't be renewed.

1418
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,319
Speaker 1: - I think it will be, though.

1419
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,120
Speaker 0: - Probably.

1420
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:22,160
Speaker 0: Maybe they can renew it with an amendment.

1421
01:10:23,723 --> 01:10:27,099
Speaker 0: That'd be at least a little bit better, as long as it's not a bad amendment, it can make it worse.

1422
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,299
Speaker 0: It can always happen, fuckers.

1423
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:42,000
Speaker 1: - So two practical reasons, if you ignore the morals of killing someone, these were two practical, greater good reasons for killing him in the manner that we did, as opposed to trying to bring him back alive.

1424
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:55,180
Speaker 1: - Yep, well I, right-- - Poorly we can disagree on that, but at least we should agree that irrespective of our personal beliefs and irrespective of-- - Well, if I was the government and I had the motivations of the government, then practically, absolutely yes.

1425
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,180
Speaker 1: - Yep, and it just so happens that my-- - If I was the government.

1426
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,600
Speaker 1: - My personal motivations-- - But I'm not the government.

1427
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,400
Speaker 1: - In this case, generally aligned with what the government did.

1428
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,040
Speaker 0: - Nah, see, but practically, right, personally, right, me not being the government, I don't want that.

1429
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:07,080
Speaker 0: I wanted to have a mouthpiece.

1430
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,639
Speaker 0: I wanna hear all sorts of crazy stuff.

1431
01:11:09,123 --> 01:11:10,420
Speaker 0: I wanna see all sorts of drama.

1432
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:19,940
Speaker 0: I wanna see all those people who want him to be killed, all those vengeful people that I don't like, I wanna see them upset, 'cause I get some schadenfreude on those evil people who want vengeance all the time.

1433
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:21,599
Speaker 0: That would be awesome-- - Why would they be upset?

1434
01:11:21,701 --> 01:11:23,600
Speaker 1: He probably would have been tried and then executed.

1435
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,440
Speaker 0: - No, but see, that's why I wanted to see him not be executed, so those people would be upset.

1436
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,580
Speaker 1: - But he probably would have been.

1437
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:38,460
Speaker 0: - That's just what I know, but that's just what I personally wanted, you know, for the awesomeness of me being like, aha, you evil people didn't get what you wanted, you assholes, always looking for killing people.

1438
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,260
Speaker 1: - I mean, I know I saw a lot of people celebrating-- - And I would've loved to see him on TV, - Like, I saw a lot of people just celebrating like crazy.

1439
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:45,960
Speaker 0: - Not because I--.

1440
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:49,459
Speaker 1: - Then I said it happened, but I remember I saw the news, 'cause, you know, people were over it.

1441
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,879
Speaker 1: I look out at Fark, and Fark had it way before the real news, dude.

1442
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:59,256
Speaker 1: - Well, of course, and I don't wanna-- all I thought was, huh, and I remember I was like, "Hey, Emily, Osama's dead," and she's like, "Oh,

1443
01:11:59,437 --> 01:11:59,618
Speaker 1: okay.".

1444
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,840
Speaker 0: - Yeah, whatever.

1445
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,679
Speaker 1: - We were like, hm, and then we went to bed.

1446
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:08,799
Speaker 0: - Well, I mean, but even before he got killed, you know, we didn't even know if he was dead or alive, and we didn't really care.

1447
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,300
Speaker 0: It was like, you know, there was all sorts of rumors.

1448
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,756
Speaker 0: He's in a cave, he's serious there.

1449
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,220
Speaker 1: - Here's a practical question.

1450
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,560
Speaker 1: Suppose Al-Qaeda had been real.

1451
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:20,239
Speaker 1: It really was an organization, and he really was controlling it.

1452
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,092
Speaker 0: - So there really was basically Dr.

1453
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:27,659
Speaker 0: Evil Incorporated, and he was really the big boss, and they were really, and they were confident and good at what they did.

1454
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:37,480
Speaker 1: - Yes, so supposing that was, would then assassination if it were viable, and if we believe that it would disrupt the operations of this organization be justified?

1455
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,860
Speaker 0: - Mm, that is a difficult question.

1456
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,120
Speaker 1: - Philosophically or practically?

1457
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:47,360
Speaker 0: - That is a difficult, well, first of all, if they were an organized organization, right, with structures and command and control.

1458
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,420
Speaker 1: - We could argue that they're an army at war?

1459
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,680
Speaker 0: - We could, no, we could just fight them in open war, right?

1460
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,397
Speaker 0: Just straight up, you know, you roll tanks, roll.

1461
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:55,478
Speaker 1: - We are.

1462
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,376
Speaker 0: - In the advanced wars.

1463
01:12:56,740 --> 01:13:00,778
Speaker 1: - But God, in Pakistan, Afghanistan, we have drones just flying out, shooting people all the time.

1464
01:13:01,721 --> 01:13:03,380
Speaker 1: We are actively at war with these elements.

1465
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:10,159
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but it's not, it's not like a one army, or, you know, a bunch of henchmen all wearing the same helmet.

1466
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,420
Speaker 0: It's, you know, it's random dude here, random dude there.

1467
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:17,400
Speaker 0: That would be like, you know, it's basically, it's like criminals all over the place.

1468
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,060
Speaker 0: You wouldn't use drones to kill, like, all the murderers in New York City.

1469
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:21,940
Speaker 1: - No, use Batman.

1470
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,419
Speaker 0: - That's what I'm saying, right?

1471
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,480
Speaker 0: It's a Batman situation, not a drone situation.

1472
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:32,360
Speaker 0: But if it was an evil organization, and they had like a secret base, drones are the, totally appropriate.

1473
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,938
Speaker 1: - So, I guess, 'cause I wanna dovetail this into Libya a little bit.

1474
01:13:38,242 --> 01:13:43,799
Speaker 1: Do you think assassination at all, forget the legality of it as we currently portray it?

1475
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,259
Speaker 0: - Yeah, legality, all the answers of the questions of legality are just known, and there's no disagreement on them, really.

1476
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:49,920
Speaker 0: So what's the point?

1477
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,640
Speaker 1: - Is assassination ever pragmatically justified?

1478
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:54,358
Speaker 0: - Pragmatically justified?

1479
01:13:56,022 --> 01:13:57,180
Speaker 0: It's tough, right?

1480
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:01,600
Speaker 0: 'Cause I mean, if you're, the motivations of a government, right?

1481
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:08,320
Speaker 0: It's like, well, if you're a world leader and you order to assassinate another world leader, suddenly your ass is grass, right?

1482
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,219
Speaker 0: 'Cause now it's open season on world leaders.

1483
01:14:10,582 --> 01:14:17,500
Speaker 0: So world leaders really like there not to be any assassinations, 'cause then they don't have to worry as much, even though they worry a whole lot.

1484
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:23,600
Speaker 0: Obama drove by the office this morning, and he looked pretty worried with his motorcade and blocking off the road.

1485
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:25,840
Speaker 1: - Thing is, motorcade is always that way.

1486
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:33,100
Speaker 0: - I know, but I'm just saying, it's like, they're still pretty worried about assassination, even when there's no assassinations, right?

1487
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,452
Speaker 1: - Right, and we tried to assassinate Castro.

1488
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:36,399
Speaker 1: how many times?

1489
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,919
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know, we did.

1490
01:14:38,262 --> 01:14:48,599
Speaker 1: I guess the only argument I have is that regardless of the realities of whether or not it's possible to assassinate people, because it's really hard to assassinate people, as we learned when we tried to get Castro.

1491
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,480
Speaker 0: - Well, we've tried to assassinate a lot of people.

1492
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:51,354
Speaker 0: It's really hard.

1493
01:14:51,374 --> 01:14:51,639
Speaker 0: - Yep.

1494
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,099
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on the person.

1495
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,519
Speaker 0: - Especially if they're guarded at all.

1496
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,699
Speaker 0: Saddam Hussein's doubles, I mean, come on.

1497
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,060
Speaker 0: Couldn't even get him with briefcase bombs and shit.

1498
01:14:59,140 --> 01:14:59,463
Speaker 0: Doesn't work.

1499
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:01,320
Speaker 1: - Yep, the Ikurai dynasty.

1500
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:03,928
Speaker 0: - But anyway.

1501
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:06,160
Speaker 1: - God, that was one of the best scenes in The Prince of Nothing.

1502
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:06,986
Speaker 0: - That's a good scene.

1503
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:08,240
Speaker 1: - When he replaced the guard.

1504
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:15,680
Speaker 0: - But, you know, so from that perspective, pragmatically, assassinating is not good if you're a world leader, 'cause then suddenly you're on the line, right?

1505
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:22,760
Speaker 0: But, and also, right, if you assassinate a world leader, you might create more disruption, right?

1506
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:27,552
Speaker 0: 'Cause now there'll be a struggle for power, and the person that you wanna be in power might not come to power.

1507
01:15:27,572 --> 01:15:27,673
Speaker 0: - But!

1508
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,920
Speaker 0: - It could actually make a bad situation worse.

1509
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:35,020
Speaker 0: - But at the same time-- - There are times when it could make a bad situation better.

1510
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,060
Speaker 1: - I think a good example of that would be North Korea.

1511
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:42,754
Speaker 1: Kim Jong-il is clearly not actually in charge, because he is crazy.

1512
01:15:42,775 --> 01:15:43,179
Speaker 1: - No, no.

1513
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,020
Speaker 1: - Killing him would disrupt everything.

1514
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,233
Speaker 0: - Maybe, you'd have to kill a bunch of other guys too, but not too many guys.

1515
01:15:51,253 --> 01:15:56,260
Speaker 1: - You're better off letting him die of old age and letting them disrupt themselves than having an external disruption.

1516
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,198
Speaker 0: - But you could speed it up.

1517
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,320
Speaker 0: It's like you could save them sooner, you know?

1518
01:15:59,420 --> 01:15:59,977
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't you?

1519
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:07,379
Speaker 0: If all the assassinating him now does is make the good stuff, or hopefully good stuff, happen sooner, then why wouldn't, you know?

1520
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:08,934
Speaker 1: - 'Cause it might not.

1521
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:09,340
Speaker 0: - That's true.

1522
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,910
Speaker 0: - But in the case of Libya-- - I'm assuming you know it would make it better.

1523
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:18,860
Speaker 1: - That's more of a case where, I mean, basically, we have one man who is kind of a demigod.

1524
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:24,399
Speaker 1: He has personal, charismatic power over the elements of the military that are loyal to him.

1525
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:29,739
Speaker 1: And the elite, at least, are loyal to him as well, because he keeps them in the goods.

1526
01:16:30,522 --> 01:16:40,419
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I do not believe that if he suddenly died, that the rest of the power structure around him could continue much longer.

1527
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,500
Speaker 0: - Well, what you want is you want a situation where all those elite guys and military leaders, right?

1528
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,086
Speaker 1: - Turn on him.

1529
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:46,939
Speaker 0: - Well, no.

1530
01:16:47,884 --> 01:16:48,899
Speaker 0: Well, they could turn on him, yeah.

1531
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:56,999
Speaker 0: But it's like, if he's assassinated, there's a few ways it can go, but one of the ways it can go is they get really mad, and then you made it worse.

1532
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:05,279
Speaker 0: - But considering that his army is a lot of mercenaries-- - Another way it could go is that they flee, and that's a good way for it to go, is if they're like, "Oh, shit," and they get out.

1533
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:21,020
Speaker 1: - The best way, from a stability standpoint, even though it's not the best in the short term for the regular people, is if the elite, realizing that it's all gonna fall apart, he dies, let's say, and they publicly side with the rebels and say, "Yes, we will form a new government.

1534
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:24,280
Speaker 1: "It's over, hooray," and they don't actually change anything.

1535
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:33,287
Speaker 0: - All right, well, let's go back historically, or let's think of some people that were famous, right, and would assassinating them have been-- - Hitler, Hitler.

1536
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:33,838
Speaker 0: - You think so.

1537
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,860
Speaker 1: - Would Hitler, is assassinating Hitler early enough?

1538
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,660
Speaker 0: - It depends when you assassinate him.

1539
01:17:41,081 --> 01:17:45,380
Speaker 0: If you assassinate him very early, no bad ever, well, a lot less bad ever happens.

1540
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,419
Speaker 0: Nazis never take power or whatever, right?

1541
01:17:47,842 --> 01:17:48,515
Speaker 0: And that's a great move.

1542
01:17:48,536 --> 01:17:48,760
Speaker 0: - Maybe not.

1543
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,779
Speaker 1: I mean, it's possible someone else in his organization would've kept up the good fight.

1544
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,180
Speaker 0: - Possible, possible, but it would've been different.

1545
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,389
Speaker 1: - In fact, someone less crazy might've actually managed the war more competently toward the end.

1546
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:04,600
Speaker 0: - But if you kill him in art school, right, but there's no way you could've had that foresight to do that, but I'm just saying, time machine, right?

1547
01:18:05,464 --> 01:18:12,239
Speaker 0: That would've been a great move, but if you assassinate him in the middle of the war, that actually may have been a bad move.

1548
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:15,431
Speaker 1: - Well, especially because he was largely incompetent toward the end of the war.

1549
01:18:15,451 --> 01:18:20,099
Speaker 0: - That's what I'm saying, is if you killed him before the end of the war, would they have pressed to the east?

1550
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:27,620
Speaker 0: Maybe not, and then they might've been more successful, so maybe a bad move at that point, practically speaking.

1551
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,880
Speaker 1: - Yep, it depends on when, though.

1552
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:29,803
Speaker 1: Maybe in 1941.

1553
01:18:29,803 --> 01:18:32,878
Speaker 1: - Yeah, maybe, it depends.

1554
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,420
Speaker 0: It's all timing, a lot of timing issues, right?

1555
01:18:36,681 --> 01:18:40,840
Speaker 0: And then, okay, so what about, you know, there's another one where it's like definitely good move.

1556
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,089
Speaker 0: Pol Pot, any time.

1557
01:18:42,109 --> 01:18:47,160
Speaker 1: - At the same time, Pol Pot, what was going on, I feel like the whole movement would've continued.

1558
01:18:48,743 --> 01:18:50,540
Speaker 1: Him dying would not have affected the movement.

1559
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:51,528
Speaker 0: - I think it would've.

1560
01:18:51,548 --> 01:18:52,820
Speaker 1: - What about Chairman Mao?

1561
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,420
Speaker 0: - Chairman Mao wasn't really as bad as those other guys.

1562
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:00,620
Speaker 1: - Exactly, I want a much more morally ambiguous situation.

1563
01:19:01,524 --> 01:19:02,009
Speaker 1: - So.

1564
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,100
Speaker 1: - I mean, Stalin.

1565
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:06,230
Speaker 0: - And I mean, it's not like Chiang Kai-Shek was an angel, either.

1566
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:09,720
Speaker 1: - No, but I'm pretty sure if Stalin had been assassinated once he really--.

1567
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,500
Speaker 0: - Oh, Stalin, you can kill Stalin any time you want.

1568
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:17,320
Speaker 1: - I'm pretty sure there is nobody in the power structure who would've taken over, who would've been as crazy as he was.

1569
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,000
Speaker 0: - No, you could kill Stalin any time you want.

1570
01:19:19,342 --> 01:19:20,680
Speaker 0: When he's zero, sure, go for it.

1571
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,067
Speaker 1: - Saddam Hussein would've been a clusterfuck had he died.

1572
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:25,559
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know, I don't know about him, either.

1573
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:28,937
Speaker 0: But I mean, there's also-- - What kind

1574
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:31,886
Speaker 1: of fucked up world is this, where, and Emily and I were talking about this the other day,

1575
01:19:32,532 --> 01:19:32,874
Speaker 0: because

1576
01:19:32,915 --> 01:19:40,999
Speaker 1: of the way we did everything, we live in a world where I look at people like Bill O'Reilly and say, wow, you're one of the more reasonable people on that side.

1577
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:46,820
Speaker 1: And I look at someone like Saddam Hussein and say, you know what, you're a real bad dude, but I kinda feel sorry for the way you ended.

1578
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:55,559
Speaker 1: The fact that I felt sympathy for Saddam Hussein really makes me uncomfortable with the way our foreign policy has worked out the last several years.

1579
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,080
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know, that's what happens.

1580
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,979
Speaker 1: - Like, you know, you were a bad guy, but there were worse.

1581
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:08,080
Speaker 0: - There were, yeah, that's the thing with bin Laden is everyone's acting, that's the one thing that upsets me the most, is everyone acts like bin Laden.

1582
01:20:08,443 --> 01:20:10,760
Speaker 0: was this big, big dangerous bad guy, right?

1583
01:20:11,062 --> 01:20:16,080
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, right, the first thing is that he was a bad guy, real bad, right?

1584
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,059
Speaker 1: But-- - He was dangerous, too.

1585
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:18,759
Speaker 1: He had the money.

1586
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:26,699
Speaker 0: - He was dangerous, and that he provided resources to many dangerous people, helped them out, gave them training and such and such.

1587
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,220
Speaker 0: Clearly bad, clearly dangerous, clearly a threat, no question, right?

1588
01:20:31,622 --> 01:20:38,780
Speaker 0: He was also responsible for many bad things, definitely, such as embassy bombings in Africa, et cetera, et cetera.

1589
01:20:39,762 --> 01:20:40,629
Speaker 0: Bombing in the U.S.S.

1590
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,100
Speaker 0: called, directly responsible.

1591
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:46,900
Speaker 1: - To get rid of him and his little organization, and yet, Rwanda.

1592
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,540
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there are many places where much worse things are happening.

1593
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,799
Speaker 1: - Right now, they're still happening.

1594
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,470
Speaker 1: - Syria?

1595
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:54,940
Speaker 1: - Yep.

1596
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,220
Speaker 1: Of course, there's little we can do about Syria.

1597
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:57,763
Speaker 1: - Bahrain?

1598
01:20:57,784 --> 01:20:58,660
Speaker 1: - We can't really invade.

1599
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,003
Speaker 1: Actually, you know, to get into Libya, this is, I mean-- - Libya?

1600
01:21:03,023 --> 01:21:09,918
Speaker 1: - Gaddafi, whether or not we want to assassinate him, the reality is we probably couldn't easily do it.

1601
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,500
Speaker 0: - Well, first of all, he's probably in a more secure place than bin Laden.

1602
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:22,219
Speaker 1: - Well, especially now that we killed his son, which sadly, I read that the one that died was the most liberal and most progressive of his entire family who was in the country.

1603
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,298
Speaker 0: - Then why did they kill him?

1604
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,688
Speaker 0: Wouldn't they have known that that was the good one and not gone after him?

1605
01:21:25,709 --> 01:21:27,879
Speaker 1: - I think they just bombed a building that they knew someone was in.

1606
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,117
Speaker 1: They didn't know who it was, I don't know.

1607
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,880
Speaker 0: - Oh, so they can just indiscriminately bomb those buildings.

1608
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,960
Speaker 1: - Well, the thing is though, Libya and Syria, 'cause he brought up Syria, are very different situations.

1609
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:45,880
Speaker 1: Libya, because it was a rebellion, there are cities that are straight up, this is a rebel city, there are clearly demarcated forces.

1610
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,060
Speaker 1: - Well, Libya's very large geographically.

1611
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:58,540
Speaker 1: - But as a result, it's very easy, if we want to intervene, to intervene by literally attacking military assets with relatively little chance of collateral damage.

1612
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:04,229
Speaker 1: Syria is a lot more plainclothes policemen in cities attacking people.

1613
01:22:04,249 --> 01:22:06,595
Speaker 0: - It's also much smaller geographically.

1614
01:22:06,616 --> 01:22:06,738
Speaker 1: - Yep.

1615
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:14,560
Speaker 1: But it's not like, oh, we can bomb all those people to slow down the hostilities, because those people are mixed in with the people we're trying to protect.

1616
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:22,098
Speaker 0: - Well, I think a lot of that is just a side effect to the fact that the US, we really don't want to see any US people being killed, right?

1617
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:26,319
Speaker 0: So we won't send in a giant army of a million soldiers and tanks.

1618
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,750
Speaker 0: - Well, Libya, too-- - It's always bombs and missiles and boats.

1619
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:33,772
Speaker 1: - Is definitely more of a NATO initiative, and really, France and a lot of other countries.

1620
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:35,588
Speaker 0: - NATO, which is what, percent US forces?

1621
01:22:35,608 --> 01:22:38,900
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but at the same time, they were pushing for it much more than we were.

1622
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,459
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's 'cause they're close.

1623
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:44,797
Speaker 1: - Also because-- - And Libya doesn't affect us as much as other things.

1624
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:47,306
Speaker 1: - Yeah, also because there's a long-- - I mean, it affects us certainly, clearly.

1625
01:22:47,326 --> 01:22:55,166
Speaker 1: - I realized recently that many of our listeners probably actually have no idea what the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing was all about or even know what that is.

1626
01:22:55,186 --> 01:23:00,520
Speaker 0: - I just discussed it earlier and how we were basically zero when that happened, right?

1627
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,227
Speaker 1: I knew about it, and-- - Yeah, but we don't remember it.

1628
01:23:03,247 --> 01:23:04,732
Speaker 1: - A lot of, yeah, but I knew about it.

1629
01:23:04,753 --> 01:23:05,180
Speaker 1: - Of course.

1630
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,356
Speaker 1: - I've known about it for most of my life, because Lockerbie bombing.

1631
01:23:08,377 --> 01:23:08,660
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

1632
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:15,860
Speaker 1: - And yet, I have talked to many, many people in the past few weeks who have never heard of that.

1633
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:23,300
Speaker 1: - Really, 'cause people I talk to-- - I was like, you know, when terrorism really appeared, as far as Westerners in the US cared.

1634
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,180
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know, before then, you could just walk into any airport right up to the gate.

1635
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,400
Speaker 0: There was no security or anything.

1636
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,353
Speaker 1: It was just like a bus station.

1637
01:23:29,373 --> 01:23:35,746
Speaker 1: - My grandfather, when he was flying back from Australia, had a machete with him, and the stewardess asked him if he could put it under his seat, because she was worried it would fall out of the overhead bin.

1638
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:36,452
Speaker 1: - Yeah, right?

1639
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:41,512
Speaker 0: After the Lockerbie bombing, that's when they added, you know, the metal detectors.

1640
01:23:41,532 --> 01:23:42,399
Speaker 0: - Well, that was one incident.

1641
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,100
Speaker 0: - Well, there's also the Iran hijacking.

1642
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:45,624
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

1643
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:47,015
Speaker 0: - That was pretty much those two.

1644
01:23:48,782 --> 01:23:49,004
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1645
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:59,799
Speaker 0: - Kinda got off on a tangent there, but-- - But yeah, most people I talk to, they know there was a thing, the Lockerbie bombing, but they couldn't tell you any details, and most they could tell you it had something to do with Libya.

1646
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:06,040
Speaker 1: - I think the Libya thing, I feel like we're going about it as NATO, at least, the best that we can.

1647
01:24:06,201 --> 01:24:15,900
Speaker 1: I don't think there's anything better we can do, short of just trying to stop the hostilities with the air strikes, and wait for everything to normalize.

1648
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:23,158
Speaker 0: - I think people are, you know, it's like, you know, Iraq War was basically like an invasion, right?

1649
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,220
Speaker 1: - Iraq War was completely unjustified.

1650
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,039
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but it's like, well, in this case, like, there's a rebel force, right?

1651
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:35,180
Speaker 0: And it's obviously good, right, and at least better than the other, you know, the loyalists, right?

1652
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,900
Speaker 0: We always like rebels better than loyalists, right?

1653
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,392
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

1654
01:24:38,863 --> 01:24:41,757
Speaker 1: - Except us.

1655
01:24:41,818 --> 01:24:45,999
Speaker 0: (laughing) - And I mean, no, we're rebels, come on.

1656
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:58,759
Speaker 0: Right, so really, if they decided to just send in, you know, a whole bunch of regular armies to go support the rebel army, I wouldn't really have a problem with that so much.

1657
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,138
Speaker 1: - It's got civil war.

1658
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:01,839
Speaker 0: - It's called civil war.

1659
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:03,920
Speaker 1: - No, that's what I was alluding to, our civil war.

1660
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:05,160
Speaker 1: We were not the rebels there.

1661
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,780
Speaker 1: I wasn't talking about the Revolutionary War.

1662
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:12,480
Speaker 0: - Oh, I thought you were talking about us personally today.

1663
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,139
Speaker 0: - No, I'm talking about us, civil war.

1664
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:18,618
Speaker 1: We were the evil empire, marching down with troops and keeping them in.

1665
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,460
Speaker 0: - No, we weren't, it was the War of Northern Aggression.

1666
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,199
Speaker 1: - So we were the bad guys, marching down.

1667
01:25:26,641 --> 01:25:29,700
Speaker 0: - No, it was, we were aggressive, but good.

1668
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,579
Speaker 1: - But we weren't rebels.

1669
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:33,398
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we were.

1670
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,099
Speaker 1: - We were rebelling against the people.

1671
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:37,978
Speaker 1: - Who rebelled against us.

1672
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,459
Speaker 0: - Yeah, they won, they took over.

1673
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,490
Speaker 1: - But I guess that's why I'm for what's going on in Libya.

1674
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,390
Speaker 0: - But yeah, actually, Revolutionary War, right?

1675
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:51,670
Speaker 0: Perfect example, right?

1676
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:57,810
Speaker 0: You got some rebels, us against loyalists, British, and the French army just comes in and joins our army, kinda.

1677
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:58,057
Speaker 0: - Well.

1678
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:02,189
Speaker 0: - Sorta, but it's a similar situation I would not have a problem with.

1679
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,970
Speaker 0: If like, you know, US Army goes in, joins Libyan rebels.

1680
01:26:05,671 --> 01:26:10,750
Speaker 1: - I think it's just a pragmatic thing to do at the time, especially because otherwise it would have failed.

1681
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:15,629
Speaker 0: - Also French people, they'll take any excuse they can to fight against French people.

1682
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:23,610
Speaker 1: - The amount of force and intervention it would take to intervene, to do something in Syria, one, would anger the entire region and destabilize everything.

1683
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:25,150
Speaker 1: It'd be ground forces, it'd be crazy.

1684
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:36,430
Speaker 1: It takes relative, compared to that, it takes relatively little to intervene in the Libya situation because we can do it primarily with our massive, massive force projection capabilities.

1685
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,350
Speaker 0: - Yep, which cost a zillion dollars.

1686
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:46,009
Speaker 1: - But at the same time, do they cost a zillion dollars or do they cost a zillion dollars regardless of whether or not we use them?

1687
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:51,470
Speaker 0: - That is a good, the question is, right, we already know that like a lot of these missiles and things cost like a million dollars each, right?

1688
01:26:51,811 --> 01:26:55,609
Speaker 0: But the question is, if we use them, are we buying new ones or are we just using it up?

1689
01:26:56,051 --> 01:27:01,590
Speaker 0: It's like, if I have a box full of ammo, well, if it just sits there, it's not like I'm saving money by not shooting it.

1690
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:03,190
Speaker 1: - I imagine it depends on, you know--.

1691
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:11,109
Speaker 1: - But if I shoot all the ammo and I don't refill it, then okay, but if I-- - I imagine it depends mostly on like what the next weapons program is, like maybe there's a new cruise missile in the works.

1692
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:11,594
Speaker 0: - I think that's.

1693
01:27:11,655 --> 01:27:17,590
Speaker 0: another problem is that we are, we are already spending money on all sorts of weapons programs and things.

1694
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:21,249
Speaker 0: - But at the same time, we spend relatively-- - But we could not be doing that.

1695
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,490
Speaker 0: But we are, so it's like--.

1696
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:27,830
Speaker 1: - I'm actually not that angry at all about our level of military spending.

1697
01:27:28,532 --> 01:27:29,209
Speaker 0: - I am.

1698
01:27:29,770 --> 01:27:31,609
Speaker 1: - Because Social Security costs way more than that.

1699
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:32,086
Speaker 0: - It does.

1700
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:33,530
Speaker 1: - Medicare, Medicaid.

1701
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:37,249
Speaker 0: - Well, no, not Medicare, but Medicare is a huge, is like number three.

1702
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:51,190
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'm saying of all the costs, we could be more streamlined in our military spending, but I feel from a pragmatic standpoint, the fact that the United States has not just overwhelming military power-- - Triply overwhelming.

1703
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:51,671
Speaker 0: - But

1704
01:27:52,113 --> 01:28:02,801
Speaker 1: at least in terms of raw force projection capabilities, unlimited power, not in terms of anything other than projecting force, not in terms of occupation, maintenance, anything like that, but in terms of

1705
01:28:03,306 --> 01:28:06,270
Speaker 0: being able to-- - We could blow up any spot on the earth we want at any time.

1706
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:07,589
Speaker 1: - Even without nuclear weapons.

1707
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:08,130
Speaker 0: - That's right.

1708
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:11,730
Speaker 1: - I feel like that in and of itself is a force of stability in the world.

1709
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:20,769
Speaker 0: - Oh, but the thing is, right, I would cut the spending, right, not on, I would still maintain-- - I'm curious what you're gonna say here.

1710
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:21,710
Speaker 1: - What do you mean you're curious?

1711
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:22,250
Speaker 0: - I'm curious.

1712
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,430
Speaker 0: - Right, the budget is gigantic, right?

1713
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:24,580
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

1714
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:30,590
Speaker 0: - We could, the force projection capabilities alone is not like 99% of that budget, right?

1715
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:34,170
Speaker 0: Who knows what percent it is, but it's not 99%.

1716
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:38,489
Speaker 0: - Right, so, and you don't wanna cut a lot of the research stuff, right, obviously, because--.

1717
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:39,990
Speaker 1: - In fact, we need to raise spending.

1718
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,326
Speaker 1: - Exactly.

1719
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:45,410
Speaker 1: - And we need to put most of that money into taking care of our goddamn veterans when they come back from wars.

1720
01:28:45,630 --> 01:29:02,547
Speaker 0: - That's true, but the thing is, I would shuffle a lot of the monies around, right, 'cause it's like you have, you keep, you up the veterans' spending, right, you keep the research spending stable, you keep the force projection capabilities, but then you take it down in all the other

1721
01:29:02,648 --> 01:29:02,790
Speaker 1: areas.

1722
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:03,190
Speaker 1: - Like what?

1723
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:04,770
Speaker 0: - What do you mean, all the other areas?

1724
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:05,910
Speaker 1: - What other, name an area.

1725
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:12,270
Speaker 0: - Like just, you know, having X number of soldiers, period, decrease, you know, shrink everything.

1726
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:14,110
Speaker 0: You don't need so much armies.

1727
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:21,190
Speaker 1: - Actually, we kinda do, because all those force projection things require a lot of supply lines and maintenance and just work.

1728
01:29:21,652 --> 01:29:24,290
Speaker 1: Most of the people in the military are doing a lot of that stuff, not the shooting.

1729
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:30,370
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but you don't need, you know, you can still maintain the force projection and get rid of a lot of the extra militariness.

1730
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:33,870
Speaker 0: That's not the only-- - I just, I'm actually kind of dubious of that.

1731
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:34,726
Speaker 0: - You think so?

1732
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:41,089
Speaker 0: - If anything, I think-- - There's also a lot of places that the military is in the world that it doesn't necessarily need to be.

1733
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:42,930
Speaker 0: - What do you mean, like where?

1734
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:43,207
Speaker 0: - Like where?

1735
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:45,889
Speaker 1: Where are they that they don't need to be?

1736
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,230
Speaker 0: - All kinds of countries.

1737
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:49,745
Speaker 0: - Same one.

1738
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:51,710
Speaker 0: - We have military bases like all over the world.

1739
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,168
Speaker 0: - Where?

1740
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:54,027
Speaker 1: Which one are we gonna get rid of?

1741
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,230
Speaker 0: - All the ones that aren't like right in the middle of doing something?

1742
01:29:58,430 --> 01:29:58,870
Speaker 1: - Like what?

1743
01:29:59,010 --> 01:29:59,549
Speaker 1: Name one.

1744
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,190
Speaker 0: - We got bases in South Korea, we got bases in Japan.

1745
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:06,730
Speaker 1: - The bases in South Korea are probably useful.

1746
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:07,967
Speaker 0: - Why?

1747
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:12,850
Speaker 1: - To be ready to deal with North Korea, which will happen probably in our lifetime.

1748
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:16,490
Speaker 0: - Well, you know, do we really need to actually be there right now?

1749
01:30:16,551 --> 01:30:17,228
Speaker 0: We can get over there.

1750
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,237
Speaker 0: - No, not really.

1751
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:24,370
Speaker 1: Without bases there, it would actually be a while to have significant, constant force maintenance there.

1752
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:25,809
Speaker 0: - We have aircraft carriers, they float around.

1753
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:29,570
Speaker 1: - They take a while to get somewhere, and that's one kind of force projection.

1754
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:31,889
Speaker 1: Having a base there provides a much different kind of force.

1755
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:32,610
Speaker 0: - Like what?

1756
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,750
Speaker 1: - Large numbers of troops on the ground to occupy in rapidity.

1757
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:39,509
Speaker 0: - But I don't think there's large numbers of people there at all the time.

1758
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,349
Speaker 1: - There's more people there than you'd think.

1759
01:30:41,831 --> 01:30:47,388
Speaker 1: Also, the logistics field to assist the South Korean military in what would eventually be a war of occupation with North Korea if it comes to that.

1760
01:30:47,934 --> 01:30:53,189
Speaker 1: Or, you know, dealing with the artillery strikes, rapid response, it takes a while for an aircraft carrier to get anywhere.

1761
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:54,769
Speaker 0: - But it's already hanging out there.

1762
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:55,767
Speaker 0: We have a lot of them.

1763
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:56,450
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and where do you work?

1764
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:57,230
Speaker 0: - More than anybody.

1765
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:57,790
Speaker 0: - Where are they?

1766
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,150
Speaker 0: - In fact, more than everyone else combined.

1767
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:00,449
Speaker 0: - Yeah, do you know where they are right now?

1768
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,270
Speaker 0: - If I did, I would be working in Washington, wouldn't I?

1769
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:04,390
Speaker 0: They don't know where they are.

1770
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:06,810
Speaker 1: It's pretty trivial to know where all our aircraft carriers are.

1771
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,650
Speaker 1: They're not difficult to find.

1772
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:09,389
Speaker 1: They're big.

1773
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:10,570
Speaker 0: - Aren't they secret?

1774
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:11,745
Speaker 1: - No, they're huge.

1775
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:14,090
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but how are you gonna find them?

1776
01:31:14,171 --> 01:31:16,308
Speaker 0: It's not like I have a satellite, but I can just find them.

1777
01:31:17,093 --> 01:31:17,809
Speaker 1: - You can find them.

1778
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:18,530
Speaker 0: - Really?

1779
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:19,569
Speaker 0: Okay, so where are they then?

1780
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:20,486
Speaker 1: - I can go look it up.

1781
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:21,590
Speaker 1: - All right.

1782
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:23,030
Speaker 1: - There's websites to track.

1783
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,650
Speaker 1: Oh, well, this one's here right now doing this.

1784
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:25,310
Speaker 1: These are over here.

1785
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:26,709
Speaker 1: Military nerds, eat that shit up.

1786
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:27,890
Speaker 0: - I don't know.

1787
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:31,609
Speaker 0: I find it hard to believe that the locations of all the aircraft carriers are just known.

1788
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:33,149
Speaker 1: - No, not the exact GPS coordinates.

1789
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:35,390
Speaker 1: You're not gonna know exactly where it is.

1790
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:37,628
Speaker 1: You'll know what region it's in, what sea it's in, where it is.

1791
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,410
Speaker 0: - People are watching these things all the time and it's just on the internet?

1792
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:43,810
Speaker 1: - And they often issue press releases of where they're going and what they're doing.

1793
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:44,346
Speaker 0: - Really?

1794
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:44,927
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

1795
01:31:45,673 --> 01:31:47,009
Speaker 1: In fact, it's on the news all the time.

1796
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:49,228
Speaker 1: Aircraft carrier going here for this.

1797
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:50,342
Speaker 0: - Uh-huh.

1798
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:53,750
Speaker 1: - The submarines are kind of secret.

1799
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:54,669
Speaker 0: - Well, that's a different story.

1800
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,310
Speaker 0: Obviously, you can't see the submarines.

1801
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,030
Speaker 1: - I guess, Scott, I'm just saying-- - That's Captain Obvious.

1802
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:09,150
Speaker 1: - My only point here is that you made a broad statement about what you think the military should be doing with its money and yet don't actually know much about what the military's doing with its money.

1803
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,810
Speaker 0: - I said at the beginning we were not qualified for this kind of podcast.

1804
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:17,890
Speaker 1: - But you've made a strong opinion despite saying that you're not qualified to make the opinion.

1805
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,589
Speaker 0: - I'm on a podcast, it's my job.

1806
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:19,915
Speaker 0: - Uh-huh.

1807
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:22,110
Speaker 0: - It's probably entertainment for the listener.

1808
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,790
Speaker 0: If I just go ho-hum, that's not very entertaining, is it?

1809
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,110
Speaker 1: - Anyway, it's been an hour and a half.

1810
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:26,729
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

1811
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:27,206
Speaker 0: - All right.

1812
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,690
Speaker 1: - This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1813
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:40,810
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1814
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:46,210
Speaker 0: - Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1815
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:49,149
Speaker 1: - Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1816
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:53,869
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1819
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:04,830
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
