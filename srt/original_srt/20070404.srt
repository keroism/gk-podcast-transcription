1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,848
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 4th.

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,012
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,360
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:20,260
Speaker 0: Tonight we preview the new anime moonlight mile.

5
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:22,497
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:39,569
Speaker 1: those of you who listen to all four nights of geek nights might have heard a Wonderful clip yesterday from another show where one of the hosts of that show had some words for our dear friend Scott here It's hard not to laugh.

7
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:52,044
Speaker 1: Alright the deal here is we didn't really go into it yesterday partly because it was video game day and not many of our Listeners on Tuesday really care about the difference between shoujo and shounen manga.

8
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:53,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's tell the story here.

9
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,145
Speaker 0: Alright, so we reviewed last week was the last week.

10
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:04,029
Speaker 0: there was indeed We reviewed a manga called to Tara and anime world order released their review of the same thing on the same night.

11
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,498
Speaker 1: Yep, slightly later.

12
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:06,564
Speaker 1: I might add.

13
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:07,570
Speaker 0: Yes slightly later.

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,550
Speaker 0: But apparently they said that was on purpose that we couldn't steal information from their review and use it in ours.

15
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:14,117
Speaker 1: How they even know we were doing it?

16
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:19,467
Speaker 0: because I told them I was bragging to him like, ah We're gonna beat you in the race to review to Tara.

17
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:19,910
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,679
Speaker 1: So you told him you were gonna beat him and then they conveniently.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,107
Speaker 1: well, we're planning on waiting and yeah.

20
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:25,328
Speaker 0: Yeah.

21
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:25,930
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway.

22
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,278
Speaker 0: So I had emailed them weeks ago.

23
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,148
Speaker 0: Let's see if I can find the exact March 7th.

24
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:32,890
Speaker 0: I emailed them.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:50,131
Speaker 0: So a month ago, I emailed them and I said cuz I had just gotten to Tara in the mail and I'd read it and vertical the company that publishes publishes to Tara was advertising it and marketing it as a shoujo Star Trek or a sci-fi emo or whatever, you know They.

26
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:55,044
Speaker 0: they called it a shoujo and it is written and drawn by keiko.

27
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:57,150
Speaker 0: Takamiya who is a shoujo master.

28
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:01,490
Speaker 1: Yep, however, it was apparently published in Japan in a shounen magazine.

29
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:04,159
Speaker 0: So it was also a shounen manga.

30
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,630
Speaker 1: Well, all the deal is we showed it to a bunch of our friends.

31
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,781
Speaker 1: We got them all to read it and without question.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,349
Speaker 1: They'd all ask after we gave it to him.

33
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:12,875
Speaker 1: So how is the shoujo?

34
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:15,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I asked them, you know one asked Alex.

35
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:23,554
Speaker 0: when I gave it to him I said alright take this and just when you're reading it think about is this shoujo or not and Tell me what you think.

36
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:26,407
Speaker 0: and when he came back he was like, yeah, I don't think this is shoujo man.

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:35,188
Speaker 0: Yeah So I emailed anime world order because they know more about anime than we do supposedly but they think they do or at least I learned.

38
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,257
Speaker 0: I Learned a lot of things.

39
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:39,389
Speaker 0: I didn't know when I listen to their show.

40
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:48,606
Speaker 0: So I often go to them with my anime questions most of the time involving old robots But sometimes not old robots or directors that aren't listed in the anime news network.

41
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,510
Speaker 0: Yeah stuff like that.

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:59,348
Speaker 0: So I said hey, I don't get a paraphrase my email But I said wise to Tara marketed to shoujo when it's not and I said a bunch of other things.

43
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:01,938
Speaker 1: basically He said oh my god to Tara is awesome.

44
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:03,283
Speaker 1: It's almost as good as Tezuka.

45
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:04,186
Speaker 1: OMG.

46
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:05,190
Speaker 1: This shit is hot.

47
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, I said it.

48
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:08,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll read my email cuz it's short.

49
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:13,850
Speaker 0: All right All right, guys, here's a tough question that might require all of your powers combined to answer.

50
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:16,605
Speaker 0: I just read to Tara volume 1 from vertical.

51
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:20,070
Speaker 0: the sales pitch They've been using is that this thing is shoujo Star Trek.

52
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:24,230
Speaker 0: The creator Keiko Takamiya is supposedly a great shoujo manga master.

53
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:29,570
Speaker 0: I said supposedly there because I didn't know who Keiko Takamiya was until a few weeks ago.

54
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:33,833
Speaker 0: So I said supposedly because that's what I heard After reading it.

55
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,122
Speaker 0: All I can say is I don't notice any shoujo at all.

56
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:38,230
Speaker 0: This is straight-up epic sci-fi manga.

57
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,957
Speaker 0: I mean this shit is awesome.

58
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:43,370
Speaker 0: I don't want to say it, but I might have to say it's on Tezuka's level.

59
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:47,443
Speaker 0: I never thought anything could be better than Phoenix, but this has the potential.

60
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,781
Speaker 0: it all depends on what happens in the rest of the volumes.

61
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,459
Speaker 0: Anyway, how the hell is the shoujo?

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,510
Speaker 0: the character designs are a little bit shoujo-ish But other than that, I noticed nothing that makes to Tara a shoujo manga.

63
00:03:57,992 --> 00:04:00,763
Speaker 0: I mean if this is shoujo then so is Phoenix.

64
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,290
Speaker 0: volume 2. what's the deal?

65
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,523
Speaker 0: Is there gonna be some hidden BL and volume 2 that are not prepared for?

66
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:11,966
Speaker 1: I'd like to jump in to note that according to the PR people for it the answer is yes Warn me now.

67
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,944
Speaker 0: Also, there's two Tara anime coming out in April if it's as good as this manga.

68
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:16,827
Speaker 0: All I can say is woot.

69
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,319
Speaker 1: Now we I don't know what kind of response we expected.

70
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,309
Speaker 1: maybe a oh they're marketing it this way because of blah or oh.

71
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,483
Speaker 1: Well, technically it was published blah and blah and blah and all the stuff that we wouldn't know.

72
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,828
Speaker 1: but instead.

73
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:34,410
Speaker 1: now This is a paraphrase clip because if you want to hear the whole thing just listen to their show.

74
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,284
Speaker 1: I don't want to waste too much time on this, but this is the response Scott got more or less.

75
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,210
Speaker 1: There are multiple questions.

76
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:46,850
Speaker 2: Do you think that if I concentrate hard enough I could kill him with the power of my mind?

77
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:51,910
Speaker 2: The thing is like his email is stupid for reasons that have nothing to do with the fact that it's not.

78
00:04:52,050 --> 00:05:00,516
Speaker 2: It doesn't take all our fucking powers combined because this is such a retarded question that No, any one of us could answer this.

79
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:05,828
Speaker 2: even if it was shoujo you would still be a condescending sexist asshole.

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,880
Speaker 2: Oh It's straight-up sci-fi.

81
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:11,130
Speaker 2: So it couldn't possibly be shoujo.

82
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:16,450
Speaker 2: You don't want to say that a shoujo work could be on par with Tezuka.

83
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:25,068
Speaker 2: I think Hagio moto You know the female Tezuka as she's referred to would have something to fucking say about that.

84
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:28,318
Speaker 2: first off Do you have any idea what shoujo means?

85
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,870
Speaker 2: you have any idea with these classifications mean in Japan?

86
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,518
Speaker 2: She's one of the women who helped to fucking define shoujo.

87
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,104
Speaker 2: God, how insulting is this?

88
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:51,064
Speaker 2: Like I just can't get over how dismissive this email is of shoujo manga Insinuating that oh, how could such a solid sci-fi series possibly be a girl's manga?

89
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:56,529
Speaker 1: and that kind of as if to imply that Only guys girls can't write sci-fi.

90
00:05:57,654 --> 00:06:01,228
Speaker 2: You know, it doesn't excuse the stupidity of this email.

91
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:04,070
Speaker 2: Oh What that's retarded.

92
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:10,310
Speaker 2: There's no words for how retarded that is and I guess it pisses me off more cuz like this is geek nights.

93
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:18,352
Speaker 2: I mean these guys do a podcast where they talk about anime And you guys are always boasting about how much you know Mr.

94
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:21,110
Speaker 2: Is that we ran the RIT anime club?

95
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:24,159
Speaker 2: So our otaku cock is the biggest.

96
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,223
Speaker 2: what now?

97
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,090
Speaker 2: No, I'm not cool with this.

98
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,567
Speaker 0: Now every time it's funny to listen to it.

99
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:50,690
Speaker 1: now All the people we've asked about this who happen to hear this episode or whatever and I'll note that this audience includes both men and women Really don't know why that happened because they also wonder why this is.

100
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:55,890
Speaker 0: Let's let's just talk about a few points rather than going over the whole thing line by line.

101
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,310
Speaker 0: Alright, first of all my opening sentence of you know, it might require all your powers combined to answer.

102
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,233
Speaker 0: It's not.

103
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:06,485
Speaker 0: that's just a silly line to open an email with.

104
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,750
Speaker 0: it's not like a literal thing.

105
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:15,877
Speaker 1: If anything even if it was literal then wouldn't that mean that you're putting great stock in their powers and that it's something you don't Have the power to answer and you trust them to do.

106
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:20,414
Speaker 0: So perhaps it does also my My quip about.

107
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,501
Speaker 0: I might have to say it's on Tezuka's level.

108
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:26,534
Speaker 0: She was all like, oh you can't say a show Joe's as good as Tezuka.

109
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:30,830
Speaker 0: I'm like, no, I Scott say anything is as good as Tezuka except Will Eisner.

110
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:37,935
Speaker 1: Scott has this pedestal and on it are Tezuka and Will Eisner and there's pretty much no one else in the world is even close To the base of that pedestal.

111
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:39,884
Speaker 0: Alan Moore is on tier two, man.

112
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,010
Speaker 0: You got to watch out.

113
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how high that pedestal is.

114
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,309
Speaker 1: If anything the fact that Scott said that this work approaches Tezuka's level is a compliment of the highest order.

115
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:56,737
Speaker 0: Secondly all that other stuff that she was going crazy about like, you know, uh Woman can't make good manga.

116
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:57,861
Speaker 0: Where did I say that?

117
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:00,490
Speaker 0: aside for the fact that did I say I just read my email.

118
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,595
Speaker 0: Did I say any of that stuff?

119
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:07,890
Speaker 1: Well, the best part is that if we're dismissive of show Joe How can we own a gigantic pile of show Joe?

120
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:09,518
Speaker 1: I mean didn't we just review?

121
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:12,150
Speaker 1: here is Greenwood which is obviously a show Joe.

122
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,989
Speaker 1: In fact, I believe the English release actually says the word show Joe on it.

123
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:16,752
Speaker 0: It does.

124
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:25,119
Speaker 0: I was actually originally weirded out by that because not that I wasn't gonna read it or I didn't like it But watching the original anime knowing nothing about it.

125
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:26,765
Speaker 0: original anime.

126
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:28,330
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's not the original anime.

127
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,754
Speaker 0: I think the manga was the original.

128
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:30,315
Speaker 1: Yes.

129
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:30,616
Speaker 1: Yes.

130
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:35,690
Speaker 0: I originally watched the anime and it seems just like a normal comedy show.

131
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:36,969
Speaker 0: It's not a show Joe show.

132
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,304
Speaker 1: well cuz show Joe in that case definitely has more to do with the target audience.

133
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,895
Speaker 1: also the fact that there is a lot of Implied BL in there.

134
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:45,548
Speaker 0: there is quite a bit of BL especially in the manga.

135
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:45,910
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:58,168
Speaker 0: But basically this all comes down to the fact that when I say the word show Joe and when I think most Anime people in America say the word show Joe they're referring to a genre based on content.

137
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:05,810
Speaker 1: Yes It doesn't help that the vast majority of show Joe manga that comes out in the US is all very much similar.

138
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:14,154
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean sure the Japanese definition of show Joe is whatever you say it is, but that's not the definition I'm using.

139
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:20,750
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like if rim says, I don't know Geek and nerd I guess it's sort of like geek.

140
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:27,346
Speaker 0: I mean rim says geeks should all die and to me the word geek means Jews.

141
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:28,870
Speaker 0: then rims an anti-semite.

142
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:32,548
Speaker 1: These eggs are anti-semitic anti-semite.

143
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:48,170
Speaker 1: Uncle Leo See not even care about that part Even though I do point out again that even a lot of the women who listen to our show Contacted us to say wow That was a little crazy It was quite the craziness.

144
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:57,795
Speaker 0: But I think in the end I'm actually happier with this kind of response to my email because if they just responded normally they would have been like no It's not a show Joe.

145
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:58,519
Speaker 0: It's a showing in.

146
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,006
Speaker 0: it was actually published in a magazine.

147
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:00,810
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah.

148
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:02,735
Speaker 0: I would have just been like huh all right.

149
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:08,850
Speaker 0: There's my answer, but instead I've gotten days of hilarious entertainment power.

150
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:18,406
Speaker 1: Now my favorite part is that aside from the show Joe whatever argument, and you can talk about that forever I mean look in America people say otaku, and they're proud of it.

151
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,270
Speaker 1: otaku is like.

152
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:22,884
Speaker 1: I'm a guy who likes anime, but in Japan otaku is.

153
00:10:23,345 --> 00:10:25,473
Speaker 1: that's that guy Yeah, likes.

154
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:27,439
Speaker 0: hentai is used differently.

155
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,170
Speaker 0: the word manga if you want to use the Japanese definition spider-man is manga.

156
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,570
Speaker 0: Yo, I mean sure some people say stuff like a makomi, but sure it's also mug.

157
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,054
Speaker 1: Well Disney is anime I know right.

158
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:44,228
Speaker 1: and honey man anime is actually a French word if you want to get technical.

159
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,835
Speaker 0: so you know What is the standard we're gonna use?

160
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:51,990
Speaker 0: because because we are in geeks in the u.s.. Enjoy a great deal of Japanese culture.

161
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:59,901
Speaker 0: There is going to be many Japanese words that enter our vernacular And we're not gonna use them the same way the Japanese people do.

162
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:02,470
Speaker 0: we're gonna use them the way that is most useful to us.

163
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:16,854
Speaker 0: You know the way languages evolve and all that yeah And all languages are are symbols that represent ideas And it's up to people as a whole who use those symbols to represent ideas to decide which ideas are represented by which symbols.

164
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:28,016
Speaker 1: now the real interesting thing here is that one and A lot of people who have read Scott's email have to agree that you really would have had to go out of your way to take that much offense to a relatively benign question.

165
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:42,204
Speaker 1: and also, I would note that after a while she stops talking about all this argument and basically just starts ragging on the fact that we ran an anime club a long time ago and That we apparently have big penises.

166
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:43,448
Speaker 0: I don't know.

167
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:48,500
Speaker 1: maybe she I don't know they might they might be jealous of our gigantic otaku cocks.

168
00:11:50,161 --> 00:12:00,340
Speaker 0: I've always gotten the feeling you know that maybe Clarissa didn't like us or something because we've Communicated a great deal with anime world order as a whole which is three people Gerald Darryl and Carilla.

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:13,740
Speaker 1: I mean the whole relationship started when I met Darryl at a con and he walks over to you with this little thing He's like you want to be recorded an interview podcast whatever and I was like I also do a podcast hello

170
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:22,053
Speaker 0: And you know mostly pretty much a hundred percent every time we talk to them It's either Darryl or Gerald talking back

171
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:22,455
Speaker 1: to us.

172
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Darryl and Gerald?

173
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:34,877
Speaker 1: all the time I talked to Darryl a lot and I didn't talk to Gerald a lot until after Otakon when we met and Pretty much the friendship was solidified in gold after they shot us in the face with clown pistols.

174
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:47,340
Speaker 0: Yeah But Clarissa never really talked to us And we never met her and I always got the feeling that either Maybe she just didn't want to talk to us or secretly hated us for some unknown reason.

175
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:56,463
Speaker 1: I would submit that she has been for the entirety of our existence Seething with both jealousy and rage and the two were in this bitter little ball And she would.

176
00:12:56,564 --> 00:13:01,020
Speaker 1: I'll bet the next email we had sent to them would have elicited the same response you could have been.

177
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:08,333
Speaker 1: Hi guys I just wanted to say Clarissa's awesome And it would have been the same tirade that could have been could have been.

178
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,725
Speaker 0: she would have been like what's with the sarcastic email Saying I'm awesome.

179
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:13,352
Speaker 0: You say all kinds of stuff is awesome.

180
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,839
Speaker 0: And yeah, that means you hate it.

181
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, all high and mighty with your RIT anime club just happens to have been the biggest anime club.

182
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:24,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, North America for number of years.

183
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:31,320
Speaker 0: The other thing is at the beginning of every anime world order they call themselves Holier-than-thou know-it-alls that or anything.

184
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:39,100
Speaker 0: But well, how can you yell at someone else for being a know-it-all when you proclaim it about yourself?

185
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,607
Speaker 0: That's sort of like saying man It's like a I don't know it.

186
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:51,936
Speaker 0: It's it's like a retarded person going up to someone and saying wow, you're retarded It's like you're making fun of yourself at the same time.

187
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,443
Speaker 1: now I also couldn't help.

188
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:57,320
Speaker 1: but pretty much at the part when she starts going on about do you know what these mean?

189
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,827
Speaker 1: Do you know what these words mean?

190
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,376
Speaker 1: and she says that a bunch more times?

191
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,060
Speaker 1: I just cut it out.

192
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,436
Speaker 1: But all I could picture was Napoleon Dynamite going surprised.

193
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:08,530
Speaker 1: You didn't know that gosh gosh.

194
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:13,500
Speaker 1: But anyway, since we don't want to dwell on that since we find it hilarious.

195
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:24,706
Speaker 1: We're not sure how many other people will find it hilarious, but in the news AFI Dallas, there's a one of the first movie reviews of paprika, which is we got to see it in one I don't even know.

196
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:27,436
Speaker 1: I just found a guy named Todd matter now ski.

197
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:28,440
Speaker 0: That's not fair.

198
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,191
Speaker 1: Well, he put this up on March 28th, that's really not fair.

199
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:35,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy saw paprika way before us Asshole.

200
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:36,406
Speaker 1: Yeah.

201
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,519
Speaker 0: Anyway, does he even know what these movies mean?

202
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:45,800
Speaker 1: He talks about this movie in the reverent terms that I would expect someone to talk about this movie.

203
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:50,759
Speaker 1: He definitely definitely has the respect for Satoshi khan.

204
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,695
Speaker 1: He and I'm not gonna read the interview or the article.

205
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:56,600
Speaker 1: you can read it for yourself.

206
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:02,055
Speaker 1: But he basically says that paprika is really really really good and it uh-huh.

207
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:03,900
Speaker 1: It's a psychological thriller.

208
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:05,759
Speaker 0: Gee, I didn't see that one coming.

209
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, who would have guessed this?

210
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:14,980
Speaker 0: Satoshi khan the god of psychological thrillers the best person at it since I don't know I know he's not quite a Hitchcock, but he's I. just he's the new animated hit.

211
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,646
Speaker 0: We want to call me animated Hitchcock.

212
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:25,900
Speaker 0: might have to new dude now maybe on the back of the DVD for paprika They'll say, you know Satoshi khan is the animated Hitchcock geek nights.

213
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:30,780
Speaker 1: It's funny cuz I was just about to say that other than Hitchcock when you jumped in there.

214
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been on a Hitchcock kick for a while though lately.

215
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:37,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got a good guy.

216
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:38,620
Speaker 0: everyone else out there.

217
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:52,978
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen every Hitchcock movie You should watch Just about every Hitchcock even the old ones because the new ones are really really really really really good and the old ones are either good or hilarious Or both.

218
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,900
Speaker 1: Yeah What was that when the man who knew too much with the dead?

219
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,759
Speaker 0: That's a good one the the the forty fifty nine steps forty nine steps.

220
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:04,760
Speaker 0: I don't know how many steps there were but I really was a number of steps.

221
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,788
Speaker 1: This was really good lady vanishes.

222
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:09,052
Speaker 0: I think is is man.

223
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,557
Speaker 0: It's a great best of the old ones.

224
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:28,679
Speaker 0: It's definitely Alright, so speaking of keiko takamiya and shoujo manga all that vertical Vertical the company that is putting out all the highbrow awesome mangas you should pretty much buy every manga They release as announced new manga woot.

225
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:32,115
Speaker 0: The first manga they have announced will come out in October.

226
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:38,179
Speaker 0: It is called Mu like mu mu by osama tessica.

227
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,232
Speaker 1: It might be mu mu.

228
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:46,962
Speaker 0: Yes, it's actually spelled like Mw.

229
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:49,408
Speaker 0: that's how it's spelled on the cover of the book.

230
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:53,880
Speaker 0: all right, but but it's pronounced mu mu mu whatever.

231
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,340
Speaker 1: Why did the cat fall off the slanted tin roof?

232
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:01,845
Speaker 1: Because he lost his mu.

233
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:05,394
Speaker 1: Yes mu being the coefficient of sliding friction.

234
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,958
Speaker 1: You see it's a physics chip.

235
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:15,680
Speaker 0: Yes well Anyway, it's a story of an unlikely union and forbidden love between an amoral banker and a priest.

236
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,259
Speaker 0: He set by guilt after they witnessed the massacre of a village.

237
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,557
Speaker 0: Aha, and that a government cover-up.

238
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:32,317
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that this one's gonna be a lot like an ode to kira hito and not so much like Phoenix and not So much like Phoenix, so if you like the ode to kira hito's you're gonna want to buy this book in October.

239
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:37,120
Speaker 0: also They've announced Andromeda stories by keiko takamiya.

240
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:40,935
Speaker 0: It seems like people really wanted that other one by her.

241
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:47,420
Speaker 0: like the first Shonen I won whatever it was called the one that song wind and trees that one that one.

242
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,131
Speaker 0: That's the one that people really want, but actually I'm pretty happy They're bringing out this one because it's more sci-fi action.

243
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,737
Speaker 1: I pretty much want to read everything.

244
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:56,600
Speaker 1: She's written at this point.

245
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:04,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'll buy whatever it whatever book this was they could have said it was like yeah Poop on a stick by keiko takamiya, and I would have still bought it.

246
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,260
Speaker 1: be the best damn poop on a stick ever.

247
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that one's only gonna be $14, and I think it's also three volumes.

248
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:13,365
Speaker 0: So Good three volumes.

249
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:21,408
Speaker 1: I'm liking this not so long thing because I love here is Greenwood But as much as I love it over all these years I still haven't read the end because it's just.

250
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,040
Speaker 1: it's eight volumes, and that's not even a long manga, sir.

251
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only way I can read I can't read a manga series.

252
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,015
Speaker 0: That's more than 20 volumes.

253
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:28,737
Speaker 0: Just period.

254
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:30,565
Speaker 0: I can't do it No matter no matter what.

255
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,256
Speaker 0: well, I guess initial D, but other than that.

256
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:34,139
Speaker 0: No I can't do it.

257
00:18:34,382 --> 00:18:37,898
Speaker 1: See I couldn't even read initial D. I got one volume into that and said fuck this.

258
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:38,160
Speaker 0: yeah.

259
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:42,817
Speaker 0: And the only reason I could read initial D is because I do it one volume at a time every couple months.

260
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,847
Speaker 0: if you gave Me all of initial D at once.

261
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:45,893
Speaker 0: I just give you the finger.

262
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:46,496
Speaker 0: I'd be like no.

263
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:47,260
Speaker 0: I can't be done.

264
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:51,867
Speaker 0: Sorry, you know I mean granted Like 12 volumes is long.

265
00:18:52,288 --> 00:19:00,459
Speaker 1: if somehow without compromising the pacing in the story Sanctuary had been 30 or 40 or 50 volumes long you probably just kept reading it in one straight.

266
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:02,571
Speaker 0: go Probably, but if it was all at once.

267
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:04,140
Speaker 0: I don't think I could could have done it.

268
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:05,084
Speaker 1: I think I could have.

269
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:06,309
Speaker 1: I think I could.

270
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:10,245
Speaker 0: I mean I have a hard enough time reading those big black marvel Essential books I get.

271
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:14,439
Speaker 1: uh I think there's a reason you have a hard time reading those more even the ones that I like.

272
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:25,651
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, the third manga that they're releasing is the goo in saga Manga the seven magi by karu kurimoto.

273
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,075
Speaker 1: Did he done anything else?

274
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:28,780
Speaker 0: I never heard of this ever.

275
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:30,432
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about it.

276
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:36,376
Speaker 0: I didn't research it I know nothing, but I think it's a fantasy and it deals with dragons and magi.

277
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:44,540
Speaker 0: Oh really Yep, I have been in a dragon dearth lately and people always talk about how you know anime fans.

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,220
Speaker 0: They like fantasy, but most anime tends to be sci-fi or not fantasy.

279
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,607
Speaker 0: What have been the last great fantasy anime?

280
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:56,580
Speaker 0: I mean obviously war eska flown a eska flown a twelve kingdoms.

281
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:57,745
Speaker 0: I didn't see that.

282
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,216
Speaker 1: I guess brave story the main stories fantasy.

283
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:04,311
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, definitely When you really get down to think about like you slayers.

284
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:10,457
Speaker 0: Yeah true, but if you ask someone like are there Rumono, I don't know if that really counts, but I think it does.

285
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,556
Speaker 0: anyway If you go up and ask someone like hey are there lots of fantasy anime that are awesome?

286
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:24,380
Speaker 0: someone will say yeah There are lots of awesome fantasy anime But then when you get down to counting them you can write them all on one piece of paper with big text.

287
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:30,906
Speaker 0: It's really not so many and even less that are really good, so if vertical thinks It's good.

288
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,204
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, finally.

289
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:34,469
Speaker 0: We got a fantasy manga.

290
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:40,452
Speaker 1: That is the hotness I suppose, but Scott I thought you were a sexist who wouldn't read anything that girls wrote.

291
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,760
Speaker 1: so why are you excited about keiko's manga?

292
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,724
Speaker 0: Gee, I don't know.

293
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:45,928
Speaker 0: Maybe it's cuz.

294
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:48,216
Speaker 0: uh I don't know.

295
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:49,359
Speaker 0: cuz it's awesome.

296
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,335
Speaker 1: Pitaka sui.

297
00:20:58,516 --> 00:20:58,817
Speaker 1: gee.

298
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,083
Speaker 0: oh you got to start doing that.

299
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:08,630
Speaker 1: you remember way back We did a thing of the day where it was basically a bunch of these Rube Goldberg machine videos from this educational show on TV in Japan.

300
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:11,678
Speaker 1: Well that show has not failed to disappoint.

301
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:14,686
Speaker 1: aside from having those awesome awesome awesome shorts.

302
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:17,694
Speaker 1: They've also had these Algorithm dances.

303
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:25,778
Speaker 1: if you can't figure out what an algorithm dance would be I'd suggest you just watch this video And all will become clear rather quickly.

304
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,770
Speaker 1: continue watching and you will see what happens when you add ninjas to an algorithm dance.

305
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:34,309
Speaker 0: I get the feeling that this show is a lot like square one was to us.

306
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:42,096
Speaker 0: So I mean think about how far we've come if first we watch square one And then we wanted to watch square one But we couldn't and then we got the internet.

307
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:45,870
Speaker 0: so we searched for square one and we found it and now we're not satisfied.

308
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,544
Speaker 0: So we have to watch the Japanese equivalent of square one.

309
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:49,630
Speaker 1: It does make me happy.

310
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:53,778
Speaker 1: I remember as a kid like when the internet Remember used to not be able to find stuff like this.

311
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:59,758
Speaker 1: the ability to find video on the internet at all is A crazy new idea yet.

312
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,182
Speaker 1: We're already totally dependent on it.

313
00:22:01,242 --> 00:22:02,145
Speaker 1: if YouTube disappeared.

314
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:03,450
Speaker 1: We wouldn't know what to do.

315
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,564
Speaker 0: All I gotta say is I really want to watch Russian square one.

316
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:21,789
Speaker 1: Oh, yes If you have to copy lists and one of them is executed in the back of the brother Anyway these things are about as amusing as the length of the video so just check it out.

317
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:23,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's alright.

318
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,402
Speaker 0: I wasn't big a fan.

319
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:25,970
Speaker 1: I don't know I like stuff like this.

320
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:32,469
Speaker 1: I wish they would have been more complex But I have the feeling if they were more complex kids wouldn't be able to just figure them out and do them.

321
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:34,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, well alright.

322
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:37,943
Speaker 0: I've been doing a lot of stuff involving old comics lately.

323
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:41,733
Speaker 0: You know I'm reading old Dick Tracy comics Reading.

324
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:46,646
Speaker 0: I just read cavalier and clay which is all about old comics and everyone should read that book.

325
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,050
Speaker 0: It's like my new favorite novel.

326
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:58,341
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah for those of you who think that American Comics just started it underwear perverts and stayed underwear perverts There is this whole era of detective stories and pirate stories.

327
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:20,274
Speaker 0: the comics really started as comic strips in the newspaper and But even back then Comics started out awesome in the u.s.. And then they got crappy and now they're getting awesome again mostly because manga is forcing the issue yes, and it was only crappy in the middle the long middle and Back in the day.

328
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:22,806
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people making comics in the early days.

329
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:26,738
Speaker 0: You know there was Will Eisner who's the best comics ever.

330
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,105
Speaker 0: there's Chester Gould the Dick Tracy guy.

331
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:37,999
Speaker 0: there were a bunch of other people too But one guy whose name keeps coming up but I didn't know anything about him is Milton Kniff or Milton Caniff can I FF?

332
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,182
Speaker 0: and He's famous for two things as far as I know.

333
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:48,790
Speaker 0: number one of them is Terry and the pirates Which I really want to read because it's pirates, but I can't find it.

334
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:49,641
Speaker 1: I don't know.

335
00:23:49,742 --> 00:23:58,654
Speaker 1: a lot of things I have wanted to check out because they were pirates have turned out to be either at best a tenuous link to pirates or Absolutely god-awful.

336
00:23:58,835 --> 00:23:59,637
Speaker 0: well no there.

337
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:00,379
Speaker 0: I can guarantee.

338
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,746
Speaker 1: This is not god-awful except for Polly and the pirates.

339
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:05,775
Speaker 0: yeah well right here I have my thing of the day.

340
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:17,270
Speaker 0: some guy was going through the the estate of Milton Caniff With his family because he's going to do a DVD release of the live-action Steve Canyon television series.

341
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:33,609
Speaker 0: that's the other thing he's famous for is the Steve Canyon comic in the newspaper and When he was there he found a bunch of inks of daily and Sunday Comic strips of Steve Canyon and with permission they've scanned them in and you can read them at this website.

342
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:35,275
Speaker 0: now Look at this for a second.

343
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:36,821
Speaker 0: look how awesome.

344
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:37,282
Speaker 0: This is.

345
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:43,403
Speaker 0: compare this to like I don't know 1960s Superman 1970s Spider-Man or 1980s Superman.

346
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:45,778
Speaker 1: 1990s Superman.

347
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:54,490
Speaker 0: yeah, this is like 1940s and 1930s 1950s like war comics.

348
00:24:54,811 --> 00:25:04,719
Speaker 0: You know cowboys and navy guys and all that sort of stuff and you look at it, and he's just like wow Comics really went downhill didn't they?

349
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,710
Speaker 1: how did it go from that to the infinity identity gauntlet crisis whatever?

350
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:12,382
Speaker 0: Imagine if comics had gone from here and content.

351
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:22,370
Speaker 0: American comics had taken this and Continually improved instead of going downhill into the superhero crap shit, and that's like saying improving all the way until today.

352
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:31,268
Speaker 0: That's like saying imagine if Rome hadn't fallen and it continued on Rome hadn't fallen and we still had Roman concrete in Damascus.

353
00:25:31,308 --> 00:25:31,670
Speaker 0: steel.

354
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,047
Speaker 0: how good these comics are.

355
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:44,161
Speaker 0: and Whether you're a fan of comics at all whether you were alive whether you've ever heard the name Milton Kenneth before whether you know Who Steve Canyon is it doesn't matter.

356
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:45,590
Speaker 0: you should go and read?

357
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,310
Speaker 0: It's just like a handful of scanned in comic strips.

358
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,937
Speaker 0: There are three or four panels each.

359
00:25:50,439 --> 00:26:00,480
Speaker 0: it won't give hurt you to take the 15 minutes to look at them And I just want everyone to see that old comics are Freaking awesome and superhero comics kind of suck.

360
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:01,162
Speaker 1: Yes.

361
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:01,784
Speaker 1: Yes.

362
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:02,045
Speaker 1: Yes.

363
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:03,530
Speaker 1: Yes, I concur.

364
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:11,650
Speaker 1: So speaking of things that are awesome and things that suck a while ago We talked about how we were excited about this anime called Moonlight Mile.

365
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,702
Speaker 0: Yes, I download cuz I download pretty much.

366
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:27,709
Speaker 0: I go to anime ski every day and I subscribe to the RSS feed and if there's any show that has a number one that I haven't seen before or If there's a promo for a show I'll look up to see if the shows might be interesting and I'll watch a promo.

367
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:28,974
Speaker 0: it takes Five minutes why not?

368
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:40,190
Speaker 1: you also might remember that we used to review a lot of and well not review But I guess preview a lot of anime when one or two episodes came out just to talk about it and lately We've kind of been reviewing a lot of old stuff or things.

369
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,865
Speaker 0: That's because news shows stopped coming out.

370
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:48,870
Speaker 1: cuz we're in between Seasons now we also skipped a lot of those first episodes because they were all pretty bad.

371
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know a new anime season is starting.

372
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:58,903
Speaker 0: if you go to anime ski right now there's like three or four number one episodes of new shows that are just being fansubbed.

373
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:05,950
Speaker 0: new anime are coming out people and We're gonna tell you which ones to watch and which ones did not even bother downloading.

374
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:09,423
Speaker 1: So there are certain genres in anime and manga.

375
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:11,430
Speaker 1: They're very much at least in the u.s.

376
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,634
Speaker 1: underrepresented.

377
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:31,670
Speaker 1: these are the genres that include such things as realistic mecha military conflicts Realistic military serious military conflict not you know gun and Gundam military conflict or gun parade march military Conflict yes political machinations and when I say political stuff.

378
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:37,730
Speaker 0: I mean gassaraki level because gossery level first president of Japan Eagle level.

379
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:49,708
Speaker 1: I mean if you think that Gundam wing or really any Gundam was actually a political show or a political manga No, gassaraki, which included giant robots was primarily about grain exports.

380
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:52,818
Speaker 0: Yep Yes, that's how political that shit is.

381
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,370
Speaker 0: but I mean the ghost in the shell also is kind of political.

382
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,640
Speaker 0: I mean, it's mostly about refugees.

383
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:00,690
Speaker 1: Yeah and ghost in the shell is right up our alley.

384
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, well a second gig anyway, the other parts of ghost Michelle and out of our refugees.

385
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:05,967
Speaker 0: They're about cyberspace, but they're also right up our.

386
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:13,460
Speaker 0: yes Oh, you watch the promotional clip for Moonlight Mile where they interviewed the you know The guys doing the anime and they showed a lot of clips from the show.

387
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,829
Speaker 0: and this show had all the following elements.

388
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:16,210
Speaker 0: You ready?

389
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:30,821
Speaker 0: politics robots space Mountain climbing mountain climbing badass people high to high Animation production values world politics and war.

390
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:40,837
Speaker 0: they showed Navy ships and big battles going on carriers and fighter jets and walking robots and flying Spaceships and factories on the moon.

391
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:45,230
Speaker 1: now most important is that astronauts it had and it was very obvious from this.

392
00:28:45,592 --> 00:29:00,110
Speaker 1: It had that element that we loved so much that was in sanctuary and eagle and everything Where there's two men or two edges two people who together despite their different backgrounds have become friends and are now walking forward with their own two feet toward destiny.

393
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:06,870
Speaker 0: And we saw this promo and we said and that's gonna be a good show right there.

394
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,586
Speaker 1: Now consider this aside from just all the things that had the promo wasn't done.

395
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,579
Speaker 1: like a lot of the other promos We've seen it was high production value.

396
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,190
Speaker 1: The anime is obviously got a lot of backing behind it.

397
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:19,285
Speaker 1: It is definitely one of those high production.

398
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:20,330
Speaker 1: check this out.

399
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:27,310
Speaker 0: This is ah, well, it's based on a manga and I don't know much about the manga because there really isn't that much information.

400
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was written by Yasuo Otagaki.

401
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:38,069
Speaker 0: Yep I saw it in the store because I was in the Japanese bookstore the last week and there are a lot of volumes of it which means this must be popular in Japan.

402
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:42,663
Speaker 0: and Just looking at the covers in the pages of the manga.

403
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:43,990
Speaker 0: It looked a lot like the anime.

404
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:46,058
Speaker 0: So that's all I can say about that.

405
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:46,480
Speaker 1: Yes.

406
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,925
Speaker 1: Well the anime news network lists.

407
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:53,521
Speaker 1: This guy has having written Moonlight Mile the manga and Moonlight Mile the TV.

408
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,510
Speaker 1: He's credited as the creator of the manga on which it was based.

409
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:58,085
Speaker 0: Oh, well, that's good then.

410
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:09,349
Speaker 1: Yes But this promo aside from obviously making it known that this is the big production thing If anything, I'd guess that the manga was super popular and people have been looking forward to this in Japan for a while.

411
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:15,690
Speaker 1: But the promo gave us this feeling that rare feeling that this is gonna be one of those awesome show.

412
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:25,870
Speaker 0: I think the thing that really gave me a good feeling in the promo is they showed these two guys climbing Mount Everest and They showed that these guys on the top of Mount Everest could see space.

413
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,650
Speaker 0: They could see a space station and I was like, can you really see space for Mount Everest?

414
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,114
Speaker 1: and the scene was just done.

415
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:40,350
Speaker 1: so well you see these two men on the very top of the world and they've gotten there under Their own blood sweat got steel and they want to go higher.

416
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:46,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not satisfied with that and they climb Mount Everest just to sit there and say I want to go up there.

417
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:53,088
Speaker 1: Yeah And then it cuts up and now space and that's where the show is actually gonna take place and it shut.

418
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,192
Speaker 1: the way it was Put together.

419
00:30:54,212 --> 00:30:56,300
Speaker 1: there was no way this could be bad.

420
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,810
Speaker 1: This is gonna be the greatest anime ever made.

421
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,888
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not the greatest ever made but one of the greatest ever made.

422
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:08,007
Speaker 1: now I probably should have thought about this because I remember when this exact thing happened to us once before.

423
00:31:08,027 --> 00:31:08,950
Speaker 0: when did it happen before?

424
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,974
Speaker 1: Well way back.

425
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:16,220
Speaker 1: We saw the promo for a movie called cash and The promotional trailer.

426
00:31:16,261 --> 00:31:20,155
Speaker 0: I think it's called Casern Cas s h e r n.

427
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,820
Speaker 1: Well this but that was based on.

428
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:26,735
Speaker 1: well loosely based on Kishon or Kishon robot hunter Which is this god-awful anime?

429
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:28,682
Speaker 0: Yes, we didn't realize that at first.

430
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:30,730
Speaker 0: that was a trick cuz it was a different spelling.

431
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:42,777
Speaker 0: There was this great trailer for a live-action like sort of Japanese super action movie called Casern C a s s h e r n and we said that Trailer looks like the best movie ever made

432
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:46,189
Speaker 1: and we were excited about it and we were so excited

433
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:47,212
Speaker 0: with the high Expectation.

434
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:51,005
Speaker 1: it was one of those things where everyone we showed the trailer to said when is that coming out?

435
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,270
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

436
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:53,534
Speaker 0: Yes, it was like.

437
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:55,201
Speaker 0: I need to see that now.

438
00:31:55,502 --> 00:31:57,530
Speaker 0: I need to see that yesterday ten times.

439
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:10,490
Speaker 0: Then it finally came out and we watched it and first thing we realized was oh, this is based on Robot hunter Casern C a s s a h n which again is one of the worst anime ever made one of the worst anime.

440
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:18,841
Speaker 0: And then we watched the movie and while it had lots of awesome special effects and the occasional But short action scene of awesome.

441
00:32:19,444 --> 00:32:20,889
Speaker 0: It was pretty god-awful.

442
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,350
Speaker 1: Now we we've been bitten once by this and we didn't learn our lesson.

443
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:29,623
Speaker 0: There was no way I could relate moonlight mile to cuz haha.

444
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:29,864
Speaker 1: Yes.

445
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,210
Speaker 1: I didn't relate to laugh to the fact.

446
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,889
Speaker 1: You see we were so excited about this and this promo made it look so awesome.

447
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:43,503
Speaker 1: I recommend if nothing else watch the promo to this and try to tell me this doesn't look like a great show Unless you're a crappy person.

448
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:44,470
Speaker 0: You don't like this sort of thing.

449
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:48,369
Speaker 1: So then we got a hold of episode 1 and the opening.

450
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:52,249
Speaker 1: See like the open at the opener the you know minute and 30-second thing.

451
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:58,850
Speaker 0: Thing that happens before the opener with the music like the prologue the thing that would say prologue on the DVD.

452
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:06,129
Speaker 0: it shows this woman on the moon and she's an astronaut and she's just astronauting around, you know.

453
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:07,973
Speaker 0: and Something I forget.

454
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:11,525
Speaker 0: something happens and it's no good and like her friend dies and she's alone.

455
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:12,750
Speaker 1: She's trapped on the moon.

456
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:18,510
Speaker 1: Well, there's a base on the moon and all this stuff, but she is too far away from anyone to get help.

457
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,181
Speaker 1: She's running out of oxygen.

458
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:21,390
Speaker 1: She's going to die.

459
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:33,164
Speaker 1: She knows of one place where there might be an oxygen tank or two Stash where she can maybe if she runs Crazily and practically killed herself from exhaustion can get there and survive for a few more.

460
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:35,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, so pretty much she's dead.

461
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:54,477
Speaker 0: The only way she can possibly live is to run on the moon really fast Which you think would be easy because it's low gravity but it's actually pretty hard because you're wearing a heavy space suit that weighs hundreds of pounds and She starts running and jumping across the moon as fast as she can to get to this oxygen tank Which is the only way she can live.

462
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:56,083
Speaker 1: and she stumbles upon.

463
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:56,886
Speaker 1: this isn't a spoil.

464
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:57,930
Speaker 1: this happens right away.

465
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,718
Speaker 0: This is the first thing that happens in the show.

466
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,470
Speaker 1: She stumbles upon all this stuff.

467
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:05,524
Speaker 1: She comes over a ridge and there's stuff there.

468
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:13,290
Speaker 1: There's some sort of base There's all these century robots and she realizes immediately that she's just seen something that she was not supposed to see.

469
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:20,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's one thing if like the Apollo guys, you know They come with a little lunar land or whatever and then they see like a giant base.

470
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:25,210
Speaker 0: Now it's one thing if that base was put there by aliens and it's like oh an alien base.

471
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,255
Speaker 0: you have one sort of plot.

472
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:38,250
Speaker 0: what if that base is put there by some earth people and You're like the astronauts have this crap technology and someone else on earth has much better technology and it's on the moon already.

473
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:40,129
Speaker 0: Hey, no one knows about it.

474
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:47,862
Speaker 1: Yeah But you right now or even just along the lines of you've stumbled on to some sort of secret military thing that you weren't supposed to know about.

475
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:55,656
Speaker 0: yeah Running around in the desert and all of a sudden you were in area 51 and there were like stuff there that you weren't supposed to see.

476
00:34:56,569 --> 00:34:59,139
Speaker 1: and This scene was really really well done.

477
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,042
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so great.

478
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:04,250
Speaker 0: Like as soon as I saw this scene I was like, oh, yeah That's what it's about and all of us are sitting around a while.

479
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,760
Speaker 1: This is actually gonna be a great anime and then the opening starts.

480
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,575
Speaker 1: the minute and 30 second music thing and the opener has the Most pump you up.

481
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:15,930
Speaker 1: This is going to be an epic political thriller music you've ever heard.

482
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,019
Speaker 0: I don't know the music actually in the opener.

483
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,144
Speaker 0: I don't think is that epic.

484
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:20,390
Speaker 1: Well, it's it pumps you up.

485
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,110
Speaker 1: It's definitely keeps you on edge.

486
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:29,359
Speaker 0: It does and the thing I think we're really is great about the opener is all the things they show you Because they basically show you all the stuff that you see.

487
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:44,230
Speaker 0: in the preview that we took that was so awesome is the showing you space and robots and Politics and aircraft carriers and people being badass climbing mountains and all that stuff is in the opener And you see that all and you go.

488
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:48,250
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah This is the show because they're showing you all the stuff that you want to see and you're like.

489
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:51,021
Speaker 0: I can't wait to see all that some more now.

490
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:51,885
Speaker 1: Here's the.

491
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:56,356
Speaker 0: it's like a taste Early letting you lick the foie gras But then not feeding it to you.

492
00:35:56,477 --> 00:36:16,631
Speaker 1: the earliest sign of trouble with this anime was that After all that the opener ends and the show starts that epic music pretty much keeps playing constantly in every scene and You know Sometimes music can build you to an emotional crescendo or can heighten a mood or pump you up a little bit or keep you on Edge.

493
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:23,897
Speaker 1: what if the music just doesn't stop and it's always just holding you on edge and keeping you in suspense And it just never lets up.

494
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,570
Speaker 0: I didn't really notice it after a while.

495
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:31,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, until we watched the second episode and I noticed it through the whole thing because I was paying attention to it.

496
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:34,190
Speaker 0: No, I didn't even notice any music at all playing.

497
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:36,450
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell if you played the song for this show.

498
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,694
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you really.

499
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:41,648
Speaker 1: the episode we just watched had epic music playing almost the entire time.

500
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:42,455
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like.

501
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:50,030
Speaker 0: if I think about it I'm like, yeah there was but I can't actually bring the music to my mind because it was not good or memorable at all.

502
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:50,511
Speaker 1: It was.

503
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:56,230
Speaker 1: it was kind of like if you're watching a movie the music they would play at the climax of an important action scene.

504
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:58,579
Speaker 1: It's just playing continuously throughout this show.

505
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:05,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really should have called the the Hacksign noir person who does that music to do this show.

506
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:07,010
Speaker 1: music like that might have fit this show really?

507
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:07,713
Speaker 0: Well, I know.

508
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:16,659
Speaker 1: however all that aside it starts out much like you would expect with these two guys climbing Mount Everest and Backstories on them and all sorts of political thing.

509
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,890
Speaker 1: It kind of sets up the whole show in the first episode bit by bit.

510
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first episode is kind of weird.

511
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:36,875
Speaker 0: I've only seen two episodes but they were way different and the first episode obviously sort of touches on Every possible area of the plot a little bit so that anything they just jump into in the future You're not totally lost on.

512
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,180
Speaker 0: you know, it's like alright.

513
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:40,327
Speaker 0: Do you have these three or four plot lines?

514
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:41,010
Speaker 0: Maybe five?

515
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:50,150
Speaker 0: We're gonna start off each one of them But mostly we're gonna start off the big one Which is the two main characters who want to go into space and they climb Mount Everest.

516
00:37:50,311 --> 00:38:00,030
Speaker 1: Yes, the basic plot as far as anyone will be able to tell you in this show Is that earth is typical earth and as always their energy it's in the future.

517
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,200
Speaker 0: So this high technology but not the too far off future.

518
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:11,990
Speaker 1: It's definitely the within our life the 20-somethings and They've discovered helium-3 on the moon, which they can now use in reactors to make energy.

519
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:18,810
Speaker 1: So the plan is to build nuclear reactors and mines on the moon and beam the power with microwaves back to the earth.

520
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:19,995
Speaker 0: That's the plan.

521
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,346
Speaker 1: now consider for a moment most anime.

522
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:27,350
Speaker 1: if they did something like that We just leave it at that and there'd be this plot semi unrelated to that in this show.

523
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:31,450
Speaker 1: You can already see where this is going a little bit because they treat it realistically.

524
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,342
Speaker 1: Alright, so we're going to spend massive effort to get a lot of energy from the moon.

525
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:43,304
Speaker 1: energy like that would marginalize a lot of Middle Eastern powers that currently have a stranglehold on the world's oil reserves.

526
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:47,095
Speaker 1: It would have great Sociopolitical ramifications.

527
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:51,290
Speaker 1: also the fact that only a few nations are flight our spaceflight capable.

528
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:53,409
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I'm currently in the real world.

529
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:59,186
Speaker 1: How many countries have the resources to go to the moon at all let alone do anything then?

530
00:38:59,226 --> 00:39:00,772
Speaker 0: we can't even remember how to get There.

531
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:02,624
Speaker 0: we could do it in the 60s.

532
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:03,449
Speaker 0: We can't do it now.

533
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:08,810
Speaker 1: So this is obviously a huge huge huge deal and that is kind of where the plot is going.

534
00:39:09,111 --> 00:39:15,810
Speaker 1: But the plot initially follows more these two guys the main characters climbing Mount Everest in their goal to eventually go into space.

535
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:20,330
Speaker 0: Yes, basically you have these two guys and all they do is they were mountain climbers.

536
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:27,930
Speaker 0: They wanted to go higher and higher and by the time one of them was like 22 years old They climbed the highest mountain on every continent.

537
00:39:28,092 --> 00:39:30,794
Speaker 0: It was like oh where the you know They couldn't get any better.

538
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:38,036
Speaker 0: and then they in the first episode they climb Everest and it's like ah shits and it's like oh Where are we gonna go from here?

539
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:41,250
Speaker 0: Well, we have to go to space where there are no limits.

540
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:42,792
Speaker 1: Yeah Now the two men.

541
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:44,658
Speaker 1: it's one of those typical tropes of.

542
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:52,034
Speaker 0: one of them is a Japanese guy Goro and the other one kind of silly And he likes to drink a lot Women eyes.

543
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:53,621
Speaker 1: he likes to be naked.

544
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:55,067
Speaker 0: He likes to be naked.

545
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:55,650
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

546
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:58,644
Speaker 1: See, this is this is where the show really takes a turn.

547
00:39:58,684 --> 00:39:59,950
Speaker 1: I'm really interested in the show.

548
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:01,735
Speaker 1: I think it has a lot of potential.

549
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:09,663
Speaker 1: However, one Goro is more naked more often Than is necessary to the plots to.

550
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:16,804
Speaker 1: the other guy is like this Boring straight man lost a man is the American and he's the smooth cool.

551
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:17,587
Speaker 1: Hello.

552
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:22,602
Speaker 1: I am the American Yeah, but it's like I've pilot fighter jets for a living.

553
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:28,830
Speaker 0: It's like Goro is like the cool nor normal Ish guy you can kind of relate to but he's kind of weird naked all the time.

554
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,188
Speaker 0: So you don't really want to relate to him.

555
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:35,170
Speaker 1: He's like a caricature of a really manly guy and they go a little too far with it.

556
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:41,510
Speaker 1: So it's not just like oh, he's a ladies man, but they continually show him having sex with women.

557
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:48,302
Speaker 0: yeah, and lost man is like Stereotypical like hard-ass doesn't say anything.

558
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:49,306
Speaker 0: He's like the Terminator.

559
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:49,708
Speaker 0: all see now.

560
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:50,210
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

561
00:40:50,371 --> 00:40:52,741
Speaker 1: I don't think that's gonna be an issue because we've only seen two episodes.

562
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:54,489
Speaker 1: episode one set up the whole show.

563
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:56,959
Speaker 1: Episode two all about Goro.

564
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,630
Speaker 1: I'm almost certain that episode three is all about lost men.

565
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,494
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it is.

566
00:41:00,514 --> 00:41:01,860
Speaker 0: how could it not be?

567
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,850
Speaker 0: if it wasn't the show would make no sense.

568
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:06,049
Speaker 0: But it seems like with the show.

569
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:11,310
Speaker 0: I think the major problem I have with the show is that it tries to do a whole lot in a small amount of space.

570
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:19,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, this might be mitigated later on but the first episode especially crammed like eight episodes worth of stuff and ideas into one episode.

571
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:28,350
Speaker 0: yeah episode two basically took Goro from Finishing climbing Mount Everest - yes now you can go into space in one episode.

572
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:29,209
Speaker 0: It's like whoa.

573
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,236
Speaker 0: That was a lot of stuff.

574
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:32,530
Speaker 0: usually an anime would drag that out.

575
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,959
Speaker 0: It's like three episodes being like.

576
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,450
Speaker 0: is he gonna get into space?

577
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were definitely points in the episode where I thought wow this was a normal anime.

578
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:42,229
Speaker 1: They would have spent a couple episodes on that right there.

579
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:49,370
Speaker 0: I guess it's better than what some anime do where they have a big long story They want to tell and not so many episodes.

580
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,890
Speaker 0: So they either just cut it short and leave you hanging or they cram.

581
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:56,542
Speaker 0: They'll go at a normal pace and then cram the whole rest of it.

582
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:57,626
Speaker 0: It's like one episode.

583
00:41:57,646 --> 00:42:12,110
Speaker 1: It's unintelligible Scrap princess where the entire show all of the plot took place after the eye catch in the last episode And like Beck Mongolian chop squad, which the the manga is actually really really good.

584
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:28,120
Speaker 0: But the anime which is equally good crammed there like they did 26 episodes of plot at the normal pacing and then After the end of the 26 episode during the credits they took the entire rest of the manga and crammed it into that Epilogue while the credits were rolling.

585
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:28,482
Speaker 1: Now.

586
00:42:28,522 --> 00:42:29,850
Speaker 1: The thing is the pace isn't bad.

587
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:38,206
Speaker 1: I mean this pace is working for me so far because every time I start to lose interest in anything that's going on at all Immediately the plot has progressed a little bit.

588
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:38,649
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

589
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:44,390
Speaker 1: However, I think the point where we really started to question it was during the first episode where everything's going along normally.

590
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,261
Speaker 1: I'll be a little confused Lee and then I think it was right.

591
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:51,305
Speaker 1: after the eye catch the show reopens With what looks like an orgy.

592
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:56,010
Speaker 0: for a second I had to go back and watch it cuz they didn't understand what the hell was going on or why there was an orgy.

593
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:56,752
Speaker 0: I didn't want it.

594
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:59,562
Speaker 0: Don't confuse it for wanting to see the orgy again.

595
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:01,810
Speaker 0: Ah, that's the easy joke to make.

596
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:02,756
Speaker 1: We're all sitting there.

597
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,709
Speaker 1: Was that a bunch of Sherpas having sex?

598
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:18,930
Speaker 0: I think that was a bunch of Sherpas having sex and we just go back and it's basically Goro having sex with a Sherpa girl and then lost men having sex with a Sherpa girl and they're right next to each other and they Have giant like Zangief style muscles.

599
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:22,069
Speaker 1: I don't know why all the men seem to have giant Zangief style.

600
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:22,210
Speaker 1: much.

601
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:39,569
Speaker 1: The thing is this does remind me in a lot of ways of like sanctuary in terms of what goes on and the pacing and I Mean, there's all this sexually charged content and especially in the second episode You'll often have characters having a conversation while they're having sex and they just show it pretty much straight up.

602
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:47,339
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean sometimes you know I'm not against characters having sex and a lot of times it makes sense like in sanctuary pretty much all the time There's a sexy scene.

603
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:48,569
Speaker 0: It makes sense.

604
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:55,750
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean like the time where the creepy old politician says come ma Asami mount this woman with me.

605
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:57,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, prove that you have the guts to be a politician.

606
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:05,416
Speaker 0: That's a very important scene because of what he says right after that which is you know Hojo has to do things 10,000 times worse than this.

607
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:10,600
Speaker 0: and then you see hojo just sitting there like living it up Living it up with a cigar and drink.

608
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:12,390
Speaker 0: It's a hilarious joke.

609
00:44:12,896 --> 00:44:13,890
Speaker 0: That's why it's necessary.

610
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:17,390
Speaker 0: But in this a lot of it seems kind of unnecessary.

611
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:28,206
Speaker 0: Like they didn't even say anything about the Sherpa sex and only upon thinking about it you realize oh There in case they die on Everest is one last fuck and actually the ball.

612
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,815
Speaker 1: it all really makes sense And it's done pretty well.

613
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:35,090
Speaker 1: and that idea that they live in life to the fullest they might die.

614
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:38,567
Speaker 1: So they're gonna do everything they can to enjoy their last day just in case.

615
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:40,135
Speaker 1: yeah And it's pretty.

616
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:43,230
Speaker 0: I mean as deep thing is they just kind of throw that orgy in there.

617
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,404
Speaker 0: You don't realize what it is unless you think about it and maybe watch it again.

618
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:48,860
Speaker 0: Like it was so quick but I guess it wasn't.

619
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:55,722
Speaker 0: I Never realized who was fucking who I just like.

620
00:44:55,782 --> 00:44:56,627
Speaker 0: Oh my god norgy.

621
00:44:56,647 --> 00:44:57,089
Speaker 0: What the hell?

622
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just popped out of nowhere like orgies tend to I guess.

623
00:45:02,612 --> 00:45:04,830
Speaker 1: Now the thing is the second episode.

624
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:11,510
Speaker 1: There's two characters and other characters having sex and it's actually I really like the relationship between these two characters.

625
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:21,214
Speaker 1: They're obviously lovers yet at the same time But he starts out like the guy seems like he's using this woman to get ahead and this woman is like his spy And he has power over her.

626
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:32,130
Speaker 1: but then very quickly it is revealed that she is also Using him and as it says so she's like yeah, I'm using you also and she has equal power over him.

627
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,763
Speaker 1: They both have power over each other and blackmail and everything and they're both relying on each other.

628
00:45:36,783 --> 00:45:39,130
Speaker 1: and it's like the most stereotypical.

629
00:45:39,355 --> 00:45:44,272
Speaker 1: Yet well done marriage or alliance of convenience But yet.

630
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:48,083
Speaker 0: Alright, so there has also an alliance of convenient evil.

631
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:49,467
Speaker 1: So they're having sex.

632
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:50,450
Speaker 1: Alright, no big deal.

633
00:45:50,510 --> 00:46:04,355
Speaker 1: There's a lot of scenes in sanctuary where two people are having sex while they talk about politics and it usually makes sense but then very shortly after there's another scene where they're in a hot tub now and they're still talking and While they don't say anything.

634
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:07,827
Speaker 1: It's so obvious that she was giving him an underwater blowjob.

635
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:08,510
Speaker 1: That is painful.

636
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:12,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I didn't need to know that you've already established that they're lovers.

637
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:16,481
Speaker 1: You've already established that there is a sexually charged relationship between these two.

638
00:46:16,923 --> 00:46:21,780
Speaker 1: You don't need to keep showing them having sex Three more times during the episode.

639
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,743
Speaker 0: I get it.

640
00:46:23,245 --> 00:46:24,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get it.

641
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:26,120
Speaker 1: Oh guru is a crazy guy.

642
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,830
Speaker 1: likes to wear his underwear and have sex with women.

643
00:46:28,131 --> 00:46:32,310
Speaker 1: I don't need to see him plowing some girl during his break in the crane more than one.

644
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:37,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, granted the fact that that girl became a little bit plotted later was kind of cool.

645
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:38,909
Speaker 0: It did redeem that scene a little bit.

646
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:44,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically they're looking for Goro because they can't find him and eventually the woman who knows about him.

647
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:44,976
Speaker 1: It's not.

648
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:54,309
Speaker 1: if you realize that it's the same woman It's not as funny But it looks like she just goes to where he works looks around sees a woman and says where's girl hanging out?

649
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,250
Speaker 1: Like she's like that woman would just know because obviously girl has had sex with that woman.

650
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:00,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

651
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:06,050
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think the thing with Moonlight Mile is that it has all the elements of a show.

652
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:14,290
Speaker 0: That should be the awesomest show but Because of the way it's done so far after watching the first two episodes, you know, I'd be willing to watch more.

653
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:15,870
Speaker 0: I might like to watch more.

654
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,057
Speaker 0: I hope that in the rest of the episodes.

655
00:47:18,097 --> 00:47:23,055
Speaker 0: it goes more towards the serious political thing that the Trailer promised.

656
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:26,590
Speaker 0: but I'm just not feeling too strongly about it.

657
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:36,070
Speaker 1: the thing is every they're set up to do everything right and If I if I'm right in assuming that the manga is actually very popular and good then my best guess is that?

658
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:46,730
Speaker 1: The people doing it are trying to establish all the backstory as quickly as possible In order to then spend as much time as they can on the meat of the show because there's obviously a lot of meat there.

659
00:47:47,172 --> 00:47:50,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I saw at least 20 volumes in the store.

660
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:55,690
Speaker 1: So yes, and the trailer alone gives you 15 or 16 solid pieces of meat that you're waiting for.

661
00:47:56,691 --> 00:47:58,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm actually.

662
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:00,870
Speaker 0: I kind of hope they bring the manga out in English.

663
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:06,566
Speaker 0: Oh, I do too cuz the next time an anime company asks what manga they should bring out in English.

664
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:07,950
Speaker 0: as for Moonlight Mile

665
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:27,787
Speaker 1: I'll also be very interested to see if and when this gets licensed because if it is as high production value or at least as Big as I'm guessing it will be in Japan Then I bet that the company involved is probably not going to want it licensed in the u.s Very quickly because that would of course entail a lot of re-importation of our cheap $20 American DVDs.

666
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:34,990
Speaker 0: The other thing is that this anime doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would be licensed in the u.s.

667
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,217
Speaker 1: And that's what I hate about living in America.

668
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:38,281
Speaker 1: all the manga.

669
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:39,284
Speaker 1: I want all the anime.

670
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:40,849
Speaker 1: I really want never come out here.

671
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:48,145
Speaker 0: Yeah They only bring out you know The same shoujo stuff and the same shonen fighting stuff that they always bring out.

672
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:50,840
Speaker 0: and they bring all that stuff out right away no matter what it is.

673
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,774
Speaker 0: and The stuff that might potentially be cool, or you know somehow Political.

674
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:03,881
Speaker 1: go to a Japanese bookstore and look in certain sections you'll see an entire wall of manga that look like they're just cool.

675
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:08,536
Speaker 1: yakuza guys talking to each other and shooting people or Politicians arguing.

676
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:16,996
Speaker 0: I saw a golf manga beat that beat that I don't know if that's quite in league with yakuza guys Looked like a serious like.

677
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:20,750
Speaker 0: you know manga for you know you know 40 year old golf players.

678
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:26,150
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, I also saw manga that was about like 50 year old people romance.

679
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:28,178
Speaker 0: You don't see the 50 year old romance.

680
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:37,010
Speaker 1: all you see is the teen romance cuz that's not gonna sell to the 14 to 14 and a half year old demographic that the manga publishers in America seem to be rooting for right now.

681
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,837
Speaker 0: Would you read the 50 year old people romance?

682
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:39,681
Speaker 1: I don't know.

683
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:40,585
Speaker 1: I might.

684
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:41,308
Speaker 1: you never know.

685
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:41,850
Speaker 1: it might be good.

686
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:45,444
Speaker 0: Has anyone ever tried to release that kind of stuff?

687
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:46,550
Speaker 1: has anyone ever tried?

688
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:49,229
Speaker 1: I mean sanctuary and eagle were both released in the u.s.

689
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:53,970
Speaker 1: And I think it's one of the greatest crimes in manga publishing in the u.s.

690
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,446
Speaker 1: To date that they have not been re-released.

691
00:49:56,889 --> 00:50:00,140
Speaker 0: well It's cuz when they originally brought anime and manga over.

692
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,293
Speaker 0: you know it's all about the violence and the sex and the oMG Japanimation.

693
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,118
Speaker 1: yeah check this out.

694
00:50:05,158 --> 00:50:07,330
Speaker 1: cartoons can be violent and horrible.

695
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:11,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean sanctuary and all that stuff was a recent originally released as comic books.

696
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:14,813
Speaker 0: the same format is all the shitty underwear perfect comics.

697
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:15,075
Speaker 0: you know.

698
00:50:15,136 --> 00:50:18,435
Speaker 0: every month another issue would come out and that's how they were sold.

699
00:50:18,455 --> 00:50:24,949
Speaker 0: they were sold in comic book stores to comic book fans in the 90s and It didn't work out so well.

700
00:50:26,071 --> 00:50:27,818
Speaker 0: And that's why they stopped doing it that way.

701
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:36,315
Speaker 0: and then when Tokyo pop and everyone started doing manga the new way they did it with the shoujo manga and things and That's what made the big money.

702
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:43,968
Speaker 0: so rather than risk it and try different genres They just stick with one the whole time, and it's kind of annoying.

703
00:50:43,988 --> 00:50:51,682
Speaker 1: yeah We talked about this yesterday with the video game industry too about how risk-averse pretty much Every industry in the world is becoming lately.

704
00:50:52,625 --> 00:51:01,486
Speaker 1: I mean it's true of video games It's true of at least American anime publishing and manga publishing yeah And it's it's pretty much turned into where you know.

705
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:05,800
Speaker 0: back in the day Nobody would think about buying something to support it.

706
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,562
Speaker 0: like that whole lot.

707
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:15,610
Speaker 0: that idea of buying something Just to you know help the company out or vote for certain sorts of products.

708
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:19,890
Speaker 0: I didn't exist like until the recent years.

709
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:21,535
Speaker 0: I never had heard that idea before.

710
00:51:22,077 --> 00:51:23,783
Speaker 0: and now it's sort of sort of like.

711
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:31,439
Speaker 0: yeah if vertical puts out a manga You should buy it because that's where the awesome manga are and if you want more awesome manga We're gonna have to buy it or else.

712
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:32,305
Speaker 0: We're not gonna get any.

713
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:35,039
Speaker 1: oh well Maybe the tide will turn for the time being.

714
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:40,370
Speaker 1: if you like that sort of thing or any of the stuff We've talked about at least check out Moonlight Mile.

715
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:47,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely worth your time to watch the trailer, and if you like the trailer It's worth it to watch the first episode.

716
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:58,383
Speaker 1: just be warned that while it may be very good, and I'm not sure yet I'll have to see pretty much the whole show to be able to pass judgment on it because I'm Really really torn as to the whole time.

717
00:51:58,443 --> 00:51:59,890
Speaker 1: I'm thinking do I like this?

718
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:02,663
Speaker 1: I like where it's going, but do I like it right now.

719
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:03,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

720
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:08,487
Speaker 0: yeah The only thing this show doesn't have is it doesn't give me that feeling that I need of.

721
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:11,722
Speaker 0: oh, yeah I just sit there, and I watch it, and I go.

722
00:52:11,742 --> 00:52:23,986
Speaker 0: I just saw everything I wanted to see but I don't have any good feelings about it, but I don't have any bad feelings either Yeah, but at the same time how few shows ever in any job anything any medium not just anime.

723
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:25,049
Speaker 1: Give us that feeling.

724
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:28,998
Speaker 1: uh All the awesome ones yeah, but there aren't that many.

725
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:30,021
Speaker 1: no there really are.

726
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:39,070
Speaker 1: it's hard to find things that really transcend any medium Or genre or whatever and become one of those shows that you remember that you want to watch again.

727
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:42,110
Speaker 1: I mean escaflowne because we mentioned it earlier.

728
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:47,594
Speaker 1: That's a show that I liked so much that I've seen it a few times and someday I plan to watch it again.

729
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:49,299
Speaker 1: Just because I enjoyed it that much.

730
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think I'll ever watch Moonlight Mile again.

731
00:52:52,913 --> 00:52:54,702
Speaker 0: I don't think so, but I'm gonna watch it once.

732
00:52:55,265 --> 00:52:56,451
Speaker 0: I might watch it once I.

733
00:52:56,612 --> 00:53:01,750
Speaker 1: I think I'm committed to watching it all the way through, but just be warned that this is not like other anime.

734
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:03,970
Speaker 1: It's not gonna look like what you expect.

735
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:06,219
Speaker 1: it's not gonna be paced the way you expect.

736
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:11,358
Speaker 1: the scenes aren't gonna be the kind of scenes you'll expect and That may or may not be a good thing.

737
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:12,343
Speaker 1: so give it a chance.

738
00:53:12,684 --> 00:53:16,015
Speaker 1: if you like this sort of thing I'm sorry There's not much more of it out there.

739
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:19,650
Speaker 1: if you hate this sort of thing go back to watching Dragon Ball Naruto bleach

740
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:33,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, and I guess this actually if you're the kind of person who listens to geek nights on Wednesday but you're not particular in the anime fan and This might be a show for you because it doesn't have a lot of the anime stereotypes

741
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:35,375
Speaker 1: in fact It has almost none of them.

742
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:39,890
Speaker 1: it has some manga stereotypes, but they're stereotypes from manga that many of you've never read.

743
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:46,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it doesn't matter like hey Everybody's getting drunk, and then they draw a red line across their face and stuff like that.

744
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,882
Speaker 1: It's stuff that you're not gonna notice it.

745
00:53:48,902 --> 00:53:49,525
Speaker 1: You're not gonna see.

746
00:53:49,545 --> 00:53:52,655
