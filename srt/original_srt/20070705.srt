00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,988
Speaker 1: It's Thursday July 5th.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,152
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:15,458
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:16,674
Speaker 1: fire.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,376
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:31,646
Speaker 0: Man, this week is just swinging with anecdotes.

7
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:36,401
Speaker 0: I Ran a foul of a low-class person on my way home from work today.

8
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:41,688
Speaker 0: that ended mostly in hilarity and possibly also in police action.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,150
Speaker 0: Okay, so I'm riding my bike, you know, I get off the train I get on my bike and I brought my bike back home.

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,065
Speaker 0: It takes like 10 minutes to ride my maybe 15 minutes if I'm not in a hurry.

11
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:58,770
Speaker 0: and while I'm riding I'm riding in the street like you do on a bike because it's actually illegal to ride bikes on the sidewalk here.

12
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's illegal to ride bikes on the sidewalk almost everywhere.

13
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you're a little kid.

14
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:08,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm riding and This guy comes up behind me and he guns his engine.

15
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:23,749
Speaker 0: Alright, I have my hand out already because I'm signaling I'm about to turn left and I turn left and for some reason he suddenly like slams on his brakes And almost like spins out like yeah right behind me like yeah, uh-huh, and he almost hits me.

16
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:31,923
Speaker 0: So I say hey watch where you're going and I keep riding and then I hear some sort of Garbled scream from behind me as I'm riding.

17
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:33,369
Speaker 0: I hear the engine in.

18
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,550
Speaker 0: He bumps into the curb as he's trying to do a k-turn on this narrow two-lane road.

19
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:41,789
Speaker 0: He eventually turns around and proceeds to start chasing me in his car.

20
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:43,689
Speaker 1: All right.

21
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:55,390
Speaker 0: So, uh at this point I get up on the sidewalk on my bike and I keep going and he rolled out in his window And he keeps driving and the stream of profanity that is coming out of his mouth.

22
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,195
Speaker 0: Basically, he's yelling.

23
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:01,247
Speaker 0: fucking bicycle faggot fucking in my way fucking stop that bike.

24
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,720
Speaker 0: I'll kick your fucking ass Son of a fuck fuck fuck.

25
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a question.

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:15,290
Speaker 1: All right If you if there was if it was legal to have a concealed weapon in this state And you had all the necessary paperwork would have been legal to like shoot his tire or something?

27
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,289
Speaker 0: No, you can't just take a revenge.

28
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:20,906
Speaker 0: No unless if I could make a case that he was coming at me with the car.

29
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,404
Speaker 0: then Shooting the tire is the best non-lethal way of preventing them from killing me.

30
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:26,448
Speaker 1: Well, were there any witnesses?

31
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:27,030
Speaker 0: not yet.

32
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,981
Speaker 1: So you could have said he was coming at you with the car.

33
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:29,463
Speaker 0: No.

34
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:30,187
Speaker 0: No, it gets better.

35
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:40,608
Speaker 0: Okay So he starts yelling and yelling and I'm up on the curb and I stopped for a second and he stops and he Opens the door of his car to come and beat me up.

36
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:49,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, I just started biking again and this 30 whatever year old guy the guy was in his mid 30s at least Obviously can't catch me.

37
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:53,772
Speaker 0: so he gets back in his car and starts chasing me and the whole time I realize now All right.

38
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:54,776
Speaker 0: This guy's gonna follow me.

39
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:58,089
Speaker 0: I wonder if he realizes that bikes can go places cars can't go.

40
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:01,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder if he's thought his clever plan all the way through.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,830
Speaker 0: obviously not never mind the fact that I've already got his license plate.

42
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,657
Speaker 0: I took a picture of it with my cell cam.

43
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:09,870
Speaker 0: Ah, I took a picture of him with my cell cam and his car.

44
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:26,270
Speaker 0: I'm sitting there and I just start riding and he's following me the whole time yelling and screaming out the window and he keeps making like he gets ahead of me and then he stops to try to get out of his car and come fight With me and I just avoid him and keep biking and he's getting very very perturbed.

45
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,345
Speaker 0: So finally I just stopped and I hold my cell phone up and I say dude.

46
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:30,947
Speaker 0: I'm about to call 9-1-1.

47
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,770
Speaker 1: Yep, what do you say now here?

48
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,612
Speaker 0: This is the test.

49
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:36,719
Speaker 0: see this test for me was the test of.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,270
Speaker 0: is this person stupid independent of all of his other problems?

51
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,119
Speaker 0: And he says that don't fucking matter.

52
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,344
Speaker 0: I know all the police and beacon.

53
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,308
Speaker 0: they won't lay a hand on me.

54
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:45,730
Speaker 0: come over here.

55
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,868
Speaker 0: I'll kick your faggot ass.

56
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,197
Speaker 1: Call the police and beacon now.

57
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:50,623
Speaker 0: I wasn't gonna call 9-1-1 yet.

58
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:52,470
Speaker 0: I was just gonna file a deposition later.

59
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,340
Speaker 0: I'm already dealing with the police aspect of this.

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,909
Speaker 0: cuz I already has license plate number.

61
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:02,870
Speaker 0: So I basically and I said, uh, I don't think that's gonna help you and I'm just I want to see how he reacts.

62
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,100
Speaker 0: Cuz there's nothing he can do to me.

63
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,129
Speaker 0: He can't get me.

64
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:13,020
Speaker 0: he obviously doesn't have a gun or anything because he's at the point where he already would have used it and I kind of want to see where this goes because

65
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,961
Speaker 1: I would have let him attack you and then kicked his ass cuz Self-defense I was and then the police would have come and wasn't

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,769
Speaker 0: really in the mood to get into a fight with someone plus remember No witnesses at this point.

67
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,799
Speaker 1: You got to go somewhere with his witnesses and then let him attack you.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,225
Speaker 0: so I just keep riding and he's following me obviously Until I go to the ice cream shop or something following me home now.

69
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:33,270
Speaker 0: I cut around the other street.

70
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,141
Speaker 0: This is on for plank.

71
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:38,907
Speaker 0: Uh-huh So I just kind of keep going and I go onto our street and I go past our house.

72
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,394
Speaker 0: cuz I don't want to lead Him to my house.

73
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:41,722
Speaker 0: I'll get to why in a minute.

74
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Finally, there's a gas station.

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,850
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of people filling up their gas.

76
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:54,199
Speaker 0: So I just stopped my bike there and he pulls up yelling and cursing and gets out Completely oblivious to all these people staring at him.

77
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,285
Speaker 0: and he's yelling and screaming at me.

78
00:04:56,746 --> 00:05:01,530
Speaker 0: and every time he comes forward I just kind of backed my bike up a little bit because there's no way he could catch me.

79
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:06,557
Speaker 0: There's no way he could even close the distance and He keeps yelling.

80
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,273
Speaker 0: You're gonna disrespect me on my face You're gonna.

81
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,096
Speaker 0: you're gonna come get me.

82
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:16,504
Speaker 0: then he's yelling and yelling and yelling and I'm just sitting there and at this point One more time I say dude and this time I lied.

83
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:17,730
Speaker 0: I will admit I lied at this point.

84
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,936
Speaker 0: I said and I quote dude I already called the police.

85
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:22,523
Speaker 0: I've got your license plate number.

86
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:24,170
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of people are watching you.

87
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:26,177
Speaker 0: What do you think you're gonna get away with?

88
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,385
Speaker 0: and he says I'll kick your ass.

89
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,510
Speaker 0: They can't lay a hand on me.

90
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,915
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna kill you.

91
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:31,919
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go to jail.

92
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:37,369
Speaker 0: But but I'll kick your ass to which I say You know if you kick my ass, you'll go to jail, right?

93
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,961
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's called assault.

94
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,456
Speaker 0: And as long as He's already committed assault.

95
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:43,837
Speaker 1: Well, I know.

96
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:49,243
Speaker 1: but like if when the police come they ask you they ask rim Do you want to press charges?

97
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:51,527
Speaker 1: and if you say yes, he goes to jail.

98
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:52,990
Speaker 0: so he's still freaking out.

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,649
Speaker 0: He's not backing down the threat of the police isn't scaring him at all.

100
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:00,029
Speaker 0: I'll get to why this is all relevant in the end because there is a lesson to be learned from all this.

101
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,874
Speaker 1: Don't be stupid.

102
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,223
Speaker 0: So at this point because I don't care anymore.

103
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:13,655
Speaker 0: I just started laughing Openly and loudly and he gets so like the fury in his eyes is palpable You can feel it.

104
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:19,988
Speaker 0: and he keeps taking a step forward like yeah, like he's gonna come get me but I'm on a bike and he can't come get me.

105
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:27,372
Speaker 0: and Eventually, I just keep laughing at him and I just keep laughing and laughing and laughing and eventually gets back in his car And yells.

106
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:37,280
Speaker 0: if you weren't such a pussy fucking faggot, maybe you would have stood up to me like a man Uh-huh to which I said and I said something about.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,960
Speaker 0: basically I implied that maybe I am homosexual and maybe I find you attractive And then he drove away.

108
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:52,735
Speaker 0: I took one more picture of his car yeah, and then I stood there and there's all these people standing around at the gas station looking like what the hell and One of them's like.

109
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,304
Speaker 0: do you actually call the police?

110
00:06:54,625 --> 00:07:03,579
Speaker 0: and I'm like nah Okay The police know I already filed a police report.

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,754
Speaker 1: All right, and I think you rode your bike to the police station And no, I just called him.

112
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:10,747
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give him a full deposition called the non 9-1-1 police.

113
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:11,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, what is the?

114
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:13,835
Speaker 0: Looked it up again.

115
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:14,480
Speaker 0: I got it myself.

116
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:15,790
Speaker 0: I had it my old cell phone.

117
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,958
Speaker 0: Remember when we saw that guy cutting up?

118
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:21,050
Speaker 1: we really need one of those like seven one ones in New York.

119
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,770
Speaker 1: So, you know that we can call when we don't need nine one one, but we need some police.

120
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:34,430
Speaker 0: Well, I just put the local police for like beacon and fish kill in my cell phone and everyone else I would have rode all the way to the fish kill police station and just like stood there be like, what are you gonna do?

121
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fish kill one's nice.

122
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,649
Speaker 0: It's a lot of cops there.

123
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:40,690
Speaker 1: Apparently the fish kill police station is the envy of all the other police station.

124
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:41,775
Speaker 0: I wonder why.

125
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,386
Speaker 0: fish kill is a relatively small town.

126
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:49,830
Speaker 0: It's not a city like beacon It's just a town and it is my impression now my impression.

127
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,099
Speaker 0: This is not a fact because I have not researched it.

128
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,665
Speaker 1: However, I research it.

129
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:54,990
Speaker 1: I read a newspaper article about it.

130
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:55,473
Speaker 1: Well,

131
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:21,282
Speaker 0: I get the impression It is my opinion that possibly the reason fish kill has one of the best police Buildings and the finest police forces with the best cars and the most money pretty much in the tri-county area here might have something to do with the fact that fish kills a big town on one side of the street called route 9 and then there's a little bit of fish kill on the other side of route 9 and I think that the city of fish get.

132
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:27,543
Speaker 0: well the town of fish kill Writes more tickets on that tiny stretch of route 9 over which they have control.

133
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:30,110
Speaker 0: then could possibly be reasonable.

134
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,336
Speaker 0: That's my guess.

135
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's where they get their money.

136
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:42,350
Speaker 1: But the fish kill police department is probably the largest Municipal building in this area outside of the actual city of Poughkeepsie.

137
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,219
Speaker 1: It's bigger than any town hall of any of these towns.

138
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:48,569
Speaker 0: It's bigger than beacons police department City Hall combined.

139
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,619
Speaker 1: Yep It's got like a gym and all sorts of stuff in there.

140
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,341
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

141
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,224
Speaker 0: They have more.

142
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:54,950
Speaker 0: they have so many police cars.

143
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:56,199
Speaker 1: It's kind of crazy.

144
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,542
Speaker 1: All right.

145
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:08,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Lesson number one and I think I mentioned this back when I explained how to Not that I recommend it run away from the police and the answer was pretty much be on a bicycle.

146
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:12,285
Speaker 0: This applies even more so to non police.

147
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:22,877
Speaker 0: if you're on a bicycle There is almost no way that any human being who is not also on a bicycle can cause harm to you if you're smart Because bikes can go where cars can't go.

148
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:27,349
Speaker 0: bikes can turn quicker bikes can go faster than anyone can run for longer.

149
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,190
Speaker 1: A bicycle is the most efficient means of transportation.

150
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:32,293
Speaker 1: Period.

151
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,190
Speaker 0: well that is in short bursts to get away from an attacker.

152
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,737
Speaker 1: well I know but in general it also is the most of it.

153
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:49,710
Speaker 1: a geared bicycle is the most efficient means of transportation in terms of energy per going and So it's really tough for anyone to beat you as long unless their bike is better than yours and their own land.

154
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,467
Speaker 0: I've learned something else too.

155
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:57,170
Speaker 0: Generally, if someone is a costing you odds are they're not in the best shape and they're definitely not a biker.

156
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,239
Speaker 1: That's also probably true.

157
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,630
Speaker 1: They could be some asshole biker.

158
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:06,412
Speaker 0: Yeah But an asshole biker is usually the kind of guy who kicks the in like the door of an SUV when they cut him off Or something.

159
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:11,549
Speaker 0: those aren't the people who will chase another biker down and try to kick his pussy faggot ass, huh?

160
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,717
Speaker 0: Moral number two and this is the reason why while I'm filing a police report I am not going to press charges.

161
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:30,490
Speaker 0: and I learned this because I lived in Detroit for a long time and I lived in New Baltimore which is a nice town, but there was also a lot of Shall we say trashy people and then I lived in a really nice area and I've moved around a lot.

162
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:41,895
Speaker 0: But whenever you are involved in any sort of altercation with someone who is now this is an ant they have to be both very poor and Very stupid.

163
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:42,739
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:57,770
Speaker 0: Oh one of these factors alone is not enough but if both of these are true unless you have a good reason to you don't want to get involved no matter what because if someone is poor and Stupid let's take the example of this gentleman.

165
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,115
Speaker 0: He's obviously poor.

166
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,280
Speaker 0: It was a pretty crappy car.

167
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:03,752
Speaker 0: He was wearing this battered white shirt with sweat stains on it.

168
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:10,000
Speaker 0: He didn't look like the most well-off guy Mm-hmm and his addiction manner of speech the vocabulary he used.

169
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:16,179
Speaker 0: I have a pretty good picture of his the social class in which he lies Mm-hmm, so he doesn't have much to lose.

170
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,727
Speaker 0: There's not much you can do to him.

171
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,040
Speaker 1: besides if you're not gonna get jailed and what are you gonna get?

172
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,608
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get money from suing him.

173
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,760
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get damages or anything.

174
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:28,535
Speaker 1: It's pretty much jail for him or no jail for him.

175
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,684
Speaker 0: more importantly He is stupid.

176
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:38,046
Speaker 0: notice how despite the fact that I could have called the police and that there were multiple witnesses Watching this exchange.

177
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:50,425
Speaker 0: He still continued to escalate the situation Obviously either not caring or unaware of the possible consequences of attacking a person in broad daylight with a video camera a cell cam and several Witnesses.

178
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,188
Speaker 1: if the police are on their way I'm sure the gas station also had some security cam.

179
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,051
Speaker 0: That's what I actually.

180
00:11:55,111 --> 00:11:57,340
Speaker 0: I made a point of being right where the camera was pointed.

181
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:59,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you can never tell those little black domes.

182
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:00,636
Speaker 1: They could be looking at.

183
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,122
Speaker 0: it's not a black dome It's just a camera.

184
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:03,946
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

185
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:06,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, so obvious now.

186
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:20,480
Speaker 0: people like this because I have many anecdotes from my childhood where someone would you know call the police on a poor and stupid person in town and The poor and stupid person having nothing to lose and not being afraid of the ramifications would often retaliate.

187
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:31,250
Speaker 0: They'll do things like figure out where someone live and then Key their car up one night in the middle of the night or egg their house or let the air out of their tires or smash The windows or stalk them or things like that.

188
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,599
Speaker 0: get their friends to attack them in an alley one night.

189
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:42,399
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm poor people who are also stupid are not afraid of the consequences of their actions partly because they seem to be ignorant of the Consequences of their actions or they have nothing to lose.

190
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:51,570
Speaker 0: So I'm so your best bet when dealing with the situation like I've described where you're in no danger is not to press charges But to simply file a police report.

191
00:12:52,053 --> 00:13:01,859
Speaker 0: that way it's on file And if you ever run afoul of them again And they cause trouble You've already got it on record that they've accosted you before and now the book will get thrown at him twice as hard.

192
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:12,803
Speaker 1: Yeah Still it kind of makes you realize You know as much as we look down upon police brutality and not about to change that opinion that is one You know.

193
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,959
Speaker 1: poor stupid people have nothing to lose.

194
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,479
Speaker 1: One thing they have to lose is getting the shit beat out of them.

195
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:22,092
Speaker 1: You know, that's sometimes, you know, I mean putting him in jail.

196
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,320
Speaker 1: they don't care, you know, they probably care.

197
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,480
Speaker 0: The problem is they don't expect that they'll actually go to jail.

198
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:33,183
Speaker 0: The guy kept going on and on while he was yelling about how he knows all the police in this town and they won't lay A hand on it.

199
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,328
Speaker 1: So you should have gone to fish kill.

200
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,760
Speaker 1: Yeah been like we're a fish kill now.

201
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,728
Speaker 0: Well, actually no cuz.

202
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:41,939
Speaker 0: when he said that I was like, ah, dude I called 9-1-1. the state troopers are coming not the local police.

203
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:46,354
Speaker 0: And he stopped for a second and he just ignored that and said it doesn't matter.

204
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,017
Speaker 0: I know them too.

205
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,888
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I'm sure dude.

206
00:13:49,231 --> 00:13:57,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure Yeah, so when running afoul of people who are both plus I'm sure if you know Even if I was Fred like a fireman and I was friends all of the cops.

207
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,659
Speaker 1: I'm sure they wouldn't, you know, put me in jail if I beat someone up.

208
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:12,460
Speaker 0: I also note that I will admit I got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this and I probably could have just gotten away Quicker, but I kind of wanted to see what he would do.

209
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:18,379
Speaker 0: So I just kept laughing at him and he just kept getting more angry Yeah, and I wish I could have had a video of it.

210
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,759
Speaker 0: Maybe I should go ask the gas station guy if he'll give it to me.

211
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,168
Speaker 1: This is actually a lot more fun.

212
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,820
Speaker 1: if it happens in like New York City or something Right, cuz like the police will already be there kicking his ass.

213
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,756
Speaker 0: Well, not only not only that but

214
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:45,960
Speaker 1: you know If you're walking down the street and like someone starts something like let's say someone tries to mug you or take your wallet or something Right, and there's actually other people around who are not accomplices of them About half those people are gonna help you out and there's gonna be basically a huge beatdown of like five on one.

215
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,360
Speaker 0: It's like when you were there and that purse snatcher tried to grab them.

216
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was walking to work.

217
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,000
Speaker 1: I think we talked to me talk about this on the show years ago.

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,939
Speaker 1: We can tell it briefly a long time ago like a year two years more than two years ago When I worked in the different part of the city at the old job.

219
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,916
Speaker 1: I was walking to work one day from Grand Central to the work and I passed well.

220
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:14,900
Speaker 1: walking by the Think the south side of Bryant Park and on the other side of the street I hear a scream and I see some guy trying to grab a giant purse from this lady.

221
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:16,409
Speaker 0: I don't get those giant purses.

222
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,355
Speaker 1: Well, I don't get it either.

223
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,080
Speaker 1: What are you carrying?

224
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:34,239
Speaker 1: I don't know, but he grabs it and he starts to run and he gets about two parking spaces away and I'm like, huh and then I'm gonna go run across the street and Meanwhile three other guys on the other side of the street already grabbed him and beat him up.

225
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:37,774
Speaker 0: Basically a crowd of like all the people who got there after he was beat up or like.

226
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:38,778
Speaker 0: is it under control?

227
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:43,080
Speaker 0: you got him You got him like everyone in New York City will just jump on something like that.

228
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:50,386
Speaker 1: Yeah And then a one policeman shows up and puts handcuffs on him and they make sure the guy doesn't get up like stands on him Or something, I guess I don't know.

229
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,519
Speaker 1: and then everyone stands around while he writes a report.

230
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:56,098
Speaker 1: Then I go to work.

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that was my day.

232
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:01,699

Speaker 1: a counsel is a different kind of lawyer, whatever.

241
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:38,254
Speaker 1: I'm sure all of our lawyer listeners will know he was the lawyer for Steve Jackson in the Steve Jackson versus United States Secret Service case.

242
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:39,880
Speaker 1: Oh and Steve Jackson one.

243
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:44,774
Speaker 0: Uh, I just like to note that if any of you are unfamiliar with that court case You should look it up.

244
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:49,495
Speaker 0: Anytime you think that our government the United States government is capable

245
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:51,040
Speaker 1: of an intelligent conspiracy

246
00:16:51,282 --> 00:17:03,040
Speaker 0: yeah, if any time you think that the government is evil and Conspiring to do evil things and like the secret government the shadow, whatever That story will remind you very quickly that it is probably not the case.

Speaker 1: Yep, he then became a lawyer for the electronic frontier foundation, which is awesome.

248
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:16,180
Speaker 1: They're the people who have a bunch of lawyers who are fighting to you know Get rid of all these stupid laws like the DMCA actually legal wiretapping.

249
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:16,682
Speaker 1: they were

250
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:33,820
Speaker 0: largely behind the blue ribbon campaign, which is a part of internet history now, but Basically back when the internet started really taking off in the mid 90s The idea of freedom of speech on the internet was sharply contested in the United States and there was a large Campaign to make sure that we had freedom of speech there.

251
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,320
Speaker 1: Yep, the EFF's major contribution has been that they got they won the case that lets us all use very powerful encryption.

252
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:47,560
Speaker 1: He also wrote a bunch of books and the character Mike Godwin that a difference engine is named after Godwin.

253
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,286
Speaker 0: Yep, that was the Zimmerman case.

254
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,210
Speaker 0: right the encryption thing.

255
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:51,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.

256
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:55,052
Speaker 0: I don't remember exactly I don't remember offhand.

257
00:17:55,334 --> 00:18:13,908
Speaker 1: Yep, and then Alright, so then he came up with Godwin's law Which is and I state ahem as an online discussion grows longer the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler Approaches one that is Godwin's law.

258
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,192
Speaker 1: and he came up with it.

259
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:15,693
Speaker 1: note.

260
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,160
Speaker 0: It does not say anyone loses an argument.

261
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,873
Speaker 0: It just says that Hitler's gonna come up.

262
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:21,455

00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,400
Speaker 1: He's awesome, right?

284
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,832
Speaker 0: So the 4th of July Independence Day in the United States went by.

285
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:23,940
Speaker 0: it's part of the reason we had a special yesterday.

286
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:31,800
Speaker 0: also to all of you who are relatively new I would like to Teach you about some of the code words we use on geek nights.

287
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:40,539
Speaker 0: You see whenever we call a show a special episode that is code word for and I quote Raymond Scott are too lazy to do an actual show.

288
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:43,953
Speaker 0: So they're just gonna record something and put it up and call it special.

289
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,476
Speaker 1: That's exactly right Hahaha.

290
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:55,569
Speaker 0: but anyway apparently the state of Minnesota there is a law that they want to pass.

291
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:56,753
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's passed yet or what.

292
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:58,860
Speaker 0: I read this article very skim ishly.

293
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 0: Basically, they want to make it illegal to sell flags American flags within the state that were not produced in the United States Punishable by up to a thousand dollar fine and 90 days in jail.

294
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,744
Speaker 0: No, no, no Or anything.

295
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:23,020
Speaker 0: I would like to point out that that is in violation of a great many international trade treaties.

296
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:36,787
Speaker 1: well I was gonna say it's in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America because if it's a flag from another country then it's interstate commerce and thus the federal government has Purvey over that.

297
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,092
Speaker 1: I guess not mistake.

298
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:38,816
Speaker 0: I guess they could.

299
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:44,160
Speaker 0: they could make the argument I guess that because it they don't want them to be sold within the state.

300
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,216
Speaker 0: So they're not interacting with the feds because it can come in the borders.

301
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:49,120
Speaker 0: You just can't be sold.

302
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,714
Speaker 1: I guess I could order one from another state.

303
00:20:51,774 --> 00:20:52,880
Speaker 1: Then what are they gonna do about it?

304
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,509
Speaker 1: I'll order a thousand of them from oriental trading company.

305
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,908
Speaker 0: See now, uh, I just want to point out that Minnesota Loses a little bit of the respect.

306
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, Minnesota never had much of the respect any.

307
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,947
Speaker 1: I mean, what the hell does that state have now?

308
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:07,600
Speaker 0: I've seen that there are a lot of other states that have similar laws.

309
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:16,147
Speaker 0: However on further investigation, it looks like most of those laws Don't say you can't sell Nondomestically produced flags in the state.

310
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:21,250
Speaker 0: They say these states cannot buy Nondomestically produced which is very different.

311
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:21,933
Speaker 0: No, that's it.

312
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:23,440
Speaker 1: You can you can have a law like that.

313
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,940
Speaker 1: I'm that's a law that says this is how the state will spend its taxpayer money.

314
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is there's nothing wrong with that kind of law.

315
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,818
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with that, but I just can't believe that then in this day and age this sort of jingoist restrictive trade bullshit still happens.

316
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:45,937
Speaker 0: I mean Globalization works only if it's actually global and it's actually free.

317
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:48,547
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot It's a people always complain.

318
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:53,980
Speaker 1: you see all those people protesting the World Trade Organization and stuff And they're kind of right in the kind of wrong.

319
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,093
Speaker 1: The problem here is that the World Trade Organization wants.

320
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:58,740
Speaker 1: quote free trade, right?

321
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:07,720
Speaker 1: Free trade on paper means that anyone in the entire world right can trade Absolutely freely with anyone else in the entire world.

322
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,380
Speaker 1: I can engage in commerce with a Chinese guy and not have to pay any government's extra money.

323
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:24,180
Speaker 1: It'll just be money goes from me to the Chinese guy and goods come from him to me or vice versa And no one gets in the way except of course you have to pay for someone to ship it, but that's it.

324
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,505
Speaker 1: That's what free trade means is.

325
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:35,519
Speaker 1: anyone can do business with anyone perfectly openly with no interference Of course, as long as you're not doing illegal business Like I don't know buying guns or bombs or anything like that.

326
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:39,000
Speaker 1: The problem is is that the World Trade Organization actually?

327
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:48,851
Speaker 1: fights so that big companies and federal governments can trade freely but individual people Cannot and thus it won't work if you do that.

328
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:51,219
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is it's a little more complicated.

329
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:51,540
Speaker 1: it is.

330
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,658
Speaker 1: I'm trying to keep it simple here.

331
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,745
Speaker 1: I can not let her episode.

332
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,292
Speaker 0: I can sum it up much more simply.

333
00:22:55,312 --> 00:23:07,371
Speaker 0: the majority of the people Protesting the WTO or the World Bank or all those things have no idea what those organizations even do and they're just dirty hippies For some reason have jumped on the ravel bandwagon.

334
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:08,575
Speaker 1: Thanks for saying what I was thinking.

335
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:10,040
Speaker 0: I've talked to these people.

336
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,692
Speaker 0: I've read what they wrote on the internet unless they're anarcho primitivists.

337
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:15,699
Speaker 1: Uh, you mean like the Unabomber?

338
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:18,467
Speaker 0: Yeah No, no, cuz he was actually he.

339
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:22,480
Speaker 0: while he was a crazy nut at least he was not an anarcho primitivist.

340
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,660
Speaker 0: He went all the way with his anarcho primitivism.

341
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:29,580
Speaker 0: Okay, it was Emily who knew someone who met a guy who claimed to be an anarcho primitivist.

342
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,385
Speaker 0: So we basically.

343
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:40,879
Speaker 0: what that meant was he didn't have any furniture in his dorm room except for his laptop where he Yeah, he would go on forums and talk about anarcho primitivism something like that.

344
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,560
Speaker 0: Yeah But I've tried to talk to these people before and they don't even know what the or what these acronyms stand for.

345
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:53,898
Speaker 1: These people are idiots Yeah, but anyway free trade is good as long as everyone gets free trade.

346
00:23:53,978 --> 00:24:01,060
Speaker 1: and it's funny How we have a federal government fighting for free trade while some of the states are doing the exact opposite.

347
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:03,848
Speaker 0: Well, it's just BS jingoism and hopefully I'm.

348
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,820
Speaker 0: there's a possibility that this bill was just put forth by some guy.

349
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,586
Speaker 0: He wants to rabble rouse the jingoism.

350
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:22,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean state legislatures aren't full of you know, all awesome people, you know You don't have to be some great Legislator to get on to the state, you know, you can simplify that regular expression and just define something legislators.

351
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,498
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I could.

352
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:38,035
Speaker 0: Things of the day, you know Scott I got to say off Billy Jean, she's not my lover She's just the girl.

353
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:46,110
Speaker 0: said that I'm the one but kids not my son Uh-huh, so apparently well not apparently I just I found a video of it.

354
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,795
Speaker 0: So I want to share this with all of you.

355
00:24:48,457 --> 00:25:04,728
Speaker 0: Michael Jackson first performed his classic trademark moonwalk in 1983 on a television special called Motown 25 Yesterday today forever and here's a video of it and all I got to say one the moonwalks.

356
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:05,370
Speaker 0: awesome, too.

357
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,864
Speaker 0: I'm glad that I can see the first time it happened.

358
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:08,769
Speaker 0: and three.

359
00:25:09,472 --> 00:25:14,266
Speaker 1: Michael Jackson was so cool back then and now he's the exact opposite.

360
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,590
Speaker 1: How the fuck does that happen?

361
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:18,210
Speaker 0: I mean when I was a kid, I was a huge fan of Michael Jackson.

362
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:21,063
Speaker 0: I got to say now that I'm it's kind of like with MC hammer.

363
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:28,721
Speaker 0: now that I'm older and It's in the past and I go back and watch this dancing in the singing I'm so much more impressed by it.

364
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:38,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess when I was a kid I just didn't appreciate awesome dancing, even though I still liked MC hammer and Michael Jackson as a kid I didn't really appreciate their talents or former talents.

365
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:45,290
Speaker 1: And now I go back and look at it again and unlike he-man which now looks like crap don't watch he-man.

366
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:48,707
Speaker 1: I look back at Michael Jackson MC hammer and other.

367
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,608
Speaker 1: you know Things I enjoyed as a kid and some of them are more awesome now than they used to be.

368
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:55,799
Speaker 1: of course Some of the people are less awesome now than they used to be.

369
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:02,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, but seriously Michael Jackson was awesome was Yeah was if only he hadn't gone crazy.

370
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:03,805
Speaker 1: How does this happen?

371
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:04,567
Speaker 1: I mean like look at us.

372
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:07,979
Speaker 1: We're kind of cool We're not famous, but we're internet famous.

373
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely think we crossed the line of internet fame, right?

374
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:12,969
Speaker 1: How could we possibly?

375
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,404
Speaker 1: Become like that like how could we take a downturn like that?

376
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:20,034
Speaker 1: I just don't see a possible Path.

377
00:26:20,134 --> 00:26:22,890
Speaker 1: I could go down where that would be the end up like that.

378
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:25,550
Speaker 0: Well part of it might be that we weren't child stars.

379
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,783
Speaker 0: We weren't internet famous before we could handle being internet famous.

380
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:30,530
Speaker 1: I guess that is significant factor.

381
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:39,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, also the fact that there was a lot of pressure on kid Michael Jackson And he was you know pretty much the biggest pop star in the world.

382
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:41,450
Speaker 1: I mean like what about kid Tiger Woods?

383
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,134
Speaker 1: He's alright.

384
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:47,668
Speaker 0: He doesn't have a problem now I guess I mean it also depends on the person the family all those sorts of things.

385
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:49,696
Speaker 0: Yeah But I do agree.

386
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,930
Speaker 0: I can't see us going crazy and mad with power.

387
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:55,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean next year when geek nights has a hundred thousand listeners.

388
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:58,250
Speaker 0: I Don't see my life changing.

389
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,772
Speaker 0: Anyway anyway.

390
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:08,507
Speaker 1: so This moonwalk that Michael Jackson did did he invent it?

391
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:09,110
Speaker 0: well?

392
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,522
Speaker 0: You see there's a lot of information about this.

393
00:27:11,603 --> 00:27:19,128
Speaker 0: if you really want to go read the Wikipedia Now I cuz I actually didn't know that Part of it was based on some of the things that Marcel Marcel used to do back in the 50s.

394
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,250
Speaker 0: If you don't know who that is get off my podcast Yep.

395
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:31,570
Speaker 0: But as far as I can see and this is also on YouTube the first moonwalk was before that was videotaped Was performed by well?

396
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,786
Speaker 0: I'll just let Scott take it from here because it's a thing of the day is my thing today.

397
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:42,630
Speaker 1: so in 1955 there was a tap dancing guy, and he was an awesome tap dancing guy, and you know I like some old-style dancing.

398
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,848
Speaker 1: I've done old-style dancing things of the day before and this is a guy named Bill Bailey.

399
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:47,290
Speaker 0: dude Scott.

400
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,103
Speaker 0: I'll randomly watch the Charleston while we're waiting to do that.

401
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:53,910
Speaker 1: one of my favorite things to do is that People doing the Charleston is just so awesome.

402
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:54,895
Speaker 1: Why don't we?

403
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:58,070
Speaker 1: I just look on YouTube to find people doing the Charleston all the time.

404
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,275
Speaker 0: Why don't we do the Charleston?

405
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:00,279
Speaker 1: It's hard.

406
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:00,881
Speaker 0: Let's learn it.

407
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:02,889
Speaker 1: We have to learn other dances first.

408
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,598
Speaker 1: No not like the Haruhi Susan me dance.

409
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,983
Speaker 0: so which one should we learn first?

410
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:09,927
Speaker 0: that or the Charleston?

411
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:16,890
Speaker 1: we have to learn like Basic dance moves that you know you like fundamental parts that we can add together into the Charleston.

412
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,890
Speaker 0: Why don't we just Napoleon dynamite it?

413
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,593
Speaker 0: Let's just get every music video Michael Jackson ever did and learn the poppin lock straight up Cuz.

414
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,644
Speaker 1: then we're only gonna be able to do that one dance.

415
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:27,550
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with that.

416
00:28:27,731 --> 00:28:28,616
Speaker 0: If we learn ever.

417
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:39,370
Speaker 1: if we learn the parts of dances Then we can recombine them later to construct new dances Sort of like learning to fish rather than being given a fish kind of like when you're playing DDR.

418
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:47,057
Speaker 0: I mean you might be able to do the up left down left combo and the up right down left combo But if you can combine the two without screwing it up.

419
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,564
Speaker 1: yep, so anyway this tap dancing.

420
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:57,164
Speaker 1: Bill Bailey regardless of anything else You should watch this because awesome old tap dancing can't be beat, but at the end of this video.

421
00:28:57,184 --> 00:29:03,822
Speaker 1: He moonwalks oh my god 1955 there's a dude moonwalking after he's done tap dancing.

422
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,330
Speaker 0: I don't doubt that Michael Jackson saw that video.

423
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,022
Speaker 1: I also do not doubt that he saw that video lightning.

424
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,709
Speaker 0: huh, maybe we should get the show short.

425
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:11,414
Speaker 1: no That's all right.

426
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:12,888
Speaker 0: well the power did go out earlier.

427
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:13,532
Speaker 0: luckily We have.

428
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:14,537
Speaker 0: we have UPS's.

429
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,004
Speaker 0: we have four UPS's.

430
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:20,085
Speaker 1: see if the power goes out You just go save and then exit and turn the computer off.

431
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:24,070
Speaker 0: yep actually We could still upload the show even if the power was out.

432
00:29:24,214 --> 00:29:26,277
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah We could send it over to my computer.

433
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:29,830
Speaker 0: well our network equipment is all on the UPS in addition to all our computers.

434
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:36,882
Speaker 1: Yeah If you if you sent it over to my laptop really quickly my laptop on its battery power could connect to the wireless router And then we could upload the show.

435
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:52,213
Speaker 0: yep Now listening to that song I'm sure you could guess as what we're talking about tonight Even though it could be any number of things.

436
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,326
Speaker 0: perhaps We're talking about that style of music perhaps.

437
00:29:55,346 --> 00:30:00,620
Speaker 0: We're talking about that song, but now we're talking about the subject of that song.

438
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:07,960
Speaker 0: Tonight we are beginning a long-running series on perhaps Scott's favorite thing in the world some of my favorite thing in the world.

439
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,200
Speaker 0: It's it's probably your second most said word yeah, but that doesn't mean it's my favorite thing.

440
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,599
Speaker 1: Just cuz I say something a lot doesn't mean it's my favorite.

441
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:17,066
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

442
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:20,600
Speaker 0: so you saying Scott that the topic of our show is not your favorite thing.

443
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:21,847
Speaker 1: No, it's not my favorite thing.

444
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:22,832
Speaker 0: is it in the top three?

445
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:23,958
Speaker 0: probably okay?

446
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,407
Speaker 0: Tonight we're gonna talk about fire.

447
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:30,819
Speaker 0: we entitle this episode fire part one.

448
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,894
Speaker 0: oh I figured you'd take it away from there Scott captain fire.

449
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:39,299
Speaker 1: Oh Anyway fire is pretty goddamn awesome.

450
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,386
Speaker 1: You get you.

451
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:50,879
Speaker 1: just if you start a fire you get light you get heat you get danger You get a weapon you get a tool.

452
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,027
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard to beat fire.

453
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:54,592
Speaker 1: even cavemen knew that much.

454
00:30:55,074 --> 00:31:03,733
Speaker 1: the thing is actually that Most animals at least on earth seem to be afraid of fire Which you think is good because fire hurts if you touch it.

455
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,144
Speaker 1: you know if you like light a fire Not to.

456
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:07,912
Speaker 1: most animals are gonna run away from the fire.

457
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,640
Speaker 1: if you have a campfire near your camp.

458
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:14,019
Speaker 1: It's a good way to keep away bears and raccoons and things from eating you in your sleep.

459
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,147
Speaker 1: Humans aren't so afraid of fire.

460
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,117
Speaker 1: I mean some of them are but some humans are pyromaniacs.

461
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:20,780
Speaker 1: They love fire.

462
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,247
Speaker 1: They like they set themselves on fire even now.

463
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,695
Speaker 0: I do note that there's no pyromaniac chickens.

464
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:26,918
Speaker 1: No no there aren't.

465
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:30,720
Speaker 0: so Maybe there are yes, and they're just really unfulfilled now.

466
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:47,030
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's any evidences or studies or things for this or anthropologies or whatever, but I am pretty confident that the pyromaniac nature of some human beings was a Significant contributing factor to the advancement of human civilization.

467
00:31:47,110 --> 00:32:01,487
Speaker 1: the fact that you there is at least some humans who were not afraid of fire And we're curious about fire and thus investigated it and learned to take advantage of it is Why we are here today with computers and clothing and cars and everything else.

468
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:03,530
Speaker 1: fire is just that important I?

469
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,312
Speaker 0: Think there's actually a little bit more to it than that.

470
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:07,280
Speaker 0: you think there's more to it.

471
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:09,954
Speaker 0: I would actually go forward to say that it's not fire in general.

472
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:11,100
Speaker 0: It's just danger.

473
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,263
Speaker 0: I mean think of the.

474
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,513
Speaker 0: anytime there's a natural disaster something horrible crazy happens.

475
00:32:15,573 --> 00:32:16,556
Speaker 0: something weird happens.

476
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:19,746
Speaker 0: something dangerous happens While many people flee.

477
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:25,229
Speaker 0: I note that whenever something like that happens pretty much Universally animals avoid it.

478
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:32,258
Speaker 0: whenever there is something strange Animals avoid it, but humans tend to be drawn to it for better or for worse.

479
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:33,684
Speaker 0: yes In fact I would.

480
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:37,740
Speaker 0: I would point out that I would say it's more often for worse than for better.

481
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:43,709
Speaker 0: Yes, but for every thousand humans who died in a fire I think what it is is in the short term right.

482
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,220
Speaker 1: it is worse because people are going into crazy dangerous situations.

483
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:55,213
Speaker 1: Oh for the individual yes for the long term and for the entire species of human beings I think it has been better.

484
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:56,140
Speaker 1: it might not be better now.

485
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,839
Speaker 0: But for every thousand humans who died in a fire one of them cooked some meat or made some metal.

486
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:02,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, well made metal.

487
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:04,940
Speaker 1: You don't make metal you Smith it well.

488
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:13,185
Speaker 0: No, no some fire could have ended up causing some metal to melt out of a rock or something or invented eternal combustion Or something like that.

489
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,571
Speaker 0: Maybe external combustion.

490
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:19,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, or spontaneous human combustion Which is fake?

491
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:20,886
Speaker 0: Just got to get that out there.

492
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:22,394
Speaker 1: I thought it happened at least.

493
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:22,797
Speaker 1: no never.

494
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:24,524
Speaker 0: no It's never been documented.

495
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:28,700
Speaker 0: at every single time someone who's claimed spontaneous human combustion.

496
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,358
Speaker 0: The odds were that the person was a smoker living alone and died in their bed, huh?

497
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,980
Speaker 1: I thought I heard a story that like someone was sitting in a chair, and then they were dust on the chair.

498
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:39,944
Speaker 1: Nothing else was burned.

499
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:40,888
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that can happen.

500
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,620
Speaker 0: There's a clear physical process for that happening.

501
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:44,678
Speaker 1: Oh, so what is it?

502
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,328
Speaker 0: It has to do with the fact that there's fat in the body.

503
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:54,600
Speaker 0: you basically burn like a wick and a super hot fire will Form right there, but due to the nature of that kind of fire it won't burn anything else.

504
00:33:55,424 --> 00:34:02,160
Speaker 1: Oh, it's pretty interesting, so I guess let's see that's the phenomena I had heard about and that's why I assumed in spontaneous human combustion was real.

505
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:06,564
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, no I guess it's just that phenomena and that phenomenon can happen But it's not spontaneous.

506
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:14,873
Speaker 0: most of those people either dropped a match on themselves or were smoking in bed or had an oxygen tank Or there was an electrical fire, and they were too old to wake up.

507
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:19,050
Speaker 1: all right all right Yeah, but there can be spontaneous non-human combustion.

508
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:23,768
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like if you have a stack of old dry magazines That's really tall in a bad place.

509
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,757
Speaker 0: Yep, or latex gloves with baking soda on them Yeah, that could do it, too.

510
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:29,606
Speaker 1: So watch out for that.

511
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:32,956
Speaker 1: or do it on purpose in a safe place or you know what.

512
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:36,620
Speaker 0: if you're in an old house It's not a good idea to go to an old light switch.

513
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,958
Speaker 0: Just flick it on and off a bunch of times as fast as you can.

514
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,699
Speaker 0: That's not the best idea.

515
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:43,206
Speaker 1: No, I guess not.

516
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,389
Speaker 0: so uh or if your fuse is gone You know the fuse fell out or the fuse is busted.

517
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:55,100
Speaker 0: you don't have a new fuse even though I've only lived in one house that had fuses in my life, so I own one fuse that in my bag of electrical stuff.

518
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,488
Speaker 0: but I Fuses aren't used in houses anymore.

519
00:34:57,508 --> 00:35:10,682
Speaker 0: if you have a house that has a fuse and the fuse burns out And you don't have a replacement fuse Don't put a quarter in the fuse box or or a penny or a wire or a bullet a Bullet.

520
00:35:10,702 --> 00:35:14,159
Speaker 0: remember that apocryphal tale of the bullet replacing the fuse in the car.

521
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not good.

522
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,957
Speaker 0: Louis black tells the story like it's true.

523
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:21,972
Speaker 1: It's not Yeah, a lot of people tell stories like the true that they're not.

524
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,600
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we should do a show on that.

525
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

526
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:28,180
Speaker 1: Anyway, why don't we tell some humorous fire anecdotes?

527
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Speaker 0: Well get the show over with I often as a kid like to set things on fire, but I was not a pyromaniac.

528
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:38,000
Speaker 1: Well, I also like to set things on fire and I like to play with fire.

529
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:44,000
Speaker 1: But I knew it was dangerous and I was slightly more afraid of getting hurt than I was willing to play with the fire.

530
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,734
Speaker 1: And also my parents are pretty strict about not letting me play with fire.

531
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:51,909
Speaker 1: So it was a rare opportunity I got to do dangerous fiery things.

532
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,536
Speaker 0: See I was completely the opposite.

533
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:54,560
Speaker 0: I wasn't afraid at all.

534
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:55,946
Speaker 0: I had a fresno lens.

535
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,493
Speaker 0: I melted asphalt with it.

536
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,980
Speaker 0: I set leaves on fire.

537
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:02,039
Speaker 0: I've set fireworks on fire with the fresno lens.

538
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:10,740
Speaker 0: In fact, I am very lucky that I have all of my fingers because I was drawn to fireworks much like moth to the flame.

539
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,960
Speaker 1: Yeah fireworks are illegal in Connecticut and you know some people around bought them and used them but my parents did not.

540
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:27,612
Speaker 1: So I was stuck, you know looking out my window at night at the people across the street with their fireworks, dude I was the kid having Roman candle fights with his friends.

541
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, shoot bottle rockets at each other.

542
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,216
Speaker 0: We tie army men to bottle rockets that at all their bottle rockets tied to them.

543
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:40,685
Speaker 0: one time We took one of those popper, you know, the little snapper throwers and we emptied out Oh, I had the snappers all the time.

544
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:45,200
Speaker 0: We emptied out the contents of like four bags of them into one gigantic thing.

545
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:47,614
Speaker 1: It's hard to do that because they'll snap when you try to open them up.

546
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:50,470
Speaker 1: There's like a little rock in there And yeah, we were real careful.

547
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:51,556
Speaker 0: It took a long time.

548
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:52,300
Speaker 1: It's really hard.

549
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,590
Speaker 1: That's why they're filled with sawdust is to keep them from snapping.

550
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,640
Speaker 0: a bunch of them went off and a few of us got hurt.

551
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,231
Speaker 0: But we did it and let me tell you it worked.

552
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:00,396
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna say.

553
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,902
Speaker 1: it sure does work I can.

554
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:03,990
Speaker 1: we've combined many of them into one before.

555
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:14,650
Speaker 0: our favorite thing to do where there's this one kind of firework that nominally it would shoot up into the air with wings and fire really really high and Coast for a while with different colors and then explode.

556
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:28,967
Speaker 0: so we'd tie like three of them together and then we'd have a fuse that would eventually light all three and we'd set that off and The basically what would happen was it go up into the air and then about halfway up It would suddenly change direction

557
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:29,630
Speaker 1: and the

558
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,350
Speaker 0: odds were that would come straight for you Pretty much without fail.

559
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,939
Speaker 0: It would come straight for you.

560
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:45,620
Speaker 1: Yeah even nowadays You know where I'm allowed to play with fire and I could play with fire pretty much whenever I want and I don't really care About playing with fire and I have things to play with fire.

561
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,060
Speaker 1: I'm still kind of afraid of actually more afraid of getting hurt with fire than I ever was.

562
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:56,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll know that I'm not - I don't I can't blame you because fireworks are dangerous.

563
00:37:56,702 --> 00:37:59,812
Speaker 0: But you were you pull you had the method of hold the match.

564
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:02,360
Speaker 0: hold the match as soon as you think the fuse went.

565
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:04,020
Speaker 0: You were already across the street.

566
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:16,240
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean cuz you know all I think about is I Imagine myself like standing right in front of a bottle rocket that's lit and just standing there not moving I've done and then it firing into me and I hit my bottle rockets.

567
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I imagine what's gonna happen.

568
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:26,060
Speaker 1: and I imagine like that little tiny stick like going right through my body and then exploding and like Blowing my head off and I don't want that to happen.

569
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:29,219
Speaker 0: See ya the answer is maybe it's just cuz I've been hit by fireworks a lot.

570
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:32,560
Speaker 0: But when you shoot a firework like that like a bottle rocket.

571
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:37,534
Speaker 0: Unless it hits you in the eye the odds of serious injury are pretty low.

572
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,680
Speaker 1: I'm just kind of afraid of injury.

573
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not afraid of fire.

574
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:42,893
Speaker 1: Like if this just a fire is sitting there.

575
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,460
Speaker 1: I'm like, ooh, and I'll play with it.

576
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll always throw stuff into it.

577
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:51,659
Speaker 0: Yep, but like those little UFOs we were shooting off It's impossible for those to hurt you even if they just went straight for your face.

578
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:54,455
Speaker 0: Maybe there you're pretty much fine.

579
00:38:54,597 --> 00:39:02,239
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Granted much of my non-fear fireworks has to do with being incredibly lucky and not having been hit by them in a dangerous way.

580
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, what other ways that I have fun with fire besides.

581
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:10,605
Speaker 0: my primary fear and the reason we didn't shoot for so many fireworks Off wasn't police.

582
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wasn't afraid of getting burned.

583
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:14,200
Speaker 0: I was afraid of the police busting me.

584
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,596
Speaker 1: I wonder what the penalty is for fireworks in New York.

585
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:16,878
Speaker 0: I don't know.

586
00:39:16,918 --> 00:39:20,372
Speaker 0: as a kid I wasn't afraid of the police with fireworks because I'm a kid.

587
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,260
Speaker 0: I'm invincible as far as I can see.

588
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:22,822
Speaker 1: What is it?

589
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:24,108
Speaker 1: a fine a jail?

590
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:24,510
Speaker 1: I don't know.

591
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,640
Speaker 0: It's probably a fine and they take away all your fireworks.

592
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,059
Speaker 1: Oh, I wonder how much the fine is cuz I'd be willing to pay the fine if it wasn't so much.

593
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:36,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is then they take away all your fireworks and I'm sure that's why you got to set them all off and Then pay the fine.

594
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:38,859
Speaker 0: I'm sure the fine is greater if you get caught again.

595
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:41,599
Speaker 1: Well, no, you set them all off before they catch you.

596
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:46,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is they come pretty set them all up at once with one giant fuse.

597
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:49,774
Speaker 0: I Got a story about that, but I'll save it for another time.

598
00:39:49,794 --> 00:39:50,599
Speaker 0: That's special.

599
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,868
Speaker 0: So we have anything else.

600
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,780
Speaker 0: or is this gonna turn into that one episode of twit?

601
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,730
Speaker 1: No, I could talk about all like.

602
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:58,374
Speaker 1: I've done a lot.

603
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:03,114
Speaker 1: I remember at summer camp We not just fire but we also like threw sodium in the lake.

604
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:04,479
Speaker 1: That was a lot of fun.

605
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:09,960
Speaker 1: But we I remember the one thing we did at summer camp is the summer camp was this very science II summer camp full of.

606
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:17,540
Speaker 1: We had a chemistry lab and Basically, the chemistry lab meant turn on the Bunsen burner and throw stuff into it and see what happens.

607
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:24,967
Speaker 1: Yeah And I remember if you would threw all the different things in there to get all the different colors like if you threw iron Filings into it you would get these sparks.

608
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:31,450
Speaker 1: and if you threw like this other powder into it get it would turn green and That's how I learned how fireworks worked.

609
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:37,272
Speaker 1: if you like take green stuff and iron Filings and you put them near a fire with some gunpowder, whatever.

610
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:42,831
Speaker 1: you would make a firework that had sparks and green and It was really fun.

611
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,080
Speaker 0: I love stuff like that.

612
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,619
Speaker 0: I always wanted to make fireworks as a kid, but my fireman dad dissuaded me.

613
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, he explained how dangerous it is to make fireworks real dangerous.

614
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:56,459
Speaker 1: Another thing we did at summer camp is we we were going to.

615
00:40:56,479 --> 00:41:01,200
Speaker 1: you know You make a campfire every week and you know You hold some hot dogs on a stick over it and then you eat him.

616
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,920
Speaker 1: Right if you took the plastic bag that had the hot dog buns, you know, well that previously contained hot dog buns.

617
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:10,260
Speaker 0: You don't throw that in the fire you don't throw it in the fire.

618
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,072
Speaker 1: That's dangerous releases poison gas if you hold it above the fire.

619
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:22,493
Speaker 1: enough above the fire that it won't burn Like, you know poison gas but enough above the fire that it will be heated up and warmed so that it will melt.

620
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:28,017
Speaker 1: when the drips of plastic fall into the fire one at a time they go.

621
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:38,020
Speaker 0: Well, I think You win the fire Contest here because while I know about fireworks, I never thought of that.

622
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:39,188
Speaker 1: I didn't think of it either.

623
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:40,959
Speaker 1: the can't the counselor who knew how to do it.

624
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:50,560
Speaker 0: Yeah I didn't play much with fire itself other than actually One of my favorite pastimes as a kid and part of this came out of the fact that my dad was a fireman in Detroit.

625
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,545
Speaker 0: We lived there in the 80s.

626
00:41:52,946 --> 00:41:54,773
Speaker 0: If you don't know much about the city of Detroit.

627
00:41:54,833 --> 00:42:04,940
Speaker 0: I suggest you read about something called Devil's Knights But devil's night is sort of universal then no now Detroit devil's night is not like it is anywhere else.

628
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:09,797
Speaker 0: All right, it's better now, but back in the day the city fucking burned to the ground every year.

629
00:42:09,817 --> 00:42:11,164
Speaker 0: Uh-huh It was bad.

630
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:15,945
Speaker 0: We're talking fire bombs and houses Say Michigan cultural phenomenon.

631
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:16,266
Speaker 1: Yes.

632
00:42:16,788 --> 00:42:18,492
Speaker 0: I know my shit when it comes to Michigan.

633
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:19,895
Speaker 0: All right, don't you?

634
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:21,279
Speaker 0: don't you be treading?

635
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,545
Speaker 1: Decline of devil's night arson.

636
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:31,219
Speaker 0: Michigan's the only state as far as I know that is declared war both on a foreign nation and on another state.

637
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:33,810
Speaker 0: But I digress.

638
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:46,800
Speaker 0: my dad was a fireman So when he was off-duty he still had the radio and everything and we had the police scanner and the fire scanner with the real chip so we could actually Listen everything and whenever there was a fire nearby or we'd also we'd always go for walks like the Sunday walk.

639
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,908
Speaker 0: We just walk around the neighborhood.

640
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:48,673
Speaker 0: talked to all the people.

641
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:49,257
Speaker 0: it was good fun.

642
00:42:49,297 --> 00:42:59,531
Speaker 0: as a kid My dad could smell a fire from like 40 miles away And he could tell you if it was a car fire or a house fire or a factory fire or whatever And it was close enough.

643
00:42:59,813 --> 00:43:00,498
Speaker 0: He could find it.

644
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:03,200
Speaker 0: so more often than you'd expect.

645
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:10,224
Speaker 0: My family would show up at the scene of a fire and just kind of hang back and watch the house burn down and watch the Firefighters tried to.

646
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:11,350
Speaker 1: was your dad a fireman?

647
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,100
Speaker 1: wasn't he supposed to save the people or whatever?

648
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:14,688
Speaker 0: Not when he's not on duty.

649
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,059
Speaker 0: There were other firemen who were perfectly capable of doing that.

650
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:22,560
Speaker 1: Really so like if you're a fireman and you walk past a fire you don't do anything cuz other firemen take care.

651
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:23,872
Speaker 0: He didn't have any equipment on him.

652
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:25,523
Speaker 0: if there was an emergency I'm sure he would have.

653
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:31,912
Speaker 0: but remember in an old house fire when like there's an old house that's on fire It's already too late to save the house.

654
00:43:31,952 --> 00:43:34,879
Speaker 0: They're not trying to save the house They go in and save the people.

655
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:40,479
Speaker 0: Once the people are out their primary duty is to save the neighboring houses not to save your house.

656
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,560
Speaker 1: That sucks also.

657
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:51,511
Speaker 0: Detroit firefighters are one of the few fire departments left in America that if they're trying to save a building or put out a fire They practice internal firefighting meaning

658
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:52,154
Speaker 1: even

659
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:57,674
Speaker 0: if there's no one to save They will March into the building with hoses and put the fire out from the inside.

660
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,098
Speaker 1: Is that more effective?

661
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:01,415
Speaker 0: Yes It's also much more dangerous.

662
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:10,500
Speaker 0: I know that Most fire departments from what I've read Will fight the fire from the outside and do damage control more so than stopping the fire at its core.

663
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,306
Speaker 1: Can you spray into the window or something?

664
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:13,250
Speaker 0: Oh, you can you can.

665
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,080
Speaker 0: hey, I'm not gonna talk about that in detail.

666
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:20,040
Speaker 0: Maybe if you guys are interested I could do a special just when Scott's out of town about that.

667
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,376
Speaker 0: But firefighting is pretty cool and it's kind of related.

668
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:24,020
Speaker 0: It's all in the show.

669
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:24,904
Speaker 0: I got an anecdote.

670
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:27,315
Speaker 0: My dad wanted to be a policeman when he was young.

671
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:37,080
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and his father and his father's father were firemen and His dad when he learned that my dad wanted to be a fireman as policeman of a policeman?

672
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,550
Speaker 0: Yes, yes as two very appointed questions.

673
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:40,172
Speaker 0: He said first.

674
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:42,080
Speaker 0: Do you know any happy firemen?

675
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, you and Bob and all the people we know and yeah, they're all pretty happy.

676
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:47,685
Speaker 0: Do you know any happy cops?

677
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:52,238
Speaker 0: and I know that we lived in Detroit at the time and my dad became a fireman.

678
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:56,418
Speaker 0: Yep You got any fire anecdotes before we end this.

679
00:44:57,417 --> 00:45:00,752
Speaker 1: Um We saw that car fire as we draw.

680
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.

681
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:05,870
Speaker 1: We I forget where we were driving from or to.

682
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:06,713
Speaker 1: was it.

683
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,180
Speaker 1: I don't was it from Otacon to the shore?

684
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,944
Speaker 1: I don't even remember.

685
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:11,372
Speaker 0: I think we were driving to Albany.

686
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:12,799
Speaker 0: I don't remember at all.

687
00:45:13,181 --> 00:45:20,800
Speaker 1: But basically we driving and we saw like a huge plume of black smoke and we're like, whoa big fire.

688
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:27,467
Speaker 1: We go around this corner on the highway and there's a van and Basically, the van is super on fire.

689
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:31,960
Speaker 1: like fire is coming out all the windows of this minivan coming out of the front of the car.

690
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:33,520
Speaker 1: It's just super on fire.

691
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,599
Speaker 1: It looks like someone poured gas in the car and then threw a match in there and ran away.

692
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:41,194
Speaker 0: now Luckily, we saw obviously the entire family standing back from it.

693
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:41,937
Speaker 1: Did we see?

694
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:42,560
Speaker 1: I didn't see them.

695
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,348
Speaker 0: I saw people standing back from the car.

696
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't see people in the car or outside of the car.

697
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,827
Speaker 1: So I wasn't sure they were standing way back.

698
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:52,359
Speaker 0: All right, they definitely had the look on their faces of what the fuck.

699
00:45:52,974 --> 00:46:01,420
Speaker 1: Yes But just for the thing that really makes this story is the fact that Was it slightly before we saw the fire or slightly after we saw the fire?

700
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,687
Speaker 0: I think it was just after we saw the fire.

701
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:11,019
Speaker 1: a cop pulled over someone for like speeding on our side of the road while The giant fire was on the other side of the road and there was no EMS or police at that fire.

702
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:11,200
Speaker 0: yet.

703
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:20,713
Speaker 0: No it was just a car on fire on the side of the road and we know they knew because I called 911 and I said car fire and they can tell where I am from the GPS whatever.

704
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:27,372
Speaker 0: and they said on the throughway I'm like, yeah, he's like my marker X and I'm like, yeah, he's like.

705
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,013
Speaker 0: we know about it.

706
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:29,437
Speaker 0: Thanks click.

707
00:46:29,918 --> 00:46:30,139
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

708
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, good times.

709
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:34,699
Speaker 1: Fire eyes are awesome.

710
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:39,080
Speaker 0: I imagine we'll do more fire episodes in the future when we have nothing better to talk about.

711
00:46:39,803 --> 00:46:43,739
