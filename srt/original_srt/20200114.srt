1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,789
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, January 14th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:11,110
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:11,432
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,944
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:18,640
Speaker 0: Tonight, the new hotness in trick-taking games, Nokosu Dice.

6
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,238
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:29,760
Speaker 0: We're almost at the end of the convention, the densest convention season we've had in modern Geek Nights history.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, when's East like the right beginning of March or something?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,119
Speaker 0: East is like the end of February, beginning of March, so we got like.

10
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:42,019
Speaker 0: We got a little bit of time after South, but Pac South is this weekend, and I think we're ready for it.

11
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,526
Speaker 0: I'm a little tired doing all these cons in a row.

12
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:50,120
Speaker 0: As much as I love cons, I needed like one more weekend in my life.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,340
Speaker 0: Especially because like I'm tearing apart, like I'm buying all new furniture, and I'm like redoing bedrooms and all this nonsense.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,782
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:01,860
Speaker 0: So, uh, our hiatus, as you know, is mostly over, but there might be a little bit of hiatus.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,347
Speaker 0: You got any open-y bits?

17
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:04,920
Speaker 0: Anything happen to you in the last couple days?

18
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:07,160
Speaker 1: My shoulder has been hurting.

19
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,731
Speaker 1: My neck shoulder has been hurting for like a few months.

20
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:11,996
Speaker 1: I don't even remember when it started.

21
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:13,160
Speaker 0: Oh, a few months?

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,559
Speaker 0: I thought this was only like a few weeks.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,101
Speaker 0: No.

24
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:19,322
Speaker 0: If I have a pain that lasts more than a week and I don't know what caused it, I go to a doctor like right away.

25
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:23,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was no thing that, it's not like something fell on me or I fell down.

26
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:25,161
Speaker 1: It just has been hurting.

27
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:31,440
Speaker 0: I mean, I know you and not to speculate on your health, but if I had to guess anything, it's your hunch.

28
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:32,362
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,131
Speaker 0: I feel like your hunch might be the problem.

30
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:35,760
Speaker 1: The hunch that hasn't been a problem ever.

31
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,171
Speaker 0: I feel like it will eventually be a problem.

32
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:48,439
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it's been hurting in a weird, it got, at one point it got really worse and then it got better, you know, better, but not all the way better and then worse again.

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,001
Speaker 1: Yeah.

34
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:57,290
Speaker 1: So everyone's like, go to the doctor, and I'm like, man, the doctor's just gonna be like, you're getting old, stuff hurts, whatever, just go to physical therapy or something.

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,194
Speaker 1: I don't care, right?

36
00:01:58,475 --> 00:01:59,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, physical therapy is awesome.

37
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,291
Speaker 1: I don't want to waste time with that.

38
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,857
Speaker 1: It works, it works really well.

39
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:04,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

40
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,907
Speaker 1: I only want to go to a doctor.

41
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:13,340
Speaker 1: if they can tell me this is exactly the thing that is wrong, I have identified it.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,469
Speaker 0: Here's the problem, you realize like almost no medicine works that way.

43
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,272
Speaker 1: Correct, which is why I'll just like, whatever, if you can't tell me what's wrong, then you can't possibly believe that you can fix it.

44
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:27,495
Speaker 0: No, but they can tell you what's likely wrong, they can give you likely options that will make it better.

45
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:36,267
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I finally go to the doctor because, you know, because I have a self-treated wound I can talk about, I'll show off my swollen finger in a minute.

46
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:41,806
Speaker 1: So he's just like, you know, it's like, he's like, oh, yeah, you got some kind of spasm.

47
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,780
Speaker 1: I'm like, okay, I'm like, shouldn't that mean the muscles moving on its own?

48
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,511
Speaker 1: He's like, no, that doesn't have to mean that.

49
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:49,747
Speaker 0: Usually in that kind of case, it means it like tenses up and doesn't let go.

50
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

51
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,660
Speaker 0: Or it tenses up and like pushes a nerve.

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, something along those lines.

53
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:57,300
Speaker 0: I've had a lot of, I've had injuries that cause those kinds of things over the years.

54
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,812
Speaker 1: He's like, oh, I'll prescribe you these drugs or whatever.

55
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:05,190
Speaker 1: And I'm like, if it's just a pain killing drug, I'm like, I'm not in that serious pain that I need a pain killing drug.

56
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,940
Speaker 0: See, that's something I've never understood about you because if I'm in pain, I will just always take a painkiller right away because why have pain ever?

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,672
Speaker 0: But the point is- Why ever experience pain if you don't have to?

58
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:18,633
Speaker 1: The pain that I'm in is so minor, right, that it's not worth the trade-off of whatever.

59
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:22,608
Speaker 1: Like Tylenol messes up your liver, aspirin and the other ones mess up your stomach.

60
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:25,060
Speaker 0: Usually not, only if your stomach has other problems usually.

61
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,688
Speaker 1: I mean, my stomach's not the best stomach.

62
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:27,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

63
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:28,477
Speaker 0: That is true.

64
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,180
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I'll take like unbuffered aspirin, like fuck it and I'm fine, but not everyone has that luxury.

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,920
Speaker 1: The point is, you know, if pain is, I guess, I don't know if my pain tolerance is high, but like- Or you've just never experienced true pain.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,740
Speaker 1: Well, I've experienced pain, but the point is, I feel like, you know, most of the pains I have, you know, have had are not so severe that there's any point in, you know, even this pain.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:59,200
Speaker 1: It's been nagging and long, but it has only once been like, once did it get bad enough that I considered like a Tylenol.

68
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,100
Speaker 0: You have to worry, though, because if it's been around for a while, usually there's some underlying cause that isn't just like old men.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, I want you to identify this cause.

70
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,552
Speaker 1: So, doctor said it's a spasm, right?

71
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:10,700
Speaker 1: I have no reason to disbelieve, right?

72
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,165
Speaker 1: You know, that's what the doctor said.

73
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,780
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's like, alright, take these drugs or whatever.

74
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,760
Speaker 1: So, I took them, and buggin' nothin' happened.

75
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:28,340
Speaker 1: Aren't like, you know, if you take, like, if you take a pain killing drug over the counter, do you feel effects in the short term?

76
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if I take an aspirin within an hour, whatever, like, pain I have is usually gone.

77
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he gave me basically what is the prescription equivalent of Aleve, I guess, stronger, or just more of it per pill.

78
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:39,195
Speaker 1: Alright.

79
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,720
Speaker 1: And it had no effect whatsoever.

80
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:46,878
Speaker 0: Well, maybe your spasm's bad, or you just probably gotta go back- It feels the same as it has.

81
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you should go in for a follow-up.

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,580
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, I only went there, like, yesterday.

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll give it a few weeks, but I- But, I mean, I'll, you know, I'll keep takin' it, but if nothin' happens- I'm just sayin', if I had to guess, it's the hunch.

84
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,780
Speaker 1: Well, the point is, either, you know, I'm not talkin' about this particular problem anymore, right?

85
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:18,980
Speaker 1: But, rather, you know, my skepticism of painkillers in general is that either I'm some kind of freak and they don't work on me at all, or they don't work, period, and there's placebos for everybody, I'm inclined to believe both of those things.

86
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:31,320
Speaker 0: Nah, but possibly what happens with some, depending on the situation, is a drug isn't actually tailored to that kind of pain, and you can take a different drug, or, for whatever reason, you have resistance, gotta take more of a drug.

87
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,260
Speaker 0: Like, for whatever reason, when I got my wisdom teeth out, it took more anesthesia than normal to put me down.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,331
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, that is a painkiller that I use.

89
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:43,039
Speaker 1: It's usually a local anesthetic, right?

90
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,320
Speaker 1: The dentist.

91
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:44,980
Speaker 1: That's the kind of painkiller that I use.

92
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,860
Speaker 0: If I work out and I even just have, like, a headache, I'll just take an aspirin.

93
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:55,660
Speaker 1: But I was thinking, like, there have been, you know, I'd rarely get headaches, but, like, there was a time where I had a headache that was, you know, annoying enough to do something about it.

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,000
Speaker 1: I took a Tylenol or whatever, it didn't do fuckin' anything, I still had the headache, I feel like the Tylenol didn't do shit, and painkillers are a bunch of bullshit.

95
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know, when I take a Tylenol...

96
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:09,119
Speaker 1: Is it because I take them rarely that they don't, you know...

97
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,980
Speaker 0: No, there's not really a thing like that.

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:23,100
Speaker 1: I take them, like, you know, I can't even remember the literally, it must have been at least ten, maybe not even, when was the last time I took any painkilling drug, even over the counter, that wasn't a local anesthetic for at an office?

99
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,723
Speaker 1: I took some this morning, 'cause I did

100
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:49,780
Speaker 0: not break my finger, but I bruised it severely, and I've been self-treating, because with sports injuries, which it's like, sports injuries are like this one subset of injuries, where you almost all the time, if you can correctly identify, like, the problem yourself, unless it, like, gets out of certain bounds, like, very clear guardrails of when that's okay, there's literally nothing a doctor can do for you that you can't do on your own, as long as you know what to do.

101
00:06:50,180 --> 00:07:02,440
Speaker 1: Well, the point is, I rarely take them, now, you know, this is the first time I've taken one in several, several years, and the fact that it did nothing leaves me being skeptical about its efficacy, at least on me.

102
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,560
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sorry, I think you need a higher dose, or go back to your doctor and say it didn't work.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:16,200
Speaker 1: If I take all these drugs, and it doesn't work, I'm definitely gonna go back, and be like, hey, my arm still hurts, I took all these drugs, and at least the drugs were very inexpensive.

104
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,229
Speaker 0: I will bet you money.

105
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,259
Speaker 0: it's the hunch, in the end.

106
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, well, what are you gonna do?

107
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:28,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause I don't think it's an acute biking injury, because you can get a thing with, like, hunch shoulders from biking too much, but it's not biking season, you haven't biked much.

108
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:42,698
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, in some news, there's actually some pretty big gaming news, that, uh, it's one of those things where, in retrospect, a lot of people probably saw it coming, but no one specifically predicted it, but,

109
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,880
Speaker 1: basically- Well, I saw it coming, but then it took so long that I sort of forgot.

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:56,200
Speaker 0: But I didn't see, I didn't see Final Fantasy Flight Interactive just shutting down, I saw Fantasy Flight having a problem.

111
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:57,098
Speaker 0: I saw that, too.

112
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,920
Speaker 0: I don't feel like Fantasy Flight is a super healthy company, not that I don't know anything about their inner workings.

113
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,738
Speaker 1: I know about it.

114
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,700
Speaker 0: I mean, like, I don't know their corporate details, like, I don't know- I do.

115
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,546
Speaker 0: What do you know?

116
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,439
Speaker 1: So, Fantasy Flight was started by the guy who made fucking Twilight Imperial and everything.

117
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,240
Speaker 0: No, I'm talking, like, what's their revenue, what's their expenses- Oh, it's a private company, you don't know that.

118
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:18,980
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, those are the things we can't know.

119
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:29,000
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was started by that guy, and by all accounts, based on reports from former employees, sites like Glassdoor, et cetera, it was a really toxic and shitty place to work.

120
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:48,740
Speaker 1: Uh, not in necessarily- I'm not saying not at all, right, but the reports I saw weren't about things, like, that you would expect in the modern times, like, sexism and harassment type things, but more like micromanaging and being stupid, making stupid decisions and those sorts of things.

121
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,100
Speaker 0: My only point is that we don't know the details.

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,520
Speaker 0: All we have are anecdotes from people who no longer work there, who have talked about it publicly or semi-publicly.

123
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,879
Speaker 0: Oh, people who did work there reported also, right?

124
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:06,660
Speaker 1: But you could see all of those reports about it just being a bad, you know, sort of culture, you could see those reflected in their games.

125
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,838
Speaker 1: For example, one notable incident in the Netrunner days, right, was there was a card that was clearly OP.

126
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,260
Speaker 1: Big time OP card, right?

127
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:20,280
Speaker 1: And the thing is, we know there are playtesters of this game, right?

128
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,540
Speaker 1: And even though they were supposed to not say they were playtesters and keep secrets, right, they wouldn't.

129
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:27,400
Speaker 1: We got lowdowns, right?

130
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,032
Speaker 1: And then you would see people's names in the credits and it's like, "Oh, yeah, I know that guy.

131
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:31,875
Speaker 1: He told me that.

132
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:32,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay,

133
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:32,798
Speaker 1: right.".

134
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:44,139
Speaker 1: But, uh, so people who will not be named, right, uh, would say things to the, you know, it would leak out in the community, "Oh, yeah, we playtested that card and all of us said that card was hella

135
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,360
Speaker 1: OP.".

136
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:51,960
Speaker 1: And it got changed during playtesting, but then when the card came out, printed in the final pack, it was back to its original thing.

137
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:08,398
Speaker 1: And the story that was told, right, unverified story that was told, was that, you know, I guess the game designers made decision X and then they, you know, the management was like, "You know, for some reason, wanted, you know, the card to be sexier and more

138
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:08,820
Speaker 1: powerful.".

139
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,600
Speaker 1: It's kind of micromanaging nonsense, right?

140
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:15,060
Speaker 1: And, you know, that's just a small thing if that even happened.

141
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:32,340
Speaker 1: But, you know, that matches the kind of thing, right, that you, and when you look at their games as a whole, right, as a company, they mostly produced, the games that they produced themselves, right, in-house, tend to not be this very few in-house games that are any good.

142
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like, to be perfectly clear, like, in terms of our taste in games, uh, if a game happens to be, like, published by Fantasy Flight, eh, fine, whatever.

143
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:41,980
Speaker 0: They do a good job with that.

144
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,920
Speaker 1: They focus mostly on theme and art, which they do actually a good job of, right, but the game mechanics are bad.

145
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,360
Speaker 1: The good games that they've published are games where someone else has made them and they've published it.

146
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,700
Speaker 1: Like, they're the publisher of Atticus and Euphrates, right?

147
00:10:55,341 --> 00:11:03,080
Speaker 1: Or, games where, like Netrunner, where, yeah, the original game was made by someone else and then they brought it in and mixed it up a little bit.

148
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,859
Speaker 0: And slowly killed it.

149
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,920
Speaker 1: Right, like Netforge, Netrunner, Keyforge, yes, and slowly killed it, right?

150
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,160
Speaker 0: Keyforge was the fastest I went from "I am interested" to, like, halfway through my first and only play of Keyforge, I got bored.

151
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,479
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, oh.

152
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, they did start back in the, remember, XCOM the board game?

153
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,717
Speaker 1: So, they started, you know, an interactive- We own that, don't we?

154
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:26,498
Speaker 1: I got rid of it.

155
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:26,860
Speaker 0: Okay.

156
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:30,700
Speaker 1: They started an interactive division, uh, to make software.

157
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:38,899
Speaker 1: Not that long ago, like, in- Around the time XCOM came out, and I thought that company was mostly gonna be making apps to accompany games, like, like Xcom.

158
00:11:39,343 --> 00:11:39,434
Speaker 0: Yup.

159
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:49,720
Speaker 0: A link to Rock Paper Shotgun, they have a decent article about it, but basically in 2017, they founded Fantasy Flight Interactive, specifically to make digital versions of their own core and card games.

160
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,160
Speaker 1: Right, I think it was also to make things like the XCOM app.

161
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,979
Speaker 1: But anyway, the thing that they've been making and working the most on was a digital version of the Lord of the Rings, uh, LCG.

162
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,220
Speaker 0: Seems to be the only game they've released.

163
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,160
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't think it even finished, like, I don't know if it's still beta or incomplete or whatever.

164
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:11,200
Speaker 1: I never- And I also heard from people that it was a significant departure from the original card game.

165
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,587
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,099
Speaker 1: Like, it wasn't exactly the same thing.

167
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:16,319
Speaker 0: But anyway- I didn't run into people who had positive opinions of it.

168
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, nobody really played it that much at all.

169
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:28,220
Speaker 1: It didn't, you know, even some of the minor, you know, like, you know, digital card games, it's like the top tier of digital card games has got to be like Magic Arena and Hearthstone.

170
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:31,960
Speaker 1: You go to the next level down and you got your Gwent's and those sorts of things.

171
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,480
Speaker 1: And I guess Duo List used to be a thing like that, maybe in the third tier.

172
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:35,972
Speaker 1: Yup.

173
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,580
Speaker 1: This thing, I don't even know what tier it got to, but it wasn't even third.

174
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,098
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause like- Definitely below third.

175
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,860
Speaker 0: Lord of the Rings fandom is not at, say, a high watermark right now out in the world.

176
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,680
Speaker 0: Right, well then- And Hearthstone and other games exist, so unless this game brings something else to the table, it's a little too, little too late.

177
00:12:51,900 --> 00:13:00,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, Fantasy Flight mostly made most of their money on licensed things, and they lost the Games Workshop license a while back.

178
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:00,677
Speaker 0: Yup.

179
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,480
Speaker 1: They lost the Netrunner license, which is what killed Netrunner, otherwise it would probably still be going.

180
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,420
Speaker 1: And mostly they've been leaning on the Star Wars license, but some of their Star Wars stuff is hit or miss, right?

181
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:11,820
Speaker 1: Yup.

182
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,840
Speaker 1: So the Star Wars Destiny, like the dice game, they killed that today, which is after the layoff news, right?

183
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,599
Speaker 1: The original Star Wars LCG, I think, died a while ago.

184
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,080
Speaker 1: But I think X-Wing is really their big money maker, 'cause that thing keeps going, and you see those things everywhere.

185
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,699
Speaker 1: Even in Barnes and Noble, they got X-Wing.

186
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,140
Speaker 1: So a lot of people are playing X-Wing somewhere still.

187
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,719
Speaker 1: But anyway, so a while back, they got acquired by Asmodei, a much bigger game company, and we were like, "Oh, that's the end of

188
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:39,920
Speaker 1: them.".

189
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,120
Speaker 1: That's when I thought it was the end of them, right?

190
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:52,000
Speaker 1: They were just gonna be absorbed, and you know, I thought it was more of like a- Well, it was a- A higher- I think it was the things like get their licenses, you know, and that sort of thing, right?

191
00:13:52,861 --> 00:14:05,220
Speaker 1: And then, you know, that head guy, the guy who actually I think was, you know, the Twilight Imperium guy or whatever, who I don't think was a positive impact, judging by the corporate culture stories, but I think he left, right?

192
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,213
Speaker 1: So it's like, "Okay, that seems like a positive

193
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:07,536
Speaker 1: move.".

194
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:25,380
Speaker 1: But yeah, since like those times, like those, you know, since the Netrunner times, like Netrunner ended, they got acquired, it's sort of been downhill, like you haven't seen, you know, good, big, positive news about them come out, like they haven't announced- you know, other than Keyforge- Well,

195
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:30,800
Speaker 0: what's also notable is you don't see a lot of negative- like you don't see people like complaining about a change in Keyforge or something.

196
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,120
Speaker 1: Well, no, no, what I'm saying is that- well, you're not paying too much attention to the Keyforge community, I'm not either.

197
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:34,353
Speaker 0: Yeah.

198
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,580
Speaker 1: So you don't know what they're saying in there.

199
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,000
Speaker 0: But usually you see that at least like fly by in social media.

200
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,356
Speaker 1: Right, but other than Keyforge, they haven't announced a new game, they haven't had another big success, like what else are they even doing, right?

201
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,817
Speaker 1: And now it's like, "Okay, we're laying people off, we got rid of the interactive thing that wasn't going anywhere, you know, we're ending the Star Wars dice

202
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:55,019
Speaker 1: game.".

203
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,926
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Oh yeah, that's totally expected.

204
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,720
Speaker 1: I saw that coming back when you got acquired/merged.

205
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:02,329
Speaker 1: Why is it taking this long?

206
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,135
Speaker 1: I thought they would work

207
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:03,559
Speaker 1: faster.".

208
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:12,753
Speaker 0: Okay, so in 2019, just by looking at Wikipedia, so I may be wrong, the only things they released were 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 expansions to the X-Wing game.

209
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

210
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,040
Speaker 0: Or to Star Wars Legion.

211
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,340
Speaker 1: I told you that- oh, Legion's different.

212
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's to Star Wars Legion, they released like a Landspeeder and an AT-ST and a Tauntaun Rider.

213
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:30,920
Speaker 1: But anyway, miniatures have the biggest margins, they make a lot of money on them.

215
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:38,918
Speaker 1: But they also- people don't- I don't know how many people know, Fantasy Fight also makes RPGs, they have like this system, is it called Genesis or something?

216
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:39,280
Speaker 1: I don't know.

217
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,900
Speaker 1: It's some kind of system that might as well be D&D as far as I know.

218
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,880
Speaker 1: I don't think it has a lot of, you know, I mean it's obviously not the same rules-wise, but I don't think it's meaningfully different.

219
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,420
Speaker 1: It's clearly not like an indie RPG where it's a storytelling thing, right?

220
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,080
Speaker 1: But they produce sort of like GURPS, right?

221
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:05,400
Speaker 1: They use that system for several games, you can get a Star Wars or a Cthulhu, you know, several different role-playing settings.

222
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,180
Speaker 0: I'll admit I've never even like looked at the mechanics or rules for these things.

223
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, nobody plays this thing, which is why they also pretty much shut that down.

224
00:16:13,353 --> 00:16:15,700
Speaker 1: because, yeah, no one buys it or plays it.

225
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,182
Speaker 1: So what's really

226
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:28,661
Speaker 0: interesting, just like looking at these articles, is that one, it's very clear, like the stated mission of Fantasy Flight Interactive was not to make the Lord of the Rings game, it was to make digital versions of their physical games, which if they- The Lord

227
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:31,120
Speaker 1: of the Rings game is a digital version of one of their physical games.

228
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,060
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but the game's plural.

229
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:33,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did one.

230
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:46,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, they did one, didn't seem to succeed with it, didn't do any more, but it also seems like this was shut down as part of just more general broad layoffs across the whole merch company.

231
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:55,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like basically they're just like, "Okay, let's shut down all the stuff that isn't making any money, that's unpopular, and we'll just focus on the stuff that actually does make money.

232
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,653
Speaker 1: Everyone else get out of

233
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:56,835
Speaker 1: here.".

234
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:06,217
Speaker 1: Keep the keyforged rolling, keep the X-wing rolling, all these games we have that no one fucking plays, like these RPGs, get that shit out of here.

235
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,339
Speaker 1: Which means, okay, all you people who are working on those things, goodbye.

236
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:19,856
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so I never actually looked at this Lord of the Rings digital thing, but yeah, all these comments here are like, "It's mystifying that it chose to abandon both the original design and the business model of the tabletop Lord of the

237
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:20,199
Speaker 0: Rings.".

238
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,512
Speaker 1: Yep.

239
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,020
Speaker 0: So arguably it wasn't actually an implementation of a physical game, they just made this different game that was similar.

240
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,299
Speaker 1: So... That's what I heard.

241
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if I feel like this is just going to slowly fade away.

242
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:36,679
Speaker 1: I don't know.

243
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,820
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know what's going to happen.

244
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,620
Speaker 0: Will Asmodee just slowly eat it, and it'll just disappear entirely?

245
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,631
Speaker 0: Like, what's going to happen?

246
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:43,158
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

247
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:58,240
Speaker 1: It's one of those, you know, it's like, it's usually, I think the one success of fantasy, well, I mean, the one thing that makes fantasy play different from other board game companies, right, is that, well, at least what I see in the community is, what's another board game company?

248
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:58,834
Speaker 1: I don't know.

249
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:05,800
Speaker 0: I mean, it's funny because I think mostly in terms of the names of designers, I actually don't care who publishes a game.

250
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:06,619
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

251
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:09,520
Speaker 1: And that's the point, is that other, you know...

252
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,800
Speaker 0: Like, I think Andrés Zafar, I don't care who has the Puerto Rico license right now.

253
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,460
Speaker 1: Right, other game publishers usually don't have a fan, someone's not a fan of a publisher.

254
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:26,060
Speaker 1: They're usually a fan of a game or a designer, and they follow all the games a person makes, or they follow all the games in a series regardless of who makes and publishes them.

255
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,279
Speaker 0: Or the people who follow games that are based on an IP, based on the IP alone.

256
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,080
Speaker 0: They still don't care who made the game or even what the game is.

257
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:40,960
Speaker 1: But I actually know a lot of people who are, like, Fantasy Flight fans who are like, if Fantasy Flight makes a game, they're checking it out.

258
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,627
Speaker 1: Like, they're following the company.

259
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,620
Speaker 1: They go to the Fantasy Flight World, you know, game championships.

260
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,400
Speaker 0: I feel like I know of people like that, but I don't know people like that.

261
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,900
Speaker 1: Well, I know people like that because I was playing Netrunner.

262
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:56,680
Speaker 1: But it's like, there were people, like, they played Netrunner, and they were like, oh, Star Wars LCG, oh, Game of Thrones LCG, oh.

263
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,680
Speaker 1: And like, any time Fantasy Flight had a thing, like, they were into it, and they were, you know, not playing other companies' games as much.

264
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:05,740
Speaker 1: It was kind of like a thing.

265
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, people like us, we literally are like, what game is Cole Warrell going to release?

266
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,139
Speaker 0: Like, where is he?

267
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:16,260
Speaker 1: I was not interested in any Fantasy Flight game that wasn't Netrunner.

268
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,500
Speaker 1: That was developed by them.

269
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,360
Speaker 1: They published some games, like we said, Diggers and Euphrates.

270
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:32,660
Speaker 1: But games developed by them, there are almost none games developed in-house by them exclusively that I say are good.

271
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,939
Speaker 0: I guess the two takeaways are, big swaths of the tabletop industry globally are probably not doing that well right now.

272
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,879
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there's mad supply.

273
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've talked about this a bunch of times on the show.

274
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:55,399
Speaker 0: And two, I feel like if you care about tabletop games, you should focus on who is designing games as opposed to who is publishing games.

275
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,040
Speaker 1: But I think there are even people who are good designers.

276
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,696
Speaker 0: But then they work for, like, the design stable in a publisher.

277
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,855
Speaker 1: Right, when they worked at Fantasy Flight, they were stifled by that bad culture.

278
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,460
Speaker 1: So now who knows, maybe the layoffs can fix that culture problem.

279
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:11,781
Speaker 1: Well,

280
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:35,800
Speaker 0: one thing I've noticed, this is based on games I'm playing recently, but I feel like a lot of the designers, the games that are doing well lately, at least in our set, are the games that are designed primarily by designers who then either seek a publisher or partner with a publisher, as opposed to games that come out of a publisher or a studio that has a stable of designers that then release a game.

281
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,115
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, we also like games primarily for the mechanics of the game.

282
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,380
Speaker 1: We don't care if it's a fantasy or a Warhammer or a cyberpunk, even though cyberpunk is the best.

283
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:52,940
Speaker 1: We don't care about that too much, whereas Fantasy Flight as a company puts the theme first.

284
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:57,900
Speaker 1: And then mechanics are just like, yeah, slap whatever mechanics on this game, mostly.

285
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:05,312
Speaker 1: I mean, they care a little bit, but they notoriously had lots of problems writing rules and didn't fix those problems.

286
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:06,420
Speaker 1: They kept fucking up.

287
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,160
Speaker 1: It's like they didn't manage their competitive scene well, and they keep fucking it up.

288
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:24,700
Speaker 1: So it's like the things that you clearly, as a player of their games, you can see where their priorities lie, what you can see what they put effort into, and what they keep messing up and don't correct course on.

289
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,720
Speaker 1: Obviously, the only excuse is they don't care about that that much.

290
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,879
Speaker 1: That's why they keep messing it up, because they don't care to fix it.

291
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:33,380
Speaker 0: The other thing that I think might happen, but this is pure speculation.

292
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,779
Speaker 0: I don't have any knowledge of this.

293
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:48,800
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised if companies like Hasbro start to work more toward making those licensed IP games that are one step above the monopoly dross that tends to get thrown out, but probably not even as good as Fantasy Flight.

294
00:21:49,280 --> 00:22:08,240
Speaker 0: I feel like games that are a step or two better than the crap that usually gets IP associated with it will be just above the line to capture the majority of the "I want a game about Star Wars" market, or "I want a game about Doctor Who" or whatever property someone happens to care about.

295
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,800
Speaker 0: I feel like that is going to happen.

296
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:21,640
Speaker 0: You're going to see larger companies with stables of designers turning out IP-based games, and then you're going to see independent designers or designer studio or designer publisher coalitions.

297
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:29,319
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Cryptozoic was all about making the IP-based games, but Fantasy Flight just has a completely different style from them.

298
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,660
Speaker 1: Actually, Cryptozoic games are probably actually worse than Fantasy Flight games.

299
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,660
Speaker 1: Cryptozoic is like take whatever generic game and slap a thing on it.

300
00:22:39,102 --> 00:22:41,280
Speaker 1: Fantasy Flight, I think, is a little different.

301
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,617
Speaker 1: Usually, Fantasy Flight games more often try to make a competitive winning game and not just...

302
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:57,679
Speaker 0: Well, then you've got the third type of random kickstarted tabletop game that is just atrocious rules, and it's literally only a story and a theme.

303
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:03,300
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, there's a lot more to talk about here, but that's not what the show is about.

304
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,096
Speaker 0: So, in some other news, awesome games done quick happened.

305
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:07,840
Speaker 0: It was a good time.

306
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,484
Speaker 1: It's over.

307
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:10,720
Speaker 1: You'll have to wait until July for another one.

308
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,560
Speaker 0: Yep, I watched a few live, and I'm catching up on the YouTubes of the ones I missed.

309
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,619
Speaker 1: They've been slow to upload to YouTube, so I haven't been able to watch the ones I missed that I want to watch.

310
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,451
Speaker 0: I didn't watch the crowd control Zelda.

311
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,343
Speaker 1: I did watch that.

312
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:25,632
Speaker 1: That was quite excellent and surprising.

313
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:27,760
Speaker 1: I thought it would be a shit show, and it wasn't.

314
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,736
Speaker 0: But Super Metroid Impossible was A+.

315
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,111
Speaker 1: I didn't even know what it was.

316
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,379
Speaker 1: I was like, "What the hell is Super Metroid

317
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:34,600
Speaker 1: Impossible?".

318
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,618
Speaker 1: Neither did I. And I was very surprised by what it was.

319
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:46,639
Speaker 0: Yep, I think the moment when I realized I went from, "All right, this seems cool," to "Whoa," was when they go down to get the morph ball, and there's those spikes sitting there.

320
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:48,333
Speaker 0: And then the crowd was like, "Wait,

321
00:23:48,474 --> 00:23:48,857
Speaker 0: whoa.".

322
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,817
Speaker 0: And it only gets crazier from there.

323
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:59,140
Speaker 0: The other one I enjoyed particularly was The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, because that game is actually just crazy good.

324
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,600
Speaker 1: I've seen speedruns of that before.

325
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:08,180
Speaker 1: The one I really want to watch that I wasn't able to watch was apparently some crazy shmup that only two people have ever beaten.

326
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:15,158
Speaker 1: So it's like, "Well, if you beat it and no one else can beat it, then that's a speedrun because no one else is faster than

327
00:24:15,198 --> 00:24:15,298
Speaker 1: you.".

328
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,753
Speaker 0: It'd be like, "I'm number three in the

329
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:19,258
Speaker 0: world.".

330
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,580
Speaker 1: Right, you don't have to worry about any speedrunning strats.

331
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:26,560
Speaker 1: If you're the only one who can even beat the damn game, then congratulations, you're the fastest.

332
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,480
Speaker 1: Speedrunning only comes into play once everyone can beat the game, and then we have to do more to go faster.

333
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:43,632
Speaker 0: And in some last final news, Slay the Spire, as you know, we've talked about it before, is a fantastic single-player roguelike deck builder.

334
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,000
Speaker 0: that's on computers and the Switch.

335
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,418
Speaker 1: Hopefully it'll be on iOS soon.

336
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,420
Speaker 0: And I think the Switch is a better form factor.

337
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:49,923
Speaker 1: Nah.

338
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,828
Speaker 0: Because the controls are real good.

339
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,840
Speaker 0: You can play that game real fast.

340
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,000
Speaker 1: I can play it faster with my giant iPad, dragging cards onto the enemies.

341
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,360
Speaker 0: I guarantee touchscreen will be slower than the very intuitive and excellent UX of the two sticks.

342
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to use any sticks.

343
00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:06,132
Speaker 1: I play on the computer using the mouse.

344
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:07,559
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't I want to play using a...

345
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:08,999
Speaker 0: Have you played it on the Switch?

346
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:09,762
Speaker 1: No.

347
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,273
Speaker 1: Why would I buy it on the Switch?

348
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:12,160
Speaker 1: I already own it on Steam.

349
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,343
Speaker 0: Because I play it on the go.

350
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:18,100
Speaker 0: I love the game, but if I'm at home, I'm not going to sit here and play Slay the Spire.

351
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,580
Speaker 0: But if I'm on a train, I'll just play Slay the Spire all day.

352
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:21,680
Speaker 1: Anyway.

353
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,848
Speaker 0: So, the game is fantastic.

354
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:25,576
Speaker 0: It's had numerous expansions.

355
00:25:25,616 --> 00:25:26,520
Speaker 0: It keeps getting bug fixes.

356
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:31,014
Speaker 0: There is a lot of content if you just want to keep playing the game.

357
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,580
Speaker 0: It keeps giving you more challenges and stuff.

358
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,334
Speaker 0: But, they've added a fourth character.

359
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:37,460
Speaker 0: This has been known for a while.

360
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,470
Speaker 0: The fourth character was coming.

361
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,420
Speaker 0: You can go read the cards.

362
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,560
Speaker 0: It's finally out of its early testing and now it's in a beta where you guys can play the beta and try this character out.

363
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,395
Speaker 1: No, it came out of beta today.

364
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:49,960
Speaker 1: What are you reading?

365
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:50,864
Speaker 0: I'm reading.

366
00:25:50,905 --> 00:25:52,256
Speaker 0: this article is from September.

367
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,421
Speaker 1: Yes.

368
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:55,916
Speaker 1: The news is that this character is in beta.

369
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:56,640
Speaker 1: If you didn't play on the Switch...

370
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,960
Speaker 0: Because you couldn't play the beta on the Switch.

371
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:02,500
Speaker 1: If you weren't playing on the Switch and you played on Steam, then you could play the beta version.

372
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,020
Speaker 1: You would have had this character for quite a while now.

373
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,420
Speaker 0: There was a period when there were screenshots of the character and stuff, but it wasn't available in beta on Steam.

374
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:14,919
Speaker 1: It was released officially today, so stupid people playing a card game on the Switch, like Rym, can now play this.

375
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:15,320
Speaker 1: finally.

376
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,179
Speaker 1: Even though everyone else has been playing with this character for months on the PC.

377
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,244
Speaker 0: But, here's my warning.

378
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:22,980
Speaker 0: In a game like this, you don't want to play betas because they tweak the game a lot.

379
00:26:24,442 --> 00:26:27,154
Speaker 1: I played beta for the time when I played it.

380
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:28,380
Speaker 1: I played beta and it was just fine.

381
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,572
Speaker 0: Have you seen all the changes they made to the game?

382
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,640
Speaker 0: How many cards were just broken and all this nonsense?

383
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:36,620
Speaker 1: There was never any major brokenness when I was playing beta.

384
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:38,309
Speaker 0: There was tons of brokenness.

385
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,480
Speaker 0: Have you ever looked at the release notes for this game?

386
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,260
Speaker 1: Yes, I played the beta for many months before you even played the game for the first time.

387
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,540
Speaker 1: And there was never any significant problems and no reason to go play the standard version.

388
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,060
Speaker 1: Everyone played on beta and everyone on PC still plays on beta.

389
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,413
Speaker 0: Okay.

390
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,564
Speaker 1: Also, there's another news.

391
00:26:57,186 --> 00:27:02,120
Speaker 1: Is that The Root Guy, Cole Worley, and Letter Games, the people that published The Root?

392
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:04,240
Speaker 1: They've had this game coming for a while.

393
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:04,880
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, Oath.

394
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,646
Speaker 1: They had this game Oath that's been coming for a while.

395
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:12,520
Speaker 1: They've been posting developer blog posts telling you all about how they made the game.

396
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,880
Speaker 1: They've been doing Twitch streams and YouTube vids showing you how the game works.

397
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,528
Speaker 1: They've been all about telling everyone and showing it.

398
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:21,739
Speaker 1: It's exactly what I tell video game companies to do.

399
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,364
Speaker 1: Just be open.

400
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:27,480
Speaker 1: Show everything that's going on and that will make people more excited.

401
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,885
Speaker 1: It won't cost you sales.

402
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:33,180
Speaker 1: You don't have to keep everything a secret and reveal it at the last second like Apple.

403
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,651
Speaker 1: If Apple just told everyone this is the things we worked on today.

404
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:38,960
Speaker 1: every single day, people would be more excited.

405
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,700
Speaker 1: And here's proof, at least one example of proof, by being super open about everything that's going on with this game.

406
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,126
Speaker 1: People would be crazy excited to play it.

407
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:51,280
Speaker 1: And today the Kickstarter went live and it funded in like seven minutes.

408
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:57,100
Speaker 1: There's only one level you can kick, which is $90, but that gets you a ton, a ton of shit.

409
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:01,681
Speaker 1: And the game is a big ass game, totally worth $90.

410
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:06,820
Speaker 1: And the way this game works is it's sort of legacy, but not really sort of legacy, right?

411
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:15,460
Speaker 1: The legacy games we've had so far are games where you have to play a set number of times, preferably with the same exact people, same number of people.

412
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:18,133
Speaker 1: And you permanently change the game as you go on.

413
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,260
Speaker 1: And then the game is sort of done.

414
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:24,300
Speaker 1: The way Oath works is you bust it out and play it with one to six players.

415
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,440
Speaker 1: It has a starting configuration and then the game is over and someone wins.

416
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,540
Speaker 1: But then you put it back in the box in a particular way.

417
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,180
Speaker 1: And then when you set it up again, you set it up in a particular way.

418
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,419
Speaker 0: Because you've changed the world.

419
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:45,120
Speaker 1: And now you just have a different starting position for the next game, even if the next game only has one player or six players or four completely new players.

420
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:50,640
Speaker 1: You can also reset the game back to its original condition just by reordering some cards or whatever.

421
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,679
Speaker 1: You can learn the details if you watch some videos about it.

422
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,339
Speaker 1: I'm not going to explain them here.

423
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,941
Speaker 0: Or link.

424
00:28:55,961 --> 00:29:01,800
Speaker 0: Because if you Google for Oath game, there's a different Kickstarter for this action MMORPG.

425
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,164
Speaker 1: This is the game.

426
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:05,176
Speaker 1: You can tell because it has root style art.

427
00:29:05,216 --> 00:29:05,900
Speaker 1: You can't miss it.

428
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,800
Speaker 0: If you see something like action RPG look like MMO nonsense, that's not the game we're talking about.

429
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,953
Speaker 1: They're planning to deliver this game a year from now.

430
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:14,019
Speaker 1: I totally believe them.

431
00:29:15,082 --> 00:29:15,937
Speaker 0: They're already at almost 500k.

432
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, my only concern is if, like root, there were various patches and expansions.

433
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:28,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really glad I didn't buy root when it came out because they've made a ton of patches to the game.

434
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,700
Speaker 0: This is why you don't play games in beta.

435
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,960
Speaker 1: But I'm expecting this to not have that sort of thing and not need a 2.0.

436
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,356
Speaker 0: Well, because it doesn't need as much balance because it's a different thing.

437
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,390
Speaker 1: It's not right, so I'm like, alright, I'll buy this.

438
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,920
Speaker 1: If there's any expansions or things, I'm only going to get them if we play this a lot.

439
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:47,159
Speaker 1: But yeah, there you go.

440
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,320
Speaker 0: I'm pretty excited about it.

441
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,179
Speaker 1: Get on that Oath train.

442
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:58,500
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's time for... Things of the Day!

443
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:01,440
Speaker 0: So, Scott's got this video about Flushing.

444
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, not Flushing, New York.

445
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:04,440
Speaker 1: Queens.

446
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,230
Speaker 1: So, some company.

447
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,140
Speaker 1: What's the name of this company?

448
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:10,700
Speaker 0: The YouTube channel is Metacraft Het.

449
00:30:11,264 --> 00:30:13,459
Speaker 1: Okay, some sort of company that makes things.

450
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, the high abuse Metacraft stainless steel toilet.

451
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,577
Speaker 1: Right, so this company, I guess, is a stainless steel works of some kind?

452
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:22,220
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

453
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:23,580
Speaker 1: But they made this toilet.

454
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:25,940
Speaker 0: A high abuse toilet.

455
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:29,080
Speaker 1: It is a toilet that can flush fucking anything without clogging.

456
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:32,660
Speaker 1: And in this video, they show you the various things they flush.

457
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:40,460
Speaker 0: Five pounds of gummy bears, a twelve inch chocolate long john, two and a half pounds of carrots, seven tampons with applicators.

458
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,540
Speaker 1: And wrappers.

459
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,177
Speaker 1: Right, this toilet flushes anything.

460
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,580
Speaker 1: My only concern is that, you know, they just hooked up this toilet to basically a water pipe and I guess some sort of bucket.

461
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:56,120
Speaker 1: If you look this up to the actual sewer system, right, obviously the sewer pipes are quite large and that won't be a problem.

462
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,511
Speaker 0: Well, sewer pipes by nature get larger the further in you go.

463
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:06,720
Speaker 1: Obviously, but the pipe that attaches directly to the toilet is at its, you know, least diameter.

464
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,040
Speaker 1: Lowest radius.

465
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:24,240
Speaker 1: If that pipe in your house, depending on your house, if the narrowest sewer pipe that connects directly to the output of the toilet is not wide enough, then, and you try to flush six hundred acorns, you might be in trouble no matter how hard the toilet pushes.

466
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:30,000
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if this is actually a realistic, real world use toilet.

467
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:33,300
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's just a demonstration to show the power of the toilet.

468
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,739
Speaker 1: Yes, the toilet is quite powerful.

469
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,460
Speaker 0: This is the toilet you put in like a prison.

470
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:37,323
Speaker 1: Sure.

471
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,651
Speaker 1: But yeah, it is quite amazing.

472
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:42,160
Speaker 1: It won't clog, which is, I guess, a really great feature.

473
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,667
Speaker 0: Oh, this great YouTube comment.

474
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:46,160
Speaker 0: This will be good if I ever crap out six hundred acorns.

475
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:46,841
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.

476
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:53,140
Speaker 1: My only, the only thing is, uh, who's crapping out six hundred acorns?

477
00:31:53,383 --> 00:31:53,469
Speaker 1: Yeah.

478
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,883
Speaker 1: It's unnecessary.

479
00:31:55,123 --> 00:32:01,460
Speaker 1: But I was surprised that I thought, oh, this probably uses like five gallons per flush or something crazy like that.

480
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,608
Speaker 1: No, it's actually only one point something gallon.

481
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:06,880
Speaker 1: So not only a little bit more than your average toilet or whatever.

482
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:07,440
Speaker 1: Yeah.

483
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:16,520
Speaker 1: And I think if you modified this to have like the two different buttons, like the normal button and the crazy button, like a lot of toilets have these days, that then it could be reasonable.

484
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,386
Speaker 1: Like, oh, listen, I just peed and did a little poop.

485
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:19,329
Speaker 0: Small button.

486
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,717
Speaker 1: There's six hundred acorns in here.

487
00:32:21,878 --> 00:32:22,460
Speaker 1: Large button.

488
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:23,564
Speaker 0: Now, I didn't look at this.

489
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,540
Speaker 0: I don't know if it has like a UNEC in it or if it relies on special sewage stuff.

490
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,847
Speaker 0: And it also doesn't have a tank.

491
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:30,959
Speaker 0: It needs like pressurized water, it looks like.

492
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:33,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it's not a tank based thing.

493
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:33,736
Speaker 0: Yeah.

494
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,860
Speaker 1: This is more like a public toilet, right, where you just push the lever and it goes with it.

495
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,781
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is, you've probably seen a bunch of old timey footage of New York City from like 1911.

496
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:47,160
Speaker 1: I've seen this particular footage that you're showing.

497
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,520
Speaker 0: Well, you've seen some pieces of this footage because this was all cut together from a bunch of different archival sources.

498
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't be sure I've seen all of it, but a lot of it looks very familiar.

499
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,101
Speaker 0: Yeah.

500
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:57,040
Speaker 0: The problem is, if you watch archival footage, a lot of it looks familiar.

501
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,017
Speaker 1: This is only so much.

502
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:02,440
Speaker 0: But this is some very high quality footage of New York City.

503
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,500
Speaker 0: It's a trip around New York City from 1911.

504
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:16,520
Speaker 0: But they did something clever because a problem with looking at old time footage is that our brains look at it and it feels either unreal or it feels old timey.

505
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,169
Speaker 0: And it makes it hard to place it in the context of.

506
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,000
Speaker 0: that was a real place in color with real people living normal lives.

507
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,401
Speaker 1: Right.

508
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:26,500
Speaker 1: There's the lack of color, but there's also the speed just because of the way old cameras work.

509
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Speaker 0: It's flickery and stuttery and it's too fast and too slow and there's no sound.

510
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,639
Speaker 0: So what they did, it's a subtle change, but they stabilized it.

511
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:38,780
Speaker 0: They got rid of the flicker and they made it speed accurate.

512
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:43,304
Speaker 0: So it's at the actual speed of this day in 1911.

513
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:44,800
Speaker 0: And they added sound fully.

514
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,939
Speaker 0: That's like obviously not super realistic, but realistic enough.

515
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:49,340
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of a wooga.

516
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,420
Speaker 0: And I've never seen footage of like an old city with all those factors that makes it feel so relevant and real.

517
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Speaker 0: And it is almost, it's so weird to watch it because like this one random thing I just got to.

518
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,359
Speaker 0: I know where that fence, that fence is the same fence as there today.

519
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,491
Speaker 0: And people sit there the same way.

520
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:11,482
Speaker 0: they sat there in 1911.

521
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,179
Speaker 0: The only difference is back then there was this elevated train that we got rid of.

522
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:18,120
Speaker 0: There's some cars around, but the cars are not faster than the horses.

523
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,120
Speaker 0: There's more horses than cars.

524
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,940
Speaker 0: And my favorite moment is many times you see the footage cut away suddenly.

525
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,420
Speaker 0: And right before it cuts away there's some kid who like walks over and sees the camera.

526
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
Speaker 0: And is clearly about to go fuck with the camera.

527
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,478
Speaker 1: Right, well I mean cameras are super relatively rare then.

528
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,938
Speaker 1: So the kid sees one and at a time when there's no video games.

529
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,116
Speaker 0: You see a lot of people look at it and are like, "Hey, ooh, camera,

530
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:41,378
Speaker 0: ah.".

531
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:46,880
Speaker 0: The other cool thing is you see a ferry go into a ferry terminal that we don't use anymore.

532
00:34:46,981 --> 00:34:49,918
Speaker 0: But that you see anytime you ride in a ferry on the East River.

533
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:51,960
Speaker 0: This building here, you know this thing?

534
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

535
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,900
Speaker 0: Like it's not used anymore, but it looks literally the same now as it did then.

536
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,340
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised if that same old...

537
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:02,820
Speaker 1: Wait another hundred years and people watch footage of us on YouTube right now talking.

538
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,954
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Wow, look at those old fashioned dudes

539
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:05,739
Speaker 1: podcasting.".

540
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, old timey dudes.

541
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,179
Speaker 0: Why do people use, what's that thing they're talking into?

542
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,278
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised if this ladder's still there.

543
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,540
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, we've been at a lot of conventions.

544
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,920
Speaker 0: So check our YouTube channels for videos of some of the panels we've done.

545
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,860
Speaker 0: But this weekend we're going to PAX South.

546
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,817
Speaker 1: The Southern PAX.

547
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,240
Speaker 0: And at the Southern PAX on, when is our panel?

548
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,993
Speaker 0: Friday at 4 p.m.

549
00:35:33,013 --> 00:35:33,780
Speaker 0: in the Bobcat Theater.

550
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,960
Speaker 0: We're doing an all new panel.

551
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,130
Speaker 0: We've done the 47 Club Games.

552
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,830
Speaker 0: It's 100% new.

553
00:35:38,907 --> 00:35:39,178
Speaker 0: It is.

554
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:40,780
Speaker 0: I mean, you've seen the slides.

555
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,059
Speaker 1: It is not a new idea, so therefore it is not new.

556
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:43,620
Speaker 1: Okay.

557
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,155
Speaker 0: Anyway, it is.

558
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,880
Speaker 0: We've done this panel, the 40 Tabletop Games You Should Play.

559
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, you just said it's an all new panel.

560
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,280
Speaker 1: Then you just said we've done this panel.

561
00:35:52,300 --> 00:36:04,320
Speaker 0: No, we've done this panel, the 40 Tabletop Games You Should Play, which is about if you want to understand what tabletop games are, and you want to be a broad-minded person who, it's not even all games we like.

562
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,160
Speaker 0: If you want to experience what tabletop has to offer, here are 40 games that will put you in 40 radically different directions.

563
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:12,607
Speaker 0: It's sort of like a list of.

564
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,977
Speaker 0: we think you should play all these games, have a broader understanding of games.

565
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,920
Speaker 0: This one does not include even one game from that list.

566
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,544
Speaker 0: Instead, it is.

567
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:25,838
Speaker 0: here are 41 games that we personally think you should play because they're neat for some specific reason.

568
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:31,840
Speaker 0: The rationale is, I mean, if you could submit panels, your panels never get accepted, so I don't know what to tell you.

569
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, because my panels are meaningful content and not just clickbait.

570
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:40,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you still put a clickbait title because that's the only way to get people in the room.

571
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,100
Speaker 1: Meaningful content is not so popular because people are anti-intellectual.

572
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,320
Speaker 0: I think this content is equally meaningful, though.

573
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:47,839
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so at all.

574
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,125
Speaker 0: Okay.

575
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:50,800
Speaker 1: I think this is like a BuzzFeed list garbage.

576
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,238
Speaker 0: So, you don't believe that anyone can ever give anyone a recommendation on what games they should play?

577
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:55,740
Speaker 0: Ever?

578
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:59,620
Speaker 1: I believe that this kind of content is low brow and low effort.

579
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,780
Speaker 0: That curated collections, like say, I don't know, First Look, have no value on this Earth?

580
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:05,739
Speaker 1: First Look has value in that.

581
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:07,120
Speaker 0: It's just a curated collection.

582
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:09,720
Speaker 0: It's just, here's six newish games you should play.

583
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,220
Speaker 1: The curation is not the value.

584
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
Speaker 1: The value is you cannot get these games.

585
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,820
Speaker 1: Here are games that you cannot otherwise play and are unavailable.

586
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,540
Speaker 0: I would argue that the curation is more the value because they don't bring the obviously crappy games to First Look.

587
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:26,118
Speaker 1: All right, so instead of First Look, what if they just had tables set up of all kinds of games?

588
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Speaker 0: That would be fantastic.

589
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:38,760
Speaker 0: If there was an area that is set up the same way as First Look, but it wasn't new games, it's old games, but it's a curated collection of games that people should check out and learn and play with teachers.

590
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,580
Speaker 0: Would you ever go in that area to play a game?

591
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,077
Speaker 0: Hell yeah.

592
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:41,700
Speaker 1: I would not.

593
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,320
Speaker 1: There is no reason for me to go in that area.

594
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,078
Speaker 0: Okay.

595
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:47,680
Speaker 0: So you don't ever want anyone to recommend a game to you, apparently?

596
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:48,899
Speaker 1: I know what's good.

597
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:50,218
Speaker 0: Do you?

598
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:51,460
Speaker 1: I do.

599
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,538
Speaker 1: That's why you're listening to me.

600
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,480
Speaker 0: But you're the one who always tells people not to listen to you.

601
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you think there's no value in listening to me, go away.

602
00:37:58,341 --> 00:37:59,259
Speaker 1: What are you doing here?

603
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:07,859
Speaker 1: By the fact that you're listening to this, that is an admission that what I have to say is something you believe in and is worth hearing, which means you believe I'm right just by listening.

604
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,060
Speaker 1: So if you don't believe that I'm right, go away.

605
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:11,280
Speaker 0: Okay, Old Man Scott.

606
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,959
Speaker 1: That's the only way to prove that I'm wrong is to not listen to me.

607
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,659
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're admitting I'm worth listening to, and I know more than you.

608
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:20,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, moving on from Old Man Scott.

609
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,357
Speaker 0: We will also be at PAX East.

610
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,499
Speaker 0: It's going to be a good time.

611
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:26,159
Speaker 0: And this is the last episode we're ever going to record with...

612
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,700
Speaker 1: That's the last episode we're ever going to record.

613
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:35,620
Speaker 0: The old Mackie mixer that I bought in 2013 to replace an even older mixer that broke.

614
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,189
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

615
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,160
Speaker 1: So... Rem loves spending the money.

616
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,460
Speaker 0: No, I do not.

617
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,180
Speaker 1: It ain't broke.

618
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,839
Speaker 1: Don't fix it.

619
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:42,060
Speaker 0: Well, it is broke.

620
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,737
Speaker 0: The problem is...

621
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:43,377
Speaker 1: How broke is it?

622
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,158
Speaker 1: One... We're recording with it right now.

623
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:46,734
Speaker 1: How broke can it be?

624
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,560
Speaker 0: So, one of the preamps doesn't work anymore at all.

625
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,318
Speaker 1: Well, we're not using that one.

626
00:38:50,782 --> 00:38:51,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm missing one.

627
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:55,560
Speaker 0: Two, the auxiliary bus is an analog pipeline, which kind of sucks.

628
00:38:55,721 --> 00:39:00,400
Speaker 0: And, you know, I have to keep fussing with the OBS stream so the volume's equal.

629
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,460
Speaker 0: I got this giant compressor I want to get out of my house because I don't want analog pipelines anymore.

630
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:06,659
Speaker 0: The new one is tiny.

631
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,080
Speaker 0: The new one costs a third what the Mackie costs.

632
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,500
Speaker 0: And, holy shit, the preamps on this new thing are, like, night and day.

633
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:15,299
Speaker 0: And most importantly, the new thing?

634
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:24,200
Speaker 0: Dead at USB-C, meaning I can take the PCI Express FireWire card that barely works and sometimes crashes my computer.

635
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:32,619
Speaker 0: I will go from one legacy FireWire device in my life to FireWire does not exist in my life anymore.

636
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:39,180
Speaker 1: It is good to see that, thanks to USB-C, the audio companies are now producing a lot of USB-C audio equipment.

637
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:45,720
Speaker 0: Because 90% of USB audio devices can take, at most, two digital inputs, meaning they're literally worthless.

638
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,219
Speaker 1: It looks like you bought some kind of PreSonus thing.

639
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:48,700
Speaker 1: PreSonus is a real good brand.

640
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:58,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw in the forum this company, Solid State, which has no relation to Ghost in the Shell, they're usually known for making, like, the enormous boards you see in music studios.

641
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, like, Mackie makes those, too.

642
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,280
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm saying, like, they're, like, one of the top makers of those.

643
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:06,780
Speaker 1: Like, you know, like, real music people are like, oh, yeah, that's a good one.

644
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

645
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,759
Speaker 1: They've made really tiny USB-C things that are, like, good for, like, two microphone, two headphone.

646
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:18,320
Speaker 1: It's like, if you're starting a podcast today, that thing is something you should check out.

647
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,880
Speaker 1: Like, that is, you know, real good.

648
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,160
Speaker 1: It's USB-C, two headphone, two microphone.

649
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:22,265
Speaker 1: Yep.

650
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,260
Speaker 1: What else do you need?

651
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:23,618
Speaker 1: Nothing.

652
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,113
Speaker 0: Yep.

653
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,000
Speaker 0: We need more microphones, because sometimes we have listeners on the show, or, like, we have guests on the show and stuff.

654
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one you bought is what, like, four, eight?

655
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:35,999
Speaker 0: It's four by default, but it has eight at input, so I could actually put, like, another eight onto it if I needed to.

656
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:36,459
Speaker 0: Right.

657
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,240
Speaker 1: Oh, you can add on more, like, with another?

658
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:39,080
Speaker 0: I can add on more, yeah.

659
00:40:39,264 --> 00:40:39,539
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

660
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,160
Speaker 1: But, yeah, well, I mean...

661
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:50,620
Speaker 0: Because you can't use two different sound devices unless they are synced, and that is something that most people, like you listening, probably don't know what that is or how that works, and that is not worth learning.

662
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,719
Speaker 1: We don't need to talk about that now.

663
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,054
Speaker 0: Yeah.

664
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,659
Speaker 0: So, I'll be interesting to see what Geek Night sounds like, because I have to make a whole new pipeline, but I'm kind of excited, because...

665
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,980
Speaker 1: I'd be interested if anyone could tell blindly.

666
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,360
Speaker 0: Mostly, the only benefit will simply be that I will have...

667
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,580
Speaker 1: It takes up less room in your room.

668
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:08,700
Speaker 0: A lot less room in my room, good lord.

669
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,160
Speaker 0: It'll also use a lot less power.

670
00:41:10,523 --> 00:41:10,919
Speaker 1: That's good.

671
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:20,600
Speaker 0: And it's small and USB-C, so if we do, like, a big video at Scott's house, or, like, on the field, I can just bring this and put a whole bunch of microphones for a video.

672
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:23,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we want to get the output into the camera to get the...

673
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,480
Speaker 0: There's a lot of really easy ways to do that.

674
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,720
Speaker 1: There's some desync between our mouths flapping.

675
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,459
Speaker 0: That is not a problem with modern equipment, and also, I have XLR in on my camcorder, which makes an easy sync.

676
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:42,600
Speaker 0: So, I'm real excited to set this up, because there will be zero analog... I can throw away my insert cables.

677
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,619
Speaker 0: If you don't know what an insert cable is, thank Satan.

678
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,500
Speaker 0: And in the last Metamoment, the Book Club book is The Tale of Genji.

679
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:48,458
Speaker 1: I am reading it.

680
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:49,860
Speaker 0: I'm also reading it.

681
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:56,319
Speaker 0: I am learning all the myriad ways that Genji's kind of a dick, and it's kind of... I don't know if I like Genji so far.

682
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,160
Speaker 0: I hope this is the tale of Genji being better.

683
00:41:59,761 --> 00:42:01,119
Speaker 1: It's the tale of Genji, for sure.

684
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,660
Speaker 1: It's the only thing that is a tale about.

685
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:04,039
Speaker 0: There's three ways this could go.

686
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:14,140
Speaker 0: It's the tale of Genji being better, it's the tale of Genji being shitty to the end, or it's the tale of Genji getting his comeuppance.

687
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,560
Speaker 1: I think I remember, for being the first novel, I think it was more like a serial.

688
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:20,400
Speaker 1: I don't think there was an overarching plan from the start.

689
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,900
Speaker 1: It was written over such a long period.

690
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,059
Speaker 0: I hope Genji just dies a third of the way, too, and is never mentioned again, and it just keeps going.

691
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:34,399
Speaker 1: I get the feeling that there's people whose entire job is being a scholar of this book, but I get the feeling that it was just sort of made up as they went along.

692
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:46,320
Speaker 0: Kind of like how, when I first read, when I was young, The Count of Monte Cristo, I didn't know how it ended, and reading a really, really long serial can be pretty fun if you literally, honestly don't know where it's going.

693
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,680
Speaker 1: Well, also, from what I've heard, it doesn't necessarily end.

694
00:42:49,940 --> 00:43:05,359
Speaker 1: It just sort of- Well, no, there's a chapter, spoilers, way late towards the end, like Genji is no more, and then there's a couple chapters of the people who are still around, like maybe his kids or something, I don't know.

695
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,977
Speaker 1: And then it ends abruptly, I guess, when the author died, or when we couldn't get any more, or I don't know.

696
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:11,797
Speaker 1: I don't know.

697
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:12,638
Speaker 1: Something like that.

698
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:15,919
Speaker 0: I feel like it's just the one piece of its era.

699
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it was also the first one.

700
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:23,279
Speaker 1: You can't be the one piece of your era if you're the first one.

701
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,320
Speaker 1: One piece is the tale of Genji of this era.

702
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:26,721
Speaker 1: So,

703
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:31,773
Speaker 0: as great as this game is, we don't have to talk about it that long, but we were at PAX Unplugged,

704
00:43:32,378 --> 00:43:38,302
Speaker 1: and- Well, even before PAX Unplugged, a lot of the enforcers, you know, they scouted out at BGG Con, which was just- To make

705
00:43:38,342 --> 00:43:41,360
Speaker 0: a curated collection to recommend to you what games to play?

706
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:44,060
Speaker 1: No, to get new games that are otherwise unattainable.

707
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:50,700
Speaker 1: They went to Essen and BGG Con, and the game they raved about that was new and unattainable was Nekosu Dice.

708
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:54,660
Speaker 0: So, first look at Unplugged- It was sitting there next to Goats and Goats.

709
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,811
Speaker 1: Right there, Goats and Goats.

710
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:56,459
Speaker 1: There it was.

711
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,620
Speaker 0: And I'm like- Oh yeah, Oats and Goats is the speedrunner.

712
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,220
Speaker 0: Goat and Goat is the goat game.

713
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,581
Speaker 1: Yes.

714
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,920
Speaker 1: So, I go and I'm like, well, that's the game.

715
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:04,792
Speaker 1: I can't play otherwise.

716
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:05,659
Speaker 1: Let's play it.

717
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:09,459
Speaker 1: And we read it, and oh yep, it is definitely the bomb.

718
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:11,380
Speaker 0: Then we played it, and it's telling.

719
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,880
Speaker 0: 'Cause I kept taking people over there and teaching it to them.

720
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,720
Speaker 0: I was sitting there teaching random people to play it at one point.

721
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:22,240
Speaker 0: I've never played a game in first look like that many times before.

722
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,759
Speaker 0: 'Cause usually I go to first look, I play a game- Usually it's hard to get into first look.

723
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but once I play a game in first look, it's like, okay, I know the deal.

724
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,900
Speaker 0: And then I just buy the game or something.

725
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,619
Speaker 0: But there were a lot of other games I could've played at PAX.

726
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,760
Speaker 0: I kept going back over to play Nekosu Dice with different people.

727
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,730
Speaker 0: So, here's the pitch.

728
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:39,120
Speaker 0: It is a trick-taking card game.

729
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,980
Speaker 1: A lot like, you know, Euchre Hearts, Wizard, Bridge, one of those.

730
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,920
Speaker 0: So first, I'm gonna explain it very briefly, the way I would explain it to someone who knows trick-taking games.

731
00:44:48,341 --> 00:44:50,019
Speaker 0: It's a trick-taking game with Trump.

732
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,560
Speaker 0: You bid on how many tricks you're gonna take, but there's a mechanism for that bidding.

733
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,966
Speaker 0: You have to follow suit.

734
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:58,339
Speaker 0: You don't have to, Trump, unless you want to.

735
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:01,499
Speaker 0: But, you get a hand of cards.

736
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:07,540
Speaker 0: And then you draft a bunch of dice, and the dice have the same set of suits as the cards.

737
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:11,580
Speaker 0: So, my hand might be the four of blue and the two of white and the three of yellow.

738
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,960
Speaker 0: And in front of me, I might have rolled a three of yellow and another three of yellow and a six of blue.

739
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,019
Speaker 1: The cards go-- And then when it comes around to my turn to play a card into the trick, I could play a card or a die.

740
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,994
Speaker 0: Scott leads a blue six.

741
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:25,740
Speaker 0: That's a die.

742
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:27,213
Speaker 0: I play a blue four.

743
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:27,899
Speaker 0: That's a card.

744
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,074
Speaker 0: Emily plays a blue two.

745
00:45:30,175 --> 00:45:30,840
Speaker 0: That's a die.

746
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:31,940
Speaker 0: Like, that's the game.

747
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,281
Speaker 1: Right.

748
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:35,100
Speaker 1: Well, also, the cards go from one to seven.

749
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:36,139
Speaker 0: Zero to seven.

750
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,911
Speaker 1: Zero to seven.

751
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,007
Speaker 0: Zero to seven.

752
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:40,899
Speaker 1: And the dice go-- And the dice go, obviously, one to six.

753
00:45:42,203 --> 00:45:50,359
Speaker 1: So, if you roll out, if you've got a six yellow die in front of you, and you push it out, someone plays a yellow seven, it's like, well, no dice is going to beat that.

754
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:54,060
Speaker 0: So, here are the other thing, like, the final pieces of this.

755
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,620
Speaker 0: This is, like, the unique part of the game.

756
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,416
Speaker 1: Well, you've got to remember that "nokosu" in Japanese, I guess, means

757
00:45:58,497 --> 00:45:59,000
Speaker 1: "leftover."

758
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:01,299
Speaker 1: It's all about the leftover dice, right?

759
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,080
Speaker 1: So, when you draft, you start by shaking up all the dice and spilling them out.

760
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,780
Speaker 0: You take a few away, and then you shake up the rest.

761
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,539
Speaker 1: Everyone starts with two random dice, but then you shake the rest.

762
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,986
Speaker 0: Well, not all the rest.

763
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:13,960
Speaker 0: You pull a few out, so it's a little different every time.

764
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,120
Speaker 1: You shake the rest that you're going to use, and everyone takes them one at a time in a draft, right?

765
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,140
Speaker 1: And the one that's left over is Trump.

766
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,160
Speaker 1: Whatever number and color that die is is Trump.

767
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,960
Speaker 1: So, if the blue three is left over, blue is Trump, and three is Trump.

768
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,800
Speaker 0: The best way to think of it is that all threes are now also blue.

769
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,800
Speaker 1: Yep, except for the blue three, which is now god tier.

770
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:38,860
Speaker 0: So, there are some games that have superior and inferior Trump.

771
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:52,252
Speaker 1: If you made a video game out of this, what you would do is, if Trump turned out to be blue three, suddenly all the blue cards and all the threes would turn gold, and the blue threes would turn crazy, right?

772
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:54,340
Speaker 1: Like on fire with sparkles, right?

773
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,320
Speaker 1: Because now they're all in the same suit together.

774
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,960
Speaker 1: So, even a yellow three would be in the same suit as a blue two, or a blue one, or a blue seven.

775
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,140
Speaker 0: Now, if you've played a lot of trick-taking games that have complex Trump, then this game, it's not a problem.

776
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:17,080
Speaker 0: We saw people who have not played games with complex or multifaceted Trumps before had trouble remembering that the twos were blue and the blues were two.

777
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,300
Speaker 1: I think I had a little, only a minor amount of trouble.

778
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:19,763
Speaker 0: It was funny.

779
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,980
Speaker 0: You would fuck it up, and then you would explain the rule to everyone, and then fuck it up again.

780
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,044
Speaker 1: I understand the rule perfectly.

781
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:32,080
Speaker 1: I blame it slightly because we played the original from the box, official Nekosi dice, and I only had a tiny bit of trouble.

782
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,348
Speaker 1: We only messed it up a little bit.

783
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:39,180
Speaker 0: Obviously, the game is- I made an AirSats version of this game out of some Shik'El cards and a bunch of dice.

784
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,366
Speaker 1: The game isn't out yet, right?

785
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:45,580
Speaker 1: Actually, there was a pre-order that sold out within a day.

786
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,800
Speaker 0: Now there's another pre-order.

787
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,960
Speaker 1: There's going to be another pre-order tomorrow.

788
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:50,700
Speaker 0: I'm getting in on it.

789
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,740
Speaker 1: We'll post the link for that pre-order for anybody if you can go fast enough.

790
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,040
Speaker 0: If it's not clear how excited we are, this game is a must-buy.

791
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:57,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's going to be super cheap.

792
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,020
Speaker 1: But anyway, we played with Rims hacked together copy using whatever dice-.

793
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,920
Speaker 0: Now I know what you're about to say, but I looked at the pictures of the real cards and real dice and my copy.

794
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,280
Speaker 0: There is no material difference.

795
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't tell you a specific difference between them.

796
00:48:13,296 --> 00:48:19,780
Speaker 1: that was meaningful, but we did mess it up more with the put together copy than the original one.

797
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,628
Speaker 0: I think I figured out why.

798
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,740
Speaker 0: I was thinking about that a lot.

799
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,379
Speaker 1: When we were playing it in first look- I can't tell you why because it looks the same to me.

800
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,819
Speaker 0: When we were playing it in first look, we played it super slow because we had all just learned it.

801
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,617
Speaker 0: And every time we played it, we played it again super slow and everyone was paying 100% attention.

802
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,700
Speaker 0: And at MagFest, I just kept buzzing out on the table all the time.

803
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
Speaker 0: I played it like seven or eight times.

804
00:48:42,681 --> 00:48:43,092
Speaker 0: You could be.

805
00:48:43,112 --> 00:48:43,400
Speaker 1: Who knows?

806
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,120
Speaker 0: And I kept playing it with random groups of people, but we played it more like we play wizard or like normal games.

807
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,440
Speaker 0: Like people would get distracted or talk to each other.

808
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:55,360
Speaker 1: You deal out the cards, you get two random dice, you draft the rest of the dice.

809
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:55,960
Speaker 1: The last die.

810
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:04,680
Speaker 1: When you're drafting, there is an odd number of dice such that there is going to be one die left over after everyone is drafted.

811
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,860
Speaker 1: That die is the Trump die.

812
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:13,620
Speaker 1: Then you play the game and what happens is the leftover dice.

813
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,360
Speaker 0: So you've got five dice in front of you and a head of cards.

814
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,770
Speaker 1: You start taking tricks, right, as you would.

815
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:20,940
Speaker 1: a normal trick-taking game, must follow suit.

816
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,839
Speaker 1: So if I play blue, everyone has to play blue if they have it, otherwise they don't.

817
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:30,760
Speaker 1: And if you don't, you can play Trump unless Trump was led, in which case follow with Trump.

818
00:49:31,441 --> 00:49:39,600
Speaker 1: If a lot of situations come up where you don't want to follow and you don't have a card to follow with, but you have a die to follow with.

819
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,780
Speaker 1: You have to follow with the die because a die is just a card in your hand.

820
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:50,000
Speaker 0: So if I see that Scott's got a yellow die and I'm worried that he might be de-suited, I know he's not de-suited in yellow.

821
00:49:50,200 --> 00:50:00,260
Speaker 1: Well, if you know that blue is Trump and you see Rim has a bunch of blue dice in front of him, it's like, well, part of everyone's hand is just open, but only part of their hand is open.

822
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,420
Speaker 0: So here's the final magic that makes this work.

823
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,920
Speaker 1: So after you play, you keep taking tricks and eventually at some point, you, each player, will have one die left.

824
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,044
Speaker 1: You don't get to play that die.

825
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:19,140
Speaker 1: That die goes aside and now whatever the number value is on that die, regardless of color, is your bid.

826
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:26,460
Speaker 0: So if Scott has a six and a one in front of him and I play a card that forces him to play the six, his bid becomes one, which might totally fuck him.

827
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,760
Speaker 1: Right, so that bid is you're trying to win exactly that number of tricks.

828
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:37,516
Speaker 1: So if you're winning a lot of tricks, you want to have a die with a high value on it and not use that die.

829
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,100
Speaker 1: You want to set that die aside.

830
00:50:39,442 --> 00:50:42,640
Speaker 1: Also, if you take more than six tricks, you can never be correct.

831
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,320
Speaker 0: Your maximum bid is six, but there are 15 tricks in a round.

832
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
Speaker 0: 14, 14.

833
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:57,360
Speaker 1: Before you start, after you draft, but before you start taking tricks, you can say, hold up, I want to bid zero, in which case you just pick one of your die and set it aside.

834
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,540
Speaker 1: And now you just play the turn normally and you're trying to take zero tricks, but obviously if you take even one, you've missed.

835
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,280
Speaker 0: So the game is not as punishing as Wizard because Wizard, you only get points if your bid was correct.

836
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,940
Speaker 1: When you play a game like Wizard, you need to be correct, but in Wizard you can bid any number, it's way easier.

837
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:16,280
Speaker 1: You need to be exactly correct, otherwise you lose points.

838
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:28,440
Speaker 1: Here, it's way harder to be exactly correct because you have less control over your bid, but if you fail to be exactly right, you still always get one point for trick you take.

839
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:35,140
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay, my bid was wrong, but guess what, I took 10 tricks, 10 points, that's pretty good.

840
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:43,558
Speaker 0: If you bid zero and get zero, you just get 10 points, but if you're the only one who is correct in your bid, you get a ton of bonus points.

841
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,740
Speaker 1: Right, I forget exactly how many.

842
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,031
Speaker 0: I think it's 30, 20, 10, 40, something like that.

843
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:55,140
Speaker 1: So you get 10 bonus points for bidding zero and being correct, on top of the points for being the only person who's correct.

844
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,860
Speaker 1: So if you bid zero and you're the only one who was right, you get a shit ton of points.

845
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:06,860
Speaker 0: If everyone's correct, they just get the tricks they took, so it's more like a traditional trick-taking game in that taking tricks can never hurt you too much.

846
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,932
Speaker 0: It just might deny you bonus points.

847
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,220
Speaker 0: It can't harm you.

848
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:13,940
Speaker 1: But the bonus points are so large that that's how to win.

849
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,800
Speaker 1: You're not going to win if you don't get the bonus points, unless everyone is so good that nobody ever gets bonus points.

850
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,720
Speaker 0: Or everybody always gets bonus points.

851
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,140
Speaker 1: Which means it's the same as everyone never getting bonus points.

852
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:28,820
Speaker 1: If no one ever gets bonus points, then it will just come down to who took the most tricks.

853
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:35,160
Speaker 0: There's one last nuance that makes the game work, because unlike a normal trick-taking game, there can be ties.

854
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,100
Speaker 0: The only other game that can have ties is wizard, or at least major trick-taking games, where multiple wizards get played.

855
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,840
Speaker 0: And wizard who ever played the first of those gets the trick.

856
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:53,000
Speaker 0: In this game, whoever, if there's a tie of what's winning the trick, the last card among the tied cards wins the trick.

857
00:52:53,341 --> 00:52:58,459
Speaker 0: So if Scott plays a super high trump, and I tie his trump, and I go after him, I take it.

858
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,620
Speaker 0: It's easier to take tricks, it's harder to duck.

859
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:08,820
Speaker 1: Right, so there's a lot of difficult situations where, even though people's hands are half open, you just see their dice in front of them.

860
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,064
Speaker 0: More like a third open.

861
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,756
Speaker 0: You have five dice in front of you, and you have ten cards in your hand.

862
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,319
Speaker 1: Let's say blue is trump, and rim starts it off with a yellow too.

863
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,040
Speaker 1: And it's like, alright, I have no yellow, I'm de-suited in yellow, I'm going to play my trump.

864
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:29,360
Speaker 1: And then I look around the table, and I see the person next to me, just has like a fucking way more powerful trump just on their die, facing up.

865
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,340
Speaker 1: If it was wizard or some other trick-taking game, I would have just played my trump, like bam.

866
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,120
Speaker 1: But I can see a card, or a die at least, that beats my trump just right there.

867
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:42,200
Speaker 1: I can just see it, and it's like, well, I guess I'm not playing this.

868
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,220
Speaker 0: Yup, and because, the final piece.

869
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,424
Speaker 1: But it's like, well what are you going to do?

870
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:46,569
Speaker 1: It's like, you wait?

871
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:49,660
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it'll still be there, ready to beat you later.

872
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:55,320
Speaker 1: It's not like it's suddenly going to go, it's like you're going to wait for them to somehow use it before you use yours.

873
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:01,340
Speaker 0: It's like if you're playing wizard, and one person is just playing hand open, and you see the wizard sitting there the whole time.

874
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,586
Speaker 1: It's like, how are you going to beat it?

875
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:04,500
Speaker 1: You see it, that doesn't help you.

876
00:54:05,441 --> 00:54:07,397
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you see it, can you beat it?

877
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:07,679
Speaker 1: No.

878
00:54:09,022 --> 00:54:22,120
Speaker 0: And to make matters even more fun, the trump power order is, first, the item, the card or die, that matches both the color and the face value of the trump, is the super trump.

879
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:22,880
Speaker 1: Right, so yellow.

880
00:54:23,401 --> 00:54:26,278
Speaker 0: We started calling it the bower, named after Euchre.

881
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:32,360
Speaker 1: But anyway, the blue three is trump, therefore there is one card that is the blue three, that is the strongest card.

882
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:39,140
Speaker 1: But there could be several other dice that are also blue threes, that are all equally strong.

883
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:54,020
Speaker 0: So after that, all the things that match the face value of trump, so all the threes, The yellow three, the green three, the red three, all the other threes, They're equally powered, and slightly less powerful than the one that matches both.

884
00:54:54,260 --> 00:55:02,120
Speaker 1: So blue three is the strongest, yellow three, green three, red three are all equally strong to each other, but subservient to the almighty blue three.

885
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,360
Speaker 0: And then it's numbers down from there, so then the blue seven, blue six, blue five, blue four, blue two, blue one, blue zero.

886
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,919
Speaker 1: Anything that's blue that's not a three comes after that.

887
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:17,920
Speaker 0: So all these factors combined make this, like, one of the better trick taking games I have ever played.

888
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:24,019
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, there's just so much going on, you would have to play this for a hell of a long time, with any sort of mastery on it.

889
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,160
Speaker 0: And even if you start to master it.

890
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,560
Speaker 1: But even with the mastery, there's so much, not luck, right?

891
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:36,560
Speaker 1: There is a little bit of luck against the random dice you pull from the bag, the two random dice that are yours and yours alone for each round.

892
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:43,800
Speaker 1: But the draft, you just get such a different game every round, it's completely different what's going on.

893
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine hearts with, like, drafting, like, whoa.

894
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:54,640
Speaker 1: Like, different crazy stuff happens each time, because your different colored dice come out, a different one is trump, a different person goes first.

895
00:55:55,162 --> 00:56:01,040
Speaker 1: You know, you draft differently based on the cards and dice, because you already see your hand and your two starting dice before you start drafting.

896
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:01,432
Speaker 0: Yup.

897
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:06,600
Speaker 1: So that changes everything, so it's like, it's so fresh and does not get stale at all.

898
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,900
Speaker 0: Yup, and this is where credit to the designer, this is a Japanese game, Yusuke Matsumoto is the designer.

899
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,340
Speaker 0: Genius.

900
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:20,120
Speaker 0: And this game, I think, is going to open up a whole, I think a lot of people are going to start designing trick taking games, borrowing from this.

901
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:26,560
Speaker 0: Because my stupid brain had never considered just making dice and using them in a trick taking game like this.

902
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,406
Speaker 1: That's really the genius.

903
00:56:27,446 --> 00:56:29,480
Speaker 1: mechanic is, yeah, the dice are also cards.

904
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, and this game is three or four player only, I feel like it really only works with four.

905
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,960
Speaker 1: I think, you know, I would also only play with four.

906
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,739
Speaker 1: Well, try it with three.

907
00:56:38,902 --> 00:56:39,480
Speaker 1: Three could be okay.

908
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,800
Speaker 0: Because three player hearts is great.

909
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, two and five is right out.

910
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, not even allowed.

911
00:56:43,427 --> 00:56:43,473
Speaker 1: No.

912
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:54,260
Speaker 0: But four player gives this game the opportunity to mod this game in the sense that I feel like you could very easily make this a partnership game and it would be great.

913
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,819
Speaker 1: It could, maybe.

914
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:01,420
Speaker 0: Because Wizard, as much as I love it, you can't easily make it a partnership game for a lot of reasons I don't have time to describe right now.

915
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,400
Speaker 1: I'd rather play a different game that is meant to be a partnership game.

916
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel like this could work as a partnership game.

917
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:08,040
Speaker 0: I want to play with it.

918
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:12,178
Speaker 0: I think a lot of clever people are going to play this game once and go, "Oh,

919
00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:12,500
Speaker 0: shit."

920
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,220
Speaker 0: And you're going to see a lot of games.

921
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,317
Speaker 1: You could literally just say, "All right, play the game normal four

922
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:17,679
Speaker 1: player.".

923
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,060
Speaker 1: And then you add your score to the person across from you and then there's only two teams.

924
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:27,980
Speaker 1: And that's the only change you make is, yeah, you're partners with a person across from you and you add your scores together at the end.

925
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:32,594
Speaker 1: So you could basically have, instead of a 25% chance of winning, you'd have a 50% chance of winning.

926
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:37,179
Speaker 0: But then you've got to also, to make it fun, ban Table Talk and...

927
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:39,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm happy to just play four player.

928
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:41,460
Speaker 1: I don't feel the need to mod anything.

929
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:47,140
Speaker 0: Well, I don't feel the need to mod anytime soon because I am nowhere near being a master of this game.

930
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:47,477
Speaker 0: Not even close.

931
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,363
Speaker 0: Obviously.

932
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:49,557
Speaker 0: Not that I'm even a master of Wizard.

933
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:57,020
Speaker 0: I think I'm near a master at, what, Hearts, Euchre, and the list drops off pretty quick after that when it comes to trick taking games.

934
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,170
Speaker 0: Moo still can't fucking play well.

935
00:58:00,592 --> 00:58:02,200
Speaker 0: My skill in Moo is just random.

936
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,500
Speaker 1: I feel like there's no reason to play Moo if you have an Akosu Dice.

937
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,700
Speaker 0: Well, I think Moo brings different, more things.

938
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:10,494
Speaker 1: Moo is very, I'm not saying it's similar, right?

939
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:11,620
Speaker 1: It is very different and crazy.

940
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,888
Speaker 0: Moo has a more complex trump.

941
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,960
Speaker 0: Moo has a superior and an inferior trump.

942
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,340
Speaker 0: And Moo is a coalition game, but it's coalitions formed in the course of bidding.

943
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:27,820
Speaker 1: I'm aware, but the point is, in terms of, I'm in the mood to play a kind of meaty trick taking game and not just a sort of baby one.

944
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:42,880
Speaker 1: It's like, I'd always rather play Akosu Dice than Moo, so even though they're mechanically not equivalent and there's reasons for them both to exist, there's just no situation where I would feel like playing this kind of game and choose Moo over Akosu Dice.

945
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,420
Speaker 0: See, I would, but I'm way more into trick taking games than you are.

946
00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:48,019
Speaker 1: I'm pretty into trick taking games.

947
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, you won't play Euchre with me.

948
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,719
Speaker 1: No, it's a stupid game.

949
00:58:50,922 --> 00:58:51,338
Speaker 1: Euchre's fine.

950
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,120
Speaker 1: Why would I play Euchre when I can play Akosu Dice?

951
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,639
Speaker 0: You wanna play Wiz?

952
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,145
Speaker 1: No, it's a stupid game.

953
00:58:57,841 --> 00:58:59,119
Speaker 1: I would rather play Akosu Dice than you.

954
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,920
Speaker 1: I would rather, but Akosu Dice is just better and it serves the same purpose.

955
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,777
Speaker 0: So, but I guess the real thing I would say is that...

956
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,240
Speaker 1: You're asking me to go eat at like, you know, McDonald's when it's like, but I have meat right here.

957
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,799
Speaker 1: I could make a delicious burger on the grill.

958
00:59:13,881 --> 00:59:14,959
Speaker 1: Why would I go to McDonald's?

959
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,880
Speaker 0: No, McDonald's would be playing straight Wiz.

960
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,019
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, it's like there's no purpose even though, right?

961
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,699
Speaker 0: No, McDonald's would be playing Go Fish and calling it a trick taking game.

962
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:25,198
Speaker 1: You get the idea.

963
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:35,480
Speaker 0: But I guess in terms of trick taking games, Wizard is still the one to use to get your friends who have never played a trick taking game to try them out and realize they like them.

964
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, Akosu Dice is not an entry level, right?

965
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,440
Speaker 1: You need to understand too many different game thing.

966
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,259
Speaker 1: It's not that it's hard where it's pro gamers only.

967
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,120
Speaker 0: Good Lord, I taught this to someone who didn't know how trick taking games work.

968
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:47,759
Speaker 0: That is real fucking hard to do.

969
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,241
Speaker 1: Right.

970
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:55,460
Speaker 1: It's just that you really, you know, if you want to be able to play this well and not be confused all the time, you know, you learn hearts.

971
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:59,899
Speaker 1: You need to understand just the concepts of drafting and taking.

972
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:08,100
Speaker 1: So it's like if you haven't played any drafting or trick taking games before, go play Sushi Go Seven Wonders, you know, Wizard Hearts.

973
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, go play those to learn.

974
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:11,242
Speaker 1: Right.

975
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:11,765
Speaker 1: It's not.

976
01:00:11,805 --> 01:00:14,620
Speaker 1: this isn't some advanced crazy game only for geniuses.

977
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:22,800
Speaker 1: It's just as the complete entry level can be confusing if you don't have the previous prerequisite knowledge.

978
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,880
Speaker 0: So if I had to say like the minefields or the moods I'm in to play trick taking games, if I want a very pure game, I'll still just go to Hearts.

979
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,710
Speaker 0: Hearts is my go to.

980
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:31,360
Speaker 0: That game is great.

981
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:38,880
Speaker 0: If I want an interesting experience that's really going to pull me in right now, no, Akosu Dice, because there's nothing like it.

982
01:00:39,463 --> 01:00:42,300
Speaker 0: If I want an elevated partnership nonsense game, I'll play Moo.

983
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:48,640
Speaker 0: And if I just want any trick taking game, I'll default to Wizard because Wizard does take more players than Akosu Dice.

984
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's the time to play.

985
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,180
Speaker 1: Wizard is if you have five or six people.

986
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:52,901
Speaker 0: Yeah.

987
01:00:52,922 --> 01:00:57,378
Speaker 0: And honestly, Wizard's not as fun with four players unless it's four people who are semi...

988
01:00:58,261 --> 01:01:01,700
Speaker 1: Wizard is definitely the best with more players because it's fewer rounds.

989
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,375
Speaker 1: When you play Wizard with too few players, there's too many rounds.

990
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:05,080
Speaker 1: It takes too long.

991
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:05,481
Speaker 0: Yep.

992
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:16,700
Speaker 0: Now I do like that, but if I'm going to play Wizard with four players, I kind of want to play Hearts more because Hearts is more pure and despite... Hearts will go faster in the end for a lot of reasons.

993
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,060
Speaker 1: Hearts is way faster.

994
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,386
Speaker 0: Yeah.

995
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:21,520
Speaker 0: Well, unless someone won't take their turn, but that's a different problem.

996
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,953
Speaker 1: How could you not take your turn in Hearts?

997
01:01:23,215 --> 01:01:23,620
Speaker 0: It's so simple.

998
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,483
Speaker 0: I've known some people.

999
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:28,740
Speaker 0: Well, when we played Hearts for money in middle school, some people would take a long time on their turn.

1000
01:01:30,383 --> 01:01:31,549
Speaker 0: We were playing for like pennies.

1001
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:33,739
Speaker 0: We weren't high rollers.

1002
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:43,620
Speaker 0: But Nokozu Dice, like I cannot stress enough, it was for us and for a lot of people in tabletop and first look like the breakout game of PAX Unplugged.

1003
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,590
Speaker 0: I practically guarantee it's going to be in first.

1004
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,200
Speaker 0: look at PAX South and you should go play it.

1005
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,880
Speaker 1: I don't know if it will be, but we'll have our made up copy.

1006
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll bring the Ersatz copy.

1007
01:01:51,783 --> 01:01:53,359
Speaker 1: The pre-order will not have arrived yet.

1008
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:53,811
Speaker 0: Yep.

1009
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,520
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1010
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,660
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1016
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:30,060
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows...

1017
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:37,299
Speaker 0: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are... Why is the Patreon manager taking longer to load than it normally does?

1018
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,131
Speaker 0: Oh, because they've changed the UI.

1019
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,160
Speaker 0: I'll have to look at that later.

1020
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,846
Speaker 0: As I said before, many times I never... Oh no.

1021
01:02:45,249 --> 01:02:46,939
Speaker 0: Maybe I have to read this a different way now.

1022
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,840
Speaker 0: That's the mistake I made by starting this recording.

1023
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,172
Speaker 0: I will never edit this piece.

1024
