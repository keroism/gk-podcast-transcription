1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,662
Speaker 0: It's Thursday April 6th 2023.

2
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:12,292
Speaker 0: I'm rim And this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:16,630
Speaker 0: We were talking about stadiums Colosseum's arenas and the like.

4
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:23,416
Speaker 0: let's do this sir, it's warm today like Shockingly warm.

5
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's it's really.

6
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,673
Speaker 1: it's strange because on the one hand it did get.

7
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:30,340
Speaker 1: you know, this is you know It's not cold, right?

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,237
Speaker 1: I would like it to be warmer, but this is my watch while I was running.

9
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,782
Speaker 0: It was 77 right.

10
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:38,808
Speaker 1: my watch right now says it's 76.

11
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:39,310
Speaker 1: You know what?

12
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:40,513
Speaker 1: That's fine.

13
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:44,382
Speaker 1: That's you know, I'm not gonna complain if it's 76.

14
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:45,466
Speaker 0: You and I are it of a corn.

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,180
Speaker 0: I wanted to be like 84 and sunny and higher.

16
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,346
Speaker 1: The number can't be too high.

17
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:54,840
Speaker 1: There's no number that would be high that I would complain, right?

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,241
Speaker 1: It's good.

19
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:55,482
Speaker 1: We can go.

20
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:00,200
Speaker 1: I can go to the other side the the Sun facing side of mercury and I could be warmer.

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,186
Speaker 0: So I would I know a closer.

22
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:27,367
Speaker 0: what I'm curious about is I would at least once like to be in either Hyderabad or Singapore with you at the height of their summer and I'm just curious to see if your opinion would change because I have been in 120 degree heat and While it didn't kill me I would prefer to not be in that heat for too long unless I'm like in a sauna or on a beach that I can escape from That to somewhere.

23
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:33,219
Speaker 0: that is not that hot Mmm, I think my upper limit of comfort is about a hundred and five if it's dry.

24
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:41,177
Speaker 1: ish Mmm, but I mean, you know, I walked through the desert and I you know, I wasn't upset at all.

25
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:53,523
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, but So the sad thing is I was looking at the weather stuff cuz you know The weather has been more variable for the last several years as we know like anyone who lives can notice that and scientists agree that's true.

26
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:57,985
Speaker 0: it is way more variable and it's solely because of Advancing climate change.

27
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:02,040
Speaker 0: climate change doesn't mean everything gets hotter immediately means everything gets more fucked up and variable.

28
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,368
Speaker 0: But there's talk that at least in the New York City area.

29
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,084
Speaker 0: This is very likely to be the hottest summer ever Recorded.

30
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:15,104
Speaker 0: Yes, and I think Scott and we're gonna treat that I'm gonna treat this the same way.

31
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:18,875
Speaker 0: I treat a tornado because tornadoes cause devastation.

32
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:19,717
Speaker 0: They kill people.

33
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,560
Speaker 0: They are bad news.

34
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:26,120
Speaker 0: But I wish I wish there were no more tornadoes just like I wish there were no more hockey fights.

35
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,609
Speaker 0: But I was at a hockey game last.

36
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,239
Speaker 1: wish there were no more a lot of things.

37
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,797
Speaker 0: There was a hockey fight at the fact there were a lot of hockey many many.

38
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:38,720
Speaker 0: This was the fight in his hockey game I seen in a while in person and for a meaningless game.

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,124
Speaker 1: It was way too fighty, right?

40
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:45,120
Speaker 0: So, uh, I may have stood up and screamed and cheered during those fights.

41
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:50,520
Speaker 0: I might have yelled fuck him up at one point, especially when someone deserved it, which they did.

42
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,771
Speaker 0: Yep, don't hit our goalie in the nuts with your stick.

43
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,380
Speaker 0: that is like that is a sin in hockey.

44
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:01,664
Speaker 1: Well, they got a $5,000 fine But I would.

45
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:06,622
Speaker 0: I would want to watch any hockey fight I can see and to ban hockey fighting immediately if I had the power To do so.

46
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:12,039
Speaker 0: I will watch any tornado in the Midwest from an open garage door sitting on a lawn chair.

47
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,680
Speaker 0: But that is because I did not cause that tornado.

48
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:25,425
Speaker 1: As long as I'm confident enough that I can run and get to the basement if the tornado comes in my direction, yes More than once in my life.

49
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:37,460
Speaker 0: There was the moment of like my mom or my dad say like Pausing for a minute while we're watching it like literally watching a tornado and then saying all right garage doors closing everybody into the basement.

50
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:40,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's too close Coming this way.

51
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:42,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would never.

52
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,592
Speaker 0: they were always.

53
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,920
Speaker 0: they would always act completely calm.

54
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:51,300
Speaker 0: But they were definitely not calm when they said that because my mom would like follow tornadoes in her car because it was cool.

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,217
Speaker 0: So when mom was like, yeah, the path is perpendicular to your right that's all good.

56
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,874
Speaker 1: But if it's parallel Let's see it.

57
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:06,097
Speaker 0: But in some good news before I get into my actual like super bad news.

58
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:10,750
Speaker 0: Ah Stanley Cup's coming playoff other the playoff.

59
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:14,320
Speaker 1: the people are in the playoffs a whole nother week before you can go on with this news.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,707
Speaker 0: yeah, the playoffs are set for the non wildcard teams and No wildcards are locked in.

61
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:28,579
Speaker 0: so there is like a knife fight and a crab bucket Among the people trying to get the wildcard slot and everyone else is just lynched.

62
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,245
Speaker 0: They're just waiting for the playoffs to start.

63
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:34,580
Speaker 0: like yeah, there's a little bit of seed contention, but it's not that big a deal.

64
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,315
Speaker 0: I guess nobody wants to go against Boston in round one.

65
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:37,979
Speaker 0: But what are you gonna do?

66
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,880
Speaker 1: I still say it's mad that there are 82 hockey games, right?

67
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,120
Speaker 1: Because it's so asymmetrical.

68
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,208
Speaker 1: There should really be I forget.

69
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,793
Speaker 1: I think it's seven when I did the math.

70
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:52,008
Speaker 1: I think it might have been 70 something Basically, there's right now, right?

71
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:56,440
Speaker 1: There are four divisions in two conferences and each of the divisions is eight teams.

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,089
Speaker 1: It's perfectly even eight eight eight eight four thirty-two.

73
00:04:59,109 --> 00:04:59,590
Speaker 0: Thank you.

74
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,614
Speaker 0: recent expansions.

75
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:07,814
Speaker 1: So you want to see Every possible team should come to every possible building one time each right.

76
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,860
Speaker 0: who tops the main bit, right?

77
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:20,440
Speaker 1: So therefore you should play Every team and every other division right which is 24 teams and the three other divisions twice once home once away.

78
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,827
Speaker 1: So 24 times 2 is 48, right.

79
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,580
Speaker 1: and then you want to play the teams that are in your own division.

80
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,660
Speaker 1: Right.

81
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,594
Speaker 1: more than that, right because they're in your division.

82
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:32,760
Speaker 1: You should play them more frequently.

83
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:43,400
Speaker 0: I like is this vision is like a competitive boundary but also because practically if Everybody played everybody equally that is a lot of flying and that is bad for the world and bad for the players, right?

84
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,599
Speaker 1: But you are one of the teams in your division.

85
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,010
Speaker 1: You don't have to play yourself, right?

86
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,994
Speaker 1: So it's not eight.

87
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:51,400
Speaker 1: It's seven, right?

88
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:53,880
Speaker 1: So it's seven other teams in your division.

89
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,407
Speaker 1: You should play them four times each.

90
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,193
Speaker 1: seven times four is 28 28 plus 48.

91
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,841
Speaker 1: Yes 76.

92
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 0: There should be 76 NHL games per season and before you wait, how do they balance it out?

93
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,662
Speaker 0: Well, they kind of just decide like yeah, it's like instead there's 82.

94
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:16,840
Speaker 1: So there's basically just because they want to make more money and sell more tickets to more games that are mostly meaningless.

95
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:23,749
Speaker 1: They tack on six games to every season against who knows what team And it's just like right now.

96
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,469
Speaker 0: I say if they're gonna do that it asymmetrizes Everything.

97
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,198
Speaker 0: they should do that Sort of how the NFL has those games like.

98
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,829
Speaker 0: oh, hey These two teams are just gonna play in London.

99
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,439
Speaker 0: because why not like for this one guy?

100
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,540
Speaker 1: Well, well technically one of those teams is the home team.

101
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:50,940
Speaker 1: But technically but NFL has a symmetrical system where each season you rotate which of the other Divisions you're gonna your division is gonna play against more because obviously you don't play against every team every year.

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:07:01,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, you play against each team in your division, which is only four teams, right twice Home and away and then based on what year it is you cycle through the other.

103
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:06,557
Speaker 1: You know teams that are out there and it's it actually makes perfect sense.

104
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:12,969
Speaker 0: Yep so, uh, yeah the game last night was pretty good and See hockey's coming.

105
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:22,270
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna curse anything, but I'm excited to see at least some number of playoff hockey games where the Rangers are playing.

106
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,425
Speaker 1: in those games you you may see none if they Win enough of them.

107
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:33,290
Speaker 0: so in some bad news and this is news that I don't think a lot of people Realized was happening because one it happened.

108
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:39,940
Speaker 1: It's literally the top news on every news Yeah, but it happened real fast and I didn't know about it till this morning.

109
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:47,006
Speaker 0: It's basically a today only now and while it had been talked about before and this has been talked about in a lot of places But Tennessee is where it's happening first.

110
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,214
Speaker 0: It evolved so quickly.

111
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,639
Speaker 0: This is one of those things that went from.

112
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:56,727
Speaker 0: People who are experts would say things like oh that could happen But it would never really happen.

113
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:03,212
Speaker 0: and then very rapidly went to oh not only can it happen The Republicans just fucking did it like right now live out of nowhere.

114
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:03,332
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,640
Speaker 1: I mean if you know, that's people.

116
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,807
Speaker 1: If it can happen, right?

117
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,131
Speaker 1: It's like it's the same thing.

118
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,077
Speaker 1: people joke about what's that platinum coin.

119
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:12,960
Speaker 1: platinum coin can happen.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, feel like we might need that platinum coin before long and you know what?

121
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,907
Speaker 0: I still think Biden's just fucking do it.

122
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,495
Speaker 0: just print the platinum coin.

123
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:19,836
Speaker 1: Why not?

124
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:20,580
Speaker 1: Why not do it now?

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,901
Speaker 1: What do you?

126
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,107
Speaker 1: why do you got to wait for there to be the?

127
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,574
Speaker 0: I don't think I say.

128
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,484
Speaker 0: just do it because one thing That's what I say.

129
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:26,248
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

130
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:27,856
Speaker 1: Why wait for the crisis moment.

131
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,803
Speaker 1: Just do it get a Problem.

132
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:38,046
Speaker 0: people who pay attention you see like the politician who's on the right side of history or at least the relatively better side Of history makes a big move.

133
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:38,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, fine.

134
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,472
Speaker 0: I'll support it.

135
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:43,269
Speaker 0: and the people who aren't paying that much attention They won't understand or care.

136
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,072
Speaker 0: They won't remember the coin when it comes to the election It's not gonna influence whether or not they vote or not.

137
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,760
Speaker 0: Like it's not gonna have any consequences.

138
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:50,834
Speaker 0: So just do it.

139
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,087
Speaker 0: but so basically what's happening?

140
00:08:53,107 --> 00:09:04,360
Speaker 0: and I'm gonna skip over all the details because this could be hours of talking but I'll link to an article and NPR that explains like the details of how this happened why it happened what the impact is.

141
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:17,245
Speaker 0: but basically Tennessee in America is a state that Likely would be a left-leaning Democratic state but is heavily gerrymandered inside of itself Basically to prevent non-white.

142
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:34,535
Speaker 1: basically, there's Nashville and there's Memphis which are two cities of actually mostly Democratic people not white people, you know that are really cool You know their car places, but other than being car places Those are pretty cool cities and the rest of Tennessee is a not good place.

143
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:38,889
Speaker 1: That is very sparse Let's just say fashy and unpopulated Right.

144
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:48,080
Speaker 0: So the state basically Gerrymandered all the progressive and non-white votes into a small number of districts as happens all over America.

145
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,386
Speaker 0: And it's not.

146
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,320
Speaker 0: this is not a different situation from a lot of these states in America.

147
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:54,827
Speaker 0: So a minority of the population.

148
00:09:54,847 --> 00:10:06,724
Speaker 1: but also it does need to be said right that you know without the gerrymandering The if you just take the total population of Tennessee, right it, you know, these are people that vote, you know Senators are right-wing.

149
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's a total.

150
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,294
Speaker 1: the total voting population is still majority.

151
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:14,424
Speaker 0: not good though, partly because voter suppression Prevents a lot of people.

152
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,487
Speaker 0: That's also.

153
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:20,280
Speaker 0: that's also a fact and voter suppression is controlled by the people we're about to talk about.

154
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:36,239
Speaker 0: So the Republican Party the fashy party has like a mega majority in the state in the Tennessee like State House so They can technically just vote to kick anyone out for any reason just like, you know our house could at the federal level.

155
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:51,299
Speaker 0: So they just decided to kick the three Democrats out that represent these like not super white districts just because they're Democrats and They're just doing it the first one actually breaking right before we started the show.

156
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,649
Speaker 0: The first vote finished and one of them was kicked out.

157
00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:01,615
Speaker 0: They're gonna kick the other two out and this is This is extremely dangerous to American democracy because it is highly likely other.

158
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 1: Well, they get to vote new people in.

159
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,238
Speaker 0: Yep, they could vote the same people in.

160
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:07,319
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

161
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:08,965
Speaker 0: But this is the.

162
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:25,389
Speaker 0: all I'm gonna say is this is the kind of thing that was happening in state Legislatures in the equivalent of purple states in America in the 20 years leading up to the actual Civil War and nothing like this Has happened since the 1800s until just now.

163
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:32,440
Speaker 0: April 6 2023. so I Don't think there'd be a Civil War like Sherman style.

164
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:40,060
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm like that but It could look a lot like what the troubles looked like in Northern Ireland long term if things continue to go down this road.

165
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:43,991
Speaker 0: hmm, so read up on this.

166
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:53,153
Speaker 0: this is a Big crazy history happening and there's a lot to talk about there But we really have time to get into it in geek nights on a Thursday.

167
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:54,780
Speaker 0: Also, I'm hungry and it's nice out.

168
00:11:55,204 --> 00:11:55,953
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

169
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:56,378
Speaker 0: any news?

170
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:05,720
Speaker 1: Well, I don't have a specific single news, I just want to say that in general right now It's like for some reason a mega movie season is happening.

171
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:12,390
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, not just a mega movie season but a weirdly high percentage of these movers or movies I do actually want to see at some point.

172
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,100
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's so we got to go.

173
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,360
Speaker 1: So first of all, I guess we'll talk about it when rim gets a chance to see it.

174
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,180
Speaker 1: But I saw Susan made the new Makoto Shinkai movie which came out actually a little while ago.

175
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,358
Speaker 1: But it's you know, it's gonna be in the US.

176
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:30,069
Speaker 0: Remember this is the one with the chair and if you know if you know what I'm talking about You know what I'm talking about, right?

177
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,075
Speaker 1: So I saw the premiere.

178
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:31,920
Speaker 1: Shinkai was there.

179
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,733
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it on as soon as room sees it on a Wednesday show, right?

180
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can see that soon.

181
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,889
Speaker 1: There's the Mario movie, which I haven't seen.

182
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,394
Speaker 1: I expect it to be bad.

183
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,340
Speaker 1: I've seen some ads for it.

184
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,894
Speaker 1: That's about it.

185
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:51,880
Speaker 1: But everything I've heard and also I assumed before I heard is that it's just gonna be a fan service fiesta.

186
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,410
Speaker 1: So I'm assuming it's to be bad, but I probably see it anyway, all right There's dungeons and dragons movie which we already mentioned.

187
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,840
Speaker 1: a couple people are saying it's good.

188
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,820
Speaker 1: I saw a I guess an added off was a full trailer a partial trailer.

189
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:08,129
Speaker 1: I'm not personally interested but people said it's good.

190
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,484
Speaker 1: So I think if you're the kind of person who actually likes a D&D Oh, I'm gonna go further.

191
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:13,429
Speaker 0: You know what?

192
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:14,614
Speaker 0: I saw the best review.

193
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:17,125
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a newspaper review It was just some nerd on reddit.

194
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:20,760
Speaker 0: They basically said don't the Dungeons and Dragons movie.

195
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:24,720
Speaker 0: Imagine if one of those live streams of D&D was actually good.

196
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, so there's that that's exists.

197
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,607
Speaker 1: at least I'm not gonna see that one spider-verse - ah must watch Just what what?

198
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:33,431
Speaker 1: what did you say?

199
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,074
Speaker 0: I diverse?

200
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:35,621
Speaker 1: - oh, yeah We're gonna.

201
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:38,289
Speaker 1: the spider-man movie has actually come the animated one.

202
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:40,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's coming much sooner than I thought isn't it?

203
00:13:40,575 --> 00:13:42,300
Speaker 0: Like absolute must-watch movie.

204
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,308
Speaker 0: I'm seeing that one in the theater like no question.

205
00:13:44,348 --> 00:13:46,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, we all go in in New York.

206
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,862
Speaker 1: We love spider-man Especially.

207
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:52,155
Speaker 1: and then yeah, I saw John wick for already.

208
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:55,245
Speaker 1: I mean I don't.

209
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,959
Speaker 1: I guess I'm not gonna tell you anything that happens in it.

210
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,278
Speaker 0: I still have it.

211
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:02,898
Speaker 0: We were planning to watch John wick 3 with red and a couple other people so I haven't actually seen 3 yet.

212
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,281
Speaker 1: Well 3 is a lot better and at least in my opinion than 4.

213
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,646
Speaker 0: I mean my order is my favorite.

214
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,540
Speaker 0: John wick is still 1 2 has some great scenes, but I think one is a better movie.

215
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,872
Speaker 1: Well 4 is basically just sort of like.

216
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,880
Speaker 1: first of all, it's really long, right?

217
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,771
Speaker 0: So it's like I like a long wordy lock me in a theater for four hours daddy.

218
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:32,340
Speaker 1: I also like a long movie, but Obviously the majority of it is just fighting with no talking or plot advancement, which is what you would expect from a John wick, right?

219
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:32,641
Speaker 1: It does.

220
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:36,060
Speaker 1: that's what it's on the label is you're gonna see action scenes.

221
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:39,406
Speaker 1: It's like if you cut out the action scenes This movie might be 20 to 30.

222
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:45,739
Speaker 0: John wick is just dynasty warriors with a gun basically basically Yes, the problem is is that?

223
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,550
Speaker 1: Imagine I give you like, you know, I get some Eileen's cheesecake right like the best the best cheesecake, right.

224
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:58,060
Speaker 1: and It's like okay you eat a slice and it's like that was delicious and they eat another slice.

225
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,677
Speaker 1: It's still delicious, but you're full now, right?

226
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:05,340
Speaker 0: Yeah Sometimes sometimes you're like Homer in hell with the donuts and you just keep going.

227
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:11,800
Speaker 1: But it's like John wick for had was just so many minutes of action scenes.

228
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:19,287
Speaker 1: Right that like even though they would mix it up and do different things and there was still you know Something going on there and it wasn't bad.

229
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,853
Speaker 1: I was full.

230
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:24,387
Speaker 1: I was like just Get on with it.

231
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,476
Speaker 1: Just show me the plot already, right?

232
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:31,980
Speaker 1: Not that there was much plot But yeah, you know, it's like whatever.

233
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:36,220
Speaker 1: And there's that one and I feel like there's one more.

234
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,106
Speaker 1: Oh, and there's the the trailer.

235
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:43,021
Speaker 1: during while I was seeing John wick for they showed a trailer for a movie Call.

236
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:49,220
Speaker 1: but from this I guess simple similar studio same studio same, you know, the people that brought you whatever, right?

237
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,396
Speaker 0: Called sisu which is oh, yeah Also known as a Finnish guy murders a lot of bad people.

238
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:56,477
Speaker 0: Yes

239
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:12,794
Speaker 1: It's basically about an old Finnish gold prospector who murders a bunch of Nazis and it's like It's but you could consider it to just be another John wick movie basically, but it's like, you know Hey, you know different character different plot different whatever might you know,

240
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,160
Speaker 0: and then I'm late.

241
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:18,064
Speaker 1: Trailer convinced me that yeah I want to see that right.

242
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:28,780
Speaker 0: one more on the list that I'm actually into even though it's actually from last year and I just Slept on it is if you've seen people talking about the menu, that's my kind of horror comedy movie like straight up.

243
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:30,924
Speaker 1: I never never heard.

244
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:34,575
Speaker 0: Oh, uh, if there's a trailer, but I feel like I don't know.

245
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,180
Speaker 0: the trailer looks spoilery and yeah.

246
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,608
Speaker 0: but well how I was sold on it is.

247
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:49,779
Speaker 0: I just saw our short clip and it was just a scene in the movie and All it is is there's a woman in a fancy restaurant and she orders a cheeseburger From a really intense and creepy chef and I was sold on this movie just from seeing that scene.

248
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:55,955
Speaker 1: Okay People are hype on this new Barbie movie and that seems like something I might watch.

249
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,180
Speaker 1: if it I wouldn't go to the theater.

250
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,790
Speaker 0: I might go to the theater to see Barbie.

251
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,977
Speaker 1: I don't need to.

252
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:02,462
Speaker 1: and then I've been seeing.

253
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,909
Speaker 1: you know, obviously I don't go see any superhero movies.

254
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,900
Speaker 1: I haven't seen a live-action superhero movie in the theater.

255
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,640

261
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,356
Speaker 1: Read like all the DC comic books.

262
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:43,100

267
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,956

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,871

287
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,839
Speaker 0: I kind of wait to see if people talk about him after they come out.

288
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:38,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway Book times movie season for some reason.

289
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,803
Speaker 0: But anyway things Of the day.

290
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:47,433
Speaker 0: so Emily I watched this the other night and it is up your alley Scott.

291
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,840
Speaker 0: This is a New Yorker cartoon.

292
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:53,254
Speaker 0: They have some originals and it's on this YouTube channel.

293
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:53,636
Speaker 0: It's linked to.

294
00:19:53,656 --> 00:19:55,902
Speaker 0: it is 10 minutes long Neighborhood.

295
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:02,800
Speaker 0: nostalgia comes to life and all I'm gonna say is this is basically you want to see some s-tier old New York guys?

296
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:11,714
Speaker 0: Talking about New York this this short is s-tier old, New York guys This is just a really good day.

297
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:12,640
Speaker 0: This is delightful.

298
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:20,348
Speaker 0: It is definitely worth watching and it is both nostalgic to what New York was like but also Real about like.

299
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:22,940
Speaker 0: not everything was great in that era of New York.

300
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,221
Speaker 0: Like.

301
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:28,319
Speaker 0: we can't pretend that New York was perfect in the olden times and is terrible.

302
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,616
Speaker 0: now There's like one of the guys went to prison for a couple of dimes after he got involved with the mob.

303
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:37,688
Speaker 1: So Yeah So yeah my thing of the day.

304
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:56,195
Speaker 1: if you watch the news in the u.s Right every time someone brings up the idea of taxing the rich right not on the federal level in the u.s But you know in the local levels then everyone's like, ah, if you tax the rich They'll leave and then you'll actually lose tote tax revenue because you'll be.

305
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:56,718
Speaker 1: you'll have.

306
00:20:56,818 --> 00:21:03,444
Speaker 1: you know All those people who are in that higher tax bracket that you that you created won't even live here anymore Right now.

307
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:07,020
Speaker 1: they're at least paying a little bit if they're paying, you know this tax right now.

308
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:17,879
Speaker 0: My old argument used to be face value before we get into your thing of the day was you know what good if they leave Rents come down because while we're getting less tax revenue also all their rich person bullshit goes away with them.

309
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:24,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, the point is is that studies show that actually no they won't leave right there.

310
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,380
Speaker 1: Basically, almost you would take you would have to set taxes to like 60 like I think they had a number in this video.

311
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,660
Speaker 1: I forget what the number was but like a very high percentage before it's gets to the point where you're.

312
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,744
Speaker 0: If you don't live in New York Exactly, but you know, it's.

313
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,030
Speaker 1: it's not just true for New York.

314
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,560
Speaker 1: It's true for most places like that place where the person lives.

315
00:21:44,941 --> 00:21:45,905
Speaker 1: They've set down roots.

316
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,290
Speaker 1: That's where the people they know are.

317
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,474
Speaker 1: that's where their business is.

318
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,100
Speaker 1: It's like moving isn't easy.

319
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,060
Speaker 1: It's actually harder to move when you're rich because you've got so much shit, right?

320
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,040
Speaker 1: It's like if you're you know poor and you don't have a lot of stuff moving is can you know?

321
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,826
Speaker 1: Expensive moving is difficult.

322
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,880
Speaker 0: The most expensive moving is lower middle-class American family, right?

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Speaker 1: But the roots that you have set down are not as much right?

324
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,062
Speaker 1: It's like if I had less stuff I could just pick up all my stuff and get in a van and also think a rich Person.

325
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:17,903
Speaker 0: they're living exactly where they want to be living because money is no barrier to that Yep.

326
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:35,706
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this person did sort of like this video Which is sort of like it reads sort of like a Daily Show segment or you know, whatever Where they go around and they're like, you know calling rich people are ringing on their doorbells and being like hey You know taxes are going up.

327
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:38,840
Speaker 1: We're gonna we'll help you move and they're not interested, right?

328
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,962
Speaker 1: It's a whole.

329
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:49,540
Speaker 1: it's a whole bit about basically to drive home the point that like no they won't leave Tax them more right but it's in a in a comedic and funny in a funny way.

330
00:22:50,161 --> 00:23:04,540
Speaker 0: So yeah in the meta moment the geek nights book club book Which we're gonna try to target to do the show around the end of April the satanic verses by Sam and Rushdee Behind my the number of pages I need to read in order to.

331
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:10,291
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had to partly because it got real nice out When I would have been reading I went.

332
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:17,138
Speaker 1: the problem is is that you know I'm reading the book and then I fall asleep not because I'm bored with the book, but because I'm tired.

333
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:18,808
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, we are.

334
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:19,351
Speaker 0: we're in our 40s.

335
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:20,480
Speaker 0: So give us a give some slack.

336
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:28,675
Speaker 1: It's like I lay on the couch and then I wake up with this You know my hand in the book and say well But if nothing else so many people have tried to murder this man because of this book.

337
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:39,540
Speaker 0: and if you read this book based on What I've read so far it is Really kind of insane to imagine that someone would want to murder this man over this specific book.

338
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,812
Speaker 0: Otherwise no cons for a while.

339
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,866
Speaker 0: Uh We'll see what happens.

340
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:48,020
Speaker 0: Hopefully we'll see you at PAX West and packs unplugged.

341
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:49,925
Speaker 0: It's gonna be summer.

342
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,860
Speaker 0: hopefully we'll do some interesting side content.

343
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:59,252
Speaker 0: Maybe do some live streams or some geek nights episodes outside all the stuff We were really trying to do right before a kovat hit.

344
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:03,857
Speaker 0: and then old technology We tried wasn't great, but I think now we have a really good setup.

345
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:04,380
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

346
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, the website is coming along.

347
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:08,713
Speaker 0: I got some videos.

348
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:11,606
Speaker 0: all the video got Scott got from the panel We did at PAX East.

349
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,375
Speaker 0: I think I can put something together with that.

350
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,082
Speaker 0: So gonna work on that ID.

351
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:20,180
Speaker 0: I need some bad weather now, I need like weather that keeps me inside long enough to edit that video together.

352
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:30,628
Speaker 0: So hope for some storms over here And I think we get right into it cuz I was in a hockey game last night and a fixture in my life because I was not.

353
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:36,104
Speaker 0: grew up in Detroit moved to Rochester now, I live in New York City and Go to a lot of sports.

354
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:39,695
Speaker 0: Like I enjoy watching people compete in a variety of sports.

355
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:43,968
Speaker 0: I went to monster truck shows Which there are some sports and competitions there.

356
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:47,960
Speaker 0: It's not just rolling it like the it's not just rolling over cars for fun.

357
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,591
Speaker 0: They also ostensibly have some amount of competition.

358
00:24:50,611 --> 00:25:09,122
Speaker 0: a lot of hockey a lot of basketball various levels of hockey and basketball including extremely amateur levels and anyone who goes to a lot of sports has a lot of opinions on the different arenas and venues and places that sports happen and a Sports.

359
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:12,836
Speaker 1: but other large entertainment events, you know the big concerts.

360
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly big concerts.

361
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840
Speaker 0: Let's leave convention centers out of this though because that gets a little we're talking about.

362
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:27,848
Speaker 1: you know an arena or you know a a stadium or a colosseum or you know a place where there is a Central area of attention.

363
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:31,200
Speaker 1: Yeah and a large number of seats in one room.

364
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:42,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, right like, you know a circus circuses, you know A Place where there's only one thing going on and everyone is there to see that one thing.

365
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:53,808
Speaker 1: but a circus has three rings right, but not we're gonna not include things like, you know an opera house or a Hall right where it's like you're.

366
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,539
Speaker 1: it's really only for one thing like, you know, you go it's.

367
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,679
Speaker 1: you know It's it's a it's a multi-purpose sort of arena, right?

368
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,107
Speaker 0: But also that's when they're big enough.

369
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:08,480
Speaker 1: basically, you know modern equivalents of the Colosseum in Rome were there.

370
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,771
Speaker 1: I don't know historically were there colosseums before the Colosseum or was that the first one?

371
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:17,363
Speaker 0: there were arenas all over Lots.

372
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:18,369
Speaker 1: they weren't like that one.

373
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,335
Speaker 1: Well, there was.

374
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:20,200
Speaker 1: that was like the biggest.

375
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:22,060
Speaker 0: There are proto versions like that.

376
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,620
Speaker 0: But yeah, that was basically like the one the government was like, alright This is we're gonna make the big one because we don't want anyone to riot in the city.

377
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,560
Speaker 1: There weren't bigger ones that just no don't look exist any longer.

378
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:38,640
Speaker 0: Uh, not that I know of and I'm qualifying there just because I'm not a hundred percent sure.

379
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:45,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then as time went on I guess, you know, the any of the modern ones are basically children of that one.

380
00:26:45,741 --> 00:26:45,861
Speaker 1: I've

381
00:26:45,881 --> 00:27:01,658
Speaker 0: never been to that one, but I have been to the chariot arena in the in Constantinople the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire Which is huge and has the serpent column in it and there's there's cool stuff there And actually the track is like still there like the course that they ran.

382
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:02,180
Speaker 0: it's pretty cool.

383
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:20,038
Speaker 0: but the other thing about these big arenas and venues and like colosseums is that Because of their scale and because they are designed fundamentally to host the maximum number of people Like you think of these as an unlimited number of people effectively would go to this thing if they could.

384
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:20,760
Speaker 0: how do we get as?

385
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,227
Speaker 0: Many people into this thing.

386
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:23,635
Speaker 0: They're all bespoke.

387
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:24,580
Speaker 0: They're all unique.

388
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:34,557
Speaker 0: They're not just cookie cutter like the jolos arena that I watched the Red Wings in as a kid is So different from Madison Square Garden that they are like different kinds of buildings.

389
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,823
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean that's.

390
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:36,707
Speaker 1: I think that's the thing.

391
00:27:36,747 --> 00:27:39,139
Speaker 1: is it every time someone makes one of these right?

392
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:46,936
Speaker 1: They really you know There are a lot of things in common between them now But no one ever really makes the same one twice because you've got a different place.

393
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:47,760
Speaker 1: You're putting it in.

394
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've got a different, you know Kind of culture.

395
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:54,200
Speaker 1: you have a different kinds of events that are going to be held there.

396
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:58,640
Speaker 0: Are you a city that can have a place that only does hockey or do you need that place to also do?

397
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,460
Speaker 0: Basketball because hockey is not that big.

398
00:28:01,122 --> 00:28:06,000
Speaker 1: You've got different, you know laws and regulations in the place where you're building this thing, right?

399
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:24,056
Speaker 1: You have different interests, you know, and there's just so many hands and any time one of these things is made Right so that they're all unique and interesting but also in their own ology and best practices change Way faster than they can should and do.

400
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:24,780
Speaker 0: build these things.

401
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,619
Speaker 0: So every one that gets built is already the state of the art unless it's in a city that fucks it up.

402
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:34,614
Speaker 0: so like I like I have a lot of nostalgia for the Joe Louis Arena.

403
00:28:34,935 --> 00:28:42,139
Speaker 0: the new arena they play in is Objectively just better in every depends in which you know what you're counting as better, right?

404
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:55,859
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean sometimes they fuck up and make it worse But like I could it is how it was hard in say the 1940s to put as many seats in say a hockey arena as we can do with modern technology.

405
00:28:55,939 --> 00:29:07,306
Speaker 0: today in 2023 like like look at Madison Square Garden, which is already pretty old They got this whole like third level that is just hanging from the inside of the facility You couldn't add 40s.

406
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,670
Speaker 1: Well, they added that on.

407
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,753
Speaker 1: Yeah wasn't there?

408
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:12,463
Speaker 0: that couldn't have been built in 1940.

409
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:18,850
Speaker 1: No, it was a renovation it wasn't you know a built thing, yeah But you know, it's like some places you like you're.

410
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,833
Speaker 1: yet you're in the United States, you know in Boston You get your Fenway Park right.

411
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:29,100
Speaker 1: in Chicago You got your Wrigley Field like super old baseball stadiums, right and those super old baseball stadiums.

412
00:29:29,503 --> 00:29:37,117
Speaker 1: They sort of because they're so old Right, they sort of have a character in a history because they managed to not destroy them like everyone else.

413
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:37,939
Speaker 1: did you know who?

414
00:29:38,384 --> 00:29:42,320
Speaker 1: Upgraded You know, so they managed to hold on to those for so long.

415
00:29:42,480 --> 00:30:00,639
Speaker 1: It's like well now you're stuck with them and they have deficiencies, right and they lack some modern accoutrement that you can't really fix because they're just too small or they're too old, right you can only do so much You know, you don't want to ruin it and but they can renovate to some extent, right?

416
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:07,648
Speaker 1: But it's like yeah, and the problem is you get things like well Fenway Park, you know Some of the seats aren't good.

417
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:10,907
Speaker 1: You could be sitting behind a post or You could.

418
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:14,485
Speaker 0: there there are Islanders where they used to play like.

419
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,310
Speaker 0: there are literally just huge sections.

420
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,835
Speaker 0: You can't see anything right?

421
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:21,086
Speaker 1: They're like, you know, they'll be Not enough seats.

422
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:24,420
Speaker 1: and it's like yeah, we have a huge event here, but we don't have enough tickets.

423
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:26,960
Speaker 1: So the price is on the tickets.

424
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
Speaker 1: We do have a fortune.

425
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,746
Speaker 1: Where's some other bigger stadium?

426
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:34,200
Speaker 1: the ticket prices can at least get down a bit because there's a little more supply going on.

427
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:36,460
Speaker 1: More of the seats can see better.

428
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:40,512
Speaker 1: You know, you have weird things like I guess again Fenway Park.

429
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,840
Speaker 1: They have the big green monster in left field, right?

430
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,116
Speaker 1: It's like no one would make a baseball stadium like that today.

431
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:48,130
Speaker 1: now It's sort of a character thing, right?

432
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,580
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's also makes the game a bit.

433
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:52,964
Speaker 0: The red wings.

434
00:30:53,004 --> 00:31:01,008
Speaker 0: before the Joe they used to play in the the Olympia and I remember my family would always talk about like going Redwings games in that old facility.

435
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:13,119
Speaker 0: the state the stairs and the seats were so steep that according to family legend Many people would fall and seriously injure themselves every single game trying to get into and out of their seats.

436
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,538
Speaker 0: drunk Yep.

437
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:21,496
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like I've been going to stadiums sir, you know, I guess since I knew what the hell was going on.

438
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:25,240
Speaker 1: Yeah Some of them don't exist anymore.

439
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:25,779
Speaker 0: Yeah.

440
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:32,707
Speaker 0: And also there's the trend that a lot of the places I went as a kid were named after famous people Named after places like.

441
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:35,200
Speaker 0: they had just local character color names.

442
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:43,820
Speaker 0: but most of the places now like the Red Wings played in the Olympia and then they played in a Joe Louis arena and now they play in the Little Caesars arena.

443
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:45,585
Speaker 1: Well, hold on now, right?

444
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:47,792
Speaker 1: So the the thing there it's not.

445
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,618
Speaker 1: people think that that's like a change.

446
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,670
Speaker 1: that's happened Right, it's.

447
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,100
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a change at all.

448
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,094
Speaker 0: You know the ones that didn't have these commercialized names were the rare ones for a long time.

449
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,780
Speaker 1: No, no, no, that's not at all.

450
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,187
Speaker 1: They've always had a commercialized name, right?

451
00:32:01,508 --> 00:32:06,304
Speaker 1: It wasn't named Shea Stadium because they wanted to honor Mr.

452
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:06,808
Speaker 1: Right.

453
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:08,380
Speaker 1: It's cuz there was a rich guy named Shea.

454
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:13,420
Speaker 1: That's why it's just the rich people used to put their own fucking name on the stuff Carnegie Hall or whatever.

455
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there are no rich people would to put their names on it.

456
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:22,171
Speaker 1: the rich company It's just whoever was rich at the time put their name on the thing that Detroit set.

457
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,756
Speaker 0: We just named it after Joe Louis.

458
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,880
Speaker 1: I Guess so, but the exceptions Joe Louis, I guess once he was success and the Olympia was just called Olympia Stadium, right?

459
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,233
Speaker 1: Well, the the exceptions for example would be like in New York.

460
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,340
Speaker 1: There was the Polo Grounds.

461
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

462
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,609
Speaker 1: That was it was literally named.

463
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,296
Speaker 1: It was the place where they played polo.

464
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:43,120
Speaker 1: It's like it did.

465
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,490
Speaker 1: They didn't have a name for it.

466
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:45,720
Speaker 1: It was just the polo ground.

467
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:50,940
Speaker 1: And then the other exceptions would be things like Yankee Stadium giant stadium.

468
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:53,953
Speaker 1: It's named after what goes on there primarily, right?

469
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:55,439
Speaker 0: I do like that style a little bit.

470
00:32:56,162 --> 00:33:00,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, you could just call it med stadium, but they they never did that, right?

471
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,526
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah now, you know, it's like.

472
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:11,299
Speaker 1: but I can agree that you know a name of a person Even though even if it was originally just a rich person slapping their own name on there, right?

473
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:13,966
Speaker 0: Over time it's forgotten.

474
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:19,440
Speaker 1: people don't know who the person was or what it means or anything unless they look it up on Wikipedia, right?

475
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,479
Speaker 1: and so what ends up happening is that just ends up being a word that has no meaning.

476
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:31,700
Speaker 1: and Because it has no meaning it doesn't feel commercialized in any way shape or form especially that person's dead, right?

477
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:39,142
Speaker 1: Whereas a brand, you know the Citi Field or the MetLife Stadium here America Park Fucking.

478
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:46,443
Speaker 1: but they in LA they had the Staples Center which used to be something else and that was the crypto calm arena Which is the worst ever.

479
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,831
Speaker 0: that is actually the worst one on earth.

480
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:50,415
Speaker 1: That's the worst one, right?

481
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:57,097
Speaker 1: Because it has a Name that is a brand that you actually associate with something.

482
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:06,316
Speaker 1: now You have the sort of double association where it's like you're got a cup a brand Right and this building and that's what that's their intent.

483
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:16,000
Speaker 0: Obviously, that's work except it's Like if there was a comp USA or you know, that would just be really funny and they kept it that way forever.

484
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:25,306
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I like the ones personally where like you said Joe Louis arena where it's named after someone not because of money But because of worth right.

485
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:28,460
Speaker 1: the tennis over here is Arthur Ashe Stadium, right?

486
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,949
Speaker 1: Over in Australia, right?

487
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,219
Speaker 1: It's a rod lever state, right?

488
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,335
Speaker 1: It's like they named after someone who was fucking great at tennis.

489
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:38,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

490
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,023
Speaker 1: It's like.

491
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:43,275
Speaker 1: it's not named after the rich person or the company or what happened.

492
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:48,956
Speaker 1: It's not just called tennis arena As a name with a. it's like that.

493
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:54,237
Speaker 1: that's good Like if you had a hockey arena and you just called it Wayne Gretzky arena, right?

494
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:55,040
Speaker 1: That's what it's like.

495
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,984
Speaker 1: It's like that would be good.

496
00:34:56,406 --> 00:35:08,027
Speaker 0: But in our in New York, you know Madison Square Garden That is it is its own company and venue and like media empire by itself Mmm owned by a piece of shit guy.

497
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:09,775
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that guy sucks like full disclosure.

498
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:10,377
Speaker 0: Fuck him.

499
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:19,439
Speaker 0: and also One thing I can say about MSG because every read is different and I got a lot of anecdotes about arenas I've been to with pros and cons and such.

500
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,080
Speaker 0: MSG is The hardest arena to get out of I have ever been to in my life.

501
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,819
Speaker 0: It takes it takes a while to get out of that place.

502
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:32,829
Speaker 1: It's pretty similar to a giant stadium.

503
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:36,300
Speaker 1: was in giant when you went to giant stadium with the one that doesn't exist anymore.

504
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:41,959
Speaker 1: basically, there were these spiral ramps on the corners right and they weren't stairs they were ramps.

505
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:46,351
Speaker 1: and Basically, it's like after the game you would exit.

506
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:49,260
Speaker 1: you just get what you had to get to one of the corners of giant stadium.

507
00:35:49,382 --> 00:36:00,071
Speaker 1: I think there might have been some in the middle but you had to get to one of these ramps and Basically, you'd have to walk all the way down unless you were sitting way low I guess but you walked all the way down this big spiral.

508
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:05,953
Speaker 1: It took a long time And eventually you got to the bottom right.

509
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:14,720
Speaker 0: all the listener points out What about the NCAA and college arenas that often have like Michigan State like they're often just called like Spartan Stadium or something.

510
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,223
Speaker 0: I like that.

511
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:15,786
Speaker 0: That's true.

512
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:16,289
Speaker 1: That's true.

513
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,799
Speaker 1: But the other thing about the center.

514
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:23,274
Speaker 1: Well, at least the United States the college football stadiums are actually the biggest ones.

515
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,400
Speaker 1: they have the big capacity, right?

516
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,979
Speaker 1: It's like Madison Square Garden conceit, you know for hockey.

517
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:32,530
Speaker 1: It's 18,006 seats total for for basketball.

518
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,080
Speaker 1: It's a little bit more right the the college football stadiums.

519
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:41,399
Speaker 1: Some of them are like a hundred thousand plus like five Madison Square Gardens worth of people and they fill them up.

520
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:49,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Giants the Giants play in an arena that holds 80,000 people right now according to my life stadium.

521
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:51,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, New York Giants football giant.

522
00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:58,540
Speaker 0: Yes the Place that Michigan State football plays seats almost the same number of people.

523
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:02,170
Speaker 0: Yep, and other ones are way bigger than that.

524
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:03,878
Speaker 0: Michigan State is not the biggest or the best.

525
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:06,836
Speaker 0: Sorry drew My brother went to MSU, but most of my friends went to U of M.

526
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,665
Speaker 1: So Yeah, you know the.

527
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,132
Speaker 1: I think I really good.

528
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:20,780
Speaker 1: if you want to talk about college places Right a place that I'm familiar with because it was in Connecticut where I lived for 16 17 years right is the Yale Bowl, right?

529
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,862
Speaker 1: So it's like.

530
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:26,439
Speaker 1: basically that's like the ancestor of all the college stadiums in the u.s.

531
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:28,313
Speaker 1: Effectively like it's still there.

532
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:32,710
Speaker 1: They still use it But like it's basically like the old.

533
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,178
Speaker 1: you want to see what it's like old and busted right?

534
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:37,609
Speaker 1: It's like it's just like these.

535
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,000
Speaker 1: I Mean.

536
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:42,880
Speaker 1: if you look at a picture of it, you'll see it's literally just like a bowl, right?

537
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:43,878
Speaker 1: It's not like.

538
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,399
Speaker 1: You know an arena that's built up.

539
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:52,537
Speaker 1: It's like it's like cut out of the ground almost like this little dish and it's not very deep whatsoever.

540
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:54,622
Speaker 1: It's just wide Right.

541
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:59,620
Speaker 0: Oh, so I looked up because you know RIT, you know the hockey we talked about a lot and old gig nights.

542
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,504
Speaker 0: We we used to go see at the Ritter Which was free.

543
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:03,107
Speaker 1: they have a new one.

544
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:04,514
Speaker 1: They built a new one right after we left.

545
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:08,206
Speaker 0: So the Ritter's seated 2100 people 1600 sitting 500 standing.

546
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:09,953
Speaker 0: I went to many a game where I stood.

547
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:19,480
Speaker 0: I Have a lot of fond memories that place the gene Pulisani Center the one that they built right as we were leaving named after a rich guy who paid for it.

548
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,714
Speaker 0: Yep seats more than double that.

549
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:25,811
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, one consider much nicer.

550
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,420
Speaker 0: another consideration on the seating.

551
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,871
Speaker 0: That's interesting is that part of the reason why NCAA venues are just so big it's partly that They're gonna be filled.

552
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:34,800
Speaker 0: because of school spirit.

553
00:38:35,181 --> 00:38:43,960
Speaker 0: They're often actually cheaper to go to or at least the tickets are sold cheaper and are often allocated to students Forget there is a secondary market and scalping and stuff up and all that stuff.

554
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,197
Speaker 0: but like tickets are generally directly cheaper because they just want to fill it.

555
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,708
Speaker 0: but like You don't build a hockey arena.

556
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:54,619
Speaker 0: That's not gonna mostly sell out on purpose.

557
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:05,527
Speaker 0: There are a lot of cities that build smaller arenas on purpose to make sure they sell out rather than having empty capacity For a lot of historical and capitalist reasons.

558
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,610
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

559
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:10,040
Speaker 1: All right, so let's let's go through some arena related topics, right?

560
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,671
Speaker 1: So the first of all talk about some dome action, right?

561
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:14,840
Speaker 1: So some of them got roofs and some of them don't got roofs.

562
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

563
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:18,271
Speaker 1: and in my opinion, right?

564
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:21,020
Speaker 1: It's like I think some of the roofs, right?

565
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,962
Speaker 1: I mean having a roof is kind of good because you can play when there's bad weather but for game for certain sports Right.

566
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:31,540
Speaker 1: bad weather is charming like a man football who doesn't love a football in the snow?

567
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:37,659
Speaker 0: I have a lot of issues with American football But something I deeply respect about it is that the rules are basically they play no matter what?

568
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,405
Speaker 1: Almost no matter.

569
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:46,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if there's a tornado like barreling toward the arena It's a lot more tolerant than other sports to bad weather like football in the snow.

570
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,859
Speaker 0: that I got kind of like watching.

571
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:53,435
Speaker 1: actually Right, but if you have a dome you lose that charm right to.

572
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:54,660
Speaker 1: some of the domes can be ugly.

573
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, old old domes like a lot of the older shittier ones stopped working properly and stuff, right?

574
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,123
Speaker 1: That's that's not.

575
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:10,614
Speaker 1: there's a few big ones that have been stuck for a long time Yeah, but it's also kind of nice right like for baseball Let's say where they will just at the one drop of rain.

576
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:13,528
Speaker 1: They stopped playing baseball Almost right where it's like.

577
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,433
Speaker 1: you bought tickets.

578
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,439
Speaker 1: you want to go to the game?

579
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:20,540
Speaker 1: If they have the dome or roof, it's like great, you know, I've been to games so there's been a rain delay.

580
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,920
Speaker 1: We'd sit around waiting for hours or you have to leave and come back another day.

581
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's just nice to be able to ensure that you buy a ticket.

582
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:31,012
Speaker 1: you're gonna go and at that time You know, the game will happen.

583
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:37,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, right There's good ice hockey where you're really got to play indoors and climate change is only gonna make that worse.

584
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:44,140
Speaker 0: But occasionally you get like the winter classic like the special game that's in a like bespoke or one-time use.

585
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:48,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, my knowledge whether hasn't spoiled any winter classics yet.

586
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:52,500
Speaker 0: Yeah I feel like that'll come someday unless they just move them further and further north.

587
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:53,744
Speaker 1: It would be awesome if it.

588
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:57,859
Speaker 1: you know, there might have been one word wet bad weather, but I just didn't know about it.

589
00:40:58,322 --> 00:40:59,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd like that.

590
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:01,099
Speaker 0: I feel like it snowed a little bit during one of them.

591
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,951
Speaker 0: Maybe I vaguely recall that but it wasn't enough to affect the game.

592
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:05,875
Speaker 0: I wish it had.

593
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:06,838
Speaker 0: I just like that.

594
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,743
Speaker 0: but There's the.

595
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:10,149
Speaker 0: how do you get to it and leave it?

596
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:11,214
Speaker 0: Cuz one big thing.

597
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:23,080
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah arenas in big if all of cities that are dense and have mass transit are Fundamentally different in a lot of ways from a suburban stadium out in the middle of nowhere.

598
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:37,900
Speaker 1: Yep, so for just to give you an example or a most when you have a stadium that is not in a downtown of a city It's usually surrounded by parking lots that are empty most of the time and it's not great.

599
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:38,940
Speaker 0: I think it sucks.

600
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:51,160
Speaker 0: I think that actually mutes a lot of the benefits in arena could bring to a community because it is just this capitalist event outside of any community Fully surrounded by horrible parking lots and cars and nightmare traffic.

601
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:55,759
Speaker 0: It makes the lives of everyone who live near it miserable and it doesn't benefit them in any way.

602
00:41:56,562 --> 00:42:05,101
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's like even look at you know over City Field over there and Shea Stadium before it you know with all those parking lots and it's like That's.

603
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,135
Speaker 1: you know, if there were houses on that land, you know, how many people you could house?

604
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about Valuable.

605
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:15,315
Speaker 1: that land is in housing there and raise the price of the houses.

606
00:42:15,355 --> 00:42:16,640
Speaker 1: the seven train goes there.

607
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:17,399
Speaker 0: How about this?

608
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,282
Speaker 0: He's all houses there.

609
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:18,503
Speaker 0: right.

610
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:24,020
Speaker 0: every house gets four season tickets so they can lease them out or do whatever they want with them.

611
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:31,160
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's like it's a. it's a real shame to not to just have that land be used on Parking but also flat parking lot.

612
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,335
Speaker 1: It's not even a parking garage.

613
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:36,458
Speaker 0: This leads to a much bigger externality that if you don't live in America, you might not realize.

614
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:40,720
Speaker 0: so Drunk driving in America is actually one of the biggest killers of humans.

615
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:42,911
Speaker 0: Like it is it is like up there.

616
00:42:42,931 --> 00:42:48,040
Speaker 1: it is guns, right right now It's pretty much guns and cars are the two things that kill Americans the most.

617
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:56,383
Speaker 0: yep, but drunk driving is a huge problem in America and a Scary percentage of it is caused directly by the arenas We just described.

618
00:42:56,644 --> 00:43:01,340
Speaker 0: because people there's no way to get to most sports venues in America except by driving there.

619
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:06,528
Speaker 0: a lot of people like to drink alcohol while they're watching sports and Then they stop selling it to you.

620
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,780
Speaker 1: after a certain point people will hold on to it.

621
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the buy a whole bunch at the second intermission and then drink.

622
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:20,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not allowed to buy beer in like the last quarter of a football game But I can buy as much beer as I want two seconds before that quarter starts.

623
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:21,480
Speaker 0: like that doesn't make sense.

624
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,126
Speaker 1: It makes sense for the people who are making money.

625
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:27,759
Speaker 0: so does but even then, you know, I've had alcohol.

626
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:32,160
Speaker 0: One quarter of a football game is not enough time for all the beers.

627
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,573
Speaker 0: You're not even close to get back down to a blood alcohol.

628
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,920
Speaker 0: That is legal or reasonable?

629
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:41,996
Speaker 1: I wonder if we could do a study like comparing a number of DUIs after games with ot versus without ot.

630
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:49,980
Speaker 0: Oh, I Remember being stuck at that crazy like many ot game at MSG and of course, you know all the employees like they stopped serving food.

631
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,767
Speaker 0: I was desperately hungry.

632
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,112
Speaker 0: Everything was shut down.

633
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,276
Speaker 0: There's nothing to eat.

634
00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:01,300
Speaker 1: Yep So just you know some interesting getting to and from stories right obviously mad square garden.

635
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:04,730
Speaker 1: It's like I guess you could drive to it and park in a parking garage.

636
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:06,576
Speaker 0: a lot of people scarily do.

637
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:17,314
Speaker 1: it's a bad idea mostly Jersey people right, but I Once drove to Fenway Park for the all-star game, right and the parking garage.

638
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:20,723
Speaker 1: This is a 19 maybe early 2000 I forget late 90s.

639
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:25,481
Speaker 1: You can look it up because that the all-star game hasn't been there that often right and The.

640
00:44:25,682 --> 00:44:31,440
Speaker 1: I remember distinctly in that this is at least 20 years ago the parking garages that were right next to Fenway.

641
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,504
Speaker 1: We didn't park at those ones.

642
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,789
Speaker 1: We parked further away, right?

643
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,375
Speaker 0: Same large earnings games.

644
00:44:35,957 --> 00:44:44,536
Speaker 1: They were charging Like city bucks in the nose that was a hundred.

645
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,460
Speaker 1: this is an all-star game.

646
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, this wasn't a normal game.

647
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,913
Speaker 1: But even you know Boston parking is already out of control, right?

648
00:44:50,194 --> 00:45:00,940
Speaker 0: It's probably $150 normally Those arenas I think 50 bucks just to park it packs not counting the valet charge for one by MetLife MetLife Stadium.

649
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:13,710
Speaker 1: Right these state it's like, you know, even if even though they're surrounded by parking lots They still don't have enough parking and you have to buy a separate parking pass permit Right to park your car at the stadium.

650
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,220
Speaker 1: Otherwise you to park at some other lot somewhere.

651
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I take like a bus or walk like 20 minutes if

652
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:35,340
Speaker 1: you want to go see football New England Patriots football in Foxborough, Massachusetts Right, basically you get off the highway at this exit and there's this road and on the road It's basically nothing but like motels and stuff and people selling like parking spots on their grass.

653
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:40,204
Speaker 1: Right and as you get closer to the stadium the prices go up Right.

654
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:45,318
Speaker 1: and then eventually when you get all the way to the stadium, it's like well if you want to park at the stadium I hope you have a parking pass.

655
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

656
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:50,373
Speaker 1: and so basically there's this whole culture of you drive and this one road.

657
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:52,860
Speaker 1: everyone parks somewhere on that road, right?

658
00:45:53,220 --> 00:46:05,192
Speaker 1: However much they're willing to walk before and after the game or whether they have a pass or not And the road is one way before the game starts and then sometime during the game They switch the road to be one way backwards.

659
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:15,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Don't know if they might keep one lane separately or something for you know But it's uh, it's like this weird at this whole weird setup for going to and from this thing.

660
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,890
Speaker 1: This is in the middle of nowhere by itself Right, just just for events.

661
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:25,989
Speaker 0: so that I remember as kids cuz you know We go to Red Wings games when we could like we weren't rich But we got to go to Red Wings games and when we go we drive.

662
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:31,573
Speaker 0: cuz while there was the mass transit within and around Detroit there's no way to get to go to where your house was.

663
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:32,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we

664
00:46:32,416 --> 00:47:01,063
Speaker 0: drive and the rule was We would either walk out in the last four minutes of the game to get to our contract to GTFO or We would just stay in our seats for like 40 minutes before even considered leaving Because if you left when the game ended you would sit in your car Slowly moving through the parking garage for and I'm this is zero exaggeration over an hour like minimum It was.

665
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,533
Speaker 0: it took so long to get out of that parking garage.

666
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:06,329
Speaker 0: it was just a nightmare You know, that's the thing.

667
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:20,043
Speaker 1: if you'd bring your car to the stadium We basically a game had to be like ridiculously close exciting for us to actually stay Right to the complete end if we card to the game because we had to get to the car early to get the hell out Of there, right?

668
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:23,739
Speaker 1: I remember distinctly one time where we went to.

669
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:36,013
Speaker 1: It was Patriot Saints in Foxborough, right and there was like almost no time left on the clock whatsoever, right and They the Saints were up and the Saints got an interception.

670
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, as soon as they caught that interception We're like it's over.

671
00:47:38,945 --> 00:47:39,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we get.

672
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,400
Speaker 1: we just got up and left because there were not not much time left.

673
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,644
Speaker 1: Right and we go or get to the car we get in the car Right and we eat.

674
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:53,751
Speaker 1: whether eat whether you left a game early or not, right or you would customarily turn the radio on to the game Right.

675
00:47:53,995 --> 00:48:03,000
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I have a lot of memories of sitting in that traffic in the parking garage Listening to the last few minutes of the game on the radio Right or sometimes it would just be the post game if you actually did stay to the end.

676
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:17,382
Speaker 1: But we're in the car and then we hear people outside the car freaking out Right and then after some short delay the radio is freaking out and it's like well, I guess you shouldn't have left that game Right.

677
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:21,399
Speaker 1: Tom Brady found a way with the the remaining time on the clock.

678
00:48:21,439 --> 00:48:23,739
Speaker 1: somehow I'm sure someone can look up and see what game that was.

679
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:26,953
Speaker 1: But it's like if we didn't have to car that wouldn't happen.

680
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:28,460
Speaker 1: We would have seen the whole game even at MSG.

681
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,390
Speaker 0: So we Emily and I were at that crazy many overtimes game.

682
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:40,260
Speaker 0: a lot of people left after the first OT Because they had to catch their train back to New Jersey like or they don't have a good way to get home.

683
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,343
Speaker 0: So they had to leave.

684
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:49,115
Speaker 0: and even now like any game you're at a lot of people leave MSG early and it is almost Exclusively people who live in New Jersey who have to catch a train.

685
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:53,350
Speaker 1: Yep So let's talk about quickly seating right.

686
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:55,617
Speaker 1: so most arenas they got seats at different heights.

687
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:59,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, right Usually higher is and farther back is cheaper.

688
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,070
Speaker 0: But the seats themselves are also different.

689
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,933
Speaker 0: in a lot of arenas.

690
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,800
Speaker 0: the class depends depends.

691
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,191
Speaker 1: Yes, some of them outdoor ones sometimes even just have benches or whatever.

692
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,900
Speaker 0: I sat on metal hard bleacher.

693
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:12,351
Speaker 1: But we went to the game in Buffalo.

694
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:13,539
Speaker 1: We sat on the steel benches.

695
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:18,980
Speaker 0: I went a lot of tires game sitting on metal benches like behind the outfield.

696
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:22,252
Speaker 1: Yeah, there aren't a lot of metal benches these days in the newer places.

697
00:49:22,332 --> 00:49:22,452
Speaker 1: Now.

698
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,460
Speaker 1: It's mostly at least a plastic folding seat.

699
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:31,580
Speaker 1: Yeah minimum, but nowadays some of the places have put it in like squishy recliner expensive seeds with cupholders and massage.

700
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,959
Speaker 1: There's like, you know all kinds of non.

701
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,258
Speaker 0: But then different sports have different traditions and different setups like basketball has really close to basketball.

702
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:38,860
Speaker 1: You're in a folding.

703
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like they just set up regular like normal folding chairs like it ever on a poker table.

704
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:46,275
Speaker 0: Just yeah, cuz right next to the game like you could reach out.

705
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,160
Speaker 1: like other sports It's really safe to sit close to basket.

706
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:56,267
Speaker 0: Well, it's like worst case a heavy guy bumps into you and apologizes or a basketball bumps into you like, okay Wait, and most people think that's pretty cool.

707
00:49:56,307 --> 00:49:58,415
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Jack like fell on me.

708
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:00,331
Speaker 0: I would just be like, sorry shack Sorry, I was in your way.

709
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:07,779
Speaker 1: It's like, you know people love that Hockey puck, I don't wanna I don't want that to hit me, you know, nothing to do with it.

710
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,343
Speaker 1: Baseball.

711
00:50:09,363 --> 00:50:10,047
Speaker 1: you got a big net.

712
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:10,691
Speaker 1: Thank good.

713
00:50:10,731 --> 00:50:11,496
Speaker 1: You don't want to get hit by that.

714
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:13,515
Speaker 0: if you're a little kid You probably have your catchers met with you.

715
00:50:14,363 --> 00:50:15,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you still don't want to get hit by that.

716
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:17,779
Speaker 1: Yeah That's too dangerous.

717
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,880
Speaker 1: But not only that but you also have some luxury box action, right?

718
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:28,136
Speaker 1: I've been a few a few but work never never except for work.

719
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,649
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a few different kinds of luxury boxes these days.

720
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:35,020
Speaker 1: Most arenas have three kinds at least main three main kind.

721
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:35,983
Speaker 0: That's a good point.

722
00:50:36,064 --> 00:50:37,067
Speaker 0: They are different now.

723
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:39,536
Speaker 1: There's there's one kind which is the.

724
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:46,680
Speaker 1: I Have I'm having a group event like a birthday party and I shelled out big and there's a special box just for that.

725
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:48,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like a luxury box.

726
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:54,423
Speaker 1: That's Kez catering or whatever right and pretty much anyone can get that if you pay enough money and it's not like in the old RIT arena.

727
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,618
Speaker 0: there was one luxury box technically and you could just rent it like just pay money.

728
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,427
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, the second kind is the.

729
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:05,920
Speaker 1: there are many small luxury boxes and each of them is individually owned, right?

730
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,121
Speaker 1: Like.

731
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:07,909
Speaker 1: I've sat in like at various events.

732
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,060
Speaker 1: I was in like a Pepsi luxury box once right?

733
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:22,620
Speaker 1: Pepsi owned that box or at least it or whatever and basically no matter what event was held in that arena Stadium Right Pepsi there were some seats that were in the box, right?

734
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,899
Speaker 1: Pepsi had the rights to those seats.

735
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:25,563
Speaker 1: You couldn't.

736
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,598
Speaker 1: just no one else could buy those tickets except Pepsi the company.

737
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:30,669
Speaker 0: And that's something a lot of people don't know.

738
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:35,133
Speaker 0: that if you want if you own a luxury box Yeah, you got to buy tickets to anything you want to write kid.

739
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:36,420
Speaker 1: Just so it's like, okay, right?

740
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,780
Speaker 1: So let's say there's a BTS concert at the stadium, right?

741
00:51:40,243 --> 00:51:42,880
Speaker 1: Pepsi doesn't just automatically get tickets to that.

742
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:49,220
Speaker 1: They just have these tickets for those seats that are set aside and they can either buy them or not.

743
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:53,139
Speaker 1: And if they buy them they can give them to whoever they like, right?

744
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,970
Speaker 0: But nobody said no one goes.

745
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:57,840
Speaker 1: that box sits there empty, right?

746
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,459
Speaker 1: Even though Pepsi can decorate the box all they want, you know They can get free catering in the box when they use it.

747
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:06,399
Speaker 1: They could all this, you know get all this bonuses along with the box.

748
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,114
Speaker 1: But you have to buy tickets to sit in your own box if you want to.

749
00:52:10,415 --> 00:52:25,664
Speaker 1: you just basically have Guaranteed tickets to any event that were to happen in that space Unless you know I guess sometimes there might be like a concert and if the state your your box might be like behind the stage and not available In which case tough cookies.

750
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,311
Speaker 1: Yep, and the third kind right?

751
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:30,277
Speaker 1: There's a lot of places have this.

752
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:31,480
Speaker 1: it's basically the club.

753
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:35,220
Speaker 1: There'll be some kind of sponsored club or multiple sponsored clubs.

754
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,660
Speaker 0: I feel like there's a lot more of these lately like over there.

755
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,155
Speaker 1: They're very popular because they're all sponsored right and basically what these are.

756
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:48,880
Speaker 1: it's a way for a wealthy person To basically have a season ticket, but the season ticket is in this club.

757
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:54,500
Speaker 1: So it's like they share a luxury box with many other rich people that they don't know, right?

758
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,860
Speaker 1: They couldn't afford to just reserve a whole box just for themselves.

759
00:52:58,623 --> 00:53:13,373
Speaker 1: But they're wealthy enough that they can get a season ticket that comes with like in a special zone With like their own bar and their own wait staff and their own everything Right and their own special luxuries and fancy seats and TVs and lounges.

760
00:53:13,754 --> 00:53:16,100
Speaker 1: It's sort of like every airplane lounge deal.

761
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:17,306
Speaker 1: Right now you're in there.

762
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:24,800
Speaker 1: You have enough money to get special treatment But you're in there with all the other people you don't know that also have paid for special tree.

763
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,607
Speaker 0: They're a lot like airport lounges.

764
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:28,917
Speaker 1: Yes, you know, they're not bad though.

765
00:53:28,937 --> 00:53:29,680
Speaker 1: They usually good seats.

766
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,858
Speaker 1: I've been in them a couple times and I gotta say I like.

767
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,462
Speaker 0: I Have pro.

768
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:34,324
Speaker 1: there are pros and cons.

769
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:37,053
Speaker 0: the luxury box if I was mega-rich, I might.

770
00:53:37,454 --> 00:53:52,620
Speaker 0: I would also consider I could see Family luxury box and like just bring people to it and see games, but yeah gotta remember Luxury boxes are not necessarily the best way to see a sport if the sport itself is what you care about because they're fun.

771
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,385
Speaker 0: Like don't get me wrong.

772
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:55,439
Speaker 0: I don't I don't dislike a luxury box.

773
00:53:55,861 --> 00:54:00,580
Speaker 0: If someone invites me to one like in May, I guess we're gonna get a big box for my team at Yankee Stadium.

774
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:02,226
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna go there and see a game.

775
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:12,661
Speaker 0: I tried to convince them for the Mets and they were not here to me, but They aren't the best seats compared to like the actually expensive good seats Like.

776
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:13,484
Speaker 1: nope,

777
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:14,928
Speaker 0: if you want if you care about

778
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:17,315
Speaker 1: some some places they are but usually rarely

779
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:26,134
Speaker 0: like you really care about hockey And you want to sit like near the glass like if you like sitting close Sitting in the lower ring is way better than sitting in the luxury boxes.

780
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:27,199
Speaker 0: They're pretty high up.

781
00:54:27,623 --> 00:54:29,159
Speaker 0: Some of them are even higher than where we sit.

782
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,482
Speaker 1: Hmm, you know, there's also, you know depends on the arena where the luxury boxes are exactly right, you know There's.

783
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:36,551
Speaker 1: there might be some on the end.

784
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:41,880
Speaker 0: It's like, okay I've seen places where there are a few like luxury boxes that are like right down at ice level.

785
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:43,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could you could be any.

786
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:45,011
Speaker 0: they're like stay like like.

787
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:47,060
Speaker 0: you see a little dip and then there's a glass wall and some.

788
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:52,280
Speaker 0: There's no way to get to those seats except through a basically a secret door from the actual luxury box that's there.

789
00:54:52,641 --> 00:54:54,268
Speaker 0: But they always often have the same format of.

790
00:54:54,308 --> 00:55:00,899
Speaker 0: there's the box area and then there's like a bunch of seats Outside the box like at the edge of wherever the luxury box is.

791
00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:03,588
Speaker 0: Usually those are seats you technically purchased.

792
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,555
Speaker 1: Yeah now we did.

793
00:55:06,157 --> 00:55:09,980
Speaker 1: I do want to talk about Stadium food, but I think we can make a separate episode.

794
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,340
Speaker 0: I think we'll have to because I have a lot of opinions on stadium food.

795
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:19,060
Speaker 1: So much going on there, but I do just want to close briefly talking about the non sports at the arenas, right?

796
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,996
Speaker 1: So, you know, I've seen like the circus at the arena, you know, it's like.

797
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,700
Speaker 1: yeah, it's fine It's a sir, you know, where else are you gonna put a sir?

798
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,495
Speaker 0: I saw Sesame Street live and Muppet Babies live at Cobo Hall when I was a little kid.

799
00:55:31,117 --> 00:55:36,410
Speaker 1: I've seen some X on ice at various, you know, maybe Hartford Civic Center.

800
00:55:36,651 --> 00:55:39,800
Speaker 0: I saw Chris cross perform at Cobo Hall once right?

801
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:42,731
Speaker 1: Yes, let's have a concerts at arenas, right?

802
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:55,155
Speaker 1: I am not a huge fan of Concert at an even if it's someone I really really really like like my favorite band in the universe or whatever Right at an arena to go see them.

803
00:55:55,316 --> 00:56:00,660
Speaker 1: It's like Okay, maybe it might be good if it's like that time we saw tool in Albany, right?

804
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:03,320
Speaker 1: It's like you don't need to see tool, right?

805
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,243
Speaker 1: It's like what is there to look?

806
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:10,786
Speaker 1: you need to feel tool via all the people around you, right and having a giant You know general admission mosh pit.

807
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:12,852
Speaker 1: Okay, that works out kind of right.

808
00:56:12,972 --> 00:56:13,434
Speaker 1: It's okay.

809
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:15,560
Speaker 1: I'd still rather have a smaller place though, right?

810
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:21,360
Speaker 1: But if it's like an act where I actually want to see them, right?

811
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,719
Speaker 1: I got something to look at maybe some dancing right or some.

812
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:26,349
Speaker 1: you know I'm really there to listen to them.

813
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:30,378
Speaker 1: the acoustics are not the best in the arena Not the way they would be at a concert hall, right?

814
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:36,800
Speaker 0: Brooklyn Steel if I want to hear I would be in like Lincoln Center, right exactly.

815
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,047
Speaker 1: So it's like an arena isn't the best for seeing.

816
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:45,980
Speaker 1: it isn't the best for hearing right and it's like, you know a lot of time the seeing is just gonna be like.

817
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,653
Speaker 1: You know these giant video screens a lot of people set up and it's like.

818
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:52,212
Speaker 1: well if you're I'm just looking at video screens Why don't I just get the concert DVD and watch it at home?

819
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:53,519
Speaker 1: Why should I be here?

820
00:56:53,901 --> 00:56:59,503
Speaker 1: It's like and they charge so much more money because it costs so much more money to set this thing up Right.

821
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:00,265
Speaker 1: It's like.

822
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:04,180
Speaker 1: I'm just not a fan of any concert no matter how much I like the group.

823
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,794
Speaker 0: So what I am a fan of and you can't always do this is some concerts.

824
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:16,292
Speaker 0: you can get the luxury box tickets And if you go to a luxury box at a big stadium concert with a bunch of friends It just becomes a hangout.

825
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,340
Speaker 0: or our concerts happening.

826
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,800
Speaker 0: But that unless you get a good deal or get lucky that is a lot of money for a very relatively diminished return.

827
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:40,451
Speaker 1: Now I am gonna you know caveat by saying any time the few times I've gone to an arena concert It was always a general admission or a faraway seat or I was never paying big money to get close because I Didn't care enough to get close.

828
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:41,680
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna I didn't have the money.

829
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:47,632
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna spend that much right, but there is an upcoming K-pop concert right.

830
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:57,339
Speaker 1: mamamoo is coming to The islanders place EBS, right and I'm like, I'm like, alright, they've never come here before it's or they're probably not gonna come again.

831
00:57:57,801 --> 00:57:59,024
Speaker 1: Right, we like them.

832
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:01,410
Speaker 1: they're like the best live ever right.

833
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:04,739
Speaker 1: so it's like let's pay to get close at least right.

834
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,280
Speaker 1: so We can see we're in like the 12th row.

835
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:09,920
Speaker 0: It cost a shit ton of money like the last time I went to Lincoln Center.

836
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,184
Speaker 0: It was a. it was a classical like piano act I was really interested in.

837
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:17,535
Speaker 0: so we sat in the second row and you know what those seats cost a lot more than a hockey game.

838
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for that I could.

839
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,017
Speaker 1: you could have sit far away and it would be in the mezzanine.

840
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:21,460
Speaker 1: you'd be fine.

841
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:28,093
Speaker 0: Well, cuz it was I wanted to see too because this if you sit that close You're right next to the guy playing the piano like crazy.

842
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:29,680
Speaker 1: No, you want to see his hands?

843
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,303
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it was.

844
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:33,600
Speaker 0: it was something to see his hands like you could hear him hitting the piano.

845
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,876
Speaker 1: It was well, I mean with kpop you want to see someone dance.

846
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:36,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

847
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,266
Speaker 1: So it's I don't need I don't?

848
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:41,470
Speaker 0: you don't want to be so close that you just see like their legs Right, so I'm gonna find out.

849
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:47,020
Speaker 1: I guess for the first time I've lived this long and I still never sat close at an arena concert, right?

850
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:56,593
Speaker 1: So it's like is the arena concert acceptable if you pay a fortune to be fucking close as if you know You're as close as you would be in a smaller place?

851
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:57,860
Speaker 1: and I'll find out the answer to that.

852
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:01,880
Speaker 1: But again, it costs a fortune and probably isn't worth it very often at all.

853
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,235
Speaker 0: So the listener had a comment that made me laugh.

854
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:04,980
Speaker 0: quote.

855
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:23,800
Speaker 0: I bet the line for the bathroom at that crisscross concert was needlessly long due to all the backward pants and a lot of people wore their jeans backward to that concert and it was actually a problem because it's really hard to pee and Like backward jeans are not comfortable after about 20 minutes.

856
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,110
Speaker 0: But yes, I'm speaking from personal experience.

857
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,780
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pretend I wasn't all-in on that concert.

858
00:59:30,821 --> 00:59:40,820
Speaker 0: but last thing bathrooms, uh Bathrooms in arenas are generally the worst possible thing and are to be avoided at all cost.

859
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:51,260
Speaker 0: I've been in the places where you if you're a man with a penis and peeing into a trough Surrounded by easily a hundred other men some of whom are facing you on the other side.

860
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,230
Speaker 0: That is that is not a great experience.

861
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:59,880
Speaker 1: Listen, I was like a teenager and I had basically that experience.

862
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,773
Speaker 1: I was peeing at a NASCAR race deal.

863
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:06,023
Speaker 1: You can't beat that one that Monster truck show.

864
01:00:06,786 --> 01:00:09,053
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I think those are about equivalent.

865
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:09,895
Speaker 0: That is the.

866
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:18,220
Speaker 0: I was pissing into a trough Surrounded by men who were peeing as long as Tom Hanks in a league of their own because they had consumed more alcohol.

867
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:22,073
Speaker 1: I think that was the first time I saw a trough and like I wasn't totally sure.

868
01:00:22,515 --> 01:00:26,049
Speaker 0: I was sure because there were like a Dozen men pissing into it like a racehorses.

869
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:36,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like really I Have stood in bathroom lines that were like 20 or 30 minutes long just to pee at sports events.

870
01:00:36,702 --> 01:00:41,030
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, that's the thing is like on the one hand if the sport at the event You're at is so exciting.

871
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:46,460
Speaker 1: You don't want to miss any of it You might have to just wait in the line and go during the break in between quarters in between.

872
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:58,932
Speaker 0: That's why I see a lot of people get up and run With two minutes to go in a period because they're running to piss and then to buy more beer and get back to their seat Exactly, but sometimes it's like if it's really boring or it's a blowout.

873
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,780
Speaker 1: you can just go in between, you know, whatever.

874
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:05,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if it's really exciting then y'all you're just gonna have to deal with it.

875
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,381
Speaker 0: But I will.

876
01:01:06,482 --> 01:01:13,202
Speaker 0: modern arenas are better and better at this like indeed even MSG is not that bad It is.

877
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:19,380
Speaker 0: it's not the bottom that I've encountered by a wide margin even if you move NASCAR and monster truck.

878
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:25,349
Speaker 1: I think you've also got different issues depending on Gender disparity and events.

879
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,235
Speaker 0: some events are heavily.

880
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,840
Speaker 0: I remember when we were at PAX.

881
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:32,740
Speaker 0: There's a huge line for the men's bathroom and all the girls we were with for the first time.

882
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,567
Speaker 0: We're like wow how the tables have turned.

883
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:40,220
Speaker 0: my dudes enjoy and they all peed and then they left while we were standing in line.

884
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:47,024
Speaker 1: Yep, that's that's how you know, sometimes you're at the monster truck event and One line is short.

885
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:51,456
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's not a. it's not a sexist thing.

886
01:01:51,496 --> 01:01:52,960
Speaker 1: It's just the reality of it, right?

887
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:54,939
Speaker 1: It's like that's just how it is.

888
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:56,228
Speaker 1: Go to the tail.

889
01:01:56,268 --> 01:01:58,702
Speaker 1: I'm sure if you go to the Taylor Swift concert It's the office.

890
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:03,997
Speaker 0: when we went to that's a footy game in Australia way back that place had.

891
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:05,363
Speaker 1: I didn't go to the bathroom I did.

892
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:07,820
Speaker 0: and cuz I remember I made a bet that I didn't win.

893
01:02:08,243 --> 01:02:14,931
Speaker 0: After that coming out of the bathroom on that kiosk and Fool that I bet like a couple Australian dollars.

894
01:02:15,894 --> 01:02:16,937
Speaker 0: I don't remember when I bet on.

895
01:02:16,997 --> 01:02:20,143
Speaker 0: I didn't understand the kiosk Understand the game.

896
01:02:20,925 --> 01:02:22,269
Speaker 1: I did eventually understand the game.

897
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:28,803
Speaker 0: I kind of get it now, but kind of uh There were more Like.

898
