00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:01,134
Speaker 1: I don't know after.

15
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:07,075
Speaker 1: I'm mostly going so I can say I mean unless this con is awesome I don't think I'm ever gonna go back to a comic-con.

16
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:16,985
Speaker 0: I'm going mostly to see certain people to enhance my pirate sketchbook and To gather information about this convention, so I can report on it.

17
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,497
Speaker 1: if I hadn't already bought my ticket I totally would have copped out and not gone.

18
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,001
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh well.

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,546
Speaker 0: I will see you know.

20
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:26,959
Speaker 0: I think I might actually Depending on what goes on there.

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,465
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll ever go to it again.

22
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:29,690
Speaker 0: That's basically what it is.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,514
Speaker 0: It's like a litmus test.

24
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 1: well considering the track record.

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,126
Speaker 1: I mean they're batting.

26
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:36,582
Speaker 0: Oh right now Yeah, well they only took one swing and it.

27
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,410
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's three strikes.

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,730
Speaker 0: You're out on the convention circuit like it isn't baseball, but I got to give everyone at least two strikes.

29
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:45,238
Speaker 1: I don't know the way it happened.

30
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:46,545
Speaker 1: It wasn't like they just struck.

31
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,574
Speaker 1: it was like They.

32
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:51,070
Speaker 1: someone threw the ball instead of swinging at it.

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,368
Speaker 1: They stood there went by then they beat the catcher to death went after the pitcher Caused a riot and burned down the stadium.

34
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:12,793
Speaker 0: yeah Well this convention does have a slight advantage in that it is so big and high-profile That not as high-profile San Diego But a high-profile enough that there will be a significant anime and gaming presence that I can retreat to if the comic ness Overwhelms me.

35
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:19,860
Speaker 1: yeah, we'll see how well I mean I can't imagine the video game room will be big enough to deal with a number Of people who will be wandering around looking for something to do.

36
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:24,010
Speaker 0: well the video game room was actually the one part of the con I got to see last year, and it was.

37
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:32,030
Speaker 0: It wasn't like an awesome game katsu But he was pretty big and spacious and had games to play and game companies were there.

38
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:35,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway welcome to all of our new listeners.

00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:44,879
Speaker 1: I would mostly like to say to anyone who has joined the forums and not gotten an approval email You actually did and your hotmail spam filter blocked it.

41
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,149
Speaker 1: we have yet to not approve a single one of you.

42
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:52,085
Speaker 0: Yes, many people have applied and all have been given the thumbs up.

43
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:57,688
Speaker 0: if you use hotmail You just won't find out that you've got the thumbs up because your email is crappy.

44
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:58,210
Speaker 0: get gmail.

45
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:02,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally, but anyway in the news here because I'm gonna get right along.

46
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,130
Speaker 1: We did a long show last night, and we've been generally going along for a while now.

47
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:08,390
Speaker 1: I don't want to run out the biggest libsyn.

48
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, we run out of libsyn.

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,695
Speaker 0: We're gonna have.

50
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,348
Speaker 0: our four nights a week is gonna turn into three real quick.

51
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:20,130
Speaker 1: actually I already talked to him and we could very easily pay to get better libsyn service beyond what is offered on the website.

52
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:27,428
Speaker 1: Well if we ever get near the quota That's I think what we're gonna do, but anyway in it We got a little bit of local color here cuz I just find this hilarious.

53
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,121
Speaker 1: now There are two malls up in the in Dutchess County.

54
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:38,486
Speaker 1: You know the mid Hudson Valley one of which is Old and decrepit and is eventually going to be torn down, but it's awesome.

55
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:39,550
Speaker 1: Oh, it's totally awesome.

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:50,990
Speaker 1: It has an anime store in it not, but while it's awesome Notwithstanding it is decrepit and falling apart and almost no one goes there and a lot of the stores are empty And you could totally rent one for cheap for cheap.

57
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,147
Speaker 1: You could probably rent one for free just to keep the place from looking like it's empty.

58
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:54,730
Speaker 0: we should.

59
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,869
Speaker 1: But there's also a mall directly next to it.

60
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:03,790
Speaker 1: That is not new and fancy, but it's pretty much the newest mall around here, and it's a standard normal mall.

61
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,718
Speaker 1: It's no better than the one in Rochester.

62
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,847
Speaker 0: It's your standard two-story American mall.

63
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:08,590
Speaker 0: It's got a target.

64
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,574
Speaker 0: It's got a Best Buy.

65
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,020
Speaker 0: It's got a bunch of department stores.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,883
Speaker 0: It's got an EB.

67
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:13,429
Speaker 0: It's got a food court.

68
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:21,240
Speaker 1: now The weird thing about this mall is a normal mall as a giant parking lot, but for some godforsaken reason I still to this day can't fathom why they would do this.

69
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:23,770
Speaker 1: they have a big enough parking lot already.

70
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:24,876
Speaker 1: It's plenty big.

71
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:25,842
Speaker 1: it goes around the whole thing.

72
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:26,868
Speaker 1: There's plenty of land around it.

73
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:44,470
Speaker 1: They built on one side of it this one extra story parking garage That was so shoddily put together and put up against the mall and had like these horrible support beams Everywhere under it was just useless hard to get into hard to get out of and eyesore.

74
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:45,774
Speaker 0: What were they thinking?

75
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:50,809
Speaker 1: well technology back then existed to make a better parking garage, and they had enough parking.

76
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:51,230
Speaker 0: anyway.

77
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:53,470
Speaker 0: It's not really a parking garage, it's more like a deck.

78
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:59,943
Speaker 0: It's like there's a parking there's a parking lot and then raised above it on Stilts and I beams is another parking lot.

79
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:04,470
Speaker 0: that way if you park up there You can just walk right into the Best Buy on the second floor.

80
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:13,450
Speaker 0: You know cuz the only other way to park and walk into the second floor of the mall is at the target You know and the Best Buy is isn't the targets on the bottom floor?

81
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:14,756
Speaker 0: I don't even realize.

82
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,467
Speaker 0: I can't even remember how this mall is laid out.

83
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:22,306
Speaker 1: regardless They had this this terrible just poorly thought-out parking garage.

84
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:27,984
Speaker 0: I think a long time ago They must have built that thing and paid nothing for it, and it's a piece of shit.

85
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:29,329
Speaker 1: wasn't the malls not that old?

86
00:05:30,232 --> 00:05:30,694
Speaker 0: I don't know.

87
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:31,035
Speaker 0: man.

88
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:33,506
Speaker 0: a parking thing looked pretty old.

89
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:33,747
Speaker 1: No.

90
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:34,390
Speaker 1: It's not old.

91
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,998
Speaker 1: They just didn't want to pay money.

92
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,410
Speaker 1: the thing is built like in that shoddy way.

93
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:46,489
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the mall next to my house as like two different parking decks and that are the same kind of thing on opposite ends Of the mall, but they're sturdy as all hell.

94
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,633
Speaker 0: They're not going anywhere.

95
00:05:48,054 --> 00:06:05,230
Speaker 1: so the interesting story here is that apparently during the snowstorm that had happened right before Katsu khan last week There was a lot of snow and the people who are in charge of the mall decided to have all of the snow from around The top of it plowed into one area of it and it proceeded to collapse.

96
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,198
Speaker 0: Well, it was funny.

97
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,110
Speaker 0: Is that the thing was already sort of collapsing?

98
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,626
Speaker 0: I mean there was an area of the parking deck that you weren't allowed to park in.

99
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,410
Speaker 0: that was roped off.

100
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,370
Speaker 1: We weren't allowed to park under it either, and it was ever-growing.

101
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:17,312
Speaker 0: Yeah And it was.

102
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:24,699
Speaker 0: you could actually stand there and in the safe part of the safe part of the deck and look at the collapsing Part and go wow that's totally collapsing.

103
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,459
Speaker 0: and if I had any forethought at all I would have realized hey You know when it snows that's gonna put a lot of weight on that area And it's gonna cave in.

104
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,510
Speaker 1: someone see it wouldn't have it.

105
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,093
Speaker 1: It was fine.

106
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:46,930
Speaker 1: the thing is they when they were plowing the top of it They use big big bulldozers instead of normal little snow plows, and they pushed all the snow into that area Because that way it would be out of the way of the cars cuz no one could park there anyway.

107
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,397
Speaker 0: What were they thinking?

108
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,809
Speaker 1: I think they were thinking I don't know.

109
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,639
Speaker 0: Well the evil parking lot of doom finally collapsed.

110
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,664
Speaker 0: will they build a new one question mark?

111
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:04,319
Speaker 1: now the funny thing is the the local Municipal government has well has the power to.

112
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,124
Speaker 1: they haven't said if they're going to do it.

113
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:09,957
Speaker 1: yet find them up to a $1,000.

114
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:10,581
Speaker 0: I thought they did.

115
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,170
Speaker 0: they gave him a ticket for a thousand dollars.

116
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,114
Speaker 1: They said they were going to.

117
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:20,029
Speaker 1: I knew I never saw anything that they actually did and they have the option of Assigning some trivial amount of jail time, but they said they're not going to pursue it.

118
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:25,950
Speaker 1: Man when the it's the same ticket that they'd give some guy if the deck in front of his house collapsed.

119
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:35,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if someone had like a shoddy deck Basically the the you're breaking code you should be forced to fix it.

120
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,270
Speaker 0: Wait a minute wait a minute.

121
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:41,690
Speaker 1: You're the one who not too long ago tried to argue with me that we shouldn't have any sort of building code whatsoever.

122
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,828
Speaker 0: The difference here is that you've got a mall that people are going to.

123
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:51,247
Speaker 1: oh So suddenly there is a rationale for having building codes if it's a publicly traveled place.

124
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:55,061
Speaker 0: Oh, that's it Not if it's a private house where you're not inviting anyone over.

125
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,390
Speaker 1: That's a bit of a reversal from your previous position.

126
00:07:57,472 --> 00:08:08,167
Speaker 1: but anyway I just thought this was funny because it the fact that this thing collapsed due to human stupidity and the fact that it's been There for so long and I just plus more importantly I couldn't find anything else.

127
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:08,990
Speaker 1: I wanted to talk about.

128
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,221
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about Britney Spears or Anna Nicole.

129
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:12,803
Speaker 1: What's-her-name?

130
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:14,610
Speaker 1: I'm still not entirely clear on who that is.

131
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:15,392
Speaker 0: I'm not.

132
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:23,742
Speaker 0: I'm only partially sure of who that is and I know her Britney Spears is but I don't know About anything she's done since I was in high school.

133
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,270
Speaker 1: There's some guy named kay fed.

134
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,610
Speaker 1: I think he's a rapper something who knew her.

135
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:28,144
Speaker 1: I don't know.

136
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:34,190
Speaker 1: There's all that news and then there's all that political news that if you want political news just go to our forums.

137
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone else is talking about it.

138
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:36,580
Speaker 0: Not me.

139
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,062
Speaker 0: I don't care.

140
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:38,607
Speaker 1: So that's all I got.

141
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:38,970
Speaker 1: What do you want?

142
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:43,422
Speaker 0: Alright, so I don't know if you've noticed but there was a crazy kid.

143
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:44,385
Speaker 0: I don't know.

144
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:44,706
Speaker 0: I forget.

145
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,170
Speaker 0: where was it, Georgia?

146
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:53,089
Speaker 0: I wasn't paying attention to where it was and He was bad and he killed the homeless guy.

147
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,566
Speaker 1: Wait, so he was bad and independent of that he killed a whole.

148
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:57,510
Speaker 0: no not independent of that.

149
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,715
Speaker 0: He was bad and he killed it.

150
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:00,543
Speaker 0: He was a bad kid who killed a homeless guy.

151
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:04,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently for fun Yeah, and he was like, yeah, I did it.

152
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,139
Speaker 0: What of it?

153
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,087
Speaker 1: and I do what I want.

154
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:07,990
Speaker 1: I do what I want.

155
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:18,955
Speaker 0: He was a bad dude and he blamed it on video games or of course even if he didn't the media totally tried to pin it on the video games as usual and penny arcade had the usual comment.

156
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:26,607
Speaker 0: like here we go again and I can't be sure if it's true or not, you know, cuz I'm always skeptical.

157
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:36,826
Speaker 0: but supposedly the stepmother of this bad kid is a penny arcade reader who sent a big letter to Gabe and Gabe put the letter on The penny arcade website.

158
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:43,743
Speaker 0: now if it's actually from the stepmom who knows I'm 75% sure It's real and 25% sure It's not regardless.

159
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:48,740
Speaker 1: I suggest you read it because I have met people who have been in similar situations to what this woman is describing.

160
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,182
Speaker 1: Yep.

161
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:53,278
Speaker 0: Now I read the letter like two times and I read it and I said, huh?

162
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:59,566
Speaker 0: You're right There is nothing you could have done, you know, you had this horrible kid, you know You tried real hard as parents.

163
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,477
Speaker 0: you you did everything you possibly could.

164
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:03,300
Speaker 0: you punished him?

165
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,540
Speaker 0: You tried positive enforcement negative reinforcement counseling talking to people.

166
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:12,736
Speaker 0: You did pretty much everything in your power to do and the kid remained bad.

167
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:14,100
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, his brother was good.

168
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:17,174
Speaker 0: So you're obviously doing some sort of parenting, right?

169
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:18,460
Speaker 0: What is the deal?

170
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,767
Speaker 1: so Scott comes home and I hadn't read this.

171
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:27,289
Speaker 1: so he's showing it to me on the Mac downstairs was sitting on the couch and He's like, yeah, I agree with there's nothing you could have done.

172
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:30,320
Speaker 1: and then and I say what about military school?

173
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:34,220
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I sweet sorta came up with it like hey there is something you could have done.

174
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, could have sent the kid to military school and the internet seems to be agreeing with us.

175
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,799
Speaker 1: Yes, however, then we looked it up and military school is not as prevalent as it used to be.

176
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of like the same issue with nut houses.

177
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:52,340
Speaker 0: like back in the day We had nut houses But they were terrible places and you would never want to send anyone to one of those nut houses no matter how nutty they were.

178
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:57,080
Speaker 0: So they got rid of the nut houses and now we have nuts roaming the streets.

179
00:10:57,321 --> 00:11:00,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know as bad we talk a lot.

180
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:11,280
Speaker 1: Well, we don't but we as a nation talk a lot about the homeless problem in major cities But all the statistics so show that the majority of those people who aren't in shelters and getting help are also insane.

181
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows that they went insane because of homelessness?

182
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:18,585
Speaker 0: or if they are homeless because of insanity It's probably a mixture of both who knows?

183
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:28,680
Speaker 0: but the fact is they're insane now and they're homeless now and they need help and we need A good nut house to take care of these people, but we have to pay for it with some taxes.

184
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,469
Speaker 0: Yeah Now the thing is the same thing with bad kids.

185
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:35,708
Speaker 0: you have bad kids and we got nothing to do with them and no Parent can control them.

186
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:46,323
Speaker 0: We need some sort of military Academy boarding school to send these kids to because the only other option seems to be that they're gonna kill a homeless guy and go To jail granted.

187
00:11:46,443 --> 00:12:00,406
Speaker 1: I still think that in most cases a kid while the parent might not have intentionally done anything Or might not have even been a particularly bad parent There were just some set of factors in the way they raised the kid possibly due to not Punishing them enough when they were young.

188
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:05,160
Speaker 1: if they did bad things or not not teaching them proper respect or just not I don't know.

189
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,049
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things.

190
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,220
Speaker 0: there are a lot of things.

191
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,340
Speaker 0: I mean there was some guy who pointed out like he looked into the ages of the people involved.

192
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,708
Speaker 0: He's like hey you had these kids when you're way young.

193
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:22,179
Speaker 0: He's like you're 29 and the kids 14. wonder You got a problem taking care of them something something and I was like, maybe I don't know.

194
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my brother and I turned out just fine.

195
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:28,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, despite the fact that as kids we actually had almost no.

196
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:34,900
Speaker 1: in fact in high school I always was amazed because I didn't have any curfews or anything and I had a credit card to pay for gas for my car.

197
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,299
Speaker 1: That was all I was supposed to use it for and pretty much I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted to.

198
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,996
Speaker 1: my parents Trusted me and I never knocked over a bank or killed a homeless guy.

199
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:50,540
Speaker 0: Yeah The thing is no one is quite really sure what the factors are that make people turn out the way they are.

200
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,380
Speaker 0: It's sort of like random baking you put a bun in the oven and you never know what comes out.

201
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,051
Speaker 0: Well, if you're a good maker you do yeah, but you just kind of have to.

202
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:05,984
Speaker 0: it's like mystery baking not actual baking You know, but when a bad kid comes out and we're in nut comes out you gotta have something to do with them.

203
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:15,171
Speaker 0: and therefore we say that there should be good nice nut houses and Practical military and boarding academies of some sort.

204
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:17,400
Speaker 1: now you might be thinking wait a minute rim and scot.

205
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,044
Speaker 1: But you always say you're libertarians.

206
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:27,205
Speaker 1: How come you're for, you know spending tax dollars on something and one libertarian with a lower case L and Two common good.

207
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:31,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, would you rather have nuts walking around the street?

208
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,025
Speaker 0: It's what I mean.

209
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:40,880
Speaker 0: sure you're free to walk around the street But if you're a nut or if you're a bad person who's gonna you know, kill people then you're a danger to others.

210
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:45,380
Speaker 0: Which is you've gone beyond your freedom and we need to take you out somehow.

211
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:50,565
Speaker 0: and if we're gonna do that then we need somewhere to put you and that's what that's all that is.

212
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,450
Speaker 1: now Scott doesn't drink alcohol at all and I drink it in moderation.

213
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,800
Speaker 1: I like wine with dinner and I like an occasional southern comfort at a convention.

214
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:06,970
Speaker 0: I like me some grape juice and some grape juice.

215
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:09,581
Speaker 1: Yeah, you like grape juice before it's turned into wine.

216
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:10,765
Speaker 1: You like that wuss juice.

217
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,231
Speaker 0: It's so great It like.

218
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,937
Speaker 0: it totally cleans out everything.

219
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:17,350
Speaker 1: I will actually say I don't particularly enjoy grape juice.

220
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:22,165
Speaker 1: You suck at all you suck, but I really like wine and I really like other juices and nectars.

221
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:23,389
Speaker 0: Oh good for you.

222
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:23,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

223
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:25,734
Speaker 1: but anyway one thing.

224
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:29,366
Speaker 1: I read about this a long time ago in a guide on how to drink.

225
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:36,384
Speaker 1: like a Russian and Apparently in Russia, there is a huge huge social stigma to drinking alone.

226
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,630
Speaker 1: That is the sign of a sad individual.

227
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,914
Speaker 1: Well, I tend to agree.

228
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:41,058
Speaker 0: Well that agree.

229
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:42,202
Speaker 0: That's true everywhere.

230
00:14:42,222 --> 00:14:43,326
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I agree with it.

231
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:51,706
Speaker 0: It's very much like it's especially stigmatized in Russia for various reasons Because Russia has a huge alcoholism problem and they try to thwart it.

232
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,770
Speaker 1: with social stigma I mean apparently what alcoholics will do in Russia.

233
00:14:54,911 --> 00:15:03,810
Speaker 1: I read this however in dig is That they'll stand outside a bar and wait for other Alcoholics to gather and then they'll pretend to be friends and go in so they can all drink and not look like losers.

234
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:12,389
Speaker 1: So some enterprising young person has decided to create a product to mitigate this very very important problem of.

235
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,078
Speaker 1: I Am alone and I want to drink.

236
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,729
Speaker 1: So now we have the USB shot glass.

237
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,119
Speaker 0: Hey, so you go to liquor store.

238
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,203
Speaker 0: you buy some Vodak.

239
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,689
Speaker 0: Yes, you bring it home.

240
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:33,901
Speaker 1: Yep, you pour it into your USB shot glass Which is plugged into your computer and you're plugged into a chat room with some sort of Vodak meter Software and a bunch of other lonely alcoholics.

241
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:40,002
Speaker 1: you then proceed to drink with these people Via this online mechanism pouring your own Vodak.

242
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,106
Speaker 0: So what is the USB do?

243
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:42,330
Speaker 0: does it cool the Vodak?

244
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,783
Speaker 1: No, no, no, all it does is Show how much Vodak is in your Vodak glass to everyone else.

245
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:50,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, does it count how many Vodaks you've drunken?

246
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,753
Speaker 1: I don't know.

247
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:52,965
Speaker 1: I just assume the software could do.

248
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,470
Speaker 0: how does it know?

249
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,958
Speaker 0: I'm not just pouring the Vodak out back into the bottle.

250
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,122
Speaker 1: if you want to sit there sober hanging out with a bunch of drunk People on the internet, that's your prerogative, but I can get them to think that I've drinking like 80 Vodaks.

251
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:07,789
Speaker 1: I Imagine they'll know in one way or another.

252
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,790
Speaker 0: I don't know why they even need to do this.

253
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:16,010
Speaker 0: You could just use a webcam and then people can see you drink a lot easier than a USB shot glass.

254
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:18,420
Speaker 1: Mostly this is just kind of a silly gadget.

255
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,710
Speaker 1: But two it is a little more practical than a webcam.

256
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,122
Speaker 1: I mean what if you want to be naked while you're drinking?

257
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:24,589
Speaker 1: now, you don't have to worry about that.

258
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,600
Speaker 0: What if you're gonna be naked while you're drinking?

259
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,330
Speaker 0: That's more reason to have a webcam not less.

260
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:29,730
Speaker 1: What if you're ugly?

261
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:35,110
Speaker 0: Dan you deserve to be drinking alone and no one wants to see you or talk to you or drink with you.

262
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,832
Speaker 0: No, it's kind of it's.

263
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:54,950
Speaker 1: while this actual implementation is kind of silly the idea of it's kind of neat They take because when you're drinking with friends one important aspect of it is always no you can see what is in everyone else's glass And you kind of you can gauge the progress you can gauge how much everyone's drinking You know what context and all that and you lose that drinking on the internet.

264
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:57,949
Speaker 1: Of course why you'd want to be drinking on the internet is beyond me.

265
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,947
Speaker 0: I guess I didn't realize that sort of thing was paid attention to because I don't drink.

266
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:07,905
Speaker 1: well Yeah, it is but in Russia because drinking I guess is a much bigger deal.

267
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,869
Speaker 1: There is now this silly device.

268
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,565
Speaker 1: I don't know how seriously people are actually going to take it over there.

269
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,313
Speaker 1: I find it hilarious If nothing else it

270
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:34,389
Speaker 0: is definitely pretty hilarious that eventually there'll be USB everything and then USB will be obsolete and we'll have wireless USB or something else and it'd be crazy All right, so I Often use stories on this podcast about f1 racing which is a sport that I am quite fond of that other people May have varying levels of caring about it.

271
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:40,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm probably the next biggest fan of f1 in the front row crew and I have no desire to watch it at all.

272
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:51,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this guy he's some sort of auto Reviewing for magazine journalist guy and he got a chance to ride in an f1 car.

273
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,364
Speaker 0: now Not just any f1 car a four-year-old f1 car.

274
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:55,866
Speaker 0: So what this is?

275
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,050
Speaker 0: car is old and slow.

276
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:02,283
Speaker 0: Not only is it old and slow It was also one of the slowest and shittiest cars that year.

277
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:10,229
Speaker 0: like it came in last all the time it's a slow and shitty f1 car and he drove it and it was the craziness.

278
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:18,582
Speaker 0: and Even if you don't like f1 or care about racing I think that you should read this little three-page article because it just it'll.

279
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:28,247
Speaker 0: it's the best way to get an idea of exactly why and how f1 is Crazier than every other possible type of racing on the earth.

280
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,970
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I don't enjoy watching it other than maybe the first two laps and the last two laps or the lap or whoever passes whoever.

281
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,852
Speaker 1: And other than I don't care.

282
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:42,130
Speaker 1: but the technology behind f1 is actually a big deal and it's really neat science.

283
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:54,460
Speaker 0: yeah, and this guy like He's driving this car like 170 miles an hour and he approaches this turn and he's fearing for his life because he's going so Incredibly fast, you know, like basically everything's a blur.

284
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,744
Speaker 0: You can't even see what's going on.

285
00:18:56,126 --> 00:19:02,625
Speaker 0: So he steps on the brakes and The brakes are so incredibly powerful that he actually broke too soon.

286
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:06,317
Speaker 0: and then you realize what you compare his speed.

287
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:14,806
Speaker 0: it's like the speed of Michael Schumacher the greatest driver and The the guy who drove this car in races who was the shittiest f1 driver.

288
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:30,630
Speaker 0: and you go wow I'm totally not laughing at that shitty f1 driver anymore because that guy went into this crazy turn at ludicrous speed and broke Later, yeah, I mean the worst driver at f1 is still one of the best drivers in the world.

289
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually pretty big news.

290
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:41,746
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've been paying attention but in shitty NASCAR a Former f1 driver and possibly soon two former f1 drivers will be are racing in NASCAR.

291
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:42,508
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

292
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:45,862
Speaker 0: Yeah JPM is Juan Pablo Montoya.

293
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:46,990
Speaker 0: He's driving in NASCAR.

294
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:51,552
Speaker 0: He was in the Daytona 500, but then I think he got crashed in the final lap or something Uh-huh.

295
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:55,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was kind of a crazy race actually the Daytona 500, but whatever.

296
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,150
Speaker 0: It's not as good as the f1s, right?

297
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:09,498
Speaker 1: So tonight kind of a short episode because again, we're tired from katsu khan and we went long last night, obviously Yep, I had a bunch of interviews from last night that instead of putting him in the show because we went long I'll use him for a special someday.

298
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:20,350
Speaker 1: You'll hear and we recorded a bunch of stuff at katsu khan, which was fun Yep, but we've always gone 50/50 on what we're about to do since on one hand people Well half of our listeners really like geek backs.

299
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,350
Speaker 1: You know where we read email or stuff from the forums or things people send us and they won't tell us to have more.

300
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,449
Speaker 1: They send us email in hopes of being on the show.

301
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:32,010
Speaker 1: And on the other hand the other half of our listeners hate it and don't want to hear from other people.

302
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,873
Speaker 1: They want to hear from us.

303
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:37,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm actually kind of torn on this myself and it seems like it's some podcasts I listen to.

304
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:42,250
Speaker 0: all I want to hear is the hosts talking and I don't want to hear their stupid listeners.

305
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:45,670
Speaker 0: But other podcasts I listen to like dragons landing like dragons landing.

306
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:51,090
Speaker 0: I only want to hear them respond to listener emails and voicemails and I don't give a shit about what they have to say.

307
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,602
Speaker 0: Well, not as much of a shit about what they have to say.

308
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:54,467
Speaker 1: So you don't give a shit.

309
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,130
Speaker 1: Why even listening?

310
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,358
Speaker 0: I listen to the feedback episodes only.

311
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,130
Speaker 0: but yeah, it's kind of a toss-up, you know.

312
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,123
Speaker 0: So I figure we'll do it one more time.

313
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:03,150
Speaker 0: See what the hell happens.

314
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:06,750
Speaker 1: Yep So we'll do tonight partly because it's also a great cop-out episode.

315
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,370
Speaker 1: It requires almost no effort other than looking at all the emails we've gotten.

316
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,601
Speaker 0: It's also a lot of fun and it makes listeners excited.

317
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:13,264
Speaker 0: So why not?

318
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,490
Speaker 1: and also right now?

319
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,385
Speaker 1: I'll tell you all out there that even it and we respond to a lot of the email we get.

320
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:20,954
Speaker 1: but if we don't respond To you, don't worry.

321
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,298
Speaker 1: We read your email.

322
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:23,823
Speaker 1: We read every email we get.

323
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:24,605
Speaker 1: that isn't spam.

324
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:27,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, just some emails I got nothing to say to.

325
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,424
Speaker 0: Mostly if you just send me a link, I got nothing to say to you.

326
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, or if someone just says hey I love the show.

327
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:34,118
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother saying.

328
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:34,479
Speaker 1: Thanks.

329
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,087
Speaker 1: I you thank me enough by listening and I whatever.

330
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:37,970
Speaker 1: I don't worry about it.

331
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:42,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes I do mean to reply and then I just the email.

332
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,110
Speaker 0: I don't reply immediately.

333
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,130
Speaker 0: So the email sits there but it's marked as red so I don't look at again and then you fall down the queue.

334
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:48,962
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.

335
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:56,293
Speaker 1: Yep There's also the fact that sometimes an email we don't really have anything to respond to it or maybe it asks a question that requires A complex answer.

336
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,700
Speaker 1: usually we ruminate on that and eventually do a show on it.

337
00:21:59,161 --> 00:21:59,302
Speaker 0: Yeah.

338
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:02,190
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I'll start off here with the first email.

339
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:03,425
Speaker 1: I wouldn't read that whole thing.

340
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:12,928
Speaker 0: It's long I'm not but basically there's a guy named Mike O'Neill and he has a company called mr Smith which he is the owner and designer and this company sells the Jimmy.

341
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:19,350
Speaker 1: now You may I am I that we a while ago bought these wallets part on the show where it's talked about it.

342
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,997
Speaker 1: So we could try them out because they were kind of weird.

343
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:21,198
Speaker 1: Yes.

344
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:24,230
Speaker 0: The Jimmy is a strange non-standard wallet.

345
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:31,590
Speaker 0: It's basically a small plastic thing that holds credit cards and cash and your ID and all this stuff and it's pretty cool.

346
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:33,744
Speaker 0: And we both use them for wallets.

347
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:35,756
Speaker 1: and yeah I really like the one.

348
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:42,165
Speaker 1: actually whenever I pull my wallet out at least half the time Whoever I'm paying money to says something like wow, what kind of wallet is that?

349
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:43,250
Speaker 1: Where can I get one?

350
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, people always, you know comment like whoa, what kind?

351
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,266
Speaker 0: what's up with that wallet?

352
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:48,070
Speaker 0: Why is it all weird?

353
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:50,990
Speaker 1: And and the company that does you know the Jimmy company?

354
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:55,910
Speaker 1: They're really socially responsible and recycled goods and money to the environment and all that business.

355
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,981
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like 1% of revenue goes the environment whatever.

356
00:22:59,121 --> 00:22:59,563
Speaker 1: that's cool.

357
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:00,326
Speaker 0: It's alright.

358
00:23:00,566 --> 00:23:01,570
Speaker 0: I don't really care either way.

359
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:04,305
Speaker 1: But anyway, well, that's cuz you're a godless heathen.

360
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:04,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

361
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:10,070
Speaker 0: So they also sell some other cool stuff like they have some new like SD card clips.

362
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:14,750
Speaker 0: It's like if you have a lot of SD cards for your digital camera, they have stuff that holds them.

363
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,683
Speaker 1: I was actually thinking again that iPod nano case because my my cover.

364
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:20,810
Speaker 1: it's great for carrying it around.

365
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,282
Speaker 1: It's not so great for listening to stuff while I'm that's right.

366
00:23:23,322 --> 00:23:23,584
Speaker 0: They do.

367
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:24,830
Speaker 0: they sell an iPod nano case.

368
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:26,140
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

369
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:27,330
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get one too anyway.

370
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:40,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Apparently we've told a lot of people about this wallet all the time because people comment on it and someone we told about it Went to the website bought the Jimmy wallet and said they heard about it from geek nights.

371
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:47,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy who runs the company emailed us and he was like, hey someone bought my wallet and they heard about it from you.

372
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,973
Speaker 0: Do you want some stuff?

373
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,121
Speaker 1: Well, mostly he just wanted to say thanks.

374
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:53,550
Speaker 1: And yeah, I think that's cool.

375
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,581
Speaker 1: I mean we weren't trying to promote the product.

376
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,969
Speaker 1: We just actually like the product.

377
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:03,769
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean I bought it sort of randomly like my last wallet died and I said you know what there has to be something better out there than a wallet.

378
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:09,625
Speaker 0: and I actually found a whole bunch of stuff but most of it was expensive or hard to get.

379
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:10,970
Speaker 0: the Jimmy was easy to get.

380
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:19,767
Speaker 0: I Bought it from a website and it was cheap and I figured if this thing doesn't work out for me I'll just put it away and get something else and it's worked out.

381
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:23,482
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool Yeah, so this is not a paid for.

382
00:24:23,502 --> 00:24:25,670
Speaker 1: and yeah, don't think that we're advertising.

383
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:31,510
Speaker 1: I think to all of our new listeners we dislike advertising more than just about anything in the world.

384
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:35,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna take sponsors or sell ads or anything.

385
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,461
Speaker 0: We are legitimately happy with this product and we bought.

386
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:46,470
Speaker 1: we bought it with no persuasion whatsoever In fact, I bought it mostly so I could hate on it and make fun of it And the fact that I liked it was kind of yeah.

387
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:54,810
Speaker 0: And then we used it and we still use it and now the guy who makes it knows about us and he's cool All right, so now here's a fun one.

388
00:24:55,097 --> 00:25:00,685
Speaker 1: Hey guys I've recently started an anime club at my school and I'm having trouble picking a good funny animated screen.

00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:57,161
Speaker 1: if we're gonna make fun of pretty much any mistake you make don't take it Personally, yes, we will make fun of your punctuation and spelling.

405
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,149
Speaker 1: Oh, I see a pretty good typo in the next one on this list.

406
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:08,509
Speaker 0: All right, so yeah if you're looking for more anime it's not really hard to find them.

407
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:21,750
Speaker 0: if Actually if you're someone who you know, you know You want to watch anime, but there's so much anime out there and you've only recently gotten into the hobby or the you know Whatever it is the culture and you're not really, you know, there's thousands of anime.

408
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,095
Speaker 0: Which ones do you watch next?

409
00:26:23,718 --> 00:26:37,639
Speaker 0: a good idea actually is to go to like the anime news network Encyclopedia and you can sort of browse anime by genre and you can like find an anime you like and click on the director and see what else they directed and It's a pretty good way to find shows.

410
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,544

00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:27,826
Speaker 0: as for a computer con.

426
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,116
Speaker 0: That's more difficult I mean, do they really have computer kind?

427
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,180
Speaker 1: Well, there was penguin con.

428
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:43,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, penguin con was a Linux convention in Michigan, Michigan There's Def Con and things like that which like the hacker cons, I think there's one in Vegas and one in New York I'm not sure.

429
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:46,547
Speaker 0: but yeah, what are the kind of computer cons are there?

430
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:47,089
Speaker 0: I don't really know.

431
00:27:47,715 --> 00:27:49,110
Speaker 1: I don't know what I do to computer con.

432
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,810
Speaker 1: I mean, honestly, I there's not much I'm gonna learn from a computer con that I can't just learn from a book or the internet.

433
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:56,909
Speaker 1: And I already went to college.

434
00:27:57,492 --> 00:28:06,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's computer conferences where you can go listen to people give speeches like O'Reilly something something But those cost a lot of money and there's not really.

435
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:07,870
Speaker 0: it's not the same as an anime convention.

436
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,241
Speaker 0: It's not a social fun thing.

437
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,797
Speaker 1: It's just a Well penguin con was a social fun thing.

438
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:19,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, thank God didn't have so much, you know, it was most more sci-fi Gaming going on there.

439
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:21,783
Speaker 1: Oh the panels were almost all computer stuff.

440
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:23,006
Speaker 0: panels were a computer.

441
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:23,969
Speaker 0: That is correct, huh?

442
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:24,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, thank.

443
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,216
Speaker 0: what cons sort of unique in that way.

444
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:26,998
Speaker 0: I don't know.

445
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:28,142
Speaker 0: No computer cons.

446
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,650
Speaker 0: All right, let's pick another email here.

447
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:32,328
Speaker 0: There you go, let's see.

448
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:39,815
Speaker 0: Hey Raymond Scott longtime listener first time mailer love the show and I don't know how you can put the level of content at the quality You do each night.

449
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:40,659
Speaker 0: It's magic.

450
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:42,550
Speaker 0: Oh, all these are exclamation points.

451
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:46,270
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm the first person listening to UK but you are international.

452
00:28:47,571 --> 00:28:51,708
Speaker 1: We have a lot of listeners in Australia and the United Kingdom Albion.

453
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:56,510
Speaker 0: Yes We have a lot of listeners throughout the English-speaking world and outside of the English-speaking world.

454
00:28:56,851 --> 00:29:01,105
Speaker 1: You know where we don't have any listeners is France, oh really as far as I can tell.

455
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,730
Speaker 1: so we got any French listeners.

456
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:04,774
Speaker 1: Give us a shout out.

457
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:05,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see.

458
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,484
Speaker 0: The networking show is really good.

459
00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:12,849
Speaker 0: I did some networking a while ago So it was a good refresher and has got me thinking I need to get up to speed with it all again.

460
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:13,934
Speaker 0: Exclamation point.

461
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:18,130
Speaker 0: please feel free to do another show on this as it was really interesting.

462
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:23,184
Speaker 0: Am I right in thinking that there are certain IP ranges or numbers that cannot be used together?

463
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:26,315
Speaker 0: as I said, I'm rusty man Cheers Rob.

464
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:37,837
Speaker 1: IP ranges or numbers that cannot be used together Really just comes down if you have two separate networks that use the same like if I've got my network that says 10-dot Whatever and someone else has their network.

465
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,864
Speaker 1: That is also internally 10-dot whatever.

466
00:29:39,884 --> 00:29:41,610
Speaker 1: you can't just stick the two together.

467
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,770
Speaker 1: You got to change one of the sides or in some way reconcile.

468
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:49,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, two computers on the same network can't have the same exact IP address.

469
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:53,749
Speaker 1: That's all it comes down Barring fun things like multicast, but we're not.

470
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,710
Speaker 1: Multicast is well beyond the layman's networking thing.

471
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,929
Speaker 1: We're gonna have to do a special show on that and I don't think anyone would want to hear it.

472
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:04,409
Speaker 0: No, that would be a very boring even though I think multicast is really cool.

473
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:06,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, but who uses it?

474
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,043
Speaker 1: a lot of people actually really?

475
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:09,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, we use it IBM for images.

476
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:14,370
Speaker 1: Oh sending, you know reef like sending an image a hard drive image to a hundred machines.

477
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:19,870
Speaker 1: We could multicast it to all those machines at once instead of sending a hundred packets to each machine over and over.

478
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,997
Speaker 0: Doesn't ipv6 have stuff to do with that?

479
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,587
Speaker 1: ipv6 has some awesome stuff like that.

480
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:28,638
Speaker 1: All right I should do a show on ipv6 Maybe about what it is.

481
00:30:28,658 --> 00:30:33,325
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't understand that at all Mostly because well we could do it after we do a show on net.

482
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,763
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, I like this one is nice and short.

483
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:38,050
Speaker 1: just found your podcast.

484
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,410
Speaker 1: I have to tell you that your podcast about IP addressing was awesome.

485
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:45,685
Speaker 1: Would love to show about creating a home network wireless versus wired etc.

486
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:47,010
Speaker 1: Can't wait to hear your other podcast.

487
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,656
Speaker 1: Cheers al from Rhode Island.

488
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,022
Speaker 1: Wow, Rhode Island.

489
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:52,070
Speaker 0: Yeah that stayed so small.

490
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,990
Speaker 0: I didn't think that like there would be anyone in it who listen to podcast.

491
00:30:55,271 --> 00:31:07,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, what I can say is very briefly since that networking and layman's terms run over so well We are going to probably do every aspect of networking with the same level of technical talking in the same level of metaphor.

492
00:31:07,893 --> 00:31:10,646
Speaker 1: So expect a bunch more of those to come as soon as we get around to it.

493
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:12,333
Speaker 0: Ah Let's see.

494
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:15,665
Speaker 0: Oh, here's another one about the IP episode as well.

495
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:19,162
Speaker 0: I don't think I'm gonna read this whole thing But I'll skip to the part.

496
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:20,630
Speaker 0: We actually asked some questions.

497
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:25,410
Speaker 0: I have an idea for a while now and wanted to run it by someone who's interested in your opinion.

498
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:30,623
Speaker 0: Okay, most of the viruses spam malware on the internet is propagated by armies of botnets.

499
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:32,047
Speaker 0: ie infected pcs.

500
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:32,789
Speaker 0: Yep.

501
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:33,210
Speaker 0: That's true.

502
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:42,925
Speaker 0: Most of the viruses are written to send spam and apart from taking a percentage of the resources of machine They don't do anything seriously malicious and consequently most people are unaware that they have them.

503
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:44,370
Speaker 0: that is sort of true.

504
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:53,737
Speaker 0: But a lot of those spywares and things actually will steal your paypals or your eBay's Yes, or all kinds of evil stuff like that.

505
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:57,230
Speaker 1: You may not have met any of them but rest assured it happens.

506
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:58,487
Speaker 0: It happens a lot.

507
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,849
Speaker 0: Sure, there are really bad viruses that collect your credit card details, etc.

508
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:07,130
Speaker 0: But I personally don't know anyone who's had their identity hacked or been the subject of fraud.

509
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,289
Speaker 0: Anyways, what I think we need is a white hat.

510
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:11,475
Speaker 0: I know I don't.

511
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:17,760
Speaker 0: I've actually heard of a lot of people who have been the subject of fraud But I really I got to say right now.

512
00:32:18,182 --> 00:32:19,989
Speaker 0: I don't like this term identity theft.

513
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:26,186
Speaker 0: Identity theft is if I go around the street with rims ID in a rim disguise pretending to be rim.

514
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:27,690
Speaker 0: that is identity theft.

515
00:32:27,851 --> 00:32:34,867
Speaker 0: I mean sure technically if I take rims credit card and buy something with it You could say I'm pretending to be.

516
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:37,095
Speaker 1: well They usually refer to.

517
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:43,993
Speaker 1: when you do identity theft is when you gather enough information about a person who poses them in order to Get lines of credit.

518
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:49,210
Speaker 0: Yes, but you're not actually, you know, your crime is is credit fraud?

519
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,930
Speaker 0: That's the crime, you know, sure you're posing as them because you're using their information instead of your information.

520
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,719
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, but your crime is credit fraud.

521
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:00,762
Speaker 0: identity theft is.

522
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:03,670
Speaker 0: it would be a crime where I pretend to be someone else.

523
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:09,690
Speaker 1: You are pretending to be someone else only technically and not so I disagree with you a hundred percent.

524
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:09,991
Speaker 0: I don't.

525
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,857
Speaker 0: I don't like the way they call it identity theft.

526
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:12,600
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

527
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:13,523
Speaker 1: I'm just.

528
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:15,530
Speaker 0: it's an it's a disagreement about a label.

529
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:18,741
Speaker 1: So I know I'm just saying that I disagree with your assessment.

530
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:20,327
Speaker 0: All right, I obviously.

531
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:28,028
Speaker 0: yes you are Using someone else's identity to achieve a crime of credit fraud, but I don't like calling it identity theft.

532
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:28,710
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

533
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,438
Speaker 1: You're just weird.

534
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:30,288
Speaker 0: You're just weird.

535
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:41,410
Speaker 0: A hacker who basically writes a virus that simply trashes any machine it infects thus schooling the user on the virtues of running a decent OS or at least patching slash protecting it.

536
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,180
Speaker 0: Alright virus writers would never write this.

537
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,990
Speaker 1: I can answer that real quickly.

538
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:48,806
Speaker 1: That used to happen a lot more often than it does now, but it wasn't white hats.

539
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:50,712
Speaker 1: I can tell you that No It wasn't.

540
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:58,570
Speaker 1: basically all that did was cause the FBI and various Organizations to hunt down the people who made the viruses and piss a lot of people off.

541
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:02,470
Speaker 1: But the people who were angry didn't even try to secure themselves.

542
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,790
Speaker 1: They just did damage control and went right along doing what they were doing before.

543
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:21,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are banks that get hacked all the time But the banks will never say they were hacked nor who and we have no idea of knowing how much effort they put into actually Securing their fences because they would lose more money if people found out that they were insecure.

544
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,049
Speaker 0: Then they lose by people hacking into them.

545
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:36,922
Speaker 0: So your crazy idea of going around and Erasing everyone's hard drives with an actually evil virus is a crazy Very immature and childish idea granted.

546
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:39,150
Speaker 1: I had the same idea when I was 14.

547
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,634
Speaker 0: I also had the same idea when I was 14 and now that I'm 24 I no longer have this.

548
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:51,029
Speaker 1: I think part of the reason we don't have the idea anymore is that now we're business Professionals in our industry and we have to deal with that shit.

549
00:34:51,690 --> 00:35:02,790
Speaker 0: Even if I didn't have to deal with it, I would strongly advise against anyone actually making a horribly evil virus Although I am often puzzled as to why no one's done it.

550
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:14,018
Speaker 0: You'd think that with all these bad guys on the internet and with such Insecure systems everywhere with all these windows because the people who write the viruses aren't motivated by being hackers They're motivated by being paid by spammers.

551
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,628
Speaker 0: Yep, the people who are motivated by being hackers.

552
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:18,638
Speaker 0: nowadays They're not hacking.

553
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,970
Speaker 0: other people are causing harm to others.

554
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:26,270
Speaker 0: They're trying to increase benefits for themselves like getting rid of DRM and stuff like course.

555
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:33,210
Speaker 1: What if we took this idea, but instead of making it do something malicious, we made it pop up a window saying your computer is insecure.

556
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,530
Speaker 0: Because here's how to think because we're trying to teach people not to click on those sorts of things.

557
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:39,892
Speaker 1: Yeah.

558
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:40,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

559
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:40,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

560
00:35:40,654 --> 00:35:42,339
Speaker 1: This is the last one you should click on.

561
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:43,282
Speaker 0: Yep thoughts.

562
00:35:43,723 --> 00:35:44,606
Speaker 0: We gave you the thoughts.

563
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,632
Speaker 0: regards Christian All right.

564
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:47,455
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a cool one.

565
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:48,399
Speaker 1: Remember when I had jury duty.

566
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:50,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just listened to the podcast on jury duty.

567
00:35:51,393 --> 00:35:52,358
Speaker 1: I'll try to read this quickly.

568
00:35:52,378 --> 00:35:53,062
Speaker 1: It's kind of long.

569
00:35:53,243 --> 00:35:54,390
Speaker 0: Yeah funny thing happened to me.

570
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,877
Speaker 1: I was supposed to call an 800 number.

571
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:58,570
Speaker 1: go back in December to see if I will be selected for jury duty.

572
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:03,570
Speaker 1: I forgot and then I remember the following Monday I kind of it's kind of freaked out.

573
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,526
Speaker 1: My wife sent me a text message freaking out like something bad happened.

574
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:07,249
Speaker 1: realized what I did.

575
00:36:07,892 --> 00:36:09,740
Speaker 1: So I called the courthouse and told him I forgot.

576
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,784
Speaker 1: there was no big deal.

577
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:12,150
Speaker 1: They figured I'd forgotten.

578
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,390
Speaker 1: They'd already rescheduled it in March and if he gets elected to go, he'll report his experience to us.

579
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,097
Speaker 0: I'd like to hear that experience.

580
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:19,720
Speaker 1: a great show.

581
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,729
Speaker 0: if you forget again, I would like to hear that as well.

582
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is Steve from.

583
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:24,201
Speaker 1: he doesn't say where he's from.

584
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:26,070
Speaker 1: Not that it matters since this is the internet.

585
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,961
Speaker 1: We're all sovereign members of this nation.

586
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,370
Speaker 1: Yeah of the internet.

587
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:35,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone still send in jury duty stories if you have them because jury duty is cool.

588
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I gotta say it seems like I mean this guy had the same experience.

589
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,766
Speaker 1: The courts are doing their best to make jury duty.

590
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:47,737
Speaker 1: Okay for people I mean they could have you know, totally screwed you if you didn't show up But instead they did the right thing.

591
00:36:47,797 --> 00:36:49,464
Speaker 1: just obviously he forgot.

592
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:50,910
Speaker 1: Let's just reschedule him.

593
00:36:51,373 --> 00:37:01,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean no one would act, you know Anyone who's trying to get out of jury duty always tries to get out of it straight away, you know They'll say they'll call up and make an excuse or they'll show up and try to give a story.

594
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:09,765
Speaker 0: Someone who just doesn't show up most of the time like 90% of the time either something happened to them or they forgot and I think The court realizes that.

595
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:11,292
Speaker 0: All right.

596
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:12,798
Speaker 0: We got to pick another email here.

597
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,545
Speaker 1: I see a really long one.

598
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:15,468
Speaker 0: I see a short one.

599
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:15,870
Speaker 0: That's better.

600
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:19,619
Speaker 0: Did you guys hear the pen show about the moon landing?

601
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:20,763
Speaker 0: Here is a show.

602
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:23,050
Speaker 0: talk about the moon landing and why it is true.

603
00:37:23,412 --> 00:37:27,032
Speaker 0: Thanks for professionalism Brian Ps.

604
00:37:27,172 --> 00:37:29,943
Speaker 0: after hearing the professionalism show I want to party with you guys.

605
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:31,530
Speaker 1: Well, you should have come to katsu khan.

606
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:33,450
Speaker 0: Yes, you should have come to katsu khan.

607
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:36,321
Speaker 0: If you want to party with us You must come to a convention that we are at.

608
00:37:36,945 --> 00:37:46,422
Speaker 1: as for the moon landing I gotta say this one of my favorite moments in the history of the world is when some nut job Was bothering Buzz Aldrin about how he didn't really go to the moon.

609
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,566
Speaker 1: and it's all a conspiracy.

610
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,421
Speaker 1: and Buzz Aldrin Just punched the dude in the face.

611
00:37:50,783 --> 00:37:51,890
Speaker 0: That was an awesome time.

612
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,540
Speaker 1: That was the proper response to that kind of thing.

613
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:55,524
Speaker 0: to anyone out there.

614
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,910
Speaker 0: who's a crazy conspiracy nut?

615
00:37:57,051 --> 00:37:57,475
Speaker 0: Guess what?

616
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,169
Speaker 0: They landed on the moon.

617
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:06,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, and those markers on the backs of road signs don't direct the UN troops to the secret concentration camps.

618
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:11,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you take a powerful enough telescope, you can see shit on the moon.

619
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,716
Speaker 0: It we went there.

620
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:16,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's dust that we brought back from the moon.

621
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,292
Speaker 0: It's moon dust You.

622
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:22,185
Speaker 0: you won't find anything like it on earth except the stuff that we brought back from the moon.

623
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:23,630
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a fun one.

624
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:28,790
Speaker 1: Are you guys going to follow the match game 7x format six stars two contestants?

625
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,269
Speaker 1: I hope you have some good questions lined up for the show.

626
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,819
Speaker 1: I suggested you online polls for the audience.

627
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:35,063
Speaker 1: match blah blah blah blah.

628
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:35,726
Speaker 1: See you at.

629
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,890
Speaker 1: katsu khan, Jeremiah.

630
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:42,830
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm so happy that there are people out there who actually remember the match game and know anything about it.

631
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,471
Speaker 0: But there's actually a whole big segment of game show geeks out there Like you.

632
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:51,630
Speaker 0: don't know about them because they're kind of small and they're not really connected with each other.

633
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have a whole TV channel.

634
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:59,450
Speaker 1: They do all seem to agree the people out there that the match game in the 70s was one of the best game shows ever.

635
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:04,450
Speaker 1: Well, it's not so much in terms of fun and humor and watching it and being entertained.

636
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,190
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's really the trick with game shows as opposed to just games.

637
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:10,559
Speaker 0: Is that what makes a great game show?

638
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:16,403
Speaker 0: is that it is entertaining to watch it Even if you're not playing it, you know, I mean that's what sports are.

639
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:21,929
Speaker 0: game shows are sort of like Spectator games that aren't athletic in nature, you know.

640
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:30,550
Speaker 0: And what makes a good one is when it's entertaining and the match game seems to excel at entertaining the crowd Even if the actual game itself is just kind of random.

641
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:32,078
Speaker 0: All right.

642
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,995
Speaker 1: Oh Here's one.

643
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:34,397
Speaker 1: Here's one.

644
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,142
Speaker 1: I can keep reading them.

645
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:35,726
Speaker 0: You got him.

646
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,390
Speaker 1: All right, I got one.

647
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:36,893
Speaker 1: I like this.

648
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:44,810
Speaker 1: when you guys were discussing anime openers and closers You mentioned the Auriga themes from both Ghost in the Shell stand-alone complex seasons.

649
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:53,150
Speaker 1: Maybe you were speaking of anime in general But you talked about not understanding Japanese in an anime and enjoying a theme even though you don't understand the language.

650
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:56,510
Speaker 1: Just to clear up the Ghost in the Shell themes are in Russian.

651
00:39:56,951 --> 00:40:00,444
Speaker 1: I believe I love them so much that I hunted down the lyrics.

652
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:01,166
Speaker 1: I've included.

653
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:03,674
Speaker 1: I've included them here But we've all got work to do.

654
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,058
Speaker 1: He talks a bit more.

655
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,361
Speaker 1: why Vegeta?

656
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:09,450
Speaker 1: obviously not his real name unless his parents are totally awesome.

657
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:15,690
Speaker 1: Again, we are well aware that the music in the Ghost in the Shell things was Russian.

658
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,524
Speaker 1: We were just talking in general about the allure of hearing music in a language.

659
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:20,407
Speaker 1: You don't understand.

660
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:29,937
Speaker 0: Yes People often send us emails to tell us things like we didn't know or we got something wrong and most of the time they tell Us something we knew already.

661
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,552
Speaker 0: It's like people also send us links to things I get.

662
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:35,510
Speaker 0: how many emails are we not reading because they're just links to things.

663
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:38,282
Speaker 0: It's like if you're sending me a link, there's a 99% chance.

664
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:39,126
Speaker 0: I have seen that link.

665
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,999
Speaker 1: Well, are you the king of the internet?

666
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:51,588
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I read dig I read slash dot I have a lot of RSS feeds to gaming and gadget and nerd blogs and boing boing and all sorts of stuff.

667
00:40:52,010 --> 00:41:01,166
Speaker 0: if Something happens on the internet and there's something interesting to see the odds are that within 24 hours I will see it unless I am on vacation and not using a computer.

668
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:10,710
Speaker 0: So Send us a link if it's something really cool But before you send it to us check to make sure if it's already popular on dig or slash.

669
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,392
Speaker 0: Not even that.

670
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:13,118
Speaker 1: just look at our dig histories.

671
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:16,670
Speaker 1: or even better if you send us a link just send it to us in delicious.

672
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:20,244
Speaker 0: Yes, if you're not using de l that I see I owe us.

673
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,529
Speaker 0: you're not using the Internet's.

674
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:26,990
Speaker 1: granted I'm not as frumpy about this as Scott and I think it's cool when you guys send us links because it means that you're well.

675
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had to contribute to the show.

676
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,650
Speaker 1: I know I like not a captain grumpy pants here.

677
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:38,230
Speaker 0: Well, I do like getting any email whatsoever Even if it's just a link, but I am always sort of disappointed when I like ooh an email from a listener.

678
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:42,284
Speaker 0: Ooh, they sent a link and then I click on it and it's something I saw to a week ago.

679
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:45,262
Speaker 0: and then my oohs go Plus.

680
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:51,510
Speaker 1: in this case I can see why they thought Why people might have that because the way we phrase we kind of jumped from talking.

681
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,981
Speaker 0: I think we do make that mistake.

682
00:41:54,022 --> 00:42:01,414
Speaker 0: a lot is well, we'll phrase up We won't be so perfectly explicit and people will get the wrong idea about something We said and then hit us on it.

683
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:10,270
Speaker 1: or there's people like my co Scott here who when I said the guy who writes Dragon Ball But I didn't say his name Scott immediately assumes that I don't actually know the guy's name.

684
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,201
Speaker 0: Well, because I thought you didn't know the guy's name.

685
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:12,542
Speaker 0: cuz you.

686
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,830
Speaker 0: sometimes you'll pull that trick.

687
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:15,376
Speaker 1: When have I pulled that trick?

688
00:42:15,596 --> 00:42:19,150
Speaker 0: often when just cuz I can't remember a specific instance doesn't know.

689
00:42:20,072 --> 00:42:21,017
Speaker 1: So you're gonna read an email.

690
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:21,117
Speaker 1: cuz.

691
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:21,901
Speaker 1: I got another one here.

692
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:22,525
Speaker 0: I got one.

693
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:22,826
Speaker 0: All right.

694
00:42:22,866 --> 00:42:25,759
Speaker 0: All right I just listened to the podcast from eight three.

695
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,486
Speaker 0: Oh six dot dot dot dot.

696
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:28,390
Speaker 1: Which one was that?

697
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:29,670
Speaker 0: I'll tell you in a second.

698
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:34,290
Speaker 0: I want you to know that I just almost peed my pants laughing when the show came on.

699
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,520
Speaker 0: I thought hmm, maybe they will do it.

700
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,168
Speaker 0: then I thought dot dot dot.

701
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,902
Speaker 0: nah They will have someone in place of them.

702
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:41,626
Speaker 0: You didn't?

703
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:42,410
Speaker 0: it was awesome.

704
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:45,850
Speaker 0: If I had your address, I would mail you a box of kudos Steve.

705
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:49,802
Speaker 0: I think this Steve guy is going through the archives listening to stuff but a lot.

706
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:55,460
Speaker 1: actually it seems really interesting to me that Most of our new listeners are going through the archives.

707
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:57,770
Speaker 1: our old episodes are getting hammered.

708
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like you know, normally I would expect a graph of like episode downloads.

709
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:17,112
Speaker 0: I would expect the oldest episodes to be low on the graph and the newer episodes to be high on the graph like a big Diagonal line, but actually it's sort of like this horizontal line and the whole thing goes up sort of equally as people go through The archives.

710
00:43:17,192 --> 00:43:22,570
Speaker 0: now for me some podcasts I go through the archives like 12 Byzantine emperors got to go through the archives.

711
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I guess for me, it really depends on how much time I have how good the podcast is.

712
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,223
Speaker 1: I mean if a podcast is great.

713
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,030
Speaker 1: I love it.

714
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,958
Speaker 1: I'll go through the archives and like movies.

715
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:31,560
Speaker 1: you should see.

716
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,070
Speaker 1: I've listened to almost every show they've done at this point.

717
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, but other podcasts like Penn radio, you don't go through the archives, you know You pick out.

718
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:47,550
Speaker 0: obviously you do go through and pick out the choice Episodes from the archives, you know because there are some oldies but goodies, but you don't listen to everything.

719
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:49,095
Speaker 0: I mean what the hell.

720
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:55,016
Speaker 0: but yeah, if you want to listen to all our archives more power to you I don't recommend it.

721
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:57,708
Speaker 0: But if that's what you want to do, you're crazy.

722
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:04,727
Speaker 0: Awesome All right, let's see, yeah, so that episode 8306 that was the last one we did before Otacon.

723
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:05,850
Speaker 0: that was special number.

724
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:09,305
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, oh special number six or seven.

725
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:11,374
Speaker 0: I think it was number four I don't remember.

726
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:12,098
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

727
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:18,986
Speaker 0: but yeah, basically when we went to Otacon We said that we were trying to get other people to do the episodes for us and we did.

728
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:21,837
Speaker 1: but yeah It was actually two of the movies.

729
00:44:21,857 --> 00:44:22,600
Speaker 1: You should see people.

730
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:22,941
Speaker 1: Yep.

731
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:32,970
Speaker 0: They did it on the Monday, but The day before we on the Thursday when we left for Otacon We put up a short episode and if you want you can go into our archives.

732
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:38,588
Speaker 0: This will teach you how to go into our archives and listen to the 8306 episode and you'll see it's.

733
00:44:38,688 --> 00:44:39,230
Speaker 0: it's pretty funny.

734
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:40,508
Speaker 0: I think at least one guy left.

735
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:45,950
Speaker 1: All right, we should probably end this since it's Thursday and I'm tired and we got to go to a con tomorrow.

736
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,956
Speaker 0: Do you want to do one more?

737
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:47,379
Speaker 0: and that's it?

738
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do one more.

739
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,210
Speaker 1: I won't read this whole thing.

740
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,835
Speaker 1: It's really long.

741
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,610
Speaker 1: But thanks to Frankie G for the email.

742
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:55,630
Speaker 1: I know you've heard it a thousand times now, but thanks for putting on a fun show.

743
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,466
Speaker 1: I wanted to thank you guys for turning me on to Carcassonne.

744
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:00,876
Speaker 0: Oh Carcassonne is a good board.

745
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:02,445
Speaker 1: got to play it for the first time last night.

746
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,190
Speaker 1: We all had a good time.

747
00:45:03,591 --> 00:45:07,827
Speaker 1: I won the first game and they did a little king making to keep me from winning the second game.

748
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:11,107
Speaker 1: the bastards You have a good set of friends if they're smart enough to do that.

749
00:45:12,131 --> 00:45:13,979
Speaker 1: So which expansions are worth getting?

750
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:16,390
Speaker 1: and you guys like playing with or without the river?

751
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:19,198
Speaker 0: Okay, we talked about this and split that up into two.

752
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:23,010
Speaker 1: yeah the river in my opinion is a bit shit.

753
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also I'm not a fan of the river.

754
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:32,962
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess it could be good to teach people how to play but it really just kind of ruins the game Especially if you play against me.

755
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:33,869
Speaker 1: captain farm.

756
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really see a point in the river.

757
00:45:36,972 --> 00:45:46,690
Speaker 0: all it seems to do is force people to put down some farmers early and Then go on with the game as usual just starting the game out normally without the river.

758
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:53,652
Speaker 0: It seems to be just fine and concentrates a lot more on the core mechanic without throwing this kind of wacky river in the middle Of things.

759
00:45:53,813 --> 00:45:56,365
Speaker 1: wacky wavy inflatable arm-flailing river man.

760
00:45:56,828 --> 00:45:57,250
Speaker 0: as for what?

761
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,013
Speaker 0: Expansions?

762
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:00,297
Speaker 0: it kind of depends what you want.

763
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:01,381
Speaker 1: They're mostly crap.

764
00:46:01,722 --> 00:46:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of the expansions are gimmicky and Just kind of cute like the princess and the dragon.

765
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:08,629
Speaker 0: if you want a wooden dragon go get it.

766
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,190
Speaker 1: Well, I mean all we really play with now are the one that adds the inns and the cathedrals.

767
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,324
Speaker 0: It's called ins and cathedrals.

768
00:46:14,445 --> 00:46:17,821
Speaker 1: Haha And we bought the tower.

769
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:22,750
Speaker 1: we don't play with the tower We just I just bought it so I'd have the tower to put all the tiles in while we play.

770
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:30,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually my number one recommendation to you if you want to play Carcassonne with expansions is The game is pretty cheap.

771
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:36,833
Speaker 0: the ins and cathedrals are pretty good and you probably want that set because it gets a lot of tiles that the normal set doesn't Have.

772
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:38,689
Speaker 0: that makes the game a little better.

773
00:46:39,472 --> 00:46:45,110
Speaker 0: But and also the greatest expansion to Carcassonne is another set of Carcassonne.

774
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,699
Speaker 1: However, be wary if you add another set to Carcassonne.

775
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:56,790
Speaker 1: the more sets you add the more important farming becomes and the more powerful Certain moves become and the game becomes unbalanced very quickly.

776
00:46:56,812 --> 00:47:09,340
Speaker 0: Yes the game will also take a lot longer and you need to figure out how many meeples you're gonna give to people because when the Game is longer and there are more tiles You need more meeples or maybe you just have to manage the meeples you have more carefully.

777
00:47:09,741 --> 00:47:13,772
Speaker 0: But I think it definitely makes it a more exciting game for experienced players.

778
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:14,374
Speaker 1: Yes.

779
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:16,560
Speaker 1: Now, uh, he has another whole half.

780
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,504
Speaker 1: It's not gonna read the whole thing.

781
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:20,277
Speaker 1: I'm gonna paraphrase here, but out of the Trigon podcast.

782
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:25,260
Speaker 1: just for the record I do like and I've owned the series on DVD many Trevor on the Sun blah blah.

783
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:27,729
Speaker 1: I hope you received some feedback.

784
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,740
Speaker 1: damn you guys really downplayed Nishimura Satoshi.

785
00:47:31,202 --> 00:47:32,647
Speaker 1: Well, he hasn't done all that much.

786
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:34,534
Speaker 1: he did go on to direct Hajime.

787
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:37,564
Speaker 1: no motherfucking epo Aka fighting.

788
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:42,739
Speaker 1: motherfucking spirit a show I find superior and probably every way to try gun.

789
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:45,040
Speaker 1: now I haven't actually seen this show yet.

790
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:51,809
Speaker 1: Daryl Surratt and anime world order and you have talked it up to and Dave and Joel and Dave and Joel and we got a Couple other emails about it.

791
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,139
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it.

792
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:58,944
Speaker 1: All I have to say is that if you're saying this is better than try gun and all of try gun That's a really heady claim.

793
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:00,470
Speaker 0: That's that's pretty heavy right?

794
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,075
Speaker 0: We're gonna watch Hajime.

795
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:03,320
Speaker 1: no motherfucking epo.

796
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't it a sports anime about boxing something like that?

797
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I like boxing.

798
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:09,443
Speaker 1: but I mean, uh What was that movie?

799
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:11,569
Speaker 1: We watch the one with Clint Eastwood in it.

800
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:17,830
Speaker 1: I don't remember whatever the bud million-dollar, baby Yep, a rocky or anything like that.

801
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:18,472
Speaker 1: I like boxing.

802
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:19,877
Speaker 0: You never saw the first rocky movie.

803
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:25,696
Speaker 1: you said no I never saw any of the rest of the rocky movies and I never saw the first rocky movie in one go.

804
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:26,338
Speaker 0: Okay.

805
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:26,740
Speaker 0: All right.

806
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:32,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, I Think try gun might be better, but I haven't seen this show.

807
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,579
Speaker 1: So I can't really say but if this show is better than try gun, it's gonna be in my top five.

808
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that you're you're.

809
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:40,940
Speaker 0: you got a big heavy claim here.

810
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,668
Speaker 0: We'll see if you can live up to better than try.

811
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:46,912
Speaker 1: gun puts it right up there with cowboy bebop eska flown And I know Dave and Joel will hate me.

812
00:48:46,973 --> 00:48:53,280
Speaker 1: but Evangelion Yeah, which as much as I agree with you on every one of your points, you can't deny that Ava was a well-done show.

813
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,310
Speaker 0: Actually, I think I want to do one more email and that's it.

814
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:58,358
Speaker 0: I was actually from some people I want to.

815
00:48:58,479 --> 00:48:59,141
Speaker 0: I want to Mention.

816
00:48:59,723 --> 00:49:02,875
Speaker 0: so you remember we did that interview with Luke crane and such.

817
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:04,320
Speaker 1: Ah, that was awesome.

818
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:11,500
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, he mentioned some people in the podcast in in that interview and then those people finally found out about it and contacted us.

819
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,128
Speaker 1: Well, I'll talk about a roundabout.

820
00:49:13,148 --> 00:49:14,253
Speaker 0: I know right.

821
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:16,664
Speaker 0: so he says gentlemen I'm writing.

822
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:20,840
Speaker 0: I am the writing half of the team that produces the dire destiny webcomic.

823
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:24,577
Speaker 0: I recently happened upon your podcast interview with Luke crane from October son.

824
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:34,200
Speaker 0: Oh six Thereabouts a burning wheel and ubercon 8. it was well worth least it listening to as I got to hear either Luke or Tor Describe dire destiny as really freaking awesome.

825
00:49:34,882 --> 00:49:43,968
Speaker 0: I'm always looking to promote the site even though we're in a bit of a lull right now and on top of that We're releasing a D&D three and a half Adventure sometime in the next couple of months.

826
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:52,000
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know if either of you have seen dire destiny But if you have and if you need grist for your show, I'd be happy to make myself available for an interview.

827
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:58,480
Speaker 0: I'm in Virginia and the artist mikkelage is in Poland, but maybe we can work something up over the net with Skype or something.

828
00:49:58,943 --> 00:50:00,492
Speaker 0: Thanks for your time Robert.

829
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,208
Speaker 0: Ah A webcomic that I am NOT reading yet.

830
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:05,894
Speaker 0: The person is a fan of our show.

831
00:50:06,134 --> 00:50:07,820
Speaker 0: perhaps we should read their webcomic.

832
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, we also got to start reading Apple Geeks.

833
00:50:10,373 --> 00:50:11,620
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm gonna read Apple Geeks.

834
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,001
Speaker 0: We'll see.

835
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:16,379
Speaker 1: I'll probably like every time someone tells me to read a webcomic and I actually do I end up liking it.

836
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:20,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, so I guess anyone out there looking for a new webcomic.

837
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:25,713
Speaker 0: Dire destiny seems to have cool people who know how to spell and punctuate.

838
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:29,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a well-formed email Even though he didn't capitalize Skype.

839
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:30,763
Speaker 0: Yep.

840
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:32,490
Speaker 1: Oh, that's okay.

841
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:42,207
Speaker 0: Cuz Skype is becoming a generalized term It's true, but his email was better written than pretty much every other email I have here and His webcomic may or may not be cool.

842
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:45,980
Speaker 0: And since the guy likes D&D and burning wheel.

843
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:50,500
Speaker 0: He's probably a cool guy and thus it is likely that his webcomic is cool.

844
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:56,409
Speaker 1: So anyway, we mostly did this episode to prove to you all that yes We read the email we get.

845
00:50:56,832 --> 00:51:02,800
Speaker 1: you can keep sending it to us But we're not gonna read it in every episode because that doesn't seem to be what you guys want.

846
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,599
Speaker 1: Of course if that's changed let us know.

847
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:09,862
Speaker 0: Yes, you also this episode because we are lazy and we do not want to come up with some other idea of something to talk About.

848
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:12,800
Speaker 1: yes, I'm ready to play Phoenix Wright until I fall asleep.

849
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,933
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't realize the hardest part about geek nights is coming up with what to talking.

850
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:19,120
Speaker 0: talk about not actually doing the talking.

851
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do more pre-production than post-production these days.

852
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:24,680
Speaker 0: Oh, well, the show is easy and now it's over.

853
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:30,539
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll see you Monday when we're probably gonna talk about how net works since a lot of people have a lot of trouble with it.

854
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:33,472
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't even understand what the hell net is.

855
00:51:33,492 --> 00:51:45,140
Speaker 1: if you're a new listener and you're not so up on tech I'd recommend you check out our recent Monday episode on networking for layman's Yep, and then you will be much better prepared to understand the next show on net?

856
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:48,598
Speaker 1: Yes, but it will definitely be at that same level of technical whatnot.

857
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:52,119
Speaker 1: So it's not gonna be some sort of doctoral thesis here.

858
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,975
Speaker 0: We should make it a doctoral thesis then say we're doing it at layman's level and see what people say.

859
00:51:57,196 --> 00:52:00,939
Speaker 1: God start talking about algorithms for assigning IP addresses based on.

860
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:10,116
Speaker 1: Okay, this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

861
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:12,260
