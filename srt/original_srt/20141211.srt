1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,684
Speaker 0: It's Thursday December 11th 2014.

2
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:14,207
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:18,277
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight buses.

4
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,398
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,283
Speaker 0: It was either that or torture, and you probably didn't want to hear us to talk about torture.

6
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:37,178
Speaker 0: It would be torturous, so I Explained this to Scott a while ago, and and a thing happened.

7
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:52,255
Speaker 0: this happened many times over the years where Scott asked a question and I Start answering, and I say a bunch of things and then later Scott acts like I never actually told him what the answer to that question was Definitely what I said.

8
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,164
Speaker 1: you were definitely saying something you said.

9
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,490
Speaker 1: I knew you were saying some words.

10
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:56,670
Speaker 1: I just not listening to them.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,009
Speaker 0: You said what are you doing over there, and I explained in detail what I was doing over there.

12
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,789
Speaker 0: So what do you think I was doing in the hallway?

13
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,737
Speaker 1: peeing on the floor?

14
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:08,374
Speaker 0: yeah, so Basically what happened?

15
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:14,440
Speaker 0: we had some nice rugs that we used for the rabbits to run out in the hallway And there were nice rugs, and they worked fine.

16
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,390
Speaker 1: all right the rugs you talked about yesterday.

17
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:22,150
Speaker 0: I talked about them today because you asked me what I was doing and I assumed that you hadn't listened to me yesterday.

18
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:23,216
Speaker 1: No, I didn't listen.

19
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,469
Speaker 1: I didn't listen to you today is what I didn't listen.

20
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:32,269
Speaker 0: So we got these rugs, and I went to pick one up because it was kind of dirty And I vacuumed in it didn't quite clean it enough.

21
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:36,290
Speaker 0: So I just thought I'm just gonna pick it up and take it out and shake it on the balcony.

22
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,509
Speaker 0: I go to pick it up, and it's stuck to the floor.

23
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,655
Speaker 0: so I Investigate a little bit.

24
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:52,770
Speaker 0: It looks like the latex and other things backing on the rug Has just fucking rotted away and kind of fused to the hardwood, and it was a giant mess.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,273
Speaker 1: Well didn't you know?

26
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,981
Speaker 1: that's one of those auto-adhesive rugs.

27
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,670
Speaker 1: it turns into a carpet for free now.

28
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,314
Speaker 0: so I Put it back.

29
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:11,387
Speaker 0: so I threw it away, and then I proceeded to try to figure out how to remove this Residue from my floor without paying anyone a lot of money.

30
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,459
Speaker 0: alcohol Yeah, no alcohol has no effect.

31
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:33,507
Speaker 0: I tried a number of different solvents and There here's what works best number one water Okay, number two which is actually a much better solvent and works super well Benzene which I'm not going to use because we know better now as humans not to fuck around with benzene.

32
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,229
Speaker 1: a dish soap.

33
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:35,408
Speaker 0: Nope, no effect.

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,850
Speaker 0: Ammonia of any none of those things any effect, but apparently turpentine is also super effective.

35
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:45,950
Speaker 1: How about your face just like get down really near and lick it and bite it and?

36
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:52,186
Speaker 1: It's not the worst solution, so it'll work slowly, but get the job toothbrush.

37
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:56,929
Speaker 0: so basically There's two rugs the other larger rug.

38
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:04,172
Speaker 0: I Have chosen not to deal with that for the time being and was leaving that rug where it is and the rug that already pulled Up.

39
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:13,230
Speaker 0: I've spent the last few days with up with water and A putty knife and a whole bunch of elbow grease.

40
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:14,587
Speaker 0: fucking sucks.

41
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:20,125
Speaker 0: However the good news is there's a chance that actually our renters insurance covers it.

42
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:30,729
Speaker 0: so if they do I'm Probably just still gonna deal with it myself And then we'll just make a claim based on the cost of the remediation and see if we can just get a bunch of money

43
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:31,552
Speaker 1: Mmm,

44
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,108
Speaker 0: or maybe I'll hire someone to do the second half of it.

45
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,829
Speaker 1: I just didn't get rugs and scratched up my floor instead.

46
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,483
Speaker 1: that won't matter until I move out in which case they'll probably just be Like we're keeping your security deposit like fine I don't give a fuck.

47
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:48,120
Speaker 0: you have the New York City our rug claws in your lease, or is it just our lease?

48
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,883
Speaker 1: I think I do.

49
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,380
Speaker 0: yeah a lot of New York leases a little insight into what it's like to live in, New York.

50
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:55,529
Speaker 0: They basically have this clause in most New York leases.

51
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:05,418
Speaker 0: that says something like 80% of the non bathroom Floorage in your apartment must be covered by carpets that are at least like 0.5 centimeters thick mm-hmm.

52
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:09,019
Speaker 0: The actual reason that's there so that they want to kick you out.

53
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:17,240
Speaker 0: They can go up and be like look They didn't cover their floor, and we warn them and they still haven't bought enough rugs to cover their floor.

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,726
Speaker 1: Why did I?

55
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:18,738
Speaker 1: why did I buy this?

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,252
Speaker 1: Apartment with such a nice floor?

57
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:23,110
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna cover it up Why did I buy this table?

58
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,920
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna cover it up with a tablecloth?

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,800
Speaker 0: It's kind of well.

60
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:29,880
Speaker 0: I only cover things with the tablecloth because the tablecloth is really nice to use when you're playing a board game.

61
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,574
Speaker 1: I cover things in the tablecloth because if there's gonna be like a huge mess.

62
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:39,218
Speaker 1: I'm not about protecting the table I'm about cleaning it up in two seconds by just throwing away the tablecloth away.

63
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,412
Speaker 0: Paper tablecloth you just take a fabric one just throw it in the washing machine.

64
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,355
Speaker 1: same deal all good.

65
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:51,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine same deal Yeah, so uh got any news Cap'n I do have a news.

66
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:58,611
Speaker 1: so yet again for like the fifth time in our lives Ye Pirate Bay is let down.

67
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,399
Speaker 0: however this time it might be the end.

68
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:02,539
Speaker 1: I mean it could always be the end.

69
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,635
Speaker 0: well No like one of the founders something else will come out.

70
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:10,220
Speaker 0: one of the founders I just got out of jail the one he basically said yeah, it was only intended to last ten years.

71
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:18,971
Speaker 0: The Pirate Bay has increasingly been funded by increasingly abhorrent ads So much more important than I could have ever imagined they would be.

72
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:21,640
Speaker 0: yeah that we need a new paradigm.

73
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:27,160
Speaker 0: So fuck it next generation pirate away in a new fashion, and we'll pirate away in a new fashion.

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,005
Speaker 1: No problem however.

75
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:33,412
Speaker 0: This is this inconvenience me in the short term because Most of the shows I'm watching ain't that?

76
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:33,633
Speaker 0: the?

77
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,180
Speaker 0: the pay for HBO thing?

78
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,060
Speaker 0: Still isn't actually available yet, so I really can't watch a lot of the things I watch except on the Pirate Bay.

79
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,391
Speaker 1: I mean I just need a new place to get torrents from.

80
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,020
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's plenty of them.

81
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,783
Speaker 0: Torrance of what.

82
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,509
Speaker 0: what are you even watching a bit time?

83
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,119
Speaker 0: Yeah adventure time South Park South Park?

84
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,302
Speaker 1: That's the only things.

85
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:54,072
Speaker 0: really is Pirate Bay for the amazing world of gumball?

86
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,638
Speaker 1: don't watch that you really should.

87
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:55,999
Speaker 0: that's it.

88
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,629
Speaker 0: I love that show is actually one of my favorite cartoons now.

89
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, though Rick and Morty you can actually watch for free at least Whatever.

90
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,274
Speaker 0: I can't believe you haven't watched Rick and Morty either.

91
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,500
Speaker 1: How much y'all pedal have you watch?

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,487
Speaker 1: 12 episodes shut up.

93
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,415
Speaker 0: how much Sailor Moon Crystal have you watched?

94
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:12,460
Speaker 1: one episode?

95
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:16,308
Speaker 0: Ah How much Breaking Bad did you watch.

96
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:19,959
Speaker 0: zero Game of Thrones zero all right all right?

97
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,695
Speaker 1: Daily show I watched like the clips when someone links to it John Oliver.

98
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:25,899
Speaker 1: They're all same.

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,535
Speaker 0: oh Crash Course none really really.

100
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:35,067
Speaker 0: you haven't watched Crash Course It's you know that chemistry show you like.

101
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:36,473
Speaker 0: take that make it a hundred times better.

102
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,738
Speaker 0: and about things you actually care about.

103
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:42,970
Speaker 0: I care about chemistry a lot, I think you'll care about the Mongols and Such much more.

104
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,159
Speaker 1: are they breaking down my shitty wall?

105
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,902
Speaker 0: But yeah the Italy.

106
00:06:48,922 --> 00:07:02,006
Speaker 0: interesting to see what comes out of this because the one thing that the Pirate Bay did not do you know every iteration of Getting information to places for free in a way that doesn't require trust and direct knowledge.

107
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:02,408
Speaker 0: like you know.

108
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:20,700
Speaker 0: you can trust and direct knowledge with IRC if you want, but Basically every way has been has had like one Fatal flaw and we fixed fatal flaws along the way, but right now the fatal flaw of current torrents Is that there has to be a place where you find the tracker?

109
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:26,355
Speaker 0: So what we really need is the distributed tracker system.

110
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:31,472
Speaker 0: We do sort of have that that exists Yeah, but how do you get to the the entry point to a tracker?

111
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,980
Speaker 1: you have to you know figure it out?

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,503
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of people talking about making a tour basically a torrent web browser Which is the future.

113
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:45,398
Speaker 0: some smart person will make that unless the drink-or-die spirit is good and truly dead.

114
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:49,658
Speaker 0: hmm Yeah, so I don't think the Pirate Bay is going to bet on it.

115
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:51,857
Speaker 0: You want to bet if it's gonna come back?

116
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,630
Speaker 1: So here's the thing that's really interesting about how it went down.

117
00:07:56,112 --> 00:08:01,413
Speaker 1: so the Pirate Bay claimed That it was up in so many places that were all secret.

118
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:01,835
Speaker 1: that you did.

119
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,535
Speaker 0: it would never be able to be taken But as far as I can gather is pretty much just up in Sweden.

120
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:15,080
Speaker 1: Yeah Secondly I Remember a rumor happening a long time ago that sounded pretty plausible right in that in Sweden similarly to the u.s.

121
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,994
Speaker 1: The people in the legislative branch like can't be like.

122
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,520
Speaker 1: if you're a congressperson in the u.s.

123
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,531
Speaker 1: You can't really be charged with crimes you commit in the Congress right.

124
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:28,022
Speaker 1: so it's like if you're just lighting up some meth in The Capitol.

125
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:30,931
Speaker 1: they can't do anything about it.

126
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,455
Speaker 1: so similar thing in Sweden.

127
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:41,020
Speaker 1: There was a rumor that hey They'll just set up the Pirate Bay like in Swedish government building which would have been brilliant, and they wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

128
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,332
Speaker 0: but no apparently it was in a data center in NACA.

129
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,740
Speaker 1: yeah that the the.

130
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:51,660
Speaker 1: When the news first came out they were like they they won't say where they went to go and take down the server.

131
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,531
Speaker 1: So I was like oh, maybe it was the Swedish government thing.

132
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,020
Speaker 1: yeah, but it wasn't.

133
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,733
Speaker 0: Apparently a Super Bay is down as well as is BAM.

134
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, well they were all running your lead.

135
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, so BAM your leading site for digimon porn is finally gone.

136
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,170
Speaker 1: I mean imger really don't means you don't need BAM.

137
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, BAM was never actually useful from day one.

138
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,040
Speaker 0: It was just digimon.

139
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,389
Speaker 1: It would have been useful if imger did not exist.

140
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,273
Speaker 1: it would have taken would have been.

141
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:18,060
Speaker 0: no because even then it was nothing.

142
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,009
Speaker 0: But digimon porn it was hard to use doesn't matter.

143
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:21,230
Speaker 1: well.

144
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,168
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if what imger isn't about what's on there It's about you.

145
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,080
Speaker 1: use it for yourself.

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,015
Speaker 0: Yes, but imger was easy to use and it wasn't just a haven of digimon.

147
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,219
Speaker 1: maybe if more people use BAM.

148
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:37,518
Speaker 1: And because imger didn't exist a non-digimon porn fashion You're just obsessed with digimon porn.

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,520
Speaker 0: Go find the episode of geek nights where we talked about BAM when it first came into existence because we're I sort of forgot it existed.

150
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:44,324
Speaker 1: So they mentioned that.

151
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:50,659
Speaker 0: yeah, so did I because in that episode live I was like ooh This will be a way to destroy and I clicked on it live in the show.

152
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:58,734
Speaker 0: And if you and I'm pretty sure it was nothing, but digimon porn and I was like I gassed at this Yeah, and then we just talked about that for a while.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,080
Speaker 0: Oh Pirate Bay you will either be back or Pirate Bay had the longest run of any of these things ever.

154
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:13,820
Speaker 1: the one thing about Pirate Bay That I will miss if it doesn't come back is that they would promote good things on the home page.

155
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,960
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's how I found that this is what happens when you call the police music video.

156
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,622
Speaker 0: That's right.

157
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:25,008
Speaker 1: They live in lately like the front page of the Pirate Bay like promoted things that you know, we're good and then you know, we're.

158
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,084
Speaker 1: it was like basically the thing of the day of Awesomeness, yeah, here we go.

159
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,789
Speaker 0: Peter Peter Sunday the pirate.

160
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,762
Speaker 1: He's the guy who just got out of jail should stay down Yep.

161
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:37,913
Speaker 1: Well, I mean he's basically like he's definitely quote.

162
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,842
Speaker 0: the Pirate Bay has been raided again Again.

163
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,447
Speaker 0: that happened over eight years ago.

164
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,029
Speaker 0: last time.

165
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,098
Speaker 0: that time a lot of people went out to protests and rally in the streets.

166
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,419
Speaker 0: today Few seem to care and I'm one of them.

167
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:53,591
Speaker 0: The site was ugly full of bugs old code and old designs.

168
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,159
Speaker 0: it never changed except for one thing the ads.

169
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:06,140
Speaker 0: More and more ads were filling the site and somehow when it felt unimaginable to make those ads more distasteful They somehow ended up even worse.

170
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:12,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who was running the Pirate Bay or how they got a hold of it But the people originally made it like Peter here.

171
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,814
Speaker 1: They didn't cover it in ads.

172
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,520
Speaker 1: They were doing it for the sake of pirating.

173
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:22,220
Speaker 1: So, I don't know how these other people came to possess it, but they definitely were in it for the money.

174
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:25,640
Speaker 0: Maybe therefore maybe the reason it was so resilient.

175
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 0: You could use that money to fund a lot of different data centers and servers and shit.

176
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,175
Speaker 1: Maybe hard to say I don't know.

177
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,220
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah, maybe they just needed the money and they were to fund to keep it up and they were desperate.

178
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:44,611
Speaker 0: So we either need distributed torrents or any data centers on Satellites and on barges in international waters.

179
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:48,479
Speaker 1: Let's just code it ourselves or let's set up waste rewrite waste.

180
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,429
Speaker 0: Someone's gonna have to rewrite waste.

181
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,020
Speaker 1: if we why don't we get the guy who wrote waste the win amp guy?

182
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,824
Speaker 1: What's his name?

183
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,080
Speaker 0: Why don't we actually I actually forgot his name?

184
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,200
Speaker 0: So I feel really bad and dumb about that because he's one of the more important people in the history of the modern internet.

185
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,522
Speaker 1: Yeah Call him up.

186
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:06,769
Speaker 0: No soft guy.

187
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:09,296
Speaker 0: I'm just searching for null soft guy Justin Frankel.

188
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:09,898
Speaker 1: That's the guy.

189
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,540
Speaker 0: that is the guy.

190
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,384
Speaker 1: How do we call him up?

191
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:14,035
Speaker 0: I'm glad that null soft guy as a search actually turns it up.

192
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:14,437
Speaker 0: Yes.

193
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:14,859
Speaker 0: Yes.

194
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:25,554
Speaker 0: So in other news There's a bunch of news around the same topic and I don't want to cover all the ground We've covered on this before so I'm gonna skip a lot of things.

195
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:29,255
Speaker 0: I would normally say here So Scott, you don't need to be like ah this again.

196
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:42,519
Speaker 0: So one there's a new extension a Modern one for browsers that doesn't just block ads it clicks on them a random Percentage of the time and also acts like it downloaded all of them.

197
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:48,980
Speaker 1: So to cost the people buying the ads money up and to make money for the people who are hosting the ads.

198
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,786
Speaker 1: So you visit a website they get money.

199
00:12:50,806 --> 00:13:08,932
Speaker 0: It also hides the fact that you're running ad blocking software because some sites now like disable functionality if you're blocking ads and Because it clicks randomly it removes or reduces the value of the data Generated from the ad clicks because it fills them with random shit.

200
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:11,460
Speaker 0: It looks like it'll even like fill out forms with random garbage.

201
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,990
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's interesting and a lot of people are mad about it.

202
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:22,239
Speaker 0: independently a bunch of French publishers are filing lawsuits against adblock plus.

203
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:28,160
Speaker 0: Um, you know the grounds the fraud and all the kinds of stupid fraud.

204
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are they committing?

205
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,456
Speaker 1: The growing rejection promise to block ads and we block them.

206
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,280
Speaker 1: fraud.

207
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:41,393
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that blocking ads while looking at websites is itself fraud.

208
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,100
Speaker 0: your steal, you know the same bullshit argument that just failed.

209
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,820
Speaker 1: I mean that could be described as many things but fraud is not one of those things.

210
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,429
Speaker 1: It could be described as accurately.

211
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,239
Speaker 0: so neither of these things is new.

212
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:55,080
Speaker 0: You guys may not pay attention because you just run adblock and don't think about it.

213
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:58,374
Speaker 0: Or I know people who are young who don't run adblock.

214
00:13:58,394 --> 00:13:59,660
Speaker 0: I don't know how you fucking use the internet.

215
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:00,986
Speaker 1: I definitely don't know how to use it.

216
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,858
Speaker 0: Like I've seen what the internet looks like without an adblock.

217
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:04,782
Speaker 1: It's bad It's.

218
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,791
Speaker 0: I would not use it if it looked like.

219
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:14,360
Speaker 0: well not not the internet the World Wide Web Yes to be fair to be do you talk about this stuff correctly, but none of this is new.

220
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,470
Speaker 0: I mean I was running ad blocking software when I had a modem.

221
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,656
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I was also you.

222
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:30,820
Speaker 0: well anyway, so Coupled with all this somehow the advertising industries still make a shit ton of money with online ads, of course.

223
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:37,562
Speaker 1: So same way that spammers made a shit ton of money even though they were sending like Viagra Viagra Viagra Somehow.

224
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:38,184
Speaker 1: that makes money.

225
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:55,731
Speaker 0: So there are stupid people who click on ads and buy things from ads and There are also people who aren't stupid But they click on ads to give money to the person probably who runs the website they like and they're just stealing money effectively From the person who's you know, actually bought the ad.

226
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:56,113
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

227
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,160
Speaker 0: That whole ecosystem is not changed in forever.

228
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:06,140
Speaker 0: But There's an article a couple articles that have come out recently that have done some investigative journalism and kind of pointed the same thing.

229
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:22,520
Speaker 0: It is likely that the majority of ad clicks at least in the modern internet are pretty much entirely from Organized crime run ad clicking networks that are part of giant global money laundering schemes.

230
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,655
Speaker 0: Because ad clicks, you know what this is like in the old days.

231
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,665
Speaker 0: if you wanted to launder money What's the most effective way to do it?

232
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:37,469
Speaker 1: Unless you're already rich and in the government open a business and then have legitimate Purchases on record for that business.

233
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,600
Speaker 1: Okay, like I need to launder a thousand dollars.

234
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:49,534
Speaker 1: Well this barber shop I set up that no one ever seems to come in Had like a hundred haircuts for ten bucks each thousand dollars laundered.

235
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,420
Speaker 1: all good the barber shop.

236
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:55,373
Speaker 0: That's the reason why especially in the 60s 70s and 80s.

237
00:15:55,634 --> 00:16:01,319
Speaker 0: There were so many barber shops That somehow managed to stay open in the shittiest parts of town.

238
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,980
Speaker 1: But this liquor store just managed to sell so much goddamn liquor.

239
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,428
Speaker 0: Well liquor is hard because it's a physical commodity you're selling.

240
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:16,615
Speaker 0: the point is it's a business where there is no real way to Prove whether or not you're doing business other than a stakeout.

241
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:17,098
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

242
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:27,382
Speaker 0: So in the modern world You don't need a barbershop because there are two things that are ready-made to launder money and there's basically no way to ever get Caught.

243
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,873
Speaker 0: number one ads online.

244
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:30,295
Speaker 1: Yep.

245
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:35,807
Speaker 0: Number two DLC in Shitty video games.

246
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,092
Speaker 1: Ah, that's a good one.

247
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:44,100
Speaker 0: If I was going to launder money today I would make a free-to-play game that was garbage but had people playing don't care if it makes money or not.

248
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:52,208
Speaker 0: People who needed to launder money would basically buy cards with cash or whatever They would do to buy items in the game.

249
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,545
Speaker 0: My game company has nothing but clean money Except apples taking a cut.

250
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:05,665
Speaker 0: Oh, no apples taking a small percentage of my illegal free money To turn it legal.

251
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that that is a good plan.

252
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,806
Speaker 1: That would probably work for I think it's happening.

253
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,659
Speaker 0: I think it is a huge part of the freemium gaming industry.

254
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,059
Speaker 1: Sure I'm dead serious, but at the same time If you did that it, you know.

255
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,520
Speaker 1: The one thing that our justice system is actually very good at is going after mafias.

256
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,866
Speaker 1: That's like their special move.

257
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,960
Speaker 0: They just arrested another Gambino in New York like today.

258
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, all of the laws that we have like RICO Act, etc, etc.

259
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:36,900
Speaker 1: We're all originally designed to go after organized crimes, right?

260
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,346
Speaker 1: Which is why they're also good at going against gang because those are organized crimes and they're really bad at going against Unorganized things like anonymous.

261
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:53,732
Speaker 0: Well, yeah today looks like today 30 FBI agents and Italian authorities and Interpol Rated a New York apartment and caught one of the last free Gambino under bosses.

262
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,033
Speaker 0: Sure.

263
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,457
Speaker 0: That's how these look.

264
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:56,099
Speaker 0: It's counter-strike.

265
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,580
Speaker 1: Anyway, right, but that's like the thing that they are ridiculously good at because they were designed to do that.

266
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,356
Speaker 1: However, so that's why anything that they do that doesn't fit that they usually try to be like.

267
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:18,560
Speaker 1: there's a leader here Who's you know, they try to you know, make it so that there is some sort of organization or conspiracy or something.

268
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:27,535
Speaker 0: However, they can use their anti-mafia technology by doing this with gaming technology like DLC and in-app purchases and things like that.

269
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:37,404
Speaker 0: Technology makes it almost impossible to prove malfeasance because you are actually literally selling real things that are a legitimate Economy on their own.

270
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:46,740
Speaker 0: So it's almost as like you have a store or a factory that for free is Making things that you're actually selling for real money except that factory doesn't cost you anything to run.

271
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:55,320
Speaker 0: So it's free money laundering The tech and with encryption and deniability this makes it an order of magnitude easier to launder.

272
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,168
Speaker 1: Listen laundering money was never the problem.

273
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:59,116
Speaker 1: getting the money to launder is always the problem.

274
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,431
Speaker 0: Yeah However, they do that.

275
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:05,937
Speaker 0: I'm Convinced selling drugs perhaps selling community.

276
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:06,379
Speaker 0: Yep.

277
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:18,907
Speaker 0: So I really really really think that online advertising is hugely bolstered as an industry by organized crime.

278
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:35,760
Speaker 0: and I suspect if you are able to crack down on the organized crime that is likely Blondering money and or using this network for other purposes and get remove it from advertising That online advertising as an industry would fall fucking apart and there would be a big disaster.

279
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,997
Speaker 1: Well, they would still exist in you know cases where it's like the big companies buying ads.

280
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:41,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.

281
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:47,582
Speaker 0: But I think like a big chunk of advertising would disappear and the internet would just radically be Stabilized.

282
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:52,801
Speaker 1: for example things like the Pirate Bay that have a million shitty ads all over them that no one ever clicks on and everyone Hates.

283
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:54,727
Speaker 1: no one's buying those ads.

284
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,515
Speaker 1: You ever wonder why those ads are mostly for porn and casinos.

285
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:01,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like That.

286
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:03,733
Speaker 0: Facebook ads 80% of the clicks are bots.

287
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:04,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about right.

288
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,279
Speaker 0: Yeah.

289
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:12,640
Speaker 0: So all these things together are really interesting and this is a world that More investigative journalism needs to be done.

290
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:16,260
Speaker 0: I don't want to name names and I don't want to be guilty of libel or slander or anything.

291
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,926
Speaker 0: But there's some specific game companies.

292
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,474
Speaker 0: I actually suspect of doing this like for real.

293
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:20,896
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

294
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:31,164
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day Scott's is super serious.

295
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,170
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna give you the non serious one first.

296
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,256
Speaker 1: How could non serious could it be?

297
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:39,291
Speaker 0: So Jackie Chan Super funny dude super funny movies.

298
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,420
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan movies in general.

299
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,639
Speaker 0: I'm also a big fan of kung-fu movies in general.

300
00:20:44,382 --> 00:21:04,483
Speaker 0: but this is a video where someone analyzes Jackie Chan films and Explains basically how to do action comedy why Jackie Chan did it very well why modern movies are awful at it and It's just a really good 10-minute video that goes into a lot of depth and was made by someone who's very observant very intelligent Knowledgeable, I

301
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:10,928
Speaker 1: mean really what it comes down to is that modern movies have an action scene and a comedy scene and they don't do Them in the same scene.

302
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:16,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, or even if they do do them in the same scene The comedy and the action will be not the same thing.

303
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,536
Speaker 0: They're not integrated.

304
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:18,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like separate.

305
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,041
Speaker 0: There'll be.

306
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:26,780
Speaker 1: someone will like do some punching and kicking and then stop it like spider-man, you know Well, even the comic spider-man doesn't really merge his stuff

307
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,010
Speaker 0: But up there hanging then he says his witty one says

308
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,748
Speaker 1: his witty one-liner and then he fights and then he stops and then But his fighting itself is not funny Jackie Chan.

309
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:40,881
Speaker 1: His thing was his actual action of fighting was in itself Comedic.

310
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:41,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what actually.

311
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:45,320
Speaker 0: our friend the juggler Luke Burrage explained this with a nice analogies.

312
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,571
Speaker 0: We were he was talking about doing a new bit and juggling and a bunch of us were like Ah, you should do the bit like this.

313
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:59,180
Speaker 0: and he was like you Americans You always have if you want to do a juggling routine You always think of it as you're gonna do some juggling and you're also telling jokes and things and they're separate.

314
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:04,636
Speaker 0: The whole point is that the juggling itself is the joke and you're augmenting it exactly.

315
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:19,064
Speaker 0: so this video is great and If you watch this This is why I don't find a lot of the action movies that you guys like to be particularly entertaining or funny Even when they're intending to be funny, I mean It's not like action.

316
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:27,436
Speaker 1: comedy is like a particular thing that I'm like mega into but it's just one more example of reasons I hardly ever watch any new movie ever.

317
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,064
Speaker 0: Yep I mean one of the like.

318
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:34,920
Speaker 0: it talks about how a genre of any kind even good like modern action movies in the u.s.

319
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:40,522
Speaker 0: At least usually have a ton of jump cuts and they do all these things to obfuscate the actual like Transformers.

320
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:48,528
Speaker 0: those see those action scenes in the Transformers movies are just a bunch of Nonsensical garbage flying around the screen.

321
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,039
Speaker 0: Jackie Chan is a long cut of him hurting himself physically.

322
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,110
Speaker 1: All right, so serious thing of the day.

323
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:58,100
Speaker 1: so I know a lot of people out there.

324
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:03,240
Speaker 1: They just so mad about politics and shit all the time and I'm just like shut up everybody.

325
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:07,720
Speaker 1: All you guys keep doing the same the same thing over and over again for no reason with no effect whatsoever.

326
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:12,537
Speaker 1: So I have found a key piece of evidence to support my position.

327
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:25,818
Speaker 0: Yep This video other than the fact that the word Negro comes out in the first 30 seconds Yeah, as does the words the word Arabia yep, but otherwise this video might as well.

328
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,002
Speaker 1: it is 1965.

329
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:29,711
Speaker 0: that wasn't that long ago as long ago.

330
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,393
Speaker 1: So in 1965, mr.

331
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:42,980
Speaker 1: X. Mr Malcolm X appeared on the CBC the Canadian Broadcasting Company and A bunch of white dudes asked him a bunch of questions a lot of back-handedly insulting questions.

332
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:52,420
Speaker 1: Pretty much the same kind of questions you'd get from a white right-wing dude on Fox News today But coached with a nice sort of Canadian sensibility very very masking.

333
00:23:52,460 --> 00:24:01,490
Speaker 1: The one major difference is that unlike say a Fox News of today these white dudes Actually shut up and didn't say anything or interrupt.

334
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:01,751
Speaker 1: Mr.

335
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:03,718
Speaker 1: X while he was talking and mr.

336
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:03,758
Speaker 1: X?

337
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:06,246
Speaker 1: Well, I don't agree with everything.

338
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:06,507
Speaker 1: Mr.

339
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:12,979
Speaker 1: X stood for in his day, you know, I'm not exactly a Muslim You know quite the opposite in fact.

340
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:23,379
Speaker 0: So Pretty much is Judaism or that Judaism is the opposite of Islam the combination of the two.

341
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:41,160
Speaker 1: He pretty much argues his point in an intelligent rational Educated fashion the same way that we would argue our points in an intelligent rational educated fashion Even though lately I've been giving up and just calling people ignorant bad, right?

342
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,365
Speaker 1: Because it's pretty much no point.

343
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:47,980
Speaker 1: even though he did this back in the day on TV It didn't matter.

344
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:52,052
Speaker 1: All you're yelling and whining doesn't actually change anything.

345
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,257
Speaker 1: and that's part of what mr.

346
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:54,060
Speaker 1: X has to say.

347
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,460
Speaker 1: He says look, you know, I love Martin Luther King sand, but it's not getting anything done and all you guys blocking traffic.

348
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,003
Speaker 1: It's like look.

349
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:02,813
Speaker 1: I love you blocking traffic out there.

350
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,939
Speaker 1: I totally agree with you.

351
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:12,814
Speaker 1: I hate cars too, so I'm actually happy that you're fucking up the traffic But notice not a goddamn thing has happened or changed as a result of it.

352
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,463
Speaker 1: that is a tactic that is not Effective.

353
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:20,908
Speaker 0: thus the ever-present question whenever you bring up one of these things What is to be done?

354
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,939
Speaker 1: murder all the rich people?

355
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,469
Speaker 0: Pretty much out.

356
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:28,710
Speaker 0: Well, no There was a time in your life Scott.

357
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:34,500
Speaker 0: Yeah when you had a different answer to that question I remember what your answer used to be wait for the rich people and all people to die.

358
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:37,876
Speaker 1: Even earlier than that don't give a shit just live your life.

359
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:38,760
Speaker 0: destroy television.

360
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:40,059
Speaker 1: That's also a good move.

361
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:42,248
Speaker 0: That was we were pretty serious about.

362
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:50,579
Speaker 0: maybe a bunch of nerd terrorists should get together and just one day Literally destroy the entire global television infrastructure at once.

363
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:54,691
Speaker 1: The only reason that I don't think that's a good idea anymore.

364
00:25:55,092 --> 00:26:00,147
Speaker 1: Is that if we used a method of blowing up satellites We really it was.

365
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:02,380
Speaker 1: it was hard for the space people to get the satellites up there.

366
00:26:02,742 --> 00:26:04,531
Speaker 1: It would sort of not be cool to blow them up.

367
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,120
Speaker 0: think of the space people we need.

368
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:09,935
Speaker 1: We need some way to disable television besides blowing up all the satellites.

369
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:13,658
Speaker 0: I still think the best shot We've got is Lawrence Lessig's thing because as you can see.

370
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,904
Speaker 1: well I mean he is.

371
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:24,385
Speaker 1: he is correctly identified the ultimate root of the entire problem And but he has not found an effective solution because I don't know What did he say.

372
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:27,860
Speaker 0: the whole point of this first initiative is to try to find what yeah?

373
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:35,644
Speaker 0: Data and he just published all the data they gathered on to and how to mess with the light and it is now appears to be even more hopeless.

374
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:44,500
Speaker 0: yeah, because seriously the the gist of the statistics and the research was number of dollars equals winning election.

375
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,664
Speaker 0: Literally nothing else mattered.

376
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:55,354
Speaker 0: yes, so we need to gather dollars to fight against the people who have all the we only gathered like 12 million million.

377
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:58,719
Speaker 1: We're up against hundreds of millions.

378
00:26:58,822 --> 00:27:06,980
Speaker 1: Yeah Only way that this can possibly be fixed is if one of the ridiculously rich people Turns coat against the other ridiculous church code.

379
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:13,220
Speaker 0: But does your classic cling to the other people and set themselves on fire burn their fortune?

380
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:15,030
Speaker 1: Yes, as well as their own.

381
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:18,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, so That was depressing.

382
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:25,692
Speaker 0: but also If you don't know a lot about Malcolm X which I suspect a lot of you young kids Probably they might not even know who it is.

383
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:26,377
Speaker 1: There is a movie.

384
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:30,835
Speaker 1: It's not bad It's pretty good, but it's not a hundred and historically accurate as any movie would be.

385
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:35,360
Speaker 1: but I figure you punk kids Who know nothing you know I'm lucky if I can get you to watch the movie.

386
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,846
Speaker 0: It is accurate in one sense.

387
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:45,994
Speaker 0: Malcolm X has one of the most intense facial expressions Generally that a human being is ever held as a resting face.

388
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:50,180
Speaker 0: Yeah pretty much In the meta moment the booklet book is water ship down.

389
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,936
Speaker 0: it's about a bunch of rabbits, and it's really good, and I've moved on.

390
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:58,614
Speaker 0: I'm reading the Yiddish policeman's Union, and I'll see if I finish that before Scott starts.

391
00:27:58,675 --> 00:27:59,900
Speaker 0: water ship down, okay?

392
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:08,242
Speaker 0: Yeah We're gonna be a pack south presenting on Sunday in the armadillo theater bad games an updated version of our old panel also called bad Games.

393
00:28:08,283 --> 00:28:10,640
Speaker 1: you can't make it to pack south magfest same weekend.

394
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:19,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, same weekend, and then not too long after that we're gonna be at PAX East and then the first weekend of March yep And tiny chance we're gonna go to generic on after it.

395
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,160
Speaker 1: I say that because we've not invited generic on every year of like a zillion years.

396
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:24,487
Speaker 1: I've never gone to it ever.

397
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:24,709
Speaker 0: well.

398
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,734
Speaker 0: I feel bad isn't it?

399
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:26,780
Speaker 1: a tiny college con?

400
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:27,689
Speaker 0: We actually don't.

401
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:35,920
Speaker 1: in the cold upstate I often don't even respond to emails from conventions that ask us to attend But they've kept us on their mailing list all these years even though we've never once responded to them.

402
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,806
Speaker 0: So I'm asking you the least.

403
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,976
Speaker 1: some listener went there once and that's why you the listener.

404
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:45,268
Speaker 0: I ask you Will you be a generic on and all being?

405
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,858
Speaker 0: Oh Rensselaer, New York should we go to generic on?

406
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:49,620
Speaker 0: it's up to you.

407
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:51,339
Speaker 0: Do you think we should be there?

408
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,155
Speaker 1: Because kind of thinking about doing it does anyone who plays netrunner going to be there cuz?

409
00:28:56,175 --> 00:29:02,407
Speaker 1: then even if it's garbage You can save my weekend, and we can make it netrunner weekend Or we'll just play wizard over and over and over again.

410
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:08,588
Speaker 1: anyone who wants to play wizard will you go yeah and play wizard all Weekend if it sucks Otherwise?

411
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:09,660
Speaker 0: watch all their stuff on YouTube.

412
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,386
Speaker 1: Yeah, utenna, it's happy.

413
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:15,576
Speaker 0: yes, we recorded another episode of geek knives presents utenna.

414
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:16,820
Speaker 0: I'm editing it currently.

415
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,360
Speaker 0: I'll put it up as soon as I can, but I'm skiing Saturday and go to a party on Sunday.

416
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:23,731
Speaker 0: So we'll see when I actually get it done.

417
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:24,658
Speaker 1: break the world shell.

418
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:32,580
Speaker 0: Except the world shells cracking apparently according to episode 13 all the easier for you to break it actually.

419
00:29:34,844 --> 00:29:35,571
Speaker 1: So get cracking.

420
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:40,823
Speaker 0: so Real talk guys buses Fucking awful.

421
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:49,953
Speaker 0: well mostly I mean there are occasionally good buses very rare and even then The best buses are at best tolerable.

422
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,799
Speaker 1: Yes the most.

423
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:55,740
Speaker 1: Basically the history of buses is a history of being bad on purpose.

424
00:29:56,001 --> 00:30:00,640
Speaker 1: So I don't know if anyone here has watched Roger Rabbit the movie who framed Roger Rabbit.

425
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,925
Speaker 0: We did an episode about it.

426
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:03,090
Speaker 1: You should have seen it by now.

427
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:10,774
Speaker 1: Roger rabbit is actually a true story Not the anime cartoon part the the replace the streetcar with the bus part.

428
00:30:10,814 --> 00:30:13,020
Speaker 1: basically what happened was way back in the day.

429
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,356
Speaker 1: There were streetcars everywhere, and they were fucking awesome and people use them all the goddamn time.

430
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:22,279
Speaker 1: so people who lived in cities Didn't own any fucking cars because they didn't need that shit.

431
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like me today right only a lot more people didn't.

432
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,839
Speaker 1: now in the city even on my street.

433
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,377
Speaker 1: sure I don't have a car But this car is parked all the way up and down the street and auto shops all near my right.

434
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,146
Speaker 1: so How did that come to be?

435
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:38,780
Speaker 1: why was the streetcar which is here just decades ago now gone?

436
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,128
Speaker 1: It was like every city.

437
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:44,467
Speaker 1: even medium and small cities like Rochester New York had streetcars, and they don't have them anymore.

438
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:55,898
Speaker 1: well what happened was is GM and other car companies in the US Realized huh we could sell a lot more cars if people actually needed them to get around and couldn't just use a streetcar.

439
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:56,400
Speaker 1: some shit.

440
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:01,160
Speaker 1: So they bought the streetcar owning companies which were private companies.

441
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,819
Speaker 1: They weren't like the MTA some public thing you couldn't buy and they just shut them down.

442
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,597
Speaker 1: and Then they said oh, I guess they had to replace these with something.

443
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,364
Speaker 1: They replaced him with buses.

444
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,836
Speaker 1: so okay people just use the bus instead of buying cars.

445
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:15,860
Speaker 1: What did they accomplish?

446
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,095
Speaker 1: Well number one since their car companies and not train companies.

447
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:20,140
Speaker 1: They made buses.

448
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,190
Speaker 1: They didn't make train cars.

449
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:33,074
Speaker 1: and number two it also You know buses use roads, and if they made roads for buses while you're making roads for cars Which is good for them yep making things like superhighways for their cars.

450
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:40,588
Speaker 1: and three They made the bus schedule since they own the bus companies Really shitty on purpose.

451
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:42,439
Speaker 1: and they made the way buses work.

452
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:48,481
Speaker 1: Just shitty on purpose so that you would ride the bus and hate it and then get a car to save you from the horrible Bus.

453
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:55,985
Speaker 0: and meanwhile even if they hadn't done that because of the rising cars the buses got stuck in traffic Thus defeating the purpose.

454
00:31:56,366 --> 00:32:00,760
Speaker 0: buses are way less comfortable than streetcars because of bus suspensions.

455
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,774
Speaker 0: Yep, the everything is wrong with them.

456
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:16,880
Speaker 0: and now today I mean Scott and Emily and I live in literally one of the only places in North America You can live and not own a car and even then not all the parts of this place can be lived in without a car

457
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,004
Speaker 1: Even the rest of the world.

458
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:22,060
Speaker 1: somehow this problem spread because I guess you know they looked at us as a model.

459
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,692
Speaker 1: We did invent the car right the Model T and whatnot.

460
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:26,776
Speaker 1: so you know.

461
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:32,975
Speaker 1: but the rest of the world pretty much You know copied the model of America like oh you want to be awesome like America got have roads everywhere.

462
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:41,373
Speaker 0: so Gothamist Which is basically you should not read the Gothamist unless you live in New York But if you live in New York you will get the wrong idea about New York.

463
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:47,880
Speaker 1: if you read this without living here if you Live here, then you will understand these articles the way they are meant to be understood.

464
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:53,418
Speaker 0: These articles are this is real, New York for New Yorkers and literally not that context.

465
00:32:53,458 --> 00:33:02,620
Speaker 0: you don't live here It's not for you Yeah But they recently had that they linked to the survey of like average bus speeds in New York two miles an hour.

466
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they listed like the buses in terms of how fast and slow they go.

467
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:18,879
Speaker 0: a good number of buses average less than two miles an hour yep meaning I Walk faster than most buses in New York.

468
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,490
Speaker 0: yep, and these are the buses I would take to like go cross town.

469
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:30,903
Speaker 0: I mean I remember once I was walking to the Javits for a New York comic-con and My options were fucking walk there or take the m42 bus soon.

470
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,528
Speaker 0: We'll have a new option the m42 go.

471
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:34,400
Speaker 0: yeah No, because we'll ever be m34.

472
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,433
Speaker 0: no I mean the m42.

473
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:41,870
Speaker 0: okay take the m42 across 42nd Street all the way to the end and then walk down a little bit.

474
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,975
Speaker 0: You get to the top of the Javits.

475
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:52,050
Speaker 0: okay way more convenient than taking the m32 all the way across or Taking the e train to Penn or whatever and then walk into that fucking underpass and then walking forever.

476
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:53,716
Speaker 0: And I remember I was walking.

477
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:54,319
Speaker 0: I was walking.

478
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:54,942
Speaker 0: I was walking.

479
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:56,168
Speaker 0: I saw the m42 bus.

480
00:33:56,671 --> 00:34:01,544
Speaker 0: I was like oh, maybe I'll just get on that That'll get me there faster, and then I like didn't have a metro car.

481
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:02,610
Speaker 0: and I was like yeah, whatever fuck it.

482
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,959
Speaker 0: So I just kept walking and yeah, I beat the bus there in fact.

483
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:09,629
Speaker 0: I passed a second m42 bus while I was walking mm-hmm.

484
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:15,230
Speaker 0: So buses in New York are useless and the few people who have to commute on buses.

485
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,525
Speaker 0: I feel really bad for you if I had to commute on a bus in New York.

486
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,579
Speaker 0: I'd buy a car Mm-hmm like for real.

487
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,909
Speaker 0: I'd buy a car yeah.

488
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,936
Speaker 1: So the last time I tried to take the city bus The subway wasn't working.

489
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:28,920
Speaker 1: it wasn't going up.

490
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:29,222
Speaker 1: You know.

491
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:33,215
Speaker 1: so I was here basically at rims house Effectively same area.

492
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,847
Speaker 1: oh yeah, and the subway would not go north to where I live.

493
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:37,889
Speaker 1: so there's only two lines.

494
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,634
Speaker 0: They go where you live.

495
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,210
Speaker 1: there's a bus that actually takes a more direct route.

496
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:43,860
Speaker 0: Yeah The bus that Emily always wants us to take to visit Scott.

497
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,190
Speaker 0: because on you know the buses route goes Literally right from our apartment to like right next to Scott's house like it's great.

498
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you take the subway the subway is a bit east from both of us.

499
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,161
Speaker 1: So I have to.

500
00:34:54,303 --> 00:35:04,050
Speaker 1: then if I take the subway Which is what I usually take I then have to walk a bunch West to get to where I live the subway the bus Stops right at my apartment effectively like a block away.

501
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,528
Speaker 1: So why not take this bus?

502
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:11,390
Speaker 1: well I went over to take this bus and of course there was mad Crowding on the bus stop because no one could take the subway.

503
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,255
Speaker 1: And they were trying to do this.

504
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:18,224
Speaker 1: but even without that crowding The bus comes like once every 20 minutes or something.

505
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:21,456
Speaker 1: the subway comes like every Five minutes even less than that.

506
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:25,850
Speaker 0: yeah during rush hour a seven train comes every make a train comes in the train goes out another train.

507
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:32,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there's a train queued up to come in as soon as the next train land the train carries a zillion people and the bus Carries like 50 people at best.

508
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,869
Speaker 1: That's a crowded ass bus with 50 people.

509
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,519
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you're lucky Maybe 30 people.

510
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:40,935
Speaker 0: and even then when you get on a bus This is the read that the biggest problem I have with buses.

511
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:46,317
Speaker 0: and why even if we fix a lot of the problems with buses this Fundamental flaw makes buses still a bad idea.

512
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:50,970
Speaker 0: do to ride a bus that you don't ride every single day.

513
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:57,446
Speaker 0: You have to pay attention For much of the time you're on the bus to make sure you get off at the right place.

514
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,274
Speaker 0: you have to know the neighborhood You're going to.

515
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:01,506
Speaker 1: you have to know where the bus stop is and push the thing.

516
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,961
Speaker 0: it's not like the bus Tells you where it is.

517
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:04,790
Speaker 0: you have to look out the way.

518
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,170
Speaker 1: I'll be like stop something something we are currently at this stop.

519
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:08,832
Speaker 1: You know.

520
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:15,771
Speaker 1: you get to like know the bus route like it requires a lot of specialized knowledge And didn't be able to ride the bus It's not.

521
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:21,743
Speaker 0: or you have to sit and stare at your phone on the GPS and like watch it until you figure out where you Are and then get off at the right spot keep

522
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:28,930
Speaker 1: looking out the window And you see a stop and you're pretty close to where you want to be and you're like well Do I get off here or will the bus stop even closer?

523
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:36,403
Speaker 1: I don't know the streetcar the tram like even if I stay on it for you know it's like okay I'm really close to where I am now if I stay on how far past.

524
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,030
Speaker 1: where I want to go is the next stop.

525
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,797
Speaker 0: Yep, but like a tram network.

526
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:42,047
Speaker 0: leaving in Melbourne like we were there for Pax Australia last year.

527
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:44,528
Speaker 0: the tram network There is super extensive, but you know what?

528
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,830
Speaker 0: Every station like you knew exactly where you were getting on and off.

529
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,858
Speaker 0: It was really easy to actually ride it.

530
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,288
Speaker 0: as a result you didn't have to pay attention the whole time yep.

531
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:58,590
Speaker 0: So buses are super uncomfortable to ride from the fact that you can't just zone out on the subway.

532
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:02,850
Speaker 0: They go from predefined places to other predefined places.

533
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:11,990
Speaker 0: You can look at the subway map and immediately know how to get from point A to point B and take a nap Exactly and then get wake up and get off because a thing goes bong.

534
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:15,081
Speaker 0: The next station will be Grand Central terminal.

535
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,245
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah blah.

536
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,609
Speaker 0: You know exactly where you are.

537
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:26,430
Speaker 0: Also the Subways are just generally way faster because they don't get stuck in any traffic other than subway traffic.

538
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:30,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're also way faster because they're giant awesome trains.

539
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:35,035
Speaker 0: Yep, and they hold a bazillion people Also energy efficient.

540
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:36,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk about looting.

541
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:40,695
Speaker 1: well some electric buses out there like Seattle has the Catenary buses.

542
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:46,155
Speaker 1: yeah those buses and a lot of buses in New York are all like Hybrid electric butts.

543
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:51,429
Speaker 0: it's yeah, so they can recapture all that braking when they stop at every intersection for an hour.

544
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,455
Speaker 1: yes Exactly sometimes.

545
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:55,783
Speaker 1: There's a bus only lane on certain roads also.

546
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:57,809
Speaker 1: There's no one's ever parked in that or biking in it.

547
00:37:58,271 --> 00:37:59,536
Speaker 0: There is another problem.

548
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,198
Speaker 0: That's kind of the.

549
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:07,442
Speaker 0: it's a touchy subject to bring up But it needs to be talked about because the buses suck.

550
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:13,101
Speaker 0: the buses are primarily used by lowers those Geoeconomic strata in most places in the u.s..

551
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:13,282
Speaker 1: Well.

552
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:17,133
Speaker 1: No, it's because the buses Well are.

553
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,317
Speaker 1: so in areas

554
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:18,858
Speaker 0: it has

555
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:29,202
Speaker 1: 22 yes in areas where people who don't have a lot of money live They don't build awesome subways, and if they do build an awesome subway there it gentrifies And those people get kicked out of that neighborhood

556
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:30,410
Speaker 0: like they just added a new subway.

557
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:37,730
Speaker 1: So on the seven line if you buy the Javits if you don't have a lot of money You can't really live in an area that's convenient by subway very easily.

558
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:40,822
Speaker 1: So the only thing that's gonna help you in your area is bus.

559
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,490
Speaker 1: oh and by the way you're poor So you can't buy a car or anything.

560
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:57,490
Speaker 0: So it is not a lie to say that in most parts of New York and most parts of America Buses are ridden by people who don't have a lot of money, which is highly correlated with things like crime.

561
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:04,450
Speaker 0: So a lot of shitty things happen on buses way more frequently than they happen on subways and trains.

562
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:06,337
Speaker 0: Yep, that's so.

563
00:39:06,497 --> 00:39:07,802
Speaker 0: as a result as a person.

564
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:09,970
Speaker 0: I really try to avoid riding buses.

565
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:13,930
Speaker 0: That is one of the many reasons why I try to avoid your wealth privilege.

566
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,738
Speaker 1: Yes, you don't have to ride the bus.

567
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,964
Speaker 1: exactly poor people.

568
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,915
Speaker 0: if the subway isn't running I'll actually just take a cab.

569
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:24,109
Speaker 1: and if you did ride the bus you wouldn't have to ride in the back because you're white.

570
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:32,323
Speaker 1: What too soon Yeah, so I prefer the back of the bus.

571
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:34,110
Speaker 1: I never knew why anyone thought the front was better.

572
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:35,368
Speaker 0: Well, what about it?

573
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:36,873
Speaker 0: School buses?

574
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:41,070
Speaker 0: the back of the bus is the best bus driver can't fucking get you and you're back there.

575
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:41,313
Speaker 0: Let's try.

576
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,710
Speaker 1: ever can't get you even if you're in the front seat.

577
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,317
Speaker 1: What are they gonna do?

578
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:44,470
Speaker 1: get up and stop driving?

579
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,464
Speaker 0: You can rate how cool a kid is in the United States by how far back they're sitting.

580
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:56,290
Speaker 0: the coolest kid in any middle school Is the one sitting in that short seat next to the emergency exit at the back by himself?

581
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,865
Speaker 1: Yep, that is then when they get off the bus to go home They open up that emergency exit and jump out.

582
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:02,610
Speaker 1: and don't give a fuck.

583
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, the bus drivers like get back here.

584
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,926
Speaker 1: Jimmy Joe it's like I'm in my house motherfucker.

585
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:07,750
Speaker 1: what you can do about it?

586
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,076
Speaker 0: Good what you're gonna write my head.

587
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:11,407
Speaker 1: You're gonna pick my ass up to go to school tomorrow.

588
00:40:11,427 --> 00:40:12,010
Speaker 1: That's what you can do.

589
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,666
Speaker 1: Yep, you know, I'm about to play Nintendo games.

590
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:20,207
Speaker 0: Whoo Yeah, the kids sitting in the gimpy short seat at the back of a middle school bus is cock-fucking-robin.

591
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:25,290
Speaker 1: That's right Because if he wasn't the kid who was it beat him up and kick him out and get him.

592
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:34,649
Speaker 0: Though it's complicated because then after you get a few seats up the kids who were like three or four rows up are the least Cool kids who are trying to be with the cool kids.

593
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:41,855
Speaker 0: Yeah And then at the way front are the cool kids who are smart and don't want to be bullied by the shitheads near the back The middle distance.

594
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:45,270
Speaker 1: people are just like the normal kids who don't give a fuck about social whatever.

595
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,655
Speaker 1: They're just going to school and they're out.

596
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,059
Speaker 1: Those are the normal cool people.

597
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

598
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:51,390
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, that's that's a lesson in middle school.

599
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:58,370
Speaker 0: So there are some buses that are quality like the Express buses that go directly from like a neighborhood in Connecticut to Midtown, right?

600
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,810
Speaker 1: Well, I mean those are okay, but they're like, you know, for example the boat bus, right?

601
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,172
Speaker 0: It's it's a bus is barely tolerable and getting worse It's.

602
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:08,470
Speaker 1: uh, I mean it is getting worse, but it's at least you know, it gets the job done.

603
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,650
Speaker 1: I need to get to that city for an extremely low price.

604
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:17,109
Speaker 1: It will mostly much more safely than say shady Chinatown bus which are all gone now.

605
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:22,595
Speaker 1: Yes, thankfully take me to that city in a reasonable fashion I won't have to.

606
00:41:22,736 --> 00:41:25,750
Speaker 1: a lot of the problems that you talked about don't exist on there.

607
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:32,030
Speaker 0: Like the few times he took mega buses like shit like a couple of times shit went down when I was not a mega bus.

608
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,495
Speaker 0: that Would not have happened on a bolt bus.

609
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:37,390
Speaker 1: Yep, but functionally the reason is you have to buy your boat bus ticket on internet.

610
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:43,873
Speaker 0: yep, and somehow people haven't figured out how to get that fries a Priority boarding.

611
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:44,193
Speaker 0: Yep.

612
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:47,362
Speaker 0: The answer is if you buy it online you get a.

613
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:51,576
Speaker 1: no you get a. if you register and log into the Bolt bus website then buy the ticket.

614
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:56,565
Speaker 1: if you just buy the ticket as like a guest without logging in then you don't get a. You get B or C.

615
00:41:56,767 --> 00:42:03,273
Speaker 0: and meanwhile I was amazed at all these people who like line up without a ticket like trying to get onto the bus in case someone like Doesn't show up.

616
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:03,755
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

617
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:07,390
Speaker 0: Like everywhere I travel like at airports at train stations.

618
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:12,786
Speaker 0: So many people are at an airport or a train station on standby.

619
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,270
Speaker 1: I don't understand how that happens.

620
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,930
Speaker 1: I've never had to be on standby in my life.

621
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:23,492
Speaker 0: The only time I was ever on standby was when the only time I can airlines like all their staff went on strike and they canceled Every flight.

622
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:31,820
Speaker 1: the only time I can imagine this happening is literally if my flight got canceled in which case I would go to the Counter and be like look my flight was canceled.

623
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,824
Speaker 1: I gave you fucking money.

624
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:34,230
Speaker 1: You're gonna fly me where I want to go.

625
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:35,375
Speaker 1: When is that gonna happen?

626
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:40,071
Speaker 1: And they would tell me if they said I don't know I would go to a hotel Immediately.

627
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:45,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then wait and make phone calls when appropriate and cetera until you know We had Scott.

628
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:51,970
Speaker 0: that is that is the privilege of someone who has money and is willing to suffer any amount of financial.

629
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:58,910
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make them pay for that hotel room - yeah, I'm not paying for that and then follow it up with righteous indignation.

630
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:00,450
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

631
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:04,090
Speaker 1: So, I mean, there's no reason me to stand at the airport on standby for anything.

632
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:06,050
Speaker 1: I guess there could be some emergency.

633
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:06,413
Speaker 1: We're like.

634
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:11,906
Speaker 1: I just have to get to Saskatchewan like it like today and then there's no way I could buy it.

635
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:12,930
Speaker 1: I just gotta go to the airport.

636
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:14,148
Speaker 0: No, you know what I would do.

637
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:17,701
Speaker 0: I Like if you can't like if you can't fly and like standbys.

638
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:21,137
Speaker 0: not I'm the kind of person who's rent a car and drive Right out of the airport.

639
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,103
Speaker 1: we could do that.

640
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:25,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did From here.

641
00:43:25,453 --> 00:43:32,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we drove in shifts we could be there and if I had to guess two or three days No, we could do a faster than that.

642
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:33,353
Speaker 1: if I need to be there I drove.

643
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:34,337
Speaker 0: we fucking.

644
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:40,041
Speaker 0: it takes two days to drive from Detroit to like the middle of Florida If you drive in shifts and with some sleeping.

645
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:44,755
Speaker 0: so we could totally get to Saskatchewan Inside of two days.

646
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:48,190
Speaker 1: if we drove in shifts and never saw this mad bad weather right now, and it's Canada.

647
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, Canada knows that deal with bad weather.

648
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:51,904
Speaker 0: I grew up in Michigan.

649
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:53,050
Speaker 0: I could drive in bad weather's fine.

650
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,530
Speaker 0: Where are we gonna rent a car that has snow chains in the trunk?

651
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,997
Speaker 0: Do you know how to put snow chains on?

652
00:43:59,258 --> 00:44:01,969
Speaker 1: I know how to Google and watch a YouTube video showing me how to do it.

653
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:07,250
Speaker 0: So the you know, it's funny because you brought up bolt bus and like I said mega bus and all these things.

654
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,415
Speaker 0: There's another bus like that.

655
00:44:08,636 --> 00:44:11,770
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm riding one on Saturday urban Sherpa in New York.

656
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:19,139
Speaker 0: I can pay somebody like 60 bucks and they will at 6 a.m You pay 60 bucks for that.

657
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,285
Speaker 1: now, I don't feel bad about things.

658
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,190
Speaker 1: I've wasted 60 bucks.

659
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:32,678
Speaker 0: They picked me up in Times Square Drive me to Hunter Mountain and drop me off at the ski mountain and then at 4 30 p.m Drive me back to Times Square and drop me off.

660
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,890
Speaker 1: There's no white privilege bus like a bus going to a ski resort.

661
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:43,870
Speaker 0: So from New York City, this is what I'm getting at New York's like bolt bus kind of like jet-blue all these things.

662
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:48,149
Speaker 0: They exist because of New York, they don't exist anywhere else.

663
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:49,895
Speaker 1: I'm sure they exist somewhere else.

664
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:50,978
Speaker 1: new most cities

665
00:44:51,038 --> 00:45:07,997
Speaker 0: do not have the kinds of buses that we have access to here Mmm, like if you want to take a bus to somewhere outside of New York That isn't serviced by like bolt bus one almost no one goes there and two you're on fucking Peter Pan and that bus is just a Eight-hour nightmare.

666
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:09,284
Speaker 1: Yeah something else though.

667
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:15,188
Speaker 1: I think other countries Some of them, you know, especially the nice ones have much better buses than we have.

668
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,415
Speaker 0: Yes, they do That is true.

669
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:22,240
Speaker 1: If we if we go to like Asia's or Europe's or you know places like that.

670
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:25,230
Speaker 1: I'm sure that they have buses that are like they go on.

671
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,929
Speaker 0: Hey, we're just talking about American buses.

672
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's a lot of those are just indicative of the.

673
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:33,021
Speaker 1: you know You can see how just talking about one thing the bus.

674
00:45:33,342 --> 00:45:35,230
Speaker 1: We're really just talking about the problems of America.

675
00:45:36,073 --> 00:45:40,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just all appear on the bus To get more.

676
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,349
Speaker 0: because I was talking about like the privilege of these buses networks we have in New York.

677
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:49,716
Speaker 0: our Friends like we go to conventions and we take bolt bus to a lot of the conventions we go to because it's just like it Goes.

678
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:54,790
Speaker 0: it's the best way It'll pick us up in New York and go directly to like the convention.

679
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:58,430
Speaker 1: So the bus that goes to Boston is pretty much a few blocks away from PAX East.

680
00:45:58,632 --> 00:45:59,522
Speaker 1: Yes, you can walk.

681
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,150
Speaker 1: it's so great.

682
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:09,686
Speaker 0: Our friends are all like oh how you guys get into PAX and for them taking a bus is a nightmare Because both bus doesn't go direct from where they live to Boston.

683
00:46:09,706 --> 00:46:10,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, we live in New York City.

684
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:21,787
Speaker 1: They live like even if you live in White Plains pretty close to New York City You're gonna what you knew you did come to New York City on Metro north and then take but it's like and there's no transportation directly from there too.

685
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:29,922
Speaker 0: So instead like pretty much for all of them driving is the best option except then they got a park and park is like 60 Bucks a day for like Boston.

686
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:33,868
Speaker 0: Yeah 60 bucks a day is a pretty low-end price.

687
00:46:33,908 --> 00:46:39,350
Speaker 1: to park Bus cost me like me possibly $1 each way if I buy my ticket early enough.

688
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I usually like 12 bucks each way.

689
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

690
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:56,370
Speaker 0: So so Buses work like there's buses and all these mass transit options related to buses that we have here Don't exist in most of the rest of New York because there is such a demand for mass transit.

691
00:46:57,074 --> 00:47:03,924
Speaker 0: But at the same time we won't build it and as a result buses For the vast majority of humans who will ever ride them who don't live in New York City.

692
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:05,448
Speaker 0: fucking nightmares.

693
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:15,070
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, like I if my only option is a bus I either won't go or I'll rent a car most of the time and most of the country.

694
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:18,321
Speaker 1: Right pretty much anywhere you live in the United States.

695
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:23,030
Speaker 1: Like I don't think there's been a civilized place I've lived where there isn't actually like a bus system.

696
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:38,330
Speaker 1: it's like there's no other public transportation usually except outside of major cities, but even near my parents house or You know out in all kinds of middle-of-nowhere places There's still some sort of bus system and some sort of bus stop like remember we live in Rochester, right?

697
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,420
Speaker 0: Remember when we didn't have a car as freshman we wanted by.

698
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:43,990
Speaker 1: Rochester doesn't have a subway or anything, but they have buses.

699
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:48,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, it would take us half a day to buy groceries by using that bus.

700
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:53,550
Speaker 0: That bus took for fucking ever and then we had to carry all our groceries on the bus.

701
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,519
Speaker 1: It was awful, but we did a lot.

702
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it sucked but Wegmans was nice.

703
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,345
Speaker 0: And then you know as soon as we were sophomores, I had a car.

704
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:07,212
Speaker 0: I drove Everyone we knew to the grocery store Everyone.

705
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:11,890
Speaker 0: repeatedly I was I bought me driving people around was how I afforded gas.

706
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:19,960
Speaker 0: so But beyond that our friend Luke, I remember he was like, ah, the bus is fine You need to own a car in Rochester.

707
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:22,949
Speaker 0: and then one day I was like Luke How long does it take you to get to work?

708
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,761
Speaker 0: How long does it actually take you door-to-door?

709
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:30,600
Speaker 0: and he was like like an hour and a half It's not that bad and one he was lying.

710
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,790
Speaker 0: It actually took like two and a half hours and two.

711
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:36,009
