1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,848
Speaker 0: It's Monday, May 7th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:12,309
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,280
Speaker 0: I'm sky and this is geek nights tonight to the web vulnerabilities.

4
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,218
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:34,520
Speaker 0: So I just stopped to get some lettuce for the the bunnies on the way home And I go to Grand Central fancy market and there's a new place there that I hadn't noticed before.

6
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:39,780
Speaker 0: Okay inside and they sell like baked goods and fancy cookies, but they're not sorrows fuck sorrows.

7
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:46,300
Speaker 0: They're like the worst blandest anyway, so I go over there and I'm like, alright, I'm kind of hungry.

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,980
Speaker 0: So I get like a cookie and I get a little like a little small package of cookies and two things of fancy-looking crackers.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,560
Speaker 0: I go to the front to pay and I don't really you know when I buy small things.

10
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:59,320
Speaker 0: I don't like look at what they cost because I assume they're reasonable.

11
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:03,957
Speaker 0: So I get up there and she's like that'll be thirty four ninety eight and I'm like for what?

12
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:04,760
Speaker 1: What were you buying?

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:18,500
Speaker 0: so, like I said, so 2020. and then I realized that that won't be enough because of the amount of money she said Which doesn't jive with the amount of goods and services that I'm acquired the amount of goods.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:29,740
Speaker 0: So I stopped and I say excuse me thirty bucks for that for what that was one Ginger cookie like a normal like, you know big ginger cookie not as big as the panko to the end.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,403
Speaker 0: No, not like.

16
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:41,891
Speaker 0: I would order the size which is three dollars and change Two but small boxes of fancy but very small crackers and one small carton of about 14 cookies.

17
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,672
Speaker 0: so I'm like How can this be 34 whatever dollars?

18
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,640
Speaker 0: This is ludicrous and she gets really huffy like.

19
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:53,551
Speaker 0: Well, this cost this and the crackers everything were reasonable.

20
00:01:54,173 --> 00:02:00,733
Speaker 0: that little pack of cookies was like $16 and I'm like, are they really that good?

21
00:02:00,774 --> 00:02:02,400
Speaker 0: and she's like, yeah, and I'm like, oh, I don't want him.

22
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:09,598
Speaker 0: It was this tiny pack that would have been more than a dollar a cookie for these tiny little cookies I think can't be that good.

23
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,009
Speaker 0: But I just I was dumbstruck by that.

24
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,233
Speaker 0: Like I didn't know what to do.

25
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:15,337
Speaker 1: What was it in them?

26
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:15,939
Speaker 1: truffles?

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,210
Speaker 1: and gold?

28
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,122
Speaker 0: I Don't even know.

29
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:24,699
Speaker 0: I picked I picked him up semi randomly foie gras truffle cookies.

30
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:29,006
Speaker 0: Even then $15 to be fair.

31
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:32,736
Speaker 0: The carton was really heavy, but it was clear I could see inside.

32
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:39,955
Speaker 0: there were not that many cookies led And we also did the five borough bike tour over the weekend.

33
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:40,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was fun.

34
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, my I was a little disappointed that I was doing fine.

35
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:50,769
Speaker 0: Like I was in the right heat I made it all the way up to like the middle front of the blue pack and then Half a little over half way through the race.

36
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,540
Speaker 0: My right knee looked at me and said, you know what rim?

37
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:53,983
Speaker 0: Fuck this.

38
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,460
Speaker 0: and I basically had to do the whole rest of the race primarily using my left leg.

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,219
Speaker 0: So now my right knee hurts and my left leg hurts.

40
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:07,820
Speaker 0: Okay, but I did do a little bit of research and talk to a doctor and I think I know how to handle this.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,629
Speaker 1: He surgery.

42
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:13,863
Speaker 1: Nope Yeah, hitting your knee with a book It's Gideon's knee.

43
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:22,218
Speaker 0: So apparently this particular kind of knee pain is caused when you're pushing too hard with too low of a cadence.

44
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:33,537
Speaker 0: So the best strategy is to go here lower gear and if you're going on a long-distance bike race The doctor and a bunch of websites I found said that you should be pedaling above 80 rpm.

45
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,520
Speaker 0: Otherwise you're prone to that over long distances and sprinting and all these things are different, but I thought that was interesting.

46
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:42,544
Speaker 0: Thought you should know.

47
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:43,427
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,214
Speaker 0: And by you I mean all of you out there.

49
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:46,800
Speaker 1: So use lower gear pedal harder.

50
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:48,766
Speaker 0: Basic pedal faster.

51
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:51,360
Speaker 0: Yeah harder, right, but I mean it was fun.

52
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,805
Speaker 0: I got a time-lapse.

53
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:58,613
Speaker 1: if I'm pedaling over 80 rpm and it's just spinning cuz I'm going too fast Then you need a differently geared bike.

54
00:03:58,936 --> 00:03:59,340
Speaker 1: Okay?

55
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,220
Speaker 0: My only complaint well not a complaint because this was not a race.

56
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,999
Speaker 0: It was not like a hardcore like there was no prize for coming in first.

57
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,280
Speaker 0: nor Could you come in first because there is no further than hat?

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,366
Speaker 0: Well, there is a first person.

59
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:18,357
Speaker 0: The problem is more than half the people in the event are People who have to walk their bike up all the hills or little kids.

60
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,947
Speaker 1: Yeah I actually didn't see half the people walking up the hills.

61
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,120
Speaker 1: I saw like one in 20 people walking up the hills.

62
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:28,165
Speaker 1: I think like whenever I got to a hill there would be one or two people Talking and everyone else.

63
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:34,499
Speaker 0: but I think the reason I saw more is that I was in the second heat So I passed the entire trailing edge of your heat.

64
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:39,760
Speaker 0: So I passed all the slowest people in the front heat and they were walking up every step.

65
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:44,325
Speaker 1: I was in the front heat and I went basically You know that the first people to leave.

66
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:50,063
Speaker 1: I got to Astoria and for the first time ever in my life during a strenuous Athletic activity.

67
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:57,792
Speaker 1: usually what happens if I try to like run a mile or something is my lungs go out don't breathe no more Except not a heart attack.

68
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:01,166
Speaker 1: I said Right, and then I go.

69
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:03,613
Speaker 1: oh man, my leg still feels good.

70
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,596
Speaker 1: I could keep going.

71
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:07,739
Speaker 1: My heart lungs like nope You're not going anywhere this time.

72
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:13,608
Speaker 1: I was going on the FDR and I was like, oh man the FDR I can never bike on this because it's I would die.

73
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,137
Speaker 1: and also you're not allowed to and I'm going.

74
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:16,759
Speaker 1: I'm going.

75
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:19,707
Speaker 1: I'm just going A little hill on the FDR and I'm like, huh?

76
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,516
Speaker 1: My legs are getting tired.

77
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,000
Speaker 0: Well Scott, you know what happened.

78
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,797
Speaker 0: You uh used to be pretty sedentary.

79
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,109
Speaker 1: now You move your ass and then I went to the Queensborough Bridge and I'm like, ah Queensborough Bridge I go over you every day.

80
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:35,608
Speaker 1: Oh upper level This is no problem.

81
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:36,772
Speaker 1: And then it's like guess what?

82
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:40,325
Speaker 1: You're not going on a pedestrian path today, son You're going to upper level.

83
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,759
Speaker 1: It's way higher and I'm like, oh my legs.

84
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:50,540
Speaker 0: The thing I got to say is this was granny gear help me This wasn't like other than going over the Verrazano at the end like that extra few miles.

85
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:55,395
Speaker 0: This was not more than like what I do in a typical weekend, but I got to ride places.

86
00:05:55,436 --> 00:06:00,183
Speaker 0: I normally don't get to ride Yeah, so All concrete.

87
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:05,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think my favorite part was riding over the crazy entrance and exit ramps on the Queensborough Bridge.

88
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:10,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so then I get to my house and I'm like my house.

89
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,759
Speaker 1: It's literally right next to the friggin bike tour, so I'm like, I'm just gonna go to my house.

90
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,680
Speaker 1: I'm like, there's no way that everyone will pass me in like 10 minutes.

91
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:33,475
Speaker 1: So I go inside my house and I realize whoa, I am way hungry literally shoved a sandwich and a banana and like two glasses of apple juice and I refilled my water and drank the water and refilled the water and peed and did all this stuff and stretched.

92
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:42,740
Speaker 1: and then I go back outside and I was in the blue group and I'm looking at you know Figuring red people are going by by now because I basically stood still for ten minutes still blue people.

93
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:46,297
Speaker 1: And then I biked for five minutes and I brought a banana with me.

94
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,499
Speaker 1: by the way You hit that mandatory rest stop.

95
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:52,700
Speaker 1: I biked for five minutes to the park not even five minutes and there's a mandatory rest stop.

96
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,413
Speaker 1: And then so I'm at the mandatory rest up.

97
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:56,619
Speaker 1: I grabbed my banana to eat it.

98
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,840
Speaker 1: You know the second banana my sweet my sweet.

99
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,669
Speaker 1: I dropped the banana and a dude immediately steps on it.

100
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I look at the rest stop this infinite free bananas.

101
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,405
Speaker 1: I'm like fuck.

102
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:08,771
Speaker 0: they were I what bunny?

103
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:09,775
Speaker 0: they were a different brand.

104
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,060
Speaker 1: It didn't matter what brand they were.

105
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:19,690
Speaker 1: I could have and I thought about seriously considered Grabbing a whole bunch of those bananas going back to my apartment just bike away with a whole crate of them Like it I'd be like.

106
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:20,944
Speaker 1: well No one caught.

107
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,260
Speaker 1: no one in the red group caught up with me in ten minutes.

108
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,913
Speaker 1: That would take about 15 minutes to go get a bunch of free banana.

109
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,061
Speaker 0: one trouble with this notice how I got a picture of It.

110
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:32,384
Speaker 0: those bananas were all Perfectly ripe.

111
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,509
Speaker 1: They were exactly good.

112
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,560
Speaker 0: They would not have been good like ten minutes later.

113
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:36,460
Speaker 1: No, they were just fine.

114
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,006
Speaker 1: but I ate like two of them.

115
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,395
Speaker 1: and then I had Lara bars which were free and all.

116
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:41,479
Speaker 1: my guy never had those before.

117
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,922
Speaker 1: those are really good and Whatever.

118
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:44,829
Speaker 1: awesome free rest stop.

119
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:46,198
Speaker 1: and then I biked the rest of the way.

120
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:50,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was super fun But then I did stop again in the Brooklyn Bridge.

121
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:56,640
Speaker 1: rest stop not cuz I actually needed stopping But because there was a great view of from there just in general and there are free bananas.

122
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,294
Speaker 0: I've been to that park area before like that.

123
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:03,033
Speaker 1: It's not much of a park Yeah, but I got to try all the other Lara bar flavors.

124
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:06,343
Speaker 1: Let's get the coconut flavoring Another banana.

125
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,975
Speaker 0: and now my stomach hurts because you realize your banana plan is reminiscent of an anecdote.

126
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:11,697
Speaker 0: Remember the soap.

127
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,729
Speaker 1: Oh My god, that's the same plan.

128
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,776
Speaker 1: It is the same plan except soap doesn't go bad Yeah, and we use that shit for years and that was shitty soap.

129
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:22,646
Speaker 0: and these are perfectly Blasted like two showers.

130
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,352
Speaker 1: The bananas are perfectly okay.

131
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,280
Speaker 0: We had more than 60 pounds of it.

132
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:29,479
Speaker 1: You should join the Fireboro bike tour for one reason free bananas.

133
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:31,429
Speaker 1: Little kids can do it.

134
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,073
Speaker 1: You can do it too.

135
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:32,860
Speaker 1: Just free bananas.

136
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:38,162
Speaker 0: Also biking through the freeway is actually surprisingly Neat.

137
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wish that was the first part.

138
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,419
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't be tired on that.

139
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,991
Speaker 0: I kind of cheated and did a pace line through all that bullshit.

140
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:45,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was really no one.

141
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,600
Speaker 0: Granted I cheated in the pace line.

142
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,719
Speaker 0: So all these super fast guys like blow by me.

143
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:51,140
Speaker 0: So I'm like, oh shit son.

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,540
Speaker 0: So I catch up to him and get in the back of their pace line and every time they shift positions Like someone's gonna take the point.

145
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,374
Speaker 0: I just backed up and the guy kind of got in.

146
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:00,460
Speaker 0: then I got right up behind him.

147
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,960
Speaker 0: So I didn't have to ever take the point and after a while take the point.

148
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:10,601
Speaker 0: Yeah after a while they noticed and they all just like sped up way faster than I could possibly go and that was the end Of me.

149
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:11,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think next year.

150
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:12,988
Speaker 1: I'll get a faster bike.

151
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:13,570
Speaker 0: Yeah.

152
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,536
Speaker 1: Well your because I test rode the $5,000 bike on Saturday.

153
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,764
Speaker 1: It is clearly superior.

154
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,790
Speaker 1: The more expensive bike is just better.

155
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:26,307
Speaker 1: The one thing I didn't realize right so I knew well If you got a faster bike, it's lighter, right?

156
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,330
Speaker 1: It has better gears.

157
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,420
Speaker 1: It has better everything more aerodynamic in the lower position.

158
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,332
Speaker 1: I knew all these things but I still also knew physics.

159
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,105
Speaker 1: right and if you get a faster car It has a bigger engine.

160
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,900
Speaker 1: no matter what bike you get the engine is your legs.

161
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,579
Speaker 1: So there isn't a bigger engine even on the fast even on the better bike.

162
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:46,479
Speaker 1: How so even if you go to the highest gear on the better bike?

163
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:51,120
Speaker 1: You still need to be able to turn it and it's just as hard to turn it as it is on the shitty bike.

164
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,260
Speaker 0: Oh my god, they've got a picture on the website of that crazy like fireball machine they had at the start.

165
00:09:57,281 --> 00:10:00,136
Speaker 1: Apparently I was completely wrong on the fancy $5,000 bike.

166
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's lighter or because it's better or because of something.

167
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,520
Speaker 1: Yeah with these same legs you can crank the highest gear with less effort.

168
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:13,900
Speaker 1: Like I cried was in the highest gear and I was like this doesn't have a higher one and I was going really fast.

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,290
Speaker 1: But it didn't feel like I was going fast and the bike was perfectly stable and it wasn't hard to pedal as it was As it is to pedal the highest gear on my current bike.

170
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:27,135
Speaker 0: The only trouble there is that the $5,000 bike is definitely superior.

171
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:31,831
Speaker 0: I'm not paying Bike but it's only like 5% better.

172
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:33,900
Speaker 1: I currently have these sub thousand dollar bikes.

173
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,060
Speaker 1: So next year, I'll probably get maybe the one or two thousand dollars.

174
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:43,413
Speaker 0: You should use a test ride my bike because that's pretty much the top of what you can get Without going to like a crazy road bike.

175
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,640
Speaker 1: I think I have to get the road bike.

176
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think is most of the riding I do.

177
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:55,283
Speaker 0: I'd rather have a hybrid so I got the best hybrid and if I ever Any time I do like a super long ride, I'm just gonna rent like the $10,000 bike I don't know.

178
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,219
Speaker 1: I don't feel comfortable riding a rented bike.

179
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,554
Speaker 1: Why bikes got to be exactly right to you.

180
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:00,400
Speaker 1: that counts for a lot.

181
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:06,959
Speaker 0: You rent a bike from a nice place that cost that much money you go in and you like you get it set by a guy Who knows more than you do about bikes?

182
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:19,033
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we got to talk about this because I didn't think the jury would actually rule today and It's kind of bad news bad news.

183
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,340
Speaker 0: So this is kind of your news.

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,891
Speaker 0: You want to take it?

185
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:28,162
Speaker 1: Yeah So if you don't know there's been a trial going on a sort of civil suit between Oracle and Google and it's because Oracle bought Sun.

186
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:29,567
Speaker 1: Sun owned Java.

187
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,771
Speaker 1: so now Oracle owns Java.

188
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,076
Speaker 1: kind of right.

189
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,486
Speaker 1: and if you don't know Google uses Java.

190
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:35,470
Speaker 1: a lot right.

191
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,020
Speaker 1: Google's Google itself is written already.

192
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:40,219
Speaker 0: You know, this is how it'll be very confusing for people.

193
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,958
Speaker 0: Google uses Java.

194
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:53,700
Speaker 0: Java could refer to the Java programming language the Java runtime The JDK the development any number of specific Java runtime Java SC enterprise, whatever Java, right?

195
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,719
Speaker 1: So Java the language is like this open source language.

196
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:57,883
Speaker 1: Mostly right.

197
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:02,518
Speaker 1: and you know, you can put this all kinds of different JREs and it's not like there's one one.

198
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,951
Speaker 1: That's the one right?

199
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,374
Speaker 1: It's sort of like You know, there's no the C right.

200
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:25,360
Speaker 1: there is a C standard That's like and if you write in C code in the C standard then any C compiler can compile that C right and There is sort of a Java standard and many things, you know sort of follow it, but it's not set in stone, right?

201
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,310
Speaker 1: You know Android the Java is a little different on Android.

202
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:30,819
Speaker 1: It's not exactly the same as the other Java's.

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, now there's also multiple.

204
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,936
Speaker 0: I mean if you install Linux pretty much anywhere you realize the J that Sun Java JRE Java runtime environment is not.

205
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:41,720
Speaker 1: you mean the Oracle?

206
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,502
Speaker 0: Is not Redistributable.

207
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:53,139
Speaker 0: So if you buy install like Ubuntu Java's there and it just works That's some ghetto ass like open source like reimplementation of the JRE.

208
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not the Sun Oracle job.

209
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,420
Speaker 0: And you know what a lot of shit doesn't work on that thing.

210
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:00,114
Speaker 1: This is confusing even for us, right?

211
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:06,000
Speaker 0: I only know as much as I do because My company all of our software is written in Java.

212
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:13,380
Speaker 1: I know as much as I do because even though Java is not my job I did learn it in school and this is something everyone sort of Because it came up in a thread just now in the forum.

213
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:19,471
Speaker 0: I think I should say this right now unless you have a specific reason to use Java Don't install it on your Windows PC.

214
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,379
Speaker 0: It's just or any PC.

215
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:26,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it'll come with words, you know, it's gonna be there already if you install like Ubuntu I guess.

216
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:30,876
Speaker 0: but if you install a Windows PC don't bother with Java unless you have a specific need.

217
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,803
Speaker 0: it's just a security hole That's right.

218
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:41,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, because it means that anyone and you visit someone's web page They can now run Java code on your computer, which is usually safe because there are security restrictions on that.

219
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,126
Speaker 1: But there are often security holes.

220
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,380
Speaker 1: they get announced constantly and that's why Java keeps updating constantly to fix them.

221
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:51,416
Speaker 1: And if you don't update it fast enough and you visit the wrong website now, you're fucked.

222
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:58,244
Speaker 0: Java also like JIT one six has been the standard for pretty much ever lately and It's end of life.

223
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,219
Speaker 0: where they won't support it anymore is real soon like November soon.

224
00:14:01,862 --> 00:14:06,900
Speaker 0: But most stuff doesn't work on one seven because one seven is not compatible with one six in a lot of ways.

225
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:09,980
Speaker 0: But anyway, you can see Java is the thorny mess, right?

226
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,529
Speaker 1: So so Oracle had this fight with Google in court.

227
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:17,480
Speaker 1: They wanted to sue Google for like infringing upon Java copyrights and patents.

228
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:25,242
Speaker 1: Because you know Google made their own sort of Java for Android and such much like the people who made a Jerry for you know Linux.

229
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:30,748
Speaker 1: maybe the people who bought Android made that Java and Google bought them but you know Does a lot of their own Java stuff.

230
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:33,559
Speaker 1: so there's a lot of room there for this to possibly have happened.

231
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:42,162
Speaker 1: So they went in court and it was funny because early on in the case There were these awesome things where they would show like Google, you know They would.

232
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:50,358
Speaker 1: they would ask, you know, Larry Ellison was on the stand But the head of guy of Oracle and they were you may remember being hated by most nerds from the 90s onward.

233
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Google would like at.

234
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:59,920
Speaker 1: the lawyers would ask him questions and then in their presentation They showed videos of him being asked the exact same questions and giving a different answer.

235
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,900
Speaker 1: It was totally a Jon Stewart move in the courtroom, right?

236
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,891
Speaker 1: Where it's like is you know it okay to do this?

237
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,236
Speaker 1: and he'd be like, I'm not sure.

238
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,180
Speaker 1: and then they'd show a video.

239
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:09,647
Speaker 1: Is it okay to do this?

240
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:12,480
Speaker 1: and he in the video he you know for of a previous time and date?

241
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:24,080
Speaker 1: it was the exact same guy saying yes, that is perfectly okay to do that and it's like Okay, so that was pretty much like boom Google's bringing the hammer down in the court and we were feeling pretty good about that.

242
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:27,028
Speaker 0: So how'd that case turn out?

243
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:29,896
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a hundred percent done yet, but it's not.

244
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:32,803
Speaker 1: the look is all good Mario's not happy.

245
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:33,325
Speaker 0: Yep.

246
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:38,203
Speaker 0: Now it was complicated because the jury last week, you know, you can read all the details We're not.

247
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:39,780
Speaker 1: we don't know much about the lawyering.

248
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,300
Speaker 1: We're repeating what we have read elsewhere, but basically the jury came up.

249
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:54,979
Speaker 0: We may send a note to the judge But apparently the jury wasn't even sure among itself whether or not they should send a note to the judge saying look We agree on these things we can't agree on these things.

250
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,597
Speaker 0: What do we do?

251
00:15:57,881 --> 00:16:04,129
Speaker 0: And one thing led to another and they were like, alright, let it go until Monday which is today and then try to make a decision.

252
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,745
Speaker 0: and They mostly made a decision.

253
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,531
Speaker 0: and now Google's move for a mistrial.

254
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:16,300
Speaker 0: the decisions incomplete all sorts of shenanigans But the trial has been partially decided in favor of Oracle.

255
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:22,460
Speaker 1: Well, how can which is pretty bad news because someone gets John's stewarded like that, how can you decide in their favor?

256
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:28,017
Speaker 0: Well the way I see there's one way I can evaluate any case between two big tech companies.

257
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:28,920
Speaker 0: It's very easy.

258
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:35,886
Speaker 0: I put them both on a scale, you know one in each hand and I look at them and say which of these companies Do I hate more Oracle?

259
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:37,792
Speaker 0: Well, then Oracle should lose.

260
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:38,494
Speaker 1: That's right.

261
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:47,704
Speaker 0: And if I hate them both equally I want them both to lose in some sort of like pyrrhic victory King Solomon situation.

262
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,352
Speaker 0: Like I want the situation where yes, you win the fight.

263
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:52,960
Speaker 0: TOS are not enforceable.

264
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:59,516
Speaker 0: I mean if TOS are or are not enforceable in any absolute sense we win.

265
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:00,118
Speaker 0: That's right.

266
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:07,060
Speaker 0: But Yeah, I didn't want Oracle to get anything here because Oracle has been pretty bad for nerds for a long time.

267
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:23,839
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you are nerd This is actually really important and even if you're not a programmer or technology person Even though you should be because otherwise you can be left behind in this futuristic world of high-tech stuff This will come down and affect you especially you millions of Android phone users.

268
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,152
Speaker 1: You know things could happen there.

269
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:27,680
Speaker 1: that could be very bad.

270
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:38,699
Speaker 0: So what it seems to come down to and it's a technicality, but it's one that has far-reaching implications Whether or not APIs are copyrightable.

271
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,254
Speaker 0: now I'm gonna say this right now if the answer from this case ends up being yes, we're fucked.

272
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:54,449
Speaker 0: that is like a huge epic fucking Upon the large majority of programming in America if not the world.

273
00:17:54,769 --> 00:18:00,794
Speaker 0: Yep Independent of that The the case is also being decided.

274
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:04,700
Speaker 0: they basically Agreed that Google violated copyright.

275
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:09,440
Speaker 0: So now Google's trying to argue that they had fair use which was put the part that was undecided.

276
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:12,698
Speaker 0: Oh, well, here's a the official Google statement from Jim Prosser.

277
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:16,136
Speaker 1: We appreciate you the Google chief legal guy, right?

278
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:22,600
Speaker 0: We appreciate I think We appreciate the jury's efforts and we know that fair use and infringement are two sides of the same coin.

279
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:27,100
Speaker 0: The core issue is whether the API's here are copyrightable and that's for the court to decide.

280
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,120
Speaker 0: We expect to prevail on this issue and Oracle's other claims.

281
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,170
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm This is I don't have anything else to say.

282
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,260
Speaker 0: you can read all these details and I'm not a lawyer.

283
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:47,744
Speaker 0: So the more I say I edge toward our lawyer friends calling me and being like no, it's not how it works Mm-hmm It's bad news.

284
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:57,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, the this is far worse in the long run than all that Piracy CISPA CBD tPA kind of stuff you guys complain about.

285
00:18:58,782 --> 00:18:59,405
Speaker 1: Any news from you?

286
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:00,410
Speaker 0: I have some news.

287
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,234
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of little stuff.

288
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,440
Speaker 0: I want to talk about great.

289
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:11,060
Speaker 0: So Verizon's gonna start allowing people on their networks in that over the next year to send a text to 911.

290
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,370
Speaker 1: Hooray.

291
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:21,846
Speaker 0: most of the news coverage I've seen on this are people flipping out and making jokes about texting or saying that Texting is something stupid.

292
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:27,344
Speaker 0: kids do we shouldn't dumb down, you know, basically everyone's arguing that this somehow Trivializes 9-1-1.

293
00:19:27,364 --> 00:19:32,700
Speaker 1: if I have a heart attack and I can't really talk and I need to but I can sort of move my hand.

294
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,604
Speaker 0: What if I'm deaf?

295
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:36,095
Speaker 0: What if I'm witnessing a robbery and if I call?

296
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,200
Speaker 1: no, this is a deaf.

297
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:39,239
Speaker 1: There's a TTY 9-1-1, but still what?

298
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:47,600
Speaker 0: What if I'm witnessing a robbery and if I pick up my phone and go yo dog someone's getting robbed the robber might notice me.

299
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:51,252
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can just text really quickly and discreetly without being noticed.

300
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:52,477
Speaker 1: texting 9-1-1 is awesome.

301
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,067
Speaker 1: I don't know why we don't have it already.

302
00:19:55,087 --> 00:20:00,045
Speaker 1: I know we should have had it a long time ago like Ten plus years ago.

303
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,175
Speaker 1: I'm sure other countries probably have it where everyone texts.

304
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,210
Speaker 0: We should have an email I think - we should have an everything.

305
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,048
Speaker 1: you should be able to use any form of communication available To call 9-1-1 except maybe yelling.

306
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:15,180
Speaker 1: that's a little unreasonable to expect to expect yelling to work.

307
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:18,339
Speaker 0: Well Scott if we let Big Brother have cameras and microphones everywhere

308
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:29,630
Speaker 1: There it we could set up a system where you know if I'm fine if it's on you know Public property where you know somehow you can yell and not help help and 9-1-1 will actually work and figure out Hey someone's.

309
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:38,385
Speaker 1: yeah That might be a stretch Some listening device where you can yell a certain thing and then it will know that someone is yelling that certain thing at this Intersection and then people will be deployed.

310
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:41,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is mocking Jays will happen.

311
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,479
Speaker 0: I know yeah, I don't think we need it.

312
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:46,560
Speaker 0: But all I can say is I think this is great.

313
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:54,680
Speaker 0: I think this should have been a standard decade ago plus and Anyone who trivializes this or tries to argue against it is a moron.

314
00:20:55,621 --> 00:21:00,216
Speaker 0: You know what is one argument anything if you don't so I got it can be made against this.

315
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:08,969
Speaker 1: if you don't want 9-1-1 texting to be a thing then if anyone texts 9-1-1 and they show up and you're one of those people you don't get help They'll just turn around.

316
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:09,193
Speaker 1: go home.

317
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:13,249
Speaker 0: well There is one argument that can be made against this.

318
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:16,100
Speaker 0: I think it's a fairly poor argument, but it can be made.

319
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:17,620
Speaker 0: I just want to get this out here.

320
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:26,039
Speaker 0: so if you think you're against this the only argument you can make is that SMS is by definition unreliable and it's not guaranteed your Message will get anywhere in a timely fashion.

321
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:34,987
Speaker 0: better than my counter argument is one what Scott just said and two if We implement a text to 9-1-1 feature.

322
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:39,440
Speaker 0: We can implement QoS to where if you text 9-1-1 it gets precedence in the network.

323
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:41,447
Speaker 1: We can do that too.

324
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:47,973
Speaker 1: problem solved, you know 9-1-1 texts are a lot like UDP jokes.

325
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:49,560
Speaker 1: I don't care if you get them or not.

326
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,340
Speaker 0: You should have just not said anything and continued.

327
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,665
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I got.

328
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,793
Speaker 0: well, I got one really controversial thing.

329
00:21:56,813 --> 00:22:02,020
Speaker 0: I want to talk about and then Controversy don't do this time on cross geek.

330
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:07,380
Speaker 0: So there was an article on semantics like internet security threat report and a bunch of people have been commenting on it.

331
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:18,913
Speaker 0: the gist of this is that religious and Technological websites have far more security threats per year than Pornographic sites pretty much across the board.

332
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:28,959
Speaker 0: That is not unexpected I know but a lot of people are again mostly non tech people freaking out about this and it harken back to a conversation I had with Emily and some people not that long ago.

333
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:37,620
Speaker 0: I was explaining to a whole bunch of people that The most dangerous websites you can visit in terms of malware are not the scary porn sites.

334
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,519
Speaker 0: It's MIDI files song lyrics and cursors.

335
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:42,500
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

336
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,327
Speaker 1: So basically what it comes down to is obviously whoever did this research if it was real research even and not just a made-up thing Right, but semantics.

337
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:50,234
Speaker 0: so I give it a 50/50 shot, right?

338
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,749
Speaker 1: Is that they only looked at these two categories?

339
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,780
Speaker 1: But in fact, these are just subsets of larger categories.

340
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:05,443
Speaker 1: The fact is this websites run by technology professionals have fewer vulnerabilities than websites set up by some schmo Right.

341
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:09,279
Speaker 1: What do you think sets up the local churches website some?

342
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,253
Speaker 1: Outsores local guy who sets up crappy restaurant.

343
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,740
Speaker 0: Well, I know the security vulnerabilities.

344
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:19,218
Speaker 1: This is actively on some crappy managed hosting running some old ass who knows what.

345
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:25,740
Speaker 0: but this is Actively bad software attacking people who visit the sites injected usually via ads, right?

346
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:35,941
Speaker 1: It's somebody who set up the website set it up real shitty like and then somebody else came and it put Evil things in that site that were you know, not the person who said at the site up the church people didn't put it There.

347
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:39,533
Speaker 1: someone else put it there because the site was so shitty that someone else right.

348
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:48,000
Speaker 1: meanwhile porn sites are run by You know, at least the big ones especially well a friend of ours have to be capable of delivering lots and lots of videos.

349
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,880
Speaker 0: God, you may recall and a certain friend of ours ran a porn site at our IT.

350
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,625
Speaker 0: He was technologically fisticated.

351
00:23:53,705 --> 00:24:07,460
Speaker 1: but most porn sites are run by highly technologically sophisticated people Even if they don't look like they are well porn sites As a business and have a vested interest in not fucking their customers, that's right.

352
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:14,989
Speaker 1: So they definitely want to pop up all kinds of ads on you and shit like that and some of them want to infect You know purposefully infest you with viruses and such.

353
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,603
Speaker 1: but our people who look at porn know which sites are good And which ones aren't good.

354
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:24,400
Speaker 1: and if their site gets all virus there, you know browser gets all virus coming to your site.

355
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:25,878
Speaker 1: They're not gonna come there again.

356
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:39,994
Speaker 0: So I give to you right now a very easy way to tell if a site is likely to be dangerous if it has Universal or very mass appeal to a demographic of people over the age of 45.

357
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:44,840
Speaker 0: Yep, and is something generic and probably non-copyrightable.

358
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:55,791
Speaker 0: If an example a website that has cursors for your computer puppy wallpapers Yep, that puppy wallpapers is probably the worst possible site you could ever visit.

359
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,174
Speaker 1: iPhone wallpapers free.

360
00:24:57,355 --> 00:24:58,157
Speaker 1: iPhone free.

361
00:24:58,277 --> 00:24:59,520
Speaker 0: iPad free anything.

362
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much, you know any song lyrics.

363
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:09,219
Speaker 0: because song lyrics are not you can't just legally put them up because of copyright BS Which I don't want to get into that argument.

364
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:24,964
Speaker 0: so one the only people who post song lyrics in any sort of database or archive are usually overseas and dodgy anyway, and two Song lyrics are super searched for by teeny boppers and older people pretty much any non-technologically savvy people.

365
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:40,800
Speaker 1: pretty much any website that was set up, you know e greeting cards anything that was set up either Intentionally by some you know, you're gonna have the intentional virus, you know Put there by the website creator and the kind of site rim is talking about but also the websites that are run by people who?

366
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:50,954
Speaker 1: Are not technology experts are likely to have the virus put there by someone else who didn't create the website Attacking the website and installing a virus in it that then hits all the visitors.

367
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,640
Speaker 1: So you got to watch out for both kinds.

368
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:00,994
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

369
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:12,615
Speaker 0: a long time ago we had a thing of the day that was a very apt succinct and wonderful explanation of how a Differential gear works like a differential in a car.

370
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:13,640
Speaker 1: That's a great thing of the day.

371
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:26,071
Speaker 0: so in that spirit, I found a very similar video for something a little more complex and I'm not gonna do many more of these but I'm trying to put together a compilation of the best of these and maybe make a tumbler.

372
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:32,240
Speaker 0: So this is a similar explanation made by the military for the military in the u.s.

373
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:34,328
Speaker 0: On how fluid couplings work.

374
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:35,613
Speaker 0: now, you might think Ram.

375
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,500
Speaker 0: Why do I care about a fluid coupling?

376
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,189
Speaker 0: Well, that's how automatic transmissions work sort of.

377
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,599
Speaker 1: I didn't even really know so much about fluid couplings But now I feel like I know everything.

378
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:49,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you ever wonder why you can just have your car idling, you know, I know I don't know everything.

379
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:59,614
Speaker 0: It's a pretty cool video and actually it does a similar job in terms of Demonstrating the principle and then like ramping it up and ramping it up then getting to the real application.

380
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:10,615
Speaker 0: I want to make modern like technological Demonstration explanation videos about complex computer concepts in this style with this narration.

381
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,360
Speaker 1: The thing is you can't it's really hard.

382
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:16,373
Speaker 0: Move the glow to the menu item on the left.

383
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:21,894
Speaker 1: Sure click on the glow All right, so here's another is the thing of the day this thing of the day.

384
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:28,895
Speaker 1: sure this is one of those What's it called super cuts because well, they're easy to grab and this one's pretty great.

385
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:33,896
Speaker 1: This is every Emotional breakdown in all Phoenix Wright games.

386
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:34,640
Speaker 0: Oh, man

387
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:48,634
Speaker 1: every time one of those characters goes doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and they're going oh my god and tearing their hair out or Exploding or pounding their hair against the wall or you know Punching themselves or making crazy faces or their radios that are exploding or whatever.

388
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:50,940
Speaker 1: It's all of those in a big string.

389
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:52,619
Speaker 1: It's pretty epic.

390
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:56,820
Speaker 1: It also spoils all the Phoenix rights, but whatever it doesn't matter.

391
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,479
Speaker 1: It's awesome, and I kind of want to play some Phoenix, right?

392
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,838
Speaker 1: but there hasn't been a new one and I heard the next one's gonna be 3ds only.

393
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:07,976
Speaker 0: so Thing is there's no Phoenix right right now and there's no advance Wars.

394
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:10,223
Speaker 0: So Yeah, whatever.

395
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:12,149
Speaker 1: hey you can relive the olden days.

396
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,805
Speaker 1: maybe remember what Phoenix Wright was all about if you play this shit Let me watch this video.

397
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:22,586
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment this weekend Saturday only though the con is Friday and Saturday.

398
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:24,530
Speaker 0: We will be at Zenkai con.

399
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,900
Speaker 0: We will be there doing two presentations.

400
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:37,412
Speaker 0: we'll be doing how ponies and dude bro can take over the internet at 3 o'clock and then at 530 we'll be doing motivational anime.

401
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:39,000
Speaker 1: ponies haven't already taken over the internet.

402
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:44,234
Speaker 0: When I put this in and suggested it they hadn't completely taken over the internet yet.

403
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:46,340
Speaker 0: Okay now they pretty much have.

404
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:53,754
Speaker 0: And outside of those things we will pretty much be hanging out at the con Playing board games talking to people.

405
00:28:53,774 --> 00:29:00,006
Speaker 0: if you want to say hi This is pretty much your best con to actually come up to us and say hi Ask Scott for an autograph.

406
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:00,689
Speaker 0: He loves that shit.

407
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,211
Speaker 1: No sure.

408
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:02,597
Speaker 1: I don't know why you'd want it.

409
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,160
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

410
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:09,840
Speaker 1: So that the book club book is 1 q 8 4 by Haruki Murakami.

411
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:12,113
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if is.

412
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:15,009
Speaker 1: Is it supposed to be 1 q 8 4 1 q 84 or?

413
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,451
Speaker 0: Why don't you tell me you teen 84 or?

414
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:33,840
Speaker 1: 1,000 q hundred and eighty four Right, but whatever You should read it because the book club book also Recent book club books have been relatively small and short.

415
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:38,456
Speaker 1: This is a long manly book or womanly book.

416
00:29:38,717 --> 00:29:39,660
Speaker 1: It is for adults.

417
00:29:40,464 --> 00:29:42,716
Speaker 1: It is like 900 something pages hard babies.

418
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:43,580
Speaker 1: That's right, baby.

419
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:53,898
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Read a book not a sports page or a magazine or young adult novel or you should read I want my hat back But don't make that the only thing you read.

420
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:59,875
Speaker 1: That's actually sort of less than a sports page also in July better than a sports page in July.

421
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:00,598
Speaker 0: Connecticut.

422
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:02,525
Speaker 0: in Hartford, Connecticut We run the panels workshops.

423
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:05,720
Speaker 0: department submissions are pretty much closed and full.

424
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,926
Speaker 0: But if you have a really good idea for a panel workshop or a lecture Go ahead and submit it on the website.

425
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:11,929
Speaker 0: If it's good enough.

426
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,795
Speaker 0: I might bite bump something.

427
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,440
Speaker 0: I've already tentatively scheduled.

428
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:20,093
Speaker 0: However, every hour that you wait means it's less likely I will accept your submission.

429
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:26,119
Speaker 0: All right, and if you submit it After May well, you're not getting in pretty much no matter what happens.

430
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:30,516
Speaker 1: Also, I've mentioned in a while, you know, we are on the internet.

431
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:31,340
Speaker 1: The internet is the thing.

432
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:32,752
Speaker 1: We are very internet people.

433
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:33,600
Speaker 1: we're on there.

434
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:45,667
Speaker 1: So if you have Facebook or Google+ or Twitter or just website RSS or iTunes or any other thing you can imagine We are on that thing.

435
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:49,120
Speaker 1: There's even some fan even made like a Windows 7 app, right?

436
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:56,699
Speaker 1: So if you like geek nights, you should get whatever thing geek nights is follow like whatever it is.

437
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:58,124
Speaker 1: Do that if you want to.

438
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:02,660
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna make you and I just want to make kind of a super meta note.

439
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:14,678
Speaker 0: we recorded a little bit ahead because I'm going to Turkey for a while and In the upcoming Tuesday episode we say something to the effect of you should have bought a packs badge And if you didn't well, haha.

440
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:20,539
Speaker 0: But we may recorded that episode before the badges went back online and sold out within like an hour.

441
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:27,296
Speaker 0: So it sounds a little mean they were not sold out as of the time when we did that show.

442
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:29,968
Speaker 1: just saying but our advice Still stands.

443
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:36,400
Speaker 1: if you wanted a packs badge You should have listened to our advice and bought one immediately and I don't know why people don't listen to our advice.

444
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:41,500
Speaker 0: Apparently this time the problem is people did listen to our advice and as a result packed sold out immediately.

445
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,918
Speaker 1: But there were still other people who did not listen to our advice and then complain.

446
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:48,936
Speaker 0: Scott If it sells out immediately then enough people have heeded the advice.

447
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:49,839
Speaker 0: to where that's it?

448
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:56,908
Speaker 1: You have to heed the advice of being just like us and being attached to the internet all the time so that you are the First guy no matter what.

449
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:58,380
Speaker 0: Ah, that doesn't always work.

450
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:07,060
Speaker 0: I point out that Otacon and kinetic ons artist allies, even if you are sitting there Manually running was watching a w get scrubbed constantly refreshing.

451
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:11,760
Speaker 0: You might not get one once it goes live because the sheer number of people trying to get one and limited quantity.

452
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:19,752
Speaker 1: I guess we have a lot of practice registering for classes at RIT so I would try to bring SAS or whatever.

453
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:20,716
Speaker 0: It was called down.

454
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,660
Speaker 0: Here's what I should do.

455
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,699
Speaker 0: I said I tried to sin flood it one year so I could crash it hoping that by the time it rebooted I'd be the only one still trying.

456
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:34,167
Speaker 1: So what you should do is you should practice doing something like buying concert tickets on Ticketmaster or some shit like that And you can actually make.

457
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:35,837
Speaker 1: there's a lot of people do that as their job, right?

458
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:48,399
Speaker 0: We should do this on a Tuesday show but I'll put it bluntly or easily if you want to get badges or artist alley tables Or anything like this find out what the maxes you can get and have a bunch of friends who are watching.

459
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,219
Speaker 0: if Any one of you gets in first have an agreement that you will buy the max for your friends.

460
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:59,680
Speaker 0: Hmm now if and as soon as you do this immediately, you know tweet and call your friends milk.

461
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:00,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got him.

462
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:01,164
Speaker 0: Did you get him?

463
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:08,451
Speaker 0: and on the off chance that you get some extras and because it's so hard to get them It's unlikely that all of you will get a full loadout of extras.

464
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:11,440
Speaker 1: Even if you do you can easily sell them.

465
00:33:11,761 --> 00:33:18,524
Speaker 0: Yep, you should probably sell them at list price or you're slightly douchey Depends it's got.

466
00:33:18,644 --> 00:33:19,749
Speaker 0: it's okay to scalp.

467
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:25,059
Speaker 0: However in a technical sense However, you're being a dick when you do it for an event like packs.

468
00:33:26,401 --> 00:33:28,692
Speaker 1: I think that's just because the past community pushes down on you.

469
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,400
Speaker 1: I actually don't have any moral problem with it.

470
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:35,674
Speaker 1: You purchase a good that is in high demand and low supply and you own that good.

471
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:49,340
Speaker 1: and is your transfer right to transfer that Good, you should get the maximum money you can get for that good, but Scott I have the alternate argument that packs is deeply artificially discounted for a lot of specific reasons.

472
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:51,867
Speaker 1: It's not my problem.

473
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:52,589
Speaker 0: So you didn't.

474
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,119
Speaker 0: I said it's perfectly morally okay to do it.

475
00:33:55,381 --> 00:34:00,839
Speaker 1: However, you're kind of a dick if you do it Stupid if you don't because you just gave away a bunch of free money.

476
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:11,475
Speaker 1: I was if I had an extra pegs badge I just give it away to someone who really needed it might give it away in a contest or Something, you know, but I definitely wouldn't just sell it at list price.

477
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:12,478
Speaker 1: That'd be bleh lame.

478
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:15,228
Speaker 0: Well, I would sell it to someone I knew at list price.

479
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:22,480
Speaker 0: Maybe give it away to someone I knew a little better maybe But anyway, so this was your show your idea, right?

480
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,431
Speaker 1: So I feel like we've discussed this on the show as do

481
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:26,572
Speaker 0: I in

482
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:37,838
Speaker 1: the past but despite great amounts of searching I could not find a show on this specific topic on its own even though I think we've discussed parts of subsets of it You know, which we will rediscuss today.

483
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:45,835
Speaker 1: Also, if we even if we did the show, I don't think it was very well listened to or remembered It's an interesting topic and we have no other Monday ideas.

484
00:34:46,158 --> 00:35:03,700
Speaker 1: So Let us discuss security vulnerabilities, but specifically security vulnerabilities in websites and to people who visit websites since that is most of what would people do with computers these days and the vast majority Of security problems in the world these days are these kinds now?

485
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,682
Speaker 0: We're not gonna talk about stuff that is related to that but not kind of germane like for example Trojans.

486
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:13,532
Speaker 0: if you download if you download an executable file and run it with elevated privileges.

487
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:14,575
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

488
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:17,174
Speaker 0: You're already too far gone It doesn't matter.

489
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:20,680
Speaker 1: That's it Alright, so let's let's just get right into it, right?

490
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,860
Speaker 1: so the first thing which I definitely know we've discussed on the show in the past is Injection attacks SQL injection, right?

491
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:36,734
Speaker 0: Usually SQL injection, but could there could be other injections, you know, Johnny Single per single quote drop tables.

492
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:37,618
Speaker 1: That's right.

493
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,900
Speaker 1: So let's say, you know, you've got this website and there's a search on the website.

494
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:46,132
Speaker 1: So if you type in I want to search for geek nights, right?

495
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:47,597
Speaker 1: What does the server do?

496
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:48,160
Speaker 1: it says?

497
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:57,228
Speaker 1: Select from the table where the disc title contains the word geek nights Quote semicolon.

498
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,159
Speaker 1: Well, what if instead of typing in geek nights you type in?

499
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:09,500
Speaker 1: geek nights quote semicolon Select drop drop tables drop Right all kinds of other evil things.

500
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:25,300
Speaker 1: Well now what happens is the web server takes that and instead of you know Normally put the word geek nights it now puts the word geek nights and also a whole bunch of other evil stuff And it actually does all the evil stuff because it's a stupidly written web application.

501
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:27,212
Speaker 0: so how do we get around this?

502
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:35,072
Speaker 1: because this is a Surprisingly large number of websites are still affected by this In fact, most of those shitty ones run by churches and such.

503
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:37,460
Speaker 0: it's for certain kinds of input.

504
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:46,411
Speaker 0: It's very easy to sanitize your input But a lot of the obvious ways to sanitize or clean up input are Relying upon things like JavaScript.

505
00:36:46,693 --> 00:36:52,060
Speaker 0: like in the browser It'll see you type like commas and things and remove them or encapsulate.

506
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:59,580
Speaker 1: Yeah That doesn't work because I don't have to run that JavaScript Exiled to say yeah disable the JavaScript or I'll just won't even visit your website in my browser.

507
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,097
Speaker 1: I'll just use curl and send stuff to your server.

508
00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:04,748
Speaker 1: Yep All your security.

509
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,860
Speaker 1: you need super security on the back and the front.

510
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,991
Speaker 1: You can't rely on the front to protect the back or the back to protect what.

511
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:13,038
Speaker 0: there's a particular one for XML.

512
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:25,328
Speaker 0: It's called like the million lulls or the billion lulls Where if you're if someone's sending you XML you can define XML such that it'll basically expand and take up all your RAM while you try to parse it Mm-hmm.

513
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:31,500
Speaker 0: And how do you validate against that if it's a relatively small set of XML in terms of number of characters?

514
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:33,746
Speaker 0: That and you're expecting XML.

515
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:34,148
Speaker 0: Yep.

516
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:43,142
Speaker 1: See when you write a website, you've got these two parts the JavaScript part in the browser in the HTML and the CSS and the server and these are actually You.

517
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:49,252
Speaker 1: you have to consider these things to be two programs that talk to each other Right and they where it is.

518
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,600
Speaker 0: It's called the billion laughs.

519
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:52,880
Speaker 0: It has a whole Wikipedia page dedicated to it.

520
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,166
Speaker 1: Both of these applications have to be secure.

521
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:55,888
Speaker 1: and what's?

522
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:57,492
Speaker 1: to make it even more complicated?

523
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:10,567
Speaker 1: that front end that HTML JavaScript CSS Application is written is partially rewritten by the server and then so the server actually Generates a program Even though some of it isn't generated.

524
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:21,222
Speaker 1: but it generates a program sends that program to your browser Your browser runs that program that program then talks to the server which then generates more programs and sends them to your browser to be Executed.

525
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:22,670
Speaker 1: it's crazy.

526
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,720
Speaker 1: And that's why it's hard to get exactly right.

527
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:47,028
Speaker 1: but if you use a modern web framework instead of just writing your website from scratch or if you actually have technologically intelligent people writing your website This is Injection is so easy to not have because what just happens is every single quote that's coming over the line Gets back slashes in front of it the correct number of them and then the back slashes are removed at the appropriate times and added At the appropriate times.

528
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:48,480
Speaker 1: It's a solved problem.

529
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:59,360
Speaker 1: And if you do that Then if someone tries to search for geek nights blah blah blah drop tables Then what will happen is they'll find every article that has the words geek nights drop tables blah blah blah in it.

530
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:02,560
Speaker 1: They won't find any articles and nothing bad will happen.

531
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,027
Speaker 0: I guess the point is to simplify it.

532
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,425
Speaker 0: if you're trying to catch all these things on your own by thinking about them You're gonna miss something.

533
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:11,410
Speaker 1: you're doing it wrong.

534
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:20,880
Speaker 0: You've got to use a framework like there are XML Validation engines whose sole job is to validate XML based on other schema you define to figure out.

535
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,953
Speaker 1: All of these problems have been solved and if you try to solve them again on your own You will fail in some aspect.

536
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:34,540
Speaker 1: most of the time these Vulnerabilities are cosmic people using old software or their own software instead of the tried-and-true software.

537
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,728
Speaker 1: Right and not updating it or something.

538
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:37,671
Speaker 0: Scott this billion laughs.

539
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,940
Speaker 0: XML bomb is actually pretty funny now that I'm looking at it.

540
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, entity lol has a test string of lol.

541
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:43,923
Speaker 0: Entity lol.

542
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:47,233
Speaker 0: one is a set of ten instances of lol.

543
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:47,915
Speaker 0: lol.

544
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:55,260
Speaker 0: two is ten instances of lol one Etc till you've got like nine of these and then it's just lol nine in lol's tags.

545
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:56,265
Speaker 1: That's right.

546
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:56,931
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

547
00:39:57,032 --> 00:40:02,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Whatever you do and you're making a website make sure you use things that our people have written.

548
00:40:03,054 --> 00:40:05,582
Speaker 1: use open SSH use open SSL.

549
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:14,090
Speaker 1: use some framework like Ruby on Rails or Django or you know symphony or any of those web frameworks that already has a bunch of code written.

550
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:25,465
Speaker 0: so Scott a buzzword that is out there a lot and We once a long time got a forum that was actually vulnerable to this sort of thing is cross scripting attacks Cross-site scripting attacks.

551
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:28,073
Speaker 0: Well, you can have interest site scripting attacks.

552
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,055
Speaker 0: Like we had two forums.

553
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:29,737
Speaker 1: Oh you could.

554
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:30,760
Speaker 1: yeah, we had two forums.

555
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,727
Speaker 0: They're both vanilla a long long time ago.

556
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:36,280
Speaker 0: You guys probably wouldn't even know that other forum that we ran.

557
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:50,973
Speaker 0: But and it's not the one that had the old geek nights on it It's a third other old forum, but I digress they were on the same site But they were both vanilla and it was pretty trivial Taking a cookie from one to get access to stuff.

558
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,940
Speaker 0: You shouldn't have gotten on the other one by making user.

559
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:54,846
Speaker 1: Well, that's actually slightly different.

560
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:58,840
Speaker 1: That is a subset of a cross-site scripting attack known as the cross-site request forgery.

561
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:00,489
Speaker 1: It is but I'll get to that.

562
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,260
Speaker 1: Let us talk about cross-site scripting attack, right?

563
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:09,646
Speaker 1: So every web browser every major web browser at least and you would be stupid not to use a major web browser Has this thing called.

564
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:13,699
Speaker 1: I think it's that only the exact word for it, but basically it's the same domain.

565
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,524
Speaker 1: Guarantee, right?

566
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,232
Speaker 1: I think there's an actual term for it.

567
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:20,382
Speaker 1: But basically what it does is Firefox.

568
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:26,720
Speaker 1: let's say you have Firefox right and you go to a website and that website includes some JavaScripts from some other website.

569
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:33,920
Speaker 1: Those JavaScripts on the other website aren't going to be allowed to really do anything because they're from some other website.

570
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:36,920
Speaker 1: They're gonna be severely limited if not completely disabled.

571
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:40,180
Speaker 1: Right because it only trusts things from the website that you're on.

572
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:48,299
Speaker 1: So if you're on google.com and there's some shady JavaScripts trying to load from front-recruiter.com Your browser is just not even gonna do those JavaScripts.

573
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,740
Speaker 1: They're just not gonna happen because obviously that's a no-no, right?

574
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:57,560
Speaker 1: And even if let's say the JavaScript that Google gives you tries to do something to front-recruiter.com, right?

575
00:41:57,941 --> 00:42:04,306
Speaker 1: So the Google JavaScript tries to grab the front page of front-recruiter.com and load it up That's probably not gonna work.

576
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:05,189
Speaker 1: Right?

577
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:05,711
Speaker 0: So it's got.

578
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:07,195
Speaker 0: why do we block this sort of thing?

579
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,460
Speaker 0: Like why do browsers block it?

580
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,060
Speaker 1: Because then it would be it would be trivially easy to do all sorts of evil goodies.

581
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:17,840
Speaker 0: For example, well here I visit my Facebook and I got a cookie.

582
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,700
Speaker 0: I'm authenticated and then I visit a bad website and it runs JavaScript that figures that I'm logged into Facebook and at least my profile.

583
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:25,876
Speaker 1: Yep, that can happen.

584
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:26,159
Speaker 1: BAM.

585
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:29,380
Speaker 1: So how does one of these things actually get through?

586
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,780
Speaker 1: Well, there are ways to do this on purpose that work like such as JSONP and I'm not gonna go into the details of that.

587
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,972
Speaker 1: But basically it's let's say I have two domains.

588
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:40,497
Speaker 1: They both belong to me.

589
00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:41,200
Speaker 1: I own them.

590
00:42:41,623 --> 00:42:43,280
Speaker 1: I want one of them to hit the other one.

591
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:51,720
Speaker 1: So let's say I own Twitter and I own front-recruiter.com and I want you when you visit front-recruiter.com To have like this little Twitter thing happening in the middle of the page.

592
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:54,360
Speaker 1: I need to be able to have the JavaScript talk to twitter.com.

593
00:42:55,022 --> 00:43:00,600
Speaker 1: I can make it happen if I jump through the right hoops legit-like and that's okay.

594
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:06,060
Speaker 1: But those same hoops can be sometimes forced Unlegit, and that's not okay.

595
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:14,240
Speaker 1: So usually the way this happens is let's say you got a forum right and someone makes a post in the forum And they post some JavaScript in their forum post.

596
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:22,960
Speaker 1: Usually the forum should be removing the JavaScript from the forum post But sometimes an old stupid PHP VV from 100 years ago isn't gonna do that.

597
00:43:23,282 --> 00:43:28,556
Speaker 0: yep, like it'll have a blacklist of things you can't use and Blacklists don't work for security.

598
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:28,940
Speaker 0: No kidding.

599
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:39,368
Speaker 1: So what happens is now everyone else who reads that forum thread This JavaScript that they're getting is actually coming from the same domain as the forum Which mean that JavaScript can do what it wants.

600
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,731
Speaker 1: and now that JavaScript is a no-good JavaScript that I put there Not the person who made the forum.

601
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:50,120
Speaker 1: JavaScript doesn't care That's right, so now suddenly it's doing all sorts of nasty shit.

602
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,732
Speaker 1: So everyone who visits this website is executing this bad bad JavaScript Vulnerabilities like that happened in the earlier days of Facebook.

603
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,920
Speaker 0: They've happened in a lot of mediocre forums.

604
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:01,076
Speaker 0: There were things.

605
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:10,364
Speaker 1: yeah Even the biggest websites are vulnerable to this shit and you have to be extra super careful Right not to have it now If you don't know better.

606
00:44:10,645 --> 00:44:21,700
Speaker 0: again aside from using you know standard platforms and protocols and using like real frameworks Generally don't let people use anything other than basic HTML on anything public.

607
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:26,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is why you'll see on a lot of websites like Wikipedia makes you write things in wiki language.

608
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:30,500
Speaker 0: And well, that's also because wiki language is kind of standard and it's not what I'm saying.

609
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,088
Speaker 1: It's that you've got other websites.

610
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,320
Speaker 1: they you know, they don't let you comment in HTML.

611
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,870
Speaker 1: they make you use pH, you know the BB code or some other kind of language or markdown or something like that.

612
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:51,600
Speaker 1: because You know the parsers for those languages will remove all sorts of evilness and you won't be able to type any JavaScripts or HTMLs in those through those parsers and actually get it made to the other end.

613
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:58,120
Speaker 1: You're just limited to the things that a user should be limited to like bold make a link Make it put an image there and that sort of thing.

614
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,224
Speaker 1: You can't do anything else.

615
00:44:59,765 --> 00:45:04,280
Speaker 1: if you're allowed to freely post HTML and JavaScript you could put all sorts of evilness in there.

616
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:05,909
Speaker 0: So what about?

617
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:07,579
Speaker 0: because a common?

618
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:15,878
Speaker 0: Problem or a common place people get malware is not websites themselves, but the ads hosted on those websites bought from shady people.

619
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:18,362
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You can't.

620
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:23,600
Speaker 0: protecting against those is pretty much the same as protecting against, you know actual problems on the right side itself.

621
00:45:23,741 --> 00:45:34,959
Speaker 1: This is number one reason right if you're a web user Even if you are one of those people who really believes that you should look at ads because it makes money for the person You should use adblock to protect yourself from evil.

622
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:40,616
Speaker 1: And here's why right a lot of people run a website and they run ads, but they don't.

623
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:46,232
Speaker 1: actually some people You know manually sell their ads like go arcade like penny arcade.

624
00:45:46,252 --> 00:45:59,311
Speaker 1: penny arcade says send us a JPEG and we will make an ad For you, but other people just say, you know they might use an ad network and that and then people will bid on that ad network and put ads on this person's website and That person doesn't even know what those ads are.

625
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:05,020
Speaker 1: They just put a spot on their website They sell that spot to someone and then ads just appear there.

626
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:07,060
Speaker 1: They don't don't even know what ads are gonna be there.

627
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,045
Speaker 1: They come from somewhere.

628
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,758
Speaker 0: if you are running a website do not do that.

629
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,804
Speaker 0: No this is trivial to get around.

630
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:18,663
Speaker 0: only get ads from like Google Adsense or something reasonably safe and even then Google Adsense could be Compromised.

631
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:25,289
Speaker 0: it could be but at least if you go with a legitimate ad provider You're probably a lot less likely to get caught.

632
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:34,318
Speaker 0: and if you get caught you're in the same boat as a thousand other people Right, but if you get some shady porn guy or some shady religious website guy or online gambling.

633
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:39,580
Speaker 1: Yep What's gonna happen is basically a web advertisement spot like that, right?

634
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,375
Speaker 1: A lot of them have JavaScript and flash and all these things.

635
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:46,972
Speaker 1: they need to work Right or tracking so that they know how many users visited the ad.

636
00:46:46,992 --> 00:46:53,797
Speaker 1: so the ads that are on your site get all these privileges That normally they would not get because they need those things for the ads to function because they have.

637
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:58,100
Speaker 1: you know They're very, you know functionality wise they're very interactive and all this kind of stuff.

638
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,860
Speaker 1: So some guy puts an ad on your website in that spot that you open to the world that anyone could buy.

639
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:14,098
Speaker 1: He buys it with money legitimately and in that spot He puts some nasty JavaScripts and flashes and those flashes do all sorts of evil things to everyone who visits your site and loads that ad.

640
00:47:14,138 --> 00:47:16,098
Speaker 1: and now You look like a bad guy.

641
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:18,166
Speaker 1: But really you're just dumb.

642
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:19,651
Speaker 1: and you sold your ads.

643
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:22,480
Speaker 1: you sold part of your website to someone and they put bad news there.

644
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:25,275
Speaker 1: That's like saying hey, I got a banana stand.

645
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:28,750
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what, dude I'll only make 75% of the bananas the rest of the 25% of the banana.

646
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,346
Speaker 1: You can fill that in with whatever you want.

647
00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:33,631
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm gonna fill it with cyanide.

648
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:34,976
Speaker 1: Hahahaha.

649
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:35,539
Speaker 1: That's what happens.

650
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:45,660
Speaker 1: So yeah before I was mentioning the cross site request forgery Which is sort of a subset of the cross site scripting attack, right?

651
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:53,646
Speaker 1: it's sometimes pronounced CSRF because that is or XSRF or CSRF or People call it all kinds of things.

652
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:57,740
Speaker 1: I tend to say the whole thing and basically here's how it works.

653
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,840
Speaker 1: Right when you visit a website you get this session, right?

654
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,407
Speaker 1: And that's how you sort of stay logged in.

655
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:05,952
Speaker 0: remember the OSI model.

656
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,155
Speaker 0: We talked about years ago.

657
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:07,717
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

658
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:10,699
Speaker 0: It's in that You can guess where based on the names.

659
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:13,060
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's right.

660
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:19,200
Speaker 1: So what happens is is that you go to one website and you sort of have a session there, right?

661
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:30,136
Speaker 1: And you you know make a request to that website get and your browser will only you know Allow it to see cookies that that website's allowed to see including your session cookie and such like that.

662
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,478
Speaker 1: All right So you go to some other website, right?

663
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:49,660
Speaker 1: And this website, you know will be able to trick You or your browser into thinking that you're actually visiting Website 2 and then do things as if you're visiting website 2 and as if you were logged into website 2, right?

664
00:48:50,140 --> 00:49:00,180
Speaker 1: So this my website like my browser has a Facebook session cookie and Facebook It only allows facebook.com to see that session cookie, right?

665
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,090
Speaker 1: So this means that if it wants to do something as me on Facebook this other website can't do that because it can't see that cookie.

666
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:10,156
Speaker 1: It's not allowed to see that cookie, right?

667
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:11,360
Speaker 1: No permissions.

668
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:16,736
Speaker 1: but What happens is someone did this vulnerability a while back.

669
00:49:16,756 --> 00:49:17,400
Speaker 1: It was very clever.

670
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:19,829
Speaker 1: They load a little iframe and in that iframe is Facebook.

671
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:22,940
Speaker 1: So then that iframe is basically a whole nother web page, right?

672
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:26,491
Speaker 1: Okay So that little tiny iframe is a lot.

673
00:49:26,552 --> 00:49:28,380
Speaker 1: as gets my Facebook session ID.

674
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:35,091
Speaker 1: This still doesn't really help them though because Facebook's in the iframe They can't really get anything in there or get anything out of there.

675
00:49:35,131 --> 00:49:36,376
Speaker 1: so much, right?

676
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:41,420
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay It's no different than really if I loaded Facebook in another tab and their website in another tab.

677
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:45,795
Speaker 1: They can't really do anything on my behalf on Facebook, right?

678
00:49:46,397 --> 00:50:00,680
Speaker 1: Well, actually they can sort of use JavaScript to force you to click in that little area or They can do a JavaScript like hey if he clicks here move his mouse and then click and do stuff like that.

679
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,980
Speaker 0: So now the old horrible windows days of things that would have a window that popped up.

680
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,133
Speaker 0: You could never get the close button.

681
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:06,760
Speaker 0: That's right.

682
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,613
Speaker 1: So they could do that to you.

683
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:13,471
Speaker 1: and now suddenly You've clicked on this like button that you didn't even know was there.

684
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:17,803
Speaker 1: that was in an iframe and suddenly you'd like something different That you didn't know you liked.

685
00:50:18,064 --> 00:50:23,100
Speaker 1: you think you clicked this like button, but you actually clicked that like button.

686
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,570
Speaker 1: Oh No Right, there's other things that you can do.

687
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:40,494
Speaker 1: For example, like you could send someone an email Alright, and then in the email would be something evil, but they read that email with webmail Alright, and now so you're on gmail.com.

688
00:50:40,595 --> 00:50:41,480
Speaker 1: There's an email there.

689
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,879
Speaker 1: Gmail is very smart about removing this kind of evil stuff.

690
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:59,600
Speaker 1: But let's say you're using a bad another one like, you know squirrel mail or something, you know, you go there and You know, there's something evil in the email that's now running on the domain of the your web email provider.

691
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:04,143
Speaker 1: bad news bad news Right.

692
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:10,219
Speaker 1: You've also got to worry about things such as you know images right like you're allowed to hotlink images.

693
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:15,406
Speaker 0: Yeah, Google image search is actually kind of Dangerous in some ways though.

694
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:23,927
Speaker 0: It's gotten better because a lot of if you search for generic things It'll one take you to websites full of crazy malware And to the images themselves.

695
00:51:23,988 --> 00:51:27,580
Speaker 0: if you click on the link could have bad stuff around them.

696
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:29,266
Speaker 1: But here's the real trick right?

697
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:32,960
Speaker 1: So the way browsers work is if there's an image tag, right?

698
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,545
Speaker 1: It doesn't care if it's from a different domain.

699
00:51:34,585 --> 00:51:35,147
Speaker 1: it loads that.

700
00:51:35,649 --> 00:51:38,820
Speaker 1: if I do IMG SRC equals google.com.

701
00:51:39,483 --> 00:51:47,300
Speaker 1: You're not gonna see anything on the web page where that image is supposed to be But the browser is still gonna load google.com even though I visited frontrecruit.com.

702
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:49,554
Speaker 0: Now the simplest exploit there is really simple.

703
00:51:49,594 --> 00:51:50,117
Speaker 0: you can you.

704
00:51:50,137 --> 00:52:01,236
Speaker 0: for example You could find out if someone visited a page By making a or find out their IP address or find out all sorts of things by having an image Somewhere that they will load and then you see the IP it was loaded from.

705
00:52:01,297 --> 00:52:01,900
Speaker 0: you know was loaded.

706
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:12,571
Speaker 1: So for example, I can go into your forum right and I can do IMG SRC equals Facebook.com slash a whole bunch of stuff like frontrecruit.com slash.

707
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:20,233
Speaker 1: so now anyone who visits that page who is logged into Facebook Upon loading that image in quotes, right?

708
00:52:20,314 --> 00:52:21,720
Speaker 1: They will actually be liking me.

709
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:23,566
Speaker 1: Everyone who visit that page likes me.

710
00:52:23,686 --> 00:52:25,372
Speaker 0: now browsers aren't that stupid.

711
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,659
Speaker 1: They're not that stupid as it used to be but it's still.

712
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:29,348
Speaker 1: It could happen.

713
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you have to be more clever about it.

714
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:32,867
Speaker 0: You can't just be like IMG.

715
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:35,117
Speaker 0: SRC equals link to my like button and it'll work.

716
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:48,580
Speaker 1: It won't work Yep, but basically it's you're trying to trick the browser into somehow Using or telling you about cookies from other domains that don't belong to you so that you know.

717
00:52:48,760 --> 00:53:08,848
Speaker 1: frontrecruit.com tricks your browser into telling it your Facebook session ID Now or getting your browser to use that session ID on its behalf and what happens is now Frontrecruit.com can basically do anything you could do when you were logged into Facebook and pretend to be you on Facebook post tweet Whatever it's gonna do and it's bad news

718
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:11,980
Speaker 0: now in terms of visiting websites and then I guess we can wrap this up.

719
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,743
Speaker 0: We've gone on a while.

720
00:53:12,824 --> 00:53:25,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was you know, the brouhaha some time ago about fire sheep but basically it came down to the fact that in the old days you had a hub or a big like shared land where you Could see other people's traffic and sniffing other people's traffic.

721
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:31,129
Speaker 0: if it's not encrypted It's trivial to get their credentials and authenticate and do whatever you want Mm-hmm.

722
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:36,200
Speaker 0: So we moved to mostly switch networks and then that ceased to be a problem.

723
00:53:36,824 --> 00:53:39,320
Speaker 0: But then we started having public Wi-Fi everywhere.

724
00:53:40,082 --> 00:53:42,109
Speaker 0: Public Wi-Fi is like one of those big public lands.

725
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:45,160
Speaker 0: You can see what people are sending and if they encrypt their stuff.

726
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:51,980
Speaker 0: In most implementations you can also see that stuff because you're using similar cryptography to connect to the same.

727
00:53:52,243 --> 00:53:53,358
Speaker 1: Well if they encrypt it, right?

728
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,245
Speaker 1: So there's different encryptions are talking about here.

729
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:59,160
Speaker 0: So if they're using wire like encryption at the access point then Y can see it.

730
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,175
Speaker 1: We're all connected to the same Wi-Fi and we're all using WPA.

731
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:04,400
Speaker 1: that is encryption.

732
00:54:04,923 --> 00:54:08,440
Speaker 1: Right and you need that passphrase to get connected to the router to encrypt things properly.

733
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,280
Speaker 0: But if I go one step further and I'm using SSL, I'm safe because I have my own layer of encryption, right?

734
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,647
Speaker 1: So it's actually encrypted twice.

735
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:17,340
Speaker 1: It's encrypted with SSL and then it's encrypted with WPA.

736
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:27,219
Speaker 1: So if you decrypt the WPA, which you can do because you're on the same Wi-Fi You know how to decrypt that you end up with a whole bunch of ink stuff That's encrypted by SSL that you can't decrypt and you go fuck me.

737
00:54:27,541 --> 00:54:48,950
Speaker 0: So the reason I bring this up is very simple if you're on any sort of public wireless or untrusted network don't visit websites that have authentication that don't use SSL and if you get a warning about a certificate from a major site like Amazon or Google I doubt their actual certificate is bad You're probably being attacked.

738
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:54,251
Speaker 1: In fact, if you get a warning about a bad certificate ever You should not visit that website period.

739
00:54:54,512 --> 00:54:56,640
Speaker 1: Well, what about if it's a site that you're logged into?

740
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,351
Speaker 0: What about a self-signed certificate from a?

741
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:02,557
Speaker 1: you are the person who did it and you know it.

742
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:03,339
Speaker 1: then you can do it.

743
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,399
Speaker 1: or if It's like your friend and you know, they did it.

744
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:08,312
Speaker 0: What if it's a dodgy site that you know is dodgy?

745
00:55:08,413 --> 00:55:09,156
Speaker 0: if it's done.

746
00:55:09,196 --> 00:55:09,980
Speaker 1: Why are you going there?

747
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,793
Speaker 0: It's well say it's a dodgy site or it's a site that doesn't.

748
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:13,738
Speaker 1: don't go there.

749
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:16,710
Speaker 0: It's dodgy Yeah, but you don't care if you get to it.

750
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,675
Speaker 0: You just want to access it.

751
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:18,660
Speaker 1: virtual machine.

752
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,461
Speaker 0: Accepting that self-signed certificate in most cases will not hurt you unless the site you accepted it from tries to fuck you Mm-hmm.

753
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,187
Speaker 1: I think the last thing is that you know, I just tried this thing out.

754
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:31,990
Speaker 1: It's the Pirate Bay offers it.

755
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:32,768
Speaker 1: It's called I predator.

756
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:35,957
Speaker 1: It costs $22 or three months.

757
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:40,430
Speaker 1: It's a different price in Europe, but whatever and the way it works is this it's a VPN.

758
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,766
Speaker 1: So you get a username and a password and you connect to the VPN.

759
00:55:44,806 --> 00:56:02,150
Speaker 1: you can connect from your phone You can connect from your computer you can connect whatever and this will encrypt all of your internet traffic Period all of it and it will basically make a connection between your computer All the way to the Pirate Bay's computer the I predator computer and it'll be encrypted the entire way and then the I predator computer.

760
00:56:02,874 --> 00:56:05,590
Speaker 1: The rest of the connection will be from there to wherever it's going.

761
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:16,030
Speaker 1: So if you don't use SSL, right, for example, if I just visit frontrecruit.com, which is not SSL protected It would be in my traffic would be encrypted from me all the way up to the Pirate Bay computer.

762
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:23,750
Speaker 1: Then it would be as normal From that computer to frontrecruit.com and then as normal back to the and then can crypt it all the way back to me.

763
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:28,241
Speaker 0: Now I point out there is one potential vulnerability here.

764
00:56:28,582 --> 00:56:30,848
Speaker 0: You have to trust the Pirate Bay.

765
00:56:30,868 --> 00:56:31,650
Speaker 0: That's right.

766
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:32,418
Speaker 1: I think I trust them.

767
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:37,045
Speaker 1: I trust him pretty well Right, but basically if you don't trust them even my SSL stuff.

768
00:56:37,086 --> 00:56:37,970
Speaker 1: Okay, so use SSL.

769
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:46,869
Speaker 1: It's encrypted triply going to the Pirate Bay then it's still encrypted doubly going to where it's supposed to go From this tunnel I then connect to Tor.

770
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:50,079
Speaker 1: Right, you know you can do all sorts of stuff.

771
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,200
Speaker 1: Now.

772
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,708
Speaker 1: The thing with this is it's $20 to three months.

773
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:52,733
Speaker 1: It's a bargain.

774
00:56:53,135 --> 00:56:55,165
Speaker 1: It protects you from the fire sheep completely.

775
00:56:55,185 --> 00:56:58,743
Speaker 1: if using open Wi-Fi You can only use it on one device at a time.

776
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:02,164
Speaker 1: So if I'm using it on my laptop I can't use it on my phone simultaneously.

777
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:02,566
Speaker 1: I have to.

778
00:57:03,672 --> 00:57:09,730
Speaker 1: I have to turn it off on my laptop then turn it on on my phone or I can pay for it twice or three Times or I can get it to work on a router.

779
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:11,900
Speaker 1: But then it doesn't protect you under the router.

780
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,849
Speaker 1: it only protects you above the router and such and such.

781
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:18,630
Speaker 1: But what I've you I've been using it for a little while now and they don't charge you based on usage.

782
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,661
Speaker 1: There's no reason not to always use it.

783
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:22,949
Speaker 1: So I always use it also.

784
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:27,103
Speaker 1: Well, there is one reason not to always use it which is bandwidth right.

785
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:29,411
Speaker 1: the bandwidth on it as far as I can tell is Fine.

786
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,133
Speaker 1: I've.

787
00:57:30,574 --> 00:57:34,646
Speaker 1: when I'm using it I experience no slowdown in general internet using whatsoever.

788
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:35,890
Speaker 1: It's I don't even know it's on.

789
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,409
Speaker 0: I have a feeling I would.

790
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:48,590
Speaker 1: Because files yeah, maybe but when I go to play a game online The ping is way higher because there is latency even though there is significant bandwidth.

791
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:54,549
Speaker 1: So if you're playing a real-time game, like if you're playing chess, it doesn't matter, but if you're playing counter-strike You got to turn that shit off.

792
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,136
Speaker 1: Otherwise your games gonna be ruined.

793
00:57:56,177 --> 00:58:01,021
Speaker 1: your pings are all gonna be like a bajillion because your traffic is going far away And then going to the server.

794
00:58:01,364 --> 00:58:06,796
Speaker 1: It's not good news But I highly recommend it for anyone who can afford $22 for three months.

795
00:58:07,439 --> 00:58:08,784
Speaker 1: It can't hurt right?

796
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:09,105
Speaker 1: It's.

797
00:58:09,165 --> 00:58:19,333
Speaker 1: it's only a good thing and Especially it's especially useful if you're using a shared Wi-Fi and Starbucks unless the Pirate Bay is actually a long play by the intelligence Organizations of the world.

798
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:22,141
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's possible it is.

799
00:58:22,181 --> 00:58:34,470
Speaker 0: then they'll find out that you secretly pirated Firefly and love it But won't tell anyone sure This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

800
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:39,250
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music can't leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
