13
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,580
Speaker 1: but there's something else important about tonight's show.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,959
Speaker 1: It's actually the first episode of season five of deep nights.

15
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:12,425
Speaker 0: You're counting the season.

16
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:13,530
Speaker 1: remember we up.

17
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,161

19
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,546
Speaker 0: It's year five your five.

20
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:18,469
Speaker 0: Why is it season 20 then?

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,120
Speaker 1: Four seasons per year now, but it's one overarching season, and then we have different story arcs like cowboy bebop or get sack.

22
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:41,260
Speaker 1: Those don't have story arcs at all yeah, but internally there's the standalone episodes and the complex episodes But they're all part of the same season, but we don't have any complex, but we have Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday.

23
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:43,610
Speaker 0: Which ones of those are complex?

24
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:54,136
Speaker 1: pretty much only the Mondays and The other four shows are basically review media or bitch about stuff and then Monday is like failing in last.

25
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:55,280
Speaker 0: today other four shows.

26
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,220
Speaker 0: What's the picture?

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,623
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

28
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:59,276
Speaker 1: the other four shows from nothing?

29
00:01:59,316 --> 00:01:59,780
Speaker 1: the specials?

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,340
Speaker 1: Okay Yeah, but you know that aside for Halloween we kept saying we're gonna do a state of the podcast on Halloween.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:17,640
Speaker 0: And then now you kept saying I didn't say shit the Royal way, so we Maybe I've been part of your way, maybe to differentiate that.

32
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:19,209
Speaker 1: There's a tasteless joke.

33
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:27,170
Speaker 1: I'll skip there, but maybe instead I should always whenever someone's using the Royal we I feel like you should say whoa like some sort of like way.

34
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:29,213
Speaker 1: Maybe put a roll the R.

35
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,604
Speaker 0: That's silent That's not rolling the art.

36
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:34,790
Speaker 1: if it's a silent R. It's definitely rolled.

37
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:43,007
Speaker 0: Anyway, so here let me do Some Sort of opening bits.

38
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:54,253
Speaker 1: I was about to say instead of you know doing a state of the podcast We just went into the city with a bunch of our friends and watched the Halloween parade Which the theme this year was here be dragons.

39
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:59,276
Speaker 0: Yeah that That part with the with the water in the old-school map that was good stuff.

40
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:00,280
Speaker 1: That was pretty hardcore.

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:09,139
Speaker 1: That was there was that the highlights of the parade were pretty much that which was like the main thing and that one Gigantic crawling skeleton that was far bigger than I thought.

42
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,489
Speaker 0: Yep, let's see what's going on over here.

43
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,934
Speaker 0: I got the TV today.

44
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:15,539
Speaker 0: Okay, okay, okay?

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,643
Speaker 1: No couch now.

46
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:17,688
Speaker 1: Did you order a couch?

47
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,040
Speaker 1: you haven't picked a couch yet, and I picked the couch.

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,754
Speaker 0: I just have an order to get cuz I need some money.

49
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:27,438
Speaker 1: yeah Couches are surprisingly expensive and the weird thing is because this one's actually you know come I look.

50
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:28,120
Speaker 0: I was look at it.

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,820
Speaker 0: I was like it was like $200 delivery from Ikea like.

52
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,265
Speaker 0: But actually it's.

53
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:32,646
Speaker 0: even.

54
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:44,147
Speaker 1: then it turns out like other couches like 1200 before delivery, so I'm like well I'm looking at couches to do my possible house and the more I look it's like the more expensive.

55
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:48,139
Speaker 1: the more like minimalist and simple the couch is the more expensive it is.

56
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:49,464
Speaker 0: Now this.

57
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:50,793
Speaker 0: I'll show you this one that I'm gonna get.

58
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,800
Speaker 0: maybe you can get the same one.

59
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,463
Speaker 0: It's really.

60
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,393
Speaker 0: it's very good for sleeping on to.

61
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,683
Speaker 0: I laid on it at the IKEA And it was like oh

62
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:08,026
Speaker 1: so kind of this vague idea of I want like one kind of small stylish couch with maybe Like a built-in table on it like fancy style and low and then I want a bunch of like low Stylist change lounges upstairs.

63
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:12,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, here's the thing is like I got this TV and the TV is pretty low.

64
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:13,676
Speaker 0: It's not like high up.

65
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:20,480
Speaker 0: So if I sit in my freedom chair I sort of have to look down at it say you should have mounted it higher or mounted it on one of those arms.

66
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:25,150
Speaker 0: It's not mounted on the wall It's sitting on the thing mounted on the wall.

67
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:26,155
Speaker 0: No.

68
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:26,517
Speaker 0: I can't.

69
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:27,080
Speaker 0: I could do that.

70
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,025
Speaker 1: Why not just pay someone?

71
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:28,468
Speaker 1: they'll do it.

72
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:32,170
Speaker 0: the thing is I got until I get a couch Or like a sumo.

73
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:34,851
Speaker 0: it's real uncomfortable TV.

74
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,013
Speaker 1: I'm definitely thinking

75
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:40,300
Speaker 0: I get a rug the couch and like maybe one or two sumos eventually

76
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:49,950
Speaker 1: I'm definitely thinking about when I get the TV wherever I am mounting it If not on the swivel arm at least on the you know angle the TV slightly in any direction arm.

77
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:51,699
Speaker 0: That's the thing is odd.

78
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,270
Speaker 0: What's on the stand and went because it's on the stand.

79
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,769
Speaker 0: I can aim it at the kitchen and I can aim it at the computer Or I can aim it straight ahead at the couch.

80
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,475
Speaker 0: that doesn't exist yet, so it's like.

81
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:04,585
Speaker 0: I can aim it any which way It's very good.

82
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:04,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, well.

83
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:13,985
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about in the kitchen because I don't in that if I get that house Then I don't need the kitchen monitor and the kitchen computer with the kitchen sound system because it's kind of close enough to the living room.

84
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:14,438
Speaker 1: see the TV.

85
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,527
Speaker 0: yeah, I have a bedroom and I have the Core CV sound system.

86
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:20,290
Speaker 1: I've saved up.

87
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,300
Speaker 0: I just need something for the computer here.

88
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,275
Speaker 0: It's very annoying to have no audio on the computer.

89
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:26,119
Speaker 1: sadly I've saved up so much money.

90
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:36,884
Speaker 1: You know just as this house has taken so long to buy because apparently the people owed it before me never Ever paid property taxes and the bank's trying to sort that shit out I've saved up so much money.

91
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:41,718
Speaker 1: I might just buy a bigger house nearby at this point and just forget this the house.

92
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:45,405
Speaker 0: I'm waiting on What you gonna do.

93
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:48,420
Speaker 1: yeah, I got a lot of money in the bank because I expected to have a mortgage payment.

94
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,135
Speaker 1: So I was being frugal, so I've got all this money.

95
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:56,031
Speaker 0: No frugal right now The only things I'm buying are necessities like food right.

96
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,479
Speaker 1: I only spent a thousand dollars last month.

97
00:05:58,579 --> 00:05:58,920
Speaker 1: total.

98
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:01,567
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm buying.

99
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,464
Speaker 0: you know rent obviously paying the bill You know all the.

100
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,800
Speaker 0: you know transportation all the necessities, and then the only other things.

101
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,335
Speaker 0: I'm spending money on our household things, and that's it.

102
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:17,079
Speaker 0: so that's like Until I have all the household things sorted out not buying any luxury of any sort.

103
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,913
Speaker 1: Oh, no beacon got a lot more exciting.

104
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:24,597
Speaker 1: I was not running yesterday and I see you know there's all those like all around beacon.

105
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:26,800
Speaker 1: more and more I'm seeing those weird Verizon trailers.

106
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,600
Speaker 1: They're like a little trailer with the door on it and then a bunch of cables just come out and go up into the poles.

107
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not quite a few of those.

108
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:42,177
Speaker 1: so I finally went up to one and I looked at it and on the side It said Verizon FiOS something and then behind it they put the labels on whatever.

109
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:46,560
Speaker 1: no behind It was a big sign that was like and it was pointing at the street.

110
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:55,820
Speaker 1: I just never noticed it because it faces the street of like another subdivision Right next to where I live now, and it was like FiOS installed here, and it pointed at a house that had FiOS.

111
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:00,640
Speaker 1: So I was like oh shit, so I look online and FiOS is here at this house.

112
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,319
Speaker 1: I could get it if I was gonna stay here.

113
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:06,538
Speaker 1: It's not at the other half of beacon yet, but all the beacons getting FiOS real soon.

114
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there was that house that was like on the edge of fish killed near the highway.

115
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, now it's all the way up.

116
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,218
Speaker 1: You know that subdivision on the road that goes up to the prison right at the edge of beacon they have FiOS.

117
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,520
Speaker 1: now Oh Yeah, like right next to that the rice store.

118
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,808
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of excited and I'm looking.

119
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:24,651
Speaker 1: I'm thinking more and more.

120
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:33,100
Speaker 1: I might get the business class FiOS and we could theoretically Bring the geek guides hosting fully in-house and have a lot more capability to do crazy bullshit.

121
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you know let's leave it at lino.

122
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,285
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think my plan We should always have a line.

123
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,320
Speaker 0: Oh, you should know what we should do with that sort of hosting is video.

124
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:44,877
Speaker 1: We can house video and game servers to start well.

125
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:45,440
Speaker 0: We could do that.

126
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,758
Speaker 0: We could bring we get rid of the libs in you know and you can all.

127
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,311
Speaker 0: yeah He servers you know all that sort of stuff.

128
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,940
Speaker 1: basically what I want to do is one.

129
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,000
Speaker 1: I want to keep the line out cuz it's good to have a secondary site and to have you know distributed hosting especially if we start consolidating.

130
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:07,104
Speaker 0: But I just love the idea of having like so their electricity is a little bit more reliable than say you know your house Yeah, but at the same time.

131
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,211
Speaker 1: I'm planning on getting beefy equipment.

132
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:09,552
Speaker 1: cuz remember.

133
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,740
Speaker 1: I have access to the old like IBM gray market.

134
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:14,778
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy gigantic ups.

135
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:20,120
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy ups big enough to at least keep a server rag going for a couple hours Mmm.

136
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:24,460
Speaker 1: No you know one of the as big as I would need it for a couple of servers on the cat.

137
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,834
Speaker 1: That kind of rack would be like 400 bucks.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:36,905
Speaker 1: Huh even so anyway, that's half a couch almost yeah, but I've to be fair as I whip out my penis I make a lot more money than you.

139
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:38,773
Speaker 1: I have money to just piss away on bullshit.

140
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:47,165
Speaker 0: You know make that much money Almost twice what you make The What's it called.

141
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:50,900
Speaker 0: I had to buy some HDMI cables right and luckily they showed up today.

142
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,915
Speaker 0: But I ordered them from that mono price calm that everyone seems to love.

143
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:55,859

144
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:58,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a two HDMI cables.

145
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:00,500
Speaker 0: guess how much they were individually.

146
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,054
Speaker 1: You wouldn't ask unless it was real high or real low.

147
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:04,999
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say six bucks.

148
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,736
Speaker 0: They were like a dollar ninety two I.

149
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:11,269
Speaker 1: The thing is six bucks.

150
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,843
Speaker 1: I would have thought yeah, that's a great deal You know.

151
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:16,392
Speaker 0: and the thing was I was gonna get him from Amazon basics.

152
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:16,833
Speaker 0: right.

153
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:20,907
Speaker 0: Amazon has this new thing Amazon basics Or be here, which is exactly what it sounds.

154
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,913
Speaker 1: you're almost gonna say basically, and then you didn't.

155
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:24,599
Speaker 0: it's basically like Amazon.

156
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,395
Speaker 0: there goes It's Amazon branded stuff and one of the stuff.

157
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,600
Speaker 0: They have is you know cable.

158
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,289
Speaker 1: I didn't know they were doing that.

159
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,280
Speaker 1: that means by Amazon stock Jesus.

160
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:37,231
Speaker 0: You can get like an Amazon branded USB cable you know.

161
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:45,360
Speaker 0: and thing is they have some HDMI cables here, let's see HDMI cable for about six bucks, but mono price beat Amazon.

162
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:54,763
Speaker 1: You know it's interesting because Amazon beat everyone in the world except for specialty tech stuff like cables or Electronics.

163
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:57,474
Speaker 1: you got to go to like Newegg or one of those specially cable place.

164
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,656
Speaker 0: one more one more thing about this And then we will proceed with our show.

165
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:00,959
Speaker 0: right.

166
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,544
Speaker 0: HDMI cables that I got there.

167
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:11,307
Speaker 0: HDMI version 1.3, so I was like what the hell was version 1.0.

168
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:14,200
Speaker 0: Are we on version 2. yet am I sure about getting the right one?

169
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,886
Speaker 0: I'm like what the hell's the difference right.

170
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:19,440
Speaker 0: so I went to Wikipedia, and you know what it says what it said.

171
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,027
Speaker 0: Well first of all 1.3 is just fine.

172
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:26,101
Speaker 0: That's what you want right now right, but coming very soon is 1.4.

173
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:34,947
Speaker 1: It's like the different DVI's where you could use DVI like one cable have two different monitors on it or like That DVI dual link.

174
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:35,910
Speaker 0: that's completely different

175
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:41,146
Speaker 1: because there's also like some DVI cables can support the old analog stuff like in Parallel and some cans

176
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:53,733
Speaker 0: now the straight-up upgrade you know alright, so here's the thing HDMI 1.3 can do our you know color video right in either RBG mode or YC BCR mode.

177
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,100
Speaker 0: it's basically DVI video.

178
00:10:55,301 --> 00:11:06,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, right it can do DV audio super audio CD Automatic lip-syncing true HD something Dolby something DTS audio stuff, right?

179
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,171
Speaker 0: That's what HDMI 3 1.3 can do.

180
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:16,206
Speaker 0: HDMI 1.4 can also Am number one.

181
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:21,702
Speaker 0: it has an audio return channel so audio can go both ways on it at the same time Alright.

182
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:27,780
Speaker 0: number two it has some sort of 3d over HDMI, which I think is possibly for 3d movies.

183
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:28,988
Speaker 0: I'm not sure exactly.

184
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:29,834
Speaker 0: It's it's something.

185
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:36,180
Speaker 1: yeah Well, I see more and more 3d stuff is I think gonna pick up because that I can't keep that in the realm of the theater.

186
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:39,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure exactly what it is, but it's 3d over HDMI.

187
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:44,520
Speaker 0: Whatever that means it can support a much much larger resolution video.

188
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:48,374
Speaker 0: I like a red camera hooked up with HDMI almost.

189
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:56,857
Speaker 0: It's 4k alright And you know what else you can have on there with all that other stuff on this one cable You're not gonna.

190
00:11:56,877 --> 00:12:04,429
Speaker 0: You know you're not gonna say HDMI 1.4 can also have Ethernet at the same time.

191
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,536
Speaker 1: Ha that's actually what.

192
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:09,385
Speaker 0: with one cable you can have Ethernet in both directions.

193
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:10,770
Speaker 0: audio in both directions.

194
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:17,527
Speaker 0: 3d ultra high definition video in one direction and by the way the audio is basically perfect.

195
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:21,030
Speaker 0: digital audio One cable.

196
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:28,077
Speaker 1: It's a good cable that that's what happens when you move everything to digital And you don't need analog for anything anymore.

197
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:31,068
Speaker 1: you can have longer cable lengths, and you can cram more into the cable.

198
00:12:31,832 --> 00:12:35,387
Speaker 0: Yep, see the reason that this cable can do all this though right it's good.

199
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:35,910
Speaker 0: think about it.

200
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,380
Speaker 0: None of those that you know you can't people like.

201
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,846
Speaker 0: oh welcome USB isn't?

202
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:40,750
Speaker 0: you know that great?

203
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,432
Speaker 0: You know it's like.

204
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,718
Speaker 0: well because this is just a dumb cable.

205
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:47,770
Speaker 0: USB as actually has a serial data transfer protocol that needs thinking.

206
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,176
Speaker 0: You know both ends.

207
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:52,330
Speaker 0: HDMI is just like take the audio shove it down the wire.

208
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,070
Speaker 0: You know there's not a lot of thinking going on in the protocol.

209
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,402
Speaker 0: It just sends it down the wire straight up, and it assumes.

210
00:12:58,462 --> 00:12:59,867
Speaker 0: You know reliability and such.

211
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:02,065
Speaker 0: so All right.

212
00:13:03,112 --> 00:13:04,198
Speaker 0: So new that's going on.

213
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,224
Speaker 1: I got a bunch of news.

214
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,129
Speaker 1: Do you have any news?

215
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,649
Speaker 0: Do I have a news?

216
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:13,822
Speaker 0: Well there's so much tech news going on.

217
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:15,270
Speaker 0: I don't know which one I'm gonna talk about.

218
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,110
Speaker 0: I don't feel like I have a lot to say about some of the really good ones.

219
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,270
Speaker 1: You know I want to talk a little bit about even though it's more society than it is really technology.

220
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:33,489
Speaker 1: But there's that whole story about the blogger that supposedly humiliated an entire set of town counselors into resigning by basically calling them out on whatever.

221
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:35,613
Speaker 0: Actually, it is enough.

222
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:44,950
Speaker 1: people read his blog that cared and mattered from what I can gather and obviously not all the details are readily Available and I did not engage in any significant amount of journalism.

223
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:49,390
Speaker 1: I basically read slashdot comments, and then I followed like one link some slashdot guy linked.

224
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:51,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the opposite of journalism.

225
00:13:52,692 --> 00:14:02,347
Speaker 1: I would argue that that's more journalism than was put into the majority of newspaper articles I attempted to read in print in the last month Maybe I bought a New York Times not that long ago.

226
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,315
Speaker 1: I was curious.

227
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,330
Speaker 1: I was curious how low the rabbit hole went kind of like how I went back to dig the other day.

228
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:09,758
Speaker 0: It's just old news.

229
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,281
Speaker 1: No.

230
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:11,006
Speaker 1: It's not even just that.

231
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:11,690
Speaker 1: it was old news.

232
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,837
Speaker 1: It was poorly written old news.

233
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:17,530
Speaker 1: like I could write a better article just by looking on the internet.

234
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,111
Speaker 1: I'll tell it anyone understand it that I'm not even talking poorly written like written at the seventh grade level like most newspapers are.

235
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:27,227
Speaker 1: I'm talking about just poorly written even for a seventh grader.

236
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:40,629
Speaker 1: I can write good But there's a lot going on here and as far as I can tell the guy basically was blogging about what was going on and pointing out what the counselors were doing.

237
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:47,670
Speaker 1: and Enough people Found out about this in his blog to where it wasn't that they read his blog and then got angry.

238
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,889
Speaker 1: It was that they read his blog and then started showing up at the council meetings to see what was going on.

239
00:14:53,474 --> 00:15:03,990
Speaker 1: And as far as I can tell these counselors It's a volunteer position anyway And all that just could not in any way handle public scrutiny and people asking them questions and challenging them in person.

240
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:05,827
Speaker 1: So they all quit because they couldn't take the heat.

241
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,641
Speaker 1: And I You know, I didn't read all the details.

242
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:18,225
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a lot more going on here But this is not a story of oh my god blogs are now the future of journalism blah blah blah.

243
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:19,788
Speaker 1: The real story here.

244
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:36,943
Speaker 1: Is that Technology is getting to the point to where it is very trivial for one person doing any amount of investigative journalism In a non national realm like anything local anything small To bring enough physical local pressure on to people to make stuff happen.

245
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:46,040
Speaker 1: I mean most local politicians get no Examination whatsoever except like the old biddies who show up to the town council meetings at four o'clock on a Thursday while the rest of us work.

246
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:55,290
Speaker 1: but if you get if a blogger in the local town gets just enough people interested enough to force them to Do something or come under any scrutiny?

247
00:15:56,311 --> 00:16:05,084
Speaker 1: I don't think a lot of people can deal with scrutiny and especially as far as I can tell the people who resigned were Basically the really conservative people from the conservative part of town who got elected.

248
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:12,084
Speaker 1: but a lot of other people in the area are more liberal And I've seen this trend where generally at all levels of government.

249
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:21,810
Speaker 1: people who are reactionary or conservative Really can't actually defend their opinions or their positions against any amount of public questioning or scrutiny.

250
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,178
Speaker 0: I think that's just any.

251
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:31,918
Speaker 0: most people period yeah Any opinion they have regardless if it's a political Recently questioning whatsoever.

252
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:31,958
Speaker 0: I

253
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:46,347
Speaker 1: saw a video recently about it was I think was a state government thing and there was another one at the national level where there was a debate about whether or not to legalize marijuana and All the people who were pro legalization had actual arguments and when confronted with counter arguments responded.

254
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:48,576
Speaker 1: and all that Without question.

255
00:16:48,656 --> 00:17:01,291
Speaker 1: everyone against the legalization of marijuana Had talking points and the moment anyone questioned those talking points or provided an argument that they didn't have a talking point for they had no answer at all and More and more.

256
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:07,030
Speaker 1: I think it's just you know the old argument that people say the media is biased toward liberals or that sort of thing.

257
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:25,929
Speaker 1: I think it's just that the meat more and more the facts are biased toward the right answers and it's harder and harder to hide from the fact that your position is indefensible when Very few people can use technology that more and more of the people defending indefensible positions don't understand to bring to light their indefensibility.

258
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:28,843
Speaker 0: Could be?

259
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:30,253
Speaker 0: I mean You know is it?

260
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:36,471
Speaker 0: is it that there are certain positions that are only held because their holdovers from a time when we didn't know Better?

261
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:43,169
Speaker 1: and by and large that's the kinds of positions that I see on the wrong side of the people who are also technologically proficient.

262
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:46,474
Speaker 1: Yeah But also look at this.

263
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:50,164
Speaker 1: remember sanctuary right, what were they trying to do in sanctuary?

264
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:51,869
Speaker 0: the goal wasn't really a cousin.

265
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,158
Speaker 1: That aside let that finger fly.

266
00:17:55,178 --> 00:17:57,145
Speaker 0: Did you watch the latest South Park with the whales?

267
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:57,787
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

268
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:01,940
Speaker 0: Fuck you It was genius, but did you notice?

269
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,845
Speaker 0: there's a big boat full of Japanese people.

270
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,390
Speaker 1: yes, and I thought about sanctuary.

271
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:11,739
Speaker 1: I also thought about sanctuary, but the thing is that was an episode where the whole time I'm like where are they going with this?

272
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,226
Speaker 0: I knew where they were going with it.

273
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:14,070
Speaker 0: that chicken and cow.

274
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:23,037
Speaker 1: I saw a chicken and cow coming, but I did not expect the method like the the method of the Enola game Thing right before it.

275
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:24,303
Speaker 0: I did not know I did not.

276
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:33,277
Speaker 1: when they zoomed in on that picture Suddenly it all clicked But I'm glad that they waited until the last line of the episode and they're like now.

277
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:38,517
Speaker 1: you made them normal, and it's like oh Yeah, I knew that was coming.

278
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:41,150
Speaker 0: yeah still genius yeah.

279
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:48,163
Speaker 1: But Anyway in sanctuary remember their goal was not take over the government.

280
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:54,762
Speaker 1: the goal was get people Interested in government again because the people take direct involvement.

281
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:57,772
Speaker 0: the whole system falls down the old people out And young people.

282
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:04,458
Speaker 1: all you have to do is bring the baleful gaze of the youth on to government and active And it all.

283
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,009
Speaker 1: it all just works itself out in the end.

284
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,190
Speaker 1: And that's kind of what this guy did here.

285
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,436
Speaker 1: I mean who reads blogs who blogs?

286
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,705
Speaker 1: I mean how many towns are gonna imagine this?

287
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:20,966
Speaker 1: I imagine the scene ten years from now town council meeting and all the councilors are like old men and old women.

288
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:29,109
Speaker 1: and then Suddenly like at one town council meeting 20 punk kids show up and start asking questions and using words that the old people just don't understand.

289
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:31,535
Speaker 1: And then all they don't want.

290
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:34,045
Speaker 0: the one thing about this those right people always talk about.

291
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,190
Speaker 0: you know they want open government.

292
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,973
Speaker 0: They want to know they want to see what's going on right, and it's like well first of all We had c-spans.

293
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:42,624
Speaker 0: the government is actually pretty open when you think about it.

294
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:48,862
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is I born That's true, but if you look at like you know things that have happened.

295
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,450
Speaker 0: like you know I remember there was an article about this.

296
00:19:51,791 --> 00:20:02,441
Speaker 0: It was a Cory Doctorow thing where he talked about how there were like these protests in in the UK and basically there were videos Just police beating up protesters, and it was totally wrong.

297
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,567
Speaker 0: and everyone thought the videos are everywhere.

298
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:05,530
Speaker 0: It was not a secret.

299
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:12,085
Speaker 0: it was totally transparent right and Nothing happened, and he's like transparency doesn't matter without justice.

300
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:12,747
Speaker 0: Yep.

301
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:17,690
Speaker 0: It's like You're mad going on if you can't do anything about it.

302
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,372
Speaker 0: It's you know.

303
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,335
Speaker 0: it's like think about it.

304
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:27,650
Speaker 0: if those people went and questioned those town council people and the town council people were dicks And just ignored them then none of it would have mattered.

305
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:29,819
Speaker 1: But at the same time the sense of social justice.

306
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,645
Speaker 1: so 20 punk kids show up right and they Basically show up and they get blown off.

307
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:38,421
Speaker 1: either They don't get mad and they give up or they get mad.

308
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,087
Speaker 1: they get mad.

309
00:20:40,147 --> 00:21:00,789
Speaker 1: and if they get mad Like the guy in the movie that we talk about all the time now if they get mad in the non rioting way and they just keep coming back to the council meetings and they force debate if it's one of those councils where they can if they Force fucking Roberts rules of order every time and be as legally pain in the ass as they possibly can.

310
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:11,066
Speaker 1: I Don't think the old people ruining things can keep up with that and then fight it for too long without getting tired and Independently of that say they don't win even doing that.

311
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:23,850
Speaker 1: the next step They go out and they start getting everyone else riled up because think about it you and me Could put to bear enough resources to pause to probably like change everything in local government in like beacon.

312
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:30,589
Speaker 1: I mean we could print more flyers than anyone printed in all the campaigns combined for the election.

313
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:37,164
Speaker 1: now We can make websites and blogs and we could just we could do crazy media that the people currently running for office Don't even know how to do.

314
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:40,342
Speaker 0: The thing is they can walk around town to every house.

315
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:41,950
Speaker 0: We can't really do that.

316
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:47,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think you need to do that anymore because if you just get enough people angry I mean How did Michael Moore get elected?

317
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:52,655
Speaker 1: you get all the 18 year olds to vote for him and 18 year olds voted in more numbers Than everyone else combined.

318
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:56,350
Speaker 0: That's when he was 18 and in high school and he knew all the 18 year olds in his small.

319
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:06,870
Speaker 1: So if you and I if we go to a high school and we're all hip and cool and we don't Arrest us as soon as you walk onto the grass now Because what you got to do is fake it all and be like lecture series.

320
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:09,010
Speaker 1: I want to do an assembly and we're business professionals.

321
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:10,727
Speaker 1: We can easily get an assembly at a high school.

322
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,800
Speaker 0: The school has you to do an assembly you don't ask them to do.

323
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,089
Speaker 1: now a lot of assembly people approach high schools.

324
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:17,197
Speaker 1: be like I have this assembly.

325
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:17,904
Speaker 1: Will you let me do it?

326
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,375
Speaker 0: Maybe we should get in the assembly business.

327
00:22:20,495 --> 00:22:21,138
Speaker 1: I want to.

328
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,062
Speaker 1: I really want to.

329
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:23,950
Speaker 1: I just haven't spent much effort on it.

330
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,816
Speaker 0: You're gonna make the greatest assembly.

331
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:26,678
Speaker 0: like kids.

332
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:29,948
Speaker 0: your grades don't mean shit, but if you got bad grades, you're a moron.

333
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:33,536
Speaker 1: and also You pull the bait and smash.

334
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:37,976
Speaker 1: your assembly is like you start doing something normal and then you're like Wargle-bargle.

335
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:39,465
Speaker 1: come to the assembly meetings vote for me.

336
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:46,657
Speaker 1: We'll change everything I'll make your I'll drink big age 18. just lie to them and then they'll all show up Steve.

337
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:50,198
Speaker 1: oh But I don't know.

338
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,309
Speaker 1: I think I think that.

339
00:22:52,193 --> 00:22:56,350
Speaker 1: Well, look at our, you know Scott Johnson our friend of FRC member the good Scott Johnson.

340
00:22:56,711 --> 00:23:03,550
Speaker 1: He is running for local government and he's like the youngest dude to run like ever out there.

341
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:09,250
Speaker 0: I think we just need to change the rules that say you have to be like what like 40 something to be run for president.

342
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,547
Speaker 0: I mean that's complete bullshit at this point.

343
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:17,590
Speaker 0: Yeah Because it's in the Constitution, I know we need an amendment big time.

344
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,560
Speaker 0: We should also need to really amend even more.

345
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:21,410
Speaker 0: so the one with the age limits on Congress.

346
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,193
Speaker 0: You're 18.

347
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,597
Speaker 0: You should be able to run for anything.

348
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:32,730
Speaker 0: period you know, and if people you know, if people actually believe You know what if you're 18, you know the smoker drink is not qualified then don't vote for this not even further.

349
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,365
Speaker 1: I think the age of whatever we pick the age of majority to be should be.

350
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:37,027
Speaker 1: it should be 100% rights.

351
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:42,355
Speaker 1: But I mean no qualification at all if you're 18 and that's the age of majority Drinking smoke and everything.

352
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:43,278
Speaker 0: Yep.

353
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,180
Speaker 0: Exactly.

354
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,003
Speaker 0: It's hypocritical.

355
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:45,484
Speaker 0: That's it.

356
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,270
Speaker 0: You know to give one and not the other.

357
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:51,550
Speaker 1: But then I won't be able to buy any more ultra porn.

358
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,759
Speaker 0: No, I can't rent ultra porn anymore.

359
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:00,432
Speaker 0: All right, I'll do this one thing of the day real quick Just one side thing of the day Thing of the day.

360
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,375
Speaker 0: news real quick.

361
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:06,870
Speaker 0: All right, so apparently there's actually some movement in the department of web fonts.

362
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:16,963
Speaker 0: I don't know if people understand the situation here, right, but basically In your web browser their web pages really only use like a handful of fonts.

363
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:24,442
Speaker 0: and the reason they use that handful of fonts is Because those are the only fonts that are like guaranteed to be on every computer.

364
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:31,901
Speaker 0: because Microsoft I think of the Microsoft like core fonts like Microsoft perp You know put them out there and said these are the fonts everyone can have for free.

365
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:38,027
Speaker 0: and if you think about like copyright and music Copyright on fonts is like the worst in the universe.

366
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,695
Speaker 0: like This is the real it's.

367
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:45,170
Speaker 0: it's so horrible like just all the fonts that are like standard font.

368
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:51,850
Speaker 0: You just can't get it's like, you know, a lot of people like don't even appreciate like, you know.

369
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:55,250
Speaker 0: They install Photoshop and they get like a bajillion bajillion fonts.

370
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,561
Speaker 0: That's probably the reason Photoshop is so expensive even worse.

371
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,467
Speaker 1: There's so many free fonts and by and large.

372
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:03,994
Speaker 0: They're awful Terrible, right?

373
00:25:04,075 --> 00:25:07,250
Speaker 1: I mean they look nice if you don't know better, but then we try to use them typographically.

374
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:18,029
Speaker 1: They're just like they're unbearable like your website looks bad and you don't understand why because it's like some subtle Typographical thing because the font was poorly designed like the kerning is off or something like that.

375
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:23,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, typography is actually really complicated and people just you know, if you need anyway the.

376
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:28,833
Speaker 0: so The thing is like let's say I want to use a font on my website But I don't.

377
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,306
Speaker 0: I can't guarantee that rim has this font on his computer.

378
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:35,122
Speaker 0: if he comes to my website He's not gonna see the font that I picked.

379
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:39,630
Speaker 0: he's gonna see like Ariel All right, and that sucks because now I can't make my website all fancy.

380
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:46,983
Speaker 0: Now what I could do is I could type that fancy font in Photoshop save an image and use that But now Google doesn't see that.

381
00:25:47,063 --> 00:25:48,070
Speaker 0: Google just see image.

382
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,490
Speaker 0: It doesn't know that the image has text in it in my fancy font to make my site look good, right?

383
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:59,790
Speaker 0: So the ability to use any font on any website and just you know When if rim visited the site and he didn't have the font he would download it somehow.

384
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:03,450
Speaker 0: That is like a like a holy grail of websites.

385
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:07,100
Speaker 0: So much because you could make your site look.

386
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:10,410
Speaker 0: however, you want it typographically with any font that you had.

387
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,798
Speaker 1: Think about the fucked up in this of this situation.

388
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,950
Speaker 1: Wow, fuck up in this is now my favorite word.

389
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:18,283
Speaker 0: Really fucked up in this.

390
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,476
Speaker 0: Anyway.

391
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:29,350
Speaker 1: So imagine this I log out of some NS server or counter-strike server and it has an entire map that I don't have.

392
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:36,790
Speaker 1: It automatically downloads the entire map and then I can play immediately with the same map as everyone else.

393
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:40,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, I go to a website and that doesn't happen with a font Exactly.

394
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:54,229
Speaker 0: And the reason is because the people who make fonts like these complete copyright douchebags like you can go online and look like individual fonts and There'll be people like charging like hundreds of dollars for a font like just one font to have it.

395
00:26:54,852 --> 00:27:02,070
Speaker 0: You know and like there's a website it's actually a really good website called blam bot Right, and it makes these webs.

396
00:27:02,271 --> 00:27:13,014
Speaker 0: It makes it's his guy and primarily he makes fonts that are used for like comic book lettering and he actually has these really good Fonts for comic book lettering and he's like a really good Typography guy.

397
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:24,683
Speaker 0: the thing is, you know, he's got free fonts, but he's also got pay fonts that he's also got Limited edition fonts, you know and the pay fonts are not cheap.

398
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:27,510
Speaker 0: Let's see 20 bucks for one font.

399
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:32,890
Speaker 0: So, you know, I mean it's good and if I was doing comic book lettering.

400
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:45,364
Speaker 0: I would probably pay him to help me out because he you know, he's got really good fonts, but 20 bucks for a font Jesus, you know, and so there's no way these people will let you you know Download a font just because you visit a website of someone who has the font.

401
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:50,290
Speaker 0: then you'll be doing huge You know, where will they get any money if everyone has all these fonts on their computer?

402
00:27:51,130 --> 00:28:00,010
Speaker 0: So Mozilla and other people are finally making progress on Making, you know some fonts that I'll be able to download onto other people's computers.

403
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,763
Speaker 0: So there's going to be support for it in the next Firefox.

404
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,630
Speaker 0: And so we'll see how this goes.

405
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,632
Speaker 0: Hopefully it will work out and not suck.

406
00:28:15,217 --> 00:28:16,778
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

407
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:18,980
Speaker 1: This is my favorite kind of prank.

408
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,859
Speaker 1: It's the nice knife for a good knife for flying prank.

409
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:30,838
Speaker 0: Well, it's the kind of inexplicable except the thing is this only the first only the first person who reacts to it reacts in that kind of way.

410
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:46,640
Speaker 1: Little girl who just looks under there, you know there's a lot of study about how little kids are generally much less easily fooled by Randy bullshit and everything because When confronted with something unbelievable, they ask direct questions and look for direct evidence.

411
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:48,940
Speaker 1: But adults will go to a chiropractor.

412
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:50,119
Speaker 0: That's right.

413
00:28:50,662 --> 00:29:01,040
Speaker 1: but anyway that the problem with this prank is that the the video is pretty good because it shows you like how to do the Prank and the good idea, but they don't fully execute the prank the way it needs to be executed.

414
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:10,228
Speaker 1: The best rank is you make a model that looks exactly like a real kid dressed up as something trick-or-treating And you leave it on someone's doorstep.

415
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:19,517
Speaker 0: So, you know, they you know trick-or-treat they open the door There's a kid that you have to knock on the door and then you have to hide with a camera that zoomed in so you Can see what's going on or you just leave it there and wait.

416
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:22,363
Speaker 1: So what?

417
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:24,672
Speaker 1: but you leave it there right and then you knock on door.

418
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:28,128
Speaker 1: a person comes out and they react like oh cute Kid the kid doesn't say anything.

419
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,013
Speaker 1: they go kind of whatever.

420
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:32,385
Speaker 1: they put the candy in the basket The kid still doesn't move.

421
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:34,230
Speaker 1: close the door kids still doesn't move.

422
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,415
Speaker 1: perfectly stationary uncanny valley on the door.

423
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:41,160
Speaker 1: again person gets creeped out But the video doesn't really go all the way.

424
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:45,699
Speaker 1: The real way to do this prank is to get like four or five kids in on it.

425
00:29:46,304 --> 00:29:48,500
Speaker 1: So the kids are all at the door, right?

426
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,376
Speaker 1: So you have like two kids at the door and the fake kid knocking the door trick-or-treat.

427
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:55,486
Speaker 1: They all take their stuff They all walk away the one kids still there.

428
00:29:56,028 --> 00:30:00,479
Speaker 1: the other group of kids comes up does the same thing the one kids still there.

429
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,430
Speaker 1: Then you knock a third time and just that kids still there.

430
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:13,080
Speaker 1: and then you just you leave it there and wait for the see What the person does and if they go back into the house or wait you just leave that fucking kid there.

431
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:25,101
Speaker 1: Or you take the kid away and you put them at the street looking at the house all Style.

432
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:26,728
Speaker 1: you put them in the bushes looking at.

433
00:30:26,748 --> 00:30:31,312
Speaker 0: the problem is that the people if they look out their window They'll see you moving the kid around.

434
00:30:31,353 --> 00:30:32,340
Speaker 0: that's the difficult part.

435
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,003
Speaker 1: No, cuz it's dark and you have to you know You time it.

436
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:35,666
Speaker 1: you look through the.

437
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:36,590
Speaker 1: do you see where they look?

438
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,719
Speaker 1: you'd have to be careful and clever, but you could do it.

439
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:42,880
Speaker 0: And also if you fail I imagine if they were at the point of being freaked out.

440
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,280
Speaker 1: They would just be in their window looking at the kid though And and as soon as you've gone to that point you have won and you just never touch the kid again.

441
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:55,016
Speaker 0: Just leave it there and the police would come and take your thing away.

442
00:30:55,076 --> 00:30:55,558
Speaker 1: That's fine.

443
00:30:55,598 --> 00:31:02,248
Speaker 1: That's so worth it All right I mean you could go so much further.

444
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:04,636
Speaker 1: you put it leave it in their backyard just abandon it.

445
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:05,760
Speaker 1: so they forget about.

446
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,227
Speaker 1: you Know man that creepy kid.

447
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:10,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then he left and then the next day they walk out the back door.

448
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,032
Speaker 1: He's just standing there.

449
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:16,700
Speaker 0: I was watching this TED talk and the TED talk was about sabbaticals and how great they are

450
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:27,359
Speaker 1: Dude, so you leave it there right and then after like a few times you get another kid in on it And you leave him you have him scream and then he lays there like bloody in front of the kid.

451
00:31:30,176 --> 00:31:37,450
Speaker 0: Okay So I watch this TED talk about sabbaticals and how great they are and basically this dude He just he's like hey, I know what I'll do.

452
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:45,657
Speaker 0: I'll take five years off of my retirement and every seven years I'll go on a sabbatical you know, so he's doing that and It was totally awesome for him.

453
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,264
Speaker 0: and I'm thinking yeah, you know what?

454
00:31:47,465 --> 00:31:48,450
Speaker 0: Maybe I could do that too.

455
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:51,019
Speaker 0: I'm you know working for seven years like 2012 2013.

456
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:51,662
Speaker 0: I'll go on it's not bad.

457
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:01,928
Speaker 1: I can you know if I quit my job right now or go on sabbatical and I don't buy that house I have enough money to live for like a year.

458
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:05,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, I'm thinking I'd like 2013.

459
00:32:05,264 --> 00:32:06,289
Speaker 0: I'll do it maybe so.

460
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:18,370
Speaker 0: Anyway the at the end of the video he played like this clip of something and Basically, I researched this thing and I found that on YouTube and what this is is it's a little bit Randy.

461
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:24,970
Speaker 0: It's it's laughing yoga, you know, and basically the idea is, you know You laugh a lot and then all your stress goes away.

462
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,806
Speaker 0: but also, you know, there's some Randy about like, you know kidneys or whatever.

463
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:34,930
Speaker 0: right, but The point is is that if you actually watch this laughing yoga guy do his laughing yoga stick.

464
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:39,922
Speaker 0: It is like anime hell solid gold material.

465
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:44,049
Speaker 0: this dude is fucked the fuck up and he is like.

466
00:32:45,612 --> 00:33:05,231
Speaker 0: You can't tell if like he's laughing naturally or if he's just sort of like, you know doing the physical motion you know the the Yes, but also just watching him makes you like laughs like he's Laughing.

467
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:07,842
Speaker 1: the the the the the the the the the the the.

468
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:09,470
Speaker 0: that's exactly the way he makes you laugh.

469
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:11,159
Speaker 0: Exactly that way.

470
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:12,969
Speaker 1: You even almost laughed a little bit at that.

471
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:21,258
Speaker 0: That's that's the way he makes you laugh and it's like, you know, he's been doing this for however many, you know His whole life I guess, you know, he's a yoga dude.

472
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:24,490
Speaker 0: So he's probably studying laughing yoga for decades or whatever.

473
00:33:24,571 --> 00:33:26,040
Speaker 0: So that's what he is mastered.

474
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:35,042
Speaker 0: that so to watch it Watch this is like a minute clip of this dude doing his stick and you know You could do the whole bunch of other videos of him on YouTube doing this stick.

475
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:40,843
Speaker 0: It's It's something to see before you before you.

476
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:42,088
Speaker 0: are you still in this war hope?

477
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:50,317
Speaker 1: So, all right, I guess it's time for the Metamucil, oh That's right.

478
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:50,620
Speaker 0: Okay.

479
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,030
Speaker 0: So here I remembered We did the meta bit the meta moment, right?

480
00:33:55,751 --> 00:34:05,600
Speaker 0: And I forgot that the original one of the original reasons I wanted to do the meta moment was So that we could constantly remind people of the book club.

481
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:08,309
Speaker 0: and yet that is the one thing we have forgotten to do.

482
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:14,074
Speaker 1: Yes, it's all all one of you who read Steppenwolf Right.

483
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,370
Speaker 0: I think I think maybe five people read it anyway.

484
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,550
Speaker 1: Alright guys, seriously, if you didn't read Stephen wolf it ends with a game called murder car.

485
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:23,922
Speaker 1: It's not actually called that but that is what it is and you will see what I mean.

486
00:34:24,284 --> 00:34:26,590
Speaker 0: And that's that's not a lie That's absolutely true.

487
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:37,946
Speaker 0: So the next book club book is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Douglas.

488
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:47,928
Speaker 0: Douglas I have already almost finished reading the first book I bought like the you know, the five-in-one and I'm pretty much gonna be done with this like in a day.

489
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:51,219
Speaker 0: So If you don't read it you suck.

490
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:58,050
Speaker 0: I don't think I have a copy of it anymore But I bought the five copy the five volume thing on it.

491
00:34:58,592 --> 00:34:59,216
Speaker 1: I gotta buy it again.

492
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:01,829
Speaker 1: you guys cuz I was packing up, you know, I'm moving right?

493
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,822
Speaker 1: I packed up almost all my books into boxes.

494
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:06,390
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's in one of those boxes.

495
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:12,904
Speaker 1: fuck Yeah, I love to dig through forever.

496
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,690
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy it again.

497
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:20,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that'd be book club book the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy only the first book.

498
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:26,714
Speaker 0: You can read more if you want and probably will but we're only gonna do that that first one and It's short.

499
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:27,417
Speaker 0: It's easy.

500
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:30,149
Speaker 0: I hope I'm pretty sure it's a book that people actually read.

501
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:34,523
Speaker 0: I've already thought of another one that people actually read for the next time.

502
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,509
Speaker 0: So anyway, that's that.

503
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:40,422
Speaker 0: Any other meta bits we got going on here?

504
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:42,050
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a convention this weekend.

505
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:47,279
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, Zenkai con which I still have to write material for the match game Are we do?

506
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,009
Speaker 0: I didn't know we were doing them.

507
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,598
Speaker 1: Yes, we're doing the match game with good game fact.

508
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:52,110
Speaker 1: two of the guests are people who have been on the match game with us.

509
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:56,270
Speaker 1: Oh those Yeah, and they all know their anime shit.

510
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,549
Speaker 1: So this is gonna be a more - this is gonna be possibly one of the better match games we've ever run.

511
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:07,612
Speaker 1: All right Let's go for I'm excited now because it always sucks to run the match game with people who like don't know anything about The like.

512
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:10,161
Speaker 0: the topic of the convention, you know, I should get the magic.

513
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,589
Speaker 0: we should get the match game music and then we should also.

514
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,466
Speaker 0: Why don't we just get a bunch of original match game questions?

515
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:17,130
Speaker 1: I did that.

516
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,716
Speaker 1: That's how I wrote that.

517
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:21,010
Speaker 1: remember when I rewrote all the questions to be more generic.

518
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:25,106
Speaker 1: I just took original match game questions and change them to sound to have anime proper nouns.

519
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:29,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's Let's just you know, let's do some more of that.

520
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:31,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's get like 20 more.

00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,963
Speaker 0: Good, then I'll have actually time to get back to my house.

538
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:14,152
Speaker 1: I forget if it's two days or not, but whatever I figure we got to plan out all that travel I can.

539
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:20,290
Speaker 1: either I can take the car down to pick you up in the city and then go straight across or you can take The train up here and then drive all of us.

540
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:20,531
Speaker 1: The

541
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,250
Speaker 0: problem is it's hard to park at my house at my apartment on well

542
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:37,716
Speaker 1: No You see because we're going to Jersey one way to do it would be if you took the train to like Tarrytown or something And then I pick you up in Tarrytown and then you start driving from there because then we go right across the Tappan Zee and Then down through Pennsylvania,

543
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:41,210
Speaker 0: you're better off parking in Jersey near like a path train cheaper.

544
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is dry.

545
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,649
Speaker 1: I've got to drive all the way down through Jersey park the car there and then go to work.

546
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:50,630
Speaker 0: You could park at my apartment here if there was a spot on Friday with that.

547
00:37:51,911 --> 00:37:56,427
Speaker 1: Granted I am the master of parking in in the city ever since working in the Bronx.

548
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:01,390
Speaker 0: I can park No, but I have one of the sides of the street gets swept on a Friday.

549
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,890
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm used to that double triple parking parking on the sidewalk.

550
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,717
Speaker 0: We can't leave it there all day like that.

551
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:14,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've done that before with my car to no ill effect though I once just parked on the sidewalk.

552
00:38:14,203 --> 00:38:14,967
Speaker 1: No one died.

553
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:19,330
Speaker 0: No trouble Alright, anyway, let's what's the show gonna be about today?

554
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:23,465
Speaker 1: Well, actually I had a conversation with remember Ken juror from the forums.

555
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:24,750
Speaker 1: He's an old friend of mine from high school.

556
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:39,033
Speaker 1: I think he quit the forum a couple times and finally quit it for good because we always talk about how shitty Yeah, but I randomly started talking to him again after you know finding him on LinkedIn and while I was whole I think I was Home sick.

557
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:41,970
Speaker 1: I forget exactly why I was home, but I was laying in bed tired.

558
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:50,900
Speaker 1: Maybe I was doing the night shift and we started talking on instant messenger and he found something really Really interesting on the internet.

559
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:52,870
Speaker 1: and I'm gonna paraphrase all of this.

560
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:58,918
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna like link to all these different pages, but basically He had geocities and angel fire websites much.

561
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:01,506
Speaker 1: Like I had geocities and angel fire websites man.

562
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:02,609
Speaker 0: Mine don't exist anymore.

563
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:12,203
Speaker 1: We linked to each other right because we were friends like all our friends like we linked to each other's websites and signed each other's guestbooks and all that stuff.

564
00:39:12,223 --> 00:39:18,568
Speaker 1: and He was grabbing all the archives and you know say archiving and saving all this juice.

565
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:18,949
Speaker 1: They didn't know.

566
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:23,356
Speaker 1: these Granny weird parts of it are still online.

567
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:25,000
Speaker 0: I don't understand.

568
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,023
Speaker 0: Ah, it's all.

569
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:27,647
Speaker 1: it's ruins of the internet, which we'll get to.

570
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:31,056
Speaker 1: so whoa Whoa, you made a weird noise.

571
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:34,050
Speaker 0: No, you cut out that came over Skype.

572
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:35,692
Speaker 0: Okay.

573
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:48,264
Speaker 1: In fact, I can prove it came over Skype because I'm multi tracking here You know, let's let's roll back a little bit now, let's just leave it in fast and loose fast karate for the geek nights great.

574
00:39:50,130 --> 00:40:00,150
Speaker 1: so he points out that his old angel fire website, you know, he had his domain and At some point someone else owned this domain because it was like his screen name.

575
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,802
Speaker 1: But then he got it and then he let it go.

576
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:02,548
Speaker 1: and all this business.

577
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:15,290
Speaker 1: So at his old he had found this angel fire website Which had in its URL his screen name, which is also that other guy who once owned the same domain screen name.

578
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:24,410
Speaker 1: Alright on that website is a pre blog blog as in a table that the guy updated the top with with like these blog posts.

579
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:30,969
Speaker 1: and this guy who is not Ken is Kind of racist as far as I can tell.

580
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:36,382
Speaker 1: But It's obviously not Ken, but here's the weirdest fucking part.

581
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,530
Speaker 1: He has a link on this page.

582
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:45,497
Speaker 1: I think he stole the structure of this page from a website that can had once put up or something Because he has a link to quote.

583
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,150
Speaker 1: I got the inspiration to do this from my friend Brad.

584
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:53,321
Speaker 1: All right, and there's a link on the word Brad.

585
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:59,489
Speaker 1: if you click on the word Brad The link is to angel fire comm slash NC slash rim.

586
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:00,825
Speaker 0: Yeah.

587
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:04,719
Speaker 1: So I click on this as Kevin did.

588
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:06,002
Speaker 0: no HTML

589
00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:28,629
Speaker 1: and what it links to is not My website not Brad's website but an angel fire site that has the word rim in it and It just has this angel fire ad and there's a quote that says and in the end when all is said and Kings rain the day Fools shall sing and dead shall bring while angels lose their way rim rest in peace.

590
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:36,132
Speaker 1: And then there are three links talk to the dead remember the past and Email me.

591
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:42,489
Speaker 1: so email me goes to some I don't even like I want to email this to something on this weird domain.

592
00:41:43,493 --> 00:42:04,156
Speaker 1: talk to the dead is to sign a guest book and remember the past is a Guest book as in an internet guest book that looks like finally stopped getting updated around 2006 Was basically was basically nothing but spam from like 2001 until 2004 like that makes it.

593
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:12,090
Speaker 1: I've read through the thing like percentage of spam increases as time goes on And if you go all the way back to like it's weird.

594
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:14,856
Speaker 1: Reading through this and for a while.

595
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:23,189
Speaker 1: I was trying to figure out if maybe this was like us like a stolen Guest book from like one of my old website.

596
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:33,603
Speaker 0: It seems like someone like just like copied and pasted some HTMLs and then edited some bits in them but unless all the rest of it intact and didn't know what was going on.

597
00:42:33,704 --> 00:42:33,824
Speaker 0: or.

598
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:34,085
Speaker 0: but

599
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:35,189
Speaker 1: at the same time I never

600
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:41,913
Speaker 0: had a people hacked into like angel fire geocities and just took over whatever site they wanted to and so

601
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:53,369
Speaker 1: I started poking around more of angel fire and I found all these weird Websites that look like it's like, you know A bunch of hobos break into an abandoned factory and start squatting in it.

602
00:42:53,931 --> 00:43:02,407
Speaker 1: It's almost like internet hobos at the end of the 90s era of the internet like in the early 2000s Broke into old websites and squatted in them.

603
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:05,660
Speaker 0: You know, they do that today.

604
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:08,310
Speaker 0: the thing is, you know people usually notice them event.

605
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:10,679
Speaker 0: It's called vandalism because it's you know,

606
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:30,781
Speaker 1: but I found all this weird Weird shit all over the internet and the fact that some of this stuff like It's the fact that I found this link on this guy's website with a different name But still links to a website that has my name in it and then like again, I don't know I just don't get it cuz it's not like rim.

607
00:43:30,962 --> 00:43:40,210
Speaker 1: RYM is a common name on the internet Especially the english-speaking internet let alone from the early 2000s when most websites that had rim in them were mine.

608
00:43:41,197 --> 00:43:42,710
Speaker 0: What about the Republican youth majority?

609
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:46,802
Speaker 0: They don't have brand of underwear that brand of underwear.

610
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:57,999
Speaker 1: I feel like I should buy that underwear To give people a perspective back in this day like, you know 1999 when I was like doing this stuff on the internet.

611
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:06,110
Speaker 1: if you searched for rim on the internet You would basically find a bunch of gibberish some of which looked vaguely Gaelic.

612
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:16,943
Speaker 1: You'd find this weird old etymological website that said it was like an old root of Miriam and it From like old Hebrew languages and it didn't really say much else.

613
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:19,090
Speaker 1: and he found all my websites.

614
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:22,409
Speaker 0: Well, you actually found website.

615
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:25,879
Speaker 1: Well, well, well, well, you found websites.

616
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:35,549
Speaker 1: insofar as websites could be found in the year 1999 on Alta Vista You find like broken links to like a geostasis page that I'd gotten rid of stuff like that.

617
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:37,112
Speaker 0: All right.

618
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,460
Speaker 0: So how does this lead into a show topic here?

619
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:47,506
Speaker 1: There are internet ruins all over the place and We did a show a long time ago on ye olde internet and stuff that used to exist on the air.

620
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:48,410
Speaker 1: that doesn't exist anymore.

621
00:44:49,272 --> 00:45:00,712
Speaker 1: And I kind of want to talk about that again because I suddenly like remembered Guess that he's got taken down Yeah and I I remembered guest books and I remembered that there used to be a time when I would go to a website and if It was cool.

622
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:04,287
Speaker 1: I would sign the guest book and be like, hey your website's cool.

623
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:04,929
Speaker 1: I was here.

624
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:07,109
Speaker 0: Why don't we make a Facebook guest book?

625
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:13,829
Speaker 1: There's I think don't like guest books of old but with Facebook doesn't that wall or whatever it is basically do the same thing?

626
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:18,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we can make it so that you can put a wall on a page on the internet.

627
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:24,107
Speaker 1: But isn't that just the same as the side wiki or poop on this website calm or all those things?

628
00:45:24,127 --> 00:45:26,850
Speaker 1: I Guess it's just another place.

629
00:45:28,131 --> 00:45:28,371
Speaker 1: Plus.

630
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:30,839
Speaker 1: can something like that even work in the modern world?

631
00:45:30,879 --> 00:45:38,081
Speaker 1: because back then there were so few people on the internet and the barrier To entry was so high that there was really no shit cocking him.

632
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:40,810
Speaker 1: You made a place that people could post stuff.

633
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,680
Speaker 1: People would honestly post stuff.

634
00:45:44,182 --> 00:45:46,550
Speaker 1: There wasn't even really spam for a long time.

635
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:56,782
Speaker 1: And then like it suddenly there was a bunch of spam and then eventually the spam got kind of overwhelmed by just absolute shitcockery like just just GNA.

636
00:45:57,144 --> 00:46:01,273
Speaker 0: a craziness a GNA.

637
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:03,121
Speaker 0: I saw somebody on the street.

638
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:07,680
Speaker 0: They had one of those grocery push carts Yeah, and it it was it a sticker on.

639
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,010
Speaker 0: it said GNA but it was some other GNA.

640
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:18,059
Speaker 1: But I could if you could die whoever I got a look cuz whoever thinks that they're the GNA They should really change the name because I don't think they know.

641
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,975
Speaker 0: I don't know what was going on there The GNA.

642
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:27,410
Speaker 1: okay, if you search for GNA you still find the actual bad GNA.

643
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:38,723
Speaker 1: Okay Wow, yeah, but the second thing down is the Nashville Something The Greater Nashville Apartment Association.

644
00:46:38,743 --> 00:46:43,890
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, okay So yeah, but I mean what you're saying there about like old ruins of old websites.

645
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,108
Speaker 0: That's sort of what you know, I mean look at something like SourceForge, right?

646
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:58,600
Speaker 0: It's like SourceForge is like where all the open source projects went to die back in the day and like 99% of everything on SourceForge is just some old Project that someone started and never worked on.

647
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:05,363
Speaker 0: and I think what's happening right is because the internet is That you know people used to do things and not finish them.

648
00:47:05,404 --> 00:47:06,990
Speaker 0: We're not very far with them.

649
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,047
Speaker 0: Well, they just had an idea and they started working on it one day But then they stopped and that was it.

650
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:22,501
Speaker 0: the thing is now because people are working on the internet that thing that you The idea you had and worked on for an hour and then never went back to in your whole life It's out there sitting there taking up space.

651
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:23,305
Speaker 0: It's a web page.

652
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:25,313
Speaker 0: Someone can find it Someone can look at it.

653
00:47:25,353 --> 00:47:31,390
Speaker 0: There is you know be on SourceForge or GitHub or Geocities or who knows what?

654
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,959
Speaker 0: It's like they're out there.

655
00:47:33,262 --> 00:47:34,290
Speaker 0: I've got a whole bunch of them.

656
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:47,109
Speaker 1: It's almost like the internet has become so big and it's evolved so much for so long that I mean look around any city like the city grows up and then like parts of it decay and disappear.

657
00:47:47,129 --> 00:47:52,626
Speaker 1: and We basically the Internet's been around for so long that we have ruins just like real cities do and we have.

658
00:47:53,048 --> 00:47:59,130
Speaker 1: like when geocities Went down that was the equivalent of like in the Bronx bulldozing an old abandoned warehouse full of oboes.

659
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:04,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is right is actually the reason I think people don't see these things.

660
00:48:04,765 --> 00:48:06,630
Speaker 0: that often right isn't because they aren't there.

661
00:48:06,752 --> 00:48:07,909
Speaker 0: I think there's more and more of them.

662
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,358
Speaker 0: I think it's because how great Google is?

663
00:48:10,398 --> 00:48:13,710
Speaker 0: Google will just never send you there ever because it's like why the hell would you want?

664
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,178
Speaker 0: To go there.

665
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:25,430
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like imagine if you're in a town in the middle of the town was nice and beautiful and these huge Skyscrapers and with clean and polished and amazing and everything outside the town was like this this slum.

666
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:36,450
Speaker 0: So it was like the infinite slum Even if you sort, you know, there might be some interesting hilarious things out in the slum You know like really creative cool stuff out there.

667
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,445
Speaker 0: But you will never find it because Google will never point you in the slum.

668
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:44,609
Speaker 0: no matter what you want to find It'll always find someplace in the skyscraper for you to go.

669
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:48,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's basically the way it is plus the people.

670
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:51,770
Speaker 1: you know, the old analogy of surfing the web is basically dead.

671
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,315
Speaker 1: No one surfs anymore.

672
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:56,644
Speaker 1: You don't follow links on a path unless you're like on Wikipedia.

673
00:48:56,664 --> 00:48:58,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't need no web ring.

674
00:48:58,995 --> 00:49:00,050
Speaker 1: God right web rings.

675
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,818
Speaker 1: I mean that was how you'd find a lot of weird stuff.

676
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:08,229
Speaker 1: cuz you know web ring you'd follow it and you'd have the pages You found were abandoned or disappeared or broken links or whatever.

677
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:13,557
Speaker 1: Some people would in the web ring take you to a site and they use a frame to like break the web ring and take you Somewhere.

678
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:31,362
Speaker 1: scary you'd find like Exploring the internet used to be like exploring an abandoned building or exploring a building people were using and now we just the internet is kind of Modernified and we don't find that stuff anymore But it's still out there in fact growing and also think about it.

679
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:40,967
Speaker 1: when the internet first kind of got big Very there weren't that many Unmaintained websites and very few people put any thought into like.

680
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:41,710
Speaker 1: what do they do?

681
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,668
Speaker 1: Like they make a website and then if they lost interest in it, they might just forget about it.

682
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,522
Speaker 1: But now there's been so much web siting like we're.

683
00:49:47,803 --> 00:49:52,549
Speaker 1: imagine 20 or 30 years from now I mean penny arcade all this like all the stuff we do.

684
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:54,810
Speaker 1: Will it be maintained forever?

685
00:49:55,010 --> 00:50:01,950
Speaker 1: Not everyone has the ability to create a corporation to ensure the longevity of the things they create on the internet after their deaths.

686
00:50:02,759 --> 00:50:03,630
Speaker 0: You want to see something?

687
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,670
Speaker 0: You want to do something really crazy, maybe?

688
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:09,618
Speaker 0: Okay, so Berkshire Hathaway, right?

689
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:09,959
Speaker 1: I?

690
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:13,090
Speaker 1: well my 401k is invested in that pretty heavily.

691
00:50:13,892 --> 00:50:15,036
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a company.

692
00:50:15,317 --> 00:50:18,226
Speaker 0: It's what the 17th biggest company in the world something like that.

693
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:19,610
Speaker 1: Well, they're complicated.

694
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:29,608
Speaker 1: I mean look on Google Finance look at brk.a that is their primary stock and Look at how many dollars it is to buy one share of that a bajillion, right?

695
00:50:29,648 --> 00:50:32,840
Speaker 0: So Here's I just want to show you something interesting.

Speaker 1: Wow, it looks exactly like the best website in the world in 2001.

701
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,203
Speaker 0: I don't know.

702
00:50:56,224 --> 00:50:57,851
Speaker 0: It looks like the best website in the world in 1998 to me.

703
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:07,303
Speaker 1: I don't know Maybe 2000 because this is because look 1998 it wouldn't have been this polished I know.

704
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:09,410
Speaker 0: and look it looks like it was actually updated.

705
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,560
Speaker 0: I mean look this part was updated in March of 2009.

706
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,780
Speaker 1: Maybe this is like you've got say you've got an old man who's been living in the same house for 60 years.

707
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,831
Speaker 1: He maintains the house very well, but the house still looks like a house.

708
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,235
Speaker 1: That's 60 years old.

709
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:25,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's never renovated it.

710
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:30,220
Speaker 0: He's got the same refrigerator The same manual garage door the same furniture.

711
00:51:31,202 --> 00:51:32,408
Speaker 0: All right, but it all works.

712
00:51:32,468 --> 00:51:33,534
Speaker 0: it's all still there.

713
00:51:33,614 --> 00:51:34,720
Speaker 0: it's all still updated.

714
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,700
Speaker 0: It's the old man still lives there just fine with his old stupid stove.

715
00:51:38,881 --> 00:51:40,979
Speaker 1: I don't know why he has an ad on the website though.

716
00:51:41,904 --> 00:51:43,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's sort of weird, right?

717
00:51:44,922 --> 00:51:46,579
Speaker 1: You really need that money.

718
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:53,910
Speaker 0: I mean like even you know people have ads but I mean like You know like mcdonalds.com doesn't have an ad on the front page.

719
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:57,320
Speaker 1: Microsoft.com does not advertise anything but Microsoft products.

720
00:51:58,501 --> 00:52:00,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see mcdonalds.com.

721
00:52:00,146 --> 00:52:04,539
Speaker 0: yeah, there is no ads on mcdonalds.com that are anything but McDonald's, you know.

722
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:12,220
Speaker 0: But anyway, so yeah I just you know, I mean this is sort of crazy that you can have things like this that are still around.

723
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:17,275
Speaker 0: You know, it's like don't you think that such a big company would have something modern?

724
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:18,740
Speaker 0: but no not really.

725
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:21,819
Speaker 0: They're still using the same old website from a hundred years ago.

726
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:25,080
Speaker 1: But I wonder where this trend is going to lead.

727
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:31,148
Speaker 1: I mean imagine we're gonna get to the points where a lot of the people kind of like how Children of the 80s right now are going through the.

728
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:38,143
Speaker 1: all the celebrities from my childhood are dying because they're getting to that age where people die and every generation kind of goes through that.

729
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:45,018
Speaker 1: but the internet generation is gonna go through that in a really weird way because Stuff doesn't stick around.

730
00:52:45,821 --> 00:52:59,800
Speaker 1: Past your own death unless you have all these legal structures Like you might have like podcasting might have all the skills to do like a podcast about something But if you don't know about technology and about audio and about websites, you still can't really make a good podcast.

731
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:00,944
Speaker 0: Think about that.

732
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:03,434
Speaker 0: think about how many people started podcasts and then stop them.

733
00:53:03,654 --> 00:53:05,160
Speaker 0: think about how many podcasts are out there.

734
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,120
Speaker 0: They're like two episodes five episodes and they're just sitting there with no listeners and eventually they'll disappear on the internet.

735
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,610
Speaker 0: They're there for now on iTunes and find them.

736
00:53:14,051 --> 00:53:17,266
Speaker 1: but like think about geek night say Scott and I, you know We know about technology.

737
00:53:17,286 --> 00:53:37,320
Speaker 1: So we got geek nights like really good technology wise Let's say we didn't know anything about Like corporations or money or anything like that and we never incorporated and we never like set up all the structures the meta structures that would survive us and continue the geek nights or at least you know, Like I'll trust to ensure that geek night stayed online forever like the archive website.

738
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:42,975
Speaker 1: So then what if we died, you know and eventually at least Scott will die.

739
00:53:42,995 --> 00:53:47,886
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll be I won't die but Ever but Eventually will die.

740
00:53:47,907 --> 00:53:54,896
Speaker 1: and then geek nights would eventually, you know all the websites we created like the legal custody of that might go to our families or something.

741
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:58,911
Speaker 1: if we didn't set the wheels up Ride and it eventually would all corrode and disappear.

742
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:01,320
Speaker 1: disappear unless someone saved it with money in law.

743
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:04,107
Speaker 0: So that's an archive that argues about.

744
00:54:04,148 --> 00:54:04,931
Speaker 0: but think about it.

745
00:54:05,172 --> 00:54:15,739
Speaker 1: That's the only people doing it one person And most of the internet has not only no legal wherewithal but no technological wherewithal.

746
00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:25,819
Speaker 1: I Mean myspace and Facebook in places like that are just now barely Getting to the point of setting up structures to handle that sort of thing.

747
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:35,670
Speaker 0: and I mean you look at things like parthenon and sphinxes and pyramids and castles, right it's like There it's a there it's like on the internet.

748
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:44,040
Speaker 0: people put houses and it's not even you know 20 years old 30 years old in terms of public access and already they're completely gone.

749
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,619
Speaker 0: You know all of Geocities were totally wiped out.

750
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:55,600
Speaker 1: Yeah As we Peter off into silence, I don't think there's that much else to say and I'm really really hungry and Skype always makes this difficult.

751
00:54:56,525 --> 00:54:59,658
Speaker 0: Yeah Anything else going on by you there?

752
00:55:00,403 --> 00:55:01,811
Speaker 1: And I really I want to get some dinner.

753
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:06,474
Speaker 1: my house is basically this weird because I'm the only one living in it.

754
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:06,816
Speaker 1: really.

755
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:12,040
Speaker 1: so Nothing moves unless I move it and it's an interesting experience that I have not had for a long time.

756
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:16,296
Speaker 1: Things not moving is a strange experience.

757
00:55:16,718 --> 00:55:27,011
Speaker 1: like You did move a lot of things at least in the downstairs of the house All around the living room my stuff would move and now just nothing moves.

758
00:55:28,937 --> 00:55:34,880
Speaker 0: I Things moving or not moving in my apartment here the other thing and it's not related to Monday at all.

759
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,715
Speaker 1: But today I was looking at the board games and I really wanted to play a board game.

760
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,730
Speaker 0: I Also really want to play a board game.

761
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,500
Speaker 0: Maybe you should come over play some board game.

762
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,044
Speaker 1: Oh, we got zinc.

763
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:46,320
Speaker 1: I would get something for me to sleep on and I'll come over.

764
00:55:47,362 --> 00:55:48,712
Speaker 0: Help me on how lend me some money.

765
00:55:48,753 --> 00:55:49,458
Speaker 0: I'll buy that couch.

766
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:52,374
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna buy an inflated mattress and leave it at your apartment.

767
00:55:52,977 --> 00:55:53,419
Speaker 0: You could do that.

768
00:55:53,802 --> 00:55:55,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, that'd be pretty good to be something to lay on.

769
00:55:55,934 --> 00:55:56,679
Speaker 0: while watching this TV.

770
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:01,130
Speaker 1: We have a zinc icon other than the panels we're doing.

771
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,716
Speaker 1: I pretty much am just going to sit and play board games and burning wheel with people.

772
00:56:05,503 --> 00:56:06,367
Speaker 0: Sounds good to me.

773
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,332
Speaker 0: Sounds good to me.

774
00:56:07,392 --> 00:56:07,754
Speaker 0: Yeah.

775
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:12,805
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I think we're done here Fast karate for the geek nights.

776
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:17,237
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep saying that until we get better technology technological solutions to these.

777
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:17,578
Speaker 1: Skype.

778
00:56:17,598 --> 00:56:18,922
Speaker 1: Scott in I ordered a.

779
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:23,676
Speaker 0: I ordered a headset but that's better than this Xbox 360 headset that I'm using but it's not.

780
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:37,410
Speaker 1: it's not like an expensive Thinking about so maybe doing a Thursday episode where you know since we're skyping anyway Maybe we'll Skype someone else in in addition to us and do some sort of roundtable or something or another Profile and geek like we were doing for a while.

781
00:56:38,033 --> 00:56:39,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's get some people going on.

782
00:56:39,741 --> 00:56:40,825

790
00:56:54,417 --> 00:56:56,739
Speaker 1: Yeah We get him to sit still for five minutes.

791
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,068
Speaker 0: Let's get someone who's less trouble.

792
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:00,917
Speaker 1: Who's less troublesome?

793
00:57:00,957 --> 00:57:01,480
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson.

794
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:03,683
Speaker 0: Not a bad choice.

795
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:11,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at Scott Johnson on after the election because uh, I don't want to sabotage his electoral aims.

796
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:16,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do love though, you know, we're talking about all these words to resign after hitting, you know.

797
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:18,499
Speaker 1: instead We're talking to old people in government, right?

798
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,565
Speaker 1: So to cover up the fact that he's so crazy young compared to everyone else in the government You know what?

799
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:31,957
Speaker 1: His article says the official article Scott Johnson a Hatboro area resident for 29 years.

800
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:37,479
Speaker 1: Mmm, cuz he's 29 years old that he was born in Hatboro.

801
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:42,992
Speaker 1: Yep, but notice how they sidestep that and try to make him sound older than 29 years old.

802
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,137
Speaker 1: It's clever clever girl ever.

803
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:47,062
Speaker 0: Yeah That's fine.

804
00:57:47,082 --> 00:57:54,929
