00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:12,619
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:22,049
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight the penny arcade exposition part 1 Friday.

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,338
Speaker 1: Hello, people's you have found us.

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,285
Speaker 0: Congratulations, you win.

00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:36,229
Speaker 0: winner is you.

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,100
Speaker 0: we're working nights for all you new people.

9
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:44,798
Speaker 1: I hope you know that before you clicked on whatever you just clicked on yeah because otherwise a ricker all might have been waiting.

10
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:53,770
Speaker 0: but Real briefly of course to all our normal listeners of course we're back from the west coast back in the Safe and wanting harbors of the East Coast.

11
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,320
Speaker 1: hmm nice Atlantic Ocean.

12
00:00:57,103 --> 00:00:59,020
Speaker 0: You know we didn't even get to see the Pacific Ocean.

13
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,125
Speaker 1: Well, it's so it's.

14
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:03,360
Speaker 1: actually I thought Seattle was like odd in the Pacific Ocean, but I was wrong.

15
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:07,940
Speaker 1: I had only looked at maps that were too zoomed out to realize yeah, well you learned something.

16
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,640
Speaker 1: But now I learned I slept to see this new Pacific Ocean.

17
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:20,827
Speaker 0: But real briefly for all you new people and I know there's a lot of you because we met a lot of you and there were like 58,000 people at PAX, but Geek nights four nights a week.

18
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,234
Speaker 0: This is Tuesday night.

19
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,460
Speaker 0: geek nights talk about gaming.

20
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,706
Speaker 0: we have other nights of the week.

21
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:31,350
Speaker 0: you can figure all that out from the closer bit if you don't want to hear about it now and In case you're wondering why this episode came out on a Wednesday night.

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,200
Speaker 0: That's just because we were fucking wrecked last night.

23
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,045
Speaker 1: It happens sometimes.

24
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:39,740
Speaker 1: I mean you try doing a show four nights a week and see how far that gets you.

25
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:44,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially because packs I mean for many of you packs was like the the event of the summer.

26
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:48,903
Speaker 0: for us packs was the last of many conventions Isn't New York?

27
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,009
Speaker 1: and a festival in three weeks.

28
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:50,692
Speaker 0: quiet you.

29
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:52,380
Speaker 0: I don't want to do it about that.

30
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,028
Speaker 0: Oh my god, so I'm like that.

31
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 1: and then what you know cuts the constant February.

32
00:01:56,682 --> 00:02:00,759
Speaker 0: But if you're here that means you probably enjoyed at least something we did at PAX.

33
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:03,131
Speaker 0: So uh you'll probably enjoy this.

34
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,363
Speaker 0: but in case you don't well I don't know.

35
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:08,060
Speaker 1: you can keep listening or just never listen again.

36
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:09,654
Speaker 1: Don't like it don't listen.

37
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:13,980
Speaker 0: however This is the point where normally we talk about gaming news of some kind.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,700
Speaker 0: But I realized we've got like eight hours of packs coverage in our brains and like an hour or so to do it in the show.

39
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,329
Speaker 0: So I think we just got to move right along.

40
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:24,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have to go to bed at some point tonight.

41
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:26,139
Speaker 0: All right, take work off tomorrow.

42
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:38,906
Speaker 1: so you want to just do it will do the things of the day and then we'll just do packs and With that things of the day.

43
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,540
Speaker 0: I think this bit for all you new listeners once again is kind of self-explanatory.

44
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:51,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, my thing of the day You know, I'll often make comments, you know about games mostly memoir pugas as the Yahtzee is known to say, right?

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,880
Speaker 0: You know, we did just talk about Eve online.

46
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:55,382
Speaker 1: They did.

47
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:56,727
Speaker 1: Okay, go check that out.

48
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:59,155
Speaker 0: It was pretty exactly what I thought.

49
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:00,099
Speaker 1: I didn't see that yet.

50
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:06,100
Speaker 1: But anyway You know, so I often make fun of those games and saying it's just a database.

51
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,679
Speaker 1: All you're doing is changing, you know data in a database somewhere like when someone buys money in.

52
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,417
Speaker 1: Wow They're basically paying someone to basically type in.

53
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:20,299
Speaker 1: Update set gold equals number where user ID equals them.

54
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:32,840
Speaker 0: Except the guy won't type that until you play a grindy minigame for like a thousand hours or give a bunch of money to someone In China, well, but then that guy does the grinding minigame for thousands of hours and the ultimate parody of this, right?

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,820
Speaker 1: Someone has made a game called MySQL game and really the MySQL game is not a MySQL game.

56
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,500
Speaker 1: I tried to do some injections to sort of mess with the game.

57
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:50,600
Speaker 1: What it is is basically an upgrading game that has the interface of SQL.

58
00:03:50,720 --> 00:04:08,420
Speaker 1: It's like they'll have all these queries like instead of having a button that says, you know upgrade weapon They'll have a button that says update weapon, you know set attack equal attack plus one and Set user fuel You know points minus one.

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,340
Speaker 1: So it's basically you can type in the number to change the degree of the thing.

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,500
Speaker 0: So it's basically the same joke as progress quest only with a little a different kind of ironic little to it.

61
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,149
Speaker 1: Well, you do do something in this game.

62
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:28,642
Speaker 1: I mean, it's basically a Spend resources game to upgrade stuff game where the interface looks like SQL Resource.

63
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:29,947
Speaker 0: could I possibly be spending?

64
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:30,870
Speaker 0: I'm taking this.

65
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,288
Speaker 1: but because in in your user table they have you know, you have a row.

66
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,314
Speaker 1: you start with one row.

67
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:43,680
Speaker 1: that's your user row and One thing starts out as like a high number and all the other queries force that number to go down when you use them.

68
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,499
Speaker 0: But couldn't I just put in a query to make that number go back up?

69
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,791
Speaker 1: No, you can't type in whatever you want.

70
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,810
Speaker 1: when you see it You'll understand what I'm talking about, but it's an agent.

71
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,259
Speaker 1: It's interesting for the message not for the game.

72
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:56,885
Speaker 0: What message?

73
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,154
Speaker 0: it's the same message as progress quest.

74
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:00,900
Speaker 1: it's a slightly different message than progress.

75
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,065
Speaker 0: I think it's the same message.

76
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,840
Speaker 0: progress quest says that you don't even need to be doing this, right?

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,126
Speaker 1: Well, this says it's just a database.

78
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:13,120
Speaker 1: So you combine the two progress quest and MySQL game and you get the reality.

79
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:21,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you couldn't tell we don't really like the memoir because that much but it's all tough Love because I played the realm for like three freaking years.

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,519
Speaker 1: I played mad muds back in the day.

81
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:29,180
Speaker 0: That was all just fluff to get out of the way partly because I don't want to edit my post-production script.

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,209
Speaker 0: It's time to talk about packs now.

83
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,333
Speaker 1: Did you do your thing today?

84
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:33,860
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess I do everything today.

85
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,540
Speaker 0: Well, my thing of the day is a spoiler for pack.

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,360
Speaker 0: So if you did not read packs coverage and you just live under a rock and you don't know What happened at the end of the Omega thon?

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,520
Speaker 0: Well, uh wait until the end of the show before you watch my thing of the day because I had to show you this video.

88
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,445
Speaker 0: I don't Explaining it does not do it justice.

89
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:57,420
Speaker 0: You have to see the way the crowd reacted to the final round of the Omega thon.

90
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,814
Speaker 1: I have video of this but it's 1.6 gigs.

91
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,160
Speaker 1: It's actually really good video.

92
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,415
Speaker 1: I'm like my arm was getting tired while taking the video.

93
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,679
Speaker 1: So I thought it was bad But actually I watched it and it came out really well.

94
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got to find a way to upload it.

95
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:17,400
Speaker 1: somehow mines a little bit of shaky cam here But that's what you get is a tiny bit of shaky cam, but not a lot less than I thought it was gonna have.

96
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one I got is pretty bad.

97
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,931
Speaker 0: I just went on YouTube and tried to find like the best one.

98
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:22,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll try to get mine uploaded.

99
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:23,905
Speaker 0: It was tricky cuz.

100
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,240
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean you had to get the build-up to it.

101
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,223
Speaker 0: You couldn't just show it.

102
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:28,965
Speaker 0: the build-up was.

103
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:33,900
Speaker 1: I got the whole thing from no one's on stage to go home.

104
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:38,980
Speaker 0: So so that includes sit your ass on that beanbag such as the BBS, right?

105
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,340
Speaker 1: I think the exact quote was get your ass in the beanbags.

106
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:59,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, you know before we can talk about packs 2008 We have to talk a little bit about the backstory about Little Mac working his way up to this because When packs first happened and you know We're not gonna talk about Fanny arcade or the history of facts or Necro Wamba con or anything.

107
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,628
Speaker 0: But when the first packs was announced, I remember thinking wow That'd be pretty cool If it wasn't on the other side of the planet.

108
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,040
Speaker 0: as far as I'm concerned cuz I'm pouring in college I'd probably go when packs is announced.

109
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:16,560
Speaker 1: I just knew that is the convention that I must go to and that is where the awesomeness is happening.

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,200
Speaker 1: But at the time I had not the means to go not the vacation days nor the fun.

111
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,195
Speaker 0: So you realize the truth is that you didn't really want it.

112
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,040
Speaker 0: I didn't want it.

113
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,589
Speaker 1: It's the same reason I haven't picked up a pigeon.

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're sitting there, you know, all right.

115
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:32,178
Speaker 0: but then we start hearing these spotty reports from people who were out there.

116
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:36,907
Speaker 1: and Wasn't spotty reports Direct from the horse's mouth.

117
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:37,751
Speaker 0: I say spotty.

118
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:42,199
Speaker 0: I mean like ten minutes into it There were reports coming back that it was awesome.

119
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:55,910
Speaker 1: Basically everything all the news that came out of packs and all the descriptions of what it occurred at the first second third and fourth Packs is none of which we attended Convinced me absolutely 100% that this is the convention to end.

120
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:59,580
Speaker 0: all I mean the concerts alone would have been worth flying out there.

121
00:08:00,382 --> 00:08:09,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially they talk about these spiritual experience of what it occurred at the packs and I knew I was missing out on something And I had a lifelong regret ahead of me.

122
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:11,365
Speaker 1: There's nothing I could do.

123
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:16,206
Speaker 0: so we said next year we should go and then the next year came and we had neither money nor Times or we didn't go.

124
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:18,820
Speaker 0: and then the next year came and we had neither money nor time.

125
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:28,595
Speaker 0: Then the next year came and we probably could have gone but we justified not go and saying that ah, it's too expensive We'll just go to Otacon and Katsucon and all these things instead.

126
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:32,379
Speaker 0: and then the next year We still didn't fucking go because we're just morons at this point.

127
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:38,019
Speaker 0: So this year we said we're going no matter what it was about one year ago.

128
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:46,675
Speaker 0: today After the previous packs went on the show We committed in fact I wasn't really ready to come in and we kind of forced ourselves live on geek night

129
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:49,503
Speaker 1: committed and forced you into it saying We're going to packs no

130
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,225
Speaker 0: matter what

131
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,936
Speaker 1: come the hells and the high waters and high waters actually came to some other people.

132
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:57,854
Speaker 0: Oh Too soon too soon.

133
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:06,096
Speaker 0: So we committed on the air and then we put that episode up with no Retraction that we were going to go to packs and nothing was going to stop us.

134
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:09,888
Speaker 1: and so To not shit talk we did.

135
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,954
Speaker 1: we went yeah packs.

136
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:18,319
Speaker 0: and uh, I Don't want to spoil what we're gonna say for the next hour or two or however long this is gonna take.

137
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:22,920
Speaker 0: but packs was like the best goddamn convention I've ever been to.

138
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:26,108
Speaker 0: Yeah shows over that's pretty much it.

139
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:26,910
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

140
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,596
Speaker 0: You shouldn't need pretty.

141
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:36,620
Speaker 0: I'll say this if you like Games and I noticed I didn't say video games if you like games you need to go to packs.

142
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,920
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if you're like a candy land fanatic or if you're like a Starcraft fanatic.

143
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:43,926
Speaker 1: It's all good at pack.

144
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,452
Speaker 0: You don't need to like penny arcade.

145
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:48,344
Speaker 0: You don't even know a penny arcade is just go It's packs.

146
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:49,128
Speaker 0: It's it's a.

147
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:51,900
Speaker 1: knowing what penny arcade is helps a little bit, but it's not necessary.

148
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:55,611
Speaker 0: So, uh thus the odyssey of packs.

149
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:57,980
Speaker 0: now, of course, we've never been to the west coast.

150
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,984
Speaker 0: We've never been to see.

151
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:02,840
Speaker 0: I've never been west of Michigan until not that long before packs.

152
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:20,516
Speaker 1: You know if you judged conventions only by the life of Scott then you could come up with an equation that says as Longitude as a longitude of Convention goes west convention quality increases.

153
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:26,602
Speaker 0: Yes However, that does not go the same for road trips because the worst road trip we ever went on took us west That's true.

154
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:31,520
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the cool thing and I gotta say this, you know, we do geek knives.

155
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:43,138
Speaker 0: we've been doing this for a long time and Because you know most cons like we go to these anime cons and it's like hey con We'll do a bunch of panels for you We'll do events for you and then con says okay come and then we book and we go.

156
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:45,828
Speaker 0: Packs was we're going no matter what.

157
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,734
Speaker 0: and then it much later.

158
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,360
Speaker 0: I said, hey, maybe we should do a panel.

159
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:50,563
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't.

160
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:51,586
Speaker 1: hey, we should do a panel.

161
00:10:51,626 --> 00:11:00,253
Speaker 1: It's hey, they're allowing pan other there, you know putting out a request for panel applications You know, so we sent one in of course as we do.

162
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,120
Speaker 1: yeah, they gave us one and we had one.

163
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,080
Speaker 0: But the really cool thing is that you know, we do geek night.

164
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:08,900
Speaker 0: So as a result, we actually there were a lot of people on the West Coast.

165
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,700
Speaker 0: We kind of knew because they're in our forums They listen to our show and unlike going to other conventions where you're coming in out of the blue.

166
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,140
Speaker 0: You got to meet people from nowhere and kind of forge your posse out of nothing.

167
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:26,300
Speaker 0: We got there and we were greeted at the airport by row one of our awesome listeners and her boyfriend who?

168
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:32,120
Speaker 0: I just want to point out was holding up a geek night sign with like us doing the Carmel dancing on it at the airport.

169
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:37,579
Speaker 0: It was like a cross between Sir's car is waiting and oh my god geeks.

170
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing about that sign is I don't think I was had any pants in that depiction.

171
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,131
Speaker 0: Most definitely did not have any pants on that poster.

172
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not so good.

173
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:47,340
Speaker 0: That was fantastic.

174
00:11:49,162 --> 00:11:50,288
Speaker 1: Room likes you with no pants.

175
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:50,811
Speaker 1: Okay.

176
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,300
Speaker 0: So yeah, you know little details.

177
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:58,479
Speaker 0: We stayed at the red line because red lion sounded like some sort of communist awesome and I couldn't pass that up.

178
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,207
Speaker 1: Is that really why you picked it?

179
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:01,352
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the only real.

180
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,466
Speaker 0: All right, basically, you know I don't know the West Coast.

181
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:05,952
Speaker 0: I go to the PAX website.

182
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,438
Speaker 0: They're like these are the hotels.

183
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:10,145
Speaker 0: I'm like, uh Google Maps, where are they?

184
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:11,509
Speaker 0: and the red line?

185
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,100
Speaker 0: one red line that that was one point two free internet.

186
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:16,550
Speaker 0: So, all right wet line, whatever.

187
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,905
Speaker 0: I don't even know where it was But it worked out.

188
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:25,232
Speaker 1: I would have I would have picked one with a you know A brand name just to be know that it was quality.

189
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,580
Speaker 1: who knows red line could have been anything.

190
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,814
Speaker 0: I I went on a hunch and I was right.

191
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,162
Speaker 0: The red line was awesome All right.

192
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:32,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, we just went to bed.

193
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:32,835
Speaker 0: what we got in it?

194
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,529
Speaker 1: like 1 a.m And the next day it was time for packs.

195
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,055
Speaker 1: We woke up packs time.

196
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:38,275
Speaker 1: Nope.

197
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:43,833
Speaker 1: We had reverse jet lag So we were ready to go but packs didn't start until 2 p.m.

198
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:45,057
Speaker 1: On Friday p.m 2 p.m.

199
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,452
Speaker 0: Oticon starts at like 9 on Friday.

200
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,839
Speaker 0: I didn't know what to do.

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Speaker 1: I mean every convention on the East Coast every anime convention at least that has a Friday.

202
00:12:54,501 --> 00:13:01,116
Speaker 1: The Friday is a full day The Saturday is a full day and the Sunday is just starts early but just ends a little early.

203
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:05,168
Speaker 1: so everyone can go home Friday starting at 2 p.m What the fuck?

204
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:10,230
Speaker 1: I mean that's too early for people to be home from work yet But it's still way late.

205
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,336
Speaker 1: You wasted the whole morning.

206
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:11,799
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

207
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:18,744
Speaker 0: So, of course wake up and I did something I've never done at nanomek on before one got a real breakfast Time.

208
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:29,262
Speaker 1: we had to kill before - so we were wandering out eaten Looking at stuff talking to people walking around looking around figuring our way around thing Discovering the.

209
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:32,273
Speaker 0: Seattle is a strange and foreign place where no one jaywalks, but us.

210
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,280
Speaker 1: it's basically a big shopping mall almost.

211
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:44,773
Speaker 0: But the one thing I can say is that walking around Seattle at like 10 a.m Now packs, you know The attendees of packs are not like the attendees of other accounts we go to.

212
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:51,860
Speaker 0: and yet at the same time You could point out with like a 95 percent accuracy 99 whether or not a person.

213
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,390
Speaker 0: well Some of the people we saw were just hipsters.

214
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:55,233
Speaker 0: That's true.

215
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:56,800
Speaker 0: who happened to live in Seattle?

216
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:59,587
Speaker 0: One of them was a hobo who happened to be hipster.

217
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:04,607
Speaker 0: ish, but pretty much everyone else who was like, that's a packs, dude That's a packs girl.

218
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:07,120
Speaker 0: Those people are all totally packs people.

219
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:16,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is even like later on after packs is over you could still tell from the remaining people in town Who is someone left over from packs and who wasn't?

220
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're wandering around Seattle.

221
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,918
Speaker 0: We got like a half mile from the convention center like the wrong direction, you know bomb the wrong place.

222
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,671
Speaker 0: and yet There were packs people everywhere.

223
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,560
Speaker 0: The city was diffused with packs.

224
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:31,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, the packs who pretty much owned the town for three days.

225
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:38,180
Speaker 0: So, you know, we're walking around and we're thinking all right Are people gonna line up like what's the registration status?

226
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,720
Speaker 0: I mean, I know they may allow badges to people who pre-register but something that other conventions seem to worry a lot about.

227
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:47,916
Speaker 0: So how many people get mean like how many people could have possibly pre-registered?

228
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:48,458
Speaker 0: What's the?

229
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:49,020
Speaker 0: what's the deal?

230
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,268
Speaker 0: What's the line gonna be like?

231
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,860
Speaker 0: let's go to the convention center early.

232
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:56,663
Speaker 1: So we go to the convention center pretty early all mostly because we want to check out our VIP badge situation.

233
00:14:56,703 --> 00:15:05,008
Speaker 0: yes, cuz actually it was cool that you know packs treated us as professionally as Professional for-profit money cons treat us.

234
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,414
Speaker 0: they were like to get your badges.

235
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:09,600
Speaker 0: go to the VIP booth on the fourth floor.

236
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,659
Speaker 1: We walked in and we met this.

237
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,680
Speaker 1: We bumped into a bunch of enforcers right away and they were awesome and they helped us.

238
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:20,285
Speaker 0: They hooked us up right away in stark Contrast to most other conventions.

239
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:35,637
Speaker 0: we walk in and we see an enforcer and they're blocked and basically there's a bunch of enforcers stand at The elevator escalator not letting anyone who doesn't have a badge go up there and we're like Okay, VIP badges and the guy doesn't say you gotta ask so-and-so and point like most cons do.

240
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:43,234
Speaker 1: the guy says oh I'll walk you over there Yep, and there are two other enforcers that were still there.

241
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,860
Speaker 1: So nothing was getting understaffed.

242
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,060
Speaker 1: It was all good and the line was like one dude.

243
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:58,700
Speaker 0: There was one dude in front of us in this line And I noticed that next to us is the normal reg line and there were maybe ten people in that line.

244
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:00,207
Speaker 1: That line empty was.

245
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:07,820
Speaker 1: basically the normal reg line was empty Totally empty because everyone got their badges mailed to them in advance.

246
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:15,260
Speaker 0: There was no one there and yet the people who were there it was like walk-up badge walk-up badge walk-up badge.

247
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:25,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there was a will call and the will call had a little bit of a line But it's basically one booth the will call booth and the line was no bigger than the line.

248
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,020
Speaker 1: You'll see it like the movie theater.

249
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:39,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I don't want to talk a lot about us and our BS but no we had our guest panelists like special Whatever badges, but what we didn't bother with like, you know to come we had the panelist thing And we also had the press thing and all those things.

250
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,320
Speaker 0: I learned something really cool.

251
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,592
Speaker 0: Pax had like 500 media badges.

252
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:49,208
Speaker 0: they gave out, you know, press Media badges got you nothing.

253
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,560
Speaker 0: In fact, our special badge got us nothing either.

254
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:55,027
Speaker 0: So the Kotaku get like all the press.

255
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,300
Speaker 0: people for the most part did not get anything over a dude with a three-day badge.

256
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:07,346
Speaker 1: I think I read somewhere on Kotaku that like only one of them actually got like a yellow badge and everyone else got normal Badges of all people.

257
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:11,689
Speaker 0: the way Pax does it is pretty much the press get comped badges But that's all they get and they have.

258
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,244
Speaker 1: I don't even know if they got comped badges They might have I don't know.

259
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:17,040
Speaker 0: Well, some of the press I talked to said that they got comped badges.

260
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,859
Speaker 0: All right, because the comp badges didn't get you anything.

261
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:36,180
Speaker 0: But uh, you know and I got a backtrack a little bit when we're walking toward the convention center Which is like this giant glass edifice and also walking toward the convention center There was like this row of Pax banners in the street leading up to it.

262
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,131
Speaker 1: You know how the streets will hang like, you know These banners and all this on all the lights on the street to sort of oh my god.

263
00:17:42,151 --> 00:17:42,894
Speaker 0: film festival.

264
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:46,200
Speaker 0: or please pretend our city's Awesome, right?

265
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:48,008
Speaker 1: They had a bunch of.

266
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:54,160
Speaker 0: they said Pax and they were all over the place and It really made me know like I was part of something.

267
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,200
Speaker 1: What other convention have I ever been to that was big enough to have those?

268
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,429
Speaker 1: Otakon doesn't even have those in the Baltimore City.

269
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,839
Speaker 0: Otakon had like a sign outside once and that was it.

270
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, but sorry.

271
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:07,985
Speaker 0: and then we're walking toward the convention center thinking All right Let's see what kind of line there is.

272
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:15,212
Speaker 0: and I see this like kind of big line of people outside the convention center And I'm like, oh, I guess there is a red line, huh?

273
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:17,640
Speaker 0: No, that was the line for the stupid crepes.

274
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:20,088
Speaker 0: There was this crepe place outside the convention traps.

275
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:21,312
Speaker 1: All right that the old.

276
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:23,740
Speaker 1: there's a crepe place in the Atlantic City one of them.

277
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,516
Speaker 1: Right, it's all right.

278
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:27,880
Speaker 1: They're like four crepe different crepe places.

279
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,183
Speaker 1: I saw in Seattle.

280
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:39,420
Speaker 1: crepes are mad popular there and the place outside of the convention center directly attached to it was crepe voila and They had a line the entire convention.

281
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:48,500
Speaker 1: people could have just walked down to the other crepe place in The the food court of the mall got in a crepe and been back faster than waiting in that line.

282
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:50,509
Speaker 0: But not only is that like the line never ended.

283
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,960
Speaker 0: like every time I enter or leave the convention center I see this giant line there.

284
00:18:55,321 --> 00:19:04,000
Speaker 0: But right next to them were these punk kids with a bunch of gameboys network together with cables and a bunch of speakers and amps Playing music and dancing.

285
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, chip to street performance of chip tunes pretty good.

286
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,140
Speaker 0: It was pretty badass and the music was pretty good.

287
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,450
Speaker 0: I gotta say it really I felt that bionic commando kind of vibe going.

288
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, they definitely had some nice effects.

289
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:22,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but alright, so, you know enforcers badges we got our little con bag and of course, what do we do?

290
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:36,092
Speaker 0: We try to wander around as kind of like in a Zelda game where as soon as you get an item You wander around as far as that item will take you getting it as far as you can in every direction Before you start solving all the puzzles to get the next item, right?

291
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,820
Speaker 1: So it was nowhere near two o'clock.

292
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:40,416
Speaker 1: So basically the nothing in the con was open.

293
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:41,140
Speaker 1: We couldn't go anywhere.

294
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,974
Speaker 1: He couldn't go in the annex where the tabletop action was.

295
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:45,260
Speaker 1: He couldn't go in the expo room.

296
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:51,560
Speaker 1: We could I think wait in line to get into the con which I didn't really want to do at all You know.

297
00:19:51,841 --> 00:20:00,287
Speaker 0: So so we went up the escalators as far as we could go to this like top floor where apparently there was some Pegs didn't even have the whole convention center.

298
00:20:00,488 --> 00:20:02,936
Speaker 0: The top floor had this gender Odyssey conference.

299
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:04,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was sort of freaky.

300
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, it won't freaky because packs really needed that space.

301
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:08,676
Speaker 0: I mean there were like 58,000 people there.

302
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,686
Speaker 0: That's like two Oda cons.

303
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the panel rooms that packs are effectively in the hallways.

304
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:18,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know we go all the way up there and we bust out the bag.

305
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:19,998
Speaker 0: now the con bag.

306
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:28,780
Speaker 0: the con swag Had a lot of stuff in it Which made me remember Realize that the anime industry at least is not doing so well because you don't get so much in those bags anymore.

307
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh - con like oh - oh three maybe oh four.

308
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,518
Speaker 1: that con bag was full of stuff loaded.

309
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:37,326
Speaker 1: now It's like an empty barren wasteland.

310
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:40,015
Speaker 1: The packs bag was loaded with shit.

311
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,278
Speaker 1: I have all the shit right here.

312
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,439
Speaker 0: It was like overflowing with shit.

313
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:48,640
Speaker 1: Most of it is just like, you know, freaking flyers advertising stuff.

314
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,627
Speaker 1: But there were a few good things in there.

315
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:54,100
Speaker 1: First of all, you got a precipice of darkness demo disc.

316
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,187
Speaker 1: I already bought that game.

317
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,237
Speaker 1: So I didn't do demo disc but other people do.

318
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:04,211
Speaker 0: yeah I don't want to talk about all the ads in it But I got to say the little kind of thing talking about fallout 3.

319
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,960
Speaker 0: I really like the graphic design of this thing.

320
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:19,511
Speaker 1: That's the only ad worth mentioning was the fallout 3 card because it's like hey Saturday at 2 30 the main theater come see the demo and on the other side it says come to booth seat 632 and Fallout 3 was all over this convention.

321
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:20,958
Speaker 1: Yeah more on that later.

322
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,238
Speaker 1: Yes So also in the bag World of Warcraft trial edition, we don't have enough of those.

323
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:28,309
Speaker 0: All right Well, I think we have four.

324
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,304
Speaker 1: Yeah one up Network Temporary tattoos.

325
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:35,878
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there were a lot of temporary tattoos too, but more on that later.

326
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,894
Speaker 1: Yep There was a PAX 10 audience choice award ballot.

327
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:59,015
Speaker 1: now the PAX 10 Which is basically they pick 10 independent games and there's an area in the expo room where you can play them all and then You vote on which one you like by punching a hole and then you put it in the ballot box at that booth in the expo room Exhibition room or whatever and you vote on which one you like the most.

328
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:03,028
Speaker 1: and I think the winner Winners will be announced at the pack site after the show.

329
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:10,108
Speaker 1: So speaking of the participatory stuff, which is a word rim cannot pronounce They had this DTS thing.

330
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,452
Speaker 1: you might have heard about this before.

331
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 1: basically the way this works distributed tournament system.

332
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:14,723
Speaker 1: Right.

333
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:20,700
Speaker 1: the way this works is in your bag You get this there's a little ziplock baggie a tiny one the kind that you might store.

334
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:33,528
Speaker 1: You know pieces of a board game in and there's a slip of paper and two buttons pins if you will tiny circular ones that have a PAX logo on them and You put these pins on you.

335
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:37,960
Speaker 1: and when you put the pins on that means I am accepting challenges.

336
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:43,859
Speaker 1: If you see someone else with pins and you are also wearing pins you get two of these to start with.

337
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,085
Speaker 1: You can challenge them now.

338
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:51,700
Speaker 0: It pretty much says challenge anyone to any game for one badge, right?

339
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,613
Speaker 1: So you challenge someone to something.

340
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:54,319
Speaker 1: so I say rim.

341
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:56,427
Speaker 1: We actually mean rim had a challenge.

342
00:22:56,467 --> 00:23:00,580
Speaker 1: the challenge was who will first see the red dragon t-shirt?

343
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:01,668
Speaker 1: See it you win.

344
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,708
Speaker 0: if you don't know what we're talking about it's Iconic of D&D nerds.

345
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:07,780
Speaker 0: It is that red dragon t-shirt.

346
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:10,884
Speaker 0: I did not see a single person with it and good God Did I look.

347
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,920
Speaker 1: I looked really hard because I wanted to win.

348
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:16,158
Speaker 1: I saved one of these pins the whole time just to try to win.

349
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:20,580
Speaker 0: now The idea is that you know someone at the end of the con is gonna have a bag full of these things.

350
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,780
Speaker 0: Right me a lot of people are gonna ignore it.

351
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:25,009
Speaker 1: You know a lot of people are gonna play.

352
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,900
Speaker 1: some people are gonna pull together with all their friends.

353
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:33,320
Speaker 0: I saw a dude wearing like a vest and he had like 60 of those things just pinned to it.

354
00:23:33,782 --> 00:23:35,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just go around challenging people.

355
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:37,880
Speaker 1: now the people can refuse your challenge, you know.

356
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:47,000
Speaker 1: So if rim says Scott, let's play carcass own for one pin I could say no, but then I'm also losing cuz I'm also missing out on the chance to win rims badge.

357
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,458
Speaker 1: You know if someone challenges you and you accept you might get one from them instead of giving one to them.

358
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:52,839
Speaker 1: now.

359
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,067
Speaker 0: one We realize two things.

360
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:59,755
Speaker 0: I wanted to walk around just like Challenging people to like parkour or arm wrestling or punch for punch.

361
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:09,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and two We totally could have been griefers and go around and find the people who are really trying to win it and challenge them to A game that they don't realize will take forever.

362
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:17,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean games that take a long time are really gonna hurt you if you're trying to win this You know because basically the idea is to get lots of them in this 50.

363
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,567
Speaker 1: There's like a hundred thousand of these buttons to get.

364
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:25,900
Speaker 1: so if the con really did have 50,000 attendees like they say they do But this I just think this was a really cool.

365
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:30,584
Speaker 0: I mean I've seen similar things like it at other gaming cons before but Pax was really.

366
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,460
Speaker 0: you could see the spirit of this with people throwing down challenges left and right.

367
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:43,300
Speaker 1: Yep, generally what happened was anyone anytime people played a game somewhere and they thought of it They did it, you know, like people would play a board game and they say hey, you know what?

368
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,300
Speaker 0: Whoever wins gets everyone else's pin, but I did see a few people walking around like challenging people openly and like just violently.

369
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:55,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean the top 25 players won prizes, let's talk about the prizes at PAX.

370
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:02,534
Speaker 0: Yes, they had much like most gaming cons a prize room with some enforcers sitting there and they had just you know All the prizes you can win.

371
00:25:02,554 --> 00:25:11,158
Speaker 1: Yep And this room was like behind a little window and like a coat check area and good god Did they have some sweet prizes back there?

372
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:13,156
Speaker 1: Sweet prizes.

373
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:17,680
Speaker 0: Yes I was not willing to try to win any of them partly because I did not have room in my luggage.

374
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:24,849
Speaker 1: The way to win the prizes was to do some sort of you know Win tournaments or DTS or any.

375
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,120
Speaker 1: there was ways to win prize all around but I didn't win any of them.

376
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:34,509
Speaker 1: But if I if I wasn't actually doing stuff at the con, you know And I wasn't interested in a lot of the events.

377
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,800
Speaker 1: Maybe I would have sat around and tried to win tournaments.

378
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,860
Speaker 1: I mean, I know I would have done the Puerto Rico tournament if I was if it wasn't during our panel.

379
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,667
Speaker 0: Oh my god the Puerto Rico tournament.

380
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:43,149
Speaker 1: Yeah.

381
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,760
Speaker 1: All right, two other things were in the bag of note.

382
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:51,032
Speaker 1: There was this VB Magazine, it's not and really I didn't look at it yet.

383
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:52,677
Speaker 1: It's not a really interesting magazine.

384
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:53,600
Speaker 0: through it had some articles.

385
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was interesting about it?

386
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:01,266
Speaker 1: It was basically they made a magazine for the San Diego Comic Con and PAX 2008 bags.

387
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:04,198
Speaker 1: this magazine was only available at those two places.

388
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:06,144
Speaker 1: brilliant I thought that was pretty interesting.

389
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:08,471
Speaker 1: and of course the con book.

390
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,056
Speaker 0: now the con book.

391
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:22,427
Speaker 0: I was taking it back You know, I'm used to Normal gaming cons which basically have a schedule full of an infinite number of small events or an anime con Which is you know, a million panels back-to-back all over the place.

392
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:32,500
Speaker 0: It's pretty much, you know us of relatively small number of Relatively high powered panels with like half-hour setup gaps between them.

393
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:35,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's here's what's in the con book for packs.

394
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:36,820
Speaker 1: Welcome the packs.

395
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,506
Speaker 1: Rules of packs.

396
00:26:38,707 --> 00:26:39,912
Speaker 0: the rules of packs are pretty good.

397
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,494
Speaker 0: You should read them.

398
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,120
Speaker 1: Yeah the X. Oh you want me to read them right now?

399
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,765
Speaker 0: I think we should.

400
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:48,020
Speaker 1: okay the seven rules of packs Except for the long speak which are not gonna read ready I don't want to get into it.

401
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:55,239
Speaker 0: But basically the rules of packs and the way they were followed and the way the con played out Says a lot about the kind of convention it was.

402
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,527
Speaker 0: now I'm gonna talk about that more in another show later.

403
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,033
Speaker 1: seven rules of packs ready.

Speaker 1: Don't mess with things that aren't yours.

410
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:15,834
Speaker 0: now I don't think I saw anyone cause a problem in the entirety of this convention.

411
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:16,677
Speaker 1: No, it was amazing.

Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

430
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, we still got nothing to do.

431
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,674
Speaker 0: There's hours before the con starts.

432
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:09,272
Speaker 0: So we notice a Cisco router Basically a link sis router powered by Cisco.

433
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:10,436
Speaker 1: I took a picture of it.

434
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:11,440
Speaker 1: You see it in my flicker.

435
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:13,520
Speaker 0: It is iconic of something.

436
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:14,222
Speaker 0: It was.

437
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:20,420
Speaker 0: it was sad and yet at the same time it reeked of that kind of duct tape ingenuity common to all geeks.

438
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Cisco.

439
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:28,320
Speaker 1: Well, you know Cisco at least sponsored a wireless network that they supposedly set up.

440
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,500
Speaker 0: Hey, there's no way they set it up because while they must have I mean they probably paid for it and provided the equipment.

441
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,460
Speaker 0: But in terms of wireless signal strength in area, they did not set it up well.

442
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,740
Speaker 0: That's that's one of my few complaints about the kind of wireless was mostly poop and it was actually really strong signal.

443
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:47,500
Speaker 0: But the signals overlapped and interfered with each other.

444
00:28:48,597 --> 00:29:00,699
Speaker 1: but I'm pretty sure this is a case of Cisco providing equipment and sponsorship and then Non-professional, I believe that Cisco set up that thing that Scott took a picture of.

445
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:03,930
Speaker 1: Not at all, it definitely looks like an enforcer job.

446
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,555
Speaker 1: not to insult the enforcer.

447
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:06,960
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz that was totally awesome.

448
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,380
Speaker 1: It's not an insult to the enforcers to say that they're not technology professional.

449
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,240
Speaker 0: Let me say this uber con had almost the exact same wireless setup.

450
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:19,218
Speaker 0: The only reason uber cons worked is that there was only one of them.

451
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:24,173
Speaker 0: but anyway aside from that we still had nothing to do.

452
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:29,660
Speaker 0: so we watered over to the Handheld gaming lounges aka the DS lounge.

453
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:36,520
Speaker 1: There's not much to do but you know and technically the DS lounges which there are three of didn't open until the con started.

454
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:39,812
Speaker 1: But the convention center was actually the big open area.

455
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:40,755
Speaker 1: It's not like Otacon.

456
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:42,020
Speaker 1: We are locked out of the building.

457
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,498
Speaker 1: It's this convention center had like restaurants in it and businesses and it's a place that you can go.

458
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:56,300
Speaker 0: point of note Ro told us and other people also independently told us that the pizza place in the convention center is terrible and not to eat there.

459
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:58,730
Speaker 1: We saw a lot of people eating there.

460
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,015
Speaker 0: Yes, none of them looked happy.

461
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:05,096
Speaker 0: He ate plenty of other places But there oh my god that burrito place that was like super cheap and pretty good.

462
00:30:05,116 --> 00:30:06,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was alright.

463
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:07,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a good smoothie there smoothie.

464
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,816
Speaker 0: I can actually finish which is rare Yeah, but you know what we decided.

465
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:12,420
Speaker 0: what are we gonna do?

466
00:30:12,721 --> 00:30:17,362
Speaker 0: We go up there and the way they did these DS lounges and I say DS cuz it was 90%.

467
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:19,268
Speaker 1: yes, I mean there was.

468
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:26,010
Speaker 1: the funniest part was you look at the schedule is oh my god They nominally had schedules for the DS lounges.

469
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,820
Speaker 1: I mean really they weren't super scheduled.

470
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:42,200
Speaker 1: I mean they didn't go around enforcing it, but it's basically like hey We'll put the schedule up and then maybe if someone really wants to play Mario Kart They'll show up at the Mario Kart time and their chances of getting a Mario Kart game going on will be better than otherwise.

471
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,714
Speaker 0: It was basically like 9 a.m.

472
00:30:44,754 --> 00:30:45,659
Speaker 0: To 10 a.m.

473
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:48,993
Speaker 0: Mario Kart DS Bomberman DS blah blah blah.

474
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:49,536
Speaker 0: 10 a.m.

475
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,774
Speaker 0: To 11 a.m Pie cross D like all the different DS games and then be like 1 to 1 30 PSP time.

476
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,311
Speaker 1: That that I don't know.

477
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:58,580
Speaker 1: that tells you about the PSP.

478
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,500
Speaker 1: I think it tells you that the multiplayer the local wireless multiplayer for the PSP is weak.

479
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:04,804
Speaker 0: The thing is though there were.

480
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:09,420
Speaker 0: I mean not to discard because the PSP is a despite all expectations.

481
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:21,980
Speaker 0: the PSP gets a lot of credit for being a valid and Successful second place and there are good games on it, and it's a great Single-player console, and it does have some pretty good multiplayer games.

482
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,520
Speaker 0: Just it doesn't have the pickup game appeal of the DS.

483
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:34,114
Speaker 0: I mean I saw people playing Bomberman every time I walked by that lounge for the entire con Yep, but the important thing is these sumo bags.

484
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,780
Speaker 0: I might have seen him, so we're not it.

485
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,899
Speaker 1: We're not a big fan of bean bags here.

486
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,029
Speaker 1: I mean they're not that comfortable and they they always.

487
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:44,262
Speaker 1: they make you look like you know a poor college dude 70s dude.

488
00:31:44,383 --> 00:31:46,490
Speaker 0: bean bags are one of those things like communism.

489
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,460
Speaker 0: that is awesome in theory not so great in implementation.

490
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,548
Speaker 1: They're usually real mushy, and you just sort of sink into them And you might as well be sitting on the floor.

491
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:58,383
Speaker 0: then they're kind of plastics you get all sweaty or their canvas Then they get stained.

492
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:01,654
Speaker 0: and bean bags are never the sign of a classy joint.

493
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:03,620
Speaker 1: That's why we only got banana chairs.

494
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,708
Speaker 1: You know they're much classier.

495
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:14,736
Speaker 1: I mean they're not perfect, but they're much better than bean bags, so Sumo Sponsored I guess packs by providing many many of their you know bean bags.

496
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:15,820
Speaker 0: Don't you say many many?

497
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,050
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand how many of them there were.

498
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,515
Speaker 0: they were everywhere.

499
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:23,733
Speaker 0: there were like a Hundred of them in the DS lounges.

500
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:31,680
Speaker 0: Oh by the way I say lounges because there were like three DSA B and C on three different floors connected by an escalator.

501
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,349
Speaker 1: well two of them were over on that's.

502
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:34,476
Speaker 1: B and C were over there.

503
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:39,680
Speaker 1: a Closer to the was on the floor with the console free plays and the rock band.

504
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,650
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I didn't really spend a lot of time over by a.

505
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,760
Speaker 1: so no it was mostly above a because people in a sucked.

506
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:52,340
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's right so that these sumos are basically a bean bag plus technology.

507
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:57,693
Speaker 1: It's a bean bag right and it's filled with these foam balls and the whole con.

508
00:32:58,054 --> 00:33:08,260
Speaker 1: only one of the bags opened up and spilled balls everywhere And it didn't smell too many of them And it's really packed pretty tightly not like a bean bag with lots of air.

509
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:09,189
Speaker 1: You know it's.

510
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:16,757
Speaker 1: it's packed pretty tight And it's got this really really good sort of plastic canvas II material that it's made of.

511
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:21,372
Speaker 1: it's not made of like you know What a bean bags made of which is basically the cheapest possible stuff.

512
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,118
Speaker 1: sewn together it is serious business.

513
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:27,217
Speaker 0: analogy I would use is like my air on chair where it's so it's a substance or off.

514
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:32,349
Speaker 0: the way It works is it's comfortable and yet it doesn't seem to stain and it doesn't like.

515
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:34,538
Speaker 0: it lets my sweat through and it was like a good substance.

516
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:46,939
Speaker 0: and Again, I don't think you understand how many of them were where there were I saw at one point an enforcer who had made A pyramid almost as tall as I was and was like asleep on top of it.

517
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:48,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're really.

518
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:52,480
Speaker 1: I mean if you think one of these is comfortable because one alone not by itself is real comfortable.

519
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:57,980
Speaker 1: I want to have a house Configuration right but getting multiple of them on top of each other.

520
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,347
Speaker 1: I didn't want to move.

521
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:12,527
Speaker 0: you could turn these things into like couches but basically when you went into these DS lounges you would see a Whole ton of people like cuddling or just laying next to each other and all these crazy Configurations like all over the place it was.

522
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:15,679
Speaker 0: it was quite a sight to behold I see even without the gaming.

523
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,543
Speaker 1: It was really great.

524
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,011
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of people were just chillin.

525
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:20,000
Speaker 0: They're kind of playing single-player DS games.

526
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:24,760
Speaker 0: They were doing the kind of the thing kids do where you put like two four-year-olds together.

527
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,152
Speaker 0: They don't play with each other, but they play separate things next to each other.

528
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:30,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of that going on.

529
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:32,289
Speaker 0: I spent a good amount of time kind of chillin.

530
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:33,995
Speaker 0: They're like recouping between things.

531
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:37,739
Speaker 0: on Saturday I fell asleep there for like 20 minutes by accident.

532
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:42,880
Speaker 1: But yeah, generally, you know We were treated there quite a few times and so did everyone else at the car.

533
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:53,809
Speaker 1: These things were pretty much always full except for the rare occasion when there would only be you know And things are really busy elsewhere at the car there my oh, yeah, and they had power strips Everywhere and two.

534
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:57,847
Speaker 0: you could borrow Rechargers for PSP's and DS's.

535
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:01,800
Speaker 1: yes, so for once it wasn't taboo to lose your battery.

536
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,525
Speaker 1: You know a run out of battery.

537
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:12,278
Speaker 0: they can charge you up and then a lot of people were using them the enforcers running it We're like, oh my god, the enforcers running these things were like so on top of their game.

538
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:18,858
Speaker 1: Yep So the one thing I learned is after the con I went to the sumo website to see what the deal with these things were.

539
00:35:18,878 --> 00:35:28,278
Speaker 0: pretty much I was thinking after laying on these Oh my god When we got a house we're gonna get like 10 of these and sip in the closet and every time the visigoths come out We're filling the basement with them.

540
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:32,900
Speaker 1: There are the cheapest one which the ones they had at PAX were the cheapest model.

541
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,077
Speaker 1: They have other models that are bigger and different but the cheap model is the one I want really.

542
00:35:37,117 --> 00:35:38,910
Speaker 1: the other ones are not Really what you want.

543
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:39,456
Speaker 0: they are.

544
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:41,884
Speaker 0: they try $150 each.

545
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:45,494
Speaker 1: there were thousands of dollars worth of sumos all over.

546
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:48,457
Speaker 1: if they if I would have known they were so expensive I would have stolen them.

547
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:52,432
Speaker 0: $150 a beanbag is like 40 bucks.

548
00:35:52,813 --> 00:35:56,227
Speaker 1: I guess that's why the price is Related to the quality.

549
00:35:56,327 --> 00:36:00,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, as much as I want what I don't think I'm gonna buy one I might cuz they're.

550
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:04,220
Speaker 1: the thing is the banana chairs aren't really doing it for me anymore living room.

551
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:09,540
Speaker 0: And the problem is like having wanted be nice But the dream would be to have a whole bunch of them for when people come over.

552
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, having a whole bunch would definitely be way more awesome than having just like a couple.

553
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:18,001
Speaker 0: but then again, you know I thought I was looking for furniture and a nice couch is like $1,200.

554
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,848
Speaker 0: that's true.

555
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,494
Speaker 0: divide that by sumos.

556
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:26,671
Speaker 0: It's not that bad for a geek Of course that of course you'd want a couch and the sumos.

557
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's rough couch upstairs sumos in the basement.

558
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:35,875
Speaker 0: I guess that could work kind of like a mullet, you know house upstairs stigmata of geekery in the basement.

559
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:38,922
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

560
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,206
Speaker 0: All right, we get our before we.

561
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:44,862
Speaker 0: I got to talk about this because again the con has not started yet Right.

562
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:48,460
Speaker 1: So the con has this main events room, which is the biggest room.

563
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,696
Speaker 1: It's where the concerts are and all the major events are and next to it is the lineup room.

564
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:58,420
Speaker 1: the lineup room Allows you as entrances both into the main events room and also to the exhibition hall.

565
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,385
Speaker 1: It's in between both.

566
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,620
Speaker 1: so they use it for a lineup to me every main event.

567
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,115
Speaker 1: They also use it for lineup to the expo room in the mornings when it opens up.

568
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:13,174
Speaker 0: So, all right We're not gonna you know Wait in line for anything and there's a lot of people in that room and there.

569
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:14,720
Speaker 0: the line culture at PAX was great.

570
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:19,360
Speaker 0: People were like bopping beach balls and balloons around and playing DS games and yelling and screaming.

571
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, in addition to that there was the cookie brigade at every line, which I'm sure you've heard about by now.

572
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,727
Speaker 1: But basically people baked cookies.

573
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:27,670
Speaker 1: they brought them the packs.

574
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,820
Speaker 1: They sold them to people in line mostly but also out of line.

575
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,549
Speaker 0: They sold like five thousand dollars worth of cookies.

576
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:34,953
Speaker 1: It was a dollar for a cookie.

577
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:36,980
Speaker 1: They sold five thousand dollars of the cookies.

578
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,743
Speaker 1: That means someone.

579
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:40,473
Speaker 1: they baked together at least five thousand cookies.

580
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:49,360
Speaker 0: I bought four of those cookies I bought one I bought four at once I ate them all in less time than it took to buy them and then all the money went to the child's play.

581
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,749
Speaker 0: I can't complain about that.

582
00:37:50,911 --> 00:38:05,560
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty crazy Yeah, so since it was a big line to get into the expo room right away the exhibition hall right away and made the big Events, you know the the keynote speech and the Q&A we gave in taiko, right?

583
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:06,528
Speaker 1: Wasn't?

584
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:13,658
Speaker 1: for a little while We started off our con going into the annex which we couldn't get into until 2. so 2 o'clock went to the annex.

585
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:20,267
Speaker 1: the annex Basically had the bottom floor of the annex was the Wizards of the coast floor We zads of the coast.

586
00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:26,220
Speaker 0: the second part on the bottom floor Basically the whip the watch the area you could do watch the crab.

587
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:27,673
Speaker 0: They had a spot where they could.

588
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:28,420
Speaker 0: they were tricking peep.

589
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:39,629
Speaker 0: They were trying to get people to sign up to be game testers for them And then they had a giant beholder and a bunch of standees with faces cut out of them So you could put your face behind it like at a carnival.

590
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are first pictures of rib.

591
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,413
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, there's pictures of me in a non.

592
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:48,911
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, check out my flicker you can see all.

593
00:38:49,032 --> 00:38:50,660
Speaker 0: yeah go to Scott's flicker this stuff there.

594
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:53,300
Speaker 1: No, I didn't take that many pictures, but I took pictures of that.

595
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:57,578
Speaker 0: We picked into the whiz ads all of the coast area and it was just whiz ads of the coast.

596
00:38:57,859 --> 00:38:59,486
Speaker 0: Yep There was a card economy.

597
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:08,080
Speaker 1: There's a tabletop floor, which we had, you know So many tables in such a great configuration and then they had you know a place you could check out board games.

598
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:12,960
Speaker 1: They had a great selection, but the selection was not as good as say the kinetic on selection.

599
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, now we there was a third floor that for whatever reason at this point.

600
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:17,600
Speaker 0: We didn't actually go up there.

601
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:21,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, the third floor had the serpent theater the fourth panel room.

602
00:39:22,161 --> 00:39:29,380
Speaker 1: It also had the mystery space and another space with a lot more tables for more gaming in case the second floor filled up.

603
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,023
Speaker 0: But we didn't.

604
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:31,290
Speaker 0: we didn't even look like.

605
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,175
Speaker 0: we didn't know it was out there.

606
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:33,000
Speaker 0: We didn't go up there.

607
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,559
Speaker 0: We just kind of got distracted by stuff.

608
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:36,427
Speaker 0: So we hung out in the tabletop area.

609
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:37,230
Speaker 1: and what did we?

610
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,040
Speaker 1: how do we kick off the packs the greatest game?

611
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,732
Speaker 1: We didn't even get off to the start of the connection.

612
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:45,407
Speaker 1: starting now people How did we kick off this amazing con?

613
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:49,459
Speaker 0: by playing pretty much one of the best board games ever made?

614
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:51,027
Speaker 1: Tiggers and Euphrates.

615
00:39:51,229 --> 00:40:04,040
Speaker 0: not only that but we played it with Ro You know awesome forumite who met us and Erin other awesome forumite who not only met us at the con It was totally cool and came from Canada, but brought us chocolate from Canada.

616
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:15,070
Speaker 0: I think she worked at the chocolate factory thus a Confluence of events that provided chocolate in my stomach and Tiggers and Euphrates in my hands And it was a pretty damn good game of Tiggers and Euphrates.

617
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,060
Speaker 0: I won by like a million points.

618
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:24,438
Speaker 1: Anyway at that moment at that game of T&E we realized there was a Puerto Rico tournament that conflicted with our panel.

619
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:26,786
Speaker 0: could go a Puerto Rico tournament.

620
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:28,312
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

621
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:28,954
Speaker 0: Could we have won?

622
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,360
Speaker 0: Well, could I have won that?

623
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,720
Speaker 1: There's a Carcassonne tournament that conflicted with the keynote and Q&A panel.

624
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:34,821
Speaker 1: I

625
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:51,740
Speaker 0: should be fair because Scott and I probably had Completely equal chances of winning the Puerto Rico tournament and we probably would have spoiled to try to make one of us or the other win, I Think I could have won that Carcassonne tournament Handily, and I think if I had not been in it Scott could have handily won that Carcassonne tournament.

626
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:53,729
Speaker 1: But we didn't do those things.

627
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:54,895
Speaker 1: They conflicted with other things.

628
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:55,759
Speaker 1: I would have liked to though.

629
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:06,339
Speaker 1: Instead after our game of T&E we went to the keynote and then immediately following the keynote was the Gabe and Tycho Or Jerry and Mike Q&A panel number one.

630
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:12,437
Speaker 1: so Not as in they had a second Q&A panel on Saturday, which we didn't go to now.

631
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:15,760
Speaker 0: at this point We've resigned ourselves to doing the main events.

632
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:32,320
Speaker 0: I mean the big things at this con were the keynote which is basically the opening ceremonies and then The Q&A and our plan was alright, let's see the keynote because Ken LaVon if you don't know He's the guy, you know, he was the guy behind like System Shock 2 and Bioshock

633
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:35,241
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty important gaming guy Yeah,

634
00:41:35,462 --> 00:41:36,726
Speaker 0: and he has a pretty cool story.

635
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:41,660
Speaker 0: and also how many cons out there have keynotes let alone industry awesome keynotes.

636
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:50,380
Speaker 1: I definitely think you know other conventions, you know, they Even if they have keynotes, that's usually a more businessy convention as a keynote, you know.

637
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,060
Speaker 1: And a lot of other cons they have like boring opening ceremonies.

638
00:41:53,201 --> 00:42:03,900
Speaker 1: I think I just everyone should do a keynote for the opening ceremonies with an important related in person And I just think that's the way to go because it gets people to come against people to care gets people excited.

639
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,300
Speaker 1: It gets people inspired and ready in the right frame of mind for the rest of the event.

640
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:11,692
Speaker 1: Doing the lame opening ceremonies like every other convention does.

641
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:16,349
Speaker 0: it's kind of Blair and I got to say mr Levine did a really damn good keynote.

642
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:16,810
Speaker 0: Basically.

643
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:19,440
Speaker 0: It was in the sort of TED talk style.

644
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:37,259
Speaker 0: you know those TED talks are pretty much the small number of Very like relevant very insightful like super good slides But they're kind of the backdrop to the awesome narrative that weaves them all together the kind of talk talk talk talk talk talk talk slide and the crowd goes.

645
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:42,473
Speaker 0: ah Or he whatever slide comes out, you know, he talked about.

646
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:55,652
Speaker 0: he gives this really good life story about you know being a nerd being like this super nerdy Jewish kid when no one else around him was nerdy as a kid and being awkward and Getting into gaming and getting into D&D and getting into comic books.

647
00:42:55,712 --> 00:43:01,540
Speaker 0: and he talked a lot about Logan's run And actually the whole date he did about Logan's run was really really good.

648
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:05,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only thing is you could tell this guy is a writer, right?

649
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,403
Speaker 1: He's talking about.

650
00:43:06,423 --> 00:43:11,320
Speaker 1: he was a Hollywood screenwriter and stuff and his presentation was super well-written.

651
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:19,180
Speaker 1: But his public speaking skills were not the most amazing But his writing carried him through and he didn't have a lot of good things to say.

652
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,680
Speaker 0: I don't know if I just say that I mean if we're talking to your public speaking skills.

653
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,749
Speaker 0: He pulled it off 90%.

654
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:25,753
Speaker 0: He did a really good talk.

655
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:27,460
Speaker 0: It was just I think what it was.

656
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,519
Speaker 0: I think he was a little nervous.

657
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:31,440
Speaker 0: It could be especially, you know his whole life story.

658
00:43:32,262 --> 00:43:34,880
Speaker 1: The thing is he was obviously reading it all off a piece of paper.

659
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what most people do but you know a lot of it.

660
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:39,954
Speaker 0: He had a lot of asides and yeah, it was.

661
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:43,473
Speaker 0: it was a really good talk And I wouldn't really say that it was poorly presented.

662
00:43:43,513 --> 00:43:44,760
Speaker 0: I think it was excellently presented.

663
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:52,958
Speaker 0: I think he was just a little bit nervous because the crowd that was watching him was frighteningly large.

664
00:43:53,703 --> 00:43:57,720
Speaker 1: It's pretty much because it is the biggest room at the con and it was spelled to capacity.

665
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:04,830
Speaker 0: So I'll say this if nothing else if you ever go to a PAX, but you should be going to a PAX Oh my god Go to the keynote.

666
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:08,260
Speaker 1: Oh my god Go you did not go to the keynote every single time.

667
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:17,600
Speaker 0: Well, the funny thing is he brought up Logan's run and then he brought up the old comic book Logan's run I didn't know existed and he talked a lot about like how the internet changed everything.

668
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,807
Speaker 1: I remember the New York Comic Con.

669
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:20,577
Speaker 1: you can go bin diving for the Logan's run gun.

670
00:44:20,677 --> 00:44:23,418
Speaker 0: Oh my god I kind of want to own it and then get him to sign it.

671
00:44:24,182 --> 00:44:29,440
Speaker 0: But anyway Logan's run kind of became a running theme because it came up a couple more times this weekend.

672
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:31,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was kind of weird.

673
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:45,174
Speaker 0: But uh, you know that ended and we were like, alright, let's stick around for whatever this Q&A is we'll probably walk out early because you know, I I expected this Q&A with the penny arcade Persons to be like any other convention Q&A totally lay.

674
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:46,820
Speaker 1: So first of all, you got to realize right?

675
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,620
Speaker 1: They didn't have another lineup for this.

676
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:59,340
Speaker 1: It was that lineup for the keynote in the line room was for the keynote directly followed by the Q&A Directly followed by the roosterteeth panel, which are the red versus blue guys.

677
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:01,513
Speaker 1: A lot of people didn't stay for that including us.

678
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:02,680
Speaker 1: We didn't need to see them.

679
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, like half the crowd walked out that they're no good.

680
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:05,492
Speaker 1: It's just.

681
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:07,220
Speaker 1: I really wasn't interested in seeing their panel.

682
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,885
Speaker 1: So I walked out.

683
00:45:07,945 --> 00:45:09,133
Speaker 0: well what someone said?

684
00:45:09,193 --> 00:45:13,228
Speaker 0: that I felt bad But at the same time it felt sound like it was kind of justified.

685
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,638
Speaker 0: I overheard the words Oh red verse blue.

686
00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:21,244
Speaker 0: That's so O'Byrne Total burn.

687
00:45:21,745 --> 00:45:25,857
Speaker 0: I felt kind of bad hearing that though because someday someone's gonna be like geek nights.

688
00:45:26,118 --> 00:45:26,620
Speaker 0: That's so.

689
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:35,087
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the Q&A now This was basically the keynote.

690
00:45:35,508 --> 00:45:37,233
Speaker 0: the Q&A was not just a Q&A.

691
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,239
Speaker 0: It was the opening ceremonies.

692
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:47,840
Speaker 0: now The house lights go down the stage lights go down The super professional like a light show at the front begins.

693
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:52,600
Speaker 0: It was as if a rock star is about to appear not just a small-time rock star.

694
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,189
Speaker 0: I'm talking like a big rock star like the biggest rock star.

695
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:58,195
Speaker 0: the music starts playing.

696
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:00,160
Speaker 1: Remember, this is the concert stage.

697
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:06,948
Speaker 1: they had this full concert stage set up with everything and They use that for every main event.

698
00:46:06,988 --> 00:46:08,976
Speaker 1: If you've got it might as well use it.

699
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,040
Speaker 1: Why would you hold it back?

700
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:12,793
Speaker 0: You know, the lights are going crazy.

701
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:23,686
Speaker 0: the smoke machine starts the music is building up to a crescendo and then two spotlights from crosswise come down on the two sides and Gabe and Tycho of penny arcade walk.

702
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:25,050
Speaker 1: Oh, you've got it wrong.

703
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:25,832
Speaker 1: You've got it.

704
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:26,514
Speaker 1: Totally wrong.

705
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:26,935
Speaker 0: Do I?

706
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:31,108
Speaker 1: Yes the curtain opens Revealing an orchestra.

707
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:32,432
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

708
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,700
Speaker 0: You see this was so classy.

709
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:38,434
Speaker 0: This was classy and epic times a thousand.

710
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:41,385
Speaker 0: a freaking orchestra Starts playing.

711
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:53,420
Speaker 1: it wasn't a full orchestra like, you know, bros and rosa people, but it was you know No, they had a small section You know, there was some violins some flutes and some little horns and some you know, timpani actions.

712
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,548
Speaker 1: It was a conductor the whole thing.

713
00:46:56,311 --> 00:47:06,234
Speaker 0: and to all this they walk out Tycho adorned in a cape and It is one of the few times in my life outside of a Renaissance Festival.

714
00:47:06,335 --> 00:47:13,529
Speaker 0: I've seen someone wear a cape Non-ironically and pull it the fuck off And that was a scary cave - that wasn't like.

715
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,172
Speaker 1: that was like.

716
00:47:14,192 --> 00:47:16,440
Speaker 1: that wasn't like one of those capes a larper wears.

717
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:24,004
Speaker 1: It was a nerd cape like a really nerdy game red on the inside with circular flappy things and man Is it nerd?

718
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,460
Speaker 0: I need to point out dude pulled it off.

719
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:30,717
Speaker 1: It was like it was a basically the in the world of capes if capes for hats.

720
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:32,625
Speaker 1: It was a beanie I don't know.

721
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:43,500
Speaker 0: I think I would call it the topest of top hat Because the way he carried it and the way it I don't think anyone could ever pull off wearing that cape but him.

722
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:46,100
Speaker 1: You definitely need a bald head to wear that cape.

723
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:49,685
Speaker 0: so They come out.

724
00:47:49,746 --> 00:48:01,156
Speaker 0: and this is when if anyone you know didn't realize That that these two gentlemen are basically video game rock stars Even though they seem to not want to be or not admit they are but they are.

725
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:04,425
Speaker 1: they're rock stars At least at their own convention.

726
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:07,633
Speaker 0: the spectacle and the crowd was amazing.

727
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:10,460
Speaker 0: and then they start talking and it's amazing.

728
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:12,747
Speaker 0: And then they get right into the Q&A.

729
00:48:13,168 --> 00:48:15,174
Speaker 0: they basically had a stud and up.

730
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:21,388
Speaker 0: this says something about packs Basically into the two main aisles and quite a bit back.

731
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:26,379
Speaker 0: They had two unattended and unguarded microphones.

732
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:28,554
Speaker 1: Danger will Robinson danger.

733
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:35,080
Speaker 0: Oh my god It would at any other con would that have spelled baba booey baba booey Howard Stern's penis disaster, right?

734
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,360
Speaker 1: I mean someone just gets up there says a bunch of stupid shit.

735
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:41,000
Speaker 1: You need an enforcer to run all the way over to the microphone to stop them.

736
00:48:41,562 --> 00:48:58,171
Speaker 0: You know, I mean if I was running a con I would have enforcers at the microphone with like a taser Exactly, but no they basically say alright if you have questions, there are microphones and people line up and No One really asked a stupid question.

737
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,520
Speaker 0: It was kind of scary.

738
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:07,354
Speaker 1: I mean there were some people who were saying things that were a little you know Yeah, we're a little lab but most of it was you know, people ask, you know, what asked?

739
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:14,560
Speaker 0: stupid crap, you know, like dude You know and no one was like scary like some anime cons.

740
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,005
Speaker 0: You're up there some gaming cons.

741
00:49:16,026 --> 00:49:22,280
Speaker 0: if there's a Q&A like this and there's the dude who asked like the really scary Question everyone the crowd is like really uncomfortable.

742
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:23,745
Speaker 0: That didn't happen.

743
00:49:24,668 --> 00:49:31,000
Speaker 0: one girl was dressed up as a tentacle monster and she just walked up there and went rawr Yeah, I think she walked away.

744
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,309
Speaker 1: I think she's is really nervous and couldn't say anything.

745
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,240
Speaker 1: but or she was doing a performance piece as they suggested.

746
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,774
Speaker 0: But the thing is it wasn't just like.

747
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,740
Speaker 0: question then answer.

748
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:46,820
Speaker 0: It was like back and forth between them on stage and whoever was at the microphone and they alternated back and forth between the module.

749
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, you know Gabe covered the left side lane and Tycho covered the right side lanes Yeah, and they kind of go back and forth.

750
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:57,845
Speaker 0: It was kind of like a gong show or periodic like and Back to the right side.

751
00:49:57,865 --> 00:50:07,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly the correct side, you know people said stuff like, you know I came on the cross-country super trip blah blah blah or Son child's play blah.

752
00:50:07,188 --> 00:50:10,440
Speaker 1: or you know, where are the special edition hardcover books?

753
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,327
Speaker 1: Why are we only getting the soft covers now?

754
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:15,220
Speaker 1: now a lot of legitimate, you know stuff that you know.

755
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,602
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

756
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:18,778
Speaker 1: some of it was really funny, but most of it was just kind of you know

757
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:29,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, and one guy like this and he starts talking starts to ask a question and he asked kind of along the lines of you Guys really didn't expect this you didn't get this it was like what.

758
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:35,650
Speaker 0: then he whips out a little little little little speaker box And he Rick rolls the audience.

759
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:39,250
Speaker 1: That was that was the first Rick roll they could mention.

760
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,540
Speaker 1: it was also the lamest but he was alright.

761
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:44,330
Speaker 0: It was alright because it was.

762
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:52,424
Speaker 1: it was done pretty well And usually if someone doesn't do a Rick roll just right you groan, but it was kind of like All right, man.

763
00:50:52,464 --> 00:50:54,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love how taiko is basically like that.

764
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:56,335
Speaker 0: Did we just get Rick rolled?

765
00:50:56,355 --> 00:50:58,140
Speaker 0: I think he's Rick rolling us.

766
00:50:59,062 --> 00:51:00,311
Speaker 0: You're totally Rick rolling us.

767
00:51:00,412 --> 00:51:01,540
Speaker 0: Are you I mean wilds?

768
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:08,360
Speaker 1: And is really teeny coming out of a little tape player into a microphone.

769
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:14,600
Speaker 0: I think what gave it the most class was that he knew the proper time to turn the Rick roll off and give up his moment.

770
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:18,100
Speaker 1: Yes, it was perfect timing with the turn-off that saved it.

771
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:27,559
Speaker 0: Yes Pretty much everyone out there like they knew when like the steam of their conversation with the queue with the people up front Timed out and when they just kind of walked away and it worked really well.

772
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,229
Speaker 0: So, of course we're sitting there and we're like now.

773
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:31,613
Speaker 0: actually this was this.

774
00:51:31,694 --> 00:51:33,560
Speaker 0: we came up with this like a while before.

775
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:46,160
Speaker 1: We didn't we didn't have anything to ask really right but as you're at the convention, you know We looked at our badges and they said special guest and what presenter or a panelist special guest and panelist bad?

776
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:52,259
Speaker 0: Our badge was light blue and it was it said on it specifically in square brackets sky blue.

777
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:54,726
Speaker 0: now I noticed it said sky blue.

778
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:56,973
Speaker 0: Why would it say sky blue?

779
00:51:57,033 --> 00:52:05,113
Speaker 0: and then you know, we noticed that the normal attendee badge was red red being the second lowest color in Paranoia.

780
00:52:05,213 --> 00:52:07,385
Speaker 1: and if you don't know paranoia, I'm not gonna explain it to you.

781
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:07,988
Speaker 0: and then we see.

782
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:13,710
Speaker 0: you know The media badge is yellow and some other badges blue and we see all these different badges.

783
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:19,370
Speaker 1: I just want to point out at this time that the musical guests also had sky blue badges because they were special guest.

784
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:24,450
Speaker 0: Yes, so we had the same badge as MC front a lot, which was totally my head like popped when I saw that.

785
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:24,831
Speaker 0: Yeah,

786
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:44,157
Speaker 1: anyway, I noticed when we were sitting in the audience right because they have basically in this main events room Cameras lots of them because they make the packs DVD and they record everything right and They were you know They the cameras are aimed at gave in taiko and you can see them really big on the two giant projection screens

787
00:52:44,257 --> 00:52:49,078
Speaker 0: and Scott looks up and he says I Think they have ultraviolet badges.

788
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,310
Speaker 1: the badges said, you know all access.

789
00:52:52,451 --> 00:52:53,896
Speaker 1: I saw it for like a second said all.

790
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:57,790
Speaker 1: tycos badge said all access and it was purple clearly purple.

791
00:52:58,272 --> 00:53:01,705
Speaker 0: Right now at this point there's no way it's a coincidence.

792
00:53:01,926 --> 00:53:02,749
Speaker 0: So we're like, oh my god.

793
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:07,530
Speaker 0: Oh my god Oh my god, so Scott's like I'm gonna go up and ask and I was like, I'm going to let's go up there.

794
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:09,770
Speaker 1: So he plans it in advance.

795
00:53:10,471 --> 00:53:15,632
Speaker 0: Now, of course as we do we walk up there and we're in line for a while and the guy this dude behind us is Like.

796
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,981
Speaker 0: it's a little bit annoying nice.

797
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:19,919
Speaker 0: Like I don't know if my questions good I don't know if they make funny me and I'm like.

798
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:20,965
Speaker 0: so so what are you gonna say?

799
00:53:21,025 --> 00:53:31,325
Speaker 0: He's like well uh, I kind of quit my job because they wouldn't give me time off to come to the con and I kind of don't have a hotel room and I came out here like the last minute.

800
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:33,677
Speaker 0: I don't even have money And it was like.

801
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:34,743
Speaker 1: good luck with that.

802
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:35,729
Speaker 0: I'm done with that.

803
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:42,147
Speaker 0: But so we get up there and we basically we're like, I'm like look my badge is sky blue.

804
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:45,197
Speaker 1: and they're like, yep I'm like Regular tendy.

805
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,083
Speaker 1: what color is your badge?

806
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:46,708
Speaker 1: red red?

807
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,160
Speaker 1: Tyco, what's your badge up there?

808
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,690
Speaker 1: Is that is that ultraviolet?

809
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:51,854
Speaker 0: yeah, are you happy?

810
00:53:51,894 --> 00:53:54,107
Speaker 0: said, you know the and we're kind of going back and forth with them.

811
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:58,446
Speaker 0: and Finally and at one point they're like this is kind of like a little show.

812
00:53:58,466 --> 00:54:03,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we get up there I'm like, you know, I'm Scott We're you guys we're from New York.

813
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:07,704
Speaker 1: No today and games like oh, it's like a little show like you thought we were so quaint.

814
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:17,104
Speaker 0: and then And then basically we get our paranoia question out and he's like, wait a minute You're making a paranoid cuz we didn't say paranoia.

815
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:18,672
Speaker 0: and he's like, wait a minute We're just like.

816
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,362
Speaker 1: we're just like does the computer know about this you communist?

817
00:54:21,663 --> 00:54:23,350
Speaker 0: and he's like are you making a paranoia agent?

818
00:54:23,553 --> 00:54:24,448
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I love you.

819
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:26,596
Speaker 0: He said it just like that.

820
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:29,249
Speaker 0: And then we said I said I want to play paranoia with you.

821
00:54:29,571 --> 00:54:32,110
Speaker 1: And then we took the opportunity to pimp our panel.

822
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:39,306
Speaker 0: Yes And we totally got away with it because we we built up enough to where our time in the Sun our time in front of That microphone was not out yet.

823
00:54:40,271 --> 00:54:44,424
Speaker 1: So we pimped our panel Sun burning wheel and he's like all burning wheels the shit.

824
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,090
Speaker 0: I totally want to play with you.

825
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:47,238
Speaker 0: I'm coming to your panel now.

826
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:49,050
Speaker 0: I knew he wasn't gonna come to the panel.

827
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:50,474
Speaker 0: Billion things like.

828
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:55,930
Speaker 0: they held up the spreadsheet that Robert coup put together and gave them telling them where to be when.

829
00:54:56,672 --> 00:55:01,687
Speaker 0: So I I was pretty sure that beyond Dungeons and Dragons was not on his where to be when she.

830
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,810
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

831
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:05,569
Speaker 0: Either it was a really complicated sheet, too.

832
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:09,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was pretty much a harsh harsh itinerary.

833
00:55:09,731 --> 00:55:16,281
Speaker 0: Yes, so we had a little moment and we sat back down and all the other questions were awesome And it was a really awesome panel.

834
00:55:16,844 --> 00:55:17,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally awesome.

835
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:29,958
Speaker 0: actually, one thing that was kind of funny was that a lot of people seem to have brought gifts for Gabe and Tycho like offerings and There's the one person who brought like a whole bunch of Candy from Canada that was unavailable to them.

836
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:37,421
Speaker 1: and then someone else came up and like my wife is like nine months pregnant She saw that candy go by and Tycho was like here.

837
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:38,786
Speaker 1: We know we know all about that here.

838
00:55:38,826 --> 00:55:39,569
Speaker 1: take like three of them.

839
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:42,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, those two were really funny up on stage.

840
00:55:42,957 --> 00:55:46,930
Speaker 1: Like they're their dynamic dualness is they sound just like they do in their podcast.

841
00:55:47,010 --> 00:56:06,970
Speaker 1: They're actually were a large number of requests for them to sort of revive their podcast a bit because it's been lacking and It gives me some sort of hope that like this actually is like this demand for podcasts in a way that we just sort of I don't know got it like something can be done as opposed to podcasts are going to be the way they are forever.

842
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:12,331
Speaker 0: It was just funny though that like everyone who had a gift they say well bring it up to our altar and they'd like walk Up.

843
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:13,682
Speaker 0: and I remember one guy in particular.

844
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:19,070
Speaker 0: he walks up with his gift He has and he's like so nervous that he's shaking and he like walks over.

845
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:23,370
Speaker 1: He's like he's like his hand is shaking as he hands him like this envelope and he like puts it down.

846
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:31,526
Speaker 0: Then he scurries away as like a rat as fast as possible like they're going to bite him, which they are They probably would have if he'd gotten any closer.

847
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:38,524
Speaker 1: They like to bite Anyway Anyway, so yeah, one thing about this con is.

848
00:56:38,544 --> 00:56:39,850
Speaker 1: I looked at the schedule, right?

849
00:56:40,111 --> 00:56:45,132
Speaker 1: And when I look at the schedule I see like this I see stuff like on Saturday.

850
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:48,205
Speaker 1: there's the you know, make a strip panel, which we missed.

851
00:56:48,627 --> 00:56:49,430
Speaker 1: we'll talk about that later.

852
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:54,090
Speaker 1: But as a line the lineup for it is longer than the panel itself.

853
00:56:54,471 --> 00:57:00,613
Speaker 1: The concerts have a huge lineup the all the main events of these huge lineups and all the main events of the stuff I want to do.

854
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:11,769
Speaker 1: so I look at the schedule and I'm thinking man between eating and Going to these events and waiting in line and finding some time to go to the expo room at some point the exhibition room.

855
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:16,150
Speaker 1: I'm I'm not gonna do anything but wait in line and go to these events.

856
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:22,724
Speaker 1: It's got the whole con and I was sort of disappointed at that But I still felt like it was worth it because those events were so awesome.

857
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:29,753
Speaker 1: in reality I did a lot of stuff besides wait in line to go to these events because you didn't really have to wait in line the Whole time.

858
00:57:29,894 --> 00:57:33,483
Speaker 0: now, I mean other than it on the last day We didn't really wait in any lines.

859
00:57:33,503 --> 00:57:35,390
Speaker 0: like all the concerts We kind of walk.

860
00:57:35,491 --> 00:57:40,610
Speaker 0: I mean there was a line to get in to get good spots But we just kind of walked in after everyone else was in no problem.

861
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:44,487
Speaker 1: And because the way they do a thing with the wristbands, you know.

862
00:57:44,507 --> 00:57:48,349
Speaker 1: for the concerts Basically, if you get there really early in the morning get a wristband right away.

863
00:57:48,751 --> 00:58:02,164
Speaker 1: But when the concert starts you can just go get a wristband, you know Because they there's a lot more than they ones they give out right crowd psychology little hint all you geek nights listeners We actually were right up near the front and every one of these events.

864
00:58:02,184 --> 00:58:06,770
Speaker 0: and the way we did it was you walk into the Room, it's super crowded on the side by the entrance.

865
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:24,869
Speaker 0: if you walk around the back all the way to the other side and then all the way around like almost behind the stage and Then walk like back toward the center There's a big kind of gap there because just like crowd psychology everyone kind of crowds around by the entrance And if you get around those people you can get real close real quick

866
00:58:25,656 --> 00:58:25,837
Speaker 1: Yep.

867
00:58:25,938 --> 00:58:36,310
Speaker 0: Anyway, so After the Q&A panel, all right, we go to the annex again and now like we're ready like, all right We got nothing to do until the concerts tonight.

868
00:58:36,772 --> 00:58:41,390
Speaker 1: Let's totally play some game before dinner because then we're gonna eat dinner go to the concert.

869
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:50,742
Speaker 1: So we go to the get to say the checkout of board games room and we're looking and we're thinking maybe we'll play Agricola now to be known as Agricola.

870
00:58:50,943 --> 00:58:55,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I gotta point out though They had a lot of good games in there But they had the Dune game the game.

871
00:58:55,981 --> 00:58:56,806
Speaker 0: we have the game.

872
00:58:56,826 --> 00:58:57,630
Speaker 0: that's so awesome.

873
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:58,756
Speaker 0: It was special.

874
00:58:58,796 --> 00:59:01,590
Speaker 0: you had to check it out special and you couldn't leave the room with it.

875
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're thinking maybe a Agricola.

876
00:59:04,778 --> 00:59:09,530
Speaker 1: because you know, that's the hot new game in the German games world.

877
00:59:09,972 --> 00:59:13,090
Speaker 1: But then I see via Poletti and via Poletti is a game.

878
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,788
Speaker 1: it was a spiel de jar winner a while ago o2 or o3 or something like that.

879
00:59:16,808 --> 00:59:20,088
Speaker 1: and It's sort of like a fancy Jenga.

880
00:59:20,451 --> 00:59:24,510
Speaker 1: Right you build a little tower and you don't want to knock it over and you know stuff like that.

881
00:59:25,092 --> 00:59:25,975
Speaker 1: But I'd never played it.

882
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:28,405
Speaker 1: I'd only heard of it and was intrigued.

883
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:29,590
Speaker 1: So we got it.

884
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,097
Speaker 1: I said, you know what?

885
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:30,989
Speaker 1: Let's just fucking get it.

886
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,905
Speaker 1: I'm getting it because the thing about playing games at a convention, especially use.

887
00:59:34,966 --> 00:59:37,376
Speaker 1: you want to play a game You've never played before.

888
00:59:37,698 --> 00:59:41,596
Speaker 1: if you played it before you're wasting your time at a convention Especially if you own the game.

889
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:42,600
Speaker 1: you want to play games.

890
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,685
Speaker 1: you don't own games.

891
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:44,850
Speaker 1: You couldn't plan another occasion.

892
00:59:45,192 --> 00:59:47,768
Speaker 1: The problem is if you play games, you've never played before.

893
00:59:47,788 --> 00:59:52,825
Speaker 1: now You're losing precious convention time learning and learning how to play the game.

894
00:59:53,206 --> 00:59:56,924
Speaker 1: if I would have taken Agricola Right, which is even though I know that's the wrong pronunciation.

895
00:59:56,944 --> 00:59:57,508
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit.

896
00:59:58,372 --> 01:00:04,844
Speaker 1: We would have taken like an hour to learn the game read the rules and someone actually told us one of the enforcers manning the room there.

897
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:08,060
Speaker 1: However, the rules of Agricola were poorly written.

898
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:13,030
Speaker 0: We saw a lot a group of kids later on Playing power grid for the first time.

899
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,990
Speaker 1: Well, I harass them quite a bit and they didn't like you obviously.

900
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:22,510
Speaker 1: So I said via Paletti is a jangle light game, it's probably real easy to learn the rules.

901
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:23,554
Speaker 1: Let's get that.

902
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:24,337
Speaker 1: so we got it.

903
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:27,690
Speaker 0: You just stack things up on top of each other and then Scott knocks it.

904
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:29,017
Speaker 1: Oh, we're gonna do a whole show on it.

905
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:31,210
Speaker 1: All you have to know is that I've ordered the game.

906
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:33,459
Speaker 1: It's so good, but we played this game.

907
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:35,727
Speaker 1: We got two random packs people to play with us.

908
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:36,430
Speaker 1: They were awesome.

909
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,434
Speaker 0: Yeah and then we got like.

910
01:00:37,474 --> 01:00:42,095
Speaker 0: we played it a bunch of times and we got a couple other different people to play and Everyone in the room was kind of like.

911
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:46,470
Speaker 0: they kind of start watching like from the side like sidelong glances from their own games.

912
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:48,394
Speaker 1: basically we were playing this game.

913
01:00:48,434 --> 01:01:02,670
Speaker 1: it became like the centerpiece of the room as the tower got bigger and bigger and as there were two tiny sticks holding up this gigantic tower and then eventually crash and Yelling and screaming and everyone starts yelling in the room and one guy claps.

914
01:01:02,832 --> 01:01:11,840
Speaker 0: It was a. it was a good time But I got to talk a little bit about the room too because the game this is the best tabletop gaming space I have ever seen.

915
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:23,830
Speaker 0: it was basically a lot one large room that was Divided in the center by a low cubicle wall And all around it were tables and chairs like square big circular tables like six or seven chairs.

916
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:37,956
Speaker 0: It was also small square tables like lots of different configurations And then all around the perimeter were little hallways and in these little hallways were little rooms with like a table in six Chairs and a door you could close behind you.

917
01:01:38,397 --> 01:01:46,940
Speaker 1: So pretty much like any table configuration that you were looking for was available and You know for gaming it doesn't get better than that.

918
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,955
Speaker 1: you can have a private RPG room a big miniatures table Whatever you want.

919
01:01:52,217 --> 01:01:53,403
Speaker 1: They had it going on.

920
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:54,810
Speaker 1: It was totally freakin sweet.

921
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:59,290
Speaker 0: Yep Any other cool thing that they had set up that totally got to bring this to kinetic on?

922
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:02,053
Speaker 0: Was if you were looking for a game You just held.

923
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,679
Speaker 0: they had these signs for you ready.

924
01:02:03,959 --> 01:02:07,030
Speaker 0: that said LFG and on the bottom what kind of game you wanted to play.

925
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:11,110
Speaker 0: You just walked around holding it and eventually people would congregate and play a game.

926
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:19,210
Speaker 1: So if like you wanted to play settlers You just picked up a copy of settlers in an LFG sign and you just sort of walked around with it and people would say What's up settlers?

927
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:29,250
Speaker 0: Let's rock and roll or you'd see like five people who would all congregate cuz they all had like LFG board game and then they all walked in as strangers to the room together checked out a game as a group.

928
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:34,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you wanted to play a game and you saw someone holding up LFG you to go to them and say hey Let's play.

929
01:02:34,992 --> 01:02:44,705
Speaker 1: and at the same time it also helped because sometimes you had a gaming con you're playing a game People come up to you and say hey Can I play and you'll have to be like you'll feel bad because you'd like.

930
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:45,770
Speaker 1: now we've already got four.

931
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:46,595
Speaker 1: We already got five.

932
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,770
Speaker 1: So with the LFG signs.

933
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:52,223
Speaker 1: No one bothered you if you didn't have the sign because it.

934
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:53,388
Speaker 1: they assumed you weren't.

935
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:53,770
Speaker 1: LFG.

936
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:57,440
Speaker 0: And also the like all the people running this room.

937
01:02:57,761 --> 01:03:05,670
Speaker 0: pretty much they left everyone in the gaming area completely alone Except sometimes enforcers would come and like play a game and the people managing the game checkout.

938
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,798
Speaker 0: We're like the most awesome together.

939
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,670
Speaker 1: people like they all and they were super knowledgeable at games, too.

940
01:03:10,911 --> 01:03:14,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, we walk in and I was like, oh my god, we should play teeny.

941
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:14,573
Speaker 0: What was like?

942
01:03:14,593 --> 01:03:15,257
Speaker 0: that's a good game.

943
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:16,305
Speaker 0: Have you played Puerto Rico?

944
01:03:16,345 --> 01:03:16,768
Speaker 0: and I'm like.

945
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,757
Speaker 0: We took turns naming games.

946
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:21,801
Speaker 0: I was like have you played this?

947
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,286
Speaker 0: she's like duh, have you played this?

948
01:03:23,347 --> 01:03:23,628
Speaker 0: I'm like duh.

949
01:03:24,311 --> 01:03:25,642
Speaker 0: Eventually named every good game.

950
01:03:25,723 --> 01:03:31,170
Speaker 0: I was like, okay cool Yep, and you know we hang around there for a while and then eventually we go to eat.

951
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,170
Speaker 0: You know, we got to eat at some point at this count.

952
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:37,570
Speaker 0: All I want to say is I walk out I see that crepe line and I totally didn't eat there.

953
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,770
Speaker 1: We went to lounge B a little bit more and it was as around this time.

954
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:46,186
Speaker 1: Remember I said there were three DS lounges a B and C right or handheld lounges.

955
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:57,933
Speaker 1: Excuse me We hung out and B and then we hung out and B again and we sort of developed this allegiance to lounge B and unjustified Desired.

956
01:03:57,993 --> 01:03:59,056
Speaker 1: it's completely justified.

957
01:03:59,096 --> 01:04:01,022
Speaker 1: lounge a lounge C were shit and look out.

958
01:04:01,062 --> 01:04:01,744
Speaker 1: B was awesome.

959
01:04:01,865 --> 01:04:03,530
Speaker 0: lounge C tried too hard.

960
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:04,995
Speaker 0: Lounge a was shit.

961
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:08,710
Speaker 0: lounge B, especially sitting at the bottom of the lounge of Kings.

962
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:16,913
Speaker 0: I was sitting at the bottom of that escalator in my thing Like I felt like a king watching all my subjects filtered by even though Actually gave in.

963
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:22,574
Speaker 0: taiko were the Kings and we were just pretenders to the throne who were totally about to get punked by some army From the East.

964
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:23,158
Speaker 0: doesn't matter.

965
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,436
Speaker 1: Anybody isn't a large B sucks Technically army from the West.

966
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:30,450
Speaker 0: we were the usurper army from the East that failed to gather the support of the man.

967
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:32,359
Speaker 1: Anyone who isn't lounge B is awesome.

968
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:34,088
Speaker 0: All right, so what I think you mean?

969
01:04:34,128 --> 01:04:34,570
Speaker 0: the opposite.

970
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,119
Speaker 1: I said anyone who is in lounge B is awesome.

971
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,970
Speaker 0: I thought you said everyone who isn't lounge B is awesome.

972
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:42,130
Speaker 1: No, I said everyone not in lounge B is poop.

973
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:43,150
Speaker 0: I can't say though.

974
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:51,319
Speaker 0: I saw one guy in lounge B on Sunday when I was walking by with an original gameboy playing a game on sweet That was so excited.

975
01:04:51,379 --> 01:04:52,909
Speaker 1: You know lounge B is the best.

976
01:04:53,537 --> 01:04:59,419
Speaker 1: All right, anyway After much to do it was time for the Friday night concert.

Speaker 0: we walk in and The one-up start playing.

991
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,193
Speaker 1: Well, the one-ups had been playing for a little.

992
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,860
Speaker 0: we miss like half of one song.

993
01:06:02,242 --> 01:06:03,347
Speaker 0: Now the one-ups are really.

994
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:09,839
Speaker 0: they played kind of not smooth jazz But light jazz heavily influenced by video game.

995
01:06:11,163 --> 01:06:11,664
Speaker 0: They would

996
01:06:11,704 --> 01:06:16,576
Speaker 1: take the like the bass melody of a popular video game song or sometimes

997
01:06:16,617 --> 01:06:18,422
Speaker 0: the harmony and melodify Right,

998
01:06:18,543 --> 01:06:28,667
Speaker 1: and and then they would just jazz it up crazily like just play a jazz song where that was the seed and the song just grew out of it and It was pretty awesome.

999
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:32,869
Speaker 0: I would totally download their musics Yeah, but then you know, that was really exciting.

1000
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:37,406
Speaker 0: then they ended and of course we went through this charade of Encore encore.

1001
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:42,740
Speaker 0: Oh my god, then they came back and did more songs and then Freeze pop came out.

1002
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:48,416
Speaker 0: If you don't know freeze pop my boss at work knows freeze pop and still listens to them.

1003
01:06:48,456 --> 01:06:49,097
Speaker 0: freeze bug is.

1004
01:06:49,198 --> 01:06:50,845
Speaker 0: pop is well-known Among older people.

1005
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:52,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're in the guitar heroes.

1006
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:52,859
Speaker 1: They do that.

1007
01:06:58,741 --> 01:06:59,584
Speaker 1: That's freeze pop.

1008
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:00,948

Speaker 0: the last packs also science genius girl and all that business, right?

1011
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:11,477
Speaker 1: So we see them and I had heard from the last packs that they weren't the best live you know as well as they were recorded.

1012
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,720
Speaker 1: and Hey, I could see why you would say that but he doesn't fucking matter.

1013
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:21,751
Speaker 0: It was an amazing freaking concert and anyone who said everyone was rocking the house out Yeah, anyone who said it was a bad concert was wrong.

1014
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:22,213
Speaker 0: and it was.

1015
01:07:22,494 --> 01:07:23,760
Speaker 0: this concert was great.

1016
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:31,188
Speaker 1: Then dual key tars two key tars Two key tars like I mean it was.

1017
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:32,993
Speaker 1: this was how many key tars?

1018
01:07:33,194 --> 01:07:33,876
Speaker 1: more than one.

1019
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:36,395
Speaker 0: this is one of the better concerts I've been to in my life.

1020
01:07:36,578 --> 01:07:39,733
Speaker 0: Yeah Best concert but pretty good.

1021
01:07:39,753 --> 01:07:45,393
Speaker 0: and when I say this concert I mean freeze pop not the concert as a whole because you know freeze.

1022
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:51,470
Speaker 1: and then there's the one part right where the dude Cuz remember first it was jazz then it was basically synth pop, right?

1023
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:54,136
Speaker 1: Why one song right?

1024
01:07:54,156 --> 01:07:58,910
Speaker 1: the freeze pop dude put down his keytar and picked up a guitar and it was an electric guitar.

1025
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,714
Speaker 1: I mean he played it.

1026
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:07,948
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, yeah electric guitars are magic Cuz you sort of forget listening to the keytar how amazing the electric guitar is.

1027
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:09,990
Speaker 0: and you know Like they played a slightly slow song.

1028
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,181
Speaker 0: So like people are holding up the DS's and things.

1029
01:08:12,643 --> 01:08:21,591
Speaker 0: and then freeze pop is like no no no, all you do that house lights down and That was a fucking sight Cuz.

1030
01:08:21,671 --> 01:08:25,710
Speaker 0: I mean I mean dude was holding up his like 22 inch laptop.

1031
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:30,270
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, we everyone's been doing the hold up electronic device thing.

1032
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:34,505
Speaker 1: You know ever since smoking became uncool and cell phones became cool, right?

1033
01:08:34,786 --> 01:08:35,950
Speaker 1: This is not something new.

1034
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,856
Speaker 1: It's been around for a long time.

1035
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:41,930
Speaker 1: the hold up your device for light at a concert right instead of a lighter.

1036
01:08:42,573 --> 01:08:45,830
Speaker 1: But you know you they took it a step further.

1037
01:08:46,051 --> 01:08:54,424
Speaker 1: You know, they said turn off all the lights only light from electronic devices, you know I downloaded one of those free flashlight apps for my iPhone.

1038
01:08:54,725 --> 01:08:58,490
Speaker 0: then in there in the room I was holding up my razor and my blackberry.

1039
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:03,270
Speaker 0: I kept hitting the button on the side to make the light stay on so it was doubly cool.

1040
01:09:03,392 --> 01:09:04,689
Speaker 1: I don't think that'd be cool again.

1041
01:09:05,051 --> 01:09:10,037
Speaker 1: You know, he's just more of the same but one guy had the best I don't know to see it pushed to the limit.

1042
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:13,710
Speaker 0: It was literally a animated picture of a lit lighter.

1043
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:15,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have those.

1044
01:09:15,337 --> 01:09:16,464
Speaker 1: you can get that for the iPhone.

1045
01:09:16,504 --> 01:09:17,550
Speaker 1: that it's yeah a pic.

1046
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:22,529
Speaker 1: It's just like an animation of a flame on your on your iPhone, but freeze pop was really good.

1047
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:26,470
Speaker 1: They really rocked out and then they went through the charade of having an encore.

1048
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:29,841
Speaker 0: Yes And then of course their encore was like the fucking business.

1049
01:09:30,523 --> 01:09:32,169
Speaker 0: and then Jonathan Colton came out.

1050
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:35,060
Speaker 0: now If you don't know who he is, he's the dude who joke.

1051
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,044
Speaker 1: Oh, what's up?

1052
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:37,569
Speaker 0: He wrote the portal song.

1053
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:40,729
Speaker 0: You know, I'm not even angry.

1054
01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:45,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one yes, he he's basically the king of nerd music right now.

1055
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,993
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like he's.

1056
01:09:47,636 --> 01:09:49,783
Speaker 0: I won't say he's filthy cuz he's really not he's.

1057
01:09:49,844 --> 01:09:51,490
Speaker 0: I feel like he's a step up from Phil.

1058
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:53,877
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is really it is felt.

1059
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:55,985
Speaker 1: I mean, it's nerdy folk music.

1060
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,409
Speaker 0: Yes, but you listen to other.

1061
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,958
Speaker 0: Phil It does not sound like a is is the difference?

1062
01:09:59,998 --> 01:10:03,590
Speaker 1: is other people who do filk often do not have musical talent.

1063
01:10:04,052 --> 01:10:06,601
Speaker 1: Jonathan Colton is loaded with musical talent.

1064
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:11,038
Speaker 1: He can sing and play the guitar Many other instruments.

1065
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:13,789
Speaker 0: it was not Phil it was nerdy folk.

1066
01:10:14,434 --> 01:10:15,663
Speaker 0: Perhaps there's a difference.

1067
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,530
Speaker 0: It is real full.

1068
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,940
Speaker 1: You just want to give it a different genre because the quality is on another level.

1069
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:25,228
Speaker 0: because listen to Phil Phil is usually like cringeworthy inside baseball.

1070
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:29,677
Speaker 0: nerdery folk is Really soulful and I gotta say he's really.

1071
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:33,810
Speaker 0: I mean his flicker song especially with the flicker images up on screen.

1072
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,413
Speaker 0: That was actually.

1073
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:35,338

Speaker 1: Jonathan Colton is not only is he wicked awesome.

1077
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:43,430
Speaker 1: And is the thing is he spans the gaming crowds, right?

1078
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:48,590
Speaker 1: He's got the tech crowd right with his because he was a programmer before he was a musician.

01:10:48,971 --> 01:10:51,800
Speaker 1: He's got the gaming crowd with his portal stuff, right?

1101
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:04,524

1102
01:12:04,544 --> 01:12:05,186
Speaker 0: Okay.

1103
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:06,750

Speaker 0: She is so cool.

1105
01:12:07,974 --> 01:12:10,061
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, she's good at singing answers.

01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:10,703
Speaker 0: She covered.

1107
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,590

Speaker 0: and it was quite was great and you know, his concert was awesome.

1111
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,558
Speaker 0: But then he had visual components.

1112
01:12:23,618 --> 01:12:24,982
Speaker 0: cuz you know, he has this flicker song.

1113
01:12:25,002 --> 01:12:36,150
Speaker 0: and the deal with that was that he took Pictures from flicker that were Creative Commons Which is the point of the Creative Commons wrote a song about them and showed them during the song to the music.

1114
01:12:37,211 --> 01:12:41,185
Speaker 0: And he did this funny bit with the tech guy where he pulls up a bit this DVD.

Speaker 0: He's like put the day and yeah this back and forth.

1117
01:12:46,506 --> 01:12:47,650
Speaker 0: and the tech guy had a microphone.

1118
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:50,942
Speaker 0: He snarked back at him a few times and they totally did this.

1119
01:12:50,962 --> 01:12:52,387

01:12:56,266 --> 01:12:58,554
Speaker 0: play this one Not this one.

1123
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:03,310
Speaker 0: and they did like this eight minute or maybe it was like five minutes, but who's on first?

1124
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:04,051
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1125
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:09,650
Speaker 1: on third and of course the whole time the audience is like, you know, cuz it's basic psychology.

1126
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:12,590
Speaker 1: There's the one he's supposed to click on and the one he's not supposed to.

1127
01:13:13,152 --> 01:13:15,041
Speaker 1: Everyone wants to see that.

1128
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:16,929
Speaker 1: not supposed to one, right?

1129
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,496
Speaker 1: Curiosity you can't resist.

1130
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:21,580
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say this right now.

1131
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,010
Speaker 0: No one in that fucking room saw it coming.

1132
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:28,444
Speaker 1: Jonathan Colton saw it coming and so did up Bart the sound man.

Speaker 0: It started with a B much like lounge B. You see.

1135
01:13:34,049 --> 01:13:38,730

1136
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,540
Speaker 0: And then you know, he's like, alright, that's it.

1137
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,950

01:13:44,472 --> 01:13:45,015
Speaker 0: He's bored now.

1140
01:13:45,075 --> 01:13:47,648
Speaker 1: his real name was Brad, but he made a joke of calling him Bart.

1141
01:13:47,668 --> 01:13:49,054
Speaker 0: all the time I'm gonna call him bored.

1142
01:13:49,074 --> 01:13:51,385
Speaker 0: All right, cuz there's no more board license plates.

1143
01:13:51,405 --> 01:13:55,863
Speaker 0: He's totally screwed and The crowd's like click on it and boards like.

1144
01:13:55,883 --> 01:13:56,990
Speaker 0: so should I should I click on it?

1145
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,760
Speaker 0: And the thing is Jonathan Colton played it totally straight.

1146
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:01,387
Speaker 0: He's like no don't click on that.

1147
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:02,190
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

1148
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,052
Speaker 0: Let's just move on.

1149
01:14:03,534 --> 01:14:06,645
Speaker 0: So he just clicks on it and it was totally a Rick roll.

1150
01:14:07,006 --> 01:14:08,995
Speaker 0: It was the whole music video Just there.

1151
01:14:09,015 --> 01:14:11,370
Speaker 0: Uh, it was brilliant.

1152
01:14:11,752 --> 01:14:13,179
Speaker 0: And the thing is I didn't.

1153
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:16,253
Speaker 1: I didn't think a Rick roll could be brilliant again But there it was.

1154
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:18,340
Speaker 1: the whole crowd should have seen it coming.

1155
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:19,263
Speaker 0: No one groaned.

1156
01:14:19,364 --> 01:14:24,242
Speaker 0: Everyone basically said wow You got me you got us all.

1157
01:14:24,663 --> 01:14:26,350
Speaker 0: they played like half the music video.

1158
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:27,634
Speaker 0: It was super funny.

1159
01:14:27,734 --> 01:14:32,390
Speaker 1: is he really played sort of like this sort of slightly antagonistic of the audience.

1160
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:41,230
Speaker 1: He was like when people are yelling stuff at him like play this play that he was like, listen I have prepared a setlist to maximize your entertainment value.

1161
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:45,710
Speaker 0: But maybe I should just throw that all away and play free bird cuz someone yelled it.

1162
01:14:46,893 --> 01:14:48,990
Speaker 1: He's like yelling free bird at a geek concert.

1163
01:14:51,811 --> 01:14:55,844
Speaker 0: So, uh, then he pulls out this device and he talks about his.

1164
01:14:55,884 --> 01:14:58,433
Speaker 0: you know, he did a thing with like every Friday He used.

1165
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:01,410
Speaker 1: he did this thing called song a song a week where he played.

1166
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:08,057
Speaker 1: You know, maybe as he wrote a song every week for a whole year and like, you know after two weeks He ran out of songs are good.

1167
01:15:08,077 --> 01:15:08,941
Speaker 1: Most of them are bad.

1168
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:14,802
Speaker 0: So he tells the whole story about the mr Fancy pants song and then he basically pulls out the device.

1169
01:15:14,942 --> 01:15:19,550
Speaker 0: That was the only way he could make that song work The Zen drum.

1170
01:15:20,533 --> 01:15:23,070
Speaker 0: All I want to say about the Zen drum is that he did.

1171
01:15:23,453 --> 01:15:26,030
Speaker 0: It was a really great song as a result and he was really funny.

1172
01:15:26,613 --> 01:15:33,321
Speaker 0: That song was almost a stand-up comedy routine because of that device Reminiscent of Dana Carvey's stand-up back in the day.

1173
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:35,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, you want to know more about the Zen drum?

1174
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:48,113
Speaker 1: Basically, it's a MIDI controller that you can wear and then you know You touch the different parts of it to control whatever digital music you have prepared in advance and I didn't think He could.

1175
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:51,786
Speaker 0: I don't think Rick Roll could happen again, but he pulled out the Rick.

1176
01:15:51,806 --> 01:16:02,661
Speaker 0: the one he had was $1,300 just so you know, he pulled out the Rick Roll a third time but in such an unexpected Well done classy way that it was like wow.

1177
01:16:03,263 --> 01:16:04,285
Speaker 0: He got us again.

1178
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:07,710
Speaker 1: Oh my god I think you really hated the audience.

1179
01:16:08,635 --> 01:16:11,569
Speaker 1: You can almost think you really did hate us when he was doing that guys.

1180
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:15,628
Speaker 0: And the only other thing I want to say is that the encore that he put on.

1181
01:16:15,808 --> 01:16:19,260
Speaker 1: of course They went to the encore charade yet again.

1182
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:21,990
Speaker 0: Why must we go through this charade?

1183
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:24,421
Speaker 0: Charade, but he did it.

1184
01:16:24,743 --> 01:16:25,870
Speaker 1: just wanted to repeat myself.

1185
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:31,620
Speaker 1: They went through the encore charade for every band at both concerts every single time.

1186
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:37,090
Speaker 0: Jonathan Colton's encore was like that made my con.

1187
01:16:37,451 --> 01:16:37,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did.

1188
01:16:38,154 --> 01:16:41,810
Speaker 1: He did the zombies and then people are still yelling.

1189
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:44,578
Speaker 1: So he just played sweet caroline like whatever.

1190
01:16:44,838 --> 01:16:50,576
Speaker 0: yes, that was oh my god, so of course now it's like 2 25 a.m.

1191
01:16:50,617 --> 01:16:52,464
Speaker 0: And I went to oh my god.

1192
01:16:52,504 --> 01:16:56,140
Speaker 0: I had to go to bed and that Was Friday.

1193
01:16:56,422 --> 01:16:57,829
Speaker 1: there were two days left.

1194
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:03,690
Speaker 0: So at this juncture, I realized we've been talking for a long time.

1195
01:17:04,372 --> 01:17:05,495
Speaker 1: It's 10 p.m.

1196
01:17:05,555 --> 01:17:09,927
Speaker 1: Right now as we're recording this on Wednesday, and this is supposed to be Tuesday shows.

1197
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:21,685
Speaker 1: It's way overdue and We still have two days or one and a half days of packs to talk about, you know the full Saturday Which is the whole day of packs and then the Sunday which is almost the whole day

1198
01:17:21,826 --> 01:17:34,585

Speaker 1: Cuz you know, it's sort of like an e3 ish thing.

1201
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:51,791
