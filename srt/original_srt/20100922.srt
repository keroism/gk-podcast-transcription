1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,849
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday September 22nd.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,592
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:16,499
Speaker 1: I'm Ram and this is geek night tonight the sword.

4
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:29,138
Speaker 0: Let's do this So you might recall on the previous episode of geek nights.

5
00:00:29,198 --> 00:00:33,808
Speaker 0: We were distracted by a large Strange bright wasn't that large.

6
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:43,277
Speaker 0: it was very very bright light, and we couldn't figure out what it was Mm-Hmm, so shortly after doing the show we decided to actually try and figure out what it was.

7
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:52,739
Speaker 0: and you know Scott took the camera we were using for project st And we discovered that it was in fact coming from the top of the roosevelt island tram aka the Spider-Man tram.

8
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:54,779
Speaker 1: This is a that's what they're calling it now.

9
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:02,400
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone really knew what it was until they saw Spider-Man Uh-huh at least people outside of the city already, so that's what it was.

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,160
Speaker 0: It was just a light on top of that thing.

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,845
Speaker 0: But the reason it was so bright was that later it continued to blink But it was red.

12
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:11,591
Speaker 0: so it's ultra bright.

13
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:15,668
Speaker 0: and then when they put the red filter over it It is not nearly as bright.

14
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,320
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I see it blinking in the same position now.

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:28,060
Speaker 0: Yep, same position same pattern, but now it's red and now it is not so bright that it's painful even from miles away Mm-Hmm, I can't imagine what it was like being like in one of those buildings next to that thing.

16
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:35,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and it's weird to think the light is so crazy bright and only you know putting a plastic thing over it makes it.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,606
Speaker 0: I think all the colors were getting out now.

18
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,472
Speaker 0: Just red is getting out.

19
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,799
Speaker 0: all those other colors turn it into heat.

20
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,058
Speaker 1: Thing must be real hot like oh you touch it and you get burn.

21
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:48,603
Speaker 0: amaited That's it.

22
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:49,227
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

23
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:49,871
Speaker 0: Okay.

24
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,434
Speaker 0: That was the thing.

25
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:51,199
Speaker 1: Did you read that?

26
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,950
Speaker 1: The strange tales I did?

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,975
Speaker 1: how about that?

28
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:56,900
Speaker 0: it was pretty good.

29
00:01:57,141 --> 00:02:00,076
Speaker 0: I believe you geek-bited this on the last Wednesday night episode.

30
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:08,636
Speaker 1: I did indeed But I felt like mentioning again because you read it and I you know I want people really pay attention to it and purchase it because it was alright wasn't great.

31
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:09,759
Speaker 1: You don't think it was great.

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,744
Speaker 0: No, I don't think it was great.

33
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:11,486
Speaker 1: I think it was great.

34
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,413
Speaker 0: individual comics in it were great.

35
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:24,080
Speaker 0: I really really liked Spider-Man in the spider town And I liked the a lot of the really short one-off ones and the one where the kid gets his head popped off.

36
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:27,166
Speaker 0: But a lot of them were kind of.

37
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:29,814
Speaker 0: they were funny, and they were good, but they were good in that.

38
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:30,416
Speaker 0: kind of.

39
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,366
Speaker 0: check out this Generic indie comic.

40
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:35,997
Speaker 0: it's making references to things that you don't know a lot about.

41
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:36,720
Speaker 0: it's okay.

42
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,800
Speaker 0: It's probably funnier if you'd read that comic.

43
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,367
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the thing that the only thing I could say negative about it Right is that they had like this.

44
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:56,893
Speaker 1: the one they gave the most pages to is like the spider megalomaniac one which had a whole bunch of pages in the back right, but it's like the really good stuff like you know the Parry Bible Fellowship guy and Jason.

45
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,200
Speaker 1: they only gave him a few pages.

46
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:01,855
Speaker 1: It's like why couldn't the Jason one be like the whole back of the book at the same time?

47
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:04,285
Speaker 0: look at the Jason one and The Parry Bible Fellowship ones.

48
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,955
Speaker 0: they had clarity of vision and focus they had.

49
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,260
Speaker 0: this is my joke.

50
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,955
Speaker 0: I've made the joke as soon as I have made the joke and executed it.

51
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:12,498
Speaker 0: I'm done.

52
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:12,800
Speaker 0: That's it.

53
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:15,960
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, I'm not saying that they should not have removed the clarity.

54
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,545
Speaker 1: I'm saying they should increase the quantity.

55
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,852
Speaker 0: right maintain the VF guy.

56
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:22,560
Speaker 1: do ten one-off Joe exactly what I'm saying right?

57
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,366
Speaker 1: He doesn't need to do a whole strip But it goes on and on and on.

58
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:28,661
Speaker 1: he just needs to do more of the very focused high Like.

59
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:35,404
Speaker 1: if Jason did like ten three pagers for 30 pages, you know, I guess just if you get a 30 pager It'd be like

60
00:03:35,504 --> 00:03:50,479
Speaker 0: it was all over the place in terms of quality or at least in terms of my personal enjoyment And a lot of times something would happen in like one of the short ones and I would basically think all right This is clearly referencing something in that universe that I don't know about and it probably would be funny if I knew.

61
00:03:50,499 --> 00:04:00,740
Speaker 0: well I think I like how when you know in some anime you're watching that subtitled poorly, you know They made a Japanese pun and you get that a pun happened and you might even get like.

62
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,980
Speaker 0: well He said the word for tree, but blah blah blah blah, but you only find it funny because you knew there was a joke there.

63
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,778
Speaker 0: But you don't actually laugh at the joke itself because it's completely inaccessible to you.

64
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:15,900
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean, I think the thing is is that You know, it's like you're an indie creator.

65
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,260
Speaker 1: You don't get to draw a spider-man and Wolverine at least not commercially right too often.

66
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,940
Speaker 1: So you get this chance to draw it for real in a real Marvel comic.

67
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:32,060
Speaker 1: So you're basically those are the jokes that you've been holding on to Right all this time that you couldn't make because you need those characters to make the joke.

68
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,960
Speaker 1: Yep, and the joke is about the characters.

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:42,240
Speaker 0: so that's the kind of joke you're gonna get and I can't disparage the effort at all because That kind of inside joke is the kind of thing that I want in my own realm.

70
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,674
Speaker 0: I mean like when I want a video game joke like College Humor does a video game thing.

71
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:50,040
Speaker 0: if it's inside baseball It's a thousand times funnier to me and screw everybody else.

72
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's like if you're if you get finally get the chance to like put Wolverine in your comic for reals It's actually Wolverine not Wolverine, right?

73
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:03,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, or wolf this arena or lone wolf and oh wait, right.

74
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:05,680
Speaker 1: Well lone wolf came first.

75
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,900
Speaker 1: But the thing is you finally get this chance to do a spider-man comic, right?

76
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:23,368
Speaker 1: And if you just made it like a regular comic and you just happen to draw the main character as looking like spider-man But and he swung with webs But you didn't actually make any jokes about like J. Jonah Jameson or anything like that Then what the hell was the point?

77
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:32,746
Speaker 0: you could have just made that comic without the spider-man I guess the way who I would advertise this to seriously like if you're not into these sorts of comics, it's good It's worth reading.

78
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:38,780
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd buy it necessarily But if you are a fan of superhero underwear pervert those universes.

79
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:44,759
Speaker 0: This is pretty much the best gateway drug into indie comics the world has to offer you.

80
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:48,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I guess you get to laugh at jokes that you will understand.

81
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:48,674
Speaker 1: right.

82
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:53,479
Speaker 1: it's like if you like indie comics You'll like this book because all your favorite indie comic creators are in there.

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you like underwear perverts this has all your favorite characters in it.

84
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,560
Speaker 0: But other artists that you know styles you might never run across doing their thing and hopefully you can get the crossover going on.

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,524
Speaker 0: I guess it's the breed.

86
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:10,208
Speaker 0: the trouble is if you don't like indie comics and you don't like superhero comics You will not like this.

87
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:12,019
Speaker 1: I mean did you basically don't like comics?

88
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:19,498
Speaker 1: Which makes you pretty stupid because I mean that's like not like in movies or not like, you know, I don't know What if you're blind?

89
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,986
Speaker 1: Hey, listen what I know.

90
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:26,200
Speaker 1: this guy the comic pimp right and he is blind and he loves the comics.

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,144
Speaker 1: He is like the greatest.

92
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:27,666
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

93
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:28,510
Speaker 1: This guy is amazing.

94
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,760
Speaker 1: He leaves voicemails and like a bunch of comic podcasts.

95
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:32,227
Speaker 1: Ah, he is hilarious.

96
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:33,514
Speaker 0: What can we do to raise his eye?

97
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,700
Speaker 1: doesn't like nerdcore though?

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,089
Speaker 1: He like frequently complains that nerdcore sucks.

99
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:37,872
Speaker 0: Really?

100
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:39,297
Speaker 0: Yeah in particular.

101
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:41,268
Speaker 0: That's that's like saying Yeah, rap sucks.

102
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:46,099
Speaker 1: If we saw if we see him at the New York Comic Con I'll point him out to you because there is nerdcore that sucks.

103
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:47,849
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not gonna pretend there isn't.

104
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,136
Speaker 1: if we see him in New York Comic Con.

105
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:49,840
Speaker 1: We'll go talk to him.

106
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,639
Speaker 1: All right, cuz he's pretty awesome, huh?

107
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,105
Speaker 0: It's just interesting to me and I'm trying I'm not making light of this or making a joke But I kind of am.

108
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:02,694
Speaker 0: I laughed a tiny bit that the blind guys really into comics But really doesn't like some particular kind of music.

109
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:03,660
Speaker 1: I know.

110
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,945
Speaker 0: So You got any news for me?

111
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,220
Speaker 0: I know we really almost never have anime news anymore.

112
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,594
Speaker 0: So I'm assuming you've got some anime news.

113
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:13,620
Speaker 0: There's been all this time.

114
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,349
Speaker 0: So I assume something happened to the anime world.

115
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,657
Speaker 1: actually know there's a big comic book news, right?

116
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:27,314
Speaker 1: I mean great Okay, so anyway, this big comic news is basically, you know It's been sort of coming down the line right because there have been sort of like DC.

117
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:35,860
Speaker 0: It's basically it's a DC news, by the way God I don't like the Marvel Universe like just for what it is, but I don't like the DC Universe a thousand times more anyway.

118
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:40,560
Speaker 1: They've had some shakeups, you know in in recent history, right?

119
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,220
Speaker 1: But here's and they but what they've sort of been doing is they sort of doing it one step at a time, right?

120
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:53,546
Speaker 1: Instead of making one big earth shaking shakeup It's like they have phases almost in the shakeup and I don't know if this is the end or not But it looks pretty close to it.

121
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:56,600
Speaker 0: So this is a shakeup of the industry not of like the universe.

122
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,430
Speaker 0: Oh, no, there's five Batman's and one's on the moon.

123
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,252
Speaker 1: Oh, it's nothing like that.

124
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:04,103
Speaker 0: And there's some sort of infinity and terror Multiple worlds.

125
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:05,005
Speaker 1: It's enough from you.

126
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,211
Speaker 0: Okay, so hit you you little guy.

127
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:10,019
Speaker 1: basically, that's Marvel and Stanley.

128
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,720
Speaker 1: So Basically, what happened is right is zuda which is sort of their digital thing, right?

129
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,362
Speaker 1: They closed.

130
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:21,100
Speaker 1: the website was closed a while ago in a previous shakeup phase.

131
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:22,726
Speaker 0: I did not even know that happened.

132
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,794
Speaker 1: But now they're closing down the whole thing.

133
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,320
Speaker 1: So the zuda label is gone.

134
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,960
Speaker 1: Whoa, but you know any comics in zuda that are going to survive are going to survive.

135
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,389
Speaker 1: They're just gonna say DC on them instead of zuda on them.

136
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:34,952
Speaker 1: So what?

137
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,337
Speaker 0: so what like?

138
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,059
Speaker 0: why they shut it down?

139
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Speaker 0: Did they say because it wasn't making money?

140
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,533
Speaker 1: Also their Wildstorm right, which is also DC You know, they published Ex Machina and such right?

141
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:49,860
Speaker 1: Well Ex Machina is over.

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,166
Speaker 1: So they have no good comics left.

143
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:54,259
Speaker 1: and anyone who likes the remaining Wildstorm comics you suck because they suck.

144
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,787
Speaker 1: So they're shutting that down too.

145
00:08:56,928 --> 00:09:10,479
Speaker 1: and any remaining Wildstorm comics that they're gonna keep around will be say DC on them and Any all the Wildstorm characters that they're getting rid of right because those comics are ending or just canon them.

146
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:20,980
Speaker 1: those characters might appear in the DC Universe in some other book who knows and They fired I think like some percentage of the people at these places.

147
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:28,223
Speaker 1: It's a whole bunch of people lost their jobs and basically what they're doing is they're putting all the digital Stuff right.

148
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:32,420
Speaker 1: all DC's multimedia and digital productions are gonna be on the west coast.

149
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:35,860
Speaker 1: Well all their printing and publishing is gonna be in New York City.

150
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,100
Speaker 1: So it's like they're splitting it up two ways because really all their digital stuff is sort of way behind.

151
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,575
Speaker 1: You know even Marvel which is kind of slow is ahead of DC in terms of digital.

152
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:52,475
Speaker 0: in terms of digital content I note that neither Marvel nor DC have quite grasped webcomic.

153
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:53,378
Speaker 1: Well.

154
00:09:53,439 --> 00:10:00,800
Speaker 1: I know right It's like what they're really good at finding webcomic creators and eventually giving them a job doing regular old comics.

155
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:08,977
Speaker 0: But they I mean look at the media and finance Empire that penny arcade is and they still do not charge for penny arcade.

156
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,904
Speaker 1: I know right It's like look at Marvel right.

157
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:13,031
Speaker 0: They're doing a three panel strip.

158
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:20,200
Speaker 1: It's just don't ask me so Frickin and you know Gabe and Tyco are totally and Robert coup.

159
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,100
Speaker 1: They're definitely making more money than almost any of those comic creators at Marvel or DC with a contract.

160
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:26,350
Speaker 1: There is no question.

161
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:27,378
Speaker 0: and then look at things like dr.

162
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:27,981
Speaker 0: Ninja.

163
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:32,938
Speaker 0: if you say oh well, you know the comic book style format like we do wouldn't work in a webcomic.

164
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:36,310
Speaker 0: dr McNinja works as both both a comic and a webcomic.

165
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:36,812
Speaker 1: That's right.

166
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:37,394
Speaker 1: and dr.

167
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:37,835
Speaker 1: McNinja.

168
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:38,759
Speaker 1: He lives off there, right?

169
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,851
Speaker 0: Yeah He's doing all right assume, so I don't actually know.

170
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,635
Speaker 1: there's a lot of dr.

171
00:10:41,656 --> 00:10:42,380
Speaker 1: McNinja t-shirts.

172
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,587
Speaker 1: You walk down just the street no convention.

173
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,858
Speaker 1: You'll see the freaking shark high-fiving the the gorilla whatever it is.

174
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,520
Speaker 0: That's a good shirt.

175
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,733
Speaker 0: I only don't buy it because everyone else has it.

176
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:51,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway.

177
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:59,604
Speaker 1: So yeah, the shake-up is a pretty interesting shake-up right here, and it's shaky All right, so kind of.

178
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:05,423
Speaker 1: I kind of actually kind of glad because ex Machina ended and there's no good Wildstorm comics I think at all.

179
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:05,845
Speaker 0: What do they?

180
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,593
Speaker 0: what comics are there right now?

181
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,260
Speaker 1: Nothing you care about really?

182
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,673
Speaker 1: Like it's it's still.

183
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,279
Speaker 1: it's all crap.

184
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:19,139
Speaker 1: The only reason ex Machina was Wildstorm instead of vertigo right is because it's a superhero comic right you know.

185
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,259
Speaker 1: and vertigo Doesn't really do the superhero stuff.

186
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:26,580
Speaker 1: So you know cuz why the last man was vertigo all right and so his fables and all that stuff.

187
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,652
Speaker 1: So it couldn't be vertigo, but they didn't want.

188
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,760
Speaker 1: you know mayor hundred in DC Universe.

189
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:33,839
Speaker 1: You know you couldn't have Superman flying in.

190
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,834
Speaker 0: That would ruin everything I liked about the ex Machina work right.

191
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:39,220
Speaker 1: so they put it in the Wildstorm.

192
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,852
Speaker 1: That's the only reason it was over there as opposed to vertigo because it was a superhero comic And they didn't want to put it in DC.

193
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:50,640
Speaker 0: So they they only See just put it out and say it does not say it's in their fucking universe.

194
00:11:51,800 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 1: Because freaking nerds right the only people who buy these things And look at the labels and nerds and the nerds will go there And they'll see the DC label on it, and they'll see Brian K Ooh, and they'll buy it and they'll be like hey, where's Batman?

195
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,483
Speaker 1: The fuck see.

196
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,520
Speaker 0: Anime fans are one thing and like every fandom has its this is visa.

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,909
Speaker 1: Hey, I bought this comic right 20th century boys.

198
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,054
Speaker 1: It's his vis on the side.

199
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,579
Speaker 1: How come friggin luffy isn't it?

200
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:20,663
Speaker 0: What's the deal?

201
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:27,744
Speaker 0: I feel like comic fans in particular the really hardcore ones the ones who would say I am a comic nerd And I'm proud of it.

202
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:35,378
Speaker 0: the dude with a little rolly suitcase full of silver age silver surfer looking for the one issue of silver age silver surfer that he doesn't have.

203
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:39,610
Speaker 0: I Feel like any time you interact with that industry.

204
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:41,677
Speaker 0: It's like poking an anthill with a stick.

205
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,460
Speaker 0: Yeah So I actually have some anime news.

206
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,250
Speaker 0: This is actually pretty important news because I'm important.

207
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,019
Speaker 0: could it be because I don't pay attention to anime news And it stood out and I would have liked to known this sooner.

208
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,140
Speaker 0: So madhouse was actually doing an anime movie.

209
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't try gun movie.

210
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:05,560
Speaker 1: now aside from the dragon and they're doing Satoshi khan's movie that aside from that I saw lightning outside.

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,040
Speaker 0: There is another movie another movie that madhouse is doing that is already aired at some film festivals like two years ago.

212
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,576
Speaker 0: That's now it is premiering in Japan.

213
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:18,965
Speaker 1: wait If it aired two years ago What took them two years?

214
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:21,091
Speaker 0: fuck if I know maybe it was an incomplete version.

215
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:26,092
Speaker 0: a lot film festivals get incomplete versions of film So they polished it over to you I'm assuming.

216
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:26,654
Speaker 0: so I don't know.

217
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:28,906
Speaker 1: if it's got two years of polish You better be fucking good.

218
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:31,220
Speaker 1: So and it better not look like it's two years old either.

219
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:32,360
Speaker 1: It better look like it's from this year.

220
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,900
Speaker 0: So I'm linking to the trailer because it is premiering in Japan next month.

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,874
Speaker 1: Like early does it look like a new movie or does look like a two-year-old movie?

222
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:41,020
Speaker 0: It looks like a brand new move.

223
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:41,638
Speaker 1: All right, good.

224
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:52,760
Speaker 0: If I had to describe this just based on looking at the way it looks take wings of oni amis and mash it up With f-zero and remove any derp-de-der.

225
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,460
Speaker 1: Is there was an f-zero anime that was derp-de-derp.

226
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,214
Speaker 1: It was loaded with derp-de-derp and actually there's a lot of racing animes.

227
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,949
Speaker 1: wasn't there that studio I g1 production I g1 about racing?

228
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:03,852
Speaker 1: that I don't know.

229
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:05,036
Speaker 1: I don't think that was any good.

230
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:07,544
Speaker 1: and then initial D. Well, it's initial day.

231
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:08,346

Speaker 0: Great.

234
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,315
Speaker 0: You're getting distracted by things.

235
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:17,620
Speaker 0: The listeners can't see removing any Possible forgetting that this is a show that we're recording like in a studio.

236
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,640
Speaker 0: You're just like ah breaking walls all over the place.

237
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:24,600
Speaker 1: I get to look at the lightning and you don't cuz I'm looking at because I can look at the fucking audition and the fire wire.

238
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:31,965
Speaker 0: So sweet, it's important because one anime movie any anime movie if you're an anime fan You should see because there aren't that many.

239
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:38,944
Speaker 0: if you especially if you don't count Pokemon number X and one piece number Y Yeah, I'll pretty.

240
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:41,975
Speaker 1: I'll see pretty much any anime movie as long as it.

241
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:47,532
Speaker 1: the ones I'll skip though Besides the Pokemon X and the one piece Y are things like.

242
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:57,422
Speaker 1: I guess I'm not necessarily need to skip them But I you know I won't rush to see them necessarily are things that are attached to a TV series that I didn't see or I'm not interested in Like.

243
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,009
Speaker 1: I think they're those Pokemon.

244
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,740
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I think there was like a Eureka seven movie, right?

245
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,540
Speaker 0: I didn't even watch Eureka seven exactly.

246
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,216
Speaker 1: So, I mean, it's not you know, it's not some movie in a string of movies But it's also not a movie I'm gonna rush to see.

247
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,121
Speaker 1: I might see it I don't know.

248
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:16,700
Speaker 0: I'll put those at least for now in the same category as Pokemon X. All right, but it's madhouse.

249
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:22,056
Speaker 0: It's being directed by a guy named Takeshi Koike, and I'd never heard this was.

256
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,178

Speaker 0: The trailer looks really fun and it's I mean, I wanted the f-zero anime to be good, but it was stupid as shit.

272
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:33,159
Speaker 0: This is basically the f-zero anime done right as far as I can tell but animated really lushly.

00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:17,339
Speaker 0: We'll probably see it when it come in the Angelica or something when it comes to New York, hopefully.

292
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:26,625
Speaker 0: So things of the day, what do you have for me Scott?

293
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:27,430
Speaker 1: What do I have for you?

294
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:30,518
Speaker 1: So you are very familiar with the daikon animation.

295
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:34,510
Speaker 0: the daikon animation the thing that we show at like every anime con.

296
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,587
Speaker 0: Whenever we're trying to inspire kids the most people cry, but have you seen daikon 3 extra?

297
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,757
Speaker 0: Daikon 3 extra.

298
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:43,219
Speaker 1: Yep.

299
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,565
Speaker 1: This is daikon 3 extra.

300
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:48,890
Speaker 1: You're not hearing the audio You know because I just turned it off on my laptop.

301
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,789
Speaker 0: I saw someone linked to this recently, but I didn't watch it.

302
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,716
Speaker 1: It was on the Twitter.

303
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:54,730
Speaker 1: someone linked to it and that's how I found out about it.

304
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:08,288
Speaker 1: So here is daikon 3 extra and pretty much all it is is the daikon animation girl in her daikon You know her younger daikon form Transforming into a whole bunch of other characters sort of cosplaying.

305
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,540
Speaker 0: a whole bunch Happily recognize most of them.

306
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, and That's pretty much it.

307
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:15,940
Speaker 0: That is desperately cute.

308
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:21,226
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the kind of thing We got a whip out at a panel like at the end like hey, we got something for you.

309
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,597
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so there you go.

310
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:24,822
Speaker 0: So a while ago.

311
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:34,570
Speaker 0: Well a long time ago I read a webcomic and you know right when I was really getting into webcomics like really I was reading mega Tokyo Penny arcade.

312
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,317
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I just read penny arcade.

313
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,803
Speaker 1: I read here.

314
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,950
Speaker 1: I'm gonna run down my webcomics really quick.

315
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I have a bookmarks right open.

316
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,140
Speaker 1: Well, actually I read some newspaper comic so I can do those too.

317
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:54,750
Speaker 1: So Leo Li o is a newspaper comic Calvin and Hobbes that you can actually read it online and they cycle through the old ones in order.

318
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:55,910
Speaker 0: I've already read everything.

319
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,590
Speaker 1: The thing is the calendar that they're using doesn't match up with the real world calendar.

320
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,690
Speaker 1: So sometimes you read a Christmas comic in the summer.

321
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:09,970
Speaker 0: I think I've read every single Calvin and Hobbes to the point that seeing any one panel from one I can recall all other panels from it anyway.

322
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:14,864
Speaker 1: You know Dilbert just because sometimes it's not funny anymore.

323
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:19,963
Speaker 1: No, but you know, no Does its comic right even though it's often not funny.

324
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:38,090
Speaker 1: the people who do that are actually Like really good in terms of comics like they do all sorts of interesting, you know Like they're the only ones who are actually comic artists, you know Most of the people in the comic strip newspaper comic strip business Right are like Dilbert or Garfield where they just do panel panel panel character character character copy pasta, right?

325
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:49,010
Speaker 1: But the guys who do zits actually do like art and it's just cool to see like some of the stuff they do especially when they're doing like, you know real like big reactions of people, you know, like they'll have.

326
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:57,247
Speaker 1: For example, if the kid is like eating too much They'll draw like, you know, this like ridiculous like amount of food or just really exaggerated stuff.

327
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,050
Speaker 1: It's it's good arts.

328
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,440
Speaker 1: Let's see web comics real life.

329
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,267
Speaker 1: Just because of inertia.

330
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:09,283
Speaker 0: Wow, I Actually legitimately honestly forgot about real life until just that.

331

Speaker 0: She's never fucking updates.

346
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,176
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what's up love.

347
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:03,635
Speaker 0: way back in the day when I read any webcomic I could find I used to read a comic called The thin H line.

348
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,790
Speaker 1: it then later became sexy losers, but you don't read order the stick.

349
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:08,839
Speaker 0: I guess yeah, I do read order the stick.

350
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,310
Speaker 0: Okay, but I don't load it every day like once a week.

351
00:21:11,491 --> 00:21:13,199
Speaker 0: I'll kind of go back and read whatever.

352
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:13,600
Speaker 1: All right.

353
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:20,710
Speaker 0: But anyway, the thin H line Aka sexy losers was a perverted like sex comic.

354
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:30,995
Speaker 0: It was actually funny But it was dirty Really dirty and unabashedly dirty and a lot of his dar IT were into it and it was kind of a popular I wasn't.

355
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:32,261
Speaker 0: a lot of us were though.

356
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:32,803
Speaker 0: Greg read it.

357
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:33,506
Speaker 0: I think Pete read it.

358
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:34,149
Speaker 0: a bunch of us read it.

359
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:34,815
Speaker 0: It was all you.

360
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,509
Speaker 0: All right, it was funny.

361
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:41,210
Speaker 0: But anyway, I don't know how many people realize that there are a lot of dirty webcomics out there.

362
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:44,861
Speaker 0: Really funny you don't say so.

363
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:45,744
Speaker 1: are they the same?

364
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,318
Speaker 1: they're funny in the same way that You know, what's it called?

365
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:50,342
Speaker 1: The the elf?

366
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:51,246
Speaker 1: what the hell's that kind of?

367
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,150
Speaker 1: call them anime?

368
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,442
Speaker 1: So what the hell is that elf princess rain not elf princess rain the.

369
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,753
Speaker 1: oh elven bride elven bride That's the thing is.

370
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:01,039
Speaker 1: I kept thinking elven leader.

371
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:02,305
Speaker 1: I was like hell it's not elephant.

372
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:02,646
Speaker 0: No god.

373
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,563
Speaker 1: No god No, so I'm like elven something.

374
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:11,870
Speaker 0: well in that they're funny But they use sex or violence or something perverted to make the same kind of joke you'd get somewhere else.

375
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:17,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the problem is right is that we sort of have this, you know censorship going on, right?

376
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,935
Speaker 1: But it's not censorship that says, you know perverted comic you cannot exist It's censorship.

377
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:26,230
Speaker 1: that perverted comic must be separate from regular comic, right?

378
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,409
Speaker 1: so you have some comics that are totally without any pervertedness and some comics that are nothing but pervertedness.

379
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:47,187
Speaker 1: and Really, you know, there isn't a comic out there that's just has perverted stuff mixed in with regular stuff in a in a balance the same way that real life has a balance between Sex and not sex and that kind of comic doesn't really exist.

380
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:51,307
Speaker 1: so much, you know If you go and find like a hentai anime, it's got all sex.

381
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:52,993
Speaker 1: if it's comedy It's got all sex jokes.

382
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:56,544
Speaker 1: Every joke is about oh my god dildo got stuck where right.

383
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:58,771
Speaker 1: but if you read something that's not sexy There's.

384
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,279
Speaker 1: no there's no dildo jokes in it at all.

385
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,090
Speaker 0: So I have three comics for you three bad comics.

386
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,274
Speaker 0: They're bad in some manner.

387
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:12,856
Speaker 0: just to point out that there are comics out there that are weird or fucked up That you might not know about.

388
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,282
Speaker 0: All right, so let's start with fucked up.

389
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:15,748
Speaker 0: The parking lot is full.

390
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:17,594
Speaker 1: It's dead.

391
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:26,090
Speaker 0: it ended in 2002, but the archives are online and you might Occasionally hear someone in the FRC say something to the effect of it's goofy time.

392
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:28,675
Speaker 0: This is where that came from.

393
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:30,422
Speaker 0: this comic is fucked up.

394
00:23:30,462 --> 00:23:32,670
Speaker 1: you should link directly to the it's goofy time.

395
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,413
Speaker 0: I guess I should.

396
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,282
Speaker 1: it's a lot like the far side, but fuck.

397
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, not not.

398
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:40,720
Speaker 0: not sex humor Just really fucked up humor.

399
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,911
Speaker 0: It's like the far side the dark side And then sexy losers, which is you know The problem.

400
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:54,080
Speaker 0: Scott talked about where there are comics that are sex jokes or no sex jokes in the middle of the road This is just sex jokes.

401
00:23:54,341 --> 00:24:00,040
Speaker 0: Yep, and then there's a comic called Ogilaf and This does what Scott says.

402
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,623
Speaker 0: nothing does.

403
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:02,152
Speaker 0: it's one of the rare comics I don't know.

404
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,082
Speaker 1: I read it and most of the strips are about.

405
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:05,470
Speaker 0: most of them are but not all of them.

406
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,754
Speaker 1: Not all of them is true.

407
00:24:06,774 --> 00:24:07,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

408
00:24:07,838 --> 00:24:09,684
Speaker 0: I find this comic utterly hilarious.

409
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,590
Speaker 1: All right, I think it's all right.

410
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,158
Speaker 1: It's not that hilarious.

411
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:14,062
Speaker 0: No, it's it's.

412
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:14,745
Speaker 1: it's got some good.

413
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,650
Speaker 1: It's got some good ways.

414
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,440
Speaker 0: It's nowhere near even the good VG cats.

415
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:19,625
Speaker 1: There were some good ones in there.

416
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:20,930
Speaker 1: I kept clicking next for a while.

417
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:25,309
Speaker 0: The ones I like the most are the dwarf ones those fucked up little dwarves making their fucked up.

418
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,285
Speaker 1: really I sort of like the evil bitch Queen.

419
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:30,641
Speaker 0: Ah When the the sprites keep coming.

420
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:32,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

421
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:32,589
Speaker 1: That was good.

422
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,096
Speaker 0: These are all not safe for work.

423
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:40,790
Speaker 0: if I can't if you didn't get that impression you should write NSFW on the post.

424
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:41,794
Speaker 0: I definitely will.

425
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:46,249
Speaker 0: All right, so we read a comic the sword the sword.

426
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:55,850
Speaker 1: So basically this was actually recommended it to us by a listener at least a year perhaps two or more years ago Right, and that's how I even knew about it at all.

427
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,250
Speaker 1: Because really I never heard anyone discussing on any forums or podcasts or anything.

428
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:05,910
Speaker 1: But it was recommended by a listener and I looked into it and one day volume one was on sale.

429
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,123
Speaker 1: So ordered it and I read volume one and all that after reading volume one.

430
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,390
Speaker 1: I was like, well shit that is fucking hot.

431
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,235
Speaker 0: I was excited.

432
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:16,050
Speaker 0: Scott made me read volume one and I was like, yeah get the rest already.

433
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:22,850
Speaker 1: So then just recently the comic ended like the final issue came out and it's based on the elements, right?

434
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:24,763
Speaker 1: I mean how many things are based on the elements?

435
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:25,690
Speaker 1: almost everything?

436
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,009
Speaker 1: That's like the theme the go-to theme but you know, so what volume one is?

437
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:30,250
Speaker 1: earth.

438
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,879
Speaker 1: I forget which element is which volume but there's four volumes.

439
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,505
Speaker 1: are the four elements of earth air water and fire And I don't know the order because I'm not looking at him right fire water earth air.

440
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:40,006
Speaker 1: Those are.

441
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:40,870
Speaker 1: that's the four volumes.

442
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,453
Speaker 0: It's in the.

443
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:42,457
Speaker 0: it's in an order.

444
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,342
Speaker 1: Okay.

445
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:48,330
Speaker 1: Anyway, so The fourth volume just recently came out.

446
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:54,230
Speaker 1: So what I did is I ordered two three four And then I hadn't read one of the longest time since I got it for so cheap.

447
00:25:54,411 --> 00:26:03,530
Speaker 1: So I just I read one two, three four and I said, aha This is a comic that we can do a podcast about because it is only four volumes and I'll give it to him and he read.

448
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,354
Speaker 1: He actually read them.

449
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:04,936
Speaker 1: It's a miracle.

450
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we'll not spoil anything yet.

451
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,367
Speaker 0: We will spoil things into a full review, but we'll warn you before we get to that point.

452
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:14,005
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's a solid B comic.

453
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:14,650
Speaker 0: I enjoyed it.

454
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,764
Speaker 0: I think the first volume set up a lot of expectations and I don't think it Quite lived up to what I wanted, but it was good.

455
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:21,910
Speaker 0: I enjoyed reading it.

456
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,778
Speaker 0: I would not tell anyone not to read it.

457
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,190
Speaker 0: If you're a fan of comics, there's no reason not to read this.

458
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,260
Speaker 1: I definitely think the setup in volume one right.

459
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,428
Speaker 1: you read volume one and you're like, oh shit.

460
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:31,869
Speaker 1: Fuck.

461
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,250
Speaker 1: Yeah What the hell's going on here?

462
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:41,512
Speaker 1: Right, but it's one of those things where just the premise is so awesome and the guy obviously was thinking about that setup for a Long time.

463
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:43,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was done by the lunar brothers.

464
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,242
Speaker 1: So it's actually two guys.

465
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:46,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like Jonathan and Josh.

466
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:47,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're they're faint.

467
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,466
Speaker 1: They're pretty famous comic creators two J's.

468
00:26:49,888 --> 00:27:11,370
Speaker 1: Yeah But they you know, they obviously had that setup coming But then they spent only one volume with this awesome setup and giving you the premise but then three volumes of resolution of that premise and the resolution while satisfying at times and such, you know wasn't the as exciting as

469
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:16,192
Speaker 0: Volume was when I suddenly got really worried because as soon as the second volume ended I thought

470
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:16,513
Speaker 1: oh,

471
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,084
Speaker 0: that's how they're gonna end all of them now, isn't it?

472
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:26,727
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty much You know, the thing is is that the in the in the beginning right?

473
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:32,150
Speaker 1: It's like, okay There's there's a mystery like what the fuck is going on, you know, and it sort of just comes out in nowhere.

474
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:35,672
Speaker 1: You're really getting it from the perspective of the main character like oh shit What the fuck.

475
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,417
Speaker 0: and I really like.

476
00:27:37,497 --> 00:27:41,850
Speaker 0: it really comes out of nowhere in a way that few comics have been able to pull off.

477
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:48,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you know, there's totally tons of mystery and intrigue and it's like what the fuck is going on.

478
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,852
Speaker 1: This is crazy.

479
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:49,274
Speaker 1: Awesome.

480
00:27:49,354 --> 00:27:53,770
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh, but then pretty much right after that they tell you the whole story.

481
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,077
Speaker 1: They don't leave any secrets whatsoever.

482
00:27:56,659 --> 00:27:58,143
Speaker 1: So the rest of the comic.

483
00:27:58,184 --> 00:28:01,597
Speaker 1: you're not trying to discover anything anymore There's no more mystery to it.

484
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:02,179
Speaker 0: Now.

485
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:02,782
Speaker 0: You're just waiting.

486
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:04,149
Speaker 0: All right, how's this gonna end?

487
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:07,725
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess if I let me describe the premise so we can use less dodgy language.

488
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:08,570
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good premise.

489
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:11,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's a girl and she is in a wheelchair.

490
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,678
Speaker 1: Alright, so, you know from a car accident, I think right?

491
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:15,059
Speaker 0: Yep.

492
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,710
Speaker 1: And so he's just chillin, but she's living a relatively pretty good life.

493
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,138
Speaker 1: You know, she's got a her family.

494
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,565
Speaker 1: is you know, not doing too badly?

495
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:22,430
Speaker 1: her dad's a professor.

496
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,085
Speaker 0: The comic really just starts you out with kind of you know, this is her life.

497
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:25,870
Speaker 0: Everything's all cool.

498
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:29,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, she goes and you know, she's hanging out with her friends and her sister.

499
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,778
Speaker 0: Nothing is foreshadowed like.

500
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,773
Speaker 0: there is no hint of anything Interesting.

501
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:35,825
Speaker 1: The only foreshadowing is the girls in a wheelchair.

502
00:28:35,865 --> 00:28:36,549
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

503
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:42,250
Speaker 1: That could foreshadow almost anything, you know, it's it but it does come into play obviously.

504
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:47,606
Speaker 0: So basically then one night wait by that logic then not being in a wheelchair is also foreshadowing.

505
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:49,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess.

506
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,100
Speaker 1: But anyway, so just one night.

507
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,250
Speaker 1: well, they wouldn't you know, put her in a wheelchair on purpose.

508
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,210
Speaker 1: You know if it wasn't on purpose for a reason someone could just be in a wheelchair for no reason.

509
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, you wouldn't do that.

510
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:02,310
Speaker 0: There's a lot of works of art where someone just happens to be in a wheelchair.

511
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:06,470
Speaker 1: If you're writing if you're writing a comic happens to have a uterus.

512
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:12,429
Speaker 1: I mean if you're writing a web comic and the main character is in a wheelchair There's a reason you have done that.

513
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,609
Speaker 1: You don't do that.

514
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:18,950
Speaker 0: Surely a better reason of trying to include people like that or what if it's what you read the whole comic that was it?

515
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,526
Speaker 1: for a reason.

516
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,001
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kind of was.

517
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:23,130
Speaker 1: it kind of was so anyway.

518
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:24,354
Speaker 1: So, you know.

519
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,582
Speaker 1: one night there she's eating dinner with her family.

520
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,970
Speaker 1: her sister came home from because her sister doesn't live at home.

521
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:34,190
Speaker 1: She came over and the family's eating dinner together and these people just bust into their house.

522
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:40,828
Speaker 0: Well, no first they knock on the door and they come in and they're like, hey We're here to see your father and the dad's like, oh hi And he actually doesn't recognize them at all.

523
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:42,677
Speaker 0: And he's like, what do you want?

524
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:45,810
Speaker 0: And then they fucking go apeshit with magic and kill everybody.

525
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I guess it spoils volume one.

526
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,017
Speaker 0: That's like spoiling the cowboy.

527
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:53,770
Speaker 0: bebop is about some people in space who are bounty hunters.

528
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:57,870
Speaker 1: So basically, all right these people come into the house and they're like give us the goddamn sword.

529
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,781
Speaker 1: They're calling the dad by a different name, right?

530
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:01,926
Speaker 1: And it's that's it there.

531
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:05,038
Speaker 0: Give us the goddamn sword What sword don't seriously give us the sword.

532
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:06,082
Speaker 0: what the fuck you're talking about?

533
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:06,665
Speaker 0: murder murder.

534
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:07,749
Speaker 1: What's what's the name that?

535
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,015
Speaker 0: Demetrios to me.

536
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:10,590
Speaker 1: so they're like, all right, come on Demetrios.

537
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:16,070
Speaker 1: It's like so this girl is this sitting in a wheelchair is like why the fuck are they calling my dad Demetrios, right?

538
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,974
Speaker 1: That's not his name.

539
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:17,255
Speaker 0: Now.

540
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:19,847
Speaker 0: The violence is immediate and graphic.

541
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:24,806
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They freaking just rip the family up like they riggin like just boom your heads exploded.

542
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:25,207
Speaker 1: Boom.

543
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:30,390
Speaker 1: You're on fire You know over setting the house on fire and they're just having these mundane conversations with each other.

544
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,339
Speaker 0: So why isn't he talking blah blah blah?

545
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, three and the dad is just like what the fuck?

546
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,262
Speaker 1: Yeah, obviously it seems like there are these three people with magic powers.

547
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:41,489
Speaker 1: who have you know?

548
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:52,082
Speaker 1: They obviously are enemies with some guy named Demetrios who has a sword that they want and they think that this dad is Demetrios and they're the dad is just like what the fuck?

549
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:53,307
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're talking about.

550
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:54,009
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

551
00:30:54,029 --> 00:31:00,500
Speaker 1: and So they just use their magic and kill everybody And it's like whoa, what the what the fuck?

552
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:05,963
Speaker 1: So that is already comes out in nowhere And then he'll just knock on the door and then boom we're killing your family.

553
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:10,964
Speaker 0: now that could already set up a pretty good comic And this is kind of the last spoiler, but it's not a spoiler.

554
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:12,290
Speaker 0: This is like it happens right away.

555
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:13,939
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's in the title of the comic.

556
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously the sword is gonna come into play So long.

557
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:22,490
Speaker 0: story short she is the only survivor of this massacre and she falls into the basement and there's the fucking sword.

558
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:24,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just there right there.

559
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:26,316
Speaker 1: It's crazy how they that there was.

560
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:34,686
Speaker 1: like the number one most genius thing in the whole comic was how this like the dad Reacted like not at all to this conspiracy.

561
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,994
Speaker 1: That was apparently true like apparently he was Demetrios right or at least.

562
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:44,844
Speaker 1: or something is out or something is up because the sword that they were looking for was in his house in his basement right hidden down there, right.

563
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,994
Speaker 1: and So magic.

564
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:51,890
Speaker 1: people come looking for a sword, you know, and it is there.

565
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:57,170
Speaker 1: But the dad who you would assume was the one who would the one who knew about it, right?

566
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,729
Speaker 1: Totally didn't give anything away at all until the end and was killed like a lot.

567
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,544
Speaker 1: It's like if I had say a secret robot in the basement.

568
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:14,850
Speaker 1: the government came looking for it and I was like And I just said to the very end I don't know what you're talking about and they kill and I let them kill me Before I go and get in the robot and defend myself.

569
00:32:15,373 --> 00:32:17,870
Speaker 1: It's like if you have the secret robot you go get it and defend yourself.

570
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:21,090
Speaker 0: Maybe there's something else up that we don't know about it.

571
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,090
Speaker 0: Maybe we have to read the comic to see why the sword was actually there and what this whole story is.

572
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:32,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know basically it goes from there for three more volumes and you know, I think it was it's really original.

573
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,670
Speaker 1: I mean, I never read any story that you know went like that before, you know, usually if there's some sort of conspiracy, right?

574
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:52,681
Speaker 1: It's like it's uncovered and there's a hint about it and then it's revealed and then you know Whoever it was revealed comes out and spills the beans and that's the typical, you know Pathway, right or it's an Indiana Jones kind of thing where nobody knows.

575
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,849
Speaker 1: they can you know the secrets but they slowly discover them.

576
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:56,231
Speaker 1: The

577
00:32:56,332 --> 00:33:14,440
Speaker 0: only inter other thing I'll say and otherwise I mean We'll kind of end the review and get into the spoilers because I got some things to say about this comic having read it all is that the government pretty much does what you'd expect and that was surprising kind of like Uh Bocorano the government did exactly what you expect.

578
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:15,485
Speaker 0: There's a fucking robot.

579
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:16,087
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

580
00:33:16,248 --> 00:33:16,650
Speaker 0: Let's go.

581
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,136
Speaker 1: Well, it's not just the government right?

582
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:26,866
Speaker 1: It's like all kinds of characters are acting in you know in Intelligently based on the information that they have and the experience they've had right?

583
00:33:26,886 --> 00:33:28,290
Speaker 1: It's like they try something.

584
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,893
Speaker 1: It didn't work.

585
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:30,078
Speaker 1: So they're not gonna try that again.

586
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:32,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know and or I know this.

587
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:34,337
Speaker 1: therefore I'm gonna be smart and do this.

588
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:37,410
Speaker 1: Nobody does anything sort of stupider for no reason.

589
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:44,813
Speaker 1: they they I mean, you know, everyone sort of acts according to their motivations their goals and Intelligence.

590
00:33:45,154 --> 00:33:48,625
Speaker 1: nobody goes like crazy and does something stupid that they shouldn't have done.

591
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:54,302
Speaker 1: that causes unnecessary Conflict, you know the conflict the only conflicts are the real conflicts that matter.

592
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,696
Speaker 0: So other aspects the arts, okay It's kind of generic.

593
00:33:57,776 --> 00:33:58,804
Speaker 0: The dialogue is okay.

594
00:33:58,844 --> 00:33:59,590
Speaker 0: It's not gray.

595
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, the colors are really good, but the the art itself did not really blow me away.

596
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:08,444
Speaker 0: Literally one of those stories where the story itself kind of like Locke Lammer.

597
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:18,590
Speaker 0: Locke Lammer was not written particularly Well, it didn't have like it didn't have much going for it Other than the fact that the story it told was itself interesting and engaging and was a hell of a ride.

598
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,382
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm that the story matters more than the way the story is told.

599
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:27,520
Speaker 0: like this could have been a movie and in fact reading it It probably it probably be a good movie like this.

600
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:38,556
Speaker 0: In fact the panel I showed just a Luke Burge You know, I was hanging out with him Brian Park today and when he was like, yeah This art really does nothing to me for me and we discussed it and it really it Looks like storyboards to a movie.

601
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:41,766
Speaker 0: It might as well have been a comic or a novel or a movie.

602
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:42,610
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

603
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,239
Speaker 1: I wonder if it's been optioned.

604
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,250
Speaker 1: It doesn't say anything on Wikipedia.

605
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:55,085
Speaker 0: I guess the point I'm making is that you know sometimes there's a comic that uses the medium of Comic to do something interesting or a movie that couldn't be told in a comic.

606
00:34:55,366 --> 00:35:01,980
Speaker 0: or like the Prince of Nothing books You could make them a movie but they wouldn't be the same thing Because you couldn't tell the same story in the different medium.

607
00:35:02,802 --> 00:35:05,110
Speaker 0: this story stands independent of the medium.

608
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,539
Speaker 0: It's the kind of story like surrogates where I would say.

609
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, just make the fucking movie.

610
00:35:09,085 --> 00:35:10,290
Speaker 0: It'll be fucking awesome.

611
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:18,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's probably you know, I mean a lot of people these days are making comics You know first in hopes of it becoming a movie right as opposed to try because it's a better.

612
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,290
Speaker 1: It's a better luck than just sending scripts to producers

613
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,335
Speaker 0: But at the same time having

614
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:24,103
Speaker 1: them feel like tossed in the trash in

615
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:36,210
Speaker 0: a way that is hurting Comics because if you make a comic with that in mind You're really just storyboarding your movie and as a result, you might not be doing more artistic things You could be doing with the medium of a comic.

616
00:35:36,563 --> 00:35:42,589
Speaker 1: well yeah, but I mean the thing is anyone who could be doing artistic things within the comic medium are already doing them right.

617
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:48,370
Speaker 1: and This you know because this this being made doesn't block something else better being made.

618
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:55,778
Speaker 0: The only time we can actually complain is if someone who like if Jeff Lemire did a totally generic Comic that he wanted to make a movie.

619
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:57,043
Speaker 1: He's doing Superboy.

620
00:35:57,164 --> 00:35:59,633
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy the first 75 cents.

621
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:02,623
Speaker 0: Jeff Lemire is like we said way back.

622
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:03,766
Speaker 0: He was a rising star.

623
00:36:03,846 --> 00:36:05,070
Speaker 0: And yeah, he's a rising star.

624
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:06,284
Speaker 1: We'll see if it's any good.

625
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:06,708
Speaker 0: We'll see.

626
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:09,463
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this is totally worth reading.

627
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:10,930
Speaker 0: It's like a BB plus comic.

628
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:16,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get it from like the library or if you can buy like some used borrow it from someone.

629
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:24,685
Speaker 1: It's for trades, but I think two months from now or like in November They're gonna come out with like this complete edition like one hardcover.

630
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:25,709
Speaker 1: That is the whole thing in it.

631
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:27,989
Speaker 1: So, I don't know which one's gonna be cheaper.

632
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:35,790
Speaker 1: Maybe the hardcover will mean you can get the four trades at a discount, you know Look, just try to save money when you buy it, you know get the four trades get the hardcover.

633
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:38,522
Speaker 1: Getting all the issues is probably gonna be a pain in the ass.

634
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:39,950
Speaker 1: It's 24 individual issues.

635
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:46,141
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's that's not an easy easy purchase especially since they came out over the course of two years.

636
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:51,131
Speaker 1: issue one was in April 08 and The last issue was in July 2010.

637
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:51,874
Speaker 1: So it's not gonna.

638
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,090
Speaker 1: it's not gonna be easy to get every issue if you weren't buying them all along.

639
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:59,908
Speaker 0: So very briefly before we get on to the spoilers, we forgot to do the meta moment.

640
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,848
Speaker 0: Oh shit I only have two things I want to talk about because this is a Wednesday night show.

641
00:37:02,868 --> 00:37:07,470
Speaker 0: on October 8th 9th and 10th is the New York comic-con New York anime festival in New York City.

642
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,430
Speaker 0: We'll be doing a panel on Friday night and it's gonna be awesome.

643
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,108
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a big mega con the first double con like this ever.

644
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:21,710
Speaker 0: Yep It'll be something to see the weekend before that on Saturday afternoon at Kinokuniya in New York City in Manhattan.

645
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,016
Speaker 1: But we definitely definitely doing.

646
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:24,744
Speaker 0: we are doing an event there.

647
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,130
Speaker 0: I cannot say more yet.

648
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:32,190
Speaker 0: We will be there doing a half-hour kind of mini panel event and we'll be able to hang out answer questions.

649
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:44,450
Speaker 0: So if you're a fan and you want to actually see us talk to us hang out say hi I'm Saturday October 2nd at Kinokuniya is a much better chance of seeing us in a position where we are able to talk to you.

650
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,260
Speaker 0: Then the New York comic-con New York anime festival will be.

651
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:52,230
Speaker 1: we'll also be at 10 10 10 the burning wheel con Over the same weekend as the double mega con.

652
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,979
Speaker 1: but who knows which times will be at which kind of which times?

653
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:55,681
Speaker 1: the other who knows?

654
00:37:56,323 --> 00:38:00,357
Speaker 1: and the book club selection is Ray Bradbury's golden apples of the Sun.

655
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,967
Speaker 0: next Thursday or so we will be doing that.

656
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:03,650
Speaker 1: I'm almost done.

657
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,399
Speaker 1: I got like the two or three more stories to read.

658
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:08,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you've already read then the story That is my favorite far and away.

659
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:10,284
Speaker 1: Is it the one about television?

660
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:11,590
Speaker 0: That's a good story.

661
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,841
Speaker 0: No, mine's the one about the Emperor and the flying machine.

662
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:15,986
Speaker 1: Oh, that's okay.

663
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:17,150
Speaker 0: one just for the line at the end.

664
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:17,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good one.

665
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:23,540
Speaker 0: The line at the end sells that story because that that story I think has the most practical Application to modern day of any of the stories.

666
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely.

667
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:27,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Spoilers if you have not read the sword.

668
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:30,054
Speaker 0: do not fucking listen any further I'm.

669
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:35,523
Speaker 0: or if you never plan on reading the sword No, no You should read the sword because what we're gonna do is tell you all the events.

670
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:37,510
Speaker 0: if you know what's going to happen.

671
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:40,626
Speaker 0: There is little artistry in the way it is told.

672
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:41,330
Speaker 0: toward the end.

673
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:41,894
Speaker 0: You will not.

674
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,170
Speaker 0: you will lose much of the enjoyment of reading.

675
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though I've already described the first issue to you It's still really, you know, that's not.

676
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:51,570
Speaker 1: I sort of knew what the first issue was about a little bit before I read it.

677
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,758
Speaker 1: Not much, but it'll still be good.

678
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:54,822
Speaker 1: It's not spoilable.

679
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:55,104
Speaker 1: Right?

680
00:38:55,405 --> 00:39:00,077
Speaker 1: But the rest of the comic is Pretty just you know, it's just the story.

681
00:39:00,098 --> 00:39:05,055
Speaker 1: So if I tell you the story, it's not spoiling it as in oh Ruined a surprise.

682
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:08,790
Speaker 1: It's spoiling it as in it's completely redundant with the comic.

683
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:17,273
Speaker 0: You know I'm giving you the pretty much the exact same experience moments later where a fact about the way the sword works is revealed which has Ramifications.

684
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:23,230
Speaker 0: and now you wonder well, how are those ramifications gonna make this especially when you think back to like the family on the boat?

685
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,970
Speaker 0: Oh my god, and the answer to that is poorly very poorly.

686
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:31,210
Speaker 0: So spoilers from this point forward.

687
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:37,086
Speaker 0: I was kind of surprised by the fact that the story was actually simpler than I expected.

688
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:41,043
Speaker 1: I find this lately Yeah, I mean cuz it starts off with a conspiracy.

689
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:42,330
Speaker 1: That's sort of strange.

690
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:51,049
Speaker 1: So you you think it's gonna get twisted entangled and become this dark spiral like those TV shows You know where they just keep throwing mystery after mystery at you.

691
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:53,600
Speaker 1: But really they just come out and explain it like nope.

692
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,222
Speaker 1: Here it is.

693
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:59,830
Speaker 1: And even though it's really fantastic It's you know, it's got lots of fantasy involved in magic and craziness.

694
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:06,429
Speaker 1: It's not complicated and then they just go about resolving it in a relatively straightforward procedural way.

695
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:14,055
Speaker 0: But I think it's funny how usually even though there's also suspense stuff has a twist or something you didn't expect even if it isn't A twist or something you didn't figure out.

696
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:18,590
Speaker 0: and that's what I expect from media because that's what's popular now.

697
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:19,435
Speaker 0: And it used to be.

698
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:20,986
Speaker 0: that was kind of like the crazy thing to do.

699
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:27,830
Speaker 0: now It's almost like the crazy thing to do is to tell a straightforward story where all the craziness is not what happens.

700
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:28,411
Speaker 0: Like.

701
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:31,980
Speaker 0: I assumed from the beginning that the dad was not Demetrios.

702
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:35,930
Speaker 0: really my assumption was he was like Demetrios his great-grandson.

703
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:42,550
Speaker 0: That's why he looked so much like him and or like son or something and the real Demetrios was hanging out somewhere.

704
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,242
Speaker 0: The sword was buried in the basement and he really didn't know.

705
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:46,950
Speaker 1: Okay, that's that's reasonable.

706
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:55,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I assumed that right up till the end and I assumed further later that Justin Are you assume that until up until the end up until when Justin revealed I was like, oh, he's Demetrios.

707
00:40:57,113 --> 00:41:06,630
Speaker 0: And then he was like no, I'm face whatever I was like, oh really because I assumed he was alive too because the falling into the fire consumed by his own that was bullshit.

708
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:08,175
Speaker 0: Obviously he was still alive.

709
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:08,516
Speaker 1: Actually.

710
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,885
Speaker 1: That's the one thing that totally got me right.

711
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:17,850
Speaker 1: was the that you know The I believe the lie all along that the kid was in the clay in Demetrios his class.

712
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:21,305
Speaker 0: I believe that too, but I did not believe that the fire lord was dead.

713
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:26,750
Speaker 1: Oh See I totally believe that they were dead because you saw them get chopped up with this.

714
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,270
Speaker 0: No, you saw him got stabbed not deadly and then he fell into a pit and caught on fire.

715
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:32,737
Speaker 1: No, okay.

716
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,364
Speaker 1: You're thinking a little bit too hard about.

717
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:42,230
Speaker 0: I thought about it very literally Yeah, but also along those lines the fact that it was meta foreshadowed only but not actually foreshadowed.

718
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,941
Speaker 0: I mean look the name of each book is who dies in that book.

719
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:45,584
Speaker 1: That's right.

720
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:52,228
Speaker 0: and fire book book one Duh, but then alright, I'm gonna go the reverse of that because I expected all these more complicated things.

721
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:52,890
Speaker 0: that didn't happen.

722
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,150
Speaker 1: Yep, now but pretty much that's it.

723
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,872
Speaker 1: You know in the fire book the fire guy dies in the water book the water guy dies earth air, you know It's pretty much.

724
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:01,318
Speaker 1: it is four people.

725
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:02,482
Speaker 1: They die one per book.

726
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:03,707
Speaker 1: one, two, three four.

727
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:08,605
Speaker 0: so game over There are only two moments of violence that I was actually taken aback by like I.

728
00:42:08,846 --> 00:42:11,376
Speaker 1: oh really it took you aback We're not taking it back.

729
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:15,982
Speaker 0: Like I mean, I've seen each of the killer and didn't blink in fact laughed handily That's true, but there were two moments.

730
00:42:16,043 --> 00:42:23,850
Speaker 1: I was like, oh ah Usually usually I went oh and ah when limbs were just sliced off by the sword that didn't get me so much.

731
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,142
Speaker 0: What got me was when she ripped her fucking uterus out?

732
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:29,250
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that really got me.

733
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,185
Speaker 0: So I was like, did she rip her stomach out?

734
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:33,419
Speaker 0: Oh, oh Oh.

735
00:42:34,974 --> 00:42:43,970
Speaker 0: And then when the jog got popped off Oh, yeah, right because those two moments came back to me when I realized let go of the sword and all your injuries come back.

736
00:42:44,593 --> 00:42:47,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz the sword has healing powers as well as killing powers.

737
00:42:47,933 --> 00:43:08,070
Speaker 1: But at the very end of the book very close to the end They sort of come out and they're like, yeah the healing powers of the sword sort of get undone if you You know, let go of the sword Touching it over and over and over again To reheal and I sort of felt like that was sort of tacked on at the end a little bit.

738
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,035
Speaker 1: it didn't feel like that.

739
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:20,315
Speaker 1: that was foreshadowed a whole bunch, but Whether it was tacked on or not It actually fit really well because all throughout the book like she had been stabbing and healing people like that guy in the boat Right.

740
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,270
Speaker 1: He gave her the free ride.

741
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:25,890
Speaker 1: People are dead all those people and it's like oh shit even better.

742
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:31,189
Speaker 1: And it also gives them a reason for her to die at the end, you know as opposed to just you know.

743
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:35,850
Speaker 1: Have it without having to answer the question of what the fuck is she gonna do for the rest of her life with the sword?

744
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:41,495
Speaker 0: Now at the same time what got me was that the moment that's revealed when she's like my bullet wound came back I was like, oh shit.

745
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:44,350
Speaker 0: So at the end she's gonna have to go back to being a paraplegic again.

746
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,095
Speaker 0: I wonder how they're gonna.

747
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:45,720
Speaker 0: and then I stopped.

748
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,684
Speaker 0: I was like, oh wait She had her fucking jaw punched off and all her arms caught.

749
00:43:49,704 --> 00:43:58,450
Speaker 0: Oh The other violent moment when she had to rip the flesh off of her own body multiple times to reheal properly.

750
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:01,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that was rough real rough.

751
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,010
Speaker 0: Of course notice how rapidly she turned into a consummate badass.

752
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:07,735
Speaker 1: That's what's gonna happen.

753
00:44:07,935 --> 00:44:14,550
Speaker 1: if you know, especially if you've you know, you probably imagine what it feels like, you know I mean someone punches your jaw off, right?

754
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,444
Speaker 1: You didn't do that on purpose and then touch a sword and it heals right?

755
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:18,550
Speaker 1: Imagine what that feels like.

756
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:23,910
Speaker 1: So if you felt that it's like just cutting some flesh off your leg and doing it is not it's like whatever.

757
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:27,510
Speaker 0: Here's the roller coaster situation was totally foreshadowed in one way or the other.

758
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:28,132
Speaker 0: How come?

759
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:30,802
Speaker 0: he never took a bullet and survived all that crazy bullshit.

760
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:31,685
Speaker 0: She was doing at the end.

761
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:37,890
Speaker 1: I I just wasn't thinking about it that hard, you know, I just sort of went along with it.

762
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,369
Speaker 0: I was kind of thinking he was Dimitrios.

763
00:44:40,032 --> 00:44:41,718
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it's like, you know, I like.

764
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:44,770
Speaker 1: there were certain things that like I was obviously questioning all the time.

765
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,740
Speaker 1: But that one thing totally fooled me up until the end.

766
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,910
Speaker 0: What was hacked on is the whole how come your hair's different color?

767
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:56,210
Speaker 0: How come your hair is not impervious to damage like everything else and one they made him bald when he caught on fire.

768
00:44:56,331 --> 00:44:57,074
Speaker 0: So that was okay.

769
00:44:57,275 --> 00:44:58,823
Speaker 0: and she was like, oh, yeah dead skin doesn't count.

770
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:03,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, duh Whatever death note handled things like that a lot better.

771
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:04,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely think so.

772
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:13,210
Speaker 1: The other thing is that it was cool how as the progression of fire water earth air the bad guys were smarter each time.

773
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:13,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

774
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:18,770
Speaker 1: It's like the fire guy was just you know, the typical angry moron, you know the water guy.

775
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,439
Speaker 1: He was sort of worried a whole bunch, but he got his.

776
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:24,589
Speaker 1: the earth guy was he was the drug dealer in Mexico, right?

777
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:35,645
Speaker 1: He he actually has the freakin brains, you know, he didn't have big enough brains even when he turned into a giant Which is totally freakin awesome, but you know, his problem was overconfidence.

778
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:37,270
Speaker 0: It was not like tricked at the end.

779
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,324
Speaker 0: She was too smart and then suddenly got stupid.

780
00:45:39,525 --> 00:45:40,270
Speaker 1: that that's true.

781
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:45,650
Speaker 1: But she was way smart, you know when she start hurt her whole thing up until her demise.

782
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,977
Speaker 1: She was doing way smart awesome stuff.

783
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:53,441
Speaker 0: earth guy gets points for making a giant robot out of mud And then trying to kill with that.

784
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:54,730
Speaker 1: that's that's a genius idea.

785
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:58,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just you know, if he wasn't so confident he would he would have pulled it off, too.

786
00:45:58,752 --> 00:46:01,019
Speaker 1: But yeah, the the air girl was just.

787
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,275
Speaker 1: she was so smart pretending to be the good guy making the girl out to be the bad Guy, but then it was.

788
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:11,856
Speaker 1: I liked it because it was a really cool redemption when the military guy was like, alright I know what's up.

789
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:12,703
Speaker 1: Yeah.

790
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:13,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like fuck.

791
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, military guy who knows what's up?

792
00:46:15,538 --> 00:46:16,422
Speaker 1: is it yours like?

793
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:18,130
Speaker 0: I hope you don't kick me in the balls.

794
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:18,895
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen?

795
00:46:18,915 --> 00:46:21,170
Speaker 1: I don't know the exact title of the movie.

796
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,500
Speaker 1: it might be in invaders from Mars or something where you could.

797
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:30,283
Speaker 1: it's like the guy the kids in the school nurse and Like they're the only people who aren't fucked up.

798
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:31,650
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and they go to the military.

799
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,053
Speaker 0: They're like, oh and the military is like, alright Well help you.

800
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:43,170
Speaker 1: anyone who has a band-aid with a little mark on the back of their neck is been infected by the aliens Right and everyone else is totally chill and there's almost no one left.

801
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:43,893
Speaker 1: He's totally chill.

802
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:46,084
Speaker 1: and they go to the military and like let us see the back of your neck.

803
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,475
Speaker 1: and he's like, okay And he wasn't he was chill.

804
00:46:48,796 --> 00:46:50,041
Speaker 1: so they were like listen this aliens.

805
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:58,345
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh, and the military was like really Did that - they're like the kids are like there's fucking giant robot blah and this thing.

806
00:46:58,425 --> 00:46:59,850
Speaker 0: and then the military guys like show me.

807
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,521
Speaker 0: And then they show him and he's like, oh that's becoming a trend.

808
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:04,630
Speaker 1: that the military is smart and gets involved.

809
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:06,869
Speaker 1: We're gonna need to go back to the military is stupid again.

810
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:12,657
Speaker 0: I think that the real trend is that you can no longer get away in media with having They're not like.

811
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:16,802
Speaker 0: Emily and I watched the burbs again recently a movie I hadn't seen in a long time and it's still a funny.

812
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:18,210
Speaker 1: just go check out the dude's basement.

813
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:22,426
Speaker 0: But what doesn't win is they don't just call the police when they find the goddamn femur.

814
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:24,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Yeah, just call the police.

815
00:47:24,473 --> 00:47:26,019
Speaker 0: It's a femur exactly.

816
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:47:26,902 --> 00:47:28,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, and movies can't get away.

818
00:47:28,668 --> 00:47:29,370
Speaker 1: That's a comedy.

819
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,370
Speaker 1: It's not a. you know, this is not a comedy.

820
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:31,992
Speaker 1: So you're not.

821
00:47:32,012 --> 00:47:38,013
Speaker 0: you're not questioning about the police in the burbs because it's supposed to be the fact that the clo packs go and call The police themselves.

822
00:47:38,474 --> 00:47:38,976
Speaker 1: That's true.

823
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:44,269
Speaker 1: But you know in it's something that's procedural or suspenseful with danger, right?

824
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:48,370
Speaker 1: You need a reason to not call the police like look at monster right and monster.

825
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,358
Speaker 1: Why doesn't he call the police?

826
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:50,567
Speaker 1: cuz he'll go to jail.

827
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:55,450
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like they give you a reason not to just go for some obvious answer.

828
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:06,623
Speaker 1: They make it so that the daring and suspenseful and brave option of incredible danger and action is Also, you know the only way for the good guys to make it.

829
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:08,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes it's the contrived moral dilemma.

830
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:10,740
Speaker 0: I mean try gun every episode.

831
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,026
Speaker 0: the answer is you could just shoot him.

832
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:14,213
Speaker 1: Yeah No, you know.

833
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:19,090
Speaker 1: but that they always make some sort of reason not to do the obvious things so that you know.

834
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:25,630
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you know crawling through the vents and being a total badass and stealing guns or whatever is not the best idea.

835
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:29,026
Speaker 0: So my only real complaint about the comic is the n1.

836
00:48:29,588 --> 00:48:34,481
Speaker 0: as an aside I really like the fact that their names are all the names of the cities They took over from ancient Manoa and Crete.

837
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:35,144
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

838
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:37,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, like setup I also like how.

839
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:39,870
Speaker 1: you know, they had a dad but he never came into it.

840
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:41,597
Speaker 0: They kept praying to God and that didn't.

841
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:44,510
Speaker 1: one one of them did but the other one they were bring to their dad.

842
00:48:44,831 --> 00:48:48,290
Speaker 1: But some of them didn't believe in their own dad anymore, but I like how that didn't help at all.

843
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:48,712
Speaker 1: It's like.

844
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:49,776
Speaker 1: it's so weird though.

845
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:52,810
Speaker 1: Cuz like if I had magic powers, right?

846
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:56,480
Speaker 1: And I know I had them and no one does.

847
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:02,521
Speaker 1: and I grew up with no dad and my mom was like Yeah, some magic dude and disseminated me with magic.

848
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:06,779
Speaker 1: I'd be like, well, it might not be God But there was definitely some magic insemination.

849
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,704
Speaker 1: That was my dad.

850
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:11,189
Speaker 1: So whatever it is You know, I would thank it.

851
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:20,730
Speaker 1: I might not pray to it or worship it, but I would thank it and seek it out You know, yeah, cuz it's definitely real as is evidenced by my ability to set things on fire.

852
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:27,347
Speaker 0: But on the meta level the only thing that really bothered me was that Characters kept fucking having to explain everything that they knew.

853
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:30,546
Speaker 0: the characters They met along the way and they're just words and words and words.

854
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:31,230
Speaker 0: I just had to skip.

855
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:32,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kept every time.

856
00:49:32,857 --> 00:49:35,730
Speaker 0: it wasn't just that it was throughout the entire comic after the first volume.

857
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,681
Speaker 0: I didn't read all the words.

858
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:43,790
Speaker 0: I would just be like, alright They're talking about this and I would literally skip all the word bubbles until I got to word bubbles that talked about something.

859
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,405
Speaker 1: Well, you're definitely, you know, none of them miss anything is disgusting it with you.

860
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:48,529
Speaker 1: There's nothing you missed right?

861
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:49,950
Speaker 0: Yeah Nothing happened at all.

862
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:57,270
Speaker 1: I definitely think people need to learn the lesson of if you have a story right and a character is explaining something to another character That's already the golden.

863
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,890
Speaker 0: Yes, it would literally have a sentence saying so and so like the story.

864
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:03,256
Speaker 0: Yeah so it's a part about blah.

865
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:10,181
Speaker 1: I think part of the reason for that is because we're reading the trades and They've made it, you know, it's a comic.

866
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:19,768
Speaker 0: So if someone buys issue like 17 if they don't know what's up That's the excuse they use in TV shows to make them non-serial to have recap episodes all the time.

867
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:21,654
Speaker 0: Mmm I don't get a recap.

868
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:22,897
Speaker 1: episodes are just filler.

869
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:27,250
Speaker 1: but you know having some sort of explanation in the individual episode.

870
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:32,710
Speaker 1: But also just honestly because I mean, I'm not gonna say that I agree that that I disagree.

871
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:35,470
Speaker 1: I mean having too much of that recap is sort of annoying and stupid.

872
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:36,815
Speaker 0: Wasn't just the recap?

873
00:50:36,835 --> 00:50:38,221
Speaker 1: you're selling a comic.

874
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:39,465
Speaker 1: that's an individual issue.

875
00:50:39,506 --> 00:50:40,630
Speaker 1: I don't care what numbers on it.

876
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:47,536
Speaker 1: It needs to stand alone as a work and if it's not comprehensible on its own, you shouldn't make these spider-man 121.

877
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:48,669
Speaker 1: Yes, you shouldn't do that.

878
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:56,350
Speaker 0: But a lot of the dialogue between the characters was really really boring and I didn't care and I just like it wasn't necessary.

879
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:09,947
Speaker 0: they're snarking at each other in this really contrived force way like the dialogue was so expository and Non-natural that it really and I I skipped word bubbles any time It didn't like directly drive the story forward and I didn't miss anything.

880
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:13,638
Speaker 1: Nope No, that's that's what happens in a comic like that.

881
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:24,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but on the story level and this isn't a complaint this is just something that I In her situation even with all of her circumstances would not have acted the way she acted.

882
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,801
Speaker 0: I would not have gone on murderous rampage.

883
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:30,350
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, I Wouldn't gone on a murderous rampage.

884
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,703
Speaker 0: She made the point to the earth guy of you know, you all.

885
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:37,023
Speaker 0: you say you're a god But you can only create what men can see.

886
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,790
Speaker 0: you've never created anything on your own.

887
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:48,710
Speaker 0: I feel like she should have broken the cycle of Dimitrios and gone to all of them and subjugated them and made a deal and They all come out openly to the world and she uses the sword to keep them in line.

888
00:51:49,031 --> 00:51:53,330
Speaker 0: But yet they could use their powers for the better of everybody which is what they all kind of wanted to do all along.

889
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:55,385
Speaker 1: Well, I mean one guy was dealing drugs.

890
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:56,070
Speaker 1: They weren't they didn't.

891
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,709
Speaker 1: Everybody convinced them.

892
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:05,708
Speaker 0: I mean Dimitrios once you see like what he was actually doing and he He was kind of a dick and wasn't really dealing with the situation that.

893
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:10,608
Speaker 1: well Well, cuz he just wanted to live and do his own thing and he just didn't want the whole world to end.

894
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:17,037
Speaker 0: at the same Time he didn't know he wasn't trying to force them to be human which was bullshit But at the same time went without him.

895
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:30,564
Speaker 0: there were being gods and there were also independently of being gods being dicks And I feel like he could have made them into gods that weren't dicks But instead he was just having sex with one of them and kind of being a dick himself and trying to force them to be Something they could never be.

896
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:41,450
Speaker 1: He didn't want to kill anybody right, you know, especially not a god But you know plus like they could have come in useful like let's say if there's a meteor coming to earth or something?

897
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were basically the Fantastic Four.

898
00:52:43,891 --> 00:52:49,897
Speaker 0: So instead of you know, you know dealing with mother the evil Fantastic Four They could have been I guess I don't.

899
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:59,086
Speaker 0: she was presented with an opportunity of transhumanism and her choices were Become a transhuman and let's go with this or give up the sword and die in the end after killing all the gods.

900
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:01,071
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

901
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:06,670
Speaker 0: I think that and I see why she did what she did but I in her situation would have acted very differently.

902
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:16,450
Speaker 1: I think part of the thing was she went to the government right and The government, you know basically tried to dick her over and that you know.

903
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,198
Speaker 1: It's like I would have done the same thing.

904
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:25,056
Speaker 1: But as soon as they dicked me over I also would have been like Now what the fuck am I gonna do?

905
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,663
Speaker 0: I would have sought out the gods and talked to them.

906
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:28,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

907
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:34,530
Speaker 1: I also would have tried to like, you know She had a big problem towards the end of the story with the media not knowing anything.

908
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:40,550
Speaker 1: I would have gone to the media, you know on my own to make sure that the true story was out from the get-go.

909
00:53:40,932 --> 00:53:43,330
Speaker 1: You know make sure that people know what's going on.

910
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:48,227
Speaker 1: Don't do this like all secret like even if it means that the bad guys know where you are.

911
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:48,950
Speaker 1: Who cares?

912
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,719
Speaker 1: They're running from you not the other.

913
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:52,789
Speaker 1: so it's okay if they know where you are.

914
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:56,724
Speaker 1: Right because she obviously if she was able to catch up to them every time.

915
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:57,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess she was just.

916
00:53:58,776 --> 00:54:07,930
Speaker 0: She is a character became Ultraviolet and full of rage and permanent anger pretty rapidly, but that's why her end was also appropriate, right?

917
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:15,710
Speaker 1: It's like she became like this horrible monster of murder to get rid of these people and then or gods and then she was gone.

918
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:16,890
Speaker 1: You know, she didn't stick around.

919
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:19,090
Speaker 0: I feel like I would even if I had killed all the gods.

920
00:54:19,191 --> 00:54:22,789
Speaker 0: I would have kept the sword and become a god myself rather than go through what she went through at the end.

921
00:54:23,111 --> 00:54:27,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the thing may but then eventually it's not gonna work anymore, you know, why not?

922
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:28,811
Speaker 1: I don't know.

923
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:31,942
Speaker 1: I guess you know because look at Demetrius also happen to him.

924
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:33,427
Speaker 1: Demetrius kept the sword and it didn't.

925
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,236
Speaker 0: yeah Because he hit it and he was.

926
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,005
Speaker 0: he could have dealt out with it better.

927
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:44,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe But eventually he just you know after so many years he didn't want to and you know You don't want you anymore kill yourself with it.

928
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:47,309
Speaker 0: Don't just throw it away and then you know go through that.

929
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:51,099
Speaker 0: That last shot of her jaw falling off again was.

930
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,005
Speaker 0: was that that really hit home.

931
00:54:53,587 --> 00:54:54,590
Speaker 1: It's I think that's the point.

932
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:57,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I'm glad they did not show the other parts though.

933
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:02,662
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, do you have anything else to say about this ward?
