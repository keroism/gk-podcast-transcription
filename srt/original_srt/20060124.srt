1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,791
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday January 24th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:16,579
Speaker 1: We talk about the Milton Bradley game master series.

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,500
Speaker 0: Let's do this All right, so you may or may not know that I'm in the market to buy a nice new car.

4
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:28,410
Speaker 1: Any because he drives a beat-up tempo that barely runs.

5
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:29,995
Speaker 0: it barely runs for sure.

6
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,645
Speaker 0: it makes all kinds of noises But it goes.

7
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:39,720
Speaker 0: so it's gonna last me until I get this new car in a few weeks, so Anyway we I'm looking for a hatchback kind of car.

8
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,910
Speaker 0: You know two or four doors, but there's no trunk.

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,194
Speaker 0: the back just kind of opens.

10
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,100
Speaker 1: there aren't so many hatchbacks anymore.

11
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:46,967
Speaker 1: It's like Americans.

12
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,499
Speaker 1: Just don't desire them.

13
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,228
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is that you know.

14
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:55,949
Speaker 0: you'd figure that for every variety of vehicle There would be one per brand you know.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,893
Speaker 0: so for an SUV you can get the Mazda SUV the Ford SUV The Chevy SUV the Tonda SUV.

16
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:07,470
Speaker 0: right everyone makes an SUV But not everyone makes a hatchback.

17
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:21,839
Speaker 0: They're only really good ones to choose from considering the fact that the Honda Civic hatchback is not made now because they're gonna make the Honda fit next year and The Acura hatchback won't be out till next year either.

18
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:27,874
Speaker 0: My only choices are pretty much the Volkswagen GTI and the Mazda 3.

19
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:30,220
Speaker 1: now the Mazda 3 seems to be a clear winner here.

20
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:31,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we went.

21
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:40,119
Speaker 1: we went with our friend Pete I want the scientists from the other day and we were test driving the cars and Pete and I just played Mario Kart DS while Scott was test driving.

22
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:45,817
Speaker 1: and All I have to say about Volkswagen is that the salespeople are kind of creepy at least the one that we went to.

23
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,148
Speaker 0: I mean Let's look at the dealers who went to.

24
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,440
Speaker 0: he went to the Mazda dealer where the guy was just kind of cool.

25
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:56,087
Speaker 0: You know a little bit of salesman action, but you know he wasn't pushing it on me And I you know it's like.

26
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,640
Speaker 0: you know he knew he wasn't a doofus.

27
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,113
Speaker 1: Went to the Chevy dealer where the guy was just like here's the keys.

28
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:01,977
Speaker 1: see you back whenever.

29
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,282
Speaker 0: yep That guy was very hands-off But I think that's because we went in the middle of the rain when it was dark out and late And he didn't care.

30
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,308
Speaker 1: yeah, plus word.

31
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:10,172
Speaker 1: He's like where do you live?

32
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,739
Speaker 1: and we're like we pointed at our house.

33
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, see it from the dealership.

34
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,164
Speaker 0: Yep, and then The Volkswagen dealer.

35
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:18,128
Speaker 0: they were actually like.

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,272
Speaker 0: you know I was like.

37
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,642
Speaker 0: can I drive it because I expected it to be like the other Dealers.

38
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:22,711
Speaker 0: they just gave me the keys and I went.

39
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:26,539
Speaker 0: but no there She was like well come into my little box.

40
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:33,975
Speaker 0: And I went into this little box, and she gave me like this psychological talk German engineered blah blah blah blah blah.

41
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:34,740
Speaker 1: German engineer.

42
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:47,003
Speaker 0: She's like she's like try it when you're in the car try to you know think about how great it is, and I'm like yeah Nice try professor X Cuz.

43
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:51,526
Speaker 0: now I'm just gonna be thinking about how annoying you were instead of The car.

44
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:58,020
Speaker 1: well the one thing we noticed that and Scott pointed it out And I kind of laughed at him, but then we looked online and verified that it's in fact true.

45
00:02:59,564 --> 00:02:59,747
Speaker 1: It was.

46
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:05,815
Speaker 1: it's also a service center It's not just a dealer and there were a large number of cars of the type.

47
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,281
Speaker 1: He was looking to buy being serviced Mm-hmm.

48
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:09,868
Speaker 1: now I wrote that office.

49
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,720
Speaker 1: Oh, this is probably the regional service center, and they send them all here.

50
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,167
Speaker 0: I think it is the regional service center, and they send them all here.

51
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:19,340
Speaker 1: however there are serious problems with the Volkswagen GTI's.

52
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:29,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went around the internet looking at various websites comparing the two cars And you know all kinds of user reviews which are about as reliable as shit You know.

53
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:41,411
Speaker 0: but a couple time I tried to remember things that I saw more than once because you would and I tried to ignore Anything said by someone who sounded like a ricer Because there were people who were like the Mazda 3 sucks.

54
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,295
Speaker 0: You can't modify it.

55
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:43,300
Speaker 0: It's hard to get parts.

56
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:44,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the funniest one is.

57
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:48,860
Speaker 1: someone said they didn't like a car because the subwoofer that came with it wasn't powerful enough.

58
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, you need you need to get out of here.

59
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,020
Speaker 0: But I saw at least two times on the internet that there were rely.

60
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,220
Speaker 0: It's all it said were reliability issues with the Volkswagen GTI.

61
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:04,919
Speaker 0: So then I was like who knows that's not from anything official.

62
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:12,271
Speaker 0: then it was in the supermarket standing around and I picked up this car magazine that had every single car from 2005 and 2006 with stats in a summary.

63
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:19,596
Speaker 1: meanwhile I'm standing outside the supermarket with all my groceries wondering where the hell Scott went.

64
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,702
Speaker 0: I didn't know where you went Cuz.

65
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:25,020
Speaker 0: I had finished shopping and you were still getting milk or some juice or something.

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,366
Speaker 0: I don't know.

67
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:31,400
Speaker 0: and So I was just reading this magazine waiting for you to get in line And then you were already finished getting in line while I was reading.

68
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:35,777
Speaker 0: but anyway, it they'd said right in there Volkswagen GTI reliability issues.

69
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:41,940
Speaker 0: and Another thing is I don't know how many times this lady was like feel those doors.

70
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:47,269
Speaker 0: And I got to admit when you close the doors on this car It's like it feels really solid.

71
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:50,340
Speaker 0: It's like they do it on purpose with like super hinges or something.

72
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:55,780
Speaker 1: Yeah You know why the car is so solid because it weighs like twice as much as any other car that size.

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't needs a giant supercharged engine to actually push it.

74
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:02,340
Speaker 0: They like double steel reinforced the doors.

75
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:04,480
Speaker 0: That's why they're like that which makes it real heavy.

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:14,051
Speaker 0: So it's a supercharged engine and it might I'm not a hundred percent sure but the Volkswagen website said it, you know Should use premium gas and not regular gas which I could see.

77
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:16,520
Speaker 1: that because basically I used to drive a car that had a turbo.

78
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:33,693
Speaker 1: it was a real fast car and Turbo or super in either case generally means high compression and not to get into a long technical discussion of cars But high compression basically the more you compress gasoline the more likely it is to spontaneously Ignite before your spark plug goes.

79
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:34,959
Speaker 1: that's bad.

80
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:40,780
Speaker 1: That causes knocking and if you have knocking basically your engine is one second away from shitting itself.

81
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:48,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna go into all the other details about the difference between this car and the Mazda 3 But I'm probably gonna get the Mazda 3.

82
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:49,617
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call the guy.

83
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:53,840
Speaker 1: probably tomorrow We're gonna try to start a dealer war because there's two Mazda dealers around.

84
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:59,401
Speaker 1: I told Scott he should call one get a price quote call the other one say he's got this price quote ask him if they'll Beat it.

85
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:13,260
Speaker 0: I do realize I just found a disadvantage in the dealer war though because one dealers in New York I just noticed in the little Mazda book, you know the brochure thing Yeah, that the Mazda 3 is sold in New York are somehow different from the one sold in Connecticut.

86
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,845
Speaker 0: They have seven less horsepower.

87
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:15,708
Speaker 0: Why?

88
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:22,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, it said 153 horsepower in California, New York Massachusetts Maine and somewhere else.

89
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,420
Speaker 0: so I kind of want to get it in Connecticut.

90
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:25,246
Speaker 1: Well, wait a minute.

91
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,363
Speaker 1: There's probably more to it than that I know.

92
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:32,089
Speaker 0: that's why I'm gonna ask the guy when I call him It might be an emissions thing.

93
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,494
Speaker 1: It might be a thing.

94
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,220
Speaker 1: It might just be that's kind of weird.

95
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:41,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to find out exactly what that is because who knows maybe if I buy in Connecticut bring it to New York I'll have to pay to have something done to it.

96
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I mean Dutchess County where we live There aren't emissions tests.

97
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 1: I mean we have car inspections, which honestly I used to live in, Michigan.

98
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:58,655
Speaker 0: So the idea of the fact that I had to get my car inspected was an alien thing to me as long as it passed Inspection which I think it's kind of hard for a brand new car to fail inspection.

99
00:06:58,715 --> 00:06:58,896
Speaker 1: Yep.

100
00:06:59,117 --> 00:06:59,920
Speaker 0: I'm alright.

101
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:02,518
Speaker 1: So the thing is we don't have emissions testing here yet.

102
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:06,196
Speaker 1: Nope, and every year the legislature is like we're gonna do it.

103
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:16,965
Speaker 1: We're gonna do it We're gonna do it and everyone's kind of all the car people around here always yelling about it Yeah, but I could see you get in the car in Connecticut and then we have emissions testing and it doesn't pass some silly New York rule we don't know about.

104
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:20,200
Speaker 0: well, Connecticut had emissions testing for as long as I can remember.

105
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:24,377
Speaker 0: You know probably in my lifetime it started but I don't remember it because I wasn't paying attention.

106
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:37,931
Speaker 0: I was a little kid but Then there was an issue when I left for college that the emissions testing people which was a private company Which is contracted by the state government Was all corrupt and the emissions testing was just this big sham.

107
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:39,095
Speaker 1: Haha.

108
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:40,640
Speaker 1: I'm scamming your emissions.

109
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:47,040
Speaker 0: Yes, so they closed emissions and you didn't need emissions for in Connecticut for a few years and then it started up again.

110
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,969
Speaker 0: I don't know if it started up again now or it's sooner.

111
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,972
Speaker 0: Who knows.

112
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:51,694
Speaker 0: It's a big mess.

113
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,360
Speaker 0: Yeah governor went to jail.

114
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:57,620
Speaker 0: God, who knows he went over to jail over something else though that shows you how great he was.

115
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:04,519
Speaker 1: See it was weird in Michigan because they had an emissions laws that your car couldn't emit certain things But there were no inspections or anything.

116
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:10,100
Speaker 1: So basically the only way you get caught is if a state trooper saw smoke coming out of your car and pulled you over.

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if someone can see smoke coming out of your car It's usually because you're burning oil not because your emissions are too high.

118
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,633
Speaker 0: if your emissions are too high It'll just smell real bad driving behind you.

119
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:25,356
Speaker 1: You won't actually see anything Yeah, and actually that bad smell usually just means you're running too rich and you get there.

120
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:26,620
Speaker 1: We're not gonna get into that.

121
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:29,293
Speaker 0: Cars nevermind, we're done with the cars.

122
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:29,715
Speaker 1: Yeah.

123
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:30,197
Speaker 0: All right.

124
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,164
Speaker 0: So What's in the news today?

125
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:33,589
Speaker 0: Oh the MPAA?

126
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,580
Speaker 1: Yeah the MPAA and you know, we all love them.

127
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,440
Speaker 1: They're just bastions of honor and righteousness and they're really fighting for the little guy.

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,993
Speaker 0: Well, I got to say one thing though in the MPAA's favor.

129
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:50,043
Speaker 0: They're not as bad as the RIAA That's you know what.

130
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:53,392
Speaker 1: yeah Mussolini was an ass, but he wasn't quite Hitler.

131
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:54,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, not quite.

132
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:58,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, not quite, you know now Wasn't quite Stalin?

133
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:03,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the MPAA Basically a bunt.

134
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,176
Speaker 1: someone did a documentary film about them and about their business practices called.

135
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:09,380
Speaker 1: this film is not yet rated.

136
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:19,423
Speaker 0: Well it talks mostly about the rating system and how the ten the group of people who do the ratings don't have to reveal themselves and how they're like biased against.

137
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:26,986
Speaker 0: you know certain movies as opposed to others and they give certain movies a worse rating when they don't really deserve it and It's not objective and it's all bullshit.

138
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:27,408
Speaker 1: Now.

139
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:30,499
Speaker 1: It's a good movie and it's worth watching especially if you don't like the MPAA.

140
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:32,139
Speaker 1: This is just more fuel on the fire.

141
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:38,712
Speaker 0: Yeah And if you do like the MPAA or you think the rating system is good This will either piss you off or work to change.

142
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:43,991
Speaker 1: Wait, wait now if you if you like the MPAA I'm not saying if you don't know they're bad, but if you actively like what they're doing.

143
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,396
Speaker 1: stop listening to my show.

144
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:52,547
Speaker 1: Yeah But basically They got a copy of the film.

145
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:55,936
Speaker 1: this film is not yet rated to rate among other things.

146
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:00,880
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and They made copies of it to distribute to a bunch of their employees.

147
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:02,043
Speaker 0: Yep.

148
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:09,539
Speaker 1: Now, I don't know about you but as far as I know it's illegal to do that without the permission of the copyright owner.

149
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,500
Speaker 1: and This copyright isn't owned by the MPAA.

150
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:23,740
Speaker 1: It's owned by the people who did the documentary who in fact told the MPAA specifically, please don't copy this Mm-hmm, even better and no one's sure yet, but they might have actually given it to him on a DVD.

151
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:34,432
Speaker 1: Mmm, if that's the case, not only did the MPAA break copyright law and break a contract But they violated the DMCA the law they got.

152
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:37,645
Speaker 1: they got passed on their own that the law They're trying to use to fuck all of us.

153
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:40,618
Speaker 0: now at least the MPAA kind of admitted it.

154
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,800
Speaker 0: they said yeah Okay, we we pirated the movie.

155
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,560
Speaker 0: We're gonna destroy and give you back all the copies and we'll make it right.

156
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:53,775
Speaker 0: But if I was the people who made this movie I Would stick them to the wall with very large pointy bits.

157
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:54,899
Speaker 1: now, you know, what's great?

158
00:10:55,745 --> 00:11:02,600
Speaker 1: No one's sure exactly how this is gonna play out yet But there's been a lot of talk that the people who made the movie are going to take them to court.

159
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:03,563
Speaker 0: Awesome.

160
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,912
Speaker 1: I will will if that actually happens.

161
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:07,317
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it more see now.

162
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,020
Speaker 0: Here's the thing though.

163
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,800
Speaker 0: It's like if they win then that gives grounds for the MPAA to do things to other people the same way and they'll win.

164
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:23,859
Speaker 0: But if they lose then it means, you know, they lost which sucks But at the same time it means the MPAA can't win if they try it on someone else.

165
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:30,531
Speaker 1: Yep, because if the MPAA gets you you could just say hey, hey, hey Fine, I'll get rid of all the copies I have.

166
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,398
Speaker 1: and yeah, yeah.

167
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:39,195
Speaker 1: so someone finally had the Testicular fortitude to make us some audio feedback.

168
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:46,147
Speaker 0: Holy crap Yeah, so of course you send it to us in a WMA file Yeah, which don't worry.

169
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,760
Speaker 1: We discovered a way to turn that into a wave file in Linux.

170
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,168
Speaker 1: But just the heads up to all you out there.

171
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:50,973
Speaker 1: We don't run windows.

172
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:56,239
Speaker 0: Yeah waves MP3s and odds that's that's pretty much what we deal with in terms of audio.

173
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:02,840
Speaker 1: Actually, I've been running a file of WMA a lot because we're looking for a little solid-state device to record for.

174
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:09,680
Speaker 1: When we go to conventions when they're interviewing people We don't want to lug a PC around or fiddle with resound while we're recording a bunch of stuff.

175
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:16,810
Speaker 1: We just want a little recording thing and all the ones that are nice and cheap Record natively to crappy crappy crappy WMA files.

176
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:30,020
Speaker 1: and although I know why all the ones that record nicely are Much more money than I'm willing to spend on a solid-state recorder I think we should just get use this laptop or maybe get an external hard drive for this laptop.

177
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:37,469
Speaker 1: I get a new laptop or I'm trolling around eBay for an old DAT recorder Because DAT for that's really good.

178
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,556
Speaker 1: Yeah, DAT is basically get tapes though.

179
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:40,982
Speaker 1: Oh, that's fine I can get them.

180
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:48,586
Speaker 1: basically for anyone who doesn't know about digital audio and everything DAT is the original Useful digital audio format.

181
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:56,988
Speaker 1: it came out a long time ago, and it's pretty much been the industry standard in terms of you know recording something authoritatively and definitively and pretty

182
00:12:57,008 --> 00:13:07,180
Speaker 0: much tons of radio stations used it instead of vinyl and Japanese radio stations I think still use it and I'm Japanese people used to use it instead of cassette tapes because it's like a thousand times better.

183
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:13,116
Speaker 0: But now the American Record industry didn't want us having perfect digital copies of music.

184
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,443
Speaker 1: So we didn't get that yeah, in fact DAT unless you.

185
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:26,665
Speaker 1: basically they segregated that into two classes of players and recorders in the US and They made the ones that could record more than some piddly amount Outrageously expensive.

186
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:30,420
Speaker 1: to make sure that no normal people could get their hands on good digital audio.

187
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just artificially inflated the prices so that you know Real music.

188
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:38,860
Speaker 0: people had to pay a lot and normal people didn't have access.

189
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:44,757
Speaker 0: That's kind of why they're screwed now is because now everyone has access to perfect digital recording with the computer.

190
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:45,659
Speaker 0: Hence this show.

191
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,400
Speaker 1: Yep, so we'll see if I can find a little DAT device.

192
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:59,555
Speaker 1: So anyway, Eric for those of you who might not remember is the person who's listening to the podcast on Sony PSP and he sent us nice little audio on how he did it.

193
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:00,800
Speaker 1: now you can do it.

194
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:02,339
Speaker 0: Let's listen.

195
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,992
Speaker 2: Hey Raymond Scott, this is Eric glimpse and tonight.

196
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,000
Speaker 2: I'm going to tell you how to set up your PSP.

197
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,858
Speaker 2: So it's an RSS reader.

198
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:18,599
Speaker 2: now first of all you need to make sure you have a PSP and not a Nintendo DS because obviously those things can't do what the PSP can do.

199
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:25,371
Speaker 2: and next I'd like you to check if you have a wireless connection and It needs to be hooked up to the internet so you can do this.

200
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:30,140
Speaker 2: so you can update your PSP to 2.6 firmware if you haven't already.

201
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:35,606
Speaker 2: Now first of all, you need to go to Download the PSP firmware.

202
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,100
Speaker 2: You first need to go to your settings icon on the left side of the screen.

203
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:53,028
Speaker 2: then you need to move up and click network update and then you can just follow the on-screen on-screen instructions and those will tell you how to do everything and You can just download that and it won't take very long.

204
00:14:53,048 --> 00:15:08,643
Speaker 2: and As soon as you're done with that you need to go in and install your PSP 2.6 firmware on your PSP and If you don't have enough battery when it's done downloading It'll tell you to charge your battery and the reason it does that.

205
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:13,771
Speaker 2: first of all because it's like, you know your PC when you update your BIOS is Like.

206
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,670
Speaker 2: if you don't do that, then you're you know, your your BIOS chip will go out.

207
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,417
Speaker 2: So it just applies the same way to PSP and you can go in and update that.

208
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:22,957
Speaker 1: So

209
00:15:23,558 --> 00:16:04,290
Speaker 2: first you need to charge your battery and Then you go to the game icon on the right side of the screen and then you move down and you go to memory stick click that and then choose PSP firmware 2.6 and then once again go with the on-screen instructions and Install that on your PSP and after that your PSP will reset and then you can go in to the left side of the screen or the right side of the screen again and go to the network icon once again and then go up to internet browser and then on that choose the button file and then you can type in the address like if you want to go to.

210
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:05,616
Speaker 2: Lets you do this.

211
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:17,969
Speaker 2: For example, go to podcast.yahoo.com then click enter and Then that page will open and this is specifically to get geek nights on your PSP And then go to

212
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:19,012
Speaker 1: That

213
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:24,636
Speaker 2: text box with tagline beside it and then right in there type in geek nights and I think I've tried geek before.

214
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:42,524
Speaker 2: maybe it came up, but just try geek nights just to make sure and Then geek nights will show up as number one and you can go besides that and click the name And there's a link right there and then it'll send you to this page and it'll have like these two big buttons when you get there for Subscribe or download the podcast.

215
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:51,450
Speaker 2: but don't go to that whatever you do But on the like the right side of the page right besides the words RSS colon you'll have a link.

216
00:16:52,332 --> 00:17:02,830
Speaker 2: It'll be in like XML or whatever and just click that and that will tell you to Subscribe to the download or subscribe to the podcast and you can do that.

217
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:14,450
Speaker 2: and so then when you want to leave the web browser just press circle and then select yes from that message box and now you're ready to go in and Listen to the podcast.

218
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:27,990
Speaker 2: so now that you're on the main menu again go to the network icon once again, then go to RSS channel and There you can select the podcast you want to listen to and you can stream it from the internet.

219
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:32,535
Speaker 2: so that's basically how to do that and You can just prove how smart you are.

220
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:40,989
Speaker 2: And also I heard that with the new updates you can actually listen to Or watch streaming video.

221
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:45,690
Speaker 2: So see that's gonna be a new update pretty soon and that's gonna be really cool.

222
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,310
Speaker 2: I can't wait for that and maybe we can get all like a game spot video streams from there.

223
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:52,597
Speaker 2: So that'll be pretty cool.

224
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,381
Speaker 2: Now.

225
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,029
Speaker 2: I also have another question for you guys.

226
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:58,490
Speaker 2: You guys remember the fear game that came out?

227
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,530
Speaker 2: I know you talked about that like when you were talking about how PC games were dying.

228
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:06,030
Speaker 2: So maybe you guys could talk to us about that.

229
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,970
Speaker 2: That'd be pretty cool because that was a really awesome game and I don't think it got enough credit for all the innovation it had.

230
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:13,242
Speaker 2: So thanks guys.

231
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:13,950
Speaker 2: Talk to you later.

232
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:20,111
Speaker 1: Well and first I just like to say that Eric did put some nice music at the beginning and end of that and no offense We only.

233
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,052
Speaker 1: it was real done.

234
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:24,797
Speaker 1: We only took it out because one we were very mindful of copyright here.

235
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,600
Speaker 1: Yeah nights and two.

236
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:28,835
Speaker 1: Now there's.

237
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,530
Speaker 0: no I don't really want to get sued by a CDC.

238
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:35,241
Speaker 0: So the first thing The DS.

239
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:49,138
Speaker 0: I don't see any Technological reason why the DS can't listen to podcasts other than not having any place to store them While you're listening, but you know if someone made like a little flash cart for the GBA slot or something You know it.

240
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,370
Speaker 0: it can go on the internet.

241
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:52,519
Speaker 0: We just need someone to write the software to do it.

242
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,330
Speaker 0: People have already written DS software to go war driving.

243
00:18:55,872 --> 00:19:03,535
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean and honestly I think within some amount of time there's gonna be an official sort of web browser Something for the DS.

244
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:07,370
Speaker 0: yeah Reggie someone asked Reggie about it once and he was kind of like it could happen.

245
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:12,070
Speaker 0: He didn't say he was gonna do it or Nintendo was gonna do it, but he said there's no reason why not.

246
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,387
Speaker 1: Yep, because I mean the PSP seems to do this really well like from.

247
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,949
Speaker 1: from what you said It looks like it's really simple to update it and get online and all that.

248
00:19:19,673 --> 00:19:25,741
Speaker 1: But I just got to point out that the DS has a freaking stylus Which is like plus 10 in my book for browsing the interwebs.

249
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:30,778
Speaker 0: Yeah when you were talking about like hitting circle Oh god that brought back flashbacks.

250
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,764
Speaker 1: Yes, we've actually we.

251
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:38,817
Speaker 1: I bought a Sony PlayStation a ps1 for a hundred dollars Solely to play dance dance revolution.

252
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:42,630
Speaker 0: playing dance dance revolution doesn't teach you circle square triangle X.

253
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,383
Speaker 1: so a bunch of our friends got the Naruto fighting game and Those are ps2 game.

254
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,760
Speaker 1: I think yeah It was ps2 and we went over there to play it.

255
00:19:51,342 --> 00:20:03,868
Speaker 1: and one of the things in the game is whenever a combo starts It'll show you a sequence of like Triangle XX circle real fast and you have to hit him and We freaking didn't know which button was where and we couldn't do it fast enough, and we just got creamed.

256
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:06,836
Speaker 0: yeah I guess that sucks for us.

257
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were definitely only fluent in Nintendo.

258
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, a B C like Sesame Street.

259
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,990
Speaker 1: Yo well a B X Y C was definitely Sega Genesis.

260
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,622
Speaker 0: Well C is also on the n64 gamecube.

261
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,123
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

262
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:22,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I didn't really play the n64 much.

263
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,105
Speaker 1: I kind of skipped a generation of consoles there.

264
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,282
Speaker 0: hmm Anyway, but it seems like the PSP firmware is pretty awesome.

265
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:30,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really updating.

266
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:31,410
Speaker 0: it is pretty awesome.

267
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,080
Speaker 1: I really like the fact that it has a nice little idiot proof.

268
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,505
Speaker 1: Hey the battery is low.

269
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:36,730
Speaker 1: plug me in or something.

270
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,655
Speaker 1: Otherwise you're boned.

271
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if you try to update my firmware my battery runs out I'm gonna.

272
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,361
Speaker 0: you're basically gonna brick me.

273
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:47,450
Speaker 1: cuz I mean computers I. I can see that if you're gonna flash your BIOS you know about that anyway.

274
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:56,590
Speaker 1: But I really don't expect everyone who owns a PSP to Understand the concept of a BIOS or a CMOS because that is kind of esoteric knowledge.

275
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:58,890
Speaker 0: I'll admit that and you know what I got to admit.

276
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:06,055
Speaker 0: It sounds like the firmware in the PSP is actually a lot more awesome than what's in the D The iPod now the DS.

277
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,843
Speaker 0: yeah the iPod cuz pretty much the iPod.

278
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:10,889
Speaker 0: it all this stuff is in iTunes.

279
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,721
Speaker 0: You need to plug the iPod in to get it to sync up.

280
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:21,810
Speaker 0: the PSP seems like it has iTunes equivalent in it Which is really what I think the iPod should be because it's really annoying to have it tethered to my computer.

281
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:28,250
Speaker 0: I wish I could just you know Subscribe and unsubscribe from podcasts on the iPod and it would just download them wirelessly.

282
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,169
Speaker 0: That's what I really want and it sounds like the PSP can do that.

283
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:37,628
Speaker 0: But I'd get it except for the fact that it's really expensive and really big and the battery life isn't long.

284
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:43,109
Speaker 0: and yeah I have a nano so you can see it's quite a size upgrade there.

285
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:47,350
Speaker 0: No, and the the last thing is you wanted us to talk about the fear game.

286
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:55,726
Speaker 0: Actually, I know about the game and I've heard people talk about it and they know of its existence and what type of game it Is but I never played it.

287
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:06,430
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna download the single-player demo and I'll get back to you Yep, and I was actually poking around just looking at it and it actually looks like it's probably a pretty cool game.

288
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:12,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like some combination of like a Resident Evil Silent Hill type of scariness with some FPS action.

289
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,630
Speaker 1: Because I mean, I guess when it comes to PC games I don't think we're not really trying to say that it's dead as in there's nothing good out there.

290
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:29,689
Speaker 1: I think it's more of a. it's dead and that it's lost the hearts and minds of gamers and That there aren't many gamers out there who seem to delve into the PC realm to find the gems anymore

291
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:31,356
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

292
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,610
Speaker 1: and I got to admit gems are increasingly hard to find but this game might be a gem.

293
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:35,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

294
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:48,443
Speaker 0: but it is basically because the Xbox taking away a lot of Genres that used to not be playable on the console and MMO is basically dominating the entire platform of PC.

295
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:58,373
Speaker 0: There just aren't that many PC games worth playing anymore, so it becomes less and less intelligent to buy a crazy gaming PC Of course.

296
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:02,448
Speaker 1: luckily it seems that as time goes on all you can play almost every good game on a crap.

297
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:03,855
Speaker 1: OPC Mm-hmm.

298
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,502
Speaker 1: I was playing Civ 2 today and loving it.

299
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:14,489
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, honestly I'm kind of thinking upgrade my computer just because I do want to play Civ 4 and half-life 2 and I don't need to play them perfectly.

300
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:17,766
Speaker 0: I kind of want to play Civ 4 but I don't really want to pay for it without playing.

301
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:18,952
Speaker 0: maybe there's a demo of that Too.

302
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,001
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, check it out.

303
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:20,747
Speaker 0: I should go for that.

304
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:35,440
Speaker 0: Yeah So at MIT, they got this crazy crazy awesome digital painting machine thing.

305
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:46,439
Speaker 0: you know you've seen stuff like this before where someone takes a camera and they pointed at something and the camera figures out what color It is and then maybe like lights up a light in the same color or something like that.

306
00:23:47,342 --> 00:24:00,553
Speaker 0: well, what they got is they have this paintbrush for the camera in it and you pointed at something and then you go over to this special screen and you paint on it with the brush and It paints using whatever the camera took a picture of.

307
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:11,378
Speaker 0: so if I pointed it at I don't know a piece of green construction paper I could basically paint on the screen with the texture and color of green construction paper.

308
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,124
Speaker 1: now It's much more than that.

309
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:14,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cool.

310
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:15,172
Speaker 0: This is the now see.

311
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:25,540
Speaker 0: that was just a normal leap of logic Like something like oh I could have figured, you know, I could have thought of that But that's that's a pretty interesting use of existing understood technologies, you know, and it's cool.

312
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:27,875
Speaker 0: They made it video.

313
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:34,260
Speaker 0: So This means you could but the example they use is they pointed at someone's eyeball and the person blinks, right?

314
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,619
Speaker 0: And then they paint on the screen and you get a bunch of eyeballs.

315
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,718
Speaker 0: blinking eyeballs.

316
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:41,992
Speaker 0: It's really cool.

317
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:46,639
Speaker 0: Yeah Just just watch the video and you will comprehend and be amazed.

318
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:51,719
Speaker 1: Yep, so a lot of you probably remember those magic eyes that were really popular in the mid 90s.

319
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,920
Speaker 1: Well, you stand there and you unfocus your eyes and then a three-dimensional image appears.

320
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,840
Speaker 0: I always used to put my face up next to it and then pull away from it like the instruction said.

321
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the technique I saw.

322
00:25:02,205 --> 00:25:10,479
Speaker 1: but basically I learned early on that there's two ways to do them And for the longest time I always saw those things backwards because I cross my eyes instead of unfocusing them.

323
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:18,738
Speaker 1: Basically either move the eyes together move the eyes apart But luckily my thing of the day caters to both types of people and if you can do both well kudos to you.

324
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:27,895
Speaker 1: But basically they use the same concept and they made an entire Stereoscopic animation of a little girl in Japan trying to take pictures of cats with herself.

325
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:32,340
Speaker 1: I am cell phone cam We and it's just really cute cool.

326
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:35,879
Speaker 1: Just cross your eyes or unfocus them or do whatever you need to do to see the 3d image.

327
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:42,580
Speaker 1: If you're not familiar with how to do it, just google around for stereoscopic images and you'll find instructions.

328
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:44,360
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go into detail about that here.

329
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,479
Speaker 0: It actually been a while since I'd done it so it's kind of hard for me.

330
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,155
Speaker 0: But basically what I did is I crossed my.

331
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:50,980
Speaker 0: there are two pictures.

332
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:58,679
Speaker 0: So I crossed my eyes until of course then there would be four pictures and I lined up two of them on top of each Other to make three but it was all blurry.

333
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:10,900
Speaker 0: So what I had to do is I had to line it up so that there were three and then like I don't know How to explain it, but I did something to my eyes to hold the crossings that remain three images while also focusing.

334
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:12,706
Speaker 1: He had a lot of trouble with this.

335
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:14,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, he just eventually got it.

336
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:17,944
Speaker 0: It was a two-step thing cross Lock focus.

337
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:21,600
Speaker 1: now the cool thing is back in the day and I should see if I can find it again.

338
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:34,527
Speaker 1: I remember someone made a mod or a thing for quake one Where you could quake one would display on two little windows and you could do the same thing and play quake one in real 3d Mmm, it was really cool.

339
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,920
Speaker 1: But you couldn't play it for more than about 15 minutes without getting a headache.

340
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,173
Speaker 0: Yeah I noticed I had a real problem with it because I had to.

341
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:48,099
Speaker 0: I had to keep my eyes open Basically to do it and then eventually to blink and half the time when I blinked I totally lost it.

342
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus if you do it too often, you might get your eyes a little bit out of sync.

343
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:55,051
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe that's why I had a hard time doing it because my eyes are so good.

344
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:57,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure.

345
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:03,200
Speaker 1: And in fact, uh, some video cards have drivers in them where they'll do stereoscopic things.

346
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:09,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if Windows Vista locks out drivers, oh You won't be able to use your cause.

347
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,500
Speaker 0: some stereoscopic driver mods.

348
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:28,200
Speaker 1: So today since over the weekend we played an old game that we really hadn't touched since we were in school We Decided that we're gonna talk about the Milton Bradley Game Master series and all the games in it since the game we played obviously is in that series.

349
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:32,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was in fact the last and as many would argue the greatest of this series.

350
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:32,838
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

351
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:40,580
Speaker 1: Now the game is called Shogun though It hasn't been marketed under the name Shogun for quite some time and you might hear it as samurai swords.

352
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:43,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you see you might see in a store somewhere.

353
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:44,580
Speaker 0: if you're lucky, I don't know if they still make it.

354
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,905
Speaker 0: I don't think so, but it'll say samurai swords Previously named Shogun.

355
00:27:49,587 --> 00:28:02,199
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically the four games in the series and you might have heard of some of these or five games axis and allies conquest of the Empire broadsides and boarding parties fortress America and of course Shogun Shogun.

356
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:10,614
Speaker 0: basically what this was is When we were little kids, we didn't have awesome German games like are available today.

357
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:16,959
Speaker 0: And these are the most strategic Games that you could buy in Toys R Us.

358
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, these aren't life.

359
00:28:18,243 --> 00:28:20,511
Speaker 1: You don't just roll a spinner and see who wins.

360
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:24,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, it's They're.

361
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:29,972
Speaker 0: they're very American games, but they're also very good games and they're pretty much they well.

362
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:37,320
Speaker 0: until Recently, they were the only really good American board games that were available to American children.

363
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:41,535
Speaker 1: The one thing they all have in common is that the rules are horridly written.

364
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:47,200
Speaker 1: I could cry And I mean, I remember when I was a kid always having trouble with the rules nexus and allies.

365
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:54,238
Speaker 1: We never really played it the same way twice Yeah, and it wasn't until this weekend that we actually learned the proper rules of Shogun.

366
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:55,764
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And they were actually.

367
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:57,332
Speaker 0: we messed up one thing.

368
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:58,699
Speaker 1: Well Scott messed up.

369
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,223
Speaker 0: Yeah But messing up one thing.

370
00:29:00,304 --> 00:29:10,857
Speaker 1: I consider that to be great that we got everything right except one thing because a German game They they write the rules in this way where you know that if they say the word may it means may.

371
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:13,123
Speaker 1: if they say the word Well, it means will.

372
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:23,140
Speaker 1: it's very specific exact logical phrasing and if something's omitted it means you can't do it Yep, and even when it's translated to English, it's still perfect.

373
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:26,911
Speaker 0: I think that might also be partially because the translators do such a good job.

374
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:29,900
Speaker 1: Yep, but these games are written in the American style.

375
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:38,172
Speaker 1: so the the rules are just kind of meandering and they touch on all the points back and forth and they Assume that you'll just assume things and a lot of.

376
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:43,655
Speaker 0: sometimes the rules are like only really Explained by reading the examples and I just skip the examples.

377
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:47,274
Speaker 0: cuz I don't need them Cuz I expect everything to be in just the rules.

378
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:53,671
Speaker 0: It's kind of annoying Yeah, but another thing these games have in common Which is why they were so popular and we liked them so much.

379
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:55,800
Speaker 0: is they come in real big boxes?

380
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,800
Speaker 0: Like, you know the size were pretty much a normal monopoly box and there's a deluxe monopoly box three times as thick wider and longer.

381
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine a deluxe monopoly box with like on top of itself.

382
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:08,500
Speaker 0: So it's double.

383
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:09,684
Speaker 0: That's what this is like.

384
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:11,631
Speaker 1: and they come with lots of stuff.

385
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:14,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, lots of fun little pieces and stuff.

386
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:25,031
Speaker 0: I mean you think risk comes a lot of guys freaking X's and allies comes with like little tank little tanks little airplane Bombers aircraft carriers shogun comes with a ninja.

387
00:30:25,092 --> 00:30:28,100
Speaker 1: the aircraft carriers are big enough that you can put the planes on them.

388
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

389
00:30:29,224 --> 00:30:35,920
Speaker 0: it's just really cool to play with all little pieces and you know It's not like a crazy war game with the hexes and the little cardboard bits.

390
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:40,437
Speaker 0: But it's a lot more fun, especially when you're little and you're not a super hardcore guy.

391
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,330
Speaker 1: now We've only actually played three of these games.

392
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,179
Speaker 1: So we're just gonna talk about all of them as best we can.

393
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:56,278
Speaker 1: So the first one to be released and perhaps the most popular is axis and allies Which I used to play a lot when I was a kid with my dad my little brother And we had a lot of fun.

394
00:30:56,761 --> 00:31:03,299
Speaker 1: But now then I got older and I played it once with a bunch of friends at college and I learned that the game is Fundamentally broken.

395
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:05,925
Speaker 0: It's not quite perfect.

396
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,153
Speaker 0: It can be fun, but it's not something you can play very.

397
00:31:09,294 --> 00:31:11,700
Speaker 1: the Allies can't lose unless they're retarded.

398
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:17,220
Speaker 1: Basically, unless they're functionally retarded and illiterate the Allies cannot lose.

399
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:21,075
Speaker 1: America just builds up a giant army and then marches its way over to Europe.

400
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:27,740
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It just takes a while, you know, if if they're dumb, they don't get that army across the Atlantic Ocean fast enough.

401
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:33,280
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of America's troops and troop building capacities in America.

402
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:44,159
Speaker 0: yeah, so it all depends on if the person being America and controlling America is knowledgeable enough about how the game works to move those guys across the ocean to get them to Germany as quick as possible.

403
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:47,297
Speaker 0: because Germany does start out with a big pile of guys.

404
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:55,280
Speaker 0: and You know and I'm sure on board game geek if we looked it up There are people who have modified these starting positions and such of the game to make it more even.

405
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,539
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, people have made rules mods that make the game a fairly good game.

406
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:02,307
Speaker 0: Basically, the way it works is it's well axis and allies.

407
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:25,360
Speaker 0: It's what Britain Russia and US versus Germany and Japan Japan and you have this nice little European map and everyone has a. there's a default starting position and you put all your little units out on the board and you can develop technologies and You can buy units and you can move units and fight them and all kinds of fun stuff.

408
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no diplomacy.

409
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:31,480
Speaker 1: Germany can't surrender or ally with Russia to take over the world on their own or anything like that.

410
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,584
Speaker 0: That would be wicked cool.

411
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:34,973
Speaker 0: Of course, then people just do that every time.

412
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:35,656
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:48,837
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean basically the game is real fun Unless you're playing with people who all know the game fairly well because then everyone knows exactly what to do And the game is just deterministic and the Allies win in the end.

414
00:32:48,857 --> 00:33:00,160
Speaker 0: Yep but you know, it's fun to play with little pieces and You know, especially if you know, not everyone knows how to play then, you know, it feels like you're playing something.

415
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:09,275
Speaker 1: Of course, it is hard to follow the rules because they're written kind of weirdly and to this day I'm not a hundred percent clear on the movement rules for ships.

416
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:13,019
Speaker 1: Yeah They're very ambiguous to say the least.

417
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:18,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, and not to mention, you know all the the things of the technology can sometimes get confusing.

418
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:22,280
Speaker 0: You know when they affect how you shoot and move and all that business.

419
00:33:23,322 --> 00:33:28,505
Speaker 1: See, I mean once the strategy I always use is I usually agreed to play Russia or something Just because no one would.

420
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:30,695
Speaker 1: my little brother wouldn't play with me if I was Germany.

421
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:38,919
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm So I'd always be Russia, you know They're basically the crap in this game and my strategy was to do nothing but build infantry every round no matter what?

422
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,260
Speaker 1: Good straight never attack anyone.

423
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:50,099
Speaker 1: I just sit there and build infantry and if he didn't wipe me out Just march its way across Europe.

424
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:54,590
Speaker 0: sweet Yes, that's how good this game can be.

425
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:56,019
Speaker 0: fun as you can do stuff like that.

426
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if everyone knows what they're doing that doesn't work.

427
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:06,120
Speaker 1: and then I have to use the actual Russia strategy Which is attack on the first round attack constantly no matter how many troops you lose from the very beginning of the game.

428
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,543
Speaker 0: That's right.

429
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:09,199
Speaker 0: One of the modifications is Russia can't attack on the first round.

430
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, you pretty much have to implement that to give the axis any chance.

431
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, because if you know what you're doing with Russia, you just attack immediately.

432
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,763
Speaker 1: You lose almost your whole army, but Germany spends so much effort stopping you that Britain just jumps over and that's the end Yep.

433
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:21,891
Speaker 0: All right.

434
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:25,668
Speaker 0: The next game is Conquest of the Empire which we've never played.

435
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:26,712
Speaker 0: we've never played at all.

436
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:28,760
Speaker 0: I've seen it, but I've never played it.

437
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:40,514
Speaker 0: It comes in the same size box and it seems to have a lot more fun pieces than the other games Catapults and roads and little hellas like Greek Roman guys little legionnaires.

438
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:40,995
Speaker 0: They're Romans.

439
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:54,833
Speaker 0: I think the legionnaires They're Greco Romans It seemed as I think there's some road building and some ooh, there's a little What's it called a Roman building with little pillars in the front?

440
00:34:55,558 --> 00:35:02,320
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it looks pretty fun But according to this the rules are kind of also shady.

441
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:07,340
Speaker 1: The game is pretty much completely broken and it's all that matters is whoever has the most catapults wins.

442
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:19,963
Speaker 0: It seems though like there's some sort of Mechanic of generals leading armies and you can do cool stuff like try to extort generals or kid Someone else's general.

443
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:28,751
Speaker 1: you can just say like give me something or I'll execute your general or I'll exile him or I'll Jump them into my army or something.

444
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:30,220
Speaker 1: It looks like they can do a lot of cool stuff.

445
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,960
Speaker 0: Yes So if you can I'm sure there's a way to fix the catapult brokenness and then this could be a really cool game.

446
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:46,460
Speaker 1: But I also saw that you have generals and then you have your Caesar Which is you personally and you can personally lead your army into battle, but like the game says you'd better not lose.

447
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:56,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think generally that's a strategy for when your generals are fucked and you you think you know Oh this I can definitely go save him if the Caesar goes out with an army that sort of thing.

448
00:35:57,643 --> 00:36:02,989
Speaker 0: But I'm sure as soon as anyone takes their Caesar out of a safe place Everyone else in the game tries to go kill it.

449
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:04,115
Speaker 0: It's like up there.

450
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:04,296
Speaker 0: He is.

451
00:36:04,316 --> 00:36:04,738
Speaker 0: Let's go get him.

452
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:12,314
Speaker 0: and anyway The next game is one that I kind of want to like even though I never played.

453
00:36:12,354 --> 00:36:14,300
Speaker 0: it called broadsides and boarding parties.

454
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,609
Speaker 1: Everything I've read says that it's terrible.

455
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:19,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, like terrible terrible terrible not worth playing.

456
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:23,493
Speaker 0: I want to like it cuz it's pirates and I like pirates.

457
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, we seem to like pirates a lot around the here.

458
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:31,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are plenty of pirate games and one day I'm gonna find a pirate game worth playing but this isn't one of them.

459
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:38,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, we don't know much about the mechanics But everyone says that it's just kind of chance who wins and it's two-player.

460
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:39,100
Speaker 1: It's just a duel.

461
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:50,280
Speaker 0: yeah, it's essentially a duel between two ships like a Spanish ship and a pirate ship and They fight each other and the pirates might win in the Spanish guy might win.

462
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:51,642
Speaker 0: It's.

463
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:55,080
Speaker 0: it's just kind of random and there's barely any strategy to it.

464
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:06,720
Speaker 1: Well, we've seen that generally it's very difficult to make good two-player board games because a lot of the randomness in games Ruins them if there's too much of it because then the randomness matters more than your skill.

465
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might.

466
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:13,004
Speaker 0: you're basically just putting a big fancy theme on tossing a coin If it's randomness.

467
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:18,774
Speaker 1: if you have a game that doesn't have randomness the game is very deterministic and it'll play out the exact same way every time.

468
00:37:19,524 --> 00:37:21,279
Speaker 1: So many games that are good.

469
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:33,008
Speaker 1: They don't have much randomness in terms of what you get but you play with three other people and then the randomness That gets interjected is just how those people do because you can't predict them And they can do whatever they want.

470
00:37:33,189 --> 00:37:35,180
Speaker 0: but in a two-player game, there's just two people.

471
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:47,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you you know, even if the game has some sort of thing where you can play it once you play it again There's only so many thing ways you can play it where the two people won't do the exact same thing every same time.

472
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:52,174
Speaker 1: Yep, and This game does not solve that problem.

473
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:57,476
Speaker 0: Yep Surprisingly this guy says they sell well on eBay, but I don't know how true that is.

474
00:37:57,636 --> 00:37:57,917
Speaker 0: Huh?

475
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:01,079
Speaker 1: Yeah So this next one we played once.

476
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,187
Speaker 0: We kind of we didn't finish it.

477
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:04,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, we stopped playing.

478
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:06,020
Speaker 1: I don't think we really understood how to play.

479
00:38:06,343 --> 00:38:07,317
Speaker 0: I don't understand how to play.

480
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:11,115
Speaker 1: Fortress America looks like a cool concept.

481
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:12,440
Speaker 0: It does seem really cool.

482
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,520
Speaker 0: basically, you have this big map of the United of the continental United States and One person is the US and everyone else is not.

483
00:38:20,082 --> 00:38:26,924
Speaker 1: The plot is that the entire world hates the US and has decided to get rid of us once and for all and we're being Invaded on three fronts.

484
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:27,306
Speaker 1: Hmm.

485
00:38:27,868 --> 00:38:33,487
Speaker 0: Now what's interesting is that this is the one game in the series based on Future and not history.

486
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:37,000
Speaker 0: It's like it's like a theoretical future plot.

487
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:40,772
Speaker 0: It's not real and obviously it still isn't real though.

488
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:41,755
Speaker 1: It's slightly predictive.

489
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:43,160
Speaker 1: I mean most of the world hates us now.

490
00:38:43,461 --> 00:38:48,558
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but the all the other games are based on some sort of history axis analysis.

491
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:51,699
Speaker 0: World War two Shogun is ancient Japan.

492
00:38:52,382 --> 00:38:54,589
Speaker 1: Feudal Japan not a little Japan, right?

493
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,294
Speaker 0: I don't know the difference.

494
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:58,280
Speaker 0: Well, I do know the difference but I always get them confused.

495
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:04,498
Speaker 0: And The other one's based on Romans or pirates and this one is based on made-up crap.

496
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:19,816
Speaker 0: But it's still cool because there's a map of the US and on the sides and the oceans There's basically these columns and the bad and whoever is not America The bad guys is basically cramming units into these columns to jam them into the United States.

497
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:33,940
Speaker 1: now independent of all that Not only are there three large conglomerate armies trying to invade the United States luckily Canada stays out of it But there are partisans within the United States who have taken this opportunity in the chaos to revolt against the federal government.

498
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:37,952
Speaker 0: so basically the whole game is one person is the u.s.

499
00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:44,339
Speaker 0: Trying to hold on and Everyone else is trying to screw the u.s.

500
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:48,499
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much a one guy against everyone.

501
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,220
Speaker 1: game Yeah, and the one guy starts out at a huge disadvantage.

502
00:39:51,381 --> 00:39:56,379
Speaker 1: but the longer the game goes on the more and more troops he gets as America mobilizes for war.

503
00:39:56,399 --> 00:40:02,799
Speaker 1: and Basically, if they don't capture America and defeat it completely quick enough they lose and America pushes them all out one by one.

504
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:12,912
Speaker 0: Basically what this game comes down to is if the person playing America knows what they're doing versus The other people know what they're doing, you know, because I gain.

505
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:18,760
Speaker 0: that could be fun once maybe twice Yeah, and as soon as everyone figures out exactly what to do for each side.

506
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:23,358
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that the same side will win every time although I'm not sure which side it is.

507
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,246
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it's not America.

508
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:26,772
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it is.

509
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,640
Speaker 1: Yeah America knows what it's doing.

510
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:29,095
Speaker 1: I don't know.

511
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:36,920
Speaker 0: I think if America knows what it's doing But the other guys also know what they're doing then they can just attack and destroy America before it even has a chance.

512
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:40,339
Speaker 1: There's one cool game mechanic though, and that's supply lines.

513
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:42,568
Speaker 1: So all these invading armies are coming in.

514
00:40:42,969 --> 00:40:52,280
Speaker 1: but there's this rule that any unit that's in America That's not American has to have a complete line of supply all the way back to their landing point at all times.

515
00:40:52,842 --> 00:41:00,534
Speaker 1: So if the Americans disrupt your supply chain all the units upstream of that die They run out of fuel and they just can't function anymore.

516
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:04,572
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It's kind of a neat mechanic and I wish the game were better.

517
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,800
Speaker 0: so I think that's America's only real chance.

518
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:25,140
Speaker 0: You see is to win is to disrupt those supply lines and I'm my guess is that the people who are attacking if They know what they're doing can defend those supply lines against everything except, you know Some randomness and if they do that then America has no chance because America's only chance is to start the supply lines.

519
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:38,130
Speaker 1: well, I was reading that apparently the game always seems to plateau where the three allies are gaining ground and gaining ground and kicking America's ass and Then the game plateaus and there's a small core of America left.

520
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:47,720
Speaker 1: But at this point America just starts pushing back out And then almost every time America gets to the brink of losing and then comes back strong and kicks everyone's asses.

521
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:51,674
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just supposed to play out that way every single time for fun.

522
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,100
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a jingo is game?

523
00:41:53,664 --> 00:42:02,340
Speaker 0: I think it is partially a jingo is game Definitely, but I wouldn't say I would recommend buying it, but it might be fun to play it once.

524
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:04,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's definitely a part of board game history.

525
00:42:04,729 --> 00:42:07,259
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm as little fun little tanks and things in it.

526
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:19,400
Speaker 1: Now the last one is the one that is near and dear to us Shogun which was renamed to samurai swords because the owners of the estate of the book Shogun were giant cocks.

527
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:27,098
Speaker 0: Yeah But it does say on the bore on the game box previously sold as Shogun in case you were wondering and it's a.

528
00:42:27,238 --> 00:42:29,667
Speaker 1: it's a actually Decent war game the only griver.

529
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:35,699
Speaker 1: really have it that other than the ambiguous poorly written rules Is that it takes fucking long to play?

530
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine if you had a game that was really fun and if the game lasted in like an hour long.

531
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,740
Speaker 0: It would be like the best game ever, but the game is like three hours or four hours long.

532
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,550
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like your fun is spread thin.

533
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,440
Speaker 0: We it's not spread too thin that it's unfun.

534
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:56,060
Speaker 0: But the game would be like perfect and amazing if it was two or three hours.

535
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:57,875
Speaker 0: But it now it's just kind of really good.

536
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:03,339
Speaker 1: instead Yep, myself Scott and Pete played one complete game of it over the weekend almost a complete game.

537
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:03,700
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

538
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,588
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I won.

539
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:05,939
Speaker 0: Yeah as complete as it can be.

540
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,802
Speaker 1: Yeah we played.

541
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:14,134
Speaker 1: it took about three a little over three hours to play not counting the time we spent figuring out the rules and The game came to.

542
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:14,580
Speaker 1: it was funny.

543
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:24,960
Speaker 1: It came down to because basically the mechanics of the game or that you have units that you can put out in the various provinces You've captured but you also have three armies and the army has a marker on the board.

544
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:31,480
Speaker 1: That's a unit holding the flag of that army And then you have the units that are in the army sitting on a little board next to you separate.

545
00:43:32,222 --> 00:43:35,060
Speaker 1: So there are little provincial forces whatever guarding territories.

546
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:39,520
Speaker 1: But the real game are the actual conquering armies marching around and posturing.

547
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:50,160
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like risk only less random and Instead of risk where you have, you know, just your armies are just normal and they're in every country all over the place.

548
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:56,340
Speaker 0: It's every province you have is basically weak as hell and has a few defending units just to you know.

549
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:06,600
Speaker 0: Hold the enemies at bay a little bit and you have three really big Armies that are like giant globs of units that are super dangerous and they walk around the board individually.

550
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:14,203
Speaker 1: You know conquering and defending and the whole game is them clashing because you start with three and they all have names and there's actually A lot of color in the game.

551
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:22,100
Speaker 1: every player color has three real generals from that era that were allied in some way or members Of the same faction or what have you?

552
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:35,800
Speaker 0: and each general has like a different colored flag and a different shape so that it in those often those flags actually somehow match the Historic flags of those generals or show guns and stuff and all the pieces in the game are really nice.

553
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:44,947
Speaker 0: You have these really brightly colored guys and little spearmen bowmen swordsmen Ronan Gunners gunners the Daimyo.

554
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:46,292
Speaker 0: the Daimyo is really cool.

555
00:44:46,332 --> 00:44:48,439
Speaker 0: The castles and the fortresses are really cool.

556
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:54,220
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, there's a lot to this game and really our only gameplay gripe with it is that it takes too freakin long to play.

557
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:57,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the money in the game of this little Goku.

558
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,400
Speaker 0: They're red and with a little hole in them look like real old money and it has a lot of strategic elements.

559
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:06,159
Speaker 1: There's no one way like one way to I'm going to win.

560
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:25,600
Speaker 1: There's a lot of posturing and yelling at people and diplomacy and then you have money based on how many territory you have and then you bid that money secretly like you allocate where you're going to spend your money on secretly and then everyone reveals simultaneously and In addition to that some things that you allocate money to our bids like you bid on the ninja.

561
00:45:26,202 --> 00:45:33,399
Speaker 1: so say I'm sitting there and I need the ninja because I want to assassinate Pete's Daimyo before he Marches into my fortress and kills my last guy.

562
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,780
Speaker 1: but then Scott seems to want the Daimyo.

563
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:41,179
Speaker 1: I know that Scott wants the ninja because he doesn't want me to do that because he wants to go march in and take it.

564
00:45:41,984 --> 00:45:43,091
Speaker 1: So I got to figure out.

565
00:45:43,151 --> 00:45:44,360
Speaker 1: how much do I bid on the ninja?

566
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,980
Speaker 1: I don't want to over bid because I need that money to spend on troops and such.

567
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:50,529
Speaker 1: But if I underbid he'll get the ninja and I'm boned.

568
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,991
Speaker 1: Hmm.

569
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:54,162
Speaker 0: Oh the ninja might fail and you might get revenge Who knows?

570
00:45:54,382 --> 00:46:00,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ninja has some randomness associated with it, but you paid for that ninja and you chose to use it.

571
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:07,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you don't use it You can always use it to look at someone else's bidding in the next round which can be really useful and turn order.

572
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:07,722
Speaker 1: There's no.

573
00:46:07,742 --> 00:46:18,229
Speaker 1: a lot of games have a right left problem where the boot depending on who sits to your right or left You'll have a. it'll affect the game a lot Like Puerto Rico is nefarious in this.

574
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:20,196
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and so is st.

575
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:21,240
Speaker 1: Petersburg to a degree.

576
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:25,470
Speaker 1: But uh this game it doesn't do it that way.

577
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:31,420
Speaker 1: instead you have these swords with numbers on them and you draw them randomly And then you go in the order of the swords one, two, three, four five.

578
00:46:31,862 --> 00:46:34,897
Speaker 0: But if you want you can spend money to choose which sword you get.

579
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:37,660
Speaker 0: if you want You know the one two, three fourth or fifth sword.

580
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,620
Speaker 0: If you want to go usually want to go first you want to go last depending on what your situation is.

581
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:43,643
Speaker 1: There's just.

582
00:46:43,723 --> 00:46:45,875
Speaker 1: there's so many strategic elements to this game.

583
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:54,846
Speaker 1: It's fantastic Mm-hmm and a lot of color like we played it out quite a bit in college and we have Scott here You know rim and Scott geek nights.

584
00:46:55,208 --> 00:47:05,997
Speaker 1: We have another friend named Scott and in two separate games Individually independent of each other one of them tried to hold on to this one area of the board That's pretty much impossible to hold on to.

585
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:13,060
Speaker 0: yeah It's like right in the middle Like and in between these two separate islands and it's you just basically surround it if you're stuck.

586
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:14,729
Speaker 1: It feels like Asia in risk.

587
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:19,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we dubbed it Scotland Not Scotland, but Scotland.

588
00:47:19,707 --> 00:47:23,580
Speaker 1: Yep, and the last game we played it was going on pretty well.

589
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:30,945
Speaker 1: Eventually, like all the armies are marching around kind of getting closer each other and backing off getting close and backing off everyone's kind of solidifying their position.

590
00:47:31,627 --> 00:47:47,265
Speaker 1: and then the army started fighting and in the end I had two powerful freaking armies marching around Uncontested while Scott's last time yo and Pete's last time yo or each hold up in giant well-defended Fortresses hiding from me.

591
00:47:47,726 --> 00:47:51,860
Speaker 1: Yep, and then we decided that it would take too many hours to finish the game and we just stopped playing.

592
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:57,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty good, but I think my problem was is that I tried to be the the offensive guy.

593
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:03,887
Speaker 0: I was trying to kill other people's Daimyo's and as a result I killed one of yours and then mine.

594
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:05,715
Speaker 0: the guy who did the killing died.

595
00:48:05,755 --> 00:48:08,419
Speaker 0: and then I tried to kill one of Pete's and The guy who did the killing died.

596
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:15,120
Speaker 0: So I think the strategy in the game is to you know not go in for the kill until the guy is weak.

597
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:25,260
Speaker 0: You know if you try to go in for the kill when the guy is not ultra weak, you know You're asking for it, but someone has to go in for the kill and if no one does then they're all grabbing territory.

598
00:48:25,381 --> 00:48:26,004
Speaker 1: And there's a lot.

599
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:27,955
Speaker 1: it's mostly posturing as far as I can tell.

600
00:48:28,257 --> 00:48:28,740
Speaker 1: it's another good.

601
00:48:29,362 --> 00:48:34,440
Speaker 0: Another good strategy is to gang up two of your Daimyo's against one of his if you catch him in a bad position.

602
00:48:34,884 --> 00:48:35,771
Speaker 0: You know that that's key.

603
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:39,439
Speaker 0: That's why when you level them up You can move them real far to get him into positions like that.

604
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:50,185
Speaker 1: Yep Like I played a nice bit where Pete's Daimyo was was kind of dangerous because one of them I'd been Neglecting one of my armies and it wasn't that well equipped and it's just kind of moving around gathering territory along my borders.

605
00:48:50,729 --> 00:49:05,015
Speaker 1: and Pete's army is coming for me and Instead of coming straight at me He jumped to take an island from me because islands are actually very defensible positions because attacking over the water You're at a huge disadvantage if you're the attacker and the island was poorly defended.

606
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:05,657
Speaker 1: I know army.

607
00:49:05,697 --> 00:49:06,520
Speaker 1: They're just some troops.

608
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:07,678
Speaker 1: So he took my island.

609
00:49:08,563 --> 00:49:18,520
Speaker 1: So I jumped my Daimyo like I bid so I could go first and I put an army at The at the territory that he just jumped from so he couldn't jump back without fighting my army at that disadvantage.

610
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:24,715
Speaker 1: And then he tried to take other island territories to get around and I put another army there and I basically trapped him in the ocean.

611
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:37,140
Speaker 0: Yep It's just really cool and and I like the theme and I like everything about it Except for the fact that it takes freaking forever though I think now that we know how to play we'll be able to play it faster.

612
00:49:37,581 --> 00:49:38,825
Speaker 0: We will be able to play it faster.

613
00:49:38,886 --> 00:49:43,240
Speaker 0: But this isn't a game you can play too often without it getting really painful.

614
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,925
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah like Illuminati.

615
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:49,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I could stand to play Illuminati more often than I could play this.

616
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:53,834
Speaker 1: I don't know because I always think that but then I play Illuminati again.

617
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:55,380
Speaker 1: I remember how much it pisses me off.

618
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:58,149
Speaker 0: Hmm, maybe I haven't played it in a while.

619
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:01,500
Speaker 0: I think it's just because it's time to play Illuminati again, you know.

620
00:50:01,801 --> 00:50:03,167
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we don't own it anymore.

621
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:05,979
Speaker 1: our friend who we haven't actually heard from in a long time owns it.

622
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,828
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll buy it this Saturday or something.

623
00:50:07,848 --> 00:50:11,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe when I'm in Rochester, I'll buy that Mafia one.

624
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,173
Speaker 1: that's almost the same game.

625
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:15,379
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, when you go to Rochester you buy a bunch of new German games for us.

626
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:21,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I got to say that millennium in Rochester is really the only gaming store in the world that we know of.

627
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:21,720
Speaker 1: that's good.

628
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can't find them around here.

629
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:35,143
Speaker 0: I mean there is one around here but it doesn't have nearly the selection of German games and they have too much of the store devoted to stuff like video games paintball yugioh Airsoft.

630
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:35,545
Speaker 0: Yeah.

631
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:48,736
Speaker 0: Yeah makes yeah, but Millennium just sells role-playing games board games miniatures games and card games really And a small section for stuff like, you know, fancy mahjong sets and such.

632
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:52,472
Speaker 1: Yep It definitely catered to the euro gamer and all of us.

633
00:50:52,492 --> 00:50:53,015
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

634
00:50:53,356 --> 00:51:02,547
