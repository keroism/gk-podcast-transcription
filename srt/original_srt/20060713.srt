1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,997
Speaker 0: It's Thursday July 13th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:19,539
Speaker 0: tonight We talk about the horrors and ordeals of trying to move all of our stuff from Rochester, New York to Beacon, New York.

3
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,637
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:26,173
Speaker 1: I'm sitting in my office all alone today and some people walk in.

5
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,120
Speaker 0: did they catch you doing anything bad?

6
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:31,917
Speaker 1: No, no, I go and I see and he's two young guys.

7
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:38,291
Speaker 1: one guy he said he was 24 the other guy was 30-something whatever and They were door-to-door salesmen.

8
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,820
Speaker 1: I didn't which I didn't realize at first.

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,074
Speaker 1: I was like did anyone from my company tell you to come here?

10
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:43,556
Speaker 1: did you know?

11
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,179
Speaker 1: because yeah?

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:58,339
Speaker 1: People from my company don't communicate with me so much, so if they were sending someone I wouldn't know man how many people would kill for jobs like what we have yeah, and they said that they were from a company that does Rico copier.

13
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:10,019
Speaker 1: you know service stuff and I had a Rico copier right there and They didn't even realize it like they were going door-to-door, and it took me like a whole minute to get that out of them.

14
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,727
Speaker 1: so anyway You know they.

15
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:18,511
Speaker 1: they looked at my copier a bit And I tried to get them to do some stuff for free, but they wouldn't.

16
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,517
Speaker 0: what'd you try to get him to do set up?

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,551
Speaker 1: Copier to do like the scanning properly.

18
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,898
Speaker 0: That's pretty easy to do.

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,719
Speaker 1: yeah I don't think I think they were too smart to do anything without actually getting a service contract.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,189
Speaker 1: Anyway, but as time went on it proceeded to just kind of sit down and talk to these guys and hang out for like 20 Minutes and talk about stuff.

21
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,320
Speaker 0: Did you tell him about geek nights?

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:49,025
Speaker 1: No, but I talked to them about you know geeks and nerds and video games and All kinds of stuff.

23
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,533
Speaker 1: one guy was like you know man.

24
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:53,279
Speaker 1: You should get on the Craigslist.

25
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,805
Speaker 1: I'm like yeah I know all about Craigslist.

26
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:57,700
Speaker 1: He's like yeah, you could use it like one guy was only.

27
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:01,299
Speaker 0: That's like a guy coming up to me and saying yeah, there's this internet.

28
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:02,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but it's like one guy.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,418
Speaker 1: He thought it was all into video games that the older guy and the other guy was all about.

30
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,543
Speaker 1: ladies That's all he.

31
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:09,889
Speaker 1: he was like man.

32
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,440
Speaker 1: You could totally like get some ladies right in here.

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,827
Speaker 1: And I was like yes the thought had occurred to me before But the problem is is like you never know.

34
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,294
Speaker 1: the CEO can just show up randomly, and then what do I do?

35
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:23,355
Speaker 1: uh?

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,820
Speaker 0: You know what you do what George Costanza?

37
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:30,639
Speaker 0: Did you ever see that one episode of Seinfeld where he got caught having sex with another employee?

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,831
Speaker 0: Nope, he goes it like.

39
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:37,282
Speaker 0: they fire him like equally They call him in like the boss calls him into the office the next day And he's like.

40
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:44,999
Speaker 0: George has come to my attention that you engaged in blah blah blah blah at your desk and George sits there and says Was that wrong?

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,365
Speaker 0: Was I not supposed to do that?

42
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:53,245
Speaker 0: because if there wasn't a memo or anything so I wasn't entirely sure if that was against company Or not.

43
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:55,619
Speaker 0: you see and he just goes on and on and on.

44
00:02:56,081 --> 00:03:03,885
Speaker 1: Have a feeling that if I'm doing some random girl from Craigslist well semi random girl from Craigslist in the office And the CEO shows up.

45
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:05,450
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be fired.

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,000
Speaker 0: see now one you probably would love to get fired.

47
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:15,239
Speaker 0: So not only would I give you an awesome story, and it would give you an excuse to leave that job But it would lose me a whole reference for the next job.

48
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,070
Speaker 0: No, because the people call say yes.

49
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,894
Speaker 0: He was employed by us.

50
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:19,095
Speaker 0: Yes.

51
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:19,759
Speaker 0: He did great work.

52
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:20,825
Speaker 0: Why'd you fire him?

53
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:29,380
Speaker 0: because he made it with some woman in his cube Not in my cube in my entire empty office, and then they think oh he was the manager of an office somewhere.

54
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus you.

55
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,894
Speaker 0: when you go to another job, and they ask why'd you leave your last job?

56
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:37,405
Speaker 0: You say I was fired And just tell him exactly what happened.

57
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,136
Speaker 1: no, but I might you know put a thing on Craigslist.

58
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:44,700
Speaker 1: like I am a geek Is there a geek girl out there?

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,998
Speaker 0: You know what you should because if nothing else we'll have some awesome stories to tell on the show about.

60
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:52,713
Speaker 1: at the Absolute worst I get no emails whatsoever.

61
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:58,973
Speaker 1: at the absolute best I get laid at the absolute minimal in between honestly.

62
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,538
Speaker 1: I dare some emails.

63
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:01,300
Speaker 1: That'll be humorous.

64
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,217
Speaker 0: You should check out otaku booty.

65
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:04,987
Speaker 1: You know that doesn't?

66
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,078
Speaker 1: it doesn't seem to happen in actually.

67
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:10,736
Speaker 0: yeah well the thing is from what I can gather it seemed really happening when it started.

68
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:15,280
Speaker 0: and then The horny kids who go to anime cons realize they didn't need a website.

69
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:29,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, if only I was a horny teenager again, oh yeah I gotta say if anime culture those are the days and anime cons Existed in their current form when I was between the ages of 14 and 17 well see I already had that.

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,946
Speaker 1: It was just not at anime cons.

71
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,010
Speaker 1: It was at some other kinds.

72
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:37,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had that too, but it was in band camp, but Anime culture is just so far and away from that.

73
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:38,569
Speaker 1: Yeah.

74
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, though you ran into some stealth geeks.

75
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:50,451
Speaker 0: I also found Archaeological evidence of a geek somewhere in beacon Archaeological evidence, so I was riding my bike around today.

76
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:59,434
Speaker 0: You know I was poking it because I promised our friend yuko We explored a bunch of factories before but the one I really wanted to like go in and show her the inside of someone had locked it.

77
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:06,915
Speaker 0: So recently some kids had unlocked it and I've been going by it periodically to make sure it's still unlocked and I can still get into it.

78
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:21,835
Speaker 0: and As I was biking around I passed a park bench, and I sit on it to retie my shoe And then I see there's graffiti on the park bench in marker and one of the graffiti says very specifically Inu Yasha rocks exclamation point.

79
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:25,991
Speaker 1: heart Sounds to me like some girl from beacon high school.

80
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:27,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what a geeks?

81
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:31,399
Speaker 1: a geek Yeah, but it's not someone useful to us.

82
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:40,454
Speaker 0: Hey finding any geek would be an advantage at this point because as far as our lives is gone All I can say is that if girls from beacon high school start showing up.

83
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:41,538
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

84
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:43,449
Speaker 1: you know You're gonna be in trouble.

85
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:44,659
Speaker 0: No he put him on the show.

86
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:52,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I would pretty much interview any geek and I met him a file you At this point.

87
00:05:52,865 --> 00:06:01,078
Speaker 0: I mean if some hole is that one of those homeless crazy guys on the street was walking by and he was Like grumble grumble grumble master Keaton I'd whip out a microphone and interview him.

88
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:06,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be great All right, so do I do the new segment?

89
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:12,792
Speaker 0: oh the new segment that we don't have music for yet But we decided to do over aim about seven hours ago.

90
00:06:12,813 --> 00:06:12,873
Speaker 0: Yep.

91
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:14,398
Speaker 1: We have a new segment.

92
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,023
Speaker 1: everybody Guess what.

93
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:16,945
Speaker 1: we have a new segment.

94
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,811
Speaker 0: It's called geek back.

95
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:28,876
Speaker 1: Yes every show from now on Before we do the news we're gonna do geek back because mainly a lot of other podcasts will.

96
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:39,711
Speaker 0: they get a lot of user art Listener feedback I almost said user feedback and they'll you know read the emails and play the voice feedback and then they'll talk about it every episode and we Get a lot of emails.

97
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:45,554
Speaker 0: like we get a lot of stuff from fans But we always respond to it in email and it never really sees the show.

98
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:54,099
Speaker 0: so it's like we're doing geek nights the show And we're doing geek nights the forum and we're doing geek nights the email personal conversation, and they're all separate.

99
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,520
Speaker 1: yep.

100
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:09,176
Speaker 1: So the geek back segment what we are going to do is each show we will either play one voicemail read one email or barring a lack of Emails and voicemail well at least good ones.

101
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 1: yeah good ones.

102
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:27,239
Speaker 1: we will read something from the forum and then talk about it for a little bit and This should hopefully a encourage more user fee listener feedback and I Don't know make people feel good when we read their stuff on the show.

103
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 0: Yeah Because I can say okay, and hopefully it's entertaining for all the people who do email us and contact us.

104
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:38,999
Speaker 0: We do read every single one of them and even if we don't respond to you we talk to each other about it a lot and

105
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:45,478
Speaker 1: That will continue until the number of emails we get is too many and it is not yet too many

106
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:52,700
Speaker 0: at which point I think we'll start paying mr.. Period or something and we'll get him to be a secretary and filter the email for us or something.

107
00:07:52,961 --> 00:08:04,615
Speaker 1: Yep, all right, so the email we're gonna read today is from our good friend Bayway Chang Who you might remember is our only PayPal donator as of yet?

108
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,076
Speaker 0: Yep?

109
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:05,818
Speaker 0: I can say up.

110
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:07,576
Speaker 1: What did you do?

111
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,193
Speaker 1: What'd you do?

112
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,191
Speaker 0: Now I can say that I think what?

113
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:16,191
Speaker 0: because we whenever we get money I think we're not gonna use it on ourselves.

114
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:18,400
Speaker 0: We're probably just gonna buy more equipment for the podcast.

115
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, like more microphones.

116
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,374
Speaker 1: Maybe some booms.

117
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:23,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I need a boom guy.

118
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:33,159
Speaker 0: I think for this one for the the money you gave us work I'm gonna buy some sort of dynamic omnidirectional mic for our geek roundtables that we're gonna be doing at Otacon.

119
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:33,480
Speaker 1: Yep.

120
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,575
Speaker 1: So anyway, oh again about the PayPal donations.

121
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:38,919
Speaker 1: don't pay us money.

122
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously you have the ability to give us money, but don't all right, so let's read Bayways email.

123
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:52,820
Speaker 1: Remon Scott I was on vacation when I listened to your podcast in which you outed me as a PayPal donator to the show.

124
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:54,519
Speaker 1: Thanks didn't expect that.

125
00:08:55,344 --> 00:09:01,735
Speaker 1: You didn't have any place in the PayPal form to include a note So I didn't get a chance to give you some kudos along with the dollar sign.

126
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:02,700
Speaker 0: I like kudos.

127
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:08,300
Speaker 1: I found your show via Mark Johnson's mention on board games to go and I was hooked by your podcast style.

128
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,005
Speaker 1: Great professional job.

129
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:10,888
Speaker 1: You guys are doing.

130
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:14,058
Speaker 1: you really managed to keep a tight interesting show going every night.

131
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:22,480
Speaker 1: kudos I've been catching up on all your other non gaming shows except anime, which I don't have any interest in and They're fun and interesting.

132
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,227
Speaker 1: Hope you guys keep going for a long time.

133
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:29,860
Speaker 1: use the dollar sign for whatever just want to support stuff that I listen to regularly.

134
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:36,920
Speaker 1: Also, you may have been the first folks who have ever pronounced my name correctly without hints and on air - Cheers Bay.

135
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:45,019
Speaker 0: Yep, I gotta say when it comes to names if it's a nationality or language We're at all familiar with we usually don't have any trouble with that.

136
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:54,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if I see a name that I have no idea how to pronounce I go with the phonetics You know hoping that someone romanized it correctly.

137
00:09:55,001 --> 00:10:01,160
Speaker 0: The only thing that'll get me is if it's a like if it's written in Cyrillic, I can't read Cyrillic at all.

138
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:04,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'll just read it the way it looks which is completely wrong.

139
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:12,940
Speaker 1: I Tend to read, you know I go for the phonetics which means I pronounce things more often than most people because a lot of people don't can't even manage that.

140
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:13,238
Speaker 1: Yeah.

141
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:29,719
Speaker 1: and then if that fails if someone says it correctly to me once that I'm good unless it's a tongue twister and I Just can't do it, but that's so rare Yeah, so Thank You Bay way.

142
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:39,600
Speaker 0: Yeah Wow, we didn't have so much to say about that partly I think because we decided to do this bit before the show today and then we talked for a while about name pronunciation.

143
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:43,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that and then we tried to talk about it again.

144
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:49,588
Speaker 1: The only things I really have to say about it is yeah, Mark Johnson has a cool podcast called board games to go Where he just talks about board games.

145
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should probably play his promo at some point.

146
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,787
Speaker 1: I think we should play it Tuesday.

147
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:53,732
Speaker 0: That was my plan.

148
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:54,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good one.

149
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:58,351
Speaker 1: and Yeah, it's kind of weird people giving us props.

150
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,920
Speaker 1: We're still waiting for a hate mail.

151
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:05,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first hate the first legitimate hate mail is gonna get into the geek back section.

152
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,362
Speaker 0: So, you know what?

153
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:11,197
Speaker 0: I think the first real legitimate hate mail we get we'll send them a prize like congratulations.

154
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:12,100
Speaker 0: You're our first hate mail.

155
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:12,885
Speaker 0: Thank you so much.

156
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,180
Speaker 1: Yes, and we'll know if it's a real hate mail or not.

157
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,690
Speaker 1: So all you listeners looking for prizes, we'll know.

158
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:33,796
Speaker 0: yeah, if I get an email smarter than you from like That's why you listen to us and not vice-versa if I get an email from Pete saying yeah you atheists are all gonna rot in hell and Yeah I'll know.

159
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:39,439
Speaker 0: Alright, so we got some news and it's Thursday so we can do whatever the hell news we want.

160
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,189
Speaker 0: Because we've kind of decided.

161
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,129
Speaker 0: originally we tried to make the news Bit whatever day of the week.

162
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,255
Speaker 0: it was whenever we could.

163
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:50,019
Speaker 0: so if it was Tuesday We try to have some sort of gaming news or related to gaming news.

164
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:59,316
Speaker 0: But lately if you've noticed there's been so much tech news That we've been just going longer and longer longer on the news and our show is basically geek nights.

165
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:00,680
Speaker 0: Plus the 20-minute twit.

166
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,791
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, so we're pushing ourselves back to that.

167
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,360
Speaker 0: of course now it's Thursday so I could shout to hell until next week.

168
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:09,965
Speaker 0: But I actually had a bunch of news.

169
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,975
Speaker 0: is that I'm holding off on now until the appropriate day?

170
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:16,071
Speaker 0: because really and actually Someone who sent us some feedback.

171
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:24,167
Speaker 0: We're not gonna read yet on the air Accused me of editorial izing why to which I say We don't cover the news.

172
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,236
Speaker 0: We do nothing but editorial eyes.

173
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:27,280
Speaker 0: What do you want?

174
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,953
Speaker 1: I mean if you're listening to this show The news segment of geek nights is not to tell you the news and inform you.

175
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,899
Speaker 0: if it was I'd be talking about Israel.

176
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:47,137
Speaker 1: right now If you need to be informed you need to go on the internet to Google News and read a lot or Fark or dig Or anything anything slash that even the point of us going over the news is.

177
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,375
Speaker 1: we say oh look This is a story that happened today.

178
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:59,360
Speaker 1: now Let us talk about it, you know And we hope that the reason you're listening is to hear our interesting perspective on the events of the recent times.

179
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:03,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you know Penn Jillette on his show always says yeah, we take the nut position.

180
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,372
Speaker 0: I guess Scott and I tend to take the asshole position.

181
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:06,874
Speaker 0: Yep.

182
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:11,007
Speaker 1: We take the asshole Geek somewhat elitist position.

183
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:15,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we're not gonna pretend we're not just a little bit elitist Yep, at least on some things.

184
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:17,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're very proletarian.

185
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:21,798
Speaker 0: on other things Yes, namely things that would give us a bunch of money that we could then use to become elite.

186
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:41,100
Speaker 0: Ah Anyway, my news is actually video game related But it's also a bunch of other things related and it's something that I knew For a long time because of where I worked and I couldn't say anything about it and now it's been released Officially by other sources meaning I can talk all I want.

187
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:48,661
Speaker 0: Sony has admitted that the yields on the PlayStation 3 chips are Terrible.

188
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:54,840
Speaker 1: now wait, wait, wait, didn't you say that, you know Sony ordered X chips and IBM gave them X chips.

189
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:59,660
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is IBM doesn't make all the chips because there are a lot of other companies involved.

190
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:01,393
Speaker 1: We're talking about the cell chips here.

191
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:04,830
Speaker 0: Yes, the cell chips I can't talk about this part in great detail.

192
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,700
Speaker 0: you asked about the one thing I still can't talk about but IBM does not make all of the cell chips.

193
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,437
Speaker 0: IBM's primary thing is that they came up with the cell chip and they know all about it.

194
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:28,363
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Manufacturing is licensed out to a lot of other fabs simply by the fact that Sony's 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter fabs while very advanced are not as big as the fabs that like AMD and Intel and Chartered and all these.

195
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,933
Speaker 1: of course AMD and Intel have the biggest fabs in the world.

196
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,559
Speaker 1: You can't really an Nvidia?

197
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,534
Speaker 0: I guess Yeah But the point is just that the yields were low.

198
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:43,020
Speaker 0: now when you make chips The yields are basically the percentage of chips that come out the end of your production line working.

199
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:53,900
Speaker 1: yeah, because when you may have anyone who doesn't know and you make chips you make them on this big wafer and the wafer has Like a zillion chips on it like hundreds of them even and it's a big wafer of silicon.

200
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,764
Speaker 1: They're really cool-looking.

201
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:57,559
Speaker 0: I had a shiny one that I that was busted that I used as a.

202
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:06,840
Speaker 1: yeah it's a big silicon disk and on it are a bunch of chips like just laid out in a grid and They cut the chips out because they're all little squares or rectangles.

203
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,715
Speaker 1: They cut them out and they test them individually and some of them work and some of them don't.

204
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:11,417
Speaker 0: actually there's.

205
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,313
Speaker 0: there's some chips Where they can test them on the wafer.

206
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:13,738
Speaker 0: There's yeah.

207
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you get the idea but the point is that the yields on the cell processors are abysmal.

208
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,070
Speaker 0: and By abysmal and I'm not kidding they're taught.

209
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,660
Speaker 0: we're talking five to ten percent of the chips succeed.

210
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:32,398
Speaker 1: So that means you make a hundred chips on this wafer and only like five to ten of them actually work.

211
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:37,040
Speaker 0: the rest of them You just throw away, but you still paid for making a hundred of them.

212
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:49,496
Speaker 1: imagine if at the the Ford factory where they make Mustangs if they made a hundred Mustangs and then only five of them worked and They had a 95 broken Mustangs that they couldn't do anything with except recycle for materials.

213
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:52,668
Speaker 0: or imagine your your and you're in the Bronx.

214
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:58,556
Speaker 0: you want to buy some falafel and you give the guy money and there's a 95% chance that he says no falafel for you.

215
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,142
Speaker 0: Try again It sucks.

216
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:08,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean it could be why the PlayStation 3 is so expensive despite not being that much more powerful than other stuff.

217
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:15,660
Speaker 0: well I mean yield yields tend to be a very tricky business and the Information about yields in factories tends to be very well guarded.

218
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:22,640
Speaker 0: I happen to know a lot of this because I worked in the factory where all this was going down and it's fine.

219
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:34,028
Speaker 0: I mean it's finally been released that the yields are so low and A lot of people are saying that the cell chips just can't be made efficiently and that there's really no Solution that's going to come anytime in the near future.

220
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:43,790
Speaker 0: And all I have to say about this now is that either IBM is losing a lot of money on this or Sony is losing a lot of money on this.

221
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,656
Speaker 1: so betting that Sony is losing the money.

222
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:50,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, because honestly There's other things I can't talk about but IBM is not stupid.

223
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:54,720
Speaker 0: I don't think IBM cared at all if the PlayStation 3 was successful or not.

224
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:55,620
Speaker 1: Michael my you know.

225
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,277
Speaker 1: The thing that I got is way back in the day when the when the word cell chip first came around.

226
00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:28,462
Speaker 1: the idea was that Instead of having a CPU you would have like a GPU and a physics PU and an audio PU and that they would all kind of work together in sort of this, you know Communication way like a bunch of cells and that way without instead of having a central processing unit one big powerful Chip, you just have a whole mess of chips that were all kind of weak but combined all working together They would form some sort of living working.

227
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:34,820
Speaker 0: there was actually a lot of confusion in the outside world as to what cell meant because no one was very clear on it.

228
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,818
Speaker 1: it Became almost a buzzword Yeah, and now it seems like it doesn't really mean anything except a different architecture other than PPC and x86 and etc.

229
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:43,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's just.

230
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,259
Speaker 0: there's all sorts of trouble with it.

231
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:51,170
Speaker 0: Someone's taking a bath and I don't think IBM cares because honestly I You said taking a bath.

232
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:55,307
Speaker 0: I get the impression Why is saying taking a bath bad?

233
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:56,631
Speaker 0: what you're busting my balls here?

234
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:57,515
Speaker 1: It's not bad.

235
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,000
Speaker 0: It's just you're busting my balls.

236
00:17:59,081 --> 00:17:59,747
Speaker 1: Just humorous.

237
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:00,838
Speaker 0: why you gotta bust my balls?

238
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,858
Speaker 1: Okay, because you didn't take a bad.

239
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're always silly on Thursdays.

240
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:17,115
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh my guess my uninformed Me just guessing out of the air.

241
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:18,040
Speaker 0: This is not factual.

242
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:37,539
Speaker 0: anyway opinion is that the PlayStation 3 and the Sony orders were largely just kind of a test of the cell chips and a way to recoup some of the cost of R&D and I think cells are going to find a lot of applications in other arenas and Sony is just getting fucked over this.

243
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:48,659
Speaker 0: Okay, I note this only because I know that a lot of people I talked to while I worked there Who were higher up than me or who knew more about the manufacturing process than me?

244
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:52,940
Speaker 0: I would always say things because I always knew all the news that I could know from the outside world.

245
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:58,552
Speaker 0: In fact, my department has talked to me a few times Complaining that they don't know what's going on anymore because I'm not there.

246
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:13,340
Speaker 0: I told him Reed Fark but I would say things like the PlayStation 3 is gonna fail for these reasons or I heard that the PlayStation 3 is aren't doing well because Of this and I'd say something like that's really gonna hurt IBM's bottom line, isn't it?

247
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,942
Speaker 0: And they would just laugh and that was it Awesome.

248
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:21,457
Speaker 0: I think Sony is really just not gonna come out.

249
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:32,290
Speaker 1: so well Yeah I mean if I make engines and some car is gonna use my engine and I sell those engines to those guys and then Their car doesn't sell sure.

250
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,540
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna sell any more engines.

251
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,187
Speaker 1: But you know that it doesn't work.

252
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:47,620
Speaker 1: where they make a deal where I'm gonna constantly make engines It's a deal where they say make this many and I profit on each and every single order they make and if I'm not Doing that then I'm running my business improperly.

253
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:54,960
Speaker 1: So as long as you take it one order at a time, you can't fail to profit in the manufacturing business.

254
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,300
Speaker 0: Now because I'm not bound by the NDA is anymore.

255
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,048
Speaker 0: At least I'm not bound by NDA is when it comes to new information that I made discover I'm only bound by the NDA.

256
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,113
Speaker 0: is that cover information.

257
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:11,260
Speaker 0: I learned while I wasn't employee Mm-hmm, so I'll see if I can get some inside sources and find out more about this goal.

258
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,970
Speaker 0: Cuz if I convince someone else to tell me it's perfectly okay.

259
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,278
Speaker 1: It's for it's them breaking the NDA not you.

260
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:23,171
Speaker 1: Yes alright, so My news is that you know, the RA goes around suing everyone.

261
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, they sued a bunch of mommies and old ladies and kids.

262
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:29,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, now there was a lady in who lives close to us.

263
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,245
Speaker 1: She lives in like Poughkeepsie or someone and she was fighting and some other lady I think in Oregon was fighting.

264
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:42,849
Speaker 1: Yep, but there is one woman in Oklahoma named Debbie Foster.

265
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:49,740
Speaker 1: Oh Oklahoma where the wind comes rushing down the plane you mean where the RA fails in the core.

266
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,402
Speaker 0: That was lame.

267
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:52,123
Speaker 1: That was lame.

268
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:53,105
Speaker 0: That was bad.

269
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:56,149
Speaker 1: I couldn't think of anything that rhymed better, but look he mighty.

270
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,560
Speaker 1: Yes So she fought the RA.

271
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:06,021
Speaker 1: They said what they did is they came up to her of course and they said settle the case for $5,000.

272
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,652
Speaker 1: She said no, you know what?

273
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:08,779
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go fight you in court.

274
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:19,252
Speaker 1: So she said RA you must provide, you know dates and the names of the files I downloaded and all this kind of evidence, you know evidence.

275
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:26,185
Speaker 1: and the RA said Yeah, we can't Provide that information.

276
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:28,454
Speaker 1: We don't have any evidence basically.

277
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:28,956
Speaker 1: Yep.

278
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,579
Speaker 0: They gave up.

279
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:37,713
Speaker 1: So Debbie Foster filed a motion for summary judgment, which basically says Hey judge, they don't have any evidence.

280
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:38,620
Speaker 1: end this shit.

281
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:41,611
Speaker 0: Yeah it's kind of like one of the mechanics and burning wheel dismiss.

282
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:46,060
Speaker 0: you just go up to the judge and basically say This case is stupid and it's obvious.

283
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,751
Speaker 0: Please throw it out and the judge can say yes or no.

284
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:53,205
Speaker 1: now before the judge had a chance to say yes or no the RA said you know what.

285
00:21:53,525 --> 00:22:00,330
Speaker 1: since we got no evidence we out and The court said all right, you're out with prejudice.

286
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:03,180
Speaker 0: Now that is something that judges can do it.

287
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:05,530
Speaker 0: There's a lot of situations where they can do it.

288
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,541
Speaker 0: But if they if you dismiss a case, it's like alright the case is done.

289
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:15,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you dismiss it with prejudice It's the judge officially saying that not only is this done, but you're an idiot.

290
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:33,750
Speaker 1: Now, let me read this sentence here in his opinion judge Lee R West wrote Because this court finds the plaintiffs voluntary dismissal with prejudice services as a complete education of the issues set forth in Their complaint and acts as a bar to further action on their claims.

291
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:37,822
Speaker 1: The court concludes the matter has been finally educated in the defendants favor.

292
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,186
Speaker 0: I think you mean adjudicated.

293
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:50,667
Speaker 1: Oh, you're right adjudicated God Which represents a judicially sanctioned material alteration in the legal relationship between Deborah Foster and the plaintiffs.

294
00:22:50,807 --> 00:23:01,405
Speaker 1: miss Foster is therefore the prevailing party for purposes of the Copyright Act and That also means the RA has to pay for the legal fees of Debbie Foster.

295
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:02,910
Speaker 0: See I wish they'd sue me.

296
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:04,358
Speaker 0: I have a lawyer ready.

297
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:06,450
Speaker 0: I'm just waiting for someone to sue me at this point.

298
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:10,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have a lawyer so I don't really want to be sued so badly.

299
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:25,084
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, but I just note again because I've said this a bunch of times but for all the fire and fury of the RIAA and the MPAA suing people They haven't won as far as I know any case.

300
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:30,654
Speaker 0: every single case They have brought every single lawsuit has either Settled out of court.

301
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:41,858
Speaker 0: or if the person had the cajones the testicular fortitude to fight They always win because the RIAA's case is bullshit Yep, and they got no evidence.

302
00:23:42,018 --> 00:24:02,202
Speaker 0: I mean honestly even if you upload and download files There is really no way to prove in a court of law that that was the case And the amount of effort and energy the RIAA would have to put forth to actually even come close to securing a judgment in their favor Would be more than the money they could ever get out of the purse

303
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:05,412
Speaker 1: and especially when you consider the number of cases They're doing.

304
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:11,790
Speaker 1: if everyone fought they basically wouldn't have enough legal power to actually do all those cases.

305
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:16,162
Speaker 1: They only have enough legal power to do all those settlements because settlements are easy.

306
00:24:16,443 --> 00:24:17,867
Speaker 1: It's give us money or else.

307
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:18,670
Speaker 1: Okay, here you go.

308
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:26,390
Speaker 1: If they actually had to fight all those cases in court They'd have to just give up most of them and they probably lose all of them.

309
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:37,400
Speaker 0: the moral here is very simple if you were sued and you know, you're in the right or you know that you will win or You have testicular fortitude Fight you'll probably win.

310
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't be a wuss All right.

311
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:41,864
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't be a menace.

312
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:53,809
Speaker 1: Yeah Since the beginning of time humans have sought to express their innermost thoughts Their deepest desires.

313
00:24:54,432 --> 00:25:00,573
Speaker 1: van Gogh Picasso Caveman number 17 all were overlooked in their time.

00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,633

315
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,220

00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:23,694
Speaker 0: like it just happened some Fox reporter is in Lebanon.

338

339
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:30,590
Speaker 0: Yes Well, I mean I just remember that cuz the fighting right now is in Lebanon mostly.

340
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:38,750
Speaker 0: but anyway, there was a reason in the Gaza Strip and there's a Israeli tank division or brigade or something right over the hill?

341
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:57,368
Speaker 0: I just out of camera range and he's there covering the story and You know, he's just there in those open field No one around wearing this little flak jacket and he's talking about, you know there's Israeli troops right there and he's live on the air and then Someone who is most likely an Israeli troop start shooting at him.

342
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:11,690
Speaker 0: Yeah and and the funny thing is it like it he runs away and it cuts back to like the guys and The two guys and the girl who were at the Fox studio and the one woman's like run away hide run away.

343
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,192
Speaker 0: What are we like?

344
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:18,136
Speaker 0: yelling at the guy to like get out of the way and then it's all over and the one guy is Like yeah, you know warzone whatever.

345
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:19,921
Speaker 0: and then the stupid guy.

346
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:21,645
Speaker 1: Oh the stupid guy.

347
00:27:21,686 --> 00:27:23,310
Speaker 0: There's a guy sitting on the right of the screen.

348
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:32,910
Speaker 0: I don't know any of these Fox News anchors are but this guy not the brightest he has a kind of a sloping forehead and He starts saying like why would they shoot at him?

349
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,497
Speaker 0: He has press written clearly on the front and back.

350
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:36,199
Speaker 0: you could see it.

351
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:39,810
Speaker 0: and the smart guy is like, um, it's a warzone.

352
00:27:41,012 --> 00:27:44,330
Speaker 0: They were far away and they saw a guy with something that might have looked like a weapon.

353
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,398
Speaker 0: You just shoot at him and he's like.

354
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,768
Speaker 0: but it had press written all over it.

355
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,413
Speaker 0: But but but.

356
00:27:50,574 --> 00:27:51,156
Speaker 0: and the guys like.

357
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,803
Speaker 0: those bad people shoot at anyone they see.

358
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:55,989
Speaker 0: and then the guys like but it was Israel.

359
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,179
Speaker 0: and then the guy the smart guy just didn't say anything.

360
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:11,170
Speaker 0: and then they cut away and the guys like if that guy is still Has his job Wow, and the fact that after the guy said bad guys shoot at people and then later the guys like really and it was just this.

361
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,846
Speaker 0: I really can't describe how dumb this guy looked.

362
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:16,956
Speaker 1: Wow This guy is real stupid.

363
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:27,968
Speaker 0: more to the point if you're ever a press person in a warzone and you're filming live Don't say where any troops are because they're going to shoot you.

364
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:31,378
Speaker 1: the thing is I don't think that they heard the guy sang.

365
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:32,942
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no, definitely not.

366
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,085
Speaker 0: but there's a good chance.

367
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:45,170
Speaker 0: that I mean Israel I know for a fact is probably watching any live news They see to make sure that there's no intelligence leaking out and I wouldn't be surprised if the guy kept reporting or something.

368
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:46,357
Speaker 0: They were just shelled the area.

369
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they have planes everywhere.

370
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:50,189
Speaker 1: They can just go boom anytime they want.

371
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:54,610
Speaker 0: Yeah where they want because I mean the situation going on now is a lot like the six-day war where?

372
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,298
Speaker 0: Israel has complete and total air superiority.

373
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,864
Speaker 0: So no one else really has a chance.

374
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

375
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:02,330
Speaker 1: I'm just glad I'm on this side of the world.

376
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:10,841
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's a bunch of crazies over there and I feel bad for the non crazies that are over there because there's a lot Of non crazies over there those non crazies.

377
00:29:11,303 --> 00:29:12,649
Speaker 1: escape escape over here.

378
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're not crazy, then you won't mind doing that.

379
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:20,410
Speaker 0: I mean for every time on the news you see like a bunch of Palestinians dancing around a burning American flag.

380
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:24,386
Speaker 0: There's twice as many Palestinians sit in their houses going god damn it.

381
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:25,130
Speaker 0: They're at it again.

382
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:34,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know every time you see like Israeli soldiers marching in somewhere, you know shooting at people There are a bunch of Israeli people sitting at home playing video games going god.

383
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:38,218
Speaker 0: Damn it Yeah, so you got a news.

384
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:40,145
Speaker 1: yeah, I do a thing of the day.

385
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:41,430
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, it's things of the daytime.

386
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:54,990
Speaker 1: So at USC, which I guess is University of South Carolina, I'm not sure There's this the vice president of the Student Council went away to Washington to do some talking.

387
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:56,359
Speaker 1: I guess I don't know.

388
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,204
Speaker 1: What about some?

389
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:57,868
Speaker 1: something lame?

390
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, while he was away the rest of the Student Council filled his office with balloons.

391
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:03,954
Speaker 0: Now one.

392
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:08,189
Speaker 0: this is an awesome prank that I've pulled more than once in my life on people and to.

393
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:18,550
Speaker 0: The thing of the day that Scott is about to describe is Much like the video of the dude attacking those kids who were skateboarding an example of what is wrong with this country.

394
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:19,874
Speaker 1: Well wrong with people.

395
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:24,950
Speaker 0: I think wrong with people who are indignant and annoying and able to be annoyed right now.

396
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:28,570
Speaker 1: The first problem is when you pull a practical joke, right?

397
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:38,560
Speaker 1: What you want to do is you want to have a lot of people there and when the joke is pulled You need to have those people immediately Laughing hysterically non-stop or else it doesn't work.

398
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:46,050
Speaker 0: unless it's one of those subtle Andy Kaufman style jokes Yeah, but those don't really work so well, you know in general they work really well.

399
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:52,163
Speaker 0: The problem is not many people get to see the result Yeah, or they're a long-term thing like you screw with a guy over the course of several months.

400
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:53,086
Speaker 1: Yeah.

401
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:57,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Obviously if we had done this to someone everyone would gonna.

402
00:30:59,352 --> 00:31:01,179
Speaker 1: And if like it happened to you you would just go.

403
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,545
Speaker 1: oh you got me.

404
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:04,272
Speaker 1: All right, let's pop all these balloons Yep.

405
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:11,409
Speaker 1: Now this guy obviously has a Pole longer than 10 feet long up his ass.

406
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:12,895
Speaker 1: There is no question.

407
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:18,857
Speaker 1: and he goes in and he you know, he's already mad about something Maybe he knows the balloons already.

408
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,950
Speaker 1: and he goes in and he opens his door and he starts yelling at everyone.

409
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:23,510
Speaker 1: He's like, oh, it's not funny.

410
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:28,130
Speaker 0: The best part is when he's like the one guy who's standing there's just laughing hysterically.

411
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,094
Speaker 0: He's like you.

412
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,038
Speaker 0: don't think I'm serious.

413
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:31,403
Speaker 0: Look at me being serious.

414
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,070
Speaker 0: Look at me being serious.

415
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,886
Speaker 1: And everyone's like this is a waste of the students money.

416
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:36,529
Speaker 1: blah blah blah blah.

417
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:42,230
Speaker 0: And at this point everyone stops laughing because they're like they realize that wow, this guy's just a giant douche.

418
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:47,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you can't stop laughing or else that's what helps these people out.

419
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:50,377
Speaker 1: You have to keep laughing Even if it's not funny anymore.

420
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:53,530
Speaker 1: keep laughing cuz it's so much better.

421
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:59,597
Speaker 1: If a guy is yelling and screaming seriously and you just keep laughing Then it makes it feel stupid.

422
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:09,810
Speaker 0: if you actually shut up then it puts him above you and it's like oh Though then that this guy starts arguing with these people like this was a waste of money of student money.

423
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,282
Speaker 0: And they're like, yeah who paid for these balloons?

424
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:12,230
Speaker 1: He's like we paid for them.

425
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,619
Speaker 1: They're like 80 bucks for balloons big deal.

426
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,487
Speaker 1: Then he's like, well, where'd the air come from?

427
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:17,310
Speaker 0: Air's not free.

428
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:30,910
Speaker 1: Yeah says that he does say is that this is a guy with no sense of humor and These are the people that I I say are the worst people on earth people who are just no sense of humor.

429
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,774
Speaker 1: You're a bad person.

430
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:33,562
Speaker 0: Well, there have been multiple Canadian.

431
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:35,410
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know why I said Canadians.

432
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,610
Speaker 0: There have been multiple Canadian comedians out there who have made jokes to the effect of all the problems in the Middle East.

433
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:44,686
Speaker 0: Come down to the fact that the people involved in these problems just have no sense of humor.

434
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:47,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Yeah, that's really it.

435
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,229
Speaker 0: if you have a sense of humor It's very hard for you to do evil things

436
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:53,724
Speaker 1: And the better your sense of humor is the harder it is for you to do evil

437
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:57,321
Speaker 0: or in the very least even if you can Do evil things and laugh about it like a maniacal.

438
00:32:57,401 --> 00:32:59,050
Speaker 1: I think what was Lewis Black's joke?

439
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:12,844
Speaker 1: Like, you know you go up to someone and you say Yeah, if you if you go and become a suicide bomber then when you get to heaven, there's a bunch of virgins You know, but someone actually doesn't have a sense of humor and believes that.

440
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:22,090
Speaker 0: well now you got a scary dude Yep, plus by the converse anyone who has a sense of humor is much more easily able to deal with problems.

441
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:26,269
Speaker 0: I mean Say you're walking into a movie and you drop your drink.

442
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:30,089
Speaker 0: Someone with a sense of humor would go and maybe make a self-deprecating joke.

443
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:32,561
Speaker 0: Someone without a sense of humor will.

444
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,425
Speaker 0: that's the end of the world.

445
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:37,081
Speaker 0: my drink Son of a bitch damn it.

446
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:37,584
Speaker 1: Damn it.

447
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:37,926
Speaker 1: Damn it.

448
00:33:38,006 --> 00:33:46,469
Speaker 1: or even worse Let's say a guy with the sense of humor You know is walking down the hallway and he bumps into someone and they spills and the soda spills on both of them.

449
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:48,963
Speaker 1: if The both guys have a sense of humor they go.

450
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,553
Speaker 1: Oh Shit.

451
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:51,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're all wet.

452
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:52,661
Speaker 1: All right, let's go wash it off.

453
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:54,870
Speaker 0: All right, talk about a sticky situation.

454
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:58,350
Speaker 1: If they don't have a sense of humor, it's gonna be a fistfight.

455
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,799
Speaker 1: So, you know when someone what that's great?

456
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:06,030
Speaker 0: because then everyone else around with a sense of humor gets to watch a fistfight.

457
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:14,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is is sometimes if it's more than a fistfight like in the Middle East and such well Yeah, other people nearby get hurt.

458
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,964
Speaker 1: I mean, what if it was a bomb fight?

459
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:17,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not so good in the movie.

460
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,349
Speaker 0: See, why can't Hezbollah just sneak into Israel and instead of blowing someone up just throw a water balloon at someone and run away?

461
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,648
Speaker 1: Go to the Knesset and fill it with balloons.

462
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:41,391
Speaker 0: You know what if that happened if if terrorists we started doing things like that like instead of blowing up a building Go and set off a bunch of balloons in the building or some sort of giant prank in the building that says one Go

463
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:42,960
Speaker 1: fill the White House of golf balls.

464
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:43,764
Speaker 0: cuz think about this.

465
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:44,690
Speaker 0: in one go.

466
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,860
Speaker 0: It says I could have blown you up, but I didn't.

467
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,545
Speaker 0: and two it's funny.

468
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get your point.

469
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:52,235
Speaker 1: That's what we need to do.

470
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:55,775
Speaker 1: We need to start an organization of Comedic terrorism.

471
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:59,809
Speaker 1: Frank Eris we go and we'll fill the Empire State Building with whipped cream.

472
00:35:03,023 --> 00:35:07,641
Speaker 1: Okay All right, anyway, so yeah watch this guy and despise him.

473
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:10,789
Speaker 1: and if you ever meet someone like this make sure you.

474
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:13,825
Speaker 1: I don't know laugh deprecate them.

475
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:21,437
Speaker 0: actually I remember a book I read when I was in middle school and I don't remember what it was called or anything But it basically involved.

476
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:23,605
Speaker 0: I think it was Poseidon or Zeus.

477
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,010
Speaker 1: Poseidon such a prick.

478
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,502
Speaker 0: I know Poseidon is the big but he's the awesomest.

479
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,307
Speaker 0: what besides?

480
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 0: just an asshole.

481
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,376
Speaker 1: He's so awesome.

482
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:33,770
Speaker 0: I only get away with saying he's an asshole cuz I don't go on the ocean often.

483
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't get me so easily.

484
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:41,050
Speaker 0: You can bet that I'll be singing a different tune if I'm on a ship with Odysseus.

485
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:45,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right, but I forget if it was Poseidon or Zeus or exactly what it was.

486
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,575
Speaker 0: But there's this book about.

487
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:52,688
Speaker 0: you know modern world and as this Greek God wakes up, and he's like hey I'm back and you know what are the ramifications of that.

488
00:35:52,708 --> 00:36:07,449
Speaker 0: and In the end it gets to the point where the reason he left in the first place way back was that he took over a village and the villagers realized eventually like the villagers drove away by laughing at him like they were like you're just as washed up old God and the village laughed at him.

489
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:10,419
Speaker 0: And then he just killed them all and went to sleep.

490
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:16,621
Speaker 0: and the end of the book involves everyone just laughing at this God again To try to make him go away, and he finally realizes.

491
00:36:16,902 --> 00:36:17,966
Speaker 0: Oh, and then he just leaves.

492
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,773
Speaker 1: yep It sounds like a good.

493
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,641
Speaker 0: you got to do to people like that.

494
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:26,668
Speaker 0: what the people in that book in that village that was fake Did to Zeus or possibly Poseidon mm-hmm?

495
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:31,403
Speaker 0: I wish I knew what book it was or what it was actually about.

496
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:34,498
Speaker 1: if someone knows the book tell us Yeah, no, I read it.

Speaker 0: It wasn't like.

00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:45,101

Speaker 0: It was alright.

505
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:54,009
Speaker 1: I guess you know lensman's actually turning it out to be kind of a pulp story, but it's good.

518
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:24,409
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about logical fallacies But we're gonna wait a little bit on that though.

519
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:36,682
Speaker 0: Mad props to all of you in the forums who have been arguing by means of fallacies as in pointing fallacies out in other people Because not to flame the guy whose name is blast flame.

520
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a terrible argument.

521
00:37:39,554 --> 00:37:43,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean seriously You just contradicted yourself.

522
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:44,446
Speaker 0: You can't come in.

523
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:45,290
Speaker 1: your hypocritical.

525
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, really and the burden of proof was still on you.

526
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:58,498
Speaker 0: in fact It is still on you if you want to keep arguing.

527
00:37:58,758 --> 00:38:02,570
Speaker 1: yeah, so I think he's pretty much given up at this point.

528
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:04,310
Speaker 1: It'd be interesting to see if he has anything.

529
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:08,970
Speaker 0: Was I think it was the goth father, but I can't say offhand who who just posted.

530
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:15,602
Speaker 0: He didn't say anything He just quoted this dude, and then he was like fallacy of accident And I felt I almost laughed out loud at work.

531
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:22,105
Speaker 0: that was like the most awesome thing it made my day Yep, so keep that up, but we decided we would tell another geek fable.

532
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:23,530
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a geek fable.

533
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:25,343
Speaker 1: How was the last time we did a geek fable?

534
00:38:25,444 --> 00:38:26,149

00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:33,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's been a while since a how to not suck also Yeah for and this is kind of both But it's more of a fable because we're not gonna talk about how to do this though.

536
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:34,730
Speaker 0: That would be a good episode.

537
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:37,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to talk about what happened when we did it.

538
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:39,450
Speaker 1: alright, so let's start.

539

551
00:39:26,794 --> 00:39:33,790
Speaker 1: I brought to Connecticut when I left our RIT like a year later The stuff that was important, but I didn't need day to day.

552
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:40,067
Speaker 1: I put in storage in Rochester in one of those store-to-door boxes and the stuff I didn't care about.

553
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:40,990
Speaker 1: I just left with Kevin.

554
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:43,682

562
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we found this place and we decided to rent it.

563
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,189
Speaker 1: We signed the papers and it was time to move in.

564
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:09,970
Speaker 0: So now we're when we're sitting in our house our empty house and we're like, alright now we have to get all of our shit.

565
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:14,369
Speaker 0: yep, and All I have to say is that it was quite an ordeal.

566
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:15,815
Speaker 1: Moving sucks.

567
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:18,130
Speaker 0: Now the worst part is it could have been so much easier.

568
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:20,730
Speaker 1: It could have been if you would have hired some guys and paid more money.

569
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:21,909
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

570
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:32,705
Speaker 0: there are a whole bunch of companies that will come to your house pack up everything you own take it to your new house and Unpack it all or at least put it all in the proper room and leave.

571
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:33,610
Speaker 1: they cost a fortune.

572
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,522
Speaker 0: Here's the thing they don't cost that much and because that much.

573
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,755
Speaker 1: but they cost more than what we got now But not that much more.

574
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,946
Speaker 0: actually I got some quotes hundreds of dollars hundreds dollars, whatever.

575
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:43,870
Speaker 0: that would have been so worth it.

576
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, and plus we get big discounts from our IT and I got an IBM discount.

577
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:51,114
Speaker 0: but or every single one of them.

578
00:40:51,134 --> 00:40:56,398
Speaker 0: because oh, that's right, I called like ten of these companies and Every one of them was like yeah.

579
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:57,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, this will be great.

580
00:40:57,364 --> 00:40:58,490
Speaker 0: I was they were like, how far are you moving?

581
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,410
Speaker 0: I was like about four three hundred and twenty miles.

582
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,430
Speaker 0: They're like, oh that'll be great quote and it wasn't a bad price at all.

583
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:06,101
Speaker 0: And then they were like, all right from where to where.

584
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:12,609
Speaker 0: and I was like Rochester, New York to Beacon, New York One end of New York to the other and then they'd be quiet and none of them would do it.

585
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,984
Speaker 0: Apparently none of these companies will ship your stuff within a state.

586
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:18,630
Speaker 0: They will only go over state lines.

587
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:23,930
Speaker 1: I don't know what people do if they have to move like across Texas or from the north of California to the south.

588
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,352
Speaker 0: You know what.

589
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:26,159
Speaker 0: the same thing we did suck.

590
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know why that is.

591
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,310
Speaker 0: If anyone does know why tell us yeah kind of like how come in New York City?

592
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:34,327
Speaker 0: They give everyone a straw no matter what you buy.

593
00:41:34,853 --> 00:41:37,460
Speaker 0: Yeah Why do people do that?

594
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,450
Speaker 1: I don't know anyway.

595
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:44,269
Speaker 1: So what we did is he went to Rochester where most much of the goods were and we rented a truck.

596
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:48,140
Speaker 0: now I rented a twelve foot or a four.

597
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,189
Speaker 0: I rented a 14 foot budget moving truck.

598
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,977
Speaker 1: now That's a pretty good sized truck.

599
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:59,943
Speaker 1: It would be a tight fit for all our stuff, but it would have been okay Yeah, plus there were some things like the couches.

600
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:00,809
Speaker 0: We're just gonna throw away.

601
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:02,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were gonna throw away a lot of the big stuff.

602
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:08,539
Speaker 0: So it wasn't a big deal and also was cheap and it was pretty much the largest truck I would have felt comfortable driving.

603
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:17,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, we get there and as I pull up I noticed that there's nothing but 24-foot trucks as in not a truck, but it's almost a semi.

604
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,922
Speaker 0: It is a giant tractor like just oh my god kind of.

605
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:23,190
Speaker 1: it wasn't a trailer, but it was a big truck.

606
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one of those.

607
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:27,698
Speaker 1: any bigger would have been a tractor trailing Yeah, but it was massive like.

608
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:30,670
Speaker 0: I had a lot of trouble with this thing, but I'll talk about all that.

609
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:40,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is is that they reserve the right to give you a bigger truck for the same price, you know They won't give you a smaller truck for the same price because that's ripping you off.

610
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:48,990
Speaker 1: But if you want let's say, you know a pickup truck They'll they can just give you like a moving van at the same price as a pickup truck.

611
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:53,683
Speaker 0: So now we've got this truck and we're in downtown Rochester and we're trying.

612
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:54,144
Speaker 0: I'm trying.

613
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,571
Speaker 0: no Scott wouldn't drive it and Pete wouldn't drive It.

614
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:58,158
Speaker 0: so I had he can't drive.

615
00:42:58,479 --> 00:42:58,861
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

616
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:00,810
Speaker 0: Well, no, he wouldn't drive it of course.

617
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, he couldn't drive and you were just afraid to drive it.

618
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:07,921
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna drive I wasn't gonna be held responsible for something that was rented in your name.

619
00:43:08,402 --> 00:43:08,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:43:08,884 --> 00:43:09,064
Speaker 0: Yeah.

621
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:10,048
Speaker 0: Well, you could have rented it.

622
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:13,881
Speaker 1: No No, yeah, why I wasn't gonna was yeah.

623
00:43:14,162 --> 00:43:16,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm driving this giant truck.

624
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:23,075
Speaker 0: I ran over how many curbs and like waste paper bins on the side of a corner and Bumping into things.

625
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:25,143
Speaker 0: this thing was massive and I did.

626
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:25,424
Speaker 0: I did.

627
00:43:25,444 --> 00:43:36,850
Speaker 0: it took me a long time to realize that When you're driving a truck that big you have to practically go past Any street you want to turn down and then do this really sharp kind of turn to get onto it and it was just crazy.

628
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:44,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, so we rented this thing and it all told it cost us over a thousand dollars for the truck and the diesel fuel.

629
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:49,205
Speaker 1: anyway We had to go around filling this truck with our shit.

630
00:43:49,245 --> 00:43:53,069
Speaker 1: So we went to Colony and we emptied that out.

631
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,630
Speaker 0: We got everything in except we took the love seat.

632
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,685
Speaker 0: But we had a big couch that was nasty and we just told Kevin he'd keep it.

633
00:43:58,725 --> 00:43:59,710
Speaker 0: I just threw it away.

634
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:09,775
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing was that it was kind of good that we got this giant truck because We were able to put so much more stuff in it and we didn't have a problem fitting it in because it was so much More space than we needed.

635
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:13,690
Speaker 1: We just kind of kept loading stuff in with no worries about running out of space.

636
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:18,750
Speaker 0: Yep, like with the smaller truck it would have all fit but we would have had to pack it all like specially and planned it.

637
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:21,120
Speaker 0: It would have taken a long time with the giant truck.

638
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,890
Speaker 1: We just kind of tossed shit in until we were done Yep.

639
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,357
Speaker 0: So then we got all of our stuff from colony.

640
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:30,410
Speaker 0: that took hours and it was tedious and painful and everything was heavy.

641
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:37,624
Speaker 1: Then we went to the place where my stuff was stored Yep, which meant I had to drive around downtown Rochester again, which sucked.

642
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:43,070
Speaker 1: that was right near the airport We should have known but anyway, we got there and it was actually pretty simple.

643
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:54,335
Speaker 1: we drove the truck up to the box as close as we could and I didn't have so much stuff in the box and we just kind of emptied the entire contents into the truck and it Didn't really take long at all.

644
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:55,097
Speaker 1: It was like oh, we're done.

645
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:59,310
Speaker 0: then I had to back that goddamn truck out of that place.

646
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:02,585
Speaker 0: I was so afraid I was just gonna like mow down a bunch of nuns.

647
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:03,570
Speaker 1: It would have been awesome.

648
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:07,703
Speaker 0: Anyway, I wouldn't want to get nun juices all over it.

649
00:45:07,925 --> 00:45:08,086
Speaker 1: Yep.

650
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:08,267
Speaker 1: Yep.

651
00:45:08,287 --> 00:45:14,390
Speaker 0: Yep All right, then we had to drive the truck all the way out to Leroy, which isn't so far.

652
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,996
Speaker 0: It was like a 40-minute drive.

653
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:17,543
Speaker 0: I couldn't speed at this point.

654
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,210
Speaker 1: I was no longer in the truck.

655
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott just drove back to our house at this point.

656
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,221
Speaker 0: Basically.

657
00:45:22,362 --> 00:45:23,667
Speaker 1: I took the car and I was like say

658
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:34,050
Speaker 0: yeah So me and Pete are driving this truck to Leroy to Emily's house to get like things like my giant bed which I couldn't leave in the apartment because Kevin needed a place to put his bed and Brendan doesn't know me.

659
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:41,410
Speaker 0: My bed is a giant ass queen size like cherry oak bed with a giant like double thick pillow top and the bed is huge.

660
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:42,964
Speaker 1: It's just a queen size bed.

661
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:43,589
Speaker 1: It's not that big.

662
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,759
Speaker 0: Well, no tall wise it's huge.

663
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,430
Speaker 0: I mean the mattress is like almost two feet thick.

664
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:53,445
Speaker 0: That's about average for a mattress and then the box spring separately is another foot.

665
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:54,989
Speaker 1: That's how box springs are.

666
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,490
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, well, my bed is almost is almost a foot taller than your bed.

667
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's because the frame of my bed is is set lower on to the grass.

668
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,790
Speaker 0: It's this giant as wood bed and is a big headboard and a footer and all that stuff and it's old as hell.

669
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:14,665
Speaker 0: There's a cool story about it like it's from my family from way way way back and Stuff like that that I couldn't keep in in the apartment.

670
00:46:15,068 --> 00:46:20,630
Speaker 0: additionally They had a giant couch that they didn't want anymore and the couch had a lot of attachment.

671
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:28,170
Speaker 0: I mean they'd had it for a long time and Emily had that very fond memories of laying on that couch when sick or just hanging around in the couch when she was young.

672
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,689
Speaker 0: And it was it's a pretty good couch and it folds out into a bed.

673
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:32,877
Speaker 0: So they asked me you want the couch?

674
00:46:33,017 --> 00:46:36,930
Speaker 1: and I said, yeah, sure because we had just left Kevin the shit couch.

675
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:38,801
Speaker 0: So, alright now we have a good couch.

676
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:39,525
Speaker 0: You have to buy one.

677
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:41,602
Speaker 1: It's yeah We were gonna buy a couch.

678
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:45,827
Speaker 0: if we didn't you know This couch is a thousand times better than the couch we left behind and it was free.

679
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:48,005
Speaker 1: Yep So hey better than buying one.

680
00:46:48,025 --> 00:46:48,469
Speaker 1: Let's take it.

681
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:55,456
Speaker 0: So Pete and I go to pick it up and carry it out of Emily's family's house at which point I forget which one of us said it.

682
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:57,321
Speaker 0: but we said that thing's a fucker.

683
00:46:57,803 --> 00:47:00,070
Speaker 0: it weighed an infinite number of pounds.

684
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:04,569
Speaker 1: I mean it was like a couch and a bed with a metal frame in.

685
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,540
Speaker 0: it Is like steel.

686
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,259
Speaker 0: the whole thing is steel It's just it and a big heavy wood and God.

687
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:15,030
Speaker 1: and it's so cumbersome because of the way the sofa bed is inside of it.

688
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:17,800
Speaker 0: But you got to be careful or it'll fall out while you're carrying it.

689
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,201
Speaker 0: and it was.

690
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:24,190
Speaker 0: it was so heavy that We could barely lift it, but you finally got it into the truck.

691
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:33,370
Speaker 0: Yes after much doing and then you know We tooled around in Rochester for a while and then Pete and I had to drive this truck all the way back to beacon.

692
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,475
Speaker 0: Hahaha now the thing is Pete.

693
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:46,210
Speaker 0: originally I was gonna go buy Albany drop Pete off at his house and then Continue to beacon where Scott and I would then unload the truck.

694
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,126
Speaker 1: You're gonna stop and go driving around Albany in this giant truck.

695
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:54,481
Speaker 0: now I hadn't even considered at this point unpacking.

696
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:57,290
Speaker 0: I hadn't really thought that through and neither had Scott.

697
00:47:57,934 --> 00:47:59,384
Speaker 0: We just didn't really think about that.

698
00:47:59,404 --> 00:48:02,241
Speaker 0: So Here Pete and I are.

699
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:03,430
Speaker 0: we've got what we get on the throw.

700
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,170
Speaker 0: We were about to go and then Pete hems and haws and then he eventually says, you know what?

701
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:09,618
Speaker 0: Uh, he's gonna skip work on Monday.

702
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:11,044
Speaker 0: He'll just come back to beacon with us.

703
00:48:11,486 --> 00:48:15,650
Speaker 1: Hooray, which means now We don't have to drive the truck all around some crazy roads.

704
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,988
Speaker 0: Well, yeah instead I got to take the fun route 17 way through the mountains Mm-hmm.

705
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:34,130
Speaker 0: So we're driving this massive truck as fast as it can go through the mountains of New York the Poconos Yep on what semi windy not quite a freeway yet roads make your jokes about poking people with noses.

706
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:45,516
Speaker 0: yeah, I just I had to get gas at one point because It's real heavy and that thing had a giant diesel tank, but damn did it use diesel real quick Especially how fast I was trying to make it go.

707
00:48:45,536 --> 00:48:47,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was carrying shit.

708
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:49,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, lots of stuff like the fucker.

709
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:56,310
Speaker 0: So I had an adventure going to a truck stop because I was trying to find diesel fuel and no one had it.

710
00:48:56,631 --> 00:49:04,849
Speaker 0: I eventually had to get off go to a truck stop where I found a diesel fuel thing and truck stops Don't work like gas stations.

711
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:14,770
Speaker 0: There was a thing that I thought I could put my credit card in and it didn't work and eventually it I realized that was A special trucker card and I had to go into the truck stop tell how many gallons of diesel I wanted.

712
00:49:15,092 --> 00:49:15,776
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

713
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:18,190
Speaker 0: she looked at the truck and guessed how much I would need.

714
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:26,510
Speaker 0: It was like something sick like 30 gallons Twice as much as my car holds and I said there was like a timer thing where it filled up automatically.

715
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:34,873
Speaker 0: So while that was going on I went into the truck stop and you know Watch my face in the shower room and I saw a bunch of people watching TV and I got some food and Pete was hanging Out.

716
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:36,544
Speaker 0: we didn't talk to any truckers.

717
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:40,281
Speaker 0: We want to get back on the road But that was an interesting experience in a truck stop.

718
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:40,642
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

719
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:42,449
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll talk about truck stops someday.

720
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:45,220
Speaker 1: So much experience in one truck stop.

721
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,290
Speaker 0: No, I've been in a total of four truck stops.

722
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:50,266
Speaker 0: I have showered in two truck stops.

723
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:58,782
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Yeah, there's this one truck stop in Canada that I stopped at a bunch of times and one time I just showered there Uh-huh, but anyway, we get back on the road now.

724
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,528
Speaker 0: the thing didn't really have a CD player It just had a radio.

725
00:50:02,091 --> 00:50:09,271
Speaker 0: So we're trying to listen to the radio and there were phantom rock because I we'd hit scan right where it would sit on a Station.

726
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:13,168
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah for ten seconds and then we go to the next station, but if it scan again, it'll stop.

727
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:15,222
Speaker 1: meanwhile I'm sitting in beacon going.

728
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:19,490
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah in a mostly empty house with nothing to sleep on or anything.

729
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:24,023
Speaker 0: At least the electricity was on by that point.

730
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:25,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was doing good.

731
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,117
Speaker 0: So now we'd be sitting there to be like crap music.

732
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,985
Speaker 0: guy yelling about Jesus crap music.

733
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,789
Speaker 0: another guy yelling about Jesus.

734
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:38,430
Speaker 0: Zeppelin guy yelling about Jesus and we had really slow reaction times because we were just kind of cruising.

735
00:50:38,893 --> 00:50:40,344
Speaker 0: So we'd get back to the guy yelling about Jesus.

736
00:50:40,364 --> 00:50:41,190
Speaker 0: We're like, hey Zeppelin.

737
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:42,456
Speaker 0: So I hit back.

738
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:57,308
Speaker 0: it would go back to the previous guy yelling about Jesus next and we'd go to the next guy yelling about Jesus and We couldn't find the rock station that was just there and I that wouldn't have been notable Except that that happened like a thousand times.

739
00:50:57,913 --> 00:51:07,855
Speaker 0: There's probably just one or two really weak rock stations But they'd come in on the scan and then when we try to go back they wouldn't be there and even if I went manually I just couldn't find it.

740
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:08,719
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

741
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:09,703
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was.

742
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:15,290
Speaker 0: I Was getting kind of desperate for some non crap music or non guy yelling about Jesus.

743
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:16,535
Speaker 0: We ended up.

744
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:20,617
Speaker 0: you listen to a guy yell about Jesus for a while And he didn't convert you.

745
00:51:20,637 --> 00:51:22,186
Speaker 0: it was mostly just funny.

746
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:32,854
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, so we finally get home and we park it and we get out and Scott stand at the door Like you said something like what took you guys so long and I think I flipped you off Something like that.

747
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:34,098
Speaker 0: and then he's.

748
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:46,769
Speaker 0: and then Scott says Oh Pete and I was like, yeah Pete came and Pete's like yo Hey now for anyone doesn't know Pete we've talked about Pete before Pete's been on our show because Pete is a scientist and Pete is our resident geek night science expert.

749
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:54,975
Speaker 0: We consult him and occasionally our good friend Lisa who was also a scientist whenever there is some sort of sciency truthiness We need to know about.

750
00:51:55,136 --> 00:51:56,283
Speaker 1: and Scott you any other Scott.

751
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,335
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Scott Johnson Pharmaceuticals and also science.

752
00:51:59,475 --> 00:52:01,101
Speaker 0: Yes, we know many scientists.

753
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,868
Speaker 1: I'm a computer scientist.

754
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:07,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever I'm a usability engineer.

755
00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:15,410
Speaker 0: Oh All right, so then we open up the back of the truck and we're like, all right We gotta unpack this thing and the thing right there is the fucker.

756
00:52:16,158 --> 00:52:24,778
Speaker 0: so This is the point at which Scott and I realized looking at this thing that if Pete were not there at that moment and Scott And I had to unload this truck by ourselves.

757
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,229
Speaker 0: There would be no geek nights because we would be dead.

758
00:52:27,672 --> 00:52:38,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, the police would have found two Gangly thin geeks crushed to death under a massive steel couch behind a budget truck on Conklin Street and beacon.

759
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,007
Speaker 1: that is what they would have found.

760
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:46,350
Speaker 0: Yes Even with Pete it took us like a half hour to get this thing into the house.

761
00:52:46,972 --> 00:52:47,996
Speaker 1: It was just ridiculous.

762
00:52:48,056 --> 00:52:51,390
Speaker 1: And even then when he fuck cuz we have to go upstairs to get shit into our house.

763
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:54,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz our house is big and basically our front door and our back door.

764
00:52:54,511 --> 00:52:58,230
Speaker 0: There's a deck on each of them and the deck is up about a half a story.

765
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:02,690
Speaker 0: So it's nice because we have these big decks and they're elevators, you know, the zombies can't get us.

766
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,129
Speaker 0: All we have to do is destroy the stairs and we have a zombie fortress.

767
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:14,769
Speaker 1: But yeah, so this day we did a half hour at least I'm not kidding and then on its way into the house We actually damaged one of the walls in the house.

768
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:17,140
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean we had enough time just getting the thing off the truck.

769
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,797
Speaker 0: like we got it off the truck and now it's laying on Its side in the street and we're standing there like Fuck this thing.

770
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:24,523
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

771
00:53:24,543 --> 00:53:26,977
Speaker 0: Let's just leave it here Let's just leave it.

772
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:46,075
Speaker 0: We don't know where it came from And we finally get it up and we get it and we roll it into the house because we can't really fit it through the Door so well, so it's like up on end and it comes into the house and then it leans over And then it goes BAM into the wall and just push this gash right there and the house We've just moved into.

773
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:54,365
Speaker 0: we've just put a giant security pot deposit down on Put a dent in the wall within an hour of me coming to the house.

774
00:53:54,385 --> 00:54:01,890
Speaker 0: We've already damaged it fucking Luckily, we fixed the damage pretty easily, but we finally got the couch in and I was done.

775
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:03,501
Speaker 0: I really didn't want to unpack anything else.

776
00:54:03,561 --> 00:54:04,125
Speaker 0: I would have been fine.

777
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:08,490
Speaker 1: It's just that couch Yeah, but I think we did eventually bring the rest of the shit in the house.

778
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,149
Speaker 0: Yeah We've decided to unpack the whole thing that night because we didn't want to.

779
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:23,521
Speaker 0: Nothing would have been worse than going to sleep Waking up and realizing we still had all of that shit to unpack and of course not sleeping on beds Yeah, even though I didn't actually put my bed together.

780
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:24,425
Speaker 0: I just slept on the floor.

781
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:26,575
Speaker 1: I slept on my bed Yeah, and keep it.

782
00:54:26,635 --> 00:54:28,022
Speaker 0: I mean we didn't unpack it.

783
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:36,290
Speaker 0: We took us about two weeks Unpack everything we owned to the point that we could live in our house as opposed to just living in a sea of garbage.

784
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:52,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now like even though I might want to move to somewhere else, you know Cuz I have to drive pretty far to work The the effort of moving all this shit out of this house and into some other house is so great That is a huge deterrent to moving anywhere.

785
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:53,179
Speaker 0: Yes.

786
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:10,509
Speaker 0: I mean all told it took us multiple days of concerted effort weeks of planning lots of phone calls over a $1,000 plus the agony of driving a 24-foot fucking truck through the mountains and dropping a couch on us.

787
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:12,095
Speaker 0: So yeah.

788
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the moral of tonight's show.

789
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:17,515
Speaker 0: We love morality.

790
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:18,558
Speaker 0: turn turn turn.

791
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:28,138
Speaker 0: tell us the lesson that we should learn don't move Keep your ass wherever it is just park it and don't move.

792
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:33,298
Speaker 0: or if you're gonna move either pay a bunch of people to do it all for you or Sell everything you got.

793
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:35,067
Speaker 0: move somewhere buy new shit.

794
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:35,730
Speaker 1: exactly.

795
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:39,749
Speaker 1: Don't move with more than you can fit in say the trunk of your car.

796
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:44,750
Speaker 1: I mean good God, you know, or maybe if you can rent a u-haul, that's not so bad.

797
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:56,459
Speaker 1: But now if you have to move like a lot of big things Either pay a shit ton of money to have guys do it for you so that you don't have to do anything or Don't move now.

798
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:57,970
Speaker 0: There are a lot of little corollaries to this.

799
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:11,090
Speaker 0: I mean one thing is that I was a very much a pack rat like I would keep anything that I thought would ever be interesting or useful and After moving I threw away a good quarter of the things I owned because they just they weren't useful.

800
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:16,749
Speaker 0: They were in the way and if I ever move again I'm gonna have to lug that crap around somewhere and stick it.

801
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:24,412
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take it out of one closet Put it in a box go to another house take it out of that box put it back in a closet Exactly.

802
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:26,962
Speaker 0: So I threw away like all my DS game.

803
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:29,190
Speaker 1: Yes, like I threw away a lot of shit.

804
00:56:29,331 --> 00:56:37,654
Speaker 1: You know, there are certain things I keep but you know I keep it limited and there's a lot of shit that I would have kept when I was in say high school that now I Just go huh?

805
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,359
Speaker 1: This is trash.

806
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:39,023
Speaker 0: Yep.

807
00:56:39,043 --> 00:56:39,305
Speaker 0: Yep.

808
00:56:39,325 --> 00:56:48,969
Speaker 1: Yep The collector mentality is pretty much dead and if you're a collector Either a become not a collector and sell your shit on eBay or be don't move.

809
00:56:49,452 --> 00:56:50,379
Speaker 0: I mean God.

810
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:51,768
Speaker 0: like books are the big thing.

811
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:51,990
Speaker 0: now.

812
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:58,232
Speaker 0: I own so many books, but I've lost track or lost or destroyed probably more than half of the books I've ever owned.

813
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:00,922
Speaker 1: Well, you tend to just eat books while you read them.

814
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:06,366
Speaker 1: It's like I think you just well honestly I think your hands have like these book grinders on them.

815
00:57:06,627 --> 00:57:11,549
Speaker 0: Most of my books I don't the books that you've seen me eat are the ones that are very very large.

816
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,978
Speaker 0: You know small books, I don't eat.

817
00:57:14,018 --> 00:57:16,870
Speaker 0: my small books are all in good condition, but like the Count of Monte Cristo.

818
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:17,289
Speaker 0: Yeah.

819
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,879
Speaker 1: so just gonna use as an example the count of Monte Cristo.

820
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:27,050
Speaker 0: one is the longest book I ever read and In like all the way through I've skimmed books that were longer, but those were textbooks.

821
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:36,985
Speaker 0: It's the longest thickest most number of pages book I've ever read and in addition It wasn't bound so wonderfully and I read it over a fairly long period of time.

822
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:38,550
Speaker 0: that book saw some action.

823
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:42,725
Speaker 0: But once I read a book I really completely lose track of it.

824
00:57:42,745 --> 00:57:47,504
Speaker 0: like it doesn't exist anymore I almost immediately will lend it to someone or leave it somewhere.

825
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:52,230
Speaker 0: I'll probably never see it again Mm-hmm, which is fine because I love just lending my books away at this point.

826
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:54,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I lend all my books out and whatever.

827
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:55,711
Speaker 1: But yeah I like.

828
00:57:55,811 --> 00:58:02,110
Speaker 1: I need a new book shelving solution because I'm starting to buy a lot of manga and trade out for bags.

829
00:58:02,451 --> 00:58:07,850
Speaker 1: So right now I have like two or three stacks of them on the floor that I got no shelf to put on.

830
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:14,213
Speaker 0: Looky-mighty if I ever get all those books that I own before I went to college that are currently sitting in my mom's house Aren't those?

831
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:16,530
Speaker 1: aren't most of those just lame D&D books?

832
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:22,009
Speaker 0: No, a lot of them are but by no means not even close to the majority not even a third.

833
00:58:22,551 --> 00:58:23,595
Speaker 1: All right, granted.

834
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,803
Speaker 0: I do own almost every one.

835
00:58:25,843 --> 00:58:27,570
Speaker 1: How many of them are fantasy novels?

836
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,374
Speaker 0: Not that many.

837
00:58:29,474 --> 00:58:35,459
Speaker 0: most of the fantasy I read when I was young were actually the Forgotten Realms novels Which I just said with a D&D book.

838
00:58:35,499 --> 00:58:38,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read mostly well and like Tolkien You know all that stuff.

839
00:58:38,735 --> 00:58:39,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

840
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:47,349
Speaker 0: I read a decent amount of God, I'm not gonna talk about this now But I'll tell we'll do a show on what we used to read and what we read now.

841
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:50,923
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm because I could go on for great deep for many many moons.

842
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:56,077
Speaker 1: if you want to see what I read just go to Apre, ch e dot list.

843
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,424
Speaker 1: all l is ta l calm.

844
00:58:58,565 --> 00:58:58,685
Speaker 0: Yeah.

845
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:00,270
Speaker 0: I'm currently reading a nancy boys.

846
00:59:00,711 --> 00:59:02,737
Speaker 0: I just finished the difference engine.

847
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:07,390
Speaker 1: I'm currently reading galactic patrol the actual first book in the lens min series.

848
00:59:07,851 --> 00:59:10,961
Speaker 0: I should find the novelization of MD Geist and check that out.

849
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:12,265
Speaker 1: Is there a novel ization?

850
00:59:12,325 --> 00:59:13,087
Speaker 0: Probably not.

851
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:13,910
Speaker 1: Is there a manga?

852
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:14,675
Speaker 0: I don't.

853
00:59:14,695 --> 00:59:15,122
Speaker 0: I think so.

854
00:59:15,163 --> 00:59:15,427
Speaker 0: I don't know.

855
00:59:15,692 --> 00:59:16,324
Speaker 0: I really don't know.

856
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:26,761
Speaker 0: Remember my only experience with nb MD guys is that I saw the first like 20 minutes of it and then I heard that review Which was the funniest thing I've ever heard on a podcast other than monkey Tuesday.

857
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:29,247
Speaker 1: All right, I think this episode's over.

858
00:59:29,648 --> 00:59:35,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, though Honestly, I'm really in no in addition to the morale the moral, you know, don't move.

859
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:45,028
Speaker 0: I'm really in no Pressing need to move because the only places I could move from here are closer to New York City which means I'd spend a lot more money.

860
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:55,453
Speaker 0: and Even though I'd be spending more money I'd get smaller and smaller Houses and the closer I get to where any place is that I'll work the smaller my house will be and the more money I'll pay for it.

861
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:09,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, my thoughts on moving are if I get a lot more money I would like to purchase some larger house Perhaps one with three bedrooms or yeah Like maybe three bedrooms and then like a library or something like that.

862
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:21,941
Speaker 0: what I've a separate dining room And what I'd really like to have is a house like a three or four bedroom house basement But in addition to that, I'd like it to have an apartment attached So a friend could live or like the guest apartment or something.

863
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,370
Speaker 1: Yeah or a basement of finished miss.

864
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:35,370
Speaker 0: Yeah for awesome gaming and geeking but in terms of like the area I don't see myself leaving the area I'm living anytime soon just because it's so close to so many places I could commute to if I ever change jobs again.

865
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, it all depends on my job situation.

866
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:38,970
Speaker 0: You're probably gonna get a job.

867
01:00:39,211 --> 01:00:44,110
Speaker 1: You're gonna get a job in the city probably over the next six months and depending on that is what I will do.

868
01:00:44,442 --> 01:00:55,516
Speaker 0: Yeah We're pretty much at the best Cost-benefit ratio analysis place we can be for working in the city because we can't really afford to move closer and especially since it costs to Move it's really hard to.

869
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:58,930
Speaker 1: you know, wherever we are is is oh, you know, it's hard to beat.

870
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:07,021
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus the fact that our house is really even if we find a place that's a little bit better It's not worth the effort of going to there but a place.

871
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:11,677
Speaker 1: if we weren't anywhere yet if we were still nowhere we could have chosen a better place maybe

872
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:23,052
Speaker 0: but a place that is that much better would be so much more and Honestly all the places that are incrementally closer to New York City that we could afford it takes longer to commute there from there than From here.

873
01:01:23,273 --> 01:01:27,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there are express trains that go from Poughkeepsie and Beacon right to the city.

874
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:30,583
Speaker 0: But if you move to the next few towns down there aren't.

875
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,210
Speaker 1: we'd have to move to Croton.

876
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's real expensive to live in Croton.

877
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:35,520
Speaker 1: Is it really?

878
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,001
Speaker 1: Yeah.

879
01:01:36,302 --> 01:01:36,884
Speaker 1: Yeah.

880
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:38,970
Speaker 0: Are you ever seen the Croton Harmon train station?

881
01:01:39,551 --> 01:01:40,354
Speaker 1: It's pretty fancy.

882
01:01:40,394 --> 01:01:42,382
Speaker 0: That is a massive train station.

883
01:01:42,442 --> 01:01:47,590
Speaker 0: It is well, that's because they also have the rail yards there Yeah, but in addition that is a massive commuter place.

884
01:01:48,032 --> 01:01:57,649
Speaker 0: I mean that whole area is just nothing but commuters who make big bucks in the city and I think we're served better by living further away having a longer commute But in addition having a lot more disposable income.

885
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:07,690
Speaker 0: Nice smelling air as opposed to you know, the Bronx or Brooklyn, which I love the work proven where there's a train yard Yeah, and the fact that it's quiet.

886
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:14,349
Speaker 0: I mean I love the fact that I get the New York City and I can go there anytime I want But yet I can also get away from the city whenever I want.

887
01:02:14,851 --> 01:02:15,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just you know.

888
01:02:15,955 --> 01:02:20,430
Speaker 1: a physical house that was perhaps larger or perhaps where we had the basement is all I really asked for.

889
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,890
Speaker 1: All we really need is like one extra room and a basement.

890
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,114
Speaker 0: Honestly, what all I need.

891
01:02:25,154 --> 01:02:31,353
Speaker 0: what I really like to do is just get land somewhere in Beacon or near about like somewhere in this area and Build a house.

892
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:37,756
Speaker 0: to my own specification that would always be good like that would be the most perfect fantastic thing But can't afford not yet.

893
01:02:38,117 --> 01:02:41,870
Speaker 0: Honestly, I think I've got the credit to get a mortgage at this point.

894
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:45,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's really hard to get a mortgage for a land and building a house.

895
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:46,633
Speaker 0: Really not.

896
01:02:46,673 --> 01:02:49,464
Speaker 1: it's easier to get a mortgage for knowing an existing house.

897
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:51,110
Speaker 0: It actually really isn't so bad.

898
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,316
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people who've done it.

899
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:54,287
Speaker 0: In fact, my grandpa built the house.

900
01:02:54,307 --> 01:02:54,749
Speaker 0: He lived in.

901
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:56,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, well if you build the house, that's different.

902
01:02:57,344 --> 01:02:58,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we could pull it off.

903
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,075
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of.

904
01:02:59,095 --> 01:03:00,849
Speaker 0: I think we have better things to spend money on right now.

905
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost definitely like all these cons we keep going to.

906
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:04,299
Speaker 1: yes.

907
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,201
Speaker 1: All right.

908
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:07,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's it.

909
01:03:07,748 --> 01:03:08,430
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

910
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:09,860
Speaker 0: We're done for the week next week.

911
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,290
Speaker 0: We may or may not do a theme week.

912
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,344
Speaker 1: We're not sure yet if you have any ideas for a theme week.

913
01:03:14,585 --> 01:03:15,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, let us know for him.

914
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:21,510

915
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:27,638

Speaker 0: We're going to be doing and the parties that will be following.

917
01:03:30,188 --> 01:03:32,528
Speaker 1: Yep, and Think that covers it.

918
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:38,321
Speaker 0: Yeah The only other thing is we got to figure out we there may or may not be Episodes of geek nights the week after Otakon.

919
01:03:38,562 --> 01:03:40,089
Speaker 0: We're not sure what we're going to do yet.

920
01:03:40,492 --> 01:03:43,210
Speaker 0: Just a heads up to everyone that there's a tiny chance.

921
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,322
Speaker 0: The worst case scenario is there will be no geek nights for one whole week.

922
01:03:47,683 --> 01:03:48,325
Speaker 1: then I got.

923
01:03:48,686 --> 01:03:51,864
