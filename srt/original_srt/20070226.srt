1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,207
Speaker 1: It's Monday February 26th.

2
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:12,631
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:14,798
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,618
Speaker 1: tonight We talk about the ports.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:23,486
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of weird.

7
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,451
Speaker 1: I almost forget.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,220
Speaker 1: We even had a Monday show at this point.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,616
Speaker 0: Well, it's an easy show to cop out on since we usually don't have an idea until the day of.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:36,559
Speaker 0: so we if we're gonna Cop out it's always gonna be on a Monday Especially since we do most of our action on weekends.

11
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:41,680
Speaker 1: So, you know even if we have a craziest weekend ever we'll probably be recovered by Tuesday.

12
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:47,661
Speaker 0: So I will say we probably I mean way back when we thought every now and then about dropping the show down to three nights A week.

13
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,640
Speaker 0: Monday came up on the chopping block first every time but you guys seem to really like it.

14
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:54,616
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's like every time we actually do Monday.

15
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:55,240
Speaker 1: people like woohoo.

16
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:57,716
Speaker 0: So you guys are the reason we're doing it.

17
00:00:59,085 --> 00:00:59,512
Speaker 0: Keep it up.

18
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:01,086
Speaker 0: By keep it up.

19
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:03,299
Speaker 0: I mean listening I guess because there's not much else you can do.

20
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:09,863
Speaker 1: also, I don't think we're gonna have a problem coming up with Mondays for maybe a few months now, so Hooray again.

21
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, well surprisingly.

22
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:17,198
Speaker 0: I'm not tired out from the weekend despite the fact that we played D&D which I think That's just cuz we had that Saturday event.

23
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:24,472
Speaker 0: Well the way we play D&D though is when we play D&D It's not just a bunch of nerds sitting together playing DDD.

24
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,859
Speaker 0: It's basically that DDD.

25
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:33,100
Speaker 0: It's basically this epic event where once a month the entire crew gets together and yells and screams for an entire day.

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,364
Speaker 1: Well, that's how it is these days.

27
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:38,978
Speaker 0: But yeah, well as opposed to college where we'd spend an entire day every week.

28
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:41,445
Speaker 1: Yeah Or every other week.

29
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:44,620
Speaker 0: granted those bastards drank all my part, but that's beside the point.

30
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,080
Speaker 1: They ate the cookies that I made on Friday.

31
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,817
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean the ones that you hid and then they found because you didn't hide him.

32
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:58,433
Speaker 1: very well well, I hit they ate him and then after they ate him I Hid them away and I didn't actually hide them, you know trickily like aha.

33
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,299
Speaker 1: No one will find that I hid them.

34
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:02,260
Speaker 1: Aha, they're not in plain view.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:13,080
Speaker 1: So people who walk into the kitchen to eat the first food they see is probably what they'll grab and they won't think about it Very hard, so they'll see like a big bowl of pretzels and just grab some and won't think where are the cookies?

36
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, except you put it where the glasses are which is where everyone went.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,340
Speaker 0: So they all went to get a glass which I then had to wash and said oh, that's where Scott hid the cookies.

38
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,419
Speaker 0: I will now know where to get a cookie when I want one.

39
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:30,637
Speaker 1: Yeah I figured just you know putting them out of sight would also put them out of mind which did help a little because I imagine If I did not hide them that they would all be gone.

40
00:02:30,698 --> 00:02:35,800
Speaker 0: now We should do what we did at the New Year's party just tape all the cabinets shot every time they come over.

41
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:40,580
Speaker 1: I think another plan would be to poison the cookies next time and leave them in plain sight.

42
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,710
Speaker 0: No, you just make salt cookies salt cookies.

43
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,338
Speaker 0: you say it was a prank in high school that someone did.

44
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:47,020
Speaker 0: they made cookies?

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,546
Speaker 0: But instead of sugar they use salt.

46
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:51,580
Speaker 1: that wouldn't really work because then caramelization would not occur.

47
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,052
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't make caramelizing cookies.

48
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:53,879
Speaker 0: They made sugar cookies.

49
00:02:54,742 --> 00:03:00,560
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, or if you want to make chocolate chip cookies you can use a substance other than chocolate.

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,868
Speaker 0: I'm not recommending anything horrible, but there are things.

51
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:04,915
Speaker 0: oop see that's not what I'm recommending.

52
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:05,437
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

53
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,446
Speaker 1: I'm quite sure What are you recommending then?

54
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,879
Speaker 0: or instead of a vanilla extract just use vinegar?

55
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,936
Speaker 1: But you only put in like one tablespoon of vanilla believe me.

56
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,648
Speaker 1: You'll know We'll have to test it out at plus.

57
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,843
Speaker 1: I don't want to waste a whole batch of cookie in the effort on Poisoning.

58
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:25,776
Speaker 0: well then you poison like five or six cookies And you keep them separate and then you put them on top whenever people.

59
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:26,560
Speaker 1: it's really hard.

60
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,730
Speaker 1: You kind of had to make it one batch at a time.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:28,810
Speaker 0: No.

62
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,980
Speaker 0: No you just soak them in vinegar or something oh And then let them dry and then put them back in on top when everyone comes over.

63
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:38,213
Speaker 0: So you can eat cookies out of it because you know the top layer is forsaken.

64
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,820
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a good one.

65
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:40,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course now.

66
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,759
Speaker 0: We just told everyone on the internet including most of our friends.

67
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,785
Speaker 1: Damn it however.

68
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:56,020
Speaker 1: It'll now be a test of which of our friends don't listen anymore and which of our friends You know we'll say something about the cookies or think about eating them or still eat them or not eat them.

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,980
Speaker 0: And yeah, I mean we don't care about all you real people who listen.

70
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,969
Speaker 0: We're trying to figure out which of our friends still listen.

71
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,220
Speaker 1: I could put in some sort of non tasting poison.

72
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:04,664
Speaker 1: See who eats them.

73
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,910
Speaker 0: what kind of non tasting poison?

74
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,520
Speaker 0: We're not trying to actually kill him this non tasting non-lethal poison.

75
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:15,636
Speaker 0: You're saying x-lax Whoo that's chocolate - that's a bad idea.

76
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:16,279
Speaker 1: It's like cookie.

77
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,245
Speaker 0: Alright, anyway.

78
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:27,842
Speaker 0: It is tech day so in the news this happened a while ago And I want to talk about it because it while the end result was effectively nothing it says a lot about the power of the Internet.

79
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:46,675
Speaker 0: Dell had this idea called idea storm or basically was dig on Dell's site And you could submit ideas like Dell would be better if they did blah or if they did X or if they did this Differently and then people could dig up ideas that they thought were good and Dell said that they would consider and act on whatever ideas Got dug up to the top.

80
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:56,891
Speaker 0: Pretty much as you could guess since this was on the internet and not in any sort of real part of the world Linux nerds found it and hammered it with cell Linux.

81
00:04:57,072 --> 00:04:59,720
Speaker 0: put Linux on your desktops Linux Linux Linux.

82
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:04,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see the big problem is and I just realized this recently when I was buying a laptop

83
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:05,963
Speaker 0: When you

84
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:13,877
Speaker 1: buy a computer that's already put together it usually has Windows on it or OS X But if you're buying a Mac, what are you gonna run besides OS X?

85
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,420
Speaker 1: What do you care?

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:23,672
Speaker 1: But if you're buying a PC you might be a Linux user or maybe you already own a copy of Windows that you bought in A box for your last computer or something like that.

87
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:24,957
Speaker 1: Maybe you use BOS.

88
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,185
Speaker 1: I don't know But you know.

89
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:31,720
Speaker 1: when you buy a computer if it has Windows on it already you're paying for that whether you know it or not.

90
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,760
Speaker 1: Now you're not paying the full 200 whatever dollar price, but you're paying for it.

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:47,499
Speaker 1: You know Dell pays Microsoft an amount of money for every computer that they install Windows on and as a result that must Increase the price of the computer the Dell sells to you.

92
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:54,620
Speaker 0: Yeah even though it is some trivial amount because Microsoft seems more interested in getting you to use Windows than getting money from you using Windows directly.

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:02,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you buy a copy of Windows at the store, it's like $200 but when Dell buys a copy of Windows It's like $20 maybe $40.

94
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,999
Speaker 1: It's not much but it's still there.

95
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:16,651
Speaker 1: so if you're a Linux user and you buy a computer that's put together this upsets you because you feel like I Should be able to buy a computer that's empty or maybe one that has Linux on it Where you shouldn't have to add anything to the price.

96
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 1: and why am I paying for Windows?

97
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,021
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna use.

98
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:31,220
Speaker 0: I see a whole nother layer here where in addition even if because Dell's responded the news here is that Dell actually responded to the Overwhelming demand for Linux and it was basically three or four paragraphs of corporate wishy-washy.

99
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:35,480
Speaker 0: We support Linux and blah blah blah and that's a good idea.

100
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:47,333
Speaker 0: Thanks for Colin kind of thing but what I'm getting the impression is that they said and this is very true that they don't want to support a Single distro because you know Linux people are no matter what distro you pick.

101
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:48,737
Speaker 0: you've pissed off 90% of Linux users.

102
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,560
Speaker 1: They should just sell freakin blank computers with nothing on the hard drive at all.

103
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:07,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but beyond that I see because they did talk about, you know supporting Linux and having certifications and I think one thing that Dell could do that would be really great is Instead of selling a Linux distro, maybe they'd have like one distro that they'll support.

104
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:13,680
Speaker 0: But if they sold computers, well, they'll certify and say that all the hardware here will work with vanilla kernels.

105
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:18,539
Speaker 0: or we've tested and these computers are certified to work with.

106
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,640
Speaker 0: 90% of the Linux is out there.

107
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:29,640
Speaker 1: Here's a list or better yet if they made a Linux distro that and custom and Configured it to a hundred percent work with all the features of the machine they put it on well.

108
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:39,199
Speaker 0: they also mentioned that they're working with Novell and I could see them making or working with them to have someone make a Dell Linux which wouldn't be that bad of an idea.

109
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:45,147
Speaker 0: I mean I would install Ubuntu because that's what I like but well I would buy a Dell anyway because that's not what I like.

110
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:49,766
Speaker 0: but for normal people if Dell supported it and had it there I think they could.

111
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:58,470
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not saying that this is some sort of altruistic thing I think Dell could make a lot of money because more and more especially with Vista I'm getting the sense that the mainstream world is.

112
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:04,400
Speaker 0: they're not necessarily mad about windows But they're starting to notice the bad press about windows.

113
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,400
Speaker 0: They hear about security problems and monopolies and things all the time and they wonder hey, isn't there something else?

114
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:18,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only other two things I got to say about this is you know This isn't a big deal for desktop machines because you can build a desktop computer that's blank.

115
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,820
Speaker 1: So it's not really a big deal that Dell doesn't sell blank desktops.

116
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,040
Speaker 0: Well, the only deal there is that you can't get a better computer if you get it from Dell.

117
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:33,200
Speaker 0: But a Dell computer for the same price often comes with a nice LCD and a bunch of extra stuff.

118
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:38,240
Speaker 1: Well, it's that if you buy a laptop, you can't make a blank laptop.

119
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:39,726
Speaker 1: It's almost impossible.

120
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:45,225
Speaker 1: all the nice laptops anywhere either have Mac OS Or windows on them.

121
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:47,712
Speaker 0: you can also need windows for some of their bullshit.

122
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's almost impossible to get you know.

123
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,670
Speaker 1: I mean sure there are laptops out there like IBM thinkpads where if you buy them and then you install Linux on them It'll pretty much just work 100% hell inside IBM.

124
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,503
Speaker 0: We had an official beta distro of Linux.

125
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:16,200
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't really say more than that that was made for the Lenovo thinkpads and work perfectly but almost nobody will sell you a Laptop with Linux or a laptop with that's blank or a laptop for you.

126
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Speaker 1: I have to pay the Microsoft tax and you know what?

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,920
Speaker 0: It's not like the companies are Evelyn.

128
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,360
Speaker 0: Oh, we will deny them Linux and it's probably not even that Windows or Microsoft is strong.

129
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:32,995
Speaker 0: I mean It's more that it is difficult to make certain laptop hardware work in Linux at all And it's probably just not worth the effort to them just sell a blank one.

130
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:34,220
Speaker 1: Why can't they sell it blank?

131
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,079
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.

132
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,342
Speaker 1: You know So I don't have to.

133
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:39,233
Speaker 1: and the thing is Dell actually has a laptop you can buy.

134
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:42,886
Speaker 1: I think it's either blank or with Linux Or with free DOS or something like that.

135
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:46,800
Speaker 1: and they actually charge more for the blank Linux non windows.

136
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,108
Speaker 0: Well, see now that's just silly cuz.

137
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,557
Speaker 0: then I'll buy the windows one.

138
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,399
Speaker 0: now I have a Linux license or a Windows license and I have the computer and it cost less.

139
00:09:54,961 --> 00:10:05,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see the thing is what they'll do is if they charge more then they'll put out a notice saying hey We put Linux on a laptop and it didn't sell as well as the windows one.

140
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,600
Speaker 1: you guys obviously were just lying.

141
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,592
Speaker 0: See the thing is I don't think Dell alone.

142
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,600
Speaker 0: they have no interest in pushing windows over Linux.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Speaker 0: They have an interest in selling computers as cheaply as they can to sell to a bunch of people to make a bunch of money.

144
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:22,845
Speaker 0: They work with Microsoft because Microsoft gives them a lot of incentive to work with them And that's where the money is.

145
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:25,340
Speaker 0: if the market changes the money's elsewhere.

146
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:31,780
Speaker 0: There's no reason Dell or any of those companies would continue to push Microsoft stuff without a lot of incentive.

147
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,670
Speaker 1: Well think about this, you know every.

148
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:40,876
Speaker 1: if they just want to sell more computers It shouldn't cost you anything to sell blank computers as opposed to ones with windows on.

149
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:50,020
Speaker 0: here's where it can cost you if Microsoft suddenly says oh well, uh, by the way, we have to raise the cost of windows to you for no particular reason.

150
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would just get with the suing at that point.

151
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people have tried that before.

152
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:55,139
Speaker 0: it is tough to do.

153
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, whatever Okay.

154
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:01,500
Speaker 1: So speaking of Microsoft they just egg way.

155
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:07,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, they just got put in court for the largest patent settlement in it.

156
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,442
Speaker 0: What was it like?

157
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,107
Speaker 0: 1.3 billion dollars?

158
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:18,259
Speaker 1: It was some ridiculous amount of money over a billion dollars for Infringing upon a mp3 related patent lawsuit.

159
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,503
Speaker 0: now Wait a minute Scott.

160
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:22,293
Speaker 1: doesn't Fraunhofer own the mp3 patent?

161
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:24,420
Speaker 1: Fraunhofer does own the mp3 patent.

162
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:29,039
Speaker 1: Well, the well, here's the thing cuz didn't Microsoft pay Fraunhofer something like that?

163
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:41,226
Speaker 1: The way what happens here is things like JPEG or GIF or mp3 or I don't know cell phone radios or All kinds of technologies.

164
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,160
Speaker 1: these days are so complex that they're not just covered by one patent.

165
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:49,338
Speaker 1: It's not like Edison where it was like I invented the light bulb one patent for the light bulb.

166
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,960
Speaker 1: or Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone patent for the telephone.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Speaker 0: Yep, like mp3 you love like the patent for the special algorithm and method they use and a patent.

168
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:02,719
Speaker 1: There'll be a patent for the encoding a patent for the decoding a patent for this.

169
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,481
Speaker 1: You know The.

170
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:08,980
Speaker 1: the encoder will have like five separate algorithms in it that go one after the other and two of them at the same time.

171
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,795
Speaker 1: That's like ten patents right there.

172
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,364
Speaker 0: now ridiculous That wouldn't be an issue.

173
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:16,200
Speaker 0: normally because you're generally one consortium or one company would own all these patents.

174
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,397
Speaker 0: So then you just have to pay them license fees in bulk and then you can use the thing.

175
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:20,478
Speaker 0: Yep.

176
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:26,900
Speaker 1: So for example, like HD DVD and blu-ray, those are there's consortiums around those things.

177
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,507
Speaker 1: You know a bunch of companies get together.

178
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:43,840
Speaker 1: they come up with some standard technology They get as many patents on it as possible and if you want to license that technology you license from the blu-ray consortium and Then they decide how they divide the monies among the consortium members

179
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:50,259
Speaker 0: Which while it's definitely a workaround of the fairly broken software patent system in the very least

180
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,640
Speaker 1: it

181
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,299
Speaker 0: Shields normal people in normal companies who just want to use technology from all that patent BS.

182
00:12:55,701 --> 00:13:10,803
Speaker 1: yeah, imagine what would happen if say let's say Sony and Toshiba which are like enemies, but let's say they got together and made a technology and Part of the technology is made by Sony and part was made by Toshiba and half the patents are on one side and half are On the other.

183
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:14,889
Speaker 1: well now if Sony wants to use technology They have to license those patents from Toshiba.

184
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,888
Speaker 1: and if Toshiba wants to use the license from Sony and if you want to use Technology now you have to pay both of them.

185
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,698
Speaker 1: You have to come up with two separate agreements the two separate companies.

186
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,687
Speaker 1: now Imagine if five companies made the technology together.

187
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:26,469
Speaker 1: It's out of control.

188
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,136
Speaker 0: So what happened with Fraunhofer and mp3?

189
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:33,369
Speaker 1: Well, basically everyone Everyone who knows anything about mp3s.

190
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:42,720
Speaker 1: if you wanted to license mp3 technology You would pay Fraunhofer because it was sort of assumed, you know By most of the world that Fraunhofer had all the mp3 patents.

191
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,666
Speaker 0: Well notice the word assumed this.

192
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,993
Speaker 0: the patent system is far too complex.

193
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:52,882
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah, well Loosen slash Alcatel.

194
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:55,240
Speaker 0: I'll tell I don't know Alcatel Alcatel.

195
00:13:55,601 --> 00:14:03,060
Speaker 1: I read the article slash Bell Labs slash Fraunhofer slash a bunch of companies when mp3 was made.

196
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:10,225
Speaker 1: There's been a lot of shuffling since then, you know and Fraunhofer is kind of its own thing now and Bell Labs Who knows who owns that?

197
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:19,140
Speaker 0: now this happens a lot in the technology sector where a company gets bought out and then split up and then the two split off parts get bought by two different companies and then a third company merges with one of them.

198
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,220
Speaker 0: and

199
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:35,180
Speaker 1: And every time companies split up and get together or get bought and merged You know all the patents belonging to the companies fly all over the place, you know like when someone lets go of a company they keep some of the patents and some of them get stay with the thing and Then someone buys it and they get all the patents.

200
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:46,060
Speaker 0: Yeah in the end There are a lot of patents out there that while someone will claim to have them The status is actually ambiguous and no court has said who owns it and no one actually agrees.

201
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:47,555
Speaker 0: It just hasn't come up as an issue.

202
00:14:47,838 --> 00:15:06,420
Speaker 1: Yep So the in the mp3 patent portfolio, which is all the patents that are for mp3 It seems like one of the patents may or may not have slipped through the cracks to loosen Alcatel which is the company that you know is some way connected to Bell Labs Fraunhofer or something.

203
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:16,536
Speaker 1: So they decided hey, we found this, you know some lawyer at loosen Alcatel said hey We got this one patent here that might be related to mp3 that fell through the cracks somehow.

204
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:22,614
Speaker 1: It's you know All those people who are using mp3 only paid Fraunhofer and they didn't pay us.

205
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,580
Speaker 1: Let's see if we can take them to court.

206
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,005
Speaker 1: Oh, I got an idea.

207
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:27,650
Speaker 1: Let's just go after Microsoft.

208
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,954
Speaker 1: That's a good one to go after.

209
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:31,302
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, let's go to Microsoft All right.

210
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:33,370
Speaker 0: Now Microsoft fry gets this and goes.

211
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:34,996
Speaker 0: what the fuck is this you Charles?

212
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:36,100
Speaker 0: I paid Fraunhofer.

213
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:42,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, uh-huh We had one of the patents that you know Fraunhofer needs for to get the all mp3 patent.

214
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:44,709
Speaker 1: Small part in a rash.

215
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:52,700
Speaker 1: imagine if like you had the telephone patent But I had the patent on the thing that turns the electrical signal into sound.

216
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:54,899
Speaker 0: Or if you had a patent on the buttons on the telephone.

217
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had.

218
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:58,560
Speaker 1: I had a patent on the layout of the buttons.

219
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:02,199
Speaker 1: So aha every phone with this layout of buttons must pay me money.

220
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:18,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, now furthermore you wait until everyone has a telephone and then suddenly you say by the way, I got this patent assholes Yep, so some judge who probably doesn't understand technology and is a dumbass Decided that Microsoft was the lose and that this patent was the real now.

221
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:19,660
Speaker 0: This is what bothers me.

222
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,959
Speaker 0: I mean Imagine if the world were run by common sense or if people just sat down and thought about it.

223
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:34,313
Speaker 0: Most people in the world who had anything to do with this industry agreed that the patent Liabilities were taken care of by payments to X company.

224
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,280
Speaker 0: people had been paying X company.

225
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,868
Speaker 0: There's great precedent that everyone had been paying X company.

226
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:40,112
Speaker 0: for why patent?

227
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:45,429
Speaker 0: suddenly someone comes along and says no I have the patent due to this loophole.

228
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:53,220
Speaker 0: It's like back in medieval times when someone would be like well, technically I'm the second son of the first Earl of the blah blah blah and therefore I am the real king of Spain.

229
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,645
Speaker 1: I really think about this.

230
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:57,135
Speaker 1: This isn't even a case like a patent case.

231
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:57,958
Speaker 1: That would make sense.

232
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,571
Speaker 1: Like aha I actually invented the light bulb a year ago, you know, I did something.

233
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,560
Speaker 1: I deserve the money for this invention because I'm the inventor.

234
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,367
Speaker 1: This is haha.

235
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,194
Speaker 1: I have a piece of paper.

236
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,480
Speaker 1: Give me a lot of money.

237
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,848
Speaker 1: It's basically you deserve nothing.

238
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:21,520
Speaker 1: You're just someone who came out of nowhere with a piece of paper Declaring that somehow some company that knows nothing about you owes you one and a half billion dollars.

239
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:25,160
Speaker 0: This is right down there with what Ram bus did with their Ram back in the day.

240
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,082
Speaker 0: Yeah Where they?

241
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:27,827
Speaker 0: the whole submarine patent issue?

242
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:34,549
Speaker 0: where you get a technology you work with people you give them technology And you don't really mention that is patented by you.

243
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,860
Speaker 0: you wait until they use it and then you sue everybody in the world.

244
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:43,600
Speaker 1: Well, well, hopefully this will go to a higher court who is not as dumb as this low court.

245
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:49,507
Speaker 0: I have a little bit of faith just because Microsoft has a lot of money and Normally, you know say Oh Microsoft.

246
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:50,793
Speaker 0: What's a few million dollars?

247
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:52,520
Speaker 0: This is way more money than that.

248
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,644
Speaker 1: This is over a billion dollars and it would have been according to the letter of the law The set.

249
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:05,360
Speaker 1: the amount of money could have been four times as much if Microsoft had willfully infringed the patent.

250
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:10,358
Speaker 1: So if Microsoft was purposefully infringing on the patent like we're gonna infringe on that patent.

251
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:10,920
Speaker 1: We don't care.

252
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,759
Speaker 1: It would have been like five billion dollars.

253
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:16,429
Speaker 0: Microsoft is not gonna take this sitting down.

254
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:21,525
Speaker 0: They're not stupid and it's weird that I have to read for Patent issue.

255
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:26,800
Speaker 1: I don't think about this though, right if the if they're suing you for a billion something dollars, right?

256
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:31,916
Speaker 1: That means spending a hundred million dollars on lawyers isn't a bad idea.

257
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:32,377
Speaker 1: Guess what?

258
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:33,200
Speaker 1: You're not gonna win.

259
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:39,100
Speaker 1: Microsoft can spend two hundred million dollars on lawyers and they'll still be getting a good deal on this one.

260
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:50,740
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone can beat two hundred million dollars of lawyers that basically like every lawyer in the world versus your one law firm Unless I mean got to see what law firm they'll have me for that much money.

261
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,559
Speaker 1: You could buy the patent office from the government and then go into the files and switch them around.

262
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,249
Speaker 0: Things of the day now.

263
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:13,040
Speaker 0: Scott was thinking about doing a theme week And I totally jumped on the bandwagon because I actually had one of the things he was talking about on my computer.

264
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:20,150
Speaker 1: basically, I remembered seeing or hearing I forget the Opener to Pokemon in Hebrew.

265
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:24,341
Speaker 1: now, I figured hey, that's pretty cool That makes a good thing of the day, you know Cuz?

266
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:27,980
Speaker 1: normally you only hear it in Japanese and English and I don't know.

267
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:37,765
Speaker 1: I guess some people from this, you know for I would listen to this podcast from other countries so they may or may not have seen openers to Popular shows in their native language.

268
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:39,289
Speaker 1: So all this week.

269
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:48,111
Speaker 1: I decided I'm gonna find some openers and maybe some other instances of cartoons or Popular shows of geeks.

270
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not gonna be just anime.

271
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, that are in various languages.

272
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:54,520
Speaker 1: cuz you know, it's pretty funny.

273
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,540
Speaker 1: I mean if you watch like Family Guy in Spanish Tomo Tomo Tomo Tomo Tomo Tomo Tomo Tomo.

274
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, quagmire doesn't say giggity-giggity He says doma doma doma doma doma doma doma.

275
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's pretty cool.

276
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:16,740
Speaker 1: So I went and I talked to some people like anime world order people and they suggested I give you the macaron 1 opener in Hebrew, it's pretty funny.

277
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:30,784
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny cuz the original opener to macaron 1 has like a robot voice that says well the English Opener not the Japanese opener has a robot voice that says mama mama mama mama mama Macaron one.

278
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:31,647
Speaker 0: it's kind of lame.

279
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:37,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the Hebrew one actually has a Pleasant woman singing the same thing.

280
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:40,767
Speaker 1: only she says Macaroni had.

281
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,198
Speaker 1: cuz a hard is one.

282
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:44,423
Speaker 1: It's a hodge time.

283
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:44,925
Speaker 1: Shalosh.

284
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:46,570
Speaker 1: I forget but that's one.

285
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:46,931
Speaker 1: see three.

286
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:48,535
Speaker 0: I learned that from Futurama.

287
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:49,137
Speaker 0: Yeah.

288
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:50,140
Speaker 1: Oh, that's true.

289
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where I learned that account a little bit in Hebrew.

290
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:54,717
Speaker 1: So it's pretty it's pretty fun.

291
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:55,680
Speaker 1: It's a good opener.

292
00:20:55,841 --> 00:21:01,682
Speaker 1: Oh and the first half of the opener has a lot of Hebrew talking and you can learn how to tell when I mean Hebrew.

293
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:07,640
Speaker 1: Hebrew is sort of a caveman language like the grammar is sort of like like if you want to say who is that?

294
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,437
Speaker 1: It's like he Atta which is pretty much like who that Atta.

295
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:16,472
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it's it's a caveman language, but you can.

296
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,680
Speaker 1: it's pretty interesting to listen to people speak it.

297
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,108
Speaker 1: So here's your chance if you've never heard.

298
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:28,531
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is it's always bothered me that they even bother to Localize and change the music like that in shows.

299
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,420
Speaker 1: I mean actually I think the Hebrew one is better.

300
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I agree actually.

301
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:49,496
Speaker 0: But just it's funny that like Sailor Moon when they brought it over to America They really tried to make it an American show and they tried to remove any reference that it was happening in Japan Despite the fact that there's a red and white Eiffel Tower in the background all the time.

302
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's that?

303
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,545
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's like they.

304
00:21:54,866 --> 00:21:58,160
Speaker 0: I mean the fact that they would still do it cuz a lot of modern shows they still do.

305
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,590
Speaker 1: It's like what I think kids are stupid.

306
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

307
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:04,613
Speaker 1: then again No Everybody knows you're not fooling anybody when you do that.

308
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:09,879
Speaker 0: then again when I was a really little kid There were cartoons from Japan that I didn't know were from Japan.

309
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:14,200
Speaker 1: Well, like I didn't know the cartoons were from Japan.

310
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:23,757
Speaker 1: But if the cartoon took place in Japan I totally knew you know and a lot of times the cartoons didn't actually take place in Japan or America.

311
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:34,855
Speaker 1: like Macross slash Robotech takes place on an island a random island and Like what else is a good one transformers obviously takes place in America.

312
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,158
Speaker 1: I mean look spike is so white You're not telling me the Japanese guy.

313
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,237
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know.

314
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:48,812
Speaker 0: Anyway back in high school when I got a hold of Japanese music because the internet started having MP3s on it and the first thing God the.

315
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:57,467
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into that whole story but one of the early songs I acquired was the Chinese opener to Sailor Moon and It was kind of weird sounding.

316
00:22:57,488 --> 00:22:59,320
Speaker 0: cuz I'd never heard Chinese music before.

317
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,462
Speaker 0: I just gotten used to Japanese music and now I hear people singing in Chinese and it sounded just really weird to me Cuz.

318
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:08,400
Speaker 0: back then I didn't even really watch or know about Chinese kung-fu movies.

319
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,214
Speaker 0: So I was doubly in the dark and I had it.

320
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:13,999
Speaker 0: and now that it's a thing of the day I think I wonder huh?

321
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:24,720
Speaker 0: I wonder if anyone's ever put this on YouTube and I don't look on YouTube and sure enough there are multiple Openers and closers to Sailor Moon in Chinese and I've linked to one of them is my thing of the day.

322
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole week.

323
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:28,898
Speaker 1: So watch out.

324
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:39,067
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway for anyone who listened to the most recent episode of this show the Monday episode that we did last which was what two weeks Ago, maybe I don't remember.

325
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:50,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, we talked about layers two and three, you know IP addresses and MAC addresses in layman's terms how networking works on that low level, you know There are five layers and TCP IP which is what you all use.

326
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:53,159
Speaker 0: and we talked about layers two and three.

327
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:55,954
Speaker 0: layer One is the physical wire, which you don't really don't care about it all.

328
00:23:56,618 --> 00:24:03,182
Speaker 0: tonight We were gonna talk about net which is that thing that you have and all your links as routers and almost all of you use It.

329
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:07,340
Speaker 0: you probably don't really know what it does You probably don't really care and we were gonna talk about that.

330
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Speaker 0: But then we realized that there's one critical thing that you have to understand before we can explain how that works in any real way.

331
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:20,688
Speaker 0: Thus tonight what we wanted to do is cover the next layers up instead of layers two and three We want to talk about layers four and five.

332
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,460
Speaker 0: now to refresher real quick layer two was MAC addresses.

333
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:26,986
Speaker 0: Layer three was IP addresses.

334
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:33,164
Speaker 0: layer four, which I'm sure you've heard this term before is what we like to call ports Mm-hmm.

335
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:46,040
Speaker 1: Well, basically Before you know about ports, which I'm sure you've heard analogies of ports that we are going to repeat to you pretty soon There are sort of things under ports that you have to know such as packets.

336
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:47,688
Speaker 1: No, what is a packet?

337
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,919
Speaker 0: last time we talked about IP addresses.

338
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:50,100
Speaker 0: now?

339
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,940
Speaker 0: Once you know someone's IP address, you're the stuff you were sending can be routed over the internet to that person.

340
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:59,255
Speaker 0: So the internet knows where to send your data.

341
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:04,433
Speaker 0: So if I ask for 129.21.21.1 the internet sends all my data there.

342
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,806
Speaker 0: now if this were a telephone system It would basically.

343
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:23,300
Speaker 0: well now it doesn't really work that way because it's digital but back in the day The telephone system would have a bunch of switches that would connect your phone Physically via one long switched wire all the way to that other phone and you just send data over what is effectively a long wire.

344
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,440
Speaker 0: It's like a permanent wire going between the two of you until you hang up.

345
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:27,727
Speaker 1: You know if you.

346
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,542
Speaker 0: well until you hang up, yeah, it's not permanent anymore That's right.

347
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:39,120
Speaker 1: You would dial a phone number and then there would be a physical wire Connecting you and another person a really long one on the phone poles.

348
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:48,159
Speaker 1: And that's why you would see all those old videos of the the phone operators Switching all these wires and different holes to physically connect to people.

349
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,480
Speaker 1: now If you are the only two people sharing a physical wire, you could just talk on that wire all day long.

350
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:59,360
Speaker 1: You can't talk to anyone else but you can talk to the person on the other end of the wire all day.

351
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,285
Speaker 1: You know, you're connected perfectly.

352
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:03,732
Speaker 1: You don't have to keep saying, you know who.

353
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:06,884
Speaker 1: you don't have to like say well No, it's like.

354
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:09,822
Speaker 0: you've probably heard of ISDN lines and all that I mean.

355
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:10,725
Speaker 0: on the phone system.

356
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:15,160
Speaker 0: you can set up even now a direct permanent connection between two points.

357
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,381
Speaker 0: It's as though a phone on one end called a phone on the other end and it's always connected 24/7.

358
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:21,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't have to.

359
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:28,420
Speaker 1: every time you say something on the phone You don't have to say who to send it to because there's only one way it can go the other end of the wire where?

360
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,026
Speaker 1: The listener is now.

361
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:39,761
Speaker 0: IP addresses theoretically could work in a similar way Where when you go to an IP address the internet would make a path a physical wire to connect the two points to send your Data,

362
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:43,697
Speaker 1: yeah, so if I want to visit dig they could have decided when they made the internet to make

363
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:44,400
Speaker 0: it - yep

364
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:54,939
Speaker 1: the way we're gonna do it is to make a tube between me and dig and I can talk to dig and dig can talk to Me over this wire and I can't talk to anyone else while I'm talking to dig unless I have more wires.

365
00:26:54,959 --> 00:27:02,280
Speaker 0: and That's how it works now considering how many computers there are on the internet this I think it's obvious why that fails miserably.

366
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would need so many wires.

367
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:08,995
Speaker 1: I mean imagine if a thousand people came to your website and you didn't have a thousand wires.

368
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:09,437
Speaker 1: Oops.

369
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,214
Speaker 0: Uh-oh So what we do now, we're not gonna talk about this in detail.

370
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:16,880
Speaker 0: We just need you to understand What this is on a basic level?

371
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,340
Speaker 0: We'll do a show someday about more details, but it's called packet ization.

372
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:23,208
Speaker 0: You don't send a straight stream of data.

373
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:33,440
Speaker 0: you send data in discrete things called packets little bursts of data Where you know exactly how big they are and they contain inside of them all the information to get from point A to point B.

374
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:41,619
Speaker 1: So instead of you know, I throw a wire to you and you grab it and then we talk You know with the two tin cans and we can't talk to anyone else.

375
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,340
Speaker 1: Basically we have these mailboxes and the mailman visits all the goddamn time and I you know I want to write you a letter.

376
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,386
Speaker 1: I write a part of the letter.

377
00:27:49,446 --> 00:27:50,713
Speaker 1: put an envelope write part of the letter.

378
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:51,959
Speaker 1: put an envelope write a part of the letter.

379
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,384
Speaker 1: put In the vote.

380
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:53,579
Speaker 1: I want to send a letter to someone else.

381
00:27:53,962 --> 00:27:56,898
Speaker 1: I put a different address on the envelope and I put a different piece of thing.

382
00:27:56,918 --> 00:28:11,524
Speaker 1: in there There's lots and lots of little bits of information that all get sent on their own To different addresses and they arrive at different addresses and you just mail them out and you get them in and then you sort them out once you get them.

383
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:19,894
Speaker 0: see now the mail analogy at least for what we're talking about right now is Extremely good and I recommend that you try to think of all of this in terms of mail.

384
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:21,579
Speaker 0: packets are envelopes.

385
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,551
Speaker 0: There's data in them, but the envelope as a whole is sent.

386
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:26,840
Speaker 0: You might have two different letters in the envelope.

387
00:28:27,142 --> 00:28:39,460
Speaker 0: You might have two different paragraphs on each page But no one cares about that because the envelope itself is sent as a whole from point A to point B. Now as a result, you don't need a specific path between any two points open all the time.

388
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:45,100
Speaker 0: You can just route the envelopes along the same paths and then branch them off with logic depending where they go.

389
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,159
Speaker 1: Yeah You don't know what the mailman is doing with your envelope once you give it to him and you don't know how the envelopes that Are showing up at your door got there.

390
00:28:51,662 --> 00:28:56,460
Speaker 1: All you know is that they did and they probably didn't go straight to where they were supposed to go.

391
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,480
Speaker 1: You don't think the mailman drove from your house to the other guy's house.

392
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,532
Speaker 1: He probably stopped at some other houses and dropped them off at a sorting facility And then they got sent somewhere else and then they got some somewhere else.

393
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 1: only they're doing it wicked fast.

394
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:14,030
Speaker 0: Yeah of light fast and you might send two letters to the same person and they both take two different routes But they both get there and they might.

395
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:15,620
Speaker 1: who knows what order they gonna get there.

396
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:23,455
Speaker 1: I could send you something yesterday and I could send you something today and the thing I send you today gets there right away And the thing I sent yesterday gets there tomorrow.

397
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:24,200
Speaker 1: Who knows?

398
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,246
Speaker 0: So alright back to the computer.

399
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,717
Speaker 0: realm then, you know, you're sending your data to an IP address.

400
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:32,652
Speaker 0: now I'm playing quake and I'm connected to a quake server.

401
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:34,660
Speaker 0: So I know their IP address and they know mine.

402
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,662
Speaker 0: So I'm sending data to them Packets.

403
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:38,590
Speaker 0: and they're sending packets back to me and everything's great.

404
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:41,220
Speaker 0: all the packets I get I send to the quake program.

405
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:43,610
Speaker 0: All the packets they get they send to the quake server now.

406
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:45,700
Speaker 0: What if while I'm playing quake?

407
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:48,675
Speaker 0: I also have AOL instant messenger open.

408
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,236
Speaker 0: now I'm getting packets to my computer my IP address my address which is the same for everyone.

409
00:29:54,277 --> 00:29:55,220
Speaker 0: It's like my street address.

410
00:29:55,741 --> 00:30:04,940
Speaker 0: I'm getting packets from AOL to my AOL thing and I'm getting packets from the quake server to my quake thing But they all arrive at the same IP address.

411
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:12,740
Speaker 0: How does my computer know to send the packet for the AOL thing to the AOL program and the packet to the quake thing?

412
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,943
Speaker 0: To the quake program.

413
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,549
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a good problem.

414
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:18,559
Speaker 1: I mean plus what if the quake server has say a web server on it?

415
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:26,060
Speaker 1: How does it not know not to send you web pages when you're asking for where the guy is or who you just fragged?

416
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:33,467
Speaker 0: I mean what if you have a computer that's running a web server and a file transfer server FTP and A jabber server?

417
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,540
Speaker 0: all the packets are still going to the same IP address.

418
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, one computer is usually one IP address.

419
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:40,511
Speaker 0: Now.

420
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:42,937
Speaker 0: The answer here is that there is another number.

421
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:43,860
Speaker 0: It's called a port.

422
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,000
Speaker 0: I'm sure you've heard of it before.

423
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:54,627
Speaker 0: I'm sure a lot of you have had a lot of problems Trying to make bit torrent work and it asks you to pick a port for something or you've gotten at and it says to open Up a port between two things.

424
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,536
Speaker 0: We're gonna explain what ports are.

425
00:30:56,596 --> 00:31:00,010
Speaker 0: their layer 4 They are the transport layer.

426
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:00,793
Speaker 0: see this.

427
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:02,400
Speaker 0: layer 2, you know the data link layer.

428
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,804
Speaker 0: You can link two computers together.

429
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:06,553
Speaker 0: layer 3 was the network layer.

430
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,860
Speaker 0: You can link two computers together over a network.

431
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,271
Speaker 0: They don't have to be in the same neighborhood.

432
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:16,714
Speaker 0: layer 4 You can link two programs together onto computers over a network through a data link.

433
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:19,060
Speaker 0: This is all accomplished with the port numbers.

434
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:27,341
Speaker 0: So when you connect to something You're not actually just connecting to the IP address if you own your web browser and type an IP address into it to get Somewhere.

435
00:31:27,903 --> 00:31:33,720
Speaker 0: it assumes the web browser that you want to connect to port 80 which is commonly the web port.

436
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:37,700
Speaker 0: It's the port where HTTP web pages are served or web servers run.

437
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:49,276
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean when you start your web server your Apache or your IIS or whatever program you have for the web server or Your web browser they just decide they're gonna use 80 as the port.

438
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:53,875
Speaker 1: However, you could very well decide that you're gonna use some other port.

439
00:31:53,916 --> 00:32:00,164
Speaker 1: you could tell your web server Hey web server, don't use 80 use 10,000.

440
00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:11,995
Speaker 0: so then anyone who wanted to connect to your web page would have to know that you're on a weird port and would have To tell the web browser or whatever they're using to connect Specifically to do go to that port because by default all web browsers go to port 80.

441
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:21,397
Speaker 1: Yep So even though your computer might have a web server running if it's not on 80 Then the web the web browser comes and tries to knock on door number 80 and nobody's home.

442
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:26,015
Speaker 1: and they you know They have to tell the web browser no knock on door 10,000 this time.

443
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:27,080
Speaker 1: That's where the web server is at.

444
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:33,900
Speaker 0: So say you got your envelope and the IP address is analogous to your house address And say you have three people living in your house.

445
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:36,189
Speaker 0: The name on the envelope is like the port.

446
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:41,779
Speaker 0: so it goes to my house the geek house And then it says rim on it, which means alright It is for port rim.

447
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:45,634
Speaker 0: It goes to the application rim as opposed to the application Scott.

448
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:50,459
Speaker 0: if you don't say what port Then it's not really gonna get anywhere because no one's listening for it.

449
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:58,212
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if someone sends a letter to our house that has our address on it, and it says for Joe Joe doesn't live here.

450
00:32:58,253 --> 00:32:59,140
Speaker 1: We're just gonna throw it out.

451
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, or ignore it or return it back to sender or something like that or like what if you know send something for rim.

452
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,624
Speaker 1: But rim moved out.

453
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:10,820
Speaker 1: there was a web server here a few seconds ago, but it crashed or it turned it off.

454
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:14,892
Speaker 1: Well now these goes in the trash just like the Joe's mail goes.

455
00:33:15,132 --> 00:33:16,476
Speaker 0: so you might have seen the notation.

456
00:33:16,617 --> 00:33:17,780
Speaker 0: typically people write ports.

457
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:23,026
Speaker 0: It'll be IP address you know number dot number dot number dot number Colon and then the port number.

458
00:33:23,347 --> 00:33:26,417
Speaker 0: that's what people usually do - I mean there are other standards.

459
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,099
Speaker 0: doesn't really matter.

460
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:40,500
Speaker 0: usually for most of your daily use you'll never even need to know what port because telnet is always on port 23 and all telnet programs assume that and SSH is always on its port and HTTP is always on its port and NTP is always on its port.

461
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:50,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, people have sort of decided like you know different programs will always you know They pick a port number when they make the program and then those programs seem to always use that same number.

462
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:59,533
Speaker 1: so 90% of the time you're not gonna have to know anything because the aim program Automatically connects to the aim server on the default aim port.

463
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:00,536
Speaker 1: it knows the number.

464
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:01,720
Speaker 1: I think it's hell it.

465
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,209
Speaker 0: I think it's six one seven, but I'm totally guessing.

466
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:05,273
Speaker 1: yeah, like.

467
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,076
Speaker 1: what's the like?

468
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:07,079
Speaker 1: all the half-life?

469
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,565
Speaker 1: Servers counter-strike servers yeah, yeah two seven nine one five Maybe I don't remember the number.

470
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:19,077
Speaker 0: see now luckily you out there for the most part Don't really need to know what ports you're using because that's all under the covers.

471
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:20,619
Speaker 0: It's all assumed It's all standard.

472
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:22,306
Speaker 0: You only need to worry about it.

473
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:26,797
Speaker 0: with things like bit torrent and net which we'll get to at the end of this episode Yeah, and net we'll get to another show.

474
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:33,179
Speaker 0: But alright, you know since we're talking about ports We can tell you a lot more about ports, and I promise we won't get technical.

475
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,951
Speaker 0: But a port is just a number.

476
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:36,440
Speaker 0: it goes next to an IP address.

477
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,072
Speaker 0: You know IP address is the address.

478
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:38,878
Speaker 0: port is the name?

479
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:51,087
Speaker 1: Ports range from zero to sixty five thousand five hundred and thirty five yep, so if you had 70,000 different programs you couldn't start 70,000 different web servers on your computer.

480
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:52,731
Speaker 1: eventually you would run out of ports.

481
00:34:53,112 --> 00:35:04,295
Speaker 0: this almost never happens because no one does 70,000 web servers on one computer yep, and even then there are ways around that Just in case anyone with technical knowledge is listening to this.

482
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:13,109
Speaker 1: They're crazy Interesting and mostly theoretical and then mostly not useful because who the hell has 70,000 web servers on one computer?

483
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,200
Speaker 0: however port multiplexing does have useful purposes But again, that's well beyond the scope of what we're talking about tonight.

484
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,340
Speaker 0: Yes, so ports range from that number to that number that big range.

485
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:29,564
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ports and much like member how IP addresses were way back in the day broken up into class a class B All the way through classy.

486
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:34,924
Speaker 0: well ports are broken up in a similar fashion the first 1023 port.

487
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:35,687
Speaker 0: well the first 1024 ports.

488
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:46,918
Speaker 0: so port 0 through port 1023. if you're wondering why these numbers are weird That's because they're in two binary their powers of two because computers like to think it powers the two.

489
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:56,320
Speaker 0: yep So those first thousand or so ports are you're known as the commonly used ports because they have been used for the same programs Pretty much as long as ports have existed.

490
00:35:56,601 --> 00:36:13,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is where you're gonna find all the really low numbers like your FTP your telnet your SSH HTML HTTP not HTML HTTP HTTP all the weird ones that no one uses like echo or character generator or daytime or Netcat.

491
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:15,470
Speaker 0: I think now these ports are special.

492
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,496
Speaker 0: now ports are regulated, but they're not.

493
00:36:17,737 --> 00:36:18,580
Speaker 0: there's no enforcement.

494
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:27,628
Speaker 0: It's not like you can go to jail if you use ports incorrectly, but by and large the world as a whole Recognizes and respects the rules for using ports.

495
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:33,891
Speaker 0: now that these first set of ports are special in a number of ways Aside from the fact that they're commonly known and they never change.

496
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:47,630
Speaker 0: so you know telnet will always be port 23 Most good operating systems and secure operating systems Linux's and all Unix's and all that will not yet Let a non super user put anything on those ports.

497
00:36:47,911 --> 00:37:01,690
Speaker 0: so a non super user cannot listen on one of those ports which adds a small bit of security to where you can trust that at least if you're connecting to one of those ports on a Machine a super user has blessed the usage of that port.

498
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:03,455
Speaker 0: now that is not always the case.

499
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:09,300
Speaker 0: in modern times and as Technologies advanced that is becoming less and less of a followed standard.

500
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:13,236
Speaker 0: But suffice to say that is an interesting thing that you might want to keep in mind.

501
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,140
Speaker 0: it might help you out someday.

502
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:21,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the idea is that you know a lot of the things you're gonna be doing on low-numbered ports like SSH is are Things that need to be secure.

503
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:35,000
Speaker 1: so if the person on the other end has something on port you know Port 22 the SSH port you can be kind of sure that what's on the other end is actually SSH and not some evil person up to no good.

504
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:38,708
Speaker 0: Yep, now beyond that these are all generally low-level things.

505
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:46,936
Speaker 0: no terminal servers character generators basic basic stuff the next setup Up until 12,000 and something I forget exactly what number is.

506
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:47,660
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter.

507
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:54,140
Speaker 0: Those are known as the registered ports or the allocated ports and these are the ones that use for most applications.

508
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,720
Speaker 0: You know quake 2 or half-life or aim or all these programs.

509
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,293
Speaker 1: You know your print server your samba or all that kind of stuff.

510
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:08,120
Speaker 0: They register with Various or odd bodies as to what port they want and it's semi regulated.

511
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,356
Speaker 0: There are a few conflicts here and there but for the most part.

512
00:38:10,397 --> 00:38:10,840
Speaker 0: It's solid.

513
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:18,844
Speaker 0: So if it's registered say I have a program called fubit and it does whatever it does it sends bits filled with ASCII characters That spell out foo.

514
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:19,948
Speaker 0: That's all it does.

515
00:38:20,952 --> 00:38:33,020
Speaker 0: if I get it registered to say port 2999 I don't know what's actually on port 2999 then generally anyone else who makes a program would never make their program listen on that port.

516
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:48,019
Speaker 0: That way when I have my program and you install it and run it I can make my program assume that little always listen on that port and anyone making firewall rules can always assume that anyone using That program will want to have that port open for incoming prep packets.

517
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:49,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we imagine this.

518
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:52,179
Speaker 1: imagine if there was no regulation at all, right?

519
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:57,037
Speaker 1: Now I run a program on my computer and I don't want to.

520
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:57,860
Speaker 1: I'm a dumb user.

521
00:38:57,981 --> 00:39:00,420
Speaker 1: So I don't know and anything about ports.

522
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:05,740
Speaker 1: I don't want to have to type in port numbers or manually configure port numbers for different things.

523
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:10,119
Speaker 1: So I just want to let everything decide what port to use on its own.

524
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:17,649
Speaker 1: so let's say I run a web server and then I run a quake server and The web server people never talk to the quake people.

525
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,678
Speaker 1: they both just decided to use port 80 on their own.

526
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:22,408
Speaker 1: now Don't we have a problem?

527
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:23,515
Speaker 0: Yes, we do.

528
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:33,228
Speaker 0: Oh shit See now that's another reason why originally and hopefully I don't know how long this will stick around but the first thousand ports or so are Special and only super users can mess with them.

529
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:36,280
Speaker 0: that very much limits the number of people who can cause a problem.

530
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:41,960
Speaker 0: More people can mess with the registered ports, but at least there's a list out there of what's on each port.

531
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:49,520
Speaker 0: It's also useful if you're doing debugging if you see a poor weird port number You can look it up and see generally what program would be listening on that part.

532
00:39:50,661 --> 00:40:03,680
Speaker 0: Now the final set of ports they're called the ephemeral ports or the dynamic ports are all the rest all the way up to 65,535. these ports are throwaways when it because remember you need a port on both ends much like an IP address.

533
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:13,298
Speaker 0: So say I want to connect to Scott's telnet server on port 23 So I have to send my packet from my computer and from a port on my computer.

534
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:19,280
Speaker 0: now I'm not going to send it from my telnet port port 23. because then how am I gonna get responses back?

535
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,219
Speaker 0: And how can I tell if those responses are someone else trying to tell that to me?

536
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,899
Speaker 0: Versus Scott's telnet trying to talk back to me?

537
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:32,022
Speaker 0: So what I do is I connect to Scott on his port 23 from my port Whatever.

538
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:39,348
Speaker 0: I pick a random ephemeral port like 43,000 211. there are algorithms for picking these ports.

539
00:40:39,428 --> 00:40:53,972
Speaker 0: usually the operating system or the stack will decide which port doesn't really matter But it'll pick a random port that nothing else on your computer is using and it'll send the message from that port To Scott's port 23. now Scott's telnet server sees this and knows all right.

540
00:40:54,453 --> 00:41:03,060
Speaker 0: any communication going back to this person will go to Port that whatever random port and that portal stay open until my conversation with Scott's telnet is done.

541
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:07,699
Speaker 1: It's it's sort of like if I want to send mail to someone just that just now.

542
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:10,571
Speaker 1: You know, I got to do something right now with that person.

543
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:12,620
Speaker 1: I business with them only for a short time.

544
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:27,200
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna temporarily open up this PO box over here with some random number and All the mail in this, you know particular item of business will be in this one PO box And so they know where to contact me and I know where to contact them and everything's cool.

545
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:29,308
Speaker 1: And then when I got business with them no more.

546
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:30,914
Speaker 1: I'll just close that PO box.

547
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,320
Speaker 1: I don't need it now.

548
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,670
Speaker 0: There's a lot more to this than all that.

549
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:36,900
Speaker 0: I mean we you've got the basics the port numbers.

550
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:37,817
Speaker 0: That's all you need to know.

551
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:40,848
Speaker 0: But the consequences of these ports are far-reaching.

552
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:48,720
Speaker 0: like you might have heard about firewalls people talk about having a firewall Very simply and very briefly just to get an idea of why ports are important.

553
00:41:49,203 --> 00:42:04,959
Speaker 0: If you make a firewall a basic firewall What it does is it looks at traffic coming in and in many cases It'll look at the port numbers and it'll say I will only let traffic coming in on ports 23 and 80 in and anything else will be blocked no matter what.

554
00:42:05,882 --> 00:42:13,868
Speaker 0: So knowing how ports work firewall operators can set up firewalls that will allow in traffic on ports They want and not allow in traffic on ports.

555
00:42:13,888 --> 00:42:17,820
Speaker 0: They don't want and yet still allow communication to take place in two directions.

556
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:26,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is how you can set up like your company's network to let your employees go to websites But not the use aim, you know to do stuff like that.

557
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:26,716
Speaker 1: Yep

558
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:41,992
Speaker 0: If you guys are interested again posting the forums we can talk in great detail about security and firewalls and all that business Stateful and stateless picks firewalls all the fun stuff, but that's well beyond the scope of tonight And I don't think anyone listening now really wants to hear it man.

559
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:44,040
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of stuff is way beyond our scopes.

560
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:46,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, suffice to say if you're interested keep letting us know.

561
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:53,256
Speaker 0: we're probably gonna do another series of everything We've been talking about these past few weeks one level of tech up from what we're doing now.

562
00:42:53,497 --> 00:43:01,152
Speaker 1: Yeah someday Anyway, the beginning of the episode or early in the episode we talked about how it's packet switching and routing.

563
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:08,080
Speaker 1: as opposed to the old style of Actual there is a physical wire between you and them switching and routing.

564
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,792
Speaker 1: This is what makes the internet awesome.

565
00:43:11,074 --> 00:43:17,156
Speaker 1: without packet switching The internet would be completely useless and none of the stuff we have today would exist.

566
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:19,346
Speaker 1: This is the fundamental Concept.

567
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:21,380
Speaker 1: that is why the internet is awesome.

568
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:27,720
Speaker 1: Now we also mentioned that you're putting stuff in envelopes and sending them to IP addresses and ports and you're getting stuff.

569
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:34,969
Speaker 1: But I said you don't know if stuff's gonna get here today or tomorrow when it's gonna get here What order it's gonna get there in.

570
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,459
Speaker 1: you don't know if it's gonna get there at all.

571
00:43:38,342 --> 00:43:39,566
Speaker 1: So what do we do about this?

572
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,312
Speaker 1: Well, there are two answers.

573
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:43,620
Speaker 1: one answer is you don't do anything about it.

574
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:46,315
Speaker 1: The other answer is you do do something about it.

575
00:43:46,617 --> 00:43:53,020
Speaker 0: now again We're talking about the way most of you use computers, which is with something called TCP IP, which is the stack.

576
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,960
Speaker 0: We're talking about, you know, I keep saying the layer numbers layer one, two, three, four five.

577
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,023
Speaker 0: We're talking about layer four.

578
00:43:58,064 --> 00:44:06,256
Speaker 0: now in TCP IP layer four is broken up into bit two Distinct protocols two ways of using ports.

579
00:44:06,779 --> 00:44:18,000
Speaker 0: now The only reason we're going to talk about this is because a lot of programs will ask for a port But they'll ask for a TCP port as opposed to a UDP port because there are in fact two different kinds of ports in TCP IP.

580
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:20,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, well when you make a port, well, it's sort of like.

581
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,520
Speaker 1: it's sort of like the same set of ports.

582
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:25,254
Speaker 1: But when you open up a port you have it either like doors.

583
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:34,611
Speaker 1: when you open one up You decide if it's going to be a TCP or a UDP port, you know You can't open up the same port as TCP and UDP at the same time.

584
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:37,280
Speaker 1: really that doesn't work, but you pick one.

585
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:39,286
Speaker 1: So sometimes you need both.

586
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:40,992
Speaker 1: you just open up two doors.

587
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:43,340
Speaker 1: One is the TCP door and one's the UDP door.

588
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,117
Speaker 1: So what is the difference between?

589
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,138
Speaker 1: TCP and UDP?

590
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,487
Speaker 1: UDP is the one where you don't care.

591
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:54,820
Speaker 1: if you open up UDP port you just send packets with addresses on them.

592
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,467
Speaker 1: You don't care if they get there You don't care what order they get there in.

593
00:44:58,568 --> 00:44:59,652
Speaker 1: you just send them.

594
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:07,819
Speaker 1: you send them all you want and sometimes You get some and when you get them you have to recognize that you don't know what order they were sent in.

595
00:45:08,402 --> 00:45:09,868
Speaker 1: You don't know if there are any missing.

596
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:11,032
Speaker 1: you just got them.

597
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:12,739
Speaker 1: Why would you want to do this?

598
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,129
Speaker 1: Well, there is a very good reason why you'd want to do this.

599
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,597
Speaker 1: Let's say you're using I don't know Skype.

600
00:45:19,902 --> 00:45:22,872
Speaker 1: Skype is a perfect example of why UDP is awesome.

601
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,839
Speaker 1: Even though it sounds like a pile of crap Why would you do that?

602
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,556
Speaker 1: If you're using Skype you're talking to someone you're turning your audio voice into bits and you set.

603
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:39,920
Speaker 1: you're turning the bits into a bunch Of packets and you just send them and if they show up in the wrong order Just throw out the ones that are in the wrong order.

604
00:45:40,314 --> 00:45:43,132
Speaker 0: Yeah Getting a port like playing a game too and a game of quake.

605
00:45:43,634 --> 00:45:53,917
Speaker 0: if a packet arrives late After you've already packed like say someone's shooting at you and one of the packets in that sequence is missing The game's gone on and now that packet arrives that data is already useless.

606
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:54,700
Speaker 0: You don't care anymore.

607
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,080
Speaker 0: You've already implemented whatever error correction algorithm or however, you're gonna deal with that problem.

608
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,813
Speaker 0: You have the information can't help now because the situation is already passed.

609
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:03,937
Speaker 0: You don't need that packet.

610
00:46:04,017 --> 00:46:04,880
Speaker 0: You don't want that packet.

611
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:06,997
Speaker 0: You don't want to respond to that packet or even look at it.

612
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:13,620
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, would you rather sit around like let's say I'm talking to rim on Skype, right and one packet gets lost.

613
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:19,580
Speaker 1: You want to wait around for that packet to show up again your Skype conversations gonna be all shaky.

614
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:39,770
Speaker 1: It's much better to just leave that tiny Nanosecond of audio, you know empty or just fake the quality of it and just keep going to get the conversation and the sound to just keep going and streaming so you can keep hearing something as You know, whatever packets make it make it cuz you know.

615
00:46:39,891 --> 00:46:44,106
Speaker 1: while you can't guarantee this stuff is gonna happen The stuff gets there.

616
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:47,660
Speaker 1: the internet is miraculously reliable in some fashion.

617
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:56,748
Speaker 1: And if you send a bunch of packets on UDP, you know, sure I guess it's possible that none of them could make it to the other side But for the most part they make it.

618
00:46:56,909 --> 00:47:00,340
Speaker 1: Skype works that the packets will get there and you can hear something.

619
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:02,087
Speaker 1: it's just if stuff's missing.

620
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:17,138
Speaker 1: that's actually better for something like Skype or Streaming video, you know, if the quality of the video goes down a bit or if half the video is missing for a second It's not gonna be much better than to have the video skipping and stopping and whatnot.

621
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:23,613
Speaker 0: now Let's say you are trying to send a file to someone meaning all the bits have to get there in order.

622
00:47:23,694 --> 00:47:26,746
Speaker 0: if any bit is missing the file is Garbage and useless.

623
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:28,900
Speaker 1: or let's say I'm sending an instant message to rim.

624
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:31,620
Speaker 1: I want the instant message to get there in the right order.

625
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,987
Speaker 1: I want to be sure it got there and I don't want letters missing in the middle of my instant message or else That's kind of useless.

626
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,618
Speaker 1: This is when you use the TCP.

627
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:51,753
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna tell you how the TCP does its tricks But basically by sending a lot more information in the packets and by Checking to make sure they got there.

628
00:47:51,773 --> 00:48:05,631
Speaker 1: you are Guaranteed that if you are connected to someone on a TCP port you are sort of guaranteed that either the connection is gonna stop working or The stuff is gonna get there in the order you said.

629
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:07,960
Speaker 0: now you might not care about all that.

630
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:12,640
Speaker 0: All you really need to remember is that there are two different kinds of ports TCP and UDP.

631
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:17,600
Speaker 1: Yep, TCP guaranteed to get there UDP not so guaranteed to get there.

632
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:24,020
Speaker 0: So of course in one last thing just so you're aware now UDP also Remember we talked about the layers quick refresher.

633
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:29,029
Speaker 0: You know layer one is the physical layer the wire Or the wireless or whatever physical way.

634
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:32,920
Speaker 0: you send the ones and zeros over space a wire up rims.

635
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,249
Speaker 1: But and then he yells the data out of his mouth.

636
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:35,570
Speaker 1: Yes.

637
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,236
Speaker 0: That's an excellent protocol.

638
00:48:37,437 --> 00:48:38,160
Speaker 0: It is quite fantastic.

639
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,880
Speaker 0: Layer two is the data link layer.

640
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,073
Speaker 0: That was Mac addresses is how two computers can talk over that wire.

641
00:48:44,495 --> 00:48:45,820
Speaker 0: layer three is network layer.

642
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,400
Speaker 0: Layer four which was talked about is ports.

643
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:50,760
Speaker 0: That's how you know, which thing to talk to on a computer.

644
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:55,180
Speaker 0: The last layer which you don't need to talk about really is layer five the actual program.

645
00:48:55,682 --> 00:49:01,825
Speaker 0: So if layer one is an Ethernet cable and layer two is you know Mac addresses link data link all that.

646
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:03,369
Speaker 0: layer three is IP addresses.

647
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,215
Speaker 0: layer four is a TCP port.

648
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:10,811
Speaker 1: layer five is my game of quake - yeah, it's a game of quake - it's Firefox.

649
00:49:11,012 --> 00:49:13,120
Speaker 1: It's aim that that's what it is.

650
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,123
Speaker 0: Yep, but remember the.

651
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:17,275
Speaker 0: the program itself is putting data in these packets.

652
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:18,700
Speaker 0: now we can put whatever data it wants.

653
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,674
Speaker 0: So a nice example here.

654
00:49:20,735 --> 00:49:34,240
Speaker 0: TFTP The trivial file transfer protocol is a file transfer protocol much like FTP file transfer protocol only much simpler Except to to skip over all the other interesting this of it because it's actually a very useful protocol.

655
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:37,230
Speaker 0: It's meant to be very light and it uses UDP.

656
00:49:37,692 --> 00:49:39,920
Speaker 0: You might wonder why on earth would he use UDP?

657
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,326
Speaker 0: How do you know the file got there?

658
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:53,217
Speaker 0: The answer is instead of letting the network stack take care of that the program itself puts its own data in the packet that it can then use on the other end to Figure out if everything got there.

659
00:49:53,762 --> 00:49:55,579
Speaker 0: Programs can do this on their own.

660
00:49:56,101 --> 00:50:09,084
Speaker 0: the thing is with these layers you can offload that to one layer lower than the layer you're working on and then not have to worry about it if you just want the data to get there and you don't want to have to sit there and write a way of Figuring out if the data got there.

661
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,458
Speaker 0: you just use TCP and it's all taken care of for you in a relatively efficient matter.

662
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:19,640
Speaker 1: or maybe You only care a little bit about whether they got there and not super a whole lot whether the data got there.

663
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:23,240
Speaker 1: UDP doesn't care at all on its own and TCP super cares.

664
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:33,432
Speaker 1: so if you care a little bit you can use UDP and then write your own thing that uses UDP and Cares only a little bit about whether the data got there or not.

665
00:50:33,753 --> 00:50:43,380
Speaker 0: now next week unless we come up with something Super awesome to talk about and also because this has been requested quite a bit now that we've done these previous two shows Anyone who's listened to both of them?

666
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,338
Speaker 0: You'll have enough of an idea of how all this networking stuff works to finally understand this.

667
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:55,060
Speaker 0: next week We're going to explain how net that thing on your linksys router that lets you have more than one computer on the internet works.

668
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:58,854
Speaker 1: Yep, it's called network address Translation.

669
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:06,076
Speaker 0: yes Which is in some ways almost a misnomer because it's actually usually pet or all.

670
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:11,411
Speaker 1: we won't get into that right now We're not gonna get into that, but there is a very important technology called net.

671
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:15,545
Speaker 1: that is very important to understand and also Without it.

672
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:16,309
Speaker 1: We'd be fucked.

673
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:27,720
Speaker 0: in addition to just talking about how it works We're going to talk about why it matters to you And how you can do that port forwarding business to make bit torrent work and also why you should probably have net even if you?

674
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,375
Speaker 1: Don't need the main purpose of it because it has other purposes.

675
00:51:31,516 --> 00:51:31,817
Speaker 0: Yes.

676
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:41,078
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

677
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,304
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

678
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:55,150
Speaker 1: be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com Where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

679
00:51:55,711 --> 00:52:01,370
Speaker 0: We say feeds plural because geek nights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

680
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:06,150
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays We have video games board games and RPGs.

681
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:11,610
