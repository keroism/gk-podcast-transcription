Speaker 1: no That's how you pronounce that shit.

12
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,529
Speaker 0: So I thought before I was thinking what can we do?

13
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:56,685
Speaker 0: because right now the vuvuzela is the thing like every Everyone in the planet.

00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:05,040
Speaker 0: I see there.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,923
Speaker 1: Well, they're not fancy.

19
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:10,980
Speaker 1: Some of them have pretzel in them and some of them are dark chocolate and also peanut at the same time.

20
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:15,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if the dark chocolate M&M is gonna be the best dark chocolate.

21
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,185
Speaker 1: It's you can tell.

22
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:21,840
Speaker 1: you can tell but it's not much different from the milk chocolate darker.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like oh that was slightly dark chocolate.

24
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,216
Speaker 1: Okay, great.

25
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:30,126
Speaker 0: I'll be honest I never liked M&Ms.

26
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,089
Speaker 0: what?

27
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,932
Speaker 0: even as a little kid.

28
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:33,176
Speaker 0: Will you stop the head?

29
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:34,500
Speaker 0: I never liked him.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,764
Speaker 0: I liked peanut M&Ms and like Reese's Pieces Fuck M&Ms.

31
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,196
Speaker 1: Well, these are peanut dark chocolate and also pretzel.

32
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:42,819
Speaker 0: So that's okay.

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,420
Speaker 0: pretzel I don't know about because that that just brings me back to combos, which I also hated.

34
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,260
Speaker 1: Oh combos are just so disgusting.

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,285
Speaker 0: But the thing I never understood.

36
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,580
Speaker 0: all my dumbass friends would have like a gigantic bag of those things.

37
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,988
Speaker 0: Them and bugles in their life every day.

38
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,633
Speaker 1: the thing I don't like about those.

39
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:57,837
Speaker 1: I mean the combo.

40
00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:58,820
Speaker 1: I like the pretzel part.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,198
Speaker 1: I just don't like the fake cheese part, but the same with the bugle the worst pretzel.

42
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:04,644
Speaker 0: It was nuts It was butts.

43
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,552
Speaker 1: No, but I mean, you know, the.

44
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:08,460
Speaker 1: the idea of pretzel is not a problem.

45
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:13,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the idea of shitty pretzel is a problem let alone shitty pretzel with fake cheese.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should have had.

47
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:20,246
Speaker 1: they should make a combo where the inside is not fake cheese, but is instead like Cupcake frosting.

48
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,242
Speaker 0: I remember I'd be sitting there and Chocolate.

49
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:26,131
Speaker 0: Hey, I'll trade you my great white for some combos.

50
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, how about that?

51
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,780
Speaker 1: an inverse peanut M&M, right?

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,828
Speaker 1: It's a pretzel and chocolate on the inside.

53
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,398
Speaker 0: What about a peanut injected with chocolate?

54
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:33,760
Speaker 0: somehow?

55
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:35,265
Speaker 0: Some sort of mutant peanut.

56
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,851
Speaker 1: You can't really hollow out a peanut.

57
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:37,974
Speaker 0: Okay.

58
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:38,597
Speaker 0: It won't be much.

59
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,560
Speaker 1: Here's what you could do.

60
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,460
Speaker 1: Right, you know peanuts usually come in a shell, but if you buy planners, they get rid of all the shells for you.

61
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:51,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah What if you made a chocolate in the shape of a full peanut shell and then you play?

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,119
Speaker 1: Inside where the two peanuts that are supposed to go in there?

63
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,349
Speaker 0: No No, you got to mix it up.

64
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,065
Speaker 0: if it's shaped like a peanut You don't want peanuts inside of.

65
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:00,791
Speaker 0: you want like capers or something just weird.

66
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,738
Speaker 1: Okay capers and chocolate.

67
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:03,220
Speaker 1: That's all you.

68
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,265
Speaker 0: But the vuvuzela.

69
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:11,380
Speaker 0: everyone knows about these things now, like they're popular culture even among people who don't care about sports or soccer.

70
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,825
Speaker 0: Notice my subtle joke there.

71
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:15,286
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

72
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,437
Speaker 0: So I was thinking what can we do now?

73
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,420
Speaker 0: Because if you make a joke about them like this like late show people are gonna be making jokes about these things like their pop culture.

74
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,950
Speaker 0: Someone's got to bring one of these things to a fucking golf game.

75
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,210
Speaker 1: Golf game.

76
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's a round.

77
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:35,223
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call it a game because I don't like golf.

78
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,250
Speaker 0: Okay plus alliteration.

79
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,110
Speaker 0: Don't you prefer alliteration golf game as opposed to golf match GM?

80
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:43,407
Speaker 1: No, that's not.

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,100
Speaker 0: Hey, let's go play a game of golf.

82
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,396
Speaker 1: That's different.

83
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,424
Speaker 0: I've never played golf.

84
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,249
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

85
00:03:51,711 --> 00:04:04,119
Speaker 0: Plus we say a game of putt-putt With the club at a hole And usually our scores are worse.

86
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:06,350
Speaker 1: it's it's what are you talking about?

87
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,561
Speaker 0: Well, if you average the front row crew, they're much worse.

88
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:18,546
Speaker 1: Okay, I was gonna say like The average like score you're gonna get playing around a putt-putt is gonna be a lot better than the score You would get playing actual golf.

89
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:18,928
Speaker 1: I don't know.

90
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,240
Speaker 0: I feel like with a lot of the people I play putt-putt with.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,549
Speaker 0: maybe it's just because I played it a lot more as a Kid, but I know a lot of people where the an average of an entire group would be six.

92
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:33,254
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's say you are playing Golf right.

93
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:34,759
Speaker 1: golf has 18 holes.

94
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, there's a some par threes fours and fives.

95
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,529
Speaker 1: So we'll say average of par four, right?

96
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:50,540
Speaker 1: So four times 18 is what 80 minus 18 times 2 is 16. easy answer to 64.

97
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,227
Speaker 0: the average score among most people who play putt-putt is gonna be 18 to 5 times.

98
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,134
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, right.

99
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:04,651
Speaker 1: so 18 times 6 right is what is worse than 18 times 4.

100
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:04,952
Speaker 1: Yes.

101
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:05,413
Speaker 1: Okay.

102
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:11,130
Speaker 1: So the thing is if you play if you're playing right regular old golf on an actual golf course.

103
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:14,740
Speaker 1: Right, you think you're gonna get it in the hole in six.

104
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:15,943
Speaker 0: It depends.

105
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,548
Speaker 1: No, not even close.

106
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,290
Speaker 1: You're gonna hit it.

107
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,230
Speaker 1: It's gonna go in the tree and you're gonna hit it.

108
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,230
Speaker 1: It's gonna go in the water if you're even lucky to even hit it anywhere near straight.

109
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,418
Speaker 1: But anyway, we're gonna go in another tree.

110
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:27,784
Speaker 1: They're gonna take a drop all my.

111
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,550
Speaker 1: you're gonna get like tens and 12.

112
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:39,618
Speaker 0: I feel like the way to make the vuvuzela Awesome right now is to bring it out in grossly inappropriate Context all the time.

113
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:45,652
Speaker 1: Well, I think you know, pretty much what's gonna happen is the vuvuzela is gonna be banned Everywhere.

114
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:49,625
Speaker 1: we already banned it like every soccer was banned at Wimbledon.

115
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:53,375
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's gonna be banned in like We can make some bank.

116
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:56,564
Speaker 0: we got to make a sniper rifle vuvuzela.

117
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:58,870
Speaker 0: that like breaks down into parts or collapses.

118
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,518
Speaker 0: So you can stick that in your pocket.

119
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,130
Speaker 0: You're sitting there Tiger Woods is up against Nicholson.

120
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:04,375
Speaker 0: They're about to do some things.

121
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:11,802
Speaker 0: you turn around you go go 13 it and then vuvuzela And then they just grab you and kick you out.

122
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you're banned forever.

123
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,112
Speaker 0: That's fine.

124
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:17,003
Speaker 1: You wait till hole 17 and you paid how much money for that?

125
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,409
Speaker 0: It might be worth it.

126
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:19,713
Speaker 1: It's all you.

127
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:24,287
Speaker 0: if you never want to go back there's no reason not to get kicked out of any event.

128
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:30,529
Speaker 1: at the very end At the very oh, you're gonna wait until the very very end to whip it out.

129
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,820
Speaker 0: I have one other phrase for you.

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,537
Speaker 0: This won't frighten you because we might not be going but Animacons, they're gonna sneak him in.

131
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,104
Speaker 1: No, they're gonna ban them.

132
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,530
Speaker 0: I know they are but they're gonna sneak him in.

133
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:51,564
Speaker 1: People just Right 26,000 people.

134
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:58,110
Speaker 0: even if they eliminate 99% of the vuvuzela as they get in the door, you're gonna get some vuvuzela.

135
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:09,769
Speaker 1: The problem is right is let's say banning a vuvuzela is really really really easy Unless anyone who uses it, it's gigantic, right and anyone who uses it.

136
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:15,249
Speaker 1: You can find them immediately because they're making a really loud noise and they can't really get away from you.

137
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:16,839
Speaker 0: The other way to go right.

138
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,670
Speaker 0: so we've got to make the collapsible ones.

139
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,989
Speaker 1: Their only hope is to abandon their vuvuzela and run and blend into a crowd in which case you win.

140
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,059
Speaker 1: now They're vuvuzelous.

141
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,170
Speaker 0: You got to plan this out.

142
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:40,749
Speaker 0: You got to have the I am Spartacus situation where you vuvuzela and while they're coming to get you someone on the other side vuvuzela Or in public places you just flash mob it and then disappear.

143
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could definitely do a flash mob.

144
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,355
Speaker 0: You know people are hanging out like having lunch in one of those parks in Manhattan and suddenly there's like a hundred people Vuvuzelous for like I did.

145
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:52,241
Speaker 1: I did see a video of a flash mob.

146
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:57,542
Speaker 1: a whole bunch of people went down to like an amateur Soccer match like oh, that was awesome.

147
00:07:57,723 --> 00:08:07,316
Speaker 1: And they just filled the stands Smoke bombs and then they got you know, they got naked and streaked across the field and That was pretty good.

148
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:15,870
Speaker 1: I like how the players and the refs tried to fight it at first Like a whole bunch of people to show up at like a little league and do that same thing even with the streaking and everything.

149
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,812
Speaker 0: see the thing Really?

150
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, those people would get on the sex offender list would be so awesome.

151
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,705
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be me some other guy that wouldn't be you.

152
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:25,730
Speaker 1: he wouldn't know any better.

153
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,281
Speaker 0: See I real.

154
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:32,551
Speaker 0: but again The only reason this isn't gonna happen and we can never do an awesome thing with these things is that no one knows how to Fucking.

155
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,596
Speaker 0: use them in America.

156
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,063
Speaker 1: Yeah people know how to use.

157
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,429
Speaker 0: they're gonna just put their mouth up to it.

158
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:45,479
Speaker 0: Almost feel would be funnier if you didn't actually blow in it You're just yelling vuvuzela through it like it's.

159
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,449
Speaker 1: I think I think people would figure it out.

160
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:48,818
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard to do.

161
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:50,269
Speaker 1: it's not that hard to do it.

162
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:56,050
Speaker 1: See here's the thing right is that you you're you're making a lot of assumptions because you are a trumpet person.

163
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:03,590
Speaker 0: Right, basically the vuvuzela is constructed in such a way that basically all you know It's harder to keep to make a tone in that than in a trumpet, right?

164
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,172
Speaker 1: And here's the.

165
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,420
Speaker 1: this is this is the very problem with the.

166
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,858
Speaker 1: if you had one and you played into it with your trumpeting Skills, it would actually sound pretty good.

167
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:19,409
Speaker 1: The reason it sounds the way it does because everyone basically just looks and When you go into a vuvuzela, it makes that noise that it makes.

168
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:24,050
Speaker 0: well Actually, it really can only make a really flat like B flat.

169
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the noise it makes and all you have to do is go which everyone in there and their mother can do.

170
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't actually have to have a quality armature or anything going on.

171
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:44,710
Speaker 1: And if you do have a quality armature, then it would sound good It would actually make a solid note, let me tell you my vuvuzela which I called it a stadium horn.

172
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:49,589
Speaker 0: That thing did not make a pleasant noise about how good a trumpet player you are.

173
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:54,713
Speaker 1: Well the ones that from what I've heard the ones that they have down there That's how they work is.

174
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:59,630
Speaker 1: you basically need no skill whatsoever to get it to emit the droning noise.

175
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,619
Speaker 0: You have to at least figure out you have to go.

176
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,110
Speaker 1: everybody knows you don't even know you had to go.

177
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:09,241
Speaker 1: Just you don't even need to go, you know You have to get the resonance.

178
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:16,764
Speaker 0: I can show you You don't everyone Physics if it makes a sound at all, you're getting the resonance if you're not.

179
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,741
Speaker 0: if it if you don't make the resonance It won't make enough noise for anyone to hear.

180
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:28,830
Speaker 0: from what everyone is told I know you're saying just go and it works but it had but unless you get the resonance it won't make any noise.

181
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:42,070
Speaker 1: Well, it seems to be that it's incredibly easy to use because thousands and thousands of non musicians are able to make it make No in a place with no training whatsoever place where apparently it is the most popular pastime instrument and sport.

182
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,940
Speaker 1: You know, they've only been around since like Oh one.

183
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,988
Speaker 1: It's not like an old pastime Yeah, it's like, you know, I remember I was at.

184
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:58,450
Speaker 0: you know the stadium soccer games I go to was a kid right and they sold him and My brother and I got him because we were both trumpet players and we were in the crowd's basically being obnoxious.

185
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,310
Speaker 0: Everyone else bought him and hardly anyone was able to make him make a noise.

186
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:08,410
Speaker 0: I guess I just I don't have a lot of confidence in the average American to make a sound out of a booboozilla.

187
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,439
Speaker 1: You know, that's just That's just you.

188
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,329
Speaker 1: All right.

189
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,707
Speaker 0: So got anything to talk about like Mexico and Spain and France and North Korea and soccer.

190
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,750
Speaker 0: that I don't watch so much.

191
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,898
Speaker 0: But I watched the game between Mexico and France.

192
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,400
Speaker 1: I don't know.

193
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,946
Speaker 1: I mean the World Cup is we got?

194
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,253
Speaker 1: see I'm 20.

195
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:31,388
Speaker 1: So there's been a lot of World Cups in my life But the only one I ever paid any attention to it all was when it was actually in the u.s.

196
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,950
Speaker 0: The long time ago, this is actually the first one I paid attention to only because I have a lot of foreign-born co-workers.

197
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,552
Speaker 0: So they're all really.

198
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:42,670
Speaker 1: the only reason I'm paying attention to it so much is because it's actually available for watching.

199
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,703
Speaker 0: You know easily aren't you using a pirate stream though?

200
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,873
Speaker 1: Well, I'm using a pirate stream But it's also.

201
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:50,985
Speaker 1: there's a some free Spanish streaming on Univision.

202
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:51,246
Speaker 0: Is it?

203
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:52,090
Speaker 0: Okay for you?

204
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,630
Speaker 1: It's also on ABC which I get for free.

205
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,970
Speaker 0: Is it okay to use the pirate stream if a legitimate stream of the same thing was technically already available to you?

206
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,867
Speaker 1: Anyway, the pirate stream is in English and the Spanish one is not.

207
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:09,527
Speaker 1: so You know, I mean as far as I'm concerned, it's always okay to use a pirate stream.

208
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,170
Speaker 1: Why would it not be?

209
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:11,683
Speaker 0: Okay, I feel like it.

210
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:15,964
Speaker 1: this world They're not gonna charge you money if I go down to the bar and just sit there.

211
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:21,569
Speaker 1: right the bar won't even you know Technically can't force me to even buy a drink and can't kick me out just for sitting there.

212
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,596
Speaker 0: Well charge you a cover.

213
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,021
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they don't.

214
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,630
Speaker 1: they say there's a guy out and he sees like free admission.

215
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,038
Speaker 1: Come on in free admission, right?

216
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,170
Speaker 1: So I could just do that.

217
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,090
Speaker 1: So why would it be illegal for me to just do the same thing in my apartment?

218
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,602
Speaker 1: Not anyone any money it is but actually it's not.

219
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,730
Speaker 1: I don't think it's illegal for me to watch the pirate stream.

220
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:49,382
Speaker 1: It's illegal for the pirates to pirate the stream because they are Re-broadcasting without the expressed written consent in all the stuff so far.

221
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:56,567
Speaker 0: No one has ever made a successful lawsuit for Using pirated media in that fashion only for distributing.

222
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,510
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

223
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,158
Speaker 1: So these guys and I know they're in Florida in California because I can see their local cable TV commercials You pay for the pirated stream.

224
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,486
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure now you're breaking straight-up law.

225
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:08,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not paying for it.

226
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,094
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but it doesn't matter Accepting money for the pirate stream.

227
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:16,522
Speaker 0: if you were pirating a pirate stream that was pay.

228
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:29,969
Speaker 1: I Think we need to do the Simpsons strategy with a barge that has major league rebroadcast major league baseball without expressed written consent and only implied verbal consent.

229
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:33,849
Speaker 1: So our implied oral consent.

230
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:44,938
Speaker 0: Well, one of my co-workers the other senior guy in my office right like we sit back to back and he's you know French and he expected France to beat Mexico obviously, but he doesn't expect No, but he did.

231
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,162
Speaker 0: he was like, yeah France isn't gonna win.

232
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:46,924
Speaker 0: you were doubting l3.

233
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:52,110
Speaker 0: They're not high in my bracket They're gonna choke because they're playing all defensively and bullshitty and whatever.

234
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:57,530
Speaker 0: So I walk out of the office and I'm you know, standing with someone else talking and I see Mexico score.

235
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:01,143
Speaker 0: I'm like, huh, and then I see Mexico score again a little while later.

236
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,150
Speaker 1: So that was a while later.

237
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I was out of the office for a while.

238
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:10,742
Speaker 0: So I walk back in just after this and I looked at him and I just played dumb and I was like Hey, it looks like France is up to nothing.

239
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,170
Speaker 0: Hey, isn't this awesome?

240
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,458
Speaker 0: That's the best I could do.

241
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,289
Speaker 0: I don't have any humor to make with the World Cup.

242
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:20,310
Speaker 1: No, all the humor is in the in the vuvuzela.

243
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:26,831
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that the World Cup will be like ten times more exciting once we're in the round of 16.

244
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:36,783
Speaker 1: You know the the group rounds, you know, there's some excitement like, you know Spain going down big surprise Stuff like that North Korea's goal, you know North Korea.

245
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:38,910
Speaker 1: It's like I. it's such a weird thing.

246
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,045
Speaker 1: It's like I'd obviously don't want them to win because that would be like but I want those players like.

247
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:46,682
Speaker 1: it's like I sorta I sort of feel bad for the North Korean players.

248
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,330
Speaker 1: It's like are they bad guys?

249
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,414
Speaker 1: Probably not.

250
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:54,559
Speaker 1: Well, the worst thing is I mean, they're sort of bad because I mean I'm sure that they're well-fed when the rest of the country isn't.

251
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:55,764
Speaker 1: so that's sort of.

252
00:14:55,884 --> 00:14:57,550
Speaker 1: but at the same time do they even know?

253
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,397
Speaker 0: They're shielded from all that who knows?

254
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,907
Speaker 1: but they're obviously not bad people right?

255
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,274
Speaker 1: They're not evil dudes They're not looking to hurt anyone.

256
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:08,662
Speaker 1: They're clearly robots and you know, they're just.

257
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:10,690
Speaker 1: it's not their fault that they were born in North Korea.

258
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:15,509
Speaker 1: You know, they could have been born anywhere, you know, it was just born.

259
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:21,506
Speaker 1: So, you know, they're just playing to be a sport just like everyone else, you know, they're.

260
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,750
Speaker 1: you know, they're not being bad.

261
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:29,850
Speaker 0: I don't want them to win because I don't want North Korea to have that feather in his cap But I want them to score meaningful goals.

262
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,954
Speaker 1: Well, I'm pretty sure they're not getting out of the the group round So it doesn't matter.

263
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:39,606
Speaker 0: actually what I would I would really hope for I know won't happen is if somehow They would all just be like we're not coming back.

264
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,049
Speaker 0: We defect.

265
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:47,387
Speaker 1: Well, I think that some of them like like two or three of them actually You know work.

266
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:53,730
Speaker 1: They're like play on real soccer teams Like and I think some one of them plays in like the Japanese League and stuff like that.

267
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,925
Speaker 1: So these guys aren't you know, like trapped in North Korea necessarily.

268
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,393
Speaker 0: They probably a family I mean most of them are.

269
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:01,978
Speaker 1: one interesting thing though.

270
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:08,694
Speaker 1: Is that you know, a lot of these others pretty much all the soccer teams Like for example the US team right.

271
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,620
Speaker 1: those guys don't really play as a team very much.

272
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:27,050
Speaker 1: They usually they're a bunch of you know, they play in MLS they play in European League They play wherever they play and then when it's time to do some US stuff, you know, like Confederations Cup or whatever You know, they all get together and they they play like that.

273
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,658
Speaker 1: So the thing is the North Korean team.

274
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,230
Speaker 1: the vast majority of the team actually plays together a lot.

275
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:36,643
Speaker 1: So if you compare them to the other teams you they actually have more.

276
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:47,869
Speaker 1: they're more unified and the you know More teamwork going on than pretty much anyone else still doesn't make up for the lack of talent but You know teamwork it counts for something.

277
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:54,311
Speaker 1: and you know If the team's with a lot of talent like Spain right had some huge teamwork going on They could.

278
00:16:54,532 --> 00:17:00,310
Speaker 1: they would probably be like way more dominant and you know, not losing it a big upset the Switzerland.

279
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:13,490
Speaker 0: So before we get to cosmos things of the day, I don't know how long it'll be before this gets taken down.

280
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:20,010
Speaker 0: If it's not there by the time you click on this, I'm sorry, but I will never tire of watching downfall parody videos.

281
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:20,993
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

282
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:24,250
Speaker 0: I feel like I have to watch this movie because it looks like it's an amazing movie.

283
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,950
Speaker 0: It's an amazing movie.

284
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:26,765
Speaker 0: I've never seen it.

285
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:33,707
Speaker 0: But that scene is just so powerful and when juxtaposed with Hitler complaining about the vuvuzela.

286
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:37,398
Speaker 0: I Laughed out loud like three times during.

287
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,346
Speaker 1: I wanted to you know, make my thing of the day.

288
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,310
Speaker 1: vuvuzela jokes.

289
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:44,129
Speaker 1: You know cuz there's so many good ones like the haters gonna have.

290
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:50,725
Speaker 1: And the And the music note the music sheet one, this is the one note.

291
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:51,306
Speaker 1: go right.

292
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,530
Speaker 1: so this is plan.

293
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,090
Speaker 1: What does the website you can go to that will add a vuvuzela to any website?

294
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,610
Speaker 1: There's a lot of good stuff out there and it the joke itself is not funny.

295
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,210
Speaker 1: But the clever, you know, it's it's the the cleverness of how you tell the joke, you know what it is.

296
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:14,678
Speaker 0: It's like the aristocrats or it's like the old Photoshop Fridays like the originals like here's a picture of four nerds And then everyone just like use.

297
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:17,830
Speaker 0: it's like variations on a theme like everyone has the same theme.

298
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,346
Speaker 0: What can you do with it?

299
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,070
Speaker 1: Some.

300
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:25,470
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for someone to make the vuvuzela video game like a playable game and all you do is push a button.

301
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,214
Speaker 1: and it was Text adventure.

302
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,201
Speaker 0: you have found a vuvuzela or?

303
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:55,122
Speaker 1: no, they should add in FIFA 20 You get from EA Sports, right you go in the options menu and this volume and it's like music volume sound effects volume announcer volume vuvuzela volume and the vuvuzela volume meter is three times longer than Anyway, so for a thing of the day.

304
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,390
Speaker 1: instead, I've got this video.

305
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,170
Speaker 1: I found this is actually I think a quality thing of the day because usually we find a thing of the day from some blog.

306
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,790
Speaker 1: Right, so we'll find a link on Boeing Boeing or a link on Kotaku or a link on College Humor to something else.

307
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:12,010
Speaker 1: This was I found it directly on YouTube itself.

308
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:15,180
Speaker 1: There was not a link from anywhere else except for the YouTube homepage.

309
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,470
Speaker 1: And what this is is the case of the poopy Nintendo.

310
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:23,305
Speaker 0: Oh my god, that was one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.

311
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:29,549
Speaker 1: It's it's basically a mystery of a Nintendo with poop.

312
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:42,210
Speaker 0: Another case this guy solves the mystery the telling of the story in this one and especially the diagrams As to whether or not it was feasible for one of the suspects to have poopy to the Nintendo.

313
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,995
Speaker 1: Yes, no court cases.

314
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:46,659
Speaker 1: It is really necessary here.

315
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,112
Speaker 1: You know, it's a pretty much cut and dry or cut and mushy Situation.

316
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:52,935
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

317
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:56,690
Speaker 0: I can't imagine I would have had that been me and I went to play a game first.

318
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,183
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have noticed I would have put a game in it wouldn't have worked and I would.

319
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:03,024
Speaker 0: but that's the brilliance of the Nintendo poopy.

320
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:08,470
Speaker 1: But what if the thing is top loader has a poopy shield, yeah, it does but you can't.

321
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, no way but think of this.

322
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,428
Speaker 0: Here's here's the brilliance of the poop plan, right?

323
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if they even thought of this but it's a brilliant brilliant plan.

324
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:22,546
Speaker 0: So I go I stick Super Mario 3 in the Nintendo and it doesn't work which happens.

325
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:23,710
Speaker 1: So what do I do?

326
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,492
Speaker 1: I pull it out.

327
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:25,777
Speaker 0: I put the game.

328
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,309
Speaker 0: I've just put in right up against my mouth to go.

329
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,910
Speaker 1: Well, you would notice when it didn't pop right out cuz it was all stuck and squishy.

330
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:35,075
Speaker 0: Well, I don't think it would get stuck.

331
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,928
Speaker 0: I think it would pop right out and I wouldn't notice right to the mouth.

332
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:49,118
Speaker 1: And then you know the breathe in what the fuck Poop your face dude, if she gets it, we should sell.

333
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:51,565
Speaker 1: who was halas and put poopy in them.

334
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:52,929
Speaker 1: and then when someone?

335
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:03,350
Speaker 0: Actually, the super soaker is the best way to end the vuvuzela thread you just shoot it right up the the muzzle.

336
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:07,285
Speaker 1: There has to be something you can do to get it up.

337
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:14,267
Speaker 0: Anyway, like I said a gentle love tap to the end of the vuvuzela will cause severe extreme pain in the wielder.

338
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:17,154
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Really cuz.

339
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,330
Speaker 1: I mean like you can put a mute on a trumpet and it's like whatever.

340
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:21,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mute holds it in.

341
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,646
Speaker 0: I'm talking about tapping it like bop.

342
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,345
Speaker 1: Oh Basically punching them in the face basically a stick via the vuvuzela.

343
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:34,482
Speaker 0: I said, okay It's like who wouldn't to vuvuzela, whatever the meta moment.

344
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,284
Speaker 0: Would you get into it?

345
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,390
Speaker 0: Oh, this is a book club episode.

346
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:42,870
Speaker 0: We haven't been doing him that often because rim doesn't know how to read and you kids probably didn't read this book either.

347
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,499
Speaker 1: I think a bunch of people read the book.

348
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,001
Speaker 0: I hope so.

349
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:45,665
Speaker 1: Maybe they're.

350
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,630
Speaker 1: hopefully they'll read it now.

351
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,303
Speaker 0: But can I come July 9th and all that will be there.

352
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,009
Speaker 0: it's gonna be awesome focus too soon.

353
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,826
Speaker 0: Oh my god this weekend is the nerd NYC recess in Manhattan.

354
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:56,690
Speaker 0: You should go check that out.

355
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,240
Speaker 0: We'll be there Saturday all day.

356
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,368
Speaker 1: gaming action.

357
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,900
Speaker 0: We're gonna announce the next book club book.

358
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:02,886
Speaker 0: Maybe we should do it right now.

359
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:06,790
Speaker 0: right now I'm not gonna wait maybe for the people who didn't read this book.

360
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:09,504
Speaker 0: So at least there's a chance before they turn off the episode.

361
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:10,489
Speaker 0: They know what the next book is.

362
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,433
Speaker 1: All right, we could do that.

363
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:14,405
Speaker 0: So it's your turn to pick I believe basically right.

364
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:21,930
Speaker 1: so Gabe from penny arcade He only likes books that have pictures of rocket ships or planets on the cover right or Star Wars.

365
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:27,084
Speaker 0: so Star Wars books don't have pictures of rockets or planets on the cover in all cases.

366
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:27,886
Speaker 1: No, they usually do.

367
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:36,350
Speaker 1: but anyway, he He you know, he's he's slowly been getting away You know, he's played some RPGs and D&D and that sort of thing.

368
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:40,327
Speaker 1: So he asked on Twitter a while back like what book do I read?

369
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:40,709
Speaker 1: Right?

370
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:43,885
Speaker 1: So There were all kinds of suggestions being tweeted at him.

371
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:51,105
Speaker 1: So Someone sort went and combined all of the suggestions into like a sheet and was like up.

372
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:55,317
Speaker 1: this was suggested ten times and this Five times and this right, you know the X time.

373
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:59,630
Speaker 1: so you could see all the suggestions together and which ones were the most suggested.

374
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:13,109
Speaker 1: so I look at this list and I'm looking and a lot of it is like ra Salvatore bla bla bla or song of ice and fire And I'm like Dragon land something I'm like.

375
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:21,972
Speaker 0: What's funny is if you look at the level of those books like the forgotten realms ones were some of the least shitty of those Books.

376
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:24,689
Speaker 0: you can have a dragon Lance dear God.

377
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:35,685
Speaker 1: there was some pretty bad books suggested but there was one book that was suggested that had a great many suggestions many and I had never heard of it and it was called the lies of Locke Lamora.

378
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:36,749
Speaker 1: and I was like, what is this?

379
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:47,560
Speaker 1: So I look it up and Apparently it was a fantasy novel about some sort of con artist, dude Already up my alley.

380
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,849
Speaker 1: So I'm like, huh?

381
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:57,896
Speaker 1: That seems like the kind of book that is gonna have some sort of maybe American gods ish kind of action in it maybe something.

382
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:03,445
Speaker 0: so also, you know Scott was explaining it to me and It has one of the things that I'm an absolute sucker for.

383
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,902
Speaker 0: any time There's precursor technology in anything.

384
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,430
Speaker 0: I'm all about that shit.

385
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it's a sign of a good book when you've got.

386
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,950
Speaker 1: you know, there's some sort of world with all these mysteries.

387
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:21,852
Speaker 1: But the story is just about people living in this world and isn't about the mystery of the world like cowboy bebop Exactly.

388
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:31,986
Speaker 1: If you go to Amazon a hundred and eleven five-star reviews 56 four-star reviews only 16 three stars 12 two stars and nine one star.

389
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,133
Speaker 1: see whenever I find like that It's a pretty good.

390
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:37,129
Speaker 0: I always read every single one of the one-star reviews.

391
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:38,414
Speaker 1: Yep Just to see.

392
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:46,944
Speaker 1: the other thing is that you look in the front of the book where you know There's all the quotes from reviews saying how great the book is and there's like a ton of pages.

393
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:49,210
Speaker 1: all like it's like multiple.

394
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:50,834
Speaker 0: Wait a minute Scott.

395
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:52,763
Speaker 0: The book is called the lies of locked lab.

396
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,828
Speaker 0: Are you sure they're not all just lies?

397
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,249
Speaker 1: No, there's like multiple pages of you know pull quotes from positive reviews for the book.

398
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:02,670
Speaker 1: It usually they only put a few in like the back cover in the front cover.

399
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:04,638
Speaker 1: This is like a whole section of them.

400
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,590
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm like, all right, there is something up with this book.

401
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:08,980
Speaker 0: Well, especially look at the title.

402
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,290
Speaker 0: It's got pretty good alliteration.

403
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:18,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, very good Kind I like the lot and I like how it's like the definite article like it's there like the lies of locked lamera.

404
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,421
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's been out for a while.

405
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:21,970
Speaker 1: It's by this guy named Scott Lynch.

406
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,830
Speaker 1: It's actually been out so long that as a sequel the sequel is called Red Seas Under Red Skies.

407
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:31,290
Speaker 1: I bought the sequel but I haven't read it yet And they're both mass-market paperbacks.

408
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,969
Speaker 1: They've been out for a while and they're way cheap.

409
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:39,090
Speaker 1: So I got it and I read it and it was pretty awesome and it should totally be a movie.

410
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:45,330
Speaker 0: So what I'm curious about just doesn't get some perspective better or worse than say the prince of nothing books like the first one.

411
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,662
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not it's not like Prince nothing.

412
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:51,056
Speaker 1: It's not you know, okay It doesn't really have.

413
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:56,836
Speaker 1: you know, the the the deepness and intellectualness It is you know, it is.

414
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,505
Speaker 1: it is a story and it is about what happens in.

415
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:06,099
Speaker 1: the story is very literal There isn't like a huge deep Symbology and such and such.

416
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,340
Speaker 1: fine.

417
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,024
Speaker 0: I was just curious.

418
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:08,150
Speaker 0: I'm still down for it.

419
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:16,399
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you know, dude, there's some adventures and there's some fighting and lies lots of lies And you know, the thing is is like shit happens.

420
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:19,327
Speaker 1: you I didn't see coming for shit shit.

421
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:20,290
Speaker 1: It's like whoa.

422
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,083
Speaker 1: There was like two or three times in the book where it's like.

423
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:25,450
Speaker 1: whoa did not just happen.

424
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,955
Speaker 1: Oh my god spoilers.

425
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:30,690
Speaker 0: and I was really surprised at the end when he whips out the vuvuzela and brings down.

426
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:34,609
Speaker 1: So It's a pretty quality book.

427
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:39,630
Speaker 1: It's a good choice because I already read it and that means that we'll just wait for rim to read it.

428
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll order it on Amazon tonight and then You know I can read other things in the meantime.

429
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:51,505
Speaker 0: Actually, the problem is I just started reading a book that I should have read but I've never read.

430
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:52,809
Speaker 0: thus begs our threestra.

431
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,225
Speaker 0: So I got to stop that to finish Locke Lamora and then start that back up again.

432
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:57,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't take that long.

433
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,236
Speaker 1: I mean Locke Lamora is.

434
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:03,400
Speaker 1: it's not a short book, you know, it's a pretty standard like the Prince of Nothing or like Hyperion.

435
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,902
Speaker 0: there's not.

436
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:09,744
Speaker 0: I doubt it's going to be Information and you know, it's not gonna have the density of one of those books.

437
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,350
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty much this happens.

438
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,092
Speaker 1: This happens.

439
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,176
Speaker 1: someone so says this.

440
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,139
Speaker 1: Hey, what's going on?

441
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:14,961
Speaker 1: It's just happens.

442
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:16,687
Speaker 0: It's lyrical and eloquent at least right?

443
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:17,770
Speaker 0: Not like lensman.

444
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:22,824
Speaker 0: Look, I mean The language was very direct and very like.

445
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:23,830
Speaker 0: this is what is happening.

446
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:26,869
Speaker 0: Is it like that or is it more like the Llewellyn kind of?

447
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty normal.

448
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:29,794
Speaker 0: is there?

449
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,160
Speaker 0: no no prose like to the style stand out at all?

450
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just curious.

451
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:35,720
Speaker 0: I haven't read anything about it yet.

452
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,547
Speaker 0: Except the spoiler side about it's not.

453
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:41,107
Speaker 1: it's not exactly You know all poetic like Tokin or anything.

454
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,008
Speaker 0: Okay I'm just curious.

455
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:44,916
Speaker 1: All right, so that's that.

456
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:45,620
Speaker 0: All right.

457
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,549
Speaker 0: I think that's it for the meta stuff.

458
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:51,469
Speaker 0: If you if you're in the city come to the recess this weekend, we'll see ya.

459
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:55,888
Speaker 0: We'll probably all go out to a nice dinner somewhere cuz it's not like these events are super crowded.

460
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,881
Speaker 0: Nope We don't have to hide from anyone like we do some anime cons either.

461
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:04,710
Speaker 0: Hmm unless it's overcrowded Yep, and we might have a whole bunch of stuff coming up in the city in the near future.

462
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:07,444
Speaker 0: But we'll talk about that in a future metamoment.

463
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,193
Speaker 0: Yeah It'll be fun.

464
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:10,795
Speaker 1: Whatever.

465
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:22,158
Speaker 0: so the previous book that we finished the book that I picked Carl Sagan's cosmos We have both read it completely me for the second time Scott for the first time though I'll admit the first time I read it as a kid.

466
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:25,309
Speaker 0: I skipped a whole bunch in the middle that reading.

467
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,479
Speaker 0: now I wish I hadn't skipped.

468
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,469
Speaker 1: that did not really count.

469
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:29,277
Speaker 0: It wouldn't account in any way.

470
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:30,824
Speaker 0: I didn't remember half of this stuff.

471
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:35,522
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Anyway, the so cosmos.

472
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:42,250
Speaker 1: I think the first thing about cosmos Right is that this is like the best deal in terms of value for dollar.

473
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,790
Speaker 0: Oh my god this book for like four dollars.

474
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:53,239
Speaker 1: No, no, but I mean in terms of what you get right because you get a science book And History book and you know, it's like.

475
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,250
Speaker 1: it's like multiple books all in one book.

476
00:28:56,991 --> 00:29:00,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like, you know, you bought a book and it's just one thing.

477
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:02,150
Speaker 1: It's like three books at a time.

478
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,222
Speaker 0: Well, what really struck me about it now?

479
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:05,208
Speaker 0: I didn't think of it as a kid.

480
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:06,436
Speaker 0: I read it I was like, that's awesome.

481
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:21,510
Speaker 0: But reading it now it's amazing how well it tells you the story of the cosmos or the story of the universe to the point that it Feels almost like you're reading a novel like you're never bored or they're like always explaining some shit about neutrons.

482
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,444
Speaker 0: You're like then what did the Neutron do?

483
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,170
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

484
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:41,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually like you read a nonfiction book of any kind, you know, and it's just like You can fall asleep pretty easily in the vast majority of them because you know They're stating a bunch of facts or it's a bunch of essays making arguments or even like Stephen Hawking books are pretty readable But it'll be like such and such and such.

485
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:42,330
Speaker 1: Here's a fun example.

486
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:44,350
Speaker 1: Such as such is a fun example.

487
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:50,186
Speaker 0: They're like Michio Kaku where it makes sense for a while But then the analogies get so complex that he starts analogizing the analogies.

488
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:54,544
Speaker 1: You just fucking lose me Yeah, but this book is like so readable.

489
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,090
Speaker 1: You can just keep going no problem.

490
00:29:56,271 --> 00:30:02,990
Speaker 0: And the thing is I think anyone with you know, at least anyone without mental difficulties could understand everything in this book.

491
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:14,750
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, like in the way it's presented I think there was one part of the book that had maths that some people might not be able to understand Where he's like, you know all the the how many the odds of alien civilizations existing anywhere.

492
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:21,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also some people might not be able to understand the you know, the the math of like the orbits, right?

493
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you're right.

494
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:25,970
Speaker 0: The math could be out of reach of some people but at least the concepts.

495
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:32,970
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any concept in this book that anyone with a hundred IQ could not grasp in a meaningful at least analogous manner.

496
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:38,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know in fact, you know, like I grasp pretty much the whole book, right?

497
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:48,564
Speaker 1: But there were actually many things in the book that I just did not know or I feel like I should have known but was Quite stupid and just never because like I was never really into astronomy.

498
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:50,550
Speaker 1: I never thought about it really at all.

499
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,536
Speaker 1: You know, I knew things like.

500
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:57,210
Speaker 1: you have a telescope you pointed at the sky you look so you didn't know like pulsars versus quasars.

501
00:30:58,151 --> 00:30:59,237
Speaker 1: Well, no, I didn't know that.

502
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:05,970
Speaker 1: but like the most basic kind of thing I didn't even know but like as soon as they said it I was like, oh that's really obvious.

503
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:14,428
Speaker 1: I should have known that is that you look up at the sky and the stars never move but the planets move around all the time and they move around.

504
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:18,650
Speaker 1: like And I was like, oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense.

505
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:22,642
Speaker 1: I never thought about it because I've never even thought about astronomy or cared.

506
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:34,538
Speaker 1: really it's interesting because when I was that's how Right, the people in ancient times were able to know that these things are planets and those things weren't even though they didn't have telescopes Or shit was because they were fucking moving around.

507
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:47,240
Speaker 0: the fascinating part when he gets into like even modern astronomy like he talks about how people actually figured these things out and just the attention to detail and the tiny things like, you know, You make a thousand measurements of like.

508
00:31:47,561 --> 00:32:05,425
Speaker 0: this is where that star was on this day And this is where it was on this day and you have a thousand in a row and you think you've got it down and then one day it's slightly off from where you expect and You realize everything you thought was completely wrong and you have to kind of figure out the new thing and that people did that and we humans

509
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:05,788
Speaker 1: knew a

510
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,689
Speaker 0: Substantial amount of what we know today a long time ago.

511
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,042
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it also right is imagine you had no TV.

512
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:14,146
Speaker 1: You had no books.

513
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:18,050
Speaker 1: You had no arts You had no nothing right and there's no lights either.

514
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,349
Speaker 1: So you look up at the sky every single night and you see all that shit all of it, right?

515
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,158
Speaker 1: No, you sit there for like hours.

516
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:27,305
Speaker 1: Just looking at it every goddamn day.

517
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:28,610
Speaker 1: You know what you're gonna notice.

518
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,576
Speaker 1: You're gonna remember what it looks like.

519
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:39,070
Speaker 1: you're gonna memorize the locations of different bits and you're gonna see if like the red dot moves around None of these dots move except that red one.

520
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:53,630
Speaker 0: Imagine - in a demon haunted world like in in an era when you we don't know what's out there You might mean there are people they would think, you know They're looking up at the gods or the faces of the gods or some like they had no idea what the stars were.

521
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,654
Speaker 0: but You know.

522
00:32:55,855 --> 00:33:01,259
Speaker 0: imagine just the feeling of power of studying something like that back then when for all you know Those are gods you're studying.

523
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:02,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, like legit.

524
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:17,209
Speaker 0: But it's interesting to me that especially the astronomy stuff that a lot of this I knew from a kid because I was really really Really into astronomy and I had all these books and I read them all the time and I'd read this But I'd forgotten most of this because it doesn't come up in my daily life.

525
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:27,309
Speaker 0: yeah, like I just I'd never thought once about pulsars and quasars and the structure of the galaxies and all that until I Read this book again, and I remembered how absolutely fascinating it all is.

526
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:43,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, I think the whole thing is like this great, you know, because people today right you try to like convince Someone of something that's all sciency like hey, you know micro-evolution or hey, you know freakin Quarks or something and they'd be like.

527
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:59,217
Speaker 1: I don't see that it ain't real what you show me a picture You know show me some fossils or whatever you got right and the thing is well This dude a bajillion years ago all he saw was a bunch of dots moving around and he figured out that the earth was round and he figured out all the Orbits of all the planets.

528
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:03,538
Speaker 1: and then when we made a rocket We saw and it was right.

529
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,166
Speaker 1: So it's the same thing.

530
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:25,630
Speaker 1: We can definitely absolutely using science figure out crazy shit and You know based on just like these like crazy Observations of the barest barest details and then later when the science improves We'll look and we'll probably be right just like we were right about all those things.

531
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,466
Speaker 0: I mean, isn't it just awe-inspiring that we've mapped places that probably nothing we ever do will ever affect.

532
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:32,489
Speaker 0: They're so far away?

533
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they're also probably no longer existing seeing as there's new things there.

534
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:44,570
Speaker 1: Was there anything in the book that like, you know, I mean the book is such, you know old and proven science, right?

535
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:51,746
Speaker 1: But so usually when you start reading about physics like you, you know My at least my brain does it likes to like come up with new physics like oh, what if this?

536
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:57,830
Speaker 1: yeah What if that right and it's obviously all usually wrong or figured out by some physicists already?

537
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,610
Speaker 1: So I try not to do that because I know that it's that it's wrong.

538
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:07,687
Speaker 1: But did you come up with like any like, you know things like oh, man I think this I might have had a a discovery of physics.

539
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:11,989
Speaker 0: Oh shit I did that a lot when I was a kid with black holes and stuff like that.

540
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:36,410
Speaker 0: And now the only thing that I thought of when I was reading this that I think was novel in my brain But then Carl Sagan said it straight up later was you know He's talking about the structure of the universe and how you know the center of the universe could be a point outside of anything we can experience like if it like if there's a four-dimensional universe and The Big Bang, you know the center of the universe could exist in a space that is not accessible to us and our three dimensions.

541
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,246
Speaker 0: You know things like that.

542
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:51,784
Speaker 0: And he points out that if the universe is infinite and boundless or sorry non infinite But boundless because it wraps around on itself and all that that light cannot escape it and that effectively the universe is from the outside a black hole.

543
00:35:51,804 --> 00:36:00,052
Speaker 0: Yep, and That threw me for a huge loop this time funnily enough because I was thinking about the Prince of Nothing Mm-hmm.

544
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:10,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, because remember the whole idea of causality and the idea of free will and Morality and everything at least in those books and in a lot of philosophy comes out of the idea that if one thing begets.

545
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,525
Speaker 0: Another thing there's an uninterrupted chain of causality from the Big Bang to the destruction of the universe if there is one.

546
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:22,112
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm unless chains of causality from without are able to come within Mm-hmm.

547
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:29,109
Speaker 0: So imagine if the universe is just a big black hole or some equivalent of it or there is an outside that isn't.

548
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:30,749
Speaker 0: that is a separate causal chain.

549
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:38,147
Speaker 0: We've spawned everything we ever did from the Big Bang and that is the entirety of our experience that we could ever have our entire causal chain.

550
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:42,101
Speaker 0: But things enter black holes from the outside and cannot escape.

551
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:46,715
Speaker 0: so it's possible that things could enter our universe Sorry from the outside.

552
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:47,558
Speaker 0: It's got in the face.

553
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:48,742
Speaker 1: It's not doing it.

554
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:49,705
Speaker 0: who's the lifestyle.

555
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:51,352
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

556
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:56,147
Speaker 0: I was thinking about that the idea that you know What could our universe be like from the outside even though?

557
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,709
Speaker 0: Carl and every other scientist say that's not even a question we can ask because it has no relevance.

558
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:07,161
Speaker 1: one thing I was thinking about right is like, okay Everything is red shifted Doppler effect.

559
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:07,682
Speaker 1: Therefore.

560
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:09,730
Speaker 1: We know the universe is expanding, right?

561
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:12,230
Speaker 1: Anything you look at is red shifted.

562
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,944
Speaker 0: Well, either things are moving away from us because universe expanding or you know space itself is expanding.

563
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:18,870
Speaker 1: same thing base effectively, right?

564
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,738
Speaker 1: So here's the thing that I was wondering though.

565
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:22,586
Speaker 1: Nothing goes fast in the speed of light, right?

566
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

567
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,700
Speaker 1: So everything started in the Big Bang area and then spread out.

568
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:30,170
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's say you and I are standing next to each other.

569
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,960
Speaker 1: Right, I can see you and you can see me.

570
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:35,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember there's already a speed of light to lay between us.

571
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,619
Speaker 1: I know that you're a billion years.

572
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,950
Speaker 1: Let's say you're a billion light years away, right?

573
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,730
Speaker 1: Well, I see you but I see you a billion years ago because you were standing there a billion years ago, right?

574
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:51,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's say you start right next to me because everything started right next to each other at the Big Bang, right?

575
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:55,350
Speaker 1: And then you start running away from me and this goes on forever, right?

576
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,977
Speaker 1: You can't go the speed of light.

577
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,290
Speaker 1: You can only go almost the speed of light, right?

578
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,937
Speaker 1: So let's say you go.

579
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:02,706
Speaker 1: I don't know 90% the speed of light.

580
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:03,350
Speaker 1: you're running away.

581
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:12,109
Speaker 1: Well, as long as I stand there and keep looking at you the light that hits you will pretend that light is always hitting you And bouncing off you and coming back to me.

582
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's light always right infinite light.

583
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:20,930
Speaker 1: So Basically if I stand there no matter how much you keep running.

584
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,178
Speaker 1: I will always see you right no matter what.

585
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:23,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

586
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,119
Speaker 1: Well, I might see you as you were X years ago But I'll still continue to see.

587
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,130
Speaker 1: you will never disappear at any point.

588
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:37,239
Speaker 1: if you there's always light shining on you and you're not a black hole and I keep looking at you and such right nothing.

589
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:37,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, therefore would it not follow that?

591
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,120
Speaker 1: Everything that exists in our universe is visible and there is no.

592
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,790
Speaker 1: there's nothing hiding like beyond out somewhere else that we can't see.

593
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:52,920
Speaker 1: Because if something started next to us then we can still.

594
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:56,449
Speaker 1: either it's a black hole and it's absorbing light or something there could be.

595
00:38:57,354 --> 00:39:00,030
Speaker 0: Here's one way one of the multitude of ways that can be broken.

596
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:09,690
Speaker 0: okay, there's an object that was shot out at 99% of the speed of light that was not emitting any light and Then due to its own internal reactions while it's moving it starts emitting light.

597
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,537
Speaker 0: What when it's already a billion light years away?

598
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,895
Speaker 0: that light won't reach us for a billion years plus the time that's added from the expansion of the universe in between us and it.

599
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:28,261
Speaker 1: that is very possible, but that my point is, you know that there be the We look out in the universe and pretty much.

600
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,087
Speaker 1: most things are emitting light, right?

601
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:33,220
Speaker 1: I mean, we don't know Radiation black hole.

602
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're emitting something right?

603
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:37,137
Speaker 1: X-rays radio waves, right?

604
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,862
Speaker 1: This is you know talking about astronomy, right?

605
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:40,989
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of emitting going on.

606
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,950
Speaker 1: So I don't think you know, at least I'm not a physicist.

607
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,872
Speaker 1: I'm probably very wrong as you know But I'm not.

608
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:56,030
Speaker 1: I'm pretty convinced that there isn't that much stuff that is out there if we all started in the same spot.

609
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:57,797
Speaker 0: Well, it's got two things that we can't see.

610
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:00,650
Speaker 0: one is not a perfect universe and shit gets in the way of light.

611
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,597
Speaker 0: We're a tiny speck.

612
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:05,598
Speaker 1: shit does get in the way of light But it's like, you know the farthest away there.

613
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:09,594
Speaker 1: I don't think there's like some barrier like oh, it's a if it's you know The universe.

614
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:11,709
Speaker 1: let's say the universe is a billion years old, right?

615
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,479
Speaker 1: Then there it can't really be anything.

616
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,185
Speaker 1: that's two billion light-years away.

617
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:17,867
Speaker 1: can there be?

618
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:19,494
Speaker 0: well the Sagan.

619
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:22,810
Speaker 0: I think he pointed out straight up that I mean the universe is many more billions like.

620
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:31,116
Speaker 0: They saw two galaxies and for a while there was speculation that we were actually just seeing the Milky Way From the other direction.

621
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:31,879
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

622
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,184
Speaker 0: This isn't like the 20s.

623
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:43,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then later Science taught us that no the universe is already clearly big enough to where light could not traverse the length of the universe In the time that the universe has existed.

624
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,975
Speaker 0: hmm Now that could be screwed up.

625
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:50,610
Speaker 0: by the way the universe expands because it's space itself that may be expanding.

626
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,225
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I can barely wrap my head around as it is.

627
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:54,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

628
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:55,450
Speaker 1: Well, what about this, right?

629
00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:05,203
Speaker 1: What if we both started in the in the Big Bang area, right and you I went do north I guess whatever north is and you went do south and we were both going in 99% the speed of light.

630
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

631
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:09,848
Speaker 0: So It's possible that we would eventually run into each other?

632
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:19,070
Speaker 0: Well, no, but I'm not saying we're running into each other I'm saying would you still wouldn't disappear at any point right now because we'd both as if I'm moving away because you at the speed Of light and you're moving away from me at the speed of light.

633
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:25,512
Speaker 0: I think the mean difference in speed between the two of us would still be the speed of light because it's all relative to the Speed of light.

634
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think think about like two race cars, right?

635
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:36,918
Speaker 1: So you got two race cars and one guy's driving one way and one guy's driving the other way on an infinite track Right and they both got.

636
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,688
Speaker 1: look in the rearview mirror and they're looking at the other guy, right?

637
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:46,709
Speaker 1: Even if both guys are going real close to the speed of light, right the light will still right.

638
00:41:47,393 --> 00:41:49,550
Speaker 1: You know light you think about it.

639
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,069
Speaker 1: Each guy is basically being chased by another car.

640
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:55,490
Speaker 1: That is the light car and the light car is going at the speed of light.

641
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:59,550
Speaker 1: So the light car will always catch you because you're going less than it, right?

642
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,710
Speaker 1: Even if you got a huge head start if I'm going one mile an hour There's still the catch you eventually.

643
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:09,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's still the propagation delay of the light has to bounce off and come back.

644
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,310
Speaker 0: So it takes twice as much time plus the fact that you're constantly becoming further away.

645
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was you know, as long as the.

646
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:20,392
Speaker 1: but if this like an infinite stream of light cars one is catching you at Every moment.

647
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:22,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, so you're for the car.

648
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:26,569
Speaker 0: the other car will never disappear further away when everyone hits you.

649
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:30,424
Speaker 0: Yes Of course the delay between each one coming back is the time.

650
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,702
Speaker 1: the time is absolutely relative But the other car won't disappear.

651
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:39,290
Speaker 1: It will always be there No, but the speed and thus two stars going in the opposite direction from the Big Bang.

652
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:42,050
Speaker 1: They will always be able to see the other star.

653
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:49,265
Speaker 1: They'll still see the star as it was a bajillion years ago But they'll still see it unless space is expanding at a rate that messes that up.

654
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,470
Speaker 1: That's so we don't know.

655
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:51,192
Speaker 1: I don't know.

656
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:53,381
Speaker 1: someone knows maybe not me.

657
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:54,405
Speaker 1: Probably not me.

658
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:55,509
Speaker 1: Definitely not me.

659
00:42:56,071 --> 00:43:05,766
Speaker 0: What I noticed though that one thing about cosmos and this format works really well for this sort of book is notice how he'll Start with something where he's vague and he says hey, so here's a fact.

660
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:06,750
Speaker 0: Here's another fact.

661
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:15,550
Speaker 0: Here's another fact and they lead you in a direction of where you're like Wait a minute if those things are all true, and then he asks you so what if blah?

662
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,775
Speaker 0: What if blah?

663
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:20,106
Speaker 0: and he gets you trying to come up with the answer.

664
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:23,249
Speaker 0: then he's like well The answer is actually blah and you're like, huh?

665
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,927
Speaker 0: and then he talks about how they figured out the answer was blah and how awesome that story was.

666
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:32,001
Speaker 0: and then he's like So if blah is true, then what about blah?

667
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:37,789
Speaker 0: and he always ends everything with speculation and a question Mm-hmm, like everything he always gives you all these facts then he's like.

668
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:45,039
Speaker 0: but the odds are this or but what if this or what if that and what if this and the what ifs always get in The end toward the point of and there is.

669
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,024
Speaker 0: I don't have the answer for you.

670
00:43:46,105 --> 00:43:46,426
Speaker 0: We don't know.

671
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:47,150
Speaker 0: we have to figure this out.

672
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,341
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think it's very telling that the book is based on the TV show.

673
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:57,470
Speaker 1: right because you know in the introduction He actually says that they're sort of separate and complimentary or whatever and they're you know, whatever.

674
00:43:57,611 --> 00:44:06,382
Speaker 1: But the thing is each chapter is totally its own standalone thing You know, but you can tell that because he knows that this is the book.

675
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:15,290
Speaker 1: some of the chapters will be like yeah Kepler Sutton Sutton because he knows that you will probably read the chap the Kepler chapter earlier on, you know.

676
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:19,124
Speaker 1: Whereas in the TV show, there's no guarantee that you saw the previous episode.

677
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:20,750
Speaker 1: So it was structured a little different there.

678
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:28,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but it's it's pretty cool that it's like each and every chapter is its own Deal as if it were an episode.

679
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:37,534
Speaker 0: the show itself is really good Like each one is self-contained and follows that format and it starts out by showing you cool stuff and explains it all then asks you More questions than ends.

680
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:38,056
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

681
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:39,361
Speaker 0: Good music and stuff too.

682
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:41,850
Speaker 0: And I just like watching Carl Sagan listening to his voice.

683
00:44:42,232 --> 00:44:43,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's a cool dude.

684
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:45,106
Speaker 1: I was a cool dude.

685
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:48,649
Speaker 1: Yeah What else do you guys say about this book?

686
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,890
Speaker 1: I think you know the history parts of the book really helped me out because you know, I'm not too good at the chronologies.

687
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,929
Speaker 0: Captain who who I came first Knights or Romans?

688
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, it was.

689
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:06,089
Speaker 1: it was cool to actually because there's a bunch of science names, you know.

690
00:45:07,693 --> 00:45:09,470
Speaker 1: And you know, I don't Kepler van Leeuwenhoek.

691
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like you already.

692
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:12,837
Speaker 0: did you already forget him?

693
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,362
Speaker 0: What Kepler do?

694
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:17,954
Speaker 0: I don't remember what van Leeuwenhoek do I don't remember.

695
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:20,310
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, but you know, it's.

696
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:28,095
Speaker 1: It's cool that you know because that's not stuff that you're taught very much in school really, you know I wasn't straight up.

697
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:31,786
Speaker 0: In fact, all the physicists like the whole thing about wave particle duality with light.

698
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:35,829
Speaker 0: we in physics We actually did a history lesson on every single one of those people.

699
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:49,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, our science classes didn't really teach us so much about the people's, you know, they might have mentioned someone's name once You know or they'd like I learn more about like Copernicus and social studies class than science class and reading cosmos.

700
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:54,310
Speaker 1: What they told you about Copernicus is pretty wrong or at least lacking many important details.

701
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,683
Speaker 0: So there's actually a book that Emily's dad lent her that I borrowed and read.

702
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:02,550
Speaker 0: and if you like the history part of this Like what the scientists did now?

703
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,630
Speaker 0: They figured it out and what was going on at the time Bill Bryson wrote a book called a short history of nearly everything.

704
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:09,794
Speaker 0: And it's just that.

705
00:46:09,874 --> 00:46:15,010
Speaker 0: it's like here's this scientist and here's what his deal was and some of these people were fucked up.

706
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,350
Speaker 1: So it tells you all about like the people themselves.

707
00:46:20,772 --> 00:46:30,304
Speaker 0: Just you know in the science interspersed much like how Carl Sagan does it in cosmos like with Tycho Brahe You know, he's crazy but also like what was going on between him and everybody else.

708
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:37,670
Speaker 0: and you know, and It like my favorite part of it is there's one guy who he had two great ideas.

709
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:40,794
Speaker 0: There were actually terrible ideas But he had no way to know at the time.

710
00:46:41,155 --> 00:46:47,279
Speaker 0: the same dude who invented CFCs that destroy the ozone layer was also like lead in Gasoline that solves everything.

711
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:49,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, he just didn't.

712
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,517
Speaker 1: It's not that he was evil.

713
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,322
Speaker 1: He just didn't know.

714
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,188
Speaker 0: Well, he tested.

715
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:55,504
Speaker 0: he was like I gave these people all this lead and they peed most of it out.

716
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,288
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll hurt him.

717
00:46:56,308 --> 00:47:01,621
Speaker 1: Let's go And that's true and it won't hurt you won't.

718
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:03,650
Speaker 1: you won't notice anything immediately, you know.

719
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,810
Speaker 1: And they you know, there's a lot of things where it's like people would have been cool.

720
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:09,216
Speaker 1: They just didn't know better.

721
00:47:09,236 --> 00:47:12,490
Speaker 0: and it takes actually that I bring that up because I read an interesting article.

722
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:17,192
Speaker 0: This is speculation on behalf of a bunch of sign and you wonder like, you know Who now?

723
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:22,590
Speaker 1: will someone in the future look at and say we just didn't know better and you know currently what are we getting wrong?

724
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,913
Speaker 1: We just don't know yet.

725
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:25,839
Speaker 0: It'll be like giant robo.

726
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly exactly like giant robo pretty much.

727
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:33,975
Speaker 0: So, I mean, I don't know.

728
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:45,368
Speaker 0: I feel like cosmos should be a textbook for like middle school kids and pretty much every science class ever like like every seventh grader should read cosmos or at least like big chunks of it as part of their schooling.

729
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:46,191
Speaker 0: because I think it Really?

730
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:54,446
Speaker 0: It inspires people like it's written in the same way that a religious text might be written But it's just facts and speculation based on facts.

731
00:47:54,868 --> 00:48:10,530
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the other thing is you know, it's it's obviously like, you know, a lot of times the you know, These skeptical kinds of sciency people, you know They they're not very good at using the psychology and the coercion and all that, right?

732
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:20,086
Speaker 1: But he manages to write this in such a way that is not like offensive or off-putting and say a Richard Dawkins kind of way talking is like there's no God.

733
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:20,790
Speaker 0: What are you stupid?

734
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same second is like isn't this awesome?

735
00:48:24,411 --> 00:48:30,790
Speaker 1: But at the same time right, he's not really doing it in sort of a morally evil trickery way.

736
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:33,518
Speaker 1: He's not tricking you or like suckering you in.

737
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:40,939
Speaker 0: he basically like he'll explain like here is the beauty of this like this Facet of the universe of the cosmos, isn't that fucking awesome?

738
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,673
Speaker 0: now, maybe just some guy made it up or maybe this Look at this.

739
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:50,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, or he's like, oh, you know aliens are cool.

740
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:54,643
Speaker 1: man wouldn't be awesome if they're aliens Let's figure out what the odds are.

741
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:55,830
Speaker 1: They're being aliens.

742
00:48:56,191 --> 00:49:05,673
Speaker 1: What would aliens be like, you know, and then indeed approaches it, you know, realistically and then it's just like, uh-huh And now you know, it's like.

743
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:22,362
Speaker 1: well, okay now we've discussed aliens and that's pretty awesome and we've also Realized that people who think that their cows were slaughtered by you know, moon men are crazy But we don't need to even mention that because we have just discussed You know the real part and we did not include anything about.

744
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,510
Speaker 1: you know, moon men because there aren't any movement.

745
00:49:25,137 --> 00:49:26,190
Speaker 0: I guess we can wrap it up here.

746
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:32,410
Speaker 0: I mean, there's not much to say but praise for this book and I hope you read it and luckily there's nothing to spoil.

747
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,312
Speaker 0: Spoilers Spoilers.

748
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:39,107
Speaker 1: the Big Bang is for real spoilers evolution.

749
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:39,550
Speaker 1: It works.

750
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:45,870
Speaker 0: It's real say is I cannot imagine the person who would read this book and still deny the fact that the Big Bang happened.

751
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:47,322
Speaker 0: We don't know what or why.

752
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:48,290
Speaker 0: there's a lot we don't know about it.

753
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:53,007
Speaker 0: But to deny that an event like that happened is just ludicrous

754
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:58,187
Speaker 1: like yeah I mean you'd have to like either not be able to understand you not understand the book

755
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:04,789
Speaker 0: or Anyone with an IQ of a hundred probably even like 70 could understand the majority of what is in this book.

756
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:06,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

757
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:09,650
Speaker 1: or you know, you're just denying, you know, you have denial.

758
00:50:12,754 --> 00:50:25,406
Speaker 1: You know, there are many, you know all sorts of reasons but You know or like a selective You know selectively choosing which parts to read and understand and which parts not to read and understand.

759
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,504
Speaker 0: there dot-dot-dot is Dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot.

760
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:37,285
Speaker 1: God You know stuff like that, you know never underestimate the the ignorance of people.

761
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:39,390
Speaker 1: that is not something to be underestimated.

762
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:48,402
Speaker 1: I actually really like the last line of cosmos - Mmm, the other thing is that it's funny how the you know the book.

763
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:51,111
Speaker 1: most of the stuff in the book Right is.

764
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:57,310
Speaker 1: this is like old ultra proven science that you know, it was you know Determined over hundreds of years.

765
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:00,018
Speaker 0: I was watching through with Emily because she'd never seen it.

766
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:09,330
Speaker 0: some of like select episodes from the series, right and they had this introduction from a woman and then they had Carl Sagan come in and talk a few times where he was like.

767
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:14,589
Speaker 0: So here's like some updates on this like yeah this spacecraft did this and we learned this.

768
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:22,630
Speaker 0: But from everything I can read there is almost nothing that is wrong in cosmos or that we have figured out later was wrong.

769
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,829
Speaker 0: Speculation was later proven to be correct.

770
00:51:26,102 --> 00:51:35,678
Speaker 1: Yeah it's the kind of stuff right in cut that's in cosmos is science that's so old and so rock-solid that if we're to if it Were to be unsolid did it would?

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,465
Speaker 1: it wouldn't be unsolid.

772
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:54,199
Speaker 1: it like oh my god suddenly it would take a long time for us to find something that is, you know contradictory to what is already in there and Also, you know the a lot of this stuff was just you know Was true in its day and it just needed updates right?

773
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,410
Speaker 1: For example, he's like, huh, you know, we we did this to Mars.

774
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:03,265
Speaker 1: What if we sent like a robot with wheels that could move around and shit?

775
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:04,870
Speaker 1: and it's like well, yeah, we did that.

776
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:07,178
Speaker 1: It's like 30 40 years.

777
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:14,509
Speaker 0: It was really cool to see some of the updates where it was Carl Sagan himself You know 10 20 years later saying things like yeah, check out what we learned since then.

778
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:17,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know we it's pretty much.

779
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:22,044
Speaker 1: You know, we thought about doing this and then since then we did it and it was just like.

780
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:23,889
Speaker 1: I wrote mostly and there you go.

781
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:25,774
Speaker 0: So I think that's it.

782
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,179
Speaker 0: I hope you enjoyed cosmos.

783
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,290
Speaker 0: I hope you and I will enjoy the lives of Locke Lamora.

784
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,536
Speaker 1: I already read it.

785
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:35,084
Speaker 0: It was very good and I leave you with this.

786
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:44,210
