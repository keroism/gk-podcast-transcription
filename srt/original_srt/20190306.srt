1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,650
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, March 6th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,512
Speaker 0: I'm rim Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,860
Speaker 0: We're reviewing the anime tatami galaxy.

4
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,044
Speaker 1: Let's do this All right.

5
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:31,991
Speaker 1: So today I'm sitting at my desk like you do and usually, you know, I have headphone problems But that's usually with earbuds because the wire gets all messed up.

6
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:41,227
Speaker 0: when you got in your pocket on the subway and walk I actually just left a good pair of headphones that are noise isolating On my desk in Japan.

7
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:41,890
Speaker 0: It's the same ones.

8
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,533
Speaker 0: I got hanging here.

9
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:44,200
Speaker 0: So I got two pair of these fancy headphones.

10
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:52,000
Speaker 1: So yeah at work I got some over-ear ones with a replaceable cable and no an active noise cancelling with a triple-a battery.

11
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,550
Speaker 1: So those should not have any problem.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,037
Speaker 1: the wire breaks I can replace it.

13
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:59,730
Speaker 1: if the battery dies I recharge it, you know, it's all good right there over the ear.

14
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,999
Speaker 1: They shouldn't be fragile and break, you know little You know, there's no fragile bits, right?

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,339
Speaker 1: But today I'm sitting there on my desk and like the right ear cuts out and I'm like what the fuck?

16
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:14,945
Speaker 1: So then I like, you know check it and it's fixed and then it cuts out Huh?

17
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,840
Speaker 1: That is so I was sitting there.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,380
Speaker 1: So first of all, I'm like what is going on with this Caesar analog, right?

19
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:24,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:25,695
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the noise cancelling it.

21
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:26,540
Speaker 1: I guess yeah, they're analog.

22
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:29,338
Speaker 1: It doesn't have its own sound card in it, right?

23
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:37,600
Speaker 1: But anyway, so total the wire I plug it, you know, I'm like wait a minute and I realized what was happening was so strange.

24
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,766
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with my headphones.

25
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,371
Speaker 1: So problem number one.

26
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,277
Speaker 1: I was chewing some gum while listening.

27
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:49,167
Speaker 1: Oh Only on the right side Right.

28
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:52,869
Speaker 0: I've had something similar happen I think to what you're about to sound like.

29
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,075
Speaker 1: am I messing up my ear?

30
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:55,663
Speaker 0: cuz my Animotics?

31
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,040
Speaker 0: not not the earbud the earbuds but the actual ear plugs.

32
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:11,130
Speaker 0: If I put it in my right ear in my left ear a particular way My right ear will do something weird where if it's pushed in slightly too far it like closes My ear entirely and I hear nothing like that.

33
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:11,812
Speaker 0: ears just dead.

34
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,860
Speaker 1: Well, this is nice is over ear not in ear.

35
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,447
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, okay the plot thickens.

36
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,480
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm like, there's nothing wrong with my right ear.

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,920
Speaker 1: So I take them off and I'm listening to stuff doing the Archer thing mop, right?

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,919
Speaker 1: It's like you're making noise like I guess my right ear works or I can hear you.

39
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,766
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure my right ear is working.

40
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:27,710
Speaker 1: I'm not I'm not going.

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,400
Speaker 0: I remember I had faster than expected when I was young.

42
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,913
Speaker 0: I had a small Explosive go off kind of close to me and I remember like sitting there for a while.

43
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:35,576
Speaker 0: Like is this here?

44
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:36,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, right ear works.

45
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:37,318
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm good.

46
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:39,087
Speaker 1: What was happening?

47
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,132
Speaker 1: I finally solved it.

48
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,458
Speaker 1: Is that problem?

49
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:41,759
Speaker 1: one?

50
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,346
Speaker 1: Chewing gum.

51
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,889
Speaker 1: All right problem two I'm bald.

52
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:53,155
Speaker 1: So the the pad Right around my ear like as I was chewing.

53
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:59,260
Speaker 1: somehow air was Evacuating either into my ear hole or out and then it was creating like a suction.

54
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:01,427
Speaker 1: So there was no air in.

55
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,580
Speaker 1: it was sealed around my ear and there was no air in there anymore.

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,768
Speaker 1: So the speaker was vibrating.

57
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,840
Speaker 1: nothing or almost not enough air molecules.

58
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:16,989
Speaker 1: So even though the speaker is still vibrating in the headphone It wasn't shaking anything.

59
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,539
Speaker 1: so it couldn't shake anything inside my ear.

60
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:21,205
Speaker 0: That's plausible.

61
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,249
Speaker 1: so I couldn't hear nothing.

62
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:28,914
Speaker 1: cuz basically I tested this improved it because every time it happened I just broke the seal and it suddenly it started working again.

63
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,465
Speaker 0: That's uh That's like reverse farting.

64
00:03:32,485 --> 00:03:32,927
Speaker 0: that's right.

65
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:36,140
Speaker 1: if I had air if I had hair wouldn't have a problem.

66
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,880
Speaker 1: If I wasn't chewing gum wouldn't have a problem because it wouldn't be like squeezing the air out.

67
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,229
Speaker 0: Well depends on what hair.

68
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:50,038
Speaker 1: because you're talking about hair in the air Any hair that would break the seal of the pad on an over the ear completely surrounding the ear headphones.

69
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:51,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, right I have no hairs.

70
00:03:51,865 --> 00:04:01,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, and and I guess if I wash the side of my head Even though I just like a shower last night if I just wash the side of my head I guess maybe in the grease wouldn't.

71
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:23,991
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna to go into details on the thing I'm about to reference but you may remember a thing We read or that based from poop report at RIT about the dangers of shaving certain areas and the suction and resulting suction related issues that can occur Shaving your butt hair that story when he broke the seal.

72
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:24,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

73
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,640
Speaker 0: Yeah that one feel like it's an adjacent problem.

74
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:30,986
Speaker 0: So, what are you gonna do anything about?

75
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:32,392
Speaker 0: cuz my over-the-air headphones?

76
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:33,275
Speaker 1: No, it's not gonna chew gum.

77
00:04:36,742 --> 00:04:38,389
Speaker 0: My over-the-air headphones are really good.

78
00:04:38,489 --> 00:04:40,940
Speaker 0: They don't form a complete suction.

79
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,430
Speaker 1: You have hair right above your ear true.

80
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:43,932
Speaker 0: I do have.

81
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:45,740
Speaker 0: I have sideburns and such.

82
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,299
Speaker 1: how would how would the headphone form a perfect seal against your?

83
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:56,710
Speaker 0: The side of your head thing is my headphone even though I put it up against a completely flat surface Does not form a suction.

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,650
Speaker 0: I can't just like push it in and stick it to the wall Like it'll deflate it'll let air in.

85
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,639
Speaker 0: it's not perfect like grease it up a little bit.

86
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,880
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know if I want to grease up my fancy headphones.

87
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,867
Speaker 0: Don't feel like it could happen with these headphones.

88
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:11,212
Speaker 1: You have it with the ones I had.

89
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:15,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know your pet That's are they like a plunger like?

90
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,040
Speaker 0: could you hurt your ear by like compressing them on your head?

91
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,238
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it's like a perfect vacuum cuz like there was.

92
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:23,425
Speaker 1: you know It was just.

93
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,100
Speaker 1: I would just break the seal and then it would suddenly work again.

94
00:05:26,642 --> 00:05:26,923
Speaker 1: It might.

95
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:30,400
Speaker 1: also I don't know if there's any interaction with the active noise cancelling either.

96
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:38,880
Speaker 0: Maybe that was involved in some way because active noise cancelling could get it if it got into a state where the signal it's using.

97
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:46,600
Speaker 0: To decide to basically make the noise cancelling signal ended up being the input that's coming into the headphone in the first place.

98
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:48,059
Speaker 0: It would cancel itself out.

99
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:53,795
Speaker 0: Yeah That can happen in like regular old podcast audio engineering say.

100
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:59,154
Speaker 0: I record myself on two microphones And for whatever reason the phase of those is 180 degrees.

101
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,820
Speaker 0: They'll just cancel out to nothing.

102
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:19,588
Speaker 0: Yep This will commonly happen to people use an OBS to stream who don't know what they're doing and they'll some Stereo inputs to mono and they'll literally end up cancelling out their sound and then they'll see a really tiny volume there and they'll drag the gain up and The road you're on if you're dragging the gate up in that situation.

103
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:24,260
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it goes somewhere filled with screeching agonizing sounds.

104
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:26,450
Speaker 0: It goes somewhere.

105
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,299
Speaker 0: it goes to jikoku.

106
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,624
Speaker 0: So you got any anime news?

107
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:32,252
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got some little anime news.

108
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:41,170
Speaker 1: It's basically yeah, so first news is that Brian cave on this is the dude who writes saga.

109
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:41,852
Speaker 1: He wrote.

110
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:43,497
Speaker 1: why the good comics he wrote?

111
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:44,540
Speaker 1: why the last man?

112
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,046
Speaker 1: He wrote pride of Baghdad.

113
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,173
Speaker 1: He wrote the original runaways.

114
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:49,815
Speaker 1: He wrote.

115
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,580
Speaker 0: I kind of just stopped reading saga.

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,929
Speaker 0: I feel like I got a pick it back up ex machina.

117
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,595
Speaker 0: He's still going.

118
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,498
Speaker 0: Oh, it's still going.

119
00:06:56,578 --> 00:06:58,590
Speaker 0: Okay I haven't read it in a while.

120
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:02,213
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I got all the trades Shaky, which I just catch up.

121
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:07,998
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, okay It's probably still the best comic that's currently being published in the United States.

122
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:11,432
Speaker 1: next time I'm over there you at United States over there to judge anime.

123
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,173
Speaker 0: I'll pick up the trades where I left off and the.

124
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,147
Speaker 1: Anyway, really good comic book writer.

125
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:18,692
Speaker 1: He's also written other things.

126
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:19,915
Speaker 1: He worked on some TV shows.

127
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:21,260
Speaker 1: I think whatever he.

128
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:25,740
Speaker 1: Apparently, I don't know this hasn't been confirmed or something, but it's being reported.

129
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,312
Speaker 1: But there's gonna be a live-action Gundam movie, which is almost.

130
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,319
Speaker 1: you hear that and you're like well shit show.

131
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:36,519
Speaker 1: Granted, I mean on one hand every lie every like most Gundam stuff is recent is yeah.

132
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:44,400
Speaker 1: On one hand my default random that isn't like just a TV series is definitely gonna be chitchat.

133
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,640
Speaker 0: My default reaction to they're making a live-action of an anime is it's bad.

134
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,671
Speaker 0: But then I was surprised because battle angel Alita was good.

135
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:53,553
Speaker 0: You see it.

136
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:54,817
Speaker 0: I did not see it.

137
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:55,920
Speaker 1: How do you know so?

138
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,616
Speaker 0: Everyone I trust who has seen it has said middling to great reviews.

139
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:02,820
Speaker 0: No one has said it is bad.

140
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:07,280
Speaker 1: So people said about a lot of things that's but I am that is shocking.

141
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:19,447
Speaker 1: The problem is it is yeah The point is the problem is that the flaw of the thing a Gundam things that suck right is Usually the bad writing.

142
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:26,269
Speaker 1: so the fact that they have put an excellent writer on it Means that there is some potential here.

143
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:31,465
Speaker 1: if this is real and it happened the problem is for this Gundam because it's Gundam.

144
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:34,232
Speaker 0: how much leash will Brian gave on have?

145
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,860
Speaker 1: how much does Brian cave on know about Gundam?

146
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, I imagine he's right watching Gundam right now to get up to speed But what if he'd?

147
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,412
Speaker 0: what if no one told him which got him to watch?

148
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,319
Speaker 0: what if he's just watching like f90?

149
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:51,720
Speaker 1: Feeling that a dude who has written such comics as ultimate x-men knows what a Gundam is and knows how to watch a gun?

150
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think he needs help.

151
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:54,094
Speaker 1: I don't.

152
00:08:54,114 --> 00:09:03,002
Speaker 1: I think he knows how to internet Yeah, but at the same time he might know he might be like how war in the pocket And I'm sure he can ask them for like you know access to any Gundams He needs to see.

153
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,905
Speaker 1: they'll just give them to him.

154
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,573
Speaker 0: Let's see tentatively titled mobile suit Gundam.

155
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,382
Speaker 1: you see - Right so this would come.

156
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,251
Speaker 1: this is a unicorn - so that already is not.

157
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,157
Speaker 1: it happens in the universal century.

158
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:20,595
Speaker 0: like you know Original Gundam is a project that would have an quote overseas drama format.

159
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,300
Speaker 0: the hell is an overseas drop.

160
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:22,942
Speaker 1: Well, that's what.

161
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,047
Speaker 1: no the for the jet.

162
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:30,229
Speaker 1: the Japanese see it as overseas drama so for them It basically means live-action American thing.

163
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:35,565
Speaker 0: yeah, right because they take place in the UC 0104.

164
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:37,815
Speaker 1: okay, so if you think about original Gundam is what 78?

165
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:42,191
Speaker 1: yeah 104 is like 30.

166
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:46,055
Speaker 0: I prefer the Gundam seed calendar The cosmic era.

167
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,944
Speaker 0: yeah That was what.

168
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,530
Speaker 0: just gonna see it and gonna see destiny.

169
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,936
Speaker 0: There's nothing else in that one rights.

170
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:51,820
Speaker 1: It's cosmic era.

171
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's nothing else in cosmic era.

172
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,898
Speaker 1: Universal Century is real Gundam.

173
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:55,240
Speaker 1: nothing.

174
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,760
Speaker 0: Nothing happened in that era since what I saw and what I chose it doesn't say seed in the title.

175
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,239
Speaker 1: It didn't happen in the cosmic era.

176
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,497
Speaker 1: I mean there's a probably bunch of mangas that happened in the cosmic era that you were never gonna read.

177
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:09,140
Speaker 0: all right cosmic.

178
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,532
Speaker 1: I got a Bunch of manga like astray whatever and yeah, it's just.

179
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:15,736
Speaker 0: it's what I know.

180
00:10:15,796 --> 00:10:19,133
Speaker 1: there's nothing new there, right It's all and everything has the word seed in the title.

181
00:10:19,173 --> 00:10:23,509
Speaker 0: if it's in cosmic era yep Yeah, bunch of manga side stories.

182
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all like.

183
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,860
Speaker 0: and a photo novel.

184
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:27,711
Speaker 1: Okay, sure okay.

185
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:28,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

186
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:37,853
Speaker 1: Second news is Galaxy Express 3 9. one of the best animes there is right my one of my favorite.

187
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,220
Speaker 1: Maybe my favorite lazy Matsumoto thing.

188
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:46,617
Speaker 0: Scott likes the slow space drama long shot of someone just walking.

189
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,465
Speaker 1: anyway It's the galaxy.

190
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:49,833
Speaker 1: sister 9 is a TV series.

191
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,160
Speaker 1: You can still watch it on crunchyroll.

192
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:52,145
Speaker 1: There's movies.

193
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,803
Speaker 1: they came out discotheque put them out on DVD ways back Right.

194
00:10:55,883 --> 00:11:18,218
Speaker 1: but recently and here's a Twitter thread of the people who did it they worked real hard To basically redo the movies and put out brand new HD bureaus that are like perfect and amazing better subtitles all kinds of extras included in the burei like you can get a Ticket to ride on the galaxy express in the D. It's like an extra in the DVD box like a little piece of paper, right?

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,734
Speaker 1: Really cute to do that.

196
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,507
Speaker 1: So that's pretty amazing.

197
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,880
Speaker 1: I you know you read the thread of the people who did it.

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Speaker 1: They clearly tried really hard cared a lot did a good job right makes you want to watch them again all redone and stuff.

199
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,754
Speaker 1: But they put it out on burei only.

200
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:42,300
Speaker 1: so I'm like hey I don't never gonna buy a burei in my life where I want to watch it streaming or downloading.

201
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,004
Speaker 1: I'll even pay.

202
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,839
Speaker 1: I'll pay money for this because you you have done great works.

203
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,640
Speaker 1: And this is out now by the way in the United States in English.

204
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,248
Speaker 1: Where can I watch it like go to Amazon Prime.

205
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,980
Speaker 1: so good Amazon Prime and I see an Amazon Prime.

206
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,188
Speaker 1: I got the DVD that I already own from discotheque.

207
00:11:57,248 --> 00:12:00,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see the burei that was just released for 20 bucks, right?

208
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:09,546
Speaker 1: And it's - it's this two movies this galaxy Express, and then this I do Galaxy Express yep, so it's like two movies anyway I don't know if they did.

209
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,635
Speaker 1: there's like another thing that I've never watched.

210
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:18,440
Speaker 1: the third thing That's like something destiny something I forget whatever the point is.

211
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,811
Speaker 1: Or is it Endless Odyssey or something like that?

212
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,178
Speaker 1: I don't know.

213
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:25,466
Speaker 1: I forget I've never seen it doesn't?

214
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:27,640
Speaker 1: you don't need to see that these two movies are what's important.

215
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,549
Speaker 1: And then I see like watch the movie.

216
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,515
Speaker 1: There's multiple prime video links.

217
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:40,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, and one of them Looks like it's clearly based on discotheque because the art is similar to the art.

218
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,455
Speaker 1: That's on the DVD and the burei.

219
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,992
Speaker 1: But is it from the new burei?

220
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:52,460
Speaker 1: because if it's from the new burei, then I'll watch it But if it's from the DVD then I'm not gonna watch it cuz I already have the DVD.

221
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've already seen that a long time ago, right, and it just works.

222
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,510
Speaker 1: It's just like an Amazon Prime thing, but then this is other link to watch the movie that has completely different Artwork on Amazon.

223
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:07,091
Speaker 1: right and if you click on that You can't watch it even if you have Amazon Prime.

224
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:11,926
Speaker 1: It says get viewster anime Included with viewster for some.

225
00:13:11,966 --> 00:13:19,908
Speaker 1: what $4 a month a month after a seven-day free trial, but it's like What if this is on Amazon Prime?

226
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:20,450
Speaker 1: Why is it?

227
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,180
Speaker 1: Why is it like this viewster thing going on?

228
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,932
Speaker 0: I never heard of viewster right the head anime.

229
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:29,869
Speaker 0: Oh wow if I go to viewster calm It's got a fucking broken certificate.

230
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay, but it's like okay.

231
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,065
Speaker 1: They got rid of that anime.

232
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,232
Speaker 0: Sorry the CN is like not valid.

233
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,440
Speaker 1: they got rid of the anime strike thing.

234
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,668
Speaker 1: so what the hell's up with this viewster thing?

235
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:48,000
Speaker 1: and how can I tell if you've got a Movie that's on prime viewster might be compromised?

236
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:48,642
Speaker 0: There's something.

237
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:59,785
Speaker 0: this actually the certificate here for viewster calm is from viewster calm dot something dot simple helix dot net You don't?

238
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,411
Speaker 1: it sounds like they're really bad at the web.

239
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,998
Speaker 0: They're either really bad, or they got hacked.

240
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:03,520
Speaker 0: I don't know.

241
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,295
Speaker 1: I think they're just bad.

242
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,897
Speaker 1: Simple helix is probably their hosting company.

243
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:11,052
Speaker 1: they prob That's the certificates bright based on the original hostname not in their DNS.

244
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway that happens a lot because people are dumb.

245
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:30,176
Speaker 1: The point is I feel like they need to do a better job of telling you when you go to watch something on You know a streaming site or a download place like hey This is ripped from this bure or this DVD or this film or

246
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,138
Speaker 0: but usually they don't.

247
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:31,800
Speaker 0: there's no way to know.

248
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,900
Speaker 0: You'll see multiple streaming options multiple physical options and the streaming options are just the movie.

249
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,110
Speaker 0: They might even all be called the exact same thing.

250
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:39,532
Speaker 1: so it's like.

251
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,100
Speaker 1: I've seen this movie many times.

252
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:46,786
Speaker 1: I only want to rewatch it if I get to see that great new Remastered redone bure version.

253
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:50,460
Speaker 0: and if that period is that other one is eternal fantasy, okay?

254
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,829
Speaker 0: You can buy a DVD in English.

255
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've never seen it.

256
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:53,863
Speaker 1: It's I wonder I want.

257
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,900
Speaker 1: I don't know if they redid that one also or not, and I don't know what happens in it.

258
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,740
Speaker 0: We get a new one for a hundred and ten dollars.

259
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,085
Speaker 0: Yeah No Based on the original story by L.A.

260
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:04,496
Speaker 0: Drew Matsumoto picks up one year after the events of ado right.

261
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:11,352
Speaker 1: so if you don't know if You've never seen any Galaxy Express Right the three movies are sort of separate from like.

262
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:13,940
Speaker 1: they don't tell exactly the same story as the TV show.

263
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:15,988
Speaker 1: It's almost like if you had.

264
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,920
Speaker 1: you know this is the original manga, and then it's like all right.

265
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,109
Speaker 1: We'll make it into three movies all right.

266
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,659
Speaker 1: We'll make it into a TV show and they really have like nothing to do.

267
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:28,120
Speaker 1: It's like it's like two separate adaptations that like that.

268
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,329
Speaker 1: It's not like they're inserted or anything right.

269
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,840
Speaker 0: very their experiences in and of themselves.

270
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like in the TV show.

271
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,794
Speaker 1: Tetsuro is a potato in the movie.

272
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,817
Speaker 1: He is not a potato.

273
00:15:37,998 --> 00:15:40,357
Speaker 0: yep He is such a potato though.

274
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:47,247
Speaker 0: So and the manga is a potato, but this will remember this question of wait How do I watch this?

275
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:48,553
Speaker 0: which one of these do I click on?

276
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,160
Speaker 0: because it's gonna come up again in this episode.

277
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:57,600
Speaker 0: Another interesting news is that Funimation said they're gonna release a Dragon Ball Z blu-ray collector's edition.

278
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,959
Speaker 1: So is that all of the original Dragon Ball Z?

279
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,835
Speaker 0: Yeah the 30th anniversary collector's edition.

280
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:12,768
Speaker 1: so a full set of blu-rays So you can watch all of Dragon Ball Z. not Dragon Ball not Dragon Ball GT or any other Dragon Ball But just Z every episode.

281
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,702
Speaker 1: I believe so original Japanese unedited original music Titles.

282
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:22,408
Speaker 0: they're like changing the aspect ratio.

283
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,519
Speaker 0: there was some debate about four by three or sixteen by nine.

284
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,911
Speaker 1: The original last video show is four by three.

285
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,579
Speaker 1: I feel like you shouldn't be stretching was it?

286
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,718
Speaker 0: Are you sure it was on Japanese television?

287
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:32,980
Speaker 0: Yeah?

288
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,264
Speaker 1: Which is square television.

289
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,590
Speaker 0: Funimation announced they release it.

290
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,040
Speaker 0: the release had planned to keep the four by three aspect ratio.

291
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,898
Speaker 0: Yeah But Funimation only released the first two volumes for suspending production.

292
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,560
Speaker 0: on that They said they had to suspend it due to technical challenges of restoring from the original film frame by frame.

293
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:48,985
Speaker 0: It was too expensive.

294
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:49,547
Speaker 0: they gave up.

295
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:56,752
Speaker 0: they later released it on a nine blu-ray disc thing in 2013 But that changed it to a 16 by 9 aspect ratio.

296
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:59,220
Speaker 1: So is it like cropping the top and bottom off of everything?

297
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:01,479
Speaker 0: Hell if I know I don't need to watch Dragon Ball Z again.

298
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:03,365
Speaker 0: Okay, but the news.

299
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,114
Speaker 1: even watch Dragon Ball Z to begin with I only see.

300
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:08,099
Speaker 1: I've only seen like a few episodes here and there.

301
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:12,440
Speaker 0: I watched every episode where Krillin is laying on the ground yelling while someone else is fighting.

302
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:16,220
Speaker 1: I've watched episodes where people are up in the air glowing yellow and going.

303
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,528
Speaker 0: I saw episodes where Frieza was in them.

304
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are the ones and I never saw.

305
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,920
Speaker 1: that's like the white lizard II dude, right?

306
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like the Mewtwo, yeah, yeah, it's like I'm not gonna lie.

307
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:30,324
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that.

308
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:36,489
Speaker 1: I've seen maybe less than 20 Dragon Ball Z's and none of them None of those episodes were adjacent to each other.

309
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:42,852
Speaker 0: I saw hunks of Dragon Ball Z because it was on like right before Sailor Moon, which I was watching when Dragon Ball Z was on.

310
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:45,000
Speaker 1: I usually went to a different channel to watch something else.

311
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,300
Speaker 0: Yep, usually I'd catch the end of a Dragon Ball Z episode.

312
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:57,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I wanted to I usually wanted to watch what was before or after Dragon Ball Z. I think I don't remember exactly but I think it was Dragon Ball Z would end it and then I would watch Vitesse.

313
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:58,143
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

314
00:17:58,324 --> 00:17:59,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that was.

315
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,260
Speaker 0: it might have been a different era because I remember it was Dragon Ball Z and then Sailor Moon.

316
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:07,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, no Sailor Moon was on like our local but anyway Yeah it depends on when you're watching.

317
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:14,971
Speaker 0: because remember that Sailor Moon R came out and then there was the episodes after the Tree saga that like people hadn't seen in the u.s.

318
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:28,720
Speaker 1: On Toonami at the beginning of Toonami I would watch the old shows the thundar the barbarian and the Voltron and then I would stop watching when it was the Tenchi Dragon Ball zone in the middle and then I would come back after dinner for B-TAS and other stuff.

319
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,305
Speaker 0: I didn't watch Tenchi because I'd already seen every Tenchi by then Fucking fansubs of Tenchi.

320
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:38,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that was Tenchi was a show.

321
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:40,140
Speaker 0: I was really into in like high school.

322
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:45,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was even reading that pretty bad manga with like yakage or whatever.

323
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what that is.

324
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:51,500
Speaker 0: It's the villain who's pretty remarkably similar to the villain in the villain in the second OAV.

325
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:55,580
Speaker 1: I only know what Tenchi looks like and what the girl with the big blue hair looks like and that's it.

326
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,692
Speaker 1: I don't know any other characters.

327
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,032
Speaker 0: Was it the one who seemed kind of evil?

328
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:00,514
Speaker 0: Yes.

329
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was.

330
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:01,640
Speaker 0: that's the good one.

331
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:02,323
Speaker 1: That's the only.

332
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:03,710
Speaker 1: I was the only characters I know from that show.

333
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,800
Speaker 0: There's another girl with big blue hair who was different.

334
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,720
Speaker 0: So if I see those characters, there's a third character with big blue hair who was different still.

335
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:12,373
Speaker 1: Oh, I know and that's the girl who's technically way too old, right?

336
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sasami That's the other girl with blue hair.

337
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:16,024
Speaker 1: It was the only.

338
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,216
Speaker 1: and those the only things that I will recognize and say that's Tenchi.

339
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,782
Speaker 1: if I don't see any of those Things I don't know.

340
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,063
Speaker 1: It's ten.

341
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,932
Speaker 0: You'd probably recognize the little cat thing.

342
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:25,838
Speaker 0: Maybe like the Cabot half rat rabbit.

343
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,875
Speaker 0: That's from that show, but technically she is a spaceship.

344
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,566
Speaker 0: So okay Also, she also tries to bone Tenchi.

345
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,188
Speaker 1: Okay.

346
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,575
Speaker 0: Anyway, the news is not.

347
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:39,160
Speaker 0: I don't get anything to say about Dragon Ball.

348
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:47,250
Speaker 0: The news is that Funimation said they're only gonna even make This collector's edition if they get 2,500 pre-orders.

349
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,715
Speaker 0: I'm sure they'll get 2,500 pre-orders.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,391
Speaker 0: Yeah I think that's.

351
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:52,240
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of nerds.

352
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,220
Speaker 1: It makes sense cuz like there's not too much demand for this and clearly it's a pain in the ass for them to make it.

353
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,825
Speaker 1: Dragon Ball Z is a lot of work.

354
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,070
Speaker 1: There's a lot of episodes.

355
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

356
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,920
Speaker 1: It's like it seems seems like a lot of work.

357
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:07,235
Speaker 1: I feel like you wouldn't do it unless you knew for sure you had that enough nerds.

358
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,580
Speaker 1: That's not a very large number.

359
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,332
Speaker 1: I feel like there's definitely enough Dragon Ball fans.

360
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:11,117
Speaker 1: They'll meet the number.

361
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:17,805
Speaker 0: Yep so they pointedly said they're not gonna do like a Kickstarter or something because They don't want to just like.

362
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,595
Speaker 0: like that would be asking fans to fund new content.

363
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's through.

364
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:21,900
Speaker 1: now just do pre-orders.

365
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like until there's enough pre-orders.

366
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:28,652
Speaker 0: We won't start working on it Yeah, which I think more companies should do for this kind of thing.

367
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,215
Speaker 0: This is great.

368
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,560
Speaker 1: You don't have to pay a fee to Kickstarter.

369
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,736
Speaker 1: So someone's claiming there's a problem with this.

370
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:33,179
Speaker 1: They're mad.

371
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:40,869
Speaker 0: The people I saw who seemed to be mad about this seem to be people who are best ignored in all cases in all things.

372
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 1: in all cases I mean, I seem to remember the exact same thing happening or a similar thing.

373
00:20:46,324 --> 00:21:04,332
Speaker 1: I could be wrong about this But I remember when I bought the Macross DVDs from anime ego way back in the early 2000s You know, I pre-ordered those for like $300 Of 2000s money when I was pouring in college, but I had to order that anyway, which is I don't regret that I still have those.

374
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,020
Speaker 0: I remember that.

375
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,700
Speaker 1: Well, I mean up until then there was no no way to get that right.

376
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:11,910
Speaker 0: There wasn't even like YouTube.

377
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:12,635
Speaker 1: Right?

378
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:13,320
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

379
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:20,640
Speaker 1: And I seem to remember them like not having I could be wrong but a vague, you know, 20 year old memory.

380
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,562
Speaker 1: But I seem to remember them like having I got a number and like if they didn't get that many then they wouldn't Wouldn't like, you know do it God What was?

381
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:30,186
Speaker 0: I don't.

382
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,000
Speaker 1: or maybe that was just the number of that they were gonna make.

383
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,747
Speaker 1: They would sell out.

384
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't remember which one it was.

385
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:37,580
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

386
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:42,160
Speaker 0: That was so long ago that that was such a different era of reality from today.

387
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,882
Speaker 1: That's what.

388
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:48,020
Speaker 1: I kept all the discs, but and I ripped I think all the discs to digital.

389
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,245
Speaker 1: But I still have them.

390
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:52,920
Speaker 1: and but I I kept all the there's like there was like liner notes.

391
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:53,486
Speaker 1: They came with.

392
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,173
Speaker 1: I kept those.

393
00:21:54,214 --> 00:22:00,460
Speaker 1: they were fancy Yeah, but all the DVD boxes and the the cardboard box that they all went in I got rid of that.

394
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I ended up getting rid of too much space.

395
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,540
Speaker 0: I got rid of every cardboard box for every DVD I own and put them in sleeves.

396
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:12,330
Speaker 0: But now I have a two inch thick binder of sleeves with a shit ton of DVDs That I feel like I should just rip and then throw away.

397
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,680
Speaker 1: I just keep it, you know in a place.

398
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:15,600
Speaker 0: I keep it in a place.

399
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:24,735
Speaker 0: But I feel like it might be worth it to just set up a PC and just Script it where I just put a DVD and it just rips it and puts it on the NAS Rip every DVD I own and just get rid of the last of them and

400
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,750
Speaker 1: some of those DVDs I feel like I need like my Windows 95 B CD.

401
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:34,052
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm only talking about my moon-based commander CD wrong.

402
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,577

Speaker 1: I got the code.

406
00:22:43,498 --> 00:22:44,060
Speaker 1: I don't have the joke.

Speaker 0: I still have that CD.

413
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,620
Speaker 0: Maybe I should put all those on YouTube if they're not there.

414
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,778
Speaker 0: But first things of the day, what do you got?

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,671
Speaker 1: What do I got?

416
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,199
Speaker 0: All right.

417
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:25,050
Speaker 1: So if you don't know who Fritz Lang is you got problem.

418
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:32,720
Speaker 1: Fritz Lang is like one of the best movie directors there ever was Directed such great famous films like metropolis like the original one.

419
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:39,179
Speaker 1: Yeah M just the letter M that's the name of the movie when the greatest movies there is and a movie I've more recently just.

420
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,122
Speaker 1: I mean Not.

421
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,350
Speaker 1: I mean not saying I personally discovered this movie.

422
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,899
Speaker 1: I'm saying other people knew about this movie.

423
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,827
Speaker 1: clearly I didn't know about it until maybe like a year ago.

424
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,552
Speaker 1: the testament of dr.

425
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:52,240
Speaker 1: Mabu is a which is like amazing this movie.

426
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,103
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you mentioned that I didn't watch Series.

427
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,230
Speaker 1: of three movies one was made in the late 20s.

428
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:02,096
Speaker 1: the one that I saw was made in like the early 30s And then there was a third one that was made in like that 60s.

429
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,760
Speaker 1: I only saw the middle one and it was amazing.

430
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:08,440
Speaker 1: He's also made a lot of other very very famous amazing movies.

431
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:12,698
Speaker 1: not a lot of them are listed on this page not all of which I've seen because it's hard to see them.

432
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:24,571
Speaker 1: but Fritz Lang was famous for not being interviewed very often because he said look if your artwork Doesn't speak for itself and you need to give like an interview to explain your work You didn't do a very good job.

433
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:24,895
Speaker 1: Did you?

434
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,420
Speaker 1: Right.

435
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:27,827
Speaker 1: That was his philosophy, right?

436
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,072
Speaker 0: So he did that philosophy, right?

437
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:32,354
Speaker 1: He wasn't about trying to make himself famous He was about trying to just make movies.

438
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:35,278
Speaker 1: So There weren't a lot of interviews with him.

439
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:38,410
Speaker 1: maybe there was only one and there was this.

440
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:52,552
Speaker 1: basically there was this one interview with him ever and and I think no one had seen this interview or you know the contents of it until like early 2000s and I Remember seeing it around then and it wasn't.

441
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:53,115
Speaker 1: it was like.

442
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:54,360
Speaker 1: it wasn't the whole thing.

443
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,897
Speaker 1: It was like just a portion right and now in 2019 15 years later.

444
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:00,860
Speaker 1: It's like, all right.

445
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:04,710
Speaker 1: Here's the whole the transcript of the whole interview the whole thing.

446
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:10,806
Speaker 1: So this is pretty much all you're gonna get Is long.

447
00:25:11,068 --> 00:25:11,570
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read this.

448
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:22,168
Speaker 1: it's pretty much like the only time Fritz Lang ever sat down and talked to anyone on the record that it was recorded While skimming these already Comparing him to say Kunihiko Ikuhara.

449
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,360
Speaker 0: He gives the exact opposite kind of answer.

450
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:29,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Ikuhara would be like you'd have to ask Toga.

451
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:35,744
Speaker 0: There's no way for me to answer that question because I can't speak for Toga Fritz Lang here.

452
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,217
Speaker 0: It's just like if the movie didn't say it like what do you want?

453
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:45,328
Speaker 0: Hey Yeah, I Don't know what he's got a Monica.

454
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,051
Speaker 0: I don't know.

455
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:47,317
Speaker 0: That's a real good picture.

456
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,371
Speaker 1: Yeah exactly what you expect him to look like.

457
00:25:50,512 --> 00:25:59,640
Speaker 0: yep, so If you like all good sane people read the first do novel possibly because you know, it's a classic of all time.

458
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,929
Speaker 0: I didn't read it until recently both of us.

459
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:02,652
Speaker 0: We did a book club.

460
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,560
Speaker 1: I tried to read it in middle school and did not like.

461
00:26:05,441 --> 00:26:07,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still only you know, it's I.

462
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:15,433
Speaker 0: I like it a lot but Unlike every other but like many of its ideas every other book club book.

463
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,035
Speaker 1: We're not all.

464
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:17,439
Speaker 0: yeah, not all the games.

465
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:17,640
Speaker 1: better.

466
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:24,451
Speaker 0: yeah, some of the ideas that had were just a product of their time and a Could be done better shall we say.

467
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:27,710
Speaker 1: but everything I've heard about the other dune books I haven't read has been bad.

468
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,616
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna read them.

469
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:37,478
Speaker 0: Yep I think someone did I someone in our forum described the further dune books as a train wreck that you want to look away from But you just can't and you have to.

470
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:38,965
Speaker 0: yes I can I don't.

471
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,440
Speaker 0: I'm not force yourself to look away and go read a newspaper the next day instead.

472
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,585
Speaker 1: I have not looked at it.

473
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:45,595
Speaker 1: I haven't had to force myself anything.

474
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:55,460
Speaker 0: It is telling that There's a trend in the gig nights book club where we read the first book of a series and then I just go on and Read the entire wheel of time after that like just instantly.

475
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:58,237
Speaker 0: I did not read any more dune books after we did dune.

476
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:01,860
Speaker 0: I feel like dune ended at a place where I did not need more dune.

477
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:10,189
Speaker 0: But if you are the kind of person who wants to know what happened in the dune universe But is smart enough to not read all the dune books.

478
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:12,116
Speaker 0: Here's a 10-minute YouTube video.

479
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,180
Speaker 1: No only 10 minutes.

480
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,740
Speaker 1: When you say I saw you were choosing this is a thing of your day.

481
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,226
Speaker 1: I'm like, I am NOT watching this but now that I know it's only 10 minutes It's like I got 10 minutes.

482
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:24,684
Speaker 0: and what it does is it doesn't just go through the books It's actually much broader.

483
00:27:24,804 --> 00:27:26,649
Speaker 0: It just takes from all the books.

484
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:30,400
Speaker 0: What is the entire chronological order of events?

485
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:37,140
Speaker 0: from the beginning of Anything mentioned in the series beginning of time well to the Roman Empire.

486
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,231
Speaker 0: That's when that's the earliest thing that happens in dune.

487
00:27:40,352 --> 00:27:42,600
Speaker 0: Okay happens in the Roman Empire.

488
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:43,704
Speaker 1: That's news to me.

489
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:44,347
Speaker 1: But all right.

490
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:50,891
Speaker 0: Yep, and this just moves along and covers the 34,000 years of the dune universe.

491
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:53,060
Speaker 0: the Butlerian Jihad is like right away.

492
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,907
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Roman part isn't a lot of content.

493
00:27:56,228 --> 00:28:00,880
Speaker 0: No, the Rome part is yeah Rome then the Land Strad in space.

494
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:06,680
Speaker 1: Okay Only because none of the time in between was covered in any of the books.

495
00:28:06,883 --> 00:28:07,757
Speaker 1: So there's nothing to say about.

496
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:11,130
Speaker 0: yeah It'd be like if I was covering human history and I was like so.

497
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:17,293
Speaker 0: a monolith fell down then monkeys discovered warfare Then World War two happens moon landing.

498
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:20,763
Speaker 1: So that brings us to things Met a moment.

499
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:21,065
Speaker 1: Yep.

500
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:24,598
Speaker 0: So the meta moment the geek nights book club book is 2001 a space Odyssey.

501
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,257
Speaker 1: I finished reading it for Thursday, but then rim bailed and didn't finish reading it.

502
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:29,960
Speaker 1: He's bad.

503
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:34,140
Speaker 0: I will be done with this book because I've been mostly done with it as of now.

504
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,811
Speaker 1: Guess what next Thursday when we do an episode on it.

505
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,840
Speaker 1: We're doing that episode whether you read it or not.

506
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:39,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, fine.

507
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:54,517
Speaker 0: The funniest thing about this book so far because I'm near the end is Every time a character talks about it mostly happens only in the first half of the book the price of something Like oh that was it.

508
00:28:54,557 --> 00:28:55,865
Speaker 0: That's a $50,000 person we invested in.

509
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:56,649
Speaker 0: it's really funny.

510
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:04,843
Speaker 1: But I mean, it's not funny enough that it's 2001.

511
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,314
Speaker 1: Everything in it still seems futuristic even though it's currently 2019.

512
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:12,936
Speaker 0: Yeah Well everything in it feels futuristic except information technology and the book is from like the 60s.

513
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,402
Speaker 0: Yeah It's.

514
00:29:14,663 --> 00:29:23,967
Speaker 1: this is another thought cuz I mean if you look at the the rate of space technology Progression that was happening at that time right pre Person on moon time.

515
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:27,239
Speaker 0: Yep, like before we kind of paused that work, right?

516
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:29,769
Speaker 1: They saw the space race.

517
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,000
Speaker 1: It's accelerating and they projected forward.

518
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,730
Speaker 1: He's like, well, we keep developing our space technology at the rate We're doing it now, you know that we should be.

519
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,521
Speaker 1: this is what the kind of stuff we'll have by 2001.

520
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:42,276
Speaker 1: We should be going to Jupiter and Saturn rim only make sense.

521
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:48,556
Speaker 1: Yeah Typewriters didn't foresee that we would space shuttle and then not even space shuttle.

522
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,679
Speaker 0: We still got casual sexism and typewriters.

523
00:29:55,564 --> 00:30:01,206
Speaker 0: So, yeah Otherwise, we will be in Two weeks three weeks three weeks.

524
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:04,737
Speaker 0: Well two weeks at zenk icon geek nights will be doing panels.

525
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:16,465
Speaker 0: I still have to Remember to look up what panels I'm doing So I know to prepare them and to show up for them and I have to repair the panel for PAX East the week after Yeah, but PAX East on Friday.

526
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:19,980
Speaker 0: We will be doing the real harm of games.

527
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:24,010
Speaker 0: What harm did people tell us games would do that?

528
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,153
Speaker 0: They may or may not have done.

529
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,198
Speaker 1: and what harm do games do?

530
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:32,039
Speaker 0: Yep, and The answers may surprise you they may shock and alarm you.

531
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had what I wanted to say, but then I found that I was wrong.

532
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,048
Speaker 1: It's not changing what I'm gonna say.

533
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,923
Speaker 0: Holy shit geek nights panel that Research.

534
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:42,672
Speaker 1: usually it's come up with my ten minutes of research.

535
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,240
Speaker 0: Usually our panel structure is come up with an idea.

536
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:56,580
Speaker 0: Do come up with the thesis that we're going to present then cherry-pick evidence cherry-pick evidence and find all the images We need and all the things to talk about it and then we're good.

537
00:30:56,861 --> 00:31:00,614
Speaker 0: But in this case, it was come up with the thesis then do research then.

538
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:01,477
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

539
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:02,460
Speaker 0: Our topic is now.

540
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,032
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I couldn't even find any evidence that I agree with.

541
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:06,574
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

542
00:31:06,594 --> 00:31:08,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I'll change my thesis.

543
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,246
Speaker 0: I guess I got.

544
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,199
Speaker 0: I guess I gotta change my world view.

545
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:12,002
Speaker 1: I can't.

546
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:12,986
Speaker 1: I can't.

547
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:16,500
Speaker 0: I can't just say the games don't cause the panels already been accepted.

548
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:17,965
Speaker 1: Oops, I guess I can't.

549
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:19,510
Speaker 1: I can't do a different panel.

550
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,132
Speaker 0: short answer.

551
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:25,854
Speaker 0: games do and have caused harm But it is as far as we can tell not the harm.

552
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:28,392
Speaker 0: Anyone said it was Pretty much.

553
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:32,111
Speaker 0: Yeah You'll see it's gonna be a good panel brand new panel.

554
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:33,618
Speaker 0: So we're excited about it real fan.

555
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:38,873
Speaker 1: Yep And you know that Grimm's panel do it, you know, clickbait for top 40 list.

556
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,239
Speaker 0: Well top 40 list is a pretty popular panel.

557
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:52,440
Speaker 0: Clickbait not real because I think what someone impact said that was interesting is the the clickbait title panel.

558
00:31:52,821 --> 00:32:04,054
Speaker 0: That tricks people into a more serious discussion like people come to the panel who wouldn't otherwise come and oh shit It's actually serious or it's actually the real harm of games is click baity enough.

559
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:05,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's click baity and it's right.

560
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:09,777
Speaker 1: You're gonna need you're gonna need someone to save you a click and tell you what the harms were.

561
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:16,119
Speaker 0: Yeah But our nostalgia first game design panel was very well received and I haven't uploaded all the top 40 lists.

562
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,762
Speaker 0: We've done.

563
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,250
Speaker 0: I gotta edit one of those together.

564
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:20,120
Speaker 0: The board game one is pretty popular.

565
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,599
Speaker 0: Actually, my co-workers have all been looking at that one because they all want to play better games.

566
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:25,185
Speaker 0: All right.

567
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:25,868
Speaker 0: Here we go.

568
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:32,740
Speaker 0: Let me close this nonsense about the cosmic era because The more I learn about the cosmic era the less I care about the cosmic era.

569
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:39,318
Speaker 1: You may know, uh Tomohiko Morimi is someone who we've talked about a lot recently.

570
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:49,360
Speaker 0: Yep So it's one of those authors where you see a bunch of media and then later you find out there's a creator that is related To all of them and you've like you find a thread and you start tugging on right?

571
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,965
Speaker 1: So there's been a bunch of anime right eccentric family.

572
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:56,654
Speaker 1: Yep, eccentric family - yep night on Night is young walk on girl.

573
00:32:56,815 --> 00:33:01,070
Speaker 1: Yep Tommy galaxy - Tommy galaxy, which we're gonna talk about now.

574
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:02,976
Speaker 1: Wasn't there another one penguin highway?

575
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:04,540
Speaker 1: That's coming soon, right?

576
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:04,820
Speaker 1: Yep.

577
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,066
Speaker 0: Anyway, we've seen anime was written in 2010.

578
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:14,940
Speaker 1: We've seen anime based on all these things and Some of those anime have been animated by the same teams, right?

579
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:29,920
Speaker 1: So like Masaki Yuasa, he animated what we're gonna talk about today, which is Tommy galaxy on the galaxy, but also he did walk on girl, which is Very related but also not an eccentric family eccentric family - obviously animated by the same studio.

580
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,853
Speaker 0: I just want to point out if you haven't watched eccentric family.

581
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:35,418
Speaker 0: We reviewed both seasons.

582
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:36,100
Speaker 0: You should go watch it.

583
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,518
Speaker 0: It's one of the best shows to come out.

584
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,094
Speaker 0: It is one of the best anime there is right now.

585
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:55,560
Speaker 1: frog in a well anyway But all of these are based on novels written by Tomohiko Morimi and Hopefully these novels will be just translated so I can read them directly and not just have to watch anime adaptations.

586
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:01,140
Speaker 1: I really want to read the eccentric family novel based on all these anime adaptations of Morimi's work.

587
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:06,228
Speaker 1: I am a fan of Morimi's work indirectly indirect key.

588
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:11,630
Speaker 1: so once I found out because we were when we saw Night a short walk on girl in the theater at the end.

589
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,420
Speaker 1: There's the interview with Yuasa.

590
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:18,408
Speaker 1: He kept bringing up Talking about the time a galaxy and I'm like.

591
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:21,940
Speaker 1: I've heard of tatami galaxy and I haven't watched it.

592
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:23,768
Speaker 1: I think I will go home and watch it.

593
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,600
Speaker 1: So I did and I watched like a handful of episodes.

594
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,728
Speaker 0: I've seen like three and a quarter episode.

595
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:29,953
Speaker 1: I've seen a similar amount.

596
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:40,117
Speaker 1: I'd have to you know, and I haven't finished it, but I've definitely done enough to talk about right because I mean That's more than we usually talk about anime watching less episodes than yep.

597
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:41,862
Speaker 0: Basically, it's we.

598
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:47,858
Speaker 0: either we talk about an anime scene a few episodes or we watch the whole thing as fast as possible And then we talked about it, right?

599
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,080
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't watch this as fast as possible is because I had so many other things to do.

600
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,634
Speaker 1: It's like it, you know, it was con season.

601
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:56,580
Speaker 0: We had a lot of conventions.

602
00:34:56,781 --> 00:35:07,057
Speaker 1: It's like there's other things that kept taking up my time So I couldn't just sit down and watch a whole bunch of anime But every time I got a chance I like squeezed in one episode I only just got like four or five chances.

603
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:13,104
Speaker 1: Yep And now when I want to watch even more of it because I was like, oh, let me go refresh We're gonna do an episode.

604
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:16,156
Speaker 1: I go in crunchyroll and Rym message me today.

605
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,120
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, it ain't there.

606
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,875
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz last night I was like, I've only seen like three episodes.

607
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:21,799
Speaker 0: I should watch a bunch.

608
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,879
Speaker 0: tonight I go to crunchyroll.

609
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:28,260
Speaker 0: Just couldn't find it and I googled around a little bit and I could not find anywhere to watch it legally.

610
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:37,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I would have known it was gonna go off crunchyroll I would have like bailed on something else to watch it before I got taken off and now I'm gonna have to Resort to like piracy or something to watch the rest of the show.

611
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:55,958
Speaker 0: Yep, and I really like it's I. There might be a place to watch it legally, but in a cursory search I was not able to find it and in this day and age if you can't find the legal place to watch it by typing The name of it into Google everyone involved has failed and you can pirate it at that point,

612
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,280
Speaker 1: right?

613
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,752
Speaker 0: But so actually it says availability.

614
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,000
Speaker 0: I think it got taken down.

615
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:09,938
Speaker 1: Sorry due to licensing limitations videos are unavailable in your region All right, so they just I guess the US distribution thing expired maybe whatever.

616
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:16,560
Speaker 0: Yep So that was a shame because I really like this show and I want to watch the rest of it I feel like I'm gonna have to pirate it right.

617
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:23,920
Speaker 1: So the thing is like I said when we were talking about Even though I hadn't watched all this and still haven't watched all of it Like I said, we were talking about walk on girl.

618
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:34,134
Speaker 1: I've said man, you know because I watched a couple episodes of this before we did our walk on girl episode I was like man, you got you it's hard to talk about walk on girl the anime if you haven't seen the time.

619
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:57,591
Speaker 1: the galaxy the anime because Both by you also both based on works from the same author but what you also does here the most notable thing is Similar to Tezuka manga where he'll have the same Characters playing the same quote actors playing different act characters in different things The same exact character designs and maybe even voices.

620
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:58,935
Speaker 1: I have to go verify that.

621
00:36:59,095 --> 00:36:59,697
Speaker 0: I didn't verify.

622
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:03,127
Speaker 1: I didn't verify the voices But there was no disjointedness.

623
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:05,134
Speaker 1: So I feel like it's the same voices.

624
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:07,060
Speaker 1: It's 100% the same character design.

625
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:14,089
Speaker 0: yep, so in walk on girl in both right in walk on girl, there's a dude who is 0.1 steps above being a bum.

626
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:20,149
Speaker 0: Yep, who may or may not Be a magical creature may not.

627
00:37:20,169 --> 00:37:21,634
Speaker 1: he's Tengu adjacent.

628
00:37:21,694 --> 00:37:23,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got like a big old chin.

629
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,580
Speaker 0: Yep, he might just be a bum who through who acts like he's a Tengu, right?

630
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,323
Speaker 0: He might actually be a Tengu.

631
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:31,266
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's a tatami galaxy.

632
00:37:31,386 --> 00:37:31,567
Speaker 1: there.

633
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:36,467
Speaker 0: that person plays someone who's 0.2 steps above being a bum right?

634
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,960
Speaker 0: It's a very similar character who is probably a god.

635
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:48,040
Speaker 1: Yeah You can imagine an eccentric family that you could tell eccentric family with that same character being the Tengu grandpa guy.

636
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,027
Speaker 0: Oh my god that character could you only older.

637
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:59,091
Speaker 0: if you saw any character from eccentric family or tatami galaxy or walk-on girl In the background of the other shows, it just makes sense.

638
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:00,255
Speaker 0: They're all in the same universe.

639
00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:03,675
Speaker 1: for example eccentric family There's the girl who's always like turning into objects.

640
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,259
Speaker 1: You never see her.

641
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,504
Speaker 1: yeah, that could be.

642
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:12,936
Speaker 1: you could use the character design for the girl from walk-on girl or The girl in tatami galaxy for that character.

643
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:19,719
Speaker 1: Yep, right You know main guy in eccentric family main tanuki guy could be main college dude from right, right?

644
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:30,118
Speaker 1: It's like you can see that the author sort of has you know characters that feel similar adjacent ish personalities and roles in their stories.

645
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:37,120
Speaker 1: and Because the same animation team did you know these two anime the time of galaxy and walk-on girl?

646
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,593
Speaker 1: They use the same character designs, right?

647
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:48,737
Speaker 1: There's like devil II guy You know, yeah definitely guy bum buff, dude Buff jock dude earnest male protagonist.

648
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:57,399
Speaker 1: Yep There's a lot of reused character designs from both and the characters that share the designs share personalities quite a bit.

649
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:01,329
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what's the time in galaxy actually freaking about?

650
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:07,876
Speaker 1: so there's this dude and he is looking to have like the perfect Most wonderful college existed.

651
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:08,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, what does he say?

652
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,433
Speaker 0: He wants to go to college and find a raven-haired girlfriend, right?

653
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:14,580
Speaker 1: So he's got these ideas about college.

654
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,772
Speaker 1: He wants college to be like amazing.

655
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,380
Speaker 1: He's he goes to college.

656
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,211
Speaker 1: He's trying to fulfill his dream of you know, what's gonna happen in college.

657
00:39:22,231 --> 00:39:25,018
Speaker 1: So each episode it's an episodic show.

658
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,940
Speaker 1: surprisingly Yeah, I'm sure it's not episodic at the end, but it's episodic at least most of the way.

659
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:32,373
Speaker 1: I've read some like episode descriptions.

660
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:35,889
Speaker 1: each episode He joins a club at the college.

661
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,777
Speaker 1: So this is my favorite so far.

662
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:38,620
Speaker 1: is the bicycling club?

663
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:44,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bike one's good because of how badly it goes Right, but there's other clubs.

664
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:46,000
Speaker 1: He joins like a drama club, right was one of them.

665
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,613
Speaker 0: I think the first three episodes are tennis club a film club film club.

666
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,038
Speaker 0: Remember with the pervert guy, right?

667
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:56,925
Speaker 1: Right, right yeah, anyway, each episode he joins a different club and Crazy stuff happens

668
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,593
Speaker 0: but all in like the same circle like but

669
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:00,375
Speaker 1: the girl

670
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:05,677
Speaker 0: he likes that he Can't talk to is like in the club or right here by

671
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:12,200
Speaker 1: the same Each even though each episode is different in terms of the club he joins and the exact drama that happens.

672
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:26,724
Speaker 1: There's the same format of how the episode breaks down right early and he makes a promise to this girl right and then he's got her like little thing hanging from the from the Pole string on.

673
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:30,840
Speaker 1: his land is low and is thick right and he can't remember to give it back to her.

674
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,612
Speaker 1: You know even though she has the rest of the set he has the.

675
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,758
Speaker 1: he is the one that she's missing.

676
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:40,440
Speaker 1: and Then there's the evil dude comes and makes mischief which looks like a demon.

677
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:50,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, he mess up the clean messes up the club's business right the crazy old Tengu adjacent guy Gets in the who is the best and my favorite character.

678
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:52,496
Speaker 1: Yeah the most rim like character.

679
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a very rim adjacent I love.

680
00:40:54,684 --> 00:41:08,580
Speaker 0: so the description of him in the in this Wikipedia is And it is similar how he's described in the show an eighth-year super senior Mm-hmm, very similar to some people we knew in college ourselves who were still around.

681
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:26,158
Speaker 1: Maybe what point one steps above being a homeless bum somehow still in the school Yeah, but anyway, and I guess you know that character that Tengu ish character is sort of like the mentor master Ish in a way like he's learning from him sort of.

682
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:26,540
Speaker 1: anyway.

683
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:32,100
Speaker 0: I mean the vague gist of it is he sort of gives this ultimatum to the main guy of yo, I'm a god, right?

684
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:36,862
Speaker 0: You're either I'm gonna have you date this girl or that shithead, you know And don't like.

685
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,630
Speaker 0: but you're also best friends with dater, right?

686
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:42,968
Speaker 1: So the episode, you know as he joins the club He's you know, he's trying to do stuff in the club.

687
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:45,057
Speaker 1: He's usually bad at whatever the club is.

688
00:41:45,077 --> 00:41:46,829
Speaker 1: He's bad at biking He's bad at filming.

689
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:47,980
Speaker 1: He's not helping much, right?

690
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:49,223
Speaker 1: He's sort of failing.

691
00:41:49,243 --> 00:42:05,848
Speaker 1: and then you know as things are sort of collapsing because of his failure despite his attempts to succeed in his You know devolving into making mischief instead of participating and being nice and doing a job like the first episode He bumps into the fortune-teller.

692
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:06,551
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:14,867
Speaker 0: I think the first every time I'm pretty sure the fortune-teller Raised her price every episode.

694
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:18,940
Speaker 1: I didn't notice the fortune-telling part is like usually identical every episode.

695
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:27,780
Speaker 1: She says basically the same thing right, yeah every time He feels like he remembers this fortune-teller, but he doesn't do what she says.

696
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,150
Speaker 1: He doesn't do what the fortune-teller says does what else.

697
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,114
Speaker 0: who says instead?

698
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:35,296
Speaker 1: then the whole thing Collapses in a giant climax clusterfuck.

699
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:36,278
Speaker 1: That's amazing Yep.

700
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,386
Speaker 1: and then There's the end of the show.

701
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:49,540
Speaker 1: at the end of the episode happens and the end of the episode is this animation of like time Rewinding and then the next episode it's like he's back at the beginning of college again.

702
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,711
Speaker 1: So he's replaying sort of a Groundhog Day situation Trying to live this perfect college life.

703
00:42:56,455 --> 00:43:04,030
Speaker 1: and even though it's each episode He's joining a different club and things are a little different getting a little crazier a little more Twisted a little more advanced.

704
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,350
Speaker 1: each time you feel like with each episode He's getting closer to not fucking up.

705
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:20,640
Speaker 1: Yep, so far at least in the for, you know I imagine he's not gonna figure it out to the last episode, but You know for the four or five episodes I've seen it's pretty the same structure just different clubs every time.

706
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:26,595
Speaker 1: But it's it's still Fascinating and I can imagine you can just imagine that at the end.

707
00:43:26,635 --> 00:43:29,970
Speaker 1: He's finally gonna get it, right Yep, but what is right?

708
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,760
Speaker 0: What is a perfect college experience?

709
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,572
Speaker 1: Remembering the thing he's forgetting you're doing with the fortune teller says to do because

710
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:40,519
Speaker 0: not to spoil walk-on girl Which has a similar story in some ways

711
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:42,061
Speaker 1: It

712
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:58,598
Speaker 0: sort of has this moral of like your rose-colored glasses of what you wanted versus what you actually wanted versus the complexities of a real world and what actually happens all set to the backdrop of All the kinds of crazy people and crap that happens in college.

713
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:04,821
Speaker 1: Yep So the structure of you know, like walk-on girl isn't doing the time rewinding thing It's the.

714
00:44:04,962 --> 00:44:07,690
Speaker 1: it's it's this four seasons thing.

715
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,180
Speaker 1: this four seasons that play out in one night is the structure.

716
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:19,765
Speaker 1: so here it's a similar thing where there is a time based structure of College playing out and rewinding Right.

717
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:23,380
Speaker 1: So I you know, I guess eccentric family doesn't have this structure.

718
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:42,255
Speaker 0: But the two novels that Yuasa Adapted have some sort of you know time based thing going on, but I guess this and walk-on girl both Really really capture this vague nostalgic feeling I have for my own college life.

719
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:52,660
Speaker 0: and like RIT anime and like that Kind of environment where everything feels bigger and more important than a walk-on girl Also did have a college with a club that was significant, right?

720
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,919
Speaker 0: In the sense of like you see people in clubs who were treating it like it's way more important than it really is.

721
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,209
Speaker 1: Which also makes you think of you know, Utena.

722
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,800
Speaker 0: Yep, but then you see the people post-college.

723
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,429
Speaker 0: Reminiscing on that makes you think of Mahotsukaita.

724
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,158
