1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,929
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday November 9th 2011.

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,255
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,040
Speaker 1: the red line.

4
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:19,778
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:30,532
Speaker 1: So if I had to summarize red line in a sentence, I would say hi this Everybody.

6
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:39,189
Speaker 1: I would say this is the story of a planet called Robo world that is administered by the most incompetent people in the universe.

7
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:45,342
Speaker 1: so Like Robo world fucking up is the real theme of red line.

8
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty much all there is to it.

9
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,375
Speaker 1: Yeah It's amazing.

10
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:50,559
Speaker 1: What goes on?

11
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,390
Speaker 1: the story of red line is so much more insane.

12
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,584
Speaker 0: Well, it's not really isn't about the story of red line, right?

13
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,130
Speaker 0: It's like the story is just an excuse.

14
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:07,066
Speaker 1: Here's what I expected Crazy like animation machine wacky races awesome.

15
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:07,930
Speaker 1: Let's go craziness.

16
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:14,587
Speaker 1: I did not also expect the military of Robo world trying to stop the race and being so incompetent.

17
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:15,169
Speaker 1: Yeah.

18
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:20,248
Speaker 0: So for people don't know right there was this movie called red line that has been hyped.

19
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,559
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know hyped.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,370
Speaker 1: it's been ignored by most of the media.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,174
Speaker 0: Well, it's weird.

22
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:32,810
Speaker 0: right because the fans have been like crazy about it But the everyone else is like it's non-existent, which is why the fans are crazy about it.

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,056
Speaker 0: It's sort of like the hipster thing, right?

24
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,422
Speaker 0: It's it's this cool thing.

25
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,045
Speaker 0: No one knows about.

26
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:43,110
Speaker 0: we got to make everyone know about it And basically they spent a zillion dollars animating it and tons and tons of time and everything.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,041
Speaker 0: But it's like how come they didn't actually push it harder?

28
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,310
Speaker 1: and the worst thing is those us fans to push it.

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:59,900
Speaker 1: This is the kind of movie where if you just took this fucking thing and put it on TV at prime time sometime Just and just market it like check this thing out People would like it for the same reasons.

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,366
Speaker 1: They like to Kara back in the day.

31
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,670
Speaker 0: I mean, yes I mean, it's not as good as a Kara now.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:11,529
Speaker 1: but I'm saying a lot of people who aren't anime fans and wouldn't even really know much about What anime is saw Akira in the theater and thought it was really cool.

33
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I saw a ghost in the shell in the theater and thought it was really talking about this a zillion times.

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,217
Speaker 0: You know all these things like.

35
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:19,370
Speaker 0: how come they don't market the anime to the normal people?

36
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,637
Speaker 0: Yeah, anime movies come around so rarely.

37
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,523
Speaker 1: This is such a poster child of it.

38
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:24,967
Speaker 1: That is a recent example.

39
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:28,338
Speaker 0: Yes But it's kind of weird because I feel like I've been.

40
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,512
Speaker 0: I've been preaching that story of anime movies come around So rarely.

41
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:36,469
Speaker 0: you should watch them all kind of often as in like our enemy who's coming around more often lately.

42
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,378
Speaker 0: More shows about.

43
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,730
Speaker 1: we pretty much watch every anime movie that comes out.

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,680
Speaker 0: Yeah and this one is no exception.

45
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:49,270
Speaker 1: everyone that isn't a Sequel to one piece or Naruto or Pokemon or Pokemon though we did watch.

46
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:53,684
Speaker 1: I've only ever seen one Pokemon movie and that was the one with mommy.

47
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:54,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, the third one.

48
00:02:54,727 --> 00:03:03,223
Speaker 0: I am daddy You are now mommy, but we had echo the sentiments of all the other anime fans people who are like Yeah, red lines the shit.

49
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:03,889
Speaker 0: you got to see this.

50
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,782
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have if you haven't seen it don't even listen to our review.

51
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:11,230
Speaker 1: just go why you can listen the review Yeah, but go watch it cuz I'm gonna spoil some stuff toward the end though.

52
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,315
Speaker 0: But it's been scientifically demonstrated.

53
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:15,099
Speaker 0: spoilers actually increase enjoyment.

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,184
Speaker 1: However, that's one study.

55
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:18,527
Speaker 0: I agree with it.

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,300
Speaker 1: Uh, That doesn't in any way impact the legitimacy of the study.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,927
Speaker 1: You have to repeat studies to prove things.

58
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,096
Speaker 0: I trust it Okay.

59
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,867
Speaker 1: Anyway, captain bias.

60
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:45,030
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, you should just watch the movie without even thinking about it because if you're an anime fan Even if you end up hating this movie You can't call yourself an anime fan if you don't watch one of the more important or bigger budget Movies in the medium of your fandom that has come out in recent memory.

61
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:48,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, also this movie is pretty beautiful.

62
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:55,649
Speaker 1: It harkens back to the old era of Extremely detailed like background characters doing wacky stuff and machines.

63
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,653
Speaker 0: Yeah, they definitely put.

64
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:02,065
Speaker 0: the number one thing about this movie is the animations right and the arts.

65
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,838
Speaker 0: they put a hundred percent effort to It and got a hundred percent quality.

66
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,986
Speaker 1: and not just the foreground a lot of great-looking shows.

67
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:08,247
Speaker 1: today.

68
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,475
Speaker 1: you look in the background There's really nothing going on.

69
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:14,510
Speaker 1: But you look at old anime, especially a lot of the old cell animated stuff.

70
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,990
Speaker 1: You know some guys working on like one bit of the machinery or like one background guy.

71
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,597
Speaker 1: he's got to animate it a little bit and they put a Lot of detail into.

72
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,830
Speaker 0: except when you go to really old anime where it's just a still, you know panning over the still shot.

73
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:36,401
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's an ebb and flow But this has that like every like in these huge crowd scenes during the races every individual dude in the background It's got something going on.

74
00:04:36,663 --> 00:04:42,689
Speaker 0: Yep So, yeah, and it's the thing that really gets you is the colors right because the colors are just.

75
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:57,970
Speaker 0: you know They're a lot like the colors in that Justice League comic that we Justice League number one that recently came out Where everything is just really bright and all sorts of like, you know Sort of like neon ish colors But like darker neon and they have like this really great contrast that is like eye candy all the time.

76
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,844
Speaker 0: And there's plenty of scenes where like, you know, there's all.

77
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:04,950
Speaker 0: it's not super deformed But like there's all sorts of like cartoon deformities.

78
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,610
Speaker 0: You know of the Looney Tunes style like people stretching out when they go really fast in the cars Or all kinds of stuff like that, but without changing the style.

79
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,730
Speaker 0: It's not like they change it into a cartoony style to do cartoony stuff.

80
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,643
Speaker 0: They like keep it in that style and it's like whoa.

81
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:20,065
Speaker 0: Look at that.

82
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,996
Speaker 0: That's crazy So awesome.

83
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,079
Speaker 1: It is pretty crazy.

84
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:27,410
Speaker 1: It's I cannot stress this enough watch this movie.

85
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,986
Speaker 1: But yeah, the story of red line is pretty straightforward.

86
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:36,504
Speaker 1: on its surface There is the yellow line, which is one of many f-zero style.

87
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,450
Speaker 1: anything goes crazy races.

88
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:44,418
Speaker 0: yellow line is basically F-3000 and red line is F1 or f-zero.

89
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,970
Speaker 1: I mean in this case yellow line was a qualifier.

90
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:51,650
Speaker 0: I really I think gonna go play a GameCube f-zero because it really just was the best f-zero.

91
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:52,907
Speaker 0: I've gotten in the mood big time.

92
00:05:53,511 --> 00:06:08,686
Speaker 1: but so at red line is like the race like imagine if the Super Bowl and the World Series and the Stanley Cup and Every f1 race were all combined into one Single winner-take-all event at the Super Bowl of racing and not only that.

93
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:12,050
Speaker 0: but there's no rules Right except get to the end first.

94
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, anything goes.

95
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:18,297
Speaker 0: you can just kill all the other racers if you really want and there's only like eight racers in it Which is kind of weird.

96
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,671
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is f1 is like 20.

97
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,725
Speaker 1: It is partly implied that people dropped out because they didn't want to know that there were.

98
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:31,298
Speaker 0: there were eight people in originally I'm too drunk dropped out because the plot happened Which is the red line.

99
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:35,335
Speaker 0: people decided that the race this year was gonna be held on Robo world.

100
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:41,126
Speaker 1: now to put this into an analogy to the real world That would be as though we had an f1 race.

101
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:56,560
Speaker 1: That was Like yeah blatantly anti-korea like if the race Enraged Korean people culturally like it there and we decided that we were going to host it in North Korea in their capital against their wishes.

102
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,903
Speaker 0: Well, it's like, you know, the red line is like governed by Some you know Oregon the red line or racing organization.

103
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:07,135
Speaker 1: and they're like, yes, let's put it in robo Fucking hate.

104
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:10,610
Speaker 0: like not under the purview of any government whatsoever.

105
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,884
Speaker 0: It's like this independent thing like the galaxy railways its own thing.

106
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:17,997
Speaker 0: So it's like I guess FIFA, right so FIFA is its own thing.

107
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:18,859
Speaker 0: it governs soccer.

108
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,188
Speaker 0: So FIFA was like, yeah, we're putting the World Cup in rims bathroom.

109
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where it's going.

110
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:29,755
Speaker 1: And right now there's no saying they're like It's gonna be in a robo world.

111
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:35,049
Speaker 0: and then the movie gets to rim gets home one day and like Pele's in his bathroom Kicking the soccer ball, you know.

112
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:42,553
Speaker 1: And then it cuts to the high government of robo world and the president is like what the fuck I'm gonna kill.

113
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:43,497
Speaker 1: all of them.

114
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:44,500
Speaker 1: fuck racing.

115
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,203
Speaker 1: This sucks.

116
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:51,230
Speaker 0: He's like anyone if you when you show up I'm going to send the military of robo world to just to kill the people in your race.

117
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:53,740
Speaker 0: So basically the course of the movie.

118
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,469
Speaker 0: if you think the weird if you take the other meaning of the word race You could say robo world was genociding because he was killing an entire race.

119
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,796
Speaker 0: Anyway, that was terrible.

120
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,244
Speaker 0: it was terrible, but the I don't.

121
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:05,930
Speaker 1: I don't want to really like spoil a lot.

122
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,070
Speaker 1: But basically the robo world military and like government apparatus are going to stop this.

123
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,790
Speaker 0: Well, the first which is like which is happening illegally.

124
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,761
Speaker 0: Well, the reason is like why does robo world even want to stop?

125
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,970
Speaker 0: the race wouldn't erase usually boost your economy.

126
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,530
Speaker 1: Well, like I said, just go back to the North Korea analogy.

127
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:29,790
Speaker 1: So not only is the race like in the center of the capital of North Korea But the finish line is on top of their most secret military base, right?

128
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,770
Speaker 0: So basically robo robo world is just really afraid of their military secrets on their planet being shown to the world.

129
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,957
Speaker 1: They also on galaxy-wide television.

130
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:41,130
Speaker 1: They also appear to hate races and hate people, right?

131
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,547
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's a leader of robo world that he's got two assistants one volt.

132
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:46,290
Speaker 0: What's his name?

133
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,033
Speaker 1: Oh a captive court.

134
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:59,090
Speaker 0: colonel volt on right who is colonel volt on is basically sort of like the badass like quiet Powerful evil dude and then the other like Oh Kefka kind of evil, dude.

135
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,469
Speaker 1: I thought that guy was gonna be a square boss, but it turns out he just doesn't give up.

136
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:15,381
Speaker 1: He's just like whatever just a crazy killer, but he keeps coming down Like he'll be like the president's like arm the hyper disintegrator and the guy's like, okay He's like, oh, yeah hyper disintegrator didn't work.

137
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:18,450
Speaker 1: what it was broken by the racers.

138
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,697
Speaker 0: Oh, we can use the disintegrator again.

139
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:28,101
Speaker 1: Now the most he's the second most unflappable guy in the world second only to Machine machine has the best.

140
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,730
Speaker 1: machine head is my favorite character.

141
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,939
Speaker 0: She is my favorite because of all these are seen.

142
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:34,630
Speaker 1: apparently machine head is one the last seven red lines.

143
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:40,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's basically the Tiger Woods Roger Federer Michael Jordan, but he's a giant Michael Schumacher.

144
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,355
Speaker 1: He is his car.

145
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:43,338
Speaker 1: He races.

146
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,444
Speaker 1: He's like, you know, you drive a car.

147
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,813
Speaker 1: I fucking am a car That's right.

148
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,179
Speaker 0: I can't lose a machine head.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:58,522
Speaker 0: and the thing the thing that I liked about machine head Right was the even though he's basically Michael Schumacher Right, and even though he's like that You know the the guy that the real main character has to be in the race.

150
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:07,475
Speaker 0: any other movie ultra in the bad guy exactly, and like if he normally would have been the evil team like in Mighty Ducks or Shaolin soccer, but he wasn't.

151
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:09,040
Speaker 0: he was actually an okay guy.

152
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,742
Speaker 0: It's just.

153
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,050
Speaker 0: he was also the best racer in the galaxy.

154
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,664
Speaker 1: There's this great scene where someone's giving him shit and he's like like he stands.

155
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,650
Speaker 1: some guy stands in his way in a restaurant.

156
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,336
Speaker 1: I mean shit looks.

157
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:23,841
Speaker 1: him is like you'd better move or I'll be forced to walk around you.

158
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:25,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like it's bad.

159
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,290
Speaker 0: What's even better?

160
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,920
Speaker 0: Is it the pretty visual like what machine had looks like?

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,044
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

162
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:31,590
Speaker 0: He looks like a giant guy.

163
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,911
Speaker 0: He's.

164
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:32,715
Speaker 0: he's gigantic.

165
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:35,910
Speaker 0: He's gonna be the bad guy, but actually he's not a bad guy.

166
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,596
Speaker 0: There's a scene like he's petting a dog.

167
00:10:37,657 --> 00:10:38,821
Speaker 1: He has a really cute dog.

168
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:39,604
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

169
00:10:39,745 --> 00:10:41,190
Speaker 1: it's like he also has a theme song.

170
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:42,148
Speaker 1: That's just machine.

171
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:47,606
Speaker 0: That just makes me really like him because it's like if he was the evil team I would have been like Oh evil team boo.

172
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:54,470
Speaker 1: This is where this movie I think extends beyond what I would call a typical movie or an anime or whatever.

173
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,669
Speaker 0: That's what separates it from Hanna-Barbera's wacky races.

174
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:00,890
Speaker 1: It's that it threw me for a loop a bunch of times that I saw something happen.

175
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:10,918
Speaker 1: I said and Scott and I were like, oh duh now X is going to happen as a result of this and about half the time Something so unexpected happened.

176
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,090
Speaker 0: Well, it was weird like cuz I could predict five seconds in the future.

177
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,095
Speaker 0: Right, like they were in the early in the movie I was like, oh that's that.

178
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:24,750
Speaker 0: and then literally as soon as I finished talking they said what I said Yeah, and I was like, oh shit, but then you know, I couldn't predict the long run.

179
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,897
Speaker 0: I was like, well, here's the possibilities for the long run.

180
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:30,910
Speaker 0: They win they lose they crash, you know, it's like every possibility.

181
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:33,025
Speaker 0: So I had no idea where it's going.

182
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:33,550
Speaker 0: long term.

183
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:38,278
Speaker 0: I could only predict like five seconds out which is pretty good But it threw me for a loop so many times.

184
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:54,021
Speaker 1: and the things that threw me for a loop because it had a really cut Together style like in one hand is following the kind of main character plot and then on another hand like a second angle is following the government of robo world Incompetently trying to stop this race with its entire planetary military might.

185
00:11:54,623 --> 00:12:02,485
Speaker 1: and then the third angle is just like Interviews and news clips and character profiles and just kind of showing you.

186
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,998
Speaker 0: it's showing you like two different worlds You're learning about.

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,370
Speaker 0: it's like almost three different worlds.

188
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:14,010
Speaker 0: It's showing you an exploration of the world of this galaxy this this civilization Also the world of robo world.

189
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,650
Speaker 0: What's it like and what the community of racing fans and racing participants of?

190
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,756
Speaker 0: Red line and yellow line are like.

191
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:25,890
Speaker 0: so it's like, you know, it really fills in every possible gap in the movie.

192
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,050
Speaker 0: But in the end all of this plot really doesn't matter which is great.

193
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:35,990
Speaker 0: All this plot is is an excuse to have insanely awesomely animated action scenes.

194
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:39,359
Speaker 1: The crazy I think because you had a carry of defense titan

195
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:53,075
Speaker 0: and I think the robo world trying to destroy the race is the ultimate excuse because what you can do is you can alternate between scenes of racing action and scenes of exploding military fighting action and Both at the same time.

196
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:57,030
Speaker 0: so it's like climax of the movie is this gigantic running battle race?

197
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,452
Speaker 0: Yes, like.

198
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:58,820
Speaker 0: there is no sure it's like.

199
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,907
Speaker 0: if you could go to normal like a mecha show it's all fighting or like a racing show will be all racing, you know.

200
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:12,304
Speaker 0: and But by combining the two You're basically like like doubling down on the insane things that can happen.

201
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:19,765
Speaker 0: and then they push it all the way to the limit Literally with what's the star speckled whatever the streamlight streamlight?

202
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:21,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, they put it to the limit with the stream.

203
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,059
Speaker 1: But there's so many just great iconic scenes like the.

204
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:38,390
Speaker 1: the robo world police keep like busting in unlike people because a bunch of people in robo world want to bet on the race because they think it's awesome and the Please bust in and the police basically just fucking murder everybody, you know, they yeah the police robots.

205
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:44,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sort of like bots like this little cute police bots like please disperse and then it starts firing missiles.

206
00:13:44,568 --> 00:14:02,228
Speaker 1: It's great And like the race the yellow line race You I love the culture of racing because if you ever see a real rally like a real US or world like there are any US rallies Anyway an earth rally in the real world.

207
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:10,805
Speaker 1: today 2011 people will stand as Close to the most dangerous corners as they can as packed in as tightly as they can.

208
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:15,190
Speaker 0: when and when the car is on its Way, they'll run out into the road and watch the car come at them.

209
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,370
Speaker 0: Then when the car is about to hit them They'll run out of the way and go back to watch the car go around the corner.

210
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,969
Speaker 0: Then they'll run out onto the track and watch and run and follow the car so they can see it.

211
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,296
Speaker 0: leave To see the car as much as possible.

212
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:34,023
Speaker 1: the culture of racing in red line is the same way except that thousands die at every Corner every time anyone comes by.

213
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:41,185
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's like because it's animated they're like and we can just do all sorts of ridiculous shit.

214
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:45,383
Speaker 0: people died all over the place You know cars exploding whatever the fuck.

215
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:46,750
Speaker 0: they didn't give a shit, right?

216
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,201
Speaker 0: so the the plus the physics be damned.

217
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:58,774
Speaker 1: aside from Robo world being Amazingly incompetent as a love story and surprisingly evil is that we've got the main guy JP who has an Intergalactic pompadour.

218
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:01,689
Speaker 1: it is it is a pompadour to be to be.

219
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,436
Speaker 0: It is not.

220
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,890
Speaker 0: it is not as feared as the one in kamikaze girls.

221
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:12,510
Speaker 1: So the thing is and I think this is actually my favorite thing in the movie because it only comes up twice.

222
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:15,727
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm JP isn't is driven by two things in his life.

223
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,373
Speaker 1: one He met a girl when he was young and into cars It was totally hot.

224
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:21,236
Speaker 1: who's totally hot?

225
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,006
Speaker 1: and he just really likes her and he really likes racing.

226
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:30,103
Speaker 1: Yeah, too He saw who I can only guess is the god of pimps.

227
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,470
Speaker 0: Oh, right the god of it.

228
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,916
Speaker 1: There's the scene in the beginning.

229
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:37,010
Speaker 0: It's the fact that you forget about it because it's like it's twice.

230
00:15:37,351 --> 00:15:40,861
Speaker 0: Basically, the god of pimps is like in one in one.

231
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,187
Speaker 0: It's you know, they get one piece this red-haired shanks.

232
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:44,090
Speaker 0: That's right.

233
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,704
Speaker 0: It's like the guy that luffy is always thinking about like what would red-haired shanks do right.

234
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:54,269
Speaker 1: the god of pimps is He's the god of pimps, but so in the beginning the movie get this flash back.

235
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:54,994
Speaker 0: You know what?

236
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:59,928
Speaker 0: I've upgraded him above machine head best character in the movie machine heads number two.

237
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,560
Speaker 1: But you basically see this guy who is Akio times 10.

238
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,446
Speaker 1: Akio would blow his load even looking at this.

239
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,434
Speaker 0: definitely I guarantee a hundred Percent.

240
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,694
Speaker 0: I'll bet money that they were inspired Slightly by Akio.

241
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:15,647
Speaker 0: when making the god of there is he does the same car flip into the convertible.

242
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,610
Speaker 0: that there is no way.

243
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:17,550
Speaker 1: This is not the case.

244
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:24,210
Speaker 1: but Black dynamite could learn a lot from the kid the god of pimps and for black dynamite to be able to learn for something from somebody.

245
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:34,573
Speaker 1: As JP a young JP looks on this guy flips over into his amazing car and kisses two women Simultaneously.

246
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,939
Speaker 1: and you might think what do you mean?

247
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,124
Speaker 1: How literally you'll see.

248
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:43,450
Speaker 1: he kisses two women Simultaneously And drives off into the sunset.

249
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:49,390
Speaker 1: You see the kid the god of pimps one more time in the movie and I will not spoil it.

250
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,668
Speaker 1: What happens in that scene is?

251
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,272
Speaker 1: Great.

252
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:58,954
Speaker 0: It is the greatest part of this movie is definitely the number one Part of the entire.

253
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:05,950
Speaker 0: you will know it when it happens because it is the number two part of the movie is When the dude rescues the dude is gonna get killed.

254
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,884
Speaker 1: Oh my god, cuz that comes out of nowhere is a big O scenario.

255
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:09,964
Speaker 0: Yep.

256
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,770
Speaker 1: It's like why don't they Joe?

257
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,679
Speaker 1: They just did Oh times 10.

258
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,810
Speaker 1: Oh and then one other twist happen when he hits the button thing.

259
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:19,093
Speaker 0: That's great.

260
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:19,515
Speaker 0: Yeah.

261
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:19,896
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:27,130
Speaker 0: I mean this movie, you know, I While there's it's basically just so many awesome parts, right?

263
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,110
Speaker 0: It's just awesome part after awesome part after awesome part with awesome animation.

264
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:34,030
Speaker 0: But I I don't really remember any music from it.

265
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,619
Speaker 1: Do you up the closing the credits theme?

266
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,763
Speaker 1: because all right, that's really like the song from the credits And it's okay song that song see.

267
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:44,387
Speaker 1: when I first heard about red line I didn't hear anything about it.

268
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:51,213
Speaker 1: Someone sent me a link and it was a trailer for a red line and I had that song and it had that song and that Trailer amazed me.

269
00:17:51,394 --> 00:18:03,230
Speaker 1: Yep, but I was trying to keep my expectations low, even though the trailer filled me with a Surprising desire like we're talking like point four or five ponies worth of anticipation.

270
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:07,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the fact that the movie lived up to that feeling really surprised me.

271
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:12,443
Speaker 0: But while it is just this crazy awesome thing, but what are you gonna say?

272
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:15,597
Speaker 0: Well, it's it's not like a life-changing movie.

273
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:19,162
Speaker 1: there's no depth or No, there is depth, but it's not.

274
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:23,930
Speaker 1: it's not deep To a degree that it's no Shakespeare the story.

275
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:29,570
Speaker 1: It's not even a shake guy likes girl and also wants to be like the god of pimps.

276
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:33,101
Speaker 0: So he pursues that and he gets into racing and then racing.

277
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,406
Speaker 1: He's actually a really nice guy.

278
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:39,797
Speaker 1: Like I like him and also Robo world The government of Robo world king offense.

279
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:44,368
Speaker 1: the evil of the government of Robo world is eclipsed only by its incompetence.

280
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:54,229
Speaker 0: That's right And that's pretty much all there is to it I think by the end of the movie the entire military of Robo world as a planetary system is gone Destroyed by the race.

281
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,081
Speaker 0: But basically this is I would recommend this right.

282
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:04,840
Speaker 0: this is basically in the same category as like You know the Lupin movies that aren't the castle of Cagliostre, right?

283
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,406
Speaker 0: You bust like a mom.

284
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:07,630
Speaker 0: Oh, well, not like mama.

285
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,636
Speaker 0: Oh mama's like fume of conspiracy.

286
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:10,579
Speaker 1: Columbus egg.

287
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,484
