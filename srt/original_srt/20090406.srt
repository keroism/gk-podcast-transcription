1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,187
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday April 6th.

2
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:11,868
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,115
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:15,820
Speaker 1: We have a bunch of different topics in tech.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:32,459
Speaker 1: So this morning I went to a place.

7
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:34,889
Speaker 1: I very rarely enter these days.

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,785
Speaker 1: I uh, I went into the Dunkin Donuts outside of my work.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,253
Speaker 0: Oh That one the place that's combined that right next to the TGI Fridays Yeah, the one that said.

10
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:50,411
Speaker 0: so that's like the tiniest and worst Dunkin Donuts the one that is also a KFC Space.

11
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,190
Speaker 1: I went in because you know, there's a big roll out of work.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,910
Speaker 1: So a bunch of people were showing up early from the sales team and the customer support team and I'm the morning guy anyway.

13
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,960
Speaker 1: So I wasn't actually gonna show up early.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,166
Speaker 1: I told all them.

15
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:05,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be here early I'll help you out, but I'm always there that early they could they don't know.

16
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,769
Speaker 1: So I even said you know what and I'll bring in some doughnuts.

17
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:13,646
Speaker 1: So I went in and usually I stop it like Starbucks, but instead well Starbucks can't give you done.

18
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:23,840
Speaker 1: It's in quantity like So normally I go to Starbucks and get coffee But instead I went to Dunkin Donuts just to get like a bunch of Timbits, you know There's gonna be like a million people in that Dunkin Donuts.

19
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,367
Speaker 1: It's it's 7 in the morning.

20
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:27,074
Speaker 1: Well like 645 There's no one there.

21
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:27,355
Speaker 1: There was.

22
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,487
Speaker 1: there were like two people in front of me in line and one guy walked in after.

23
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:39,990
Speaker 1: so Normally when I stand in line at the Starbucks I mean What's the stereotype of a Starbucks coffee buyer versus like a Dunkin Donuts or McDonald's coffee buyer?

24
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:49,130
Speaker 1: The Starbucks guys the one who walks in they're like, yeah I want a double soy light latte with that extra this and not enough this and all this sort.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,803
Speaker 1: They have these really weird donuts.

26
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:51,710
Speaker 0: you get coffee.

27
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,457
Speaker 1: It's actually the exact opposite.

28
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,123
Speaker 1: every time I go to Starbucks.

29
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,488
Speaker 1: It's just one after another.

30
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:57,990
Speaker 1: people walk up.

31
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,859
Speaker 1: They're like tall black coffee or latte.

32
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,166
Speaker 1: like they order very simple quick specific things.

33
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,310
Speaker 1: They're prepared immediately.

34
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,659
Speaker 1: They're not fussy if they get the wrong thing.

35
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,969
Speaker 1: They're usually like whatever and they just kind of deal with it.

36
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:17,110
Speaker 1: Meanwhile at the Dunkin Donuts press a where it's like an order of magnitude cheaper like the coffee cost nothing.

37
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:26,850
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, every single person in that line was giving these outrageous orders like hey Could you only fill the cup three quarters the way full and then fill the rest with like half-and-half?

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,081
Speaker 1: But then at the top put a little bit of vanilla from that thing.

39
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,971
Speaker 1: you got over there and then stir it with one ice Cube.

40
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:34,650
Speaker 0: maybe they were like Starbucks II people but they were at the Dunkin Donuts.

41
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,210
Speaker 1: No, no because the the guy says, you know the usual.

42
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:43,730
Speaker 1: And the next guy left and the clerks talked to him.

43
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,779
Speaker 1: They go to that Dunkin Donuts every day.

44
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:54,849
Speaker 1: And as I stood there waiting for my donuts apparently Shoveling donuts from the donut dispenser into my bin took longer than getting like 10 people coffee.

45
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:59,603
Speaker 1: Every single person in this Dunkin Donuts ordered like this like everyone had this.

46
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:02,973
Speaker 1: I would use the word outrageous order Like the.

47
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:10,178
Speaker 1: the level of fussiness and the level of expectation for their 98 cent coffee There should really just be like.

48
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,821
Speaker 0: you should go in the restaurant and be like, you know We don't do anything.

49
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:14,730
Speaker 0: that isn't on the menu.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,923
Speaker 0: So if you want coffee say coffee you have no, you know, you mean like.

51
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:21,359
Speaker 0: you can tell me, you know Dark or not so dark.

52
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:26,929
Speaker 0: You can tell me yes milk or no milk You can tell me right but you can't tell me how much you can't tell me.

53
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,450
Speaker 0: You know if you want it you do it yourself, you know, fuck we don't do that.

54
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:41,385
Speaker 1: What amazed me was that the stereotype was kind of reversed that the P the people getting the crappy coffee were the most Demanding and the people getting the more expensive coffee were generally less caring.

55
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:42,770
Speaker 0: It's all anecdotal anyway.

56
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,370
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is it is something that could be studied.

57
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:54,307
Speaker 1: It's a weird situation because it is the Dunkin Donuts on 42nd Street But at the same time there are eight Starbucks within a two-minute walk of that place.

58
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:59,310
Speaker 0: Yeah The thing is, you know, they could be people trying to save money but are also fussy.

59
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:04,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but I I have this general feeling I'm going solely on nothing here.

60
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,230
Speaker 1: I'm pulling this out of nowhere.

61
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:18,305
Speaker 1: I feel like if you did study this the less on average the less people pay For things the more not necessarily expectations, but the more demands they may make.

62
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:19,750
Speaker 1: and I'll bet it's a cultural thing.

63
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:20,512
Speaker 0: I don't know.

64
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:21,454
Speaker 0: You got a.

65
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,186
Speaker 1: I'm basing this entirely on my experiences at this Dunkin Donuts.

66
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, this one is one morning.

67
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,938
Speaker 0: Why don't you go to Dunkin Donuts next to us?

68
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,030
Speaker 0: That's actually nice for a Dunkin Donuts.

69
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,585
Speaker 1: Actually, the same thing happens at that Dunkin Donuts if you ever go into it.

70
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:34,650
Speaker 0: I never went into it.

71
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,453
Speaker 0: Well often that much.

72
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:39,719
Speaker 1: I'll often stop there when I go for a run and grab like a doughnut just to get some sugar before I go.

73
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,795
Speaker 1: hmm Anyway, that was my morning.

74
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:44,919
Speaker 1: That's that's what I got.

75
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,042
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so exciting.

76
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:46,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's thrilling.

77
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:52,625
Speaker 0: Oh Hi, do you have any I guess technology news of some sort?

78
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:53,930
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta go into news a bit.

79
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,666
Speaker 1: Well, I've realized more and more that in terms of commuting New Yorkers really have it better than everyone else.

80
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:05,970
Speaker 1: our our commuter Infrastructure is amazing compared to pretty much everywhere else in America, America.

81
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,319
Speaker 1: That's an important qualification.

82
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,245
Speaker 1: forget the rest of the world.

83
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:12,884
Speaker 1: We got nothing on that Of course, uh, I think we beat those Indian trains.

84
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:17,827
Speaker 1: No, yeah What was that video where the people are jumping onto the moving train just to get a seat?

85
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,790
Speaker 1: Yep But I didn't realize, you know, I've never been to Boston.

86
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:26,710
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go to Boston for the first time for anime Boston and then again for PAX East.

87
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,270
Speaker 0: But I've been to Boston so many times just not in a while.

88
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,419
Speaker 1: But yeah, well, I mean what I grew up in the Midwest.

89
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:40,010
Speaker 1: my vacations were like down to Florida or to see your point of Florida also or to Chicago, but I think we didn't go out east to those eastern places the good places.

90
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,522
Speaker 1: Is really that good in Boston.

91
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:43,530
Speaker 0: Boston's pretty nice.

92
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,754
Speaker 0: It's also.

93
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:48,949
Speaker 0: it's also real colonial except like you think it's colonial like around here.

94
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,998
Speaker 0: You go to Boston.

95
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, it's not so nice in Boston the MTBA.

96
00:05:54,112 --> 00:06:09,250
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read an excerpt from the beginning of this article because it's kind of interesting and I Think this illustrates more than anything Why commuter rail or generally a lot of publicly funded things have issues quote?

97
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:11,255
Speaker 1: It's been documented before.

98
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:17,175
Speaker 1: the commuter rail service in Massachusetts is among the tardiest in the country with trains showing up late more than 20% of the time.

99
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,465
Speaker 1: hmm, but the official NT MTBA numbers tell only part of the sad commuting story.

100
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:32,005
Speaker 1: according to a globe analysis the rush-hour trains the ones most people take are actually late 6% more often.

101
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:37,902
Speaker 0: that are indicated by the official statistics Because the other the non rush-hour trains show up on time enough.

102
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,190
Speaker 0: well, so they only look at the total numbers.

103
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,618
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

104
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,790
Speaker 0: They should do it by person.

105
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,315
Speaker 0: People get on a late train.

106
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,498
Speaker 0: That's how you figure it out,

107
00:06:47,799 --> 00:07:01,947
Speaker 1: but it turns out that they very pointedly and specifically aggregate the numbers from the entire day for their statistics and in fact They make a point of not tracking commuter versus non commuter so that no one can use those statistics to do anything.

108
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:14,337
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm They obfuscate the data and I think what bothers me the most if there's a quote an official quote from the one of the guys like the head of all this and the MTBA and he says From a service perspective.

109
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:22,797
Speaker 1: I don't want to be saying that one train is more important than another Which either Belies his intelligence or

110
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:23,861
Speaker 0: I think that yeah

111
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:33,875
Speaker 1: or or more more likely It proves that he realizes that numbers would make him and his department look bad and thus covers them up The most expedient way possible.

112
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:37,610
Speaker 0: Well, what they should do is really I mean Metro North does the same thing, right?

113
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,730
Speaker 0: They just give you the total lateness numbers They don't give you the you know times really do the same time.

114
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,816
Speaker 1: But one thing I can point.

115
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,211
Speaker 0: I think they might actually split peak and off peak I don't.

116
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:51,894
Speaker 1: one thing I can point out about Metro North is that in all my years of commuting on it It's mostly on time.

117
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,524
Speaker 1: The rush hour trains are pretty much never late.

118
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:57,064
Speaker 1: And if anything is late, it's the off-peak trains No one cares about.

119
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:01,964
Speaker 0: yeah What they should do is they shouldn't say how many trains are late.

120
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:07,397
Speaker 0: they should say how many passengers Arrived at their destination late.

121
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:12,050
Speaker 0: Well, that's what they should calculate is what percentage of passengers or when you know what they could do.

122
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,443
Speaker 0: Here's the most accurate number.

123
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:16,729
Speaker 0: you could use Total passenger late minutes.

124
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:24,476
Speaker 0: So if I miss if I'm late for my stop for five minutes and there are a hundred people on that train that adds 500 late minutes.

125
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,184
Speaker 0: you see and that's how they should figure it out.

126
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:27,350
Speaker 0: Just total late minutes.

127
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,149
Speaker 1: But no, here's the more important point.

128
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,133
Speaker 1: Think about this.

129
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:35,485
Speaker 1: How come the trains that are used the most are so much more late.

130
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:41,230
Speaker 1: There's clearly yeah, either These schedules are bad and because the train has to stop at the station longer.

131
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,736
Speaker 1: No, that's not the problem.

132
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,201
Speaker 1: That's that doesn't even factor into this.

133
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:50,456
Speaker 1: if the rush hour trains are consistently that late What jackass is making?

134
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,107
Speaker 1: the schedules say that they'll make it at these times that they clearly can't make?

135
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,150
Speaker 0: that's also true.

136
00:08:55,471 --> 00:09:03,453
Speaker 1: That is the fundamental problem that they're holding themselves to a standard that they clearly can't make and then they're making that standard by lying Mm-hmm.

137
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,364
Speaker 1: Now the other thing is they really it's.

138
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:12,048
Speaker 1: it seems like they haven't actually investigated what the specific causes are because it it does break down pretty simply either.

139
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:15,270
Speaker 1: it's People getting out and getting off because you see this Metro North trains.

140
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,049
Speaker 1: it takes like five sometimes six or seven minutes for the beacon train to fill out just because Everyone's stupid and they all get into the front car.

141
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, it takes them all this time.

142
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,589
Speaker 0: just get off the train you're just sitting there and well people get off.

143
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:31,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also maybe there's something to do with you know cascade effects.

144
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:36,310
Speaker 1: one train is late And then all the other trains don't have any leeway that there could be a million things.

145
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:43,470
Speaker 1: But it seems like very trivially if they just track to this data instead of trying to lie about it or cover it up.

146
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,128
Speaker 0: But that require doing actual work.

147
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:55,290
Speaker 1: but they're already tracking the trains but then they aggregate the data and get rid of the Specific data, all they would have to do is add that data is like, you know, not even like correctly.

148
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:57,068
Speaker 1: What's even worse?

149
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:07,344
Speaker 1: apparently their policy the way it works internally is that they find the train operator if his train is late and it wasn't due to something he had control or it was due to something he had control over.

150
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:11,482
Speaker 1: but When would a train operator ever make a train late?

151
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,410
Speaker 1: on purpose or within their control?

152
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:21,919
Speaker 0: I guess you could mess up right like you could you know mess up going through the signals or you know Something sudden along those lines, you know, you could.

153
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,565
Speaker 0: you know, not you could like, you know not mess up something I don't know.

154
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:25,891
Speaker 0: It

155
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:40,649
Speaker 1: seems like that is not the best way to go about fixing this Because one that only encourages people to lie or cover up when they've made a mistake or say if they're late due to an error Maybe they'll speed to catch up and turn off the safeties because they don't want to get.

156
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:40,990
Speaker 1: fine.

157
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,078
Speaker 0: It's also that's a tear.

158
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,769
Speaker 1: I mean there was even a TED talk about that.

159
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:48,246
Speaker 1: That's the exact wrong way to incentivize people to do their job better.

160
00:10:48,407 --> 00:11:01,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right but it's such a simple solution, but I don't think there's any way to force a Proper because anyone who's smart enough to manage the trains right is this remember?

161
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:02,630
Speaker 0: This is like a government job.

162
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,130
Speaker 0: This is like a job that's all union e and seniority, right and not meritocracy.

163
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:17,303
Speaker 0: Someone who's smart enough to manage the trains is never gonna have that job and that job will never pay enough or be pleasant enough For someone who is that smart to ever want that job.

164
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:18,649
Speaker 0: So there you go.

165
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:19,895
Speaker 1: The best part is.

166
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,827
Speaker 1: apparently they just had a big rate hike and a lot of that money went into Putting in new turnstiles and stuff that don't work as opposed to fixing the trains.

167
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:27,490
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

168
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least the MTA.

169
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,770
Speaker 1: every time they get a bunch of money suddenly everything gets a lot nicer.

170
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:36,850
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, there's a problem with doing a meritocracy as your government.

171
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:49,590
Speaker 0: We haven't figured that one out yet, but there is no problem doing a meritocracy And a place of employment because we have very real rubrics and metrics for measuring someone's job performance and a lot of these.

172
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:56,090
Speaker 1: Interestingly enough because I'm Randomly, I've been reading a lot about the napoleonic error again.

173
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,847
Speaker 1: I got all these books from when I was gonna run this burning wheel game that I never got around to.

174
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,093
Speaker 1: it's so far Down in the hopper.

175
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:02,419
Speaker 0: She's talking so much.

176
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:03,504
Speaker 1: It's in the hopper.

177
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,934
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Yeah, it's a deep hopper.

178
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:41,550
Speaker 1: My hopper is deeper than you can possibly imagine, but I was reading this stuff again and I Lot of historians have made the very interesting point that two Surprising meritocracies that did exist and did work functionally and properly to a large degree where the British Navy during that whole era and the military of France during the early part of the napoleonic era Mm-hmm, and there was a. there's a whole chapter in one of these books on why these like why these were meritocracies And why they worked and then at the same time why eventually they broke down and we're no longer meritocracies.

179
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,569
Speaker 1: But I feel like we can apply a lot of those policies to things we have now.

180
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:48,706
Speaker 0: Well, we got to watch out for that why they broke down part.

181
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:49,148
Speaker 1: Yes.

182
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,189
Speaker 1: Yes Yes, we also have to watch out for captain laudanum who invariably makes his way in.

183
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a problem.

184
00:12:55,895 --> 00:13:04,718
Speaker 0: Well, I think most remember those are both militaries which has sort of like the the sort of side Factor of people without merit.

185
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:05,982
Speaker 0: just there's lots of death.

186
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:08,370
Speaker 0: So you just lose lots of people that way.

187
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:17,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, well like if you're a bad ship captain either you're gonna get course mark cart marshal and hung or hanged I guess is the technical term or your ship's gonna get stumped.

188
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:21,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, it says, you know, but that doesn't really happen so much.

189
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:30,870
Speaker 0: I mean unless you're a really really really really bad train operator Your trains not gonna crash like the guy who crashed the train because he was busy playing with teenagers and text messaging everyone.

190
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's super rare.

191
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:38,425
Speaker 1: So here's where this gets really interesting our Chan Fung and I think that's one of the coolest names.

192
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:40,071
Speaker 1: I've ever seen a Quote.

193
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:54,158
Speaker 1: political scientist who is part of Harvard's transparency policy project Argues that the T and other public organizations should make all of their data available to the public over the internet in raw form Of course, so customers can quote him.

194
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:55,663
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I'm quoting again.

195
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:56,446
Speaker 1: There's a meta quote here.

196
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:57,449
Speaker 1: mash it up.

197
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:09,341
Speaker 1: He thinks that in general if you just take like if instead of aggregating the data and publishing this specific data that you know Like these are our times or whatever What if they just made an API and just put out

198
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:12,170
Speaker 0: all they're not smart enough to fix a train schedule.

199
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,562
Speaker 0: You think they're smart enough to make like a cool web API.

200
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:16,184
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

201
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,268
Speaker 1: even know what that is.

202
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:18,820
Speaker 1: Here's the thing I'm pretty sure.

203
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:28,610
Speaker 1: if they said sure That Harvard could put together a team of IT people and CS people to make it So in like a couple weeks, yeah, they could do it.

204
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,330
Speaker 0: But the thing is they'd need to basically get full access.

205
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,260
Speaker 0: Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to be.

206
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:40,233
Speaker 0: it'd be that situation where you're sitting there Just waiting for the stupid person to give you what you're asking for and then they give it to you and it's not what you Asked for.

207
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:43,470
Speaker 0: yeah, but and you're sitting there waiting for this email and you're not doing anything.

208
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:51,890
Speaker 1: I think it could be done pretty readily if only Politicians could force the MTBA to open up their data.

209
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:56,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would take a law and be and they had a bunch of grad students.

210
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,419
Speaker 0: It would take a lie.

211
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,828
Speaker 0: There's so much stupidity in the way.

212
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:04,347
Speaker 1: All it would take is one law and like ten grad student.

213
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,110
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's a lot.

214
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,510
Speaker 0: You know a law is a lot to ask.

215
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,770
Speaker 0: I know I know I know and then you actually think that people are gonna execute the law like properly.

216
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:25,350
Speaker 1: But I do like the idea, you know politics aside that any public organization unless the data they have is Politically like is sensitive in a way that could cause direct harm to people should just be completely open to.

217
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:34,930
Speaker 1: Even if they can't make a web API I Should be able to mail them and pay some nominal pittance and just get it all in text format on like a CD.

218
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:38,144
Speaker 0: That's what the FOI is supposed to be for except half the time.

219
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:38,826
Speaker 1: It's all secret.

220
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,898
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah It's you know, and they're trying to work on it.

221
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,490
Speaker 0: I think but that it's really the results so far have been unimpressive.

222
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:50,407
Speaker 1: Of course the thing is scarily, you know, who's some of the biggest pushers of the FOI?

223
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:57,048
Speaker 1: a stuff are UFO people of course and then they always claim it's not working because the government's like fine.

224
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:57,650
Speaker 1: Here's the data.

225
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,508
Speaker 0: We didn't find any stupid UFO like, you know, FYA when I was in high school or whatever to get whatever.

226
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,030
Speaker 0: they sent me.

227
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:10,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I read it all and it was basically a whole bunch of nothing and there was some stuff blacked out But it was barely anything.

228
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,674
Speaker 0: and like, okay There was some stuff blacked out.

229
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:26,578
Speaker 0: right if I if I anything that could possibly have fit where those words were Would not have met their aliens actually remember that there was nothing you could have written That would have made sense in those black spaces.

230
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,750
Speaker 0: that would have you know blown the lid off the roof.

231
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,770
Speaker 0: It was probably most of the stuff was probably like people's names.

232
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,675
Speaker 1: Remember way back.

233
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:47,427
Speaker 1: not not the thing where you could just turn off the redactions in Adobe documents But that guy who made the statistical analysis program where you could figure out with a reasonable degree of certainty What was redacted just by the context of the sentences?

234
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,890
Speaker 0: Yep And also, you know the stuff where it was printed but then gone over with a marker.

235
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:55,059
Speaker 0: They would use a scanner to see it again.

236
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty trivial.

237
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:57,349
Speaker 1: Actually we could do that at home.

238
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:02,230
Speaker 0: Yep, you can actually do it just like a shiny light and your eyeballs sometimes anyway.

239
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:10,660
Speaker 1: I think I think this is an interesting article because it raises a lot of issues that are interesting And it proposes all the solutions we need.

240
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:19,589
Speaker 1: but it's one of those things where we know the problem We know the solution we have the means to put forth the solution, but it will never happen.

241
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:26,470
Speaker 1: And I I don't know what to do about the same problem as everything else.

242
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,022
Speaker 1: But but again, I don't know what to do about it.

243
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:32,133
Speaker 0: You got to kill all the stupid people You could do.

244
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,658
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a solution either.

245
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:39,140
Speaker 0: Well, you know get rid not killed literally, you know, just get you know It's it's the battle against stupidity.

246
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,788
Speaker 0: It is never-ending and give up.

247
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:47,689
Speaker 0: So this is a this is sort of a sad story, but it sort of got my mind on a tangent, right?

248
00:17:48,510 --> 00:18:00,050
Speaker 0: You know when you install adblock plus it asks you to choose to subscribe to a filter Yeah, and there's different filters for different countries, you know and such and you always pick the the easy list, right?

249
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,700
Speaker 0: Cuz it's the u.s.

250
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,190
Speaker 0: One right.

251
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,595
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, yeah, I do.

252
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:11,157
Speaker 0: I have to keep backing you yeah, so the the guy who maintained the easy list He died.

253
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:17,547
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, well, so, you know, that's that's sad that this guy died.

254
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,526
Speaker 0: and You know some people were saying oh no is the easy list still gonna be around.

255
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:22,848
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

256
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:23,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

257
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,321
Speaker 0: Well, yeah It's gonna be fine.

258
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:29,370
Speaker 0: Don't don't worry You know worry more about the guy dying than worrying about the ad block continuing to work, right?

259
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:30,654
Speaker 1: That's all people worry about.

260
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:31,538
Speaker 1: right riser.

261
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:33,284
Speaker 1: What did anyone talk about on slashdot?

262
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:35,150
Speaker 1: So what's happening to the file system, right?

263
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:35,551
Speaker 0: All right.

264
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:44,209
Speaker 0: So the thing is that that I thought was interesting as I started thinking Hey, you know even adblock plus the greatest ad block system in the world, right?

265
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,130
Speaker 0: Basically has a human maintainer.

266
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,409
Speaker 0: There's a guy who goes out there and finds ads and then comes up with the regular expressions that block them.

267
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,589
Speaker 0: It's it's not automatic, you know.

268
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:59,143
Speaker 0: Look like blocking ads like a DVR here.

269
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:02,841
Speaker 0: I mean sure sometimes It can sort of like oh, aha.

270
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,150
Speaker 0: There was a fade-out and a fade-in.

271
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,829
Speaker 0: I'll skip that but sometimes there's a show with a fade-out or in a faded or a movie or something in it.

272
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:17,530
Speaker 0: You know, it's an or it's not precise and you need a person to actually fast forward and you know Or cut the ad out in some video editor to put it on bit toward her.

273
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,362
Speaker 1: Well South Park did it pretty well where they did by accident.

274
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, we forgot to put the ads into that episode.

275
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty good.

276
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:30,270
Speaker 1: so literally we're watching South Park commercial break comes and there's just a minute and 30 seconds of a blank screen.

277
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:32,842
Speaker 1: Yep, it was actually kind of pleasant.

278
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,370
Speaker 1: It was a nice intermission.

279
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:35,437
Speaker 0: I kind of like that.

280
00:19:35,477 --> 00:19:37,450
Speaker 0: tell you they gotta bring intermission back to the movie theaters.

281
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:44,530
Speaker 0: But anyway, I just you know, it got me started thinking about like how all these adblock systems are still human systems.

282
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,109
Speaker 0: It's and there is no automatic ad blocking really so much.

283
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:48,932
Speaker 0: It's.

284
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:52,985
Speaker 0: it's always people, you know deciding what are ads and what are not ads.

285
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,309
Speaker 0: and this really, you know.

286
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:06,290
Speaker 0: And it's it's sort of a subjective thing there and it's also sort of there's no no There's no way it could possibly be done, you know Like what could you possibly do to have a computer at the same time?

287
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:15,610
Speaker 1: This is almost the same issue as the MBTA thing where by we have we have People's brains who are very smart and able to do crazy things.

288
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:17,969
Speaker 1: Computers are nowhere near and won't be for a long time.

289
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:30,830
Speaker 1: crowdsourcing can solve amazing problems in amazing amounts of time But at the same time very few people who like the people who need this the most don't leverage it.

290
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:39,241
Speaker 1: so we only get it for things like ad blocking and things where geeks are the ones who care about the problem and Geeks are the ones who can implement the solution.

291
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:39,763
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

292
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:41,090
Speaker 1: We never get it for anything else.

293
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,913
Speaker 0: That's why we're just.

294
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:55,377
Speaker 0: that's why it's gotten to the point where the geek world is just another world from you know because all the things that geeks care about and geeks have control over are basically in the future and everything else is Really no different than it used to be.

295
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:59,310
Speaker 0: because you know, there hasn't been you know, any sort of geek action there.

296
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:09,069
Speaker 1: I mean look normal people Hulu is like this cool thing that they use on their computer to watch some TV with ads But they still watch cable geeks computer hooked up to the TV and a hacked boxy.

297
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,937
Speaker 1: Yep They don't like they don't even think about it.

298
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,628
Speaker 1: Nope, but yet normal people have no access to that.

299
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:17,036
Speaker 1: Nope So what do we do about this?

300
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:21,450
Speaker 1: Do we just continue to break away further and further from the society around us?

301
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,895
Speaker 0: Oh, what are you gonna go and give up?

302
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,421
Speaker 0: Why are you geekiness and live slowly?

303
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:29,290
Speaker 1: I can be like that Neo primitivist that Emily knew in college.

304
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,621
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna be like that the guy who get.

305
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:36,417
Speaker 1: he got rid of all his furniture in his dorm room Clothes and he kept his Mac book.

306
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:39,905
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz he had to blog about his a neo-primitivist lifestyle.

307
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:40,566
Speaker 0: I know right?

308
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,291
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

309
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:47,190
Speaker 1: Well, I wonder if maybe I feel like some speculation is due as to what?

310
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,495
Speaker 1: Problems this schism is going to cause ten years from now Ten years from now.

311
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:55,003
Speaker 0: I mean the same problems you have now only worse.

312
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,598
Speaker 0: cuz what's gonna happen is, you know You're already seeing it now.

313
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,410
Speaker 0: It's the situation of oh, no, the newspapers are going to add business.

314
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:08,010
Speaker 0: What's the normal person gonna do who doesn't know how to use a computer and it's like, you know, you had your transition period.

315
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,258
Speaker 0: It's been over a decade since the Internet's.

316
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,490
Speaker 0: you've had a long time to get you know to move ahead.

317
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,289
Speaker 0: If you still haven't moved ahead, there's not a newspaper anymore.

318
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,694
Speaker 0: You have no choice.

319
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,924
Speaker 0: if you don't like ebooks, you know or computer.

320
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,890
Speaker 1: I think it's going to be reading on a screen.

321
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:31,870
Speaker 1: I think it's going to be far more sinister than that because as long as there are people who can't use these technologies There will be a market in catering to them.

322
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,025
Speaker 1: But at the same time these are the people who will just buy.

323
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:40,498
Speaker 1: the nature of the media They consume and the way they consume it will have the least control over what they get.

324
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:50,070
Speaker 1: so they'll be more and more Scarily controlled by the very people who use the technology to give them their information in their old methods.

325
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but their numbers will be so small that they won't be able to do anything.

326
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,340
Speaker 0: It'll just be a very, you know, they'll be the crazies.

327
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,926
Speaker 1: Will they really though?

328
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:58,990
Speaker 1: How small will they be?

329
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,330
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know big at first and then decreasing over time at the same time.

330
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:06,790
Speaker 0: I don't know if the person also mostly be old people who go away.

331
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,301
Speaker 0: You know the first ones to go.

332
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:09,630
Speaker 1: for every 4chan kid.

333
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,647
Speaker 1: There are still 10 kids who don't really use the internet and still read newspapers either.

334
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,210
Speaker 1: They don't read.

335
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, but kids don't read.

336
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:16,819
Speaker 0: we don't wear.

337
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,588
Speaker 0: the old people don't worry about they read.

338
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,609
Speaker 1: now I'm not I'm more worried about the kids.

339
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:27,856
Speaker 0: Well that kids not reading is a different problem than old people reading paper But I think it's getting.

340
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:34,110
Speaker 1: it's getting to the point more and more where I have very little ways to Communicate with the people around me like in my neighborhood.

341
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:42,025
Speaker 1: I would have almost no way to communicate with anyone in my neighborhood Like I if I found their first and last name, I'd have to go find a phone book, I guess.

342
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,899
Speaker 0: Yeah He's Google phone book.

343
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that doesn't always work so well.

344
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,630
Speaker 0: Maybe I could just shout into the street going to someone's door and knocking on it.

345
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:51,857
Speaker 0: It's like the olden days.

346
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:52,883
Speaker 0: he could do that nowadays.

347
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,050
Speaker 0: He can't do that so much.

348
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:59,668
Speaker 1: I guess you could but I have not knocked on a stranger's door in almost a decade.

349
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,943
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, you know, nope, nope one not that long ago.

350
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,270
Speaker 1: I knocked on the wrong door.

351
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:26,088
Speaker 0: People will think you're a Jehovah's Witness or something You know, you're only knock at a door if you have actual business, you know I'm a UPS guy or I'm I'm coming to fix your water heater or I'm your friend or you know You know a stranger knocking on the door to talk about something that a is not a business Transaction and B is not a sales pitch from a religious person.

352
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:31,046
Speaker 1: that Knocking on my door is the equivalent of pinging my secure ports.

353
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:31,850
Speaker 1: It's like what are you doing?

354
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,559
Speaker 1: Why are you trying that that ports not for you?

355
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:34,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's so.

356
00:24:34,826 --> 00:24:37,455
Speaker 1: it's like There's an API right?

357
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,660
Speaker 1: There's that mailbox.

358
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:41,150
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe we could you know, I mean there's nothing wrong with it.

359
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,240
Speaker 0: But it just you know, it's not.

360
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,478
Speaker 0: it's not what it used to be This old gray mare.

361
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:52,912
Speaker 1: It's a you know, like remember that Hitchcock We were watching where those two guys just walk into the guy's house and hang out in his living room waiting for him to come Home.

362
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, that used to be totally cool.

363
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:58,469
Speaker 0: I'd like to live in a place where that was totally cool But that's not the way it is.

364
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,630
Speaker 0: But

365
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:17,912
Speaker 1: I think the schism like even at my work like I work in an incredibly high-powered IT and CS environment Like I really honestly think I work in one of the most technologically proficient companies in America like I Don't want to brag but the like people are smart to the point that I often feel very dumb and very inadequate at the place I work.

366
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:20,604
Speaker 1: and for someone with my ego, I think that says something.

367
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:24,222
Speaker 1: and yet at the same time There was a conversation today at one of our big meetings.

368
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:32,470
Speaker 1: I am the only person Possibly in the company who uses Twitter at all and I barely use it because I'm a curmudgeon.

369
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,136
Speaker 1: Think about that.

370
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:39,417
Speaker 0: So you're not working at a very high-powered Technologically advanced place.

371
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:40,742
Speaker 1: I think I am though.

372
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:42,389
Speaker 0: No, but no one uses Twitter.

373
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:48,376
Speaker 0: Compare yourself to the company where everyone uses Twitter already that you go you got but at the same time What are they doing?

374
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:49,850
Speaker 1: What kind of big iron do they have running?

375
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,159
Speaker 0: There are places that you all use Twitter and have big iron.

376
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,685
Speaker 0: dig digs got big iron.

377
00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:56,090
Speaker 1: Do you even know what big iron means?

378
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:06,026
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, I got.

379
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,272
Speaker 1: I got a good thing of the day here.

380
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,744
Speaker 1: I found this out of nowhere Like it was oh shit.

381
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:11,607
Speaker 0: I forgot my thing today.

382
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,109
Speaker 0: What was that?

383
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:24,719
Speaker 1: But I'll talk about mine and maybe you'll remember yours, but Out of the blue we were talking about peeing because I think I had a. I had a particularly long Pee session the other day to the point that it woke Scott up in his room.

384
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,068
Speaker 1: So, you know, he comes to me the next day.

385
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:27,611
Speaker 1: He's like rim.

386
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,119
Speaker 1: That was quite a pee ahead this morning.

387
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:38,560
Speaker 1: You shouldn't pee that loud and then my response as I often do I kind of respond in the real world The way I would respond to someone if I were on FARC.

388
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:42,560
Speaker 1: Is that just went to my computer went on YouTube and search for that scene?

389
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:45,720
Speaker 1: From a league of their own where Tom Hanks just pees forever.

390
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:48,244
Speaker 1: And I found it.

391
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:54,804
Speaker 1: but then there are all these other scenes and I realized that this video was a collection of All the times.

392
00:26:54,884 --> 00:26:59,680
Speaker 1: Tom Hanks has had an extended peeing scene in a movie and you know what?

393
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:04,063
Speaker 1: there are a lot of them like a Surprising number.

394
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:09,580
Speaker 1: Tom Hanks is now typecast as the guy what pees on screen for longer than is comfortable.

395
00:27:09,984 --> 00:27:11,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean a league of their own.

396
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:17,040
Speaker 1: the Green Mile Apollo 13 the castaway movie.

397
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:18,793
Speaker 1: There were like four more.

398
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:19,500
Speaker 1: it was crazy.

399
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,299
Speaker 0: He does a lot of peeing.

400
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,167
Speaker 0: I mean if I me if I'm making a movie which I'm probably never gonna do really but And I need someone to pee.

401
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,333
Speaker 0: I know who to call.

402
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:31,548
Speaker 1: I Think a league of their own has the longest one.

403
00:27:31,688 --> 00:27:36,969
Speaker 0: But yeah, so I forgot my thing of the day But I remembered an alternative thing of the day.

404
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,696
Speaker 0: So I don't have to get up and pause the show.

405
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:47,060
Speaker 0: All right, so You know that there's a webcomic that's pretty old and actually hasn't been updated in a long time called Shabbat six thousand.

406
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:51,065
Speaker 1: Oh, I love Shabbat Shabot dot com.

407
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,248
Speaker 0: six thousand dot com.

408
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,535
Speaker 1: get a link to that flash of the one.

409
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:55,960
Speaker 1: I forget what holiday it is.

410
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:57,314
Speaker 0: Well, he's got a few flashes.

411
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:17,280
Speaker 0: But anyway Basically, it's a funny comic where you have a robot living with a rabbi and the robot learns about Jewishness And he's always being like, you know misbehaving You know, at least Jewish misbehaving, you know, it's like, you know on Yom Kippur, you know to help me get through the fast.

412
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,719
Speaker 0: You know, sometimes I eat a little.

413
00:28:22,431 --> 00:28:35,379
Speaker 0: So That guy apparently a year ago made this video 20 things to do with matzah and that thing sort of became popular on the Internet's this year.

414
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,600
Speaker 0: Took a year, you know that to the next Passover.

415
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,476
Speaker 0: so it's a fun video of this guy and a girl singing a song about 20 things to do with matzah.

416
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:49,650
Speaker 0: and Passover is a Wednesday, so it's relevant.

417
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:59,391
Speaker 0: There's another flash video where It's a. it's a the rabbi the robot and 50 cent are Rapping about the ten players.

418
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:00,838
Speaker 0: That's a good one, too.

419
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:02,504
Speaker 1: All right.

420
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:03,188
Speaker 0: All right.

421
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,976
Speaker 1: So, uh, what were we doing?

422
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:05,600
Speaker 1: this show on?

423
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:06,762
Speaker 0: I don't know.

424
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:10,035
Speaker 0: a whole bunch of stuff got it all written down.

425
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:14,993
Speaker 0: some of it I mean basically what happened was is people started giving us ideas for the show

426
00:29:15,013 --> 00:29:15,073
Speaker 1: and

427
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:24,740
Speaker 0: all of the ideas either a required preparation right and the problem with a preparation show is not that we have to do preparation because we have time to do some preparation.

428
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:39,907
Speaker 0: Reparation is that if we do a show about something we don't know about like and have an actual experience with then our preparation Consists of internet research and the show becomes read Wikipedia Or effectively read Wikipedia.

429
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:42,256
Speaker 0: in which case what's the point of us doing a show right?

430
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,380
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a show?

431
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:52,800
Speaker 0: It's either it's because we have personal experience with something and we can provide Knowledge or insight that is not available on the Internet's already with your Google searches, right?

432
00:29:54,143 --> 00:30:00,797
Speaker 0: So the other problem is sometimes we get a show topic But the show topic is so minimal that it would only be like five minutes of talking.

433
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:04,100
Speaker 0: and that's it You know, oh we talked about it and well, we're done.

434
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,383
Speaker 0: There's nothing else to say about that topic so that we can't really use that for a show because we need like 20 minutes At least of talking.

435
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:17,060
Speaker 0: so we decided hey, what if we combine a bunch of those five-minute shows into a 20-minute show and?

436
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,905
Speaker 0: That might work.

437
00:30:19,306 --> 00:30:20,993
Speaker 0: So it's not a tech news roundup.

438
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,599
Speaker 0: It's like a tech show roundup.

439
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:33,131
Speaker 1: I'll kick it right off with a short one because I think I mentioned this a little bit earlier but we had our live stream and it went really well.

440
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:37,106
Speaker 1: the audio for that will be up this Thursday because we're gonna try to Do a full week of shows this week.

441
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:40,080
Speaker 1: try because you know Scott's going out of town Wednesday stuff.

442
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:43,940
Speaker 1: But I'll probably put about Olivia a bunch of extra stuff up in the feed this week.

443
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,740
Speaker 1: But you know we recorded this and we did it on you stream and things were going fine.

444
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:56,252
Speaker 1: And then a little way through suddenly the shit cockery began Suddenly and like a lot more than I would have expected.

445
00:30:56,272 --> 00:31:06,939
Speaker 0: Well, I think what it really started happening I mean you know there were some people who were sort of you know gig nights fans or a little bit shit cocky You know, but they were you know sort of relevantly shit cocky.

446
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,431
Speaker 1: But then we got featured on the front page.

447
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:19,181
Speaker 0: yes if you get enough people in your channel You'll get to the front page of you stream And then random people who just come to you stream TV will click on you or just get thrown into your channel You know.

448
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:23,679
Speaker 0: so you get those people and those people the shit cockers.

449
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:34,420
Speaker 1: now I have to preface this because I mean we're both technological people Scott and I are both aware fully of the nature of the legion of like the hordes of the Internet.

450
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,459
Speaker 0: The John Gabriel's internet fuckwad theory is not news to us.

451
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have been playing the.

452
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:41,050
Speaker 0: you know the FPS is on the Internet's.

453
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:55,159
Speaker 1: for since you know last century millennium I mean I remember when I would play quake one I would log on to a server and I would be killed by a man named fuck Jesus who is saying your mother Repeatedly in the chat faster than he was shooting me.

454
00:31:55,722 --> 00:32:04,453
Speaker 0: And then would you know after he killed everyone on the map would go to your corpse and crouch many times Man good times and anyway draw a giant penis and that you know.

455
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:05,637
Speaker 0: who knows what else would happen.

456
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,042
Speaker 1: or like you know look I'd

457
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:13,519
Speaker 0: go into an AOL chat room and someone would put in an ASCII art of like naked something and Like fuck fuck motherfuck

458
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:22,653
Speaker 1: I mean or the idea that It's kind of like in a city if there's any space where you can write something on it and no one can stop you The word fuck appears yeah,

459
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:23,379
Speaker 0: and it's anonymous.

460
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:28,231
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean you know we know the theory anonymity plus.

461
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,537
Speaker 0: you know audience equals shit.

462
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:31,380
Speaker 0: cuck right yep.

463
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:33,668
Speaker 1: But our YouTube comments, they're just.

464
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:37,100
Speaker 1: they're a place people can scribble so they scribble horrifying things.

465
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:38,326
Speaker 1: And I knew this.

466
00:32:38,446 --> 00:32:39,894
Speaker 1: I knew this on an intellectual level.

467
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:41,120
Speaker 1: I knew it on a practical level.

468
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:46,778
Speaker 1: I used filters like slashdot and Farken places to where I don't interact with these things.

469
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:47,560
Speaker 1: It's just noise.

470
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:50,540
Speaker 1: It's no more than static to me like I don't even recognize it.

471
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,969
Speaker 0: I mean sometimes you encounter it, but it doesn't.

472
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,194
Speaker 0: you know it doesn't get it through.

473
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,369
Speaker 0: cuz you know we know it's there We knows the problem, and we know how to deal with.

474
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:59,280
Speaker 0: we've dealt with it for a decade.

475
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:04,575
Speaker 1: I mean the internet is the Wild West and I carry a gun and I shoot anyone who looks at me cross-eyed.

476
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:08,753
Speaker 1: yep, but I Guess I didn't really know it.

477
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:13,016
Speaker 1: on a visceral level it's one of those things where you knew it, but at the same time you didn't really.

478
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:19,603
Speaker 0: because Suddenly like like imagine if you just said you lived in a coastal town And you had a bat.

479
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:20,567
Speaker 0: you weren't like New Orleans.

480
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:27,619
Speaker 0: you actually had a real levee that worked and you just after a century You forgot that there were floods and then the levee broke.

481
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:43,717
Speaker 1: the rapidity with which the Not just the rapidity the rapidity and the numerousness of the people who came into this chat room Spouting the most vile garbage imaginable at the drop of a hat to like.

482
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:49,036
Speaker 1: there is no Explanation other than the fact that they went to ustream continuously.

483
00:33:49,076 --> 00:34:02,247
Speaker 1: there was a sea of people Constantly hitting the front page of ustream being immediately directed into whatever was featured there no matter what it was With just everything ready to go Like they were it it.

484
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:06,140
Speaker 1: it gets to the point where it's a matter of premeditation.

485
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:13,460
Speaker 1: It's not like someone just sees a message board and thinks hey, and they go in and type shit fuck fuck fuck fuck shit shit shit shit fuck.

486
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:21,020
Speaker 1: It was that these people are like going to these sites with the specific intent of doing this.

487
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if it's intent right.

488
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:23,980
Speaker 0: I think what it is.

489
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:34,074
Speaker 0: this is a box to type in and they got to type in something right and Basically the third their minds are just so shit cock that that's just.

490
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,739
Speaker 0: that's just what just sort of comes out.

491
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,065
Speaker 0: It's a completely unthinking.

492
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:40,320
Speaker 0: It's completely, but think it's as reflexive as a drunken guy going.

493
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:42,860
Speaker 1: But think of this as a chat room.

494
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,748
Speaker 0: It's like I fuck fuck fuck get within negative.

495
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:53,000
Speaker 1: ten seconds of us being on the front page like 10/15 of these people just start appearing one by one spouting it off.

496
00:34:53,482 --> 00:35:02,634
Speaker 1: That means that for no matter what as long as anything is on the front page of that There's a constant stream of people being directed into it saying these things.

497
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:07,418
Speaker 1: There's a constant stream of people constantly trying to get into places to shit cock.

498
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:10,103
Speaker 1: I I Wonder.

499
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:11,867
Speaker 1: I want to write like a treatise on this.

500
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:16,980
Speaker 1: I want to figure out really why we know what we don't really know why.

501
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:21,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't know why in a psychology sense.

502
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:23,620
Speaker 0: There should be like an actual book about it.

503
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 0: I mean we know we have so far.

504
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,279
Speaker 0: We have a webcomic that explains it really well.

505
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:34,760
Speaker 0: But we don't know the real brain working because I'll and societal workings that result in this and you'll admit to you feel that urge.

506
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,884
Speaker 1: Everyone feels it.

507
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:54,537
Speaker 1: every now and then that little that little tinge is kind of like you're walking down the street and you see like Someone drops their wallet and you think for a second I could just grab it and you don't you don't you like you don't even consider grabbing it, but part of your brain says you could and Sorry already started weighing the odds of getting away with it, but you don't do it.

508
00:35:54,557 --> 00:36:01,872
Speaker 1: You're a good person You don't even think about it, but on the internet with things like this, you know I don't really think about taking the wallet as much as I think about like.

509
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:03,980
Speaker 0: should I ignore it or should I give it back?

510
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:05,625
Speaker 0: I don't even think.

511
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:06,309
Speaker 0: should I take it?

512
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:08,260
Speaker 0: It's should I ignore it or should I give it back?

513
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,761
Speaker 1: I don't think.

514
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:09,284
Speaker 1: should I take it?

515
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:15,893
Speaker 1: but there's definitely that that the part of the brain I think is always Calculating whether or not you can get away with things.

516
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:21,335
Speaker 1: but on the internet There's no moral ambiguity because you're not you're not.

517
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:23,883
Speaker 1: all you're doing is saying something You're not doing anything.

518
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:29,880
Speaker 1: and I'll admit when I was in that the anonymous your chat with a stranger and Scott was over my shoulder.

519
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,620
Speaker 1: We're in there and we're typing and I talked to the stranger.

520
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:38,097
Speaker 1: I type two lines and I immediately feel this slight urge to just type your mom.

521
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:39,000
Speaker 0: I don't have that.

522
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:45,248
Speaker 0: Oh, no, your mom is sort of just become a reflexive say So it wasn't it wasn't a shit cocking urge.

523
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:46,071
Speaker 0: I don't really have that.

524
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:49,366
Speaker 1: but is if your mom is still a lesser degree of Shit cocking.

525
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:52,203
Speaker 1: I don't know Talking to a stranger.

526
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:53,948
Speaker 1: Hi, how are you your mom?

527
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:58,583
Speaker 0: Well that you know the content of it, but with knowing that who we are It's not.

528
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:00,740
Speaker 0: maybe maybe we knew who those people were.

529
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,611
Speaker 0: Maybe they're shit cocking is actually the same way.

530
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:04,535
Speaker 0: Your mom is for us.

531
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:05,780
Speaker 1: Is it really though?

532
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,622
Speaker 1: Which would I?

533
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:11,719
Speaker 1: join a chat with you and type a racial slur hundreds of times per second until you banned me?

534
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:22,786
Speaker 0: No only to come in with a different name and type a different racial slur But I mean like, you know I used to hang out with some Jews back in the day and we'd be like what up my kikes Yo, and it would be.

535
00:37:22,846 --> 00:37:23,790
Speaker 0: you know, it's a funny thing.

536
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:34,052
Speaker 0: But if you said that someone else it'd be like, oh shit You know, but like if I say it online I could go into a chat room and I'm like, you know A Jewish chat room like what up my kikes.

537
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:40,100
Speaker 0: it would be like shit cocking But if they would have known me and known our friends and had the context it wouldn't have been shit cocking.

538
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:45,937
Speaker 0: So there is I think I'm not gonna say that, you know, all shit cocking is just out of context.

539
00:37:45,977 --> 00:38:10,568
Speaker 0: non shit cocking but what I will say is I think there is a portion of shit cocking of People who have things that they say in the context of their friends and closer social groups Set that are bringing those things, you know sort of out of bounds, you know They're taking their in jokes taking them out into the chat rooms of public world where they are Taken out of context and those viewed as shit cocking.

540
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:15,545
Speaker 0: and that is a portion of shit cocking perhaps a very small portion But it is but it is there.

541
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:18,354
Speaker 1: it does exist, but at least in those cases, it's still.

542
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,400
Speaker 1: there's an expectation of communication.

543
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a hundred racial slurs in a flood.

544
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:25,377
Speaker 0: It's like one-liner plus.

545
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,765
Speaker 1: even then there's an Expectation of a response.

546
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:28,587
Speaker 1: notice how.

547
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:36,051
Speaker 1: I think that the real line between shit cock and not not in shit cock Specifically is whether or not you actually expect a response.

548
00:38:36,572 --> 00:38:41,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz flamers expect a response Response, you know trolls expect a response.

549
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,231
Speaker 0: Shitcockers are just putting bad words in a flood and that's it.

550
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,795
Speaker 0: They don't expect a response.

551
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:49,977
Speaker 0: They're not gonna talk to you.

552
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,979
Speaker 0: They're just Spitting out lots of bad words.

553
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:53,622
Speaker 0: Maybe

554
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:54,585
Speaker 1: I wonder some

555
00:38:54,625 --> 00:39:00,260
Speaker 0: of it is is definitely like, you know, the same way as like the little kid is not allowed to say bad Words, it's like oh my god, I can say bad words

556
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:05,115
Speaker 1: But there are so many of them and there are so many other places they could do this.

557
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:09,373
Speaker 1: the fact that they're doing it everywhere Simultaneously in real time 24/7 all the time.

558
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:10,338
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're doing.

559
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:10,780
Speaker 0: 24.

560
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,045
Speaker 1: I think that we have to try this.

561
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:18,374
Speaker 1: we have if we did a geek nights you stream or and got enough people in on Christmas no, is it the same person all day?

562
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:19,320
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a rotating.

563
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:25,840
Speaker 1: I'm saying that at any second there is like in any public space that is big enough to warrant notice.

564
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:28,190
Speaker 1: There are people trying to shit cock there.

565
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:35,200
Speaker 1: Mmm, kind of like how on the internet if you have a cable modem and no net someone is hitting all your ports all the time.

566
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:41,480
Speaker 1: Yep, except on the internet, you know, literally it's just people typing fuck at all your ports all the time, right?

567
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,782
Speaker 0: All right.

568
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:43,826
Speaker 0: So moving on.

569
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,934
Speaker 0: Oh, so let's you want to talk about.

570
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:47,440
Speaker 0: I had this problem today, right?

571
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:48,653
Speaker 0: What I wanted to do?

572
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:54,280
Speaker 0: As I'm on you stream, right and I'm sitting there and I want to teach some people some computer stuff, right?

573
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,003
Speaker 0: So what could I do?

574
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:57,356
Speaker 0: I could point my webcam at my screen.

575
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:57,960
Speaker 0: not good.

576
00:39:58,442 --> 00:40:01,298
Speaker 0: I could get a big whiteboard but rim didn't order it yet, right?

577
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:03,439
Speaker 1: Yeah I got a big Amazon order in the queue.

578
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:12,121
Speaker 0: I could or I could go and find something that would basically take my screen and stream what's on my screen, right and their decks Huh?

579
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:13,205
Speaker 1: Webex does it really?

580
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,794
Speaker 0: Well, well, but see the thing is a commercial product though.

581
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:17,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a commercial product, right?

582
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,852
Speaker 0: There's something else webcam max also commercial product.

583
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:22,197
Speaker 0: There are a bunch of free ones.

584
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:23,120
Speaker 0: They all suck.

585
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:29,520
Speaker 0: There are some that do it like, you know a go-to meeting or something like or like a VNC kind of thing.

586
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:30,785
Speaker 0: You know.

587
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,738
Speaker 0: the problem with those is that they're not.

588
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,580
Speaker 0: you know They're not like web-based video streams like YouTube like you stream.

589
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,389
Speaker 0: They're like, you know, you connect to my computer kind of.

590
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,495
Speaker 0: you know remote desktop things.

591
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:48,010
Speaker 0: It's completely different and Really there wasn't a solution there.

592
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,478
Speaker 0: just there just wasn't like everything out there like.

593
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:54,451
Speaker 0: there were some Some almost solutions, but everything was pooped.

594
00:40:54,471 --> 00:41:00,220
Speaker 0: There was like no way to take what was on my screen Stream it over streaming video in a web page.

595
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:16,100
Speaker 0: I'll allow you stream with good enough resolution for people to see what was in my terminal Right and have it be really accessible to the viewer so that lots of people could watch but also have the communication Mechanisms integrate, you know the chat room and me talking to them and the whole right.

596
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,880
Speaker 0: It's like I could have done this separate from the you stream.

597
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,380
Speaker 0: But then people would I join the you stream and then also join that and also get a piece of software.

598
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,260
Speaker 0: It was like so much work, you know just to make this happen where it should have been really easy.

599
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:42,624
Speaker 0: And I think the best solution that I came up with was get a webcam Bust it open take out the camera Get some sort of device that has a VGA cable in one end and then connects to the camera spot on the webcam on the Other end.

600
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,399
Speaker 0: so it's basically VGA to USB.

601
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:59,664
Speaker 0: So if it coming out of your video card into a device into your USB hole and thus it your computer treats Um, you know You duplicate the monitors using clone and then your computer would think the second monitor was also a webcam and would thus be able To stream it.

602
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:01,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, I couldn't find anything better than that.

603
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,992
Speaker 1: See now I feel like the the market here right now.

604
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:15,500
Speaker 1: in the short term if you stream just had an option to Share a desktop they do but it's it's you have to get the stupid program that caused money If you stream could just do it without doing that.

605
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,013
Speaker 0: Yeah The problem is on Windows right because the way Windows works the only that.

606
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:24,227
Speaker 1: what I was about to say is that if you just Share it as video that's still.

607
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:27,999
Speaker 1: that's a lot of bandwidth and it's gonna be really lossy and terrible compared to doing it.

608
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:38,438
Speaker 1: You know like with the MSTC exactly but MSTC is not set up by default - like you can't just use that through something like ustream Yep an x-forwarding.

609
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,261
Speaker 0: But yeah It's like.

610
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:48,200
Speaker 0: the way to do it right with the video part is you have to basically put a driver in Windows in between.

611
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:51,818
Speaker 0: You're like the mod is to be a webcam driver that picks up on.

612
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:55,360
Speaker 0: you know The video out and that's totally the wrong way to do it.

613
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,740
Speaker 0: But because of the architecture of Windows that's the way it has to be done.

614
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:02,574
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was something called like webcam studio for Linux.

615
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:03,900
Speaker 0: I couldn't even get it to work on Ubuntu.

616
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,599
Speaker 0: It just didn't install and I didn't have time for that shit.

617
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:10,680
Speaker 0: There are a lot of solutions that required a lot of work and I wasn't about to deal with them.

618
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,320
Speaker 1: I had that problem just looking for a screen scraper for my own desktop just to make some a way back.

619
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:18,960
Speaker 0: There's plenty of solutions to record your desk.

620
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:25,000
Speaker 1: Oh there are but even then in Linux many of them either don't work or are really shitty.

621
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,707
Speaker 0: Well xvidcap is fine.

622
00:43:26,767 --> 00:43:29,538
Speaker 0: It's okay, but just the thing is you have to do the encoding yourself.

623
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:31,938
Speaker 0: afterwards It makes a gigantic full res AVI.

624
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:38,440
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, but at least it doesn't destroy your performance like some of the other ones do that cuz they encode while they're going along.

625
00:43:38,842 --> 00:43:41,534
Speaker 0: So it's like your performance goes to shit and you can't work.

626
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:42,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, I got two cores.

627
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:43,524
Speaker 1: I could live with that.

628
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:46,420
Speaker 1: but now xvidcap worked pretty well, but it wasn't optimal.

629
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,966
Speaker 1: It was just the best one and it doesn't.

630
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:48,328
Speaker 0: dogs.

631
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:49,493
Speaker 0: vidcap also, right?

632
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:51,200
Speaker 0: It might record the your screen.

633
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:53,833
Speaker 0: It doesn't record the audio so you have to do.

634
00:43:53,853 --> 00:44:01,154
Speaker 0: you have to dub it later Yeah, or I mean or you push record in audacity at the same time Yeah, but that's nice still gets out of sync.

635
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:01,880
Speaker 1: You're gonna have trouble.

636
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,665
Speaker 0: Yeah You need to.

637
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:08,174
Speaker 0: you need to record that Audio dub it in a program that also takes the video into account.

638
00:44:08,194 --> 00:44:09,920
Speaker 0: so the dubbing is you know timed properly?

639
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:14,140
Speaker 1: Maybe our answer is just to have a big whiteboard and a camera.

640
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:31,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I also think having a computer where the VGA cable goes into you know Like a capture card or something would also Be like the correct solution that would work properly, you know It's still it just it really sucks because you shouldn't need hardware to do it, but I think we do

641
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:34,866
Speaker 1: All right, you got more.

642
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,256
Speaker 1: I I only remember the one I brought up.

643
00:44:37,337 --> 00:44:45,000
Speaker 0: so, okay Someone wanted us to do a show about regular expressions and I was sort of like, you know Why should we do a show on regular expressions?

644
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,910
Speaker 0: I mean first of all regular expressions are a very visual thing.

645
00:44:47,930 --> 00:45:00,147
Speaker 0: if you're gonna teach them to someone you need like terminals and things, you know open and text editors that you can, you know, visually show what's all about and Also everything I've learned about regular expressions.

646
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:01,131
Speaker 0: I've learned from the internet.

647
00:45:01,211 --> 00:45:03,017
Speaker 0: So this is also a web.

648
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:03,820
Speaker 0: There's one website.

649
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,824
Speaker 0: You'll know if you find it.

650
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:07,634
Speaker 0: It's very high up on Google if you do searches for regular expressions.

651
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:13,280
Speaker 0: It's sort of orange ish and Yep, I've used that because that website has really everything you need to know.

652
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:17,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, because even you know, I use I use them on a daily basis constantly.

653
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,198
Speaker 1: But every now all the time I'll forget some obscure syntax or I'll try to think of a like.

654
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,464
Speaker 1: I do something But it's kind of it.

655
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:26,340
Speaker 0: I pretty much need them as the need like a reference all the time.

656
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,280
Speaker 0: Cuz I don't remember hardly any of the syntax.

657
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:29,524
Speaker 1: I remember all the more like.

658
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:32,073
Speaker 0: I'll come up with a regular expression, but I'll need.

659
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:34,100
Speaker 0: I'll hate it because it's not perfectly optimal.

660
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:50,099
Speaker 1: So I'll have to go search around like get it optimized or half the time I'll end up I'll use like a reg X. that gets the job half done and Then my output gets pipe set off something to get my real output or Grant pipe grant pipe grab when I could have done it with one red egg reg X.

661
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,454
Speaker 0: Yep, just cuz you're not that good with the right.

662
00:45:52,474 --> 00:45:55,586
Speaker 0: You're not a reg X wizard You just sort of know enough to get them to go.

663
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,778
Speaker 0: few people are few people are indeed mostly pearl people.

664
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:00,620
Speaker 0: are reg X wizards.

665
00:46:00,701 --> 00:46:03,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I stare at command lines all day.

666
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:11,786
Speaker 1: All I do is parse logs and other logs and track stuff through logs and I use reg X is constantly like I don't know About 50 an hour.

667
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,472
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm trying to come up with a met.

668
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:15,278
Speaker 0: I mean Django is in.

669
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:16,924
Speaker 0: you know you're doing web stuff.

670
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:19,194
Speaker 0: URL is all about URLs.

671
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:24,260
Speaker 0: parsing URLs and Verifying form fields is all regular expressions.

672
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:24,601
Speaker 0: but

673
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:41,715
Speaker 1: for the layman if you're wondering what we're talking about if you a regular expression is a way to is a syntactical way to Parse text and generate an output that is transformed based on your rules so you can search through text Find what you're looking for in a very specific order.

674
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:42,940
Speaker 0: So so there's two parts.

675
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,775
Speaker 0: There's the matching right of text and there's also the parsing of text, right?

676
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:59,336
Speaker 0: So the matching goes something like this Let's say I have a regular expression that is like, you know You know, I I'm not gonna actually speak in the syntax of regular expressions cuz that won't.

677
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:00,400
Speaker 0: it'll just confuse the hell.

678
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,166
Speaker 1: It'll sound like DCS.

679
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,036
Speaker 0: But let's say let's say I'm looking for a phone number, right?

680
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,180
Speaker 0: I'm looking for a phone number.

681
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:08,580
Speaker 0: I want to know what the person typed in is a phone number.

682
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:16,600
Speaker 0: So we've I say three digits followed by a hyphen followed by three digits followed by a hyphen followed by four digits, right?

683
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:19,213
Speaker 0: So there's a language where I can type in.

684
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:33,413
Speaker 0: it would be something like, you know Backslash D curly brace 3 - backslash D curly brace 3 - backslash D curly brace 4 Right and what that would say is three digits followed by - Bob, right?

685
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:38,520
Speaker 0: So then I can tell the computer Here's my regular expression the shit with all the curly braces.

686
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:42,038
Speaker 0: Here's here's the part the thing the person typed in.

687
00:47:42,601 --> 00:47:43,343
Speaker 0: Does it match?

688
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:48,140
Speaker 0: and if the person typed in a phone number meaning three digits followed by a hyphen and so on?

689
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,078
Speaker 0: It'll give me a yes thumbs up.

690
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:58,398
Speaker 0: And if what they typed in has like letters in it or has four digits followed by three digits followed by a slash It'll say thumbs down.

691
00:47:58,881 --> 00:48:01,290
Speaker 0: So that's the first thing you can do with regular expressions.

692
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,820
Speaker 0: is you say does this match thus?

693
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:12,377
Speaker 0: You can take some unknown input that is text right or numbers and symbols and Determine if it matches this format that you're looking for.

694
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:13,000
Speaker 1: now to it.

695
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,371
Speaker 1: Just just to give you an idea of how powerful this is.

696
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:40,792
Speaker 1: just on this front part You could trivially write a rule that also, you know It could look for this three digits that may or may not be surrounded by parentheses followed by either a space or a hyphen or the parentheses from before and then four digits and Actually and then three more digits and then four digits with or without that whole first section so you could Find out like you could look for almost any format.

697
00:48:40,832 --> 00:48:42,199
Speaker 1: Someone could type a phone number in.

698
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,209
Speaker 0: Yeah go online and look for something.

699
00:48:44,391 --> 00:49:02,540
Speaker 0: go do searches for like Email address regular expressions and they'll people will have all these different crazy regular expressions that match like they match anything that could possibly be an email address and Don't match things that are not email addresses and it gets pretty crazy.

700
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,960
Speaker 0: But it's it's ridiculously powerful and it you know, it has lots and lots of applications.

701
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:15,512
Speaker 0: Like I said, let's say you're making a website and you have people typing things into the boxes on the website And you want to make sure that what they typed in is correct.

702
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:17,120
Speaker 0: You could use the regular expression.

703
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:26,720
Speaker 0: Let's say you've got a big file full of I don't know Like like data right and you want to look and it's just a text file.

704
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,840
Speaker 0: It's not in a nice spreadsheet or anything and you want to look for people who live in New York.

705
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:37,360
Speaker 0: So you can you know do a regular expression looking for and why capital with spaces around it?

706
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:46,520
Speaker 0: You know all sorts of you know different combinations of things that that will result in that being a you know And you could say give me any line in this file.

707
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,286
Speaker 0: This is what grep the program grep does.

708
00:49:48,326 --> 00:49:56,440
Speaker 0: you'd be like give me any line in this file where you see the letters NY And it will only spit out those lines in the file and not spit out the other lines.

709
00:49:56,581 --> 00:50:03,712
Speaker 1: Yep, and they're great for looking through log files, you know I want to see every message that were sent to or from this list of three clients.

710
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,540
Speaker 1: that involves a timeout on this thing.

711
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:11,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got this big old file full of all the logs everything that the web server has done for the past hour.

712
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:21,780
Speaker 0: Give me every line in this file that has the word error in it so I can just see the errors Or you can use them programmatically for things like log channels like say you write complex programs or demons.

713
00:50:22,382 --> 00:50:28,280
Speaker 1: So say you have every log line start with an integer from 1 to 9 and then a space and then the line.

714
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:49,760
Speaker 1: so you could designate say that Channel 1 is major errors channel 2 is minor errors channel 4 is debug channel 9 is like infer events No one cares about and you can have a log Masker that uses regular expressions that will basically say if the log line I'm about to write is in channel 4, you know, it begins with an integer for then write it.

715
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,887
Speaker 1: Otherwise don't unless I change the log mask.

716
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:52,269
Speaker 1: Yep.

717
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,589
Speaker 0: So there are lots and lots of ways to just use the matching Capabilities of regular expressions.

718
00:50:57,609 --> 00:50:59,520
Speaker 0: We haven't even scratched the surface on that, right?

719
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,166
Speaker 0: I mean you use something like awk.

720
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,451
Speaker 0: you're going way you can.

721
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:06,846
Speaker 0: it's crazy powerful crazy powerful But you think that's powerful.

722
00:51:06,906 --> 00:51:13,363
Speaker 0: regular expressions have one other function and that is the you know the parsing Functionality.

723
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,579
Speaker 0: so what you can do is you can say let's say I'm do I'll use the phone number again, right?

724
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,949
Speaker 0: So I'm doing the phone number and the phone number.

725
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,240
Speaker 0: has you know that area code at the beginning, right?

726
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:28,220
Speaker 0: So I can say match a phone number three digits followed by whatever followed by three digits followed by four right four digits.

727
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:32,260
Speaker 0: But I put some parentheses around those first three digits.

728
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:45,280
Speaker 0: Now I can say all right look at this whole big file Find anything that matches a phone number and then spit out just the just the area code part.

729
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,497
Speaker 0: Give me that area code part so you can extract parts of what you have matched, right?

730
00:51:50,517 --> 00:52:03,540
Speaker 0: It's like I could match Email addresses and I can just pull out just the domain part, you know I could like just give me all the domains and I could see like how many Yahoo.com email addresses are in here how many gmail.com email addresses are in here?

731
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:11,129
Speaker 0: You know, I could go in and you could you know, so by pulling out different parts You can actually start to do some really crazy stuff.

732
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:14,220
Speaker 0: Like I have a script I wrote that will rename.

733
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,760
Speaker 0: You know, you download an anime fan sub right and the file name is this crazy fucked up thing, right?

734
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,945
Speaker 0: You've got and people do it all different ways You know and they've got.

735
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,940
Speaker 0: they put in like the name of the fan sub are in there.

736
00:52:25,161 --> 00:52:26,649
Speaker 0: You got the episode number in there.

737
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,800
Speaker 0: You got the file extension in there, right?

738
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,244
Speaker 0: You got all this junk in there.

739
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:37,646
Speaker 0: So I'll wrote this program that basically it checks to see if you know This, you know file.

740
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:41,400
Speaker 0: it looks at all the file names in the folder and it says does this file name match?

741
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,649
Speaker 0: You know, is it a anime fan sub?

742
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:48,360
Speaker 0: All right, so it mostly looks for like an MKV or a VI file extension.

743
00:52:48,521 --> 00:52:57,540
Speaker 0: Right, then it says if it is Extract out right the name of the show and extract out the episode number, right?

744
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:05,140
Speaker 0: Get rid of the rest of the shit and rename it to Name of show space - space episode number dot file extension.

745
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,090
Speaker 1: You could even really set it up to where.

746
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:10,608
Speaker 1: if you can't parse it properly Like you can set up the expression to where.

747
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:17,620
Speaker 1: if it doesn't fit any of your cases Flag it with like, you know four X's at the beginning and then I'll go through and sort those manual.

748
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could you know and then I can you know.

749
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,460
Speaker 0: Once I see that that case didn't match I can then go back and modify my regular expression to match that case in the future.

750
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:32,040
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's the regular expressions are you know an evolving thing sometimes when you don't have, you know consistency.

751
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,540
Speaker 0: It's like when you have some consistently structured textual data.

752
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:40,580
Speaker 0: They're very useful because you can process large quantities very easily and very reliably.

753
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:52,080
Speaker 0: But when you have small amounts of inconsistent data or even large amounts of inconsistent data They're equally powerful because it's the only thing you can do to search inconsistent data is a regular expression.

754
00:53:52,421 --> 00:54:04,408
Speaker 0: There's no way to search something that's all fucked up, you know with an with an actual search function because you know something that's more straightforward because you're not gonna find anything and That's that's what regular expressions are all about.

755
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:23,380
Speaker 0: And if you have to deal, you know with text or matching or searching or finding and replacing or Renaming or verifying or anything along those lines, you know in computers regular expressions is something you should learn And I think as you know, there really isn't going to be a replacement for them.

756
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,053
Speaker 0: They're pretty much it, you know, and they're gonna be it for quite a long time.

757
00:54:27,214 --> 00:54:34,720
Speaker 0: I mean, we'll still be using regular expressions probably 10 if not 20 years from now that there's really nothing else we can do about it.

758
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,172
Speaker 1: We'll be using them until we have semantic computing.

759
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:38,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much so.

760
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:46,440
Speaker 0: It's worth your while to learn them and to learn how to use them and to learn to write simple scripty programs that utilize them.

761
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,826
Speaker 0: Because that you know.

762
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:54,240
Speaker 0: learn, you know, there are two the main things you have to learn, you know You can learn said which is like this straightforward regular expression tool.

763
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:58,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can learn auk which is a super powerful regular expression tool.

764
00:54:58,742 --> 00:55:03,540
Speaker 1: You can and you can learn simple way to remember say grant is a stream editor.

765
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:10,360
Speaker 1: So you can basically take a file pipe it into said and then the output will be transformed by whatever expression you build.

766
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:16,060
Speaker 1: So you could say replace the letter a with the letter F on every file on my hard drive.

767
00:55:16,422 --> 00:55:17,830
Speaker 0: yep, said can do that right.

768
00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:20,144
Speaker 0: auk is basically.

769
00:55:20,225 --> 00:55:25,717
Speaker 0: you put something into auk and you give auk a bunch of expressions and you say auk whenever you see this expression.

770
00:55:25,758 --> 00:55:33,846
Speaker 0: do this So it can go through a file or whatever you give to it and whenever it sees a certain expression that it's looking for It does something right.

771
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:36,816
Speaker 0: so you that's in ridiculously powerful.

772
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:40,840
Speaker 0: Once you learn how to use it You can use grep which is pretty much search for something.

773
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,700
Speaker 0: So you got a folder full of files and you want to look, you know through those files.

774
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:51,700
Speaker 0: Let's say you're working on a program and there's a function called fubar and you don't know which file the fubar function is in.

775
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,843
Speaker 0: Well grep is the winner.

776
00:55:53,746 --> 00:56:13,093
Speaker 0: and lastly, you know in your programming language of choice Python Ruby Perl bash Whatever you can learn how to use the regular expression tools Provided by that programming language to write full-on programs that can use regular expressions for searching replacing verifying matching whatever PHP whatever.

777
00:56:13,396 --> 00:56:13,819
Speaker 0: it's all good.

778
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:18,100
Speaker 1: All right, we've actually gone on pretty well and maybe we can end there.

779
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:18,683
Speaker 0: You don't want to.

780
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:20,151
Speaker 0: you want to do another one or that's it.

781
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:20,915
Speaker 1: It's been a while.

782
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:21,840
Speaker 1: I think we can stop for now.

783
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,531
Speaker 1: I think I think it was a good proof of concept and it killed a Monday.

784
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:25,234
Speaker 0: All right.

785
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:25,957
Speaker 0: All right.

786
00:56:25,998 --> 00:56:35,791
Speaker 1: Yes This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

787
00:56:35,811 --> 00:56:37,940

Speaker 1: We have video games board games and RPGs.

792
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:06,720
Speaker 1: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

800
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:47,016
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows.

801
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:48,620
Speaker 0: It's actually recorded at night.
