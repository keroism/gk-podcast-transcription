00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:14,678
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,608
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:22,810
Speaker 1: tonight We're back after the longest hiatus in geek nights history to talk about Scott's crashy computer.

5
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:29,807
Speaker 1: Let's do this But I will say that I too had an error where I had a crash.

6
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:44,839
Speaker 1: you do Remember the computer not the previous one that looked like that one down there But the one that was one before that with the silver case with the door on it that we used to record geek nights on with Our door and all that nonsense.

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,507
Speaker 1: No, that was the computer that Crashed a few times while we were recording geek nights.

8
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:58,059
Speaker 1: great That was the one that had a lot of weird crash issues that I resolved by Unplugging all the USB connectors on the case.

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,142
Speaker 1: that case was a piece of shit.

10
00:00:59,162 --> 00:00:59,825
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

11
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,817
Speaker 1: Took me a while to figure that out though Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:03,996
Speaker 0: But yeah Welcome.

13
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:05,289
Speaker 1: there's probably some people who?

14
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,150
Speaker 1: Subscribed to this because they saw us at one of the many conventions we performed at recently.

15
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:18,581
Speaker 1: I'm sorry And then we just didn't do any shows and our website didn't update for a whole month because we've been going to a lot of Conventions and things.

16
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,350
Speaker 0: I'm not sorry.

17
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:27,230
Speaker 1: Yeah This I think this literally is the longest hiatus geek nice has ever had good because we had four consecutive weekends of travel.

18
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,430
Speaker 0: Can we extend this hiatus?

19
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:33,066
Speaker 1: Well, you're here and we're both hungry, but we're doing the show anyway.

20
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:37,448
Speaker 1: the problem is We have more Tuesday content.

21
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:41,748
Speaker 1: Then we could possibly get out in the rest of this year on our current schedule.

22
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:41,969
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

23
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't have a lot of Monday content unless we do tech news roundups.

24
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,478
Speaker 1: Actually, we got a pretty good cue a Wednesday content.

25
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,605
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Thursday.

26
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:51,930
Speaker 1: I'm sure we can make that happen.

27
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,275
Speaker 1: So really what is the problem now?

28
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,724
Speaker 0: Yes, we will bail on the Thursday episode.

29
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:57,090
Speaker 1: I got a good Thursday.

30
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,450
Speaker 0: Listen if you can make it to March you can do your at the annual tech news roundup of March.

31
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:02,555
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so soon.

32
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:03,540
Speaker 1: That's why I'm feeling it.

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,263
Speaker 1: I'll jump the gun.

34
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how you got this far.

35
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,476
Speaker 0: You kept bailing on Monday episodes.

36
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:10,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like we should just change the format of Monday.

37
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:12,946
Speaker 0: All right What's the format gonna be tech news roundup?

38
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:13,208
Speaker 1: No?

39
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,182
Speaker 0: Any I'm okay with changing the format.

40
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,570
Speaker 0: I'm not okay with tech news, right?

41
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,435
Speaker 1: How about tech opinion?

42
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:26,478
Speaker 1: like we pick some topic and we purely talk about our own personal opinions on it as it's hard to have An opinion about something as objective as a computer.

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,669
Speaker 1: What about use of technology and tech transfer and all that stuff?

44
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,550
Speaker 1: Like here is a technology and that has pros and cons and issues.

45
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:37,690
Speaker 1: Do we have any strong opinions about how it should be regulated or used?

46
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,310
Speaker 0: My opinion all the things is the same which is let's get to cyber dystopia as quickly as humanly possible.

47
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,450
Speaker 1: I would still be a kind of sucks.

48
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,570
Speaker 1: I don't want to be like eating hot dogs out of the garbage while I'm using my neural network to hack a corporation.

49
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,846
Speaker 0: That's who your cyber dystopia character is.

50
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:51,390
Speaker 0: That's a shame.

51
00:02:52,334 --> 00:03:03,268
Speaker 1: Be a character is section 9 agent Our monkey hair, you know, my cyber dystopia character is hot elf because that is an option thanks to shadow, right?

52
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:03,730
Speaker 0: That's right.

53
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,392
Speaker 0: There you go.

54
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:09,470
Speaker 0: Now you're ready for the cyber dystopia hot elf man, but I'm just hot elf in Seattle and it's not a dystopia.

55
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,734
Speaker 1: I'm in the elite and it's awesome.

56
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:14,468
Speaker 0: That's what it's a cyber dystopia because hot dog trash guy is still there.

57
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:15,070
Speaker 0: You're just not him.

58
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,382
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I'm in Seattle.

59
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:16,908
Speaker 1: It's totally cool.

60
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,460
Speaker 1: I'll work on dunk Lisanne's presidential campaign or whatever.

61
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,349
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be tropical Aramaki with the Hawaiian shirt.

62
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:29,990
Speaker 1: So yeah, we are back if you subscribe to this because you thought we were entertaining at a convention.

63
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,149
Speaker 1: This is when you learn the truth.

64
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,114
Speaker 1: If you sigh warned you.

65
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:42,170

66
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:45,290
Speaker 1: But I'm not publishing it for like another week because I just published two other videos.

67
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:46,254
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

68
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:47,339

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:47,901
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit.

70
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:55,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're uh, we're back We're doing stuff and stay tuned for a whole bunch of content cuz we're actually really wrapping up our content creation.

71
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,295
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's all meta after that.

72
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,599
Speaker 1: So you got any tech news.

73
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,902
Speaker 1: on this tech news Monday.

74
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:06,119
Speaker 0: It's older news, but it checks out Since we've been on hiatus so long.

75
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,564
Speaker 0: There's a news back in December.

76
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:08,346
Speaker 0: I wanted to talk about.

77
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:13,192
Speaker 0: we didn't have an opportunity to do so, yep, so I don't know.

78
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,596
Speaker 0: people know if you're not computery.

79
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:19,529
Speaker 0: people's think I'll SSH and it's used to control one computer from another computer, right?

80
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,482
Speaker 0: It's like I'm sitting at this computer, but I want to use that computer.

81
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:27,824
Speaker 0: that's in another room another building Another part of the world, right?

82
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:36,163
Speaker 0: I learned about it back in college when I would be in my dorm or my apartment and I want to use a computer in The lab I would connect it with these secure shell.

83
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is an IT.

84
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,810
Speaker 1: We actually I use telnet for a lot of that because we're old but anyway, so it's a way to securely do it.

85
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,596
Speaker 0: There are many unsecure ways before tell

86
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:49,710
Speaker 1: that is literally just the keys you type are in the clear over the internet including your point

87
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:59,065
Speaker 0: Is secure shell is mostly a thing that works really well and is designed for Unix Linux Starnix machines also max kind of a little bit, right?

88
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:03,763
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you're on Windows It's really hard to SSH into a Windows machine.

89
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:10,788
Speaker 1: You'd have to like install some like SSH server and it's all weird and then it's got us like it's got to pass through to the bullshit.

90
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:11,575
Speaker 1: windows Come at.

91
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:17,790
Speaker 0: it doesn't work nicely Right, and then if you try to SSH from a Windows machine, that's a little easier.

92
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,042
Speaker 1: Well, because you download putty he would download putty.

93
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,128
Speaker 0: There's a program called putty.

94
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,870
Speaker 0: Putty that was an SSH client for Windows.

95
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,522
Speaker 1: So I assume your news is that we no longer need to download putty.

96
00:05:27,663 --> 00:05:31,389
Speaker 0: and the thing about downloading putty Is that putty while it worked just fine?

97
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:36,348
Speaker 0: Had a lot of issues, they're really old-fashioned gooey kind of kind of annoying to use.

98
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,350
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people would make forks of putty like tabbed putty or a kitty was one that I used is pretty popular.

99
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, I pretty much like putty just never integrated well with any windows.

100
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is putty is not.

101
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,569
Speaker 1: he had his own keys like you want to use.

102
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,798
Speaker 1: It's hard to trust putty.

103
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:57,550
Speaker 0: It's like everyone uses it and you could pretty sure you can trust it.

104
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,570
Speaker 1: But then you go to the putty website you're like, really?

105
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:09,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you get putty from the shady fucking website shiark.greenend.org.uk and the most common question people ask about this is is that really the official putty site?

106
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:18,130
Speaker 0: Yes, yes it is so Thankfully is a huge huge change for anyone who uses SSH and Windows.

107
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:25,920
Speaker 0: Windows is going to come with or may already be coming with a Not just an SSH client that's built in.

108
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:31,520
Speaker 0: open SSH the real SSH client One true SSH client and server opening.

109
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,290
Speaker 1: it's gonna work this with the keys and all the stuff the same way.

110
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,122
Speaker 0: My Linux just fucking built into Windows so you can go to a Windows machine.

111
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,810
Speaker 0: That's brand-new your mom's Windows machine, whatever.

112
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:50,105
Speaker 0: Just open up the command line and type SSH space and connect to somewhere and be good to go No more putty death to putty rip putty.

113
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:55,433
Speaker 0: I think the Whatever your putty was made - 2018.

114
00:06:55,433 --> 00:07:01,285
Speaker 1: the really interesting part about this is Why didn't this happen ten years ago?

115
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:04,718
Speaker 0: Cuz Microsoft Yeah, but they noticed that people are actually using.

116
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:10,161
Speaker 0: they finally made a somewhat good thing with that Linux on Windows Thingy that you can get.

117
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:15,509
Speaker 0: yeah, they're like, whoa If we actually do a good job of this people actually use it and stop using the sigma and garbage.

118
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,016
Speaker 0: The competition wasn't exactly stiff.

119
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:23,570
Speaker 1: There are two kinds of people people who have tried to use sing when and people are happy.

120
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,960
Speaker 1: So anyway ever try to compile something in Sigmund.

121
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,407
Speaker 0: I successfully compiled things in Sigmund but the point is they Realize that if they do a good job of this, it's like people actually fucking use it.

122
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:35,753
Speaker 0: So I go, okay We'll do it.

123
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,397
Speaker 0: It's not gonna.

124
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:41,225
Speaker 0: you know, you know, I think it's a lot of it Also has to do with the new CEO right Microsoft.

125
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,029
Speaker 0: Yeah new things.

126
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:49,359
Speaker 0: well also I just wouldn't have it in the Bill Gates days when it was and the or the Bald guy days if I had to guess.

127
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,350
Speaker 1: actually the reason I really think this is had bomber.

128
00:07:52,751 --> 00:08:06,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is happening now is that there was a brief period where Linux on the desktop Wasn't really a viable competitor for Windows But it it almost was like it was pretty close for a lot of basic use cases.

129
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:19,770
Speaker 1: if you're a corporate user No one's playing games and you just needed like some office shit and like spreadsheets You could make a case to use like open office and Linux and that era rapidly disappeared.

130
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:31,390
Speaker 1: And I feel like Microsoft is comfortable with the fact that Windows is the only viable alternative to OS X. So as a result, they do not need to in any way worry about Linux on the desktop ever returning.

131
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:39,438
Speaker 1: If they and in fact, I'm pretty sure if a non Windows non Apple Desktop OS ever becomes viable again.

132
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,086
Speaker 1: It will not be Linux or even POSIX based.

133
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,349
Speaker 1: It'll be some totally new thing.

134
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,917
Speaker 1: but what is funny is that they brought this in and we're all excited about it, but and Anyone who works like crap?

135
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:53,543
Speaker 1: Oh IT help desk in a company.

136
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,249
Speaker 1: They did take away telnet.

137
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:57,457
Speaker 1: Hell that isn't in Windows anymore.

138
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:59,747
Speaker 0: And you might think good still get it.

139
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,789
Speaker 0: Can't you get it from the Go to this like Windows thing?

140
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:16,509
Speaker 0: Alright, so if you don't know I'm sure you can find a video online explaining this to you But if you go in Windows go to the area in the control panel where you can like add and remove programs and there'll be Some link on the left side that rims gonna go to it so we can find out exactly where it is.

141
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,470
Speaker 1: Remember any of this stuff is link on the left side.

142
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,910
Speaker 0: That's like add Windows features or something turn Windows features on and off.

143
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the ones you go to turn Windows features on and off and you'll get this Look at all this nonsense.

144
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:31,300
Speaker 0: It's an old-school dialogue.

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,611
Speaker 0: They're telling that client exactly and has all these fucking checkboxes in it Tftp.

146
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

147
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:42,310
Speaker 0: This is a secret thing where you can get stuff that is built into Windows software.

148
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:45,610
Speaker 0: That's just not automatically installed into Windows software.

149
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:54,538
Speaker 0: so you can go to this check this dialogue and all you gotta do is click check boxes or unclick them to add more features to Windows if you need them.

150
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,550
Speaker 0: if you're not a tech person you can ignore this window forever.

151
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:01,969
Speaker 0: If you are a tech person this window holds untold treasure.

152
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:06,230
Speaker 1: now You might ask but rim and Scott didn't you just say that telnet is unencrypted into your garbage?

153
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,114
Speaker 1: And yes, that is true.

154
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:09,670
Speaker 0: You can use tone that for other things like playing a mud or whatever.

155
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:11,333
Speaker 1: There's the you.

156
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:14,084
Speaker 1: the only reason anyone uses telnet is that play mud.

157
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,750
Speaker 1: you're on a shitty not anymore.

158
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:19,050
Speaker 1: Now these go to a web browser and connect to the mud through the web browser.

159
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:21,058
Speaker 1: There's some sort of like web browser.

160
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,725
Speaker 0: just has a JavaScript town that client in it.

161
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:24,473
Speaker 1: No, possibly Definitely.

162
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:25,941
Speaker 1: I mean if it's a modern mud.

163
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:33,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure modern muds Do not even bother with the telnet protocol listing on port 22 or whatever about that, but it's not 20.

164
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,237
Speaker 1: I forget what I actually 23 I forget.

165
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:36,844
Speaker 1: reported 22 is this is yeah.

166
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:48,389
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway Telnet is used by Mostly like low-level IT people because they're stuck on a shitty Windows box for which if you're doing like real IT You kind of need like a Linux box to do that kind of stuff.

167
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:55,370
Speaker 1: They want to see not just if they can ping something because being usually doesn't work through modern firewalls like people block ICMP.

168
00:10:56,151 --> 00:11:00,990
Speaker 1: They want to connect to a remote port and see if something comes back to prove that they can connect to it.

169
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,850
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and there's really no way to do that in Windows unless you write some code or use telnet or download an application.

170
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,001
Speaker 1: But most of the applications that do that well cost money or on Linux.

171
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:11,503
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

172
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:17,310
Speaker 1: So in some other news You might know and this will come up in the main bit about Scott's crashing computer.

173
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:26,002
Speaker 1: But I bought my Nvidia GTX 1080 some time ago when I built my new computer Mm-hmm, and it was probably like $500.

174
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:32,830
Speaker 0: I could look I forget how much I paid probably around 500 I imagine but that's usually what an 8 an Nvidia 80 series GPU costs.

175
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:37,470
Speaker 1: And I got to tell you it was worth it because I did some benchmarking based on like rendering.

176
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,819
Speaker 0: Everybody knows the 1080 is godlike.

177
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:40,381
Speaker 0: You don't got it.

178
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,227
Speaker 0: You don't got a. you didn't make it.

179
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:47,726
Speaker 1: what you bragging about What I'm about to say is it is almost definitely better than you need.

180
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:48,770
Speaker 1: you do not need one.

181
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, 1070 is pretty real good.

182
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:51,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1060 is pretty fun.

183
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,802
Speaker 0: I've actually like.

184
00:11:52,862 --> 00:12:02,810
Speaker 0: I thought 1060 is not good enough, but no actually Actually, so if you want to get like real, you know forget the actual benchmarks you see around the world.

185
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:12,103
Speaker 0: Right, if you're playing a modern video game a 1060 is gonna get you the the FPS like the 4050 FPS Maybe to make it playable.

186
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:12,709
Speaker 0: just fine.

187
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:22,267
Speaker 0: The 1070 is gonna get you that rock-solid 60 FPS v-sync that you can play it super smooth with all the settings the 1070 will also get you.

188
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,018
Speaker 1: if you have a high Res monitor you can run at that res.

189
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:30,176
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and 1080 is gonna get you god mode 4k screen 140 FPS.

190
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,783
Speaker 0: You don't need the 1080 and my

191
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:34,467
Speaker 1: current computer

192
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:34,929
Speaker 0: and going

193
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:52,490
Speaker 1: on I can play overwatch on the like fully like I've literally turned everything up to the max 100% and I can simultaneously stream that overwatch and Also encode that overwatch with a different setting as a video on my hard drive.

194
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:57,425
Speaker 1: I have also played overwatch in epic mode while rendering video out of Premiere.

195
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:57,867
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

196
00:12:58,288 --> 00:12:59,487
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous You don't need it.

197
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:06,937
Speaker 1: But if I wanted to buy that 1080 today or God help me a 1070 It would cost a lot more than I paid.

198
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:08,040
Speaker 0: that makes no sense.

199
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,750
Speaker 0: GPUs and computer things are like cars value goes down over time.

200
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:14,489
Speaker 0: Why would the value of a GPU possibly go up?

201
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:24,020
Speaker 1: So the last time this happened to me we were in our IT and I needed more RAM desperately and there was an earthquake in Taiwan and RAM got real fucking expensive.

202
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,110
Speaker 0: It was rare and there wasn't a lot of variety in RAM in those days.

203
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,383
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was like there was almost a year where unless you had a lot of money.

204
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:34,069
Speaker 0: There's also the RDRAM debacle haha, oh RDRAM.

205
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:38,385
Speaker 1: But so Scott, why can't we buy video cards right now?

206
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,910
Speaker 0: There's them fucking coins.

207
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:46,490
Speaker 0: If I see anyone mining any fucking coins, yeah, I'm gonna cut you don't take your GPUs.

208
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:48,236
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna do.

209
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:49,201
Speaker 1: stupid aetherium.

210
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,900
Speaker 1: and yeah as we were talking for the show It ain't the Bitcoin bitcoins bad.

211
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,248
Speaker 0: See that's the thing is you might wonder.

212
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,462
Speaker 0: Well, wait Why is it only now that you can't buy a GPU on Newegg?

213
00:13:57,763 --> 00:13:59,390
Speaker 0: bitcoins been around for years now?

214
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:06,410
Speaker 0: It's like this is why because of the way Bitcoin is GPUs don't really help you mine Bitcoin that much right?

215
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,714
Speaker 0: So no one gives a shit.

216
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:11,490
Speaker 0: if we don't who cares about actual real-deal Bitcoin gives a shit about GPUs?

217
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:17,250
Speaker 0: It's all these newfangled coins that are based on aetherium and those other slightly different coin algorithms.

218
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:26,686
Speaker 0: GPUs help you mine those real easy like so people are now Buying all the GPUs and so gamers who just want one 1080 just one.

219
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,035
Speaker 1: Does one help a nerd?

220
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:30,758
Speaker 0: go on Newegg?

221
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:33,707
Speaker 0: You can't get one or it's like a thousand dollars.

222
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,410
Speaker 1: All right, here we go.

223
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,329
Speaker 1: 1060s going for 400 this one gaming g4 GTX 1080 like a normal one.

224
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,869
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm nine seventy nine.

225
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,982
Speaker 0: Good God It's some horseshit right here.

226
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:52,418
Speaker 0: the TI one $1,500 just make a lot.

227
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:55,130
Speaker 0: I mean mining these coins is only for money laundering.

228
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,647
Speaker 0: We just make it illegal and have death penalty and be done with it.

229
00:14:57,849 --> 00:14:58,815
Speaker 1: now I want to be very clear.

230
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,970
Speaker 1: there is a. there is a time and a place for animate.

231
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:06,830
Speaker 1: There is a time and there's a place for blockchain like technology and distributed ledgers and all those things.

232
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:12,150
Speaker 0: There is also a time and a place for it's fine, but you don't have to have some mining aspect.

233
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,880
Speaker 0: Don't give the coins to someone just for burning electricity.

234
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,470
Speaker 0: give the coins out for someone who's so mining.

235
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:24,990
Speaker 1: There's different ways to mine coins or to extend the ledger like proof of work versus proof of stake and all these other algorithms.

236
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,090
Speaker 1: That's not the point.

237
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:38,349
Speaker 1: The point is that once again The real world has a pressure on a thing that is otherwise a very niche audience and as a result that niche audience is dwarfed by this completely unrelated use case.

238
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:42,124
Speaker 1: and A lot of nerds are saying why doesn't the government do something?

239
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:43,530
Speaker 1: Why doesn't nvidia do something?

240
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:44,938
Speaker 1: So I got a story for you.

241
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:54,010
Speaker 1: Scott just now like earlier today Pointed me at a link to some film on Amazon and told me to buy him three packages of this film.

242
00:15:54,474 --> 00:16:02,050
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so I got this instant camera I talked about and even it's a long time ago, but finally I got a camera that shoots this Polaroid like square film.

243
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:03,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

244
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:06,444
Speaker 1: It's it's instant camera though much like Tide Pods.

245
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:07,607
Speaker 1: Do not bite the film.

246
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:08,249
Speaker 1: It'll burn you.

247
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know about that.

248
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:13,169
Speaker 0: No, there's there's some Recommend biting any kind of film.

249
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:16,900
Speaker 1: We talk about the film in my thing at the day.

250
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,170
Speaker 0: don't fight that yeah, but Amazon Oh as the best price for this film, but they only let you buy daddy three packs.

251
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:23,567
Speaker 0: Yeah.

252
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:34,690
Speaker 0: So to get around this and I so I bought three packs and then I tried to add three more to the cart and it Said no, so I checked out I got the delivery then I went to Amazon and I added three more to the cart and it said yes.

253
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:40,196
Speaker 0: But then when I actually click the checkout button it said no One step further right.

254
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:44,507
Speaker 0: so then I'm like, oh rim buy me three packs done and done.

255
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:54,664
Speaker 0: It's like, okay see Nvidia is thinking of applying the sort of one GPU limit to you know, and I think you can see why this is not effective.

256
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,487
Speaker 0: and the thing is I'm.

257
00:16:55,567 --> 00:17:00,569
Speaker 0: I was Waiting and hoping for 1180s to come out which I guess should come soon.

258
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:03,763
Speaker 0: But there's all these all these coin.

259
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,230
Speaker 0: people buy them up, right?

260
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:09,046
Speaker 0: I got to get in on that initial order and make sure I get an MSRP, you know, 1180.

261
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:14,510
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, so in some other news, this is sort of a this is like Brock.

262
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:24,944
Speaker 1: I'm bringing up all these stories that I've just seen but this has been happening off and on but it's happening with Such frequency now that Google and Apple are actually rerouting their buses to protect their employees.

263
00:17:24,964 --> 00:17:43,850
Speaker 1: if you don't know in the places where Companies like Google Apple Amazon San Francisco Mountain View basically evil land, California Also known as Silicon Valley the civil infrastructure of mass transit Pretty much everywhere in America outside of New York City and parts of Boston is garbage, right?

264
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,261
Speaker 0: So basically it costs even more to live in Silicon Valley than it does in New York But there's no subway to take it away.

265
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:50,350
Speaker 0: No subway does know nothing.

266
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:59,216
Speaker 0: So everybody lives in these, you know far away places where they can barely afford to live and then the companies themselves Provide buses because the city can't do it.

267
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, bring their employees to work.

268
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:03,992
Speaker 1: Istanbul's like that and it's a nightmare Mm-hmm.

269
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:11,459
Speaker 1: So basically the real answer is the government should fund mass transit with taxpayer dollars and also bands.

270
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:22,305
Speaker 0: they should also yeah, but I was gonna say allow tall buildings so that you can have cheaper housing or Ban people driving into cities and put transit centers in suburbs.

271
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,689
Speaker 0: ban cars.

272
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:33,183
Speaker 1: Yeah done Because these companies have such value in their employees and their business models They can totally afford.

273
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:35,573
Speaker 1: just build their own Transportation infrastructure.

274
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,727
Speaker 1: if the city's won't do it and this is a problem get your cyber dystopia.

275
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:40,490
Speaker 0: It's a corporate town.

276
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:49,949
Speaker 1: yep, so the Corp man can take the Corp bus to his Corp job and live in his Corp house and everyone else in the City is basically fucked in traffic.

277
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,818
Speaker 1: So people have been attacking the buses.

278
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:54,380
Speaker 0: Good job.

279
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,009
Speaker 1: Like I don't think that's the right solution.

280
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:57,289
Speaker 0: Why not?

281
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:58,774
Speaker 1: Why?

282
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,170
Speaker 1: how will that solve the problem?

283
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:04,150
Speaker 0: Maybe Google will stop providing the bus if it's dangerous?

284
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:13,547
Speaker 1: No so what Google is doing is actually they're using algorithms and doing things to Reroute the buses and randomize their paths to try to avoid these attacks.

285
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:19,240
Speaker 0: All right good It's hard to tell you're causing real suffering to the to the man.

286
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,724
Speaker 1: good job, but here's the problem.

287
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:25,650
Speaker 1: by providing these services They're actually making one of the problems better.

288
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,984
Speaker 1: They are reducing the traffic and they are providing public transport.

289
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:32,598
Speaker 1: There's providing for a certain sub Segment of the population.

290
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,590
Speaker 0: it should make it intolerable for them to be there.

291
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,490
Speaker 0: So they get their asses out, but where are they gonna go?

292
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,806
Speaker 1: They'll have the same problem anywhere unless they go to New York, huh?

293
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,089
Speaker 0: Yeah companies belong.

294
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,669
Speaker 0: Why don't you build the Google train?

295
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:52,230
Speaker 1: But we all have to ride on it because it's a you know A public thing the MTA all I'm saying my only point about this news because this could be a whole show on its own.

296
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,154
Speaker 1: I want to do a show on it, but Scott doesn't want to Because he's boring.

297
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,359
Speaker 0: I just say it's not a Monday show.

298
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,925
Speaker 1: I can't think of you a Monday show.

299
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:00,110
Speaker 0: It's not a Monday topic.

300
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,721
Speaker 1: I think tech transfer is a viable Monday.

301
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,006
Speaker 0: It's not a Monday topic.

302
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:10,879
Speaker 0: moral and morals Google if this was happening in Fucking Kansas City's is a non tech company.

303
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,707
Speaker 0: It wouldn't even be onion in the news at all.

304
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:13,450
Speaker 0: You wouldn't even hear bad.

305
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,177
Speaker 1: I think it would still be a Monday thing.

306
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:15,941
Speaker 1: No, I would.

307
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,050
Speaker 1: I would treat it as a Monday thing anyway.

308
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:31,643
Speaker 1: the fact that these attacks are escalating is something to pay attention to because the divide between people with technology jobs and Literally everyone else in America is growing faster than it's shrinking.

309
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:33,590
Speaker 0: It's already grown to near.

310
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,682
Speaker 1: I mean Scott and like people like us our salaries go up and up and up and anyone who doesn't have a tech job Their salaries are going down and down down.

311
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:43,381
Speaker 0: everyone who works in my company Even the not intent people I assume gets the same raises every year.

312
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:44,024
Speaker 1: Yep.

313
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:44,868
Speaker 1: So there is.

314
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:52,449
Speaker 1: This is not coming to a head but it's reached an escalation point and I fear it will soon reach an inflection point.

315
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:53,794
Speaker 0: good I can't wait.

316
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,721
Speaker 1: So, uh, it's mother news.

317
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,910
Speaker 0: You might have noticed that many news is he got here?

318
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,589
Speaker 1: I could just stop and go right into.

319
00:21:00,531 --> 00:21:00,893
Speaker 0: I do.

320
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:03,603
Speaker 0: I try to skirt around it not being a tech news roundup.

321
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:07,888
Speaker 0: I just doing a bunch of news in the front One news limit.

322
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:11,836
Speaker 0: I see what you did there.

323
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,745
Speaker 0: All right, I'm gonna let you get away with that.

324
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:14,610
Speaker 1: All right, I'll do one more.

325
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:20,248
Speaker 1: I close my dad This one's short.

326
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:37,070
Speaker 1: I've been the slashdot tab a. So, you know how there are have been a ton of huge Ridiculous security breaches for the last few years like ruining people's lives destroying credit like mass chaos.

327
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:40,047
Speaker 1: You want to know the real reason why these keep happening?

328
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,528
Speaker 0: Because no one gives a shit.

329
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:55,820
Speaker 1: They well a lot of people give a shit but the only people who don't give a shit are the actual investors in these companies because studies show that the stock prices of Companies are completely unaffected by security problems full stop.

330
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:03,066
Speaker 1: Hmm, meaning there is literally no incentive to be secure Because it will not affect your bottom line in any meaningful way possibly.

331
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:08,246
Speaker 0: Hmm So we just need a law that says if you have a security breach you're out of business.

332
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:11,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get in Yep for the CEO and the board.

333
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:19,621
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

334
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:26,950
Speaker 1: I gotta tell you it's so exciting To have had a month-long hiatus from geek nights because I got like a hundred fucking things in the day queued up.

335
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,955
Speaker 0: I got some things a day.

336
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,343
Speaker 0: I'm gonna start off easy though.

337
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:30,650
Speaker 1: Alright, so this was a good one.

338
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,268
Speaker 1: What you think of the day?

339
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,173
Speaker 0: So this is just.

340
00:22:32,193 --> 00:22:36,031
Speaker 0: you know, there's a thing that you tend to do in real life without thinking too hard about it Right?

341
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:39,950
Speaker 0: is you know, you'll have some sort of object that makes a noise, right?

342
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,406
Speaker 0: even if it's just tapping something like a pencil or whatever and you tap a song.

343
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:47,379
Speaker 0: or you know Maybe you got like a squeaky toy.

344
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,650
Speaker 0: You'll squeak a song with your squeaky toy, right?

345
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:52,450
Speaker 0: You know, maybe you're throwing the ball to the dog or some share.

346
00:22:52,651 --> 00:23:00,857
Speaker 0: So here's somebody who got a Rubik's Cube which makes noise when you rotate it and They played a song while they rotated the Rubik's Cube.

347
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:04,748
Speaker 0: that song is El Cantina song from El Star Wars.

348
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:10,530
Speaker 0: pretty good and To make the video actually worth watching cuz like I could play the cantina song on a Rubik's Cube.

349
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:12,889
Speaker 0: Right, I could do that.

350
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:21,064
Speaker 0: they set the Rubik's Cube up in such a way that playing the song exactly once and So precisely results in a solved cube.

351
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:21,970
Speaker 0: good job.

352
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:33,310
Speaker 1: So you've probably seen a lot of movies especially classic movies where at the end There's a something something technicolor in the credits.

353
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:43,615
Speaker 1: Yep, you probably heard the word technicolor a lot in your life Especially if you watch if you want if you watched anything from the mid 20th century Yeah, like Wizard of Oz.

354
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:48,110
Speaker 0: You've seen the words technicolor in the opening and/or closing credits if it was in color.

355
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,429
Speaker 1: So Scott, what is technicolor?

356
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:54,270
Speaker 0: Isn't it like a certain kind of color film that they invented with certain cameras?

357
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:54,852
Speaker 1: It was.

358
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:59,468
Speaker 1: it wasn't a color film necessarily because their color existed long before technicolor.

359
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:09,977
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It was a process to be able to film things such that you could create a particular kind of color prints That was particularly vibrates.

360
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:13,908
Speaker 1: Okay, and particularly able to portray complex tones.

361
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:14,389
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

362
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,680
Speaker 0: And before they had better film,

363
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:32,945
Speaker 1: uh, yeah this video goes into very interesting depth as to why technicolor was important why the Wizard of Oz was important how they did it and the History of it and it's only like 10 minutes long Mm-hmm and it'll explain the deal of why technicolor was a big deal.

364
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:39,990
Speaker 1: compared to other color Technologies mostly other color technologies kind of sucks and even to early technicolor wasn't that great either.

365
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:55,310
Speaker 1: digital camera technicolor in a sense Allowed for an early form of what we now call color grading The ability for a. basically you could take a movie and give it a particular color aesthetic that could be different from other movies.

366
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:59,930
Speaker 1: Before technicolor pretty much any movie that came out in a given year just looked the way the film.

367
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,770
Speaker 1: Yeah They all looked the way the best film that was available in that year looks and you really couldn't do anything with it.

368
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:11,570
Speaker 1: And Wizard of Oz was not the first movie to use technicolor not even the best movie to use technicolor.

369
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:22,150
Speaker 1: It was the first movie to use technicolor For this kind of purpose and they went all out on doubling down on using technicolor to achieve a particular color aesthetic.

370
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,377
Speaker 1: Also, I learned some interesting things.

371
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:29,950
Speaker 1: remember when Dorothy walks out of her sepia tone house into the Wizard of Oz.

372
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:32,230
Speaker 1: That's not the actress.

373
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,990
Speaker 1: They have a different active actress who's wearing sepia colored clothes and is painted sepia color.

374
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:42,990
Speaker 1: And then when she goes out of frame the real actress walks in wearing normal clothes.

375
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:44,676
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

376
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:45,619
Speaker 1: This video is really good.

377
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:46,583
Speaker 0: Okay.

378
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:50,376
Speaker 1: So anyway in the meta moment We were at PAX unplugged.

379
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,840
Speaker 1: We were at magfest.

380
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:55,110
Speaker 0: We were at PAX South three daddy three convention.

381
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:58,664
Speaker 1: We were also up in Albany at a New Year's party and we were all.

382
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:01,634
Speaker 1: I was in Rochester Hanging out.

383
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:04,425
Speaker 1: We did a bunch of stuff saw some hockey games.

384
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:07,670
Speaker 1: I added a bunch of videos But we're finally back.

385
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,546
Speaker 1: So if you saw us at magfest, we're back in New York until PAX East.

386
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:12,389
Speaker 0: whenever the hell that is.

387
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,585
Speaker 1: Our panel from peck south is on YouTube right now.

388
00:26:15,686 --> 00:26:16,249
Speaker 1: You can watch it.

389
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,625
Speaker 1: So if you sat in line and then watch it at PAX, well good game.

390
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:21,749
Speaker 1: You could have just waited till now.

391
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:31,882
Speaker 0: yeah, if you see a discussion on the internet anywhere where people are arguing about a game being unbalanced or some character being Opie or Whatever it is post a link to that panel in that thread.

392
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:32,304
Speaker 0: Yep.

393
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,770
Speaker 0: That's why I made that panel for.

394
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,110
Speaker 0: So if at least one person does that then it'll be worth it.

395
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:48,131
Speaker 1: Also, if you saw us at pecks unplugged or you want to learn how to play Carcassonne the board game like the full We fully teach it and then we teach you how to be so good at it that no one else will ever play with You.

396
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:52,150
Speaker 1: again, that video is also on YouTube and it's already got a lot of views.

397
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:55,680
Speaker 1: I worry that we're gonna ruin the meta of bass Carcassonne.

398
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:03,218
Speaker 1: good the book club book is the Emily Wilson right Emily Wilson Translation of the Odyssey.

399
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:04,665
Speaker 0: Yep, as in I have it.

400
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:05,750
Speaker 0: I just haven't started read.

401
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,830
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start reading it real soon because I'm really excited about it.

402
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,276
Speaker 1: I've just been too busy to read lately.

403
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,124
Speaker 0: now that my apartments mostly clean.

404
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:18,350
Speaker 0: I think I can actually oh my god 100% of my laundry won't even fit in the drawers.

405
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:23,525
Speaker 0: I did all of it But I think I can now start being productive that you know all the things that are done.

406
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:35,050
Speaker 1: when I was in college or those Early days living in Beacon I'd go to a con or like do stuff and I'd leave the house Just in this like vague disarray and when I came home, the house was in the vague same state of disarray.

407
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:41,208
Speaker 1: somehow in my more adult life The mere act of traveling somewhere ruins my house.

408
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,909
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like a week to unruin it.

409
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:44,291
Speaker 1: well Cuz

410
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:49,876
Speaker 0: like I'll take my luggage and plop it on the floor and then I got buried in the laundry because I had to go To work right away,

411
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:55,365
Speaker 1: but also in the old days when I went to a con I brought like a shitty camcorder and some board games.

412
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:58,170
Speaker 1: the man I got like Tripods and all this equipment.

413
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:04,230
Speaker 0: The main thing is that when you're in college You only got to go to class for like a few hours and some days you got like Fridays off Mondays off.

414
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,040
Speaker 1: Also, I skipped class, right?

415
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,462
Speaker 0: It's like now.

416
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:09,390
Speaker 0: I got to go to work fucking eight hours a day.

417
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:11,586
Speaker 1: I can't and I can't just skip work.

418
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:15,261
Speaker 0: So like Reason the college days felt so good.

419
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:17,330
Speaker 0: We actually had free fucking time.

420
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,336
Speaker 1: We had a term for that.

421
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:22,548
Speaker 1: if you ever hear Scott and I like might occasionally say hey Scott Does one have one of those days?

422
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:32,690
Speaker 1: Those days were the specific days where we were at our IT and we just fucking stayed in our apartment and Sat on our couches basically didn't do anything.

423
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,849
Speaker 1: It was so rare even in college that we had those days.

424
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:38,740
Speaker 1: I don't think I'll ever have one of those days again the rest of my life.

425
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:45,930
Speaker 0: those particularly in that one summer summer Puerto Rico Because we were only you were like just working at DiBella's and I was only taking like two classes.

426
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,350
Speaker 1: I knew cuz we had the main couch that we usually sit on to like watch stuff.

427
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,757
Speaker 1: I knew it was one of those days.

428
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:55,737
Speaker 1: if anyone at any point sat on the loveseat Because there's no reason to sit over there.

429
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,605
Speaker 1: Normally there's nothing to do over there.

430
00:28:57,906 --> 00:29:00,587
Speaker 1: if I sat down over there It's cuz I had fucking nothing to do.

431
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:09,428
Speaker 1: But yeah follow us on YouTube where I got a bunch more panels from magfest that I'm uploading and I'm gonna release bit by bit over the next few weeks.

432
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:13,598
Speaker 1: and uh Judge anime by its cover.

433
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:15,406
Speaker 1: We actually did the next upcoming season.

434
00:29:15,446 --> 00:29:18,478
Speaker 1: We recorded it Recently and it's gonna be on YouTube.

435
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,644
Speaker 0: It's the current season.

436
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:20,950
Speaker 0: That's actually airing right now.

437
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,906
Speaker 0: We were delayed because of all those conventions.

438
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:26,516
Speaker 0: doesn't matter I'm gonna upload it.

439
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,286
Speaker 1: There were two or three anime that I think we're gonna watch.

440
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:30,330
Speaker 0: I knows one.

441
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,460
Speaker 0: I'm definitely gonna was one.

442
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,630
Speaker 1: I'm definitely gonna watch.

443
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:38,645
Speaker 1: So, yeah Scott's been bitching about his computer crashing.

444
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:39,429
Speaker 0: I have.

445
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:44,821
Speaker 0: So I've talked about this on the show before You know, it's sort of as the tale goes on.

446
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:50,930
Speaker 1: but and the tale is not yet over We're coming in in the middle of a story.

447
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:57,150
Speaker 0: But basically my desktop for some reason kind of unstably right something something going on with it.

448
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,410
Speaker 0: So at first it was just sort of like some blue screens here and there and then lots of blue screens pretty much leave the house.

449
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,068
Speaker 0: come home see blue screen is like well, it's not good.

450
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:11,087
Speaker 0: and The problem with those blue screens was that I couldn't figure out where the hell they came from.

451
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:12,537
Speaker 0: Ram test Checked out.

452
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:13,041
Speaker 0: Okay.

453
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:13,626
Speaker 0: All right.

454
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:21,088
Speaker 1: Yep Now let's contrast this with when my computer doing geek nights back in the day was getting crashy Like almost the exact same situation was going on.

455
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,224
Speaker 1: so I did the differential diagnosis like Scott is talking about.

456
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:30,905
Speaker 1: he was doing now like first I Had an extra power supply so I swapped him just to see if that made a difference and it didn't.

457
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:34,430
Speaker 1: so then I like Ran the RAM test and it tested fine.

458
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:39,347
Speaker 1: then I even took all the RAM sticks out and booted with just like one of them and it was fine.

459
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:44,023
Speaker 1: and then I pulled The video card and ran with the motherboard video and it was fine.

460
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,330
Speaker 1: Like everything I did it crashed at the same rate.

461
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:56,774
Speaker 1: Nothing was the cause until one day I plugged some headphones into the USB panel on the front of the computer and A spark happened.

462
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,707
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and the computer immediately blue-screened.

463
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,470
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm So I unply pulled it out.

464
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:09,170
Speaker 1: I go huh and I unplugged all the linkages between the case and the computer and then the blue screens never happened again.

465
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,860
Speaker 1: old shitty cases.

466
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:19,680
Speaker 1: if you have a crashy computer the first thing you want to check is those front USB panels because they're cheap and if you wiggle them even a little bit and Break them and start shortening.

467
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:20,609
Speaker 1: It's gonna crash your computer.

468
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:26,770
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I went to the windows like logs trying to look for what caused these blue screen.

469
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,508
Speaker 1: How the windows logs are the special breed of useless, right?

470
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,713
Speaker 0: So it's like all.

471
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:34,706
Speaker 0: the different blue screens had different messages like security this and kernel panic.

472
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:38,910
Speaker 0: that and this and you know They weren't descriptive at all to this day are always different.

473
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,670
Speaker 0: If I went to the windows logs, it would just be like yeah abnormal shut down.

474
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,610
Speaker 0: You shut down him without shutting down the computer just turned off and it didn't actually tell me fucking anything.

475
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:49,555
Speaker 1: I just did this.

476
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:54,981
Speaker 1: they don't understand why windows logs are so shitty Like I. like it ask a simple question.

477
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:55,162
Speaker 1: like.

478
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:57,250
Speaker 0: they have a log system that seems to work fine.

479
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,298
Speaker 0: It's just they don't actually log the right info.

480
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:05,745
Speaker 0: the events that get logged are usually this ridiculous I remember always like yeah, we put we sent a dump to some file.

481
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:06,850
Speaker 0: It's like no one can read that.

482
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,438
Speaker 1: No, even normal stuff tell me why this computer rebooted.

483
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:14,113
Speaker 1: windows is like Meanwhile Linux.

484
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:20,109
Speaker 1: if I show my mom like Linux logs she can kind of parse what happened because it says what happened.

485
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:23,079
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, so that was unhelpful.

486
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:26,210
Speaker 0: So one thing I tried is just replacing the motherboard.

487
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,846
Speaker 0: I'm like, well, it's sort of fritzy and it's probably the motherboard right.

488
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,995
Speaker 0: that makes sense Alright, so I replaced them.

489
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:40,311
Speaker 0: It was hard to get a compatible motherboard with the CPU because the socket is old and I. but I got one and It.

490
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:45,629
Speaker 0: first it seemed a lot better but then over time no back to its bad ways.

491
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:46,973
Speaker 1: now It's interesting.

492
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:50,063
Speaker 1: how did it's always hard to tell with this kind of situation.

493
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:52,130
Speaker 1: Was it really better or was it just your perception?

494
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

495
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:54,803
Speaker 1: I also were you keeping a log.

496
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,130
Speaker 0: there were some times I reasons.

497
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:05,010
Speaker 0: I think I don't know if at that time I reinstalled windows, but that also helped for a time and then Over eventually, but she didn't help when my computer was crashing.

498
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:08,470
Speaker 1: One thing I did is I had a pay up little notepad next to my desk.

499
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:14,919
Speaker 1: It was actually a moleskine a because I didn't really use it for anything and I logged The time and circumstance of every time the computer blue screen.

500
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:21,081
Speaker 0: when I was definitely bought me a period of time where there were no Crashes whatsoever and then they started up again, huh?

501
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:21,483
Speaker 0: Right.

502
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:23,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's actually fascinating.

503
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:36,750
Speaker 0: So then I realized I checked and some people on the internet were saying yo if you got some weird-ass hard drives Even it like SSDs, even if they're not like crashing they might be doing weird stuff and just causing crashes.

504
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,576
Speaker 0: So that is true.

505
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:48,083
Speaker 1: my Lenovo laptop the x230 it crashed a few times on me like years ago and One day I was on a business trip and suddenly the computer was fine.

506
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:48,705
Speaker 1: Like it crashed.

507
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:50,250
Speaker 1: I rebooted and everything seemed fine.

508
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,166
Speaker 1: I could not run notepad.

509
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:57,277
Speaker 1: Every time I ran notepad it would blue screen But everything else worked fine.

510
00:33:57,678 --> 00:33:57,839
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

511
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:06,743
Speaker 1: So then I went into Windows Event Viewer and it was logging like Hundreds of weird errors per second all over the place.

512
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:07,185
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

513
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:17,617
Speaker 1: Basically the SSD Was having some weird issues and was selectively corrupting like certain calls I guess was the best I could describe.

514
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:24,350
Speaker 1: so replacing the SSD a hundred percent resolved the crashes But it manifested as if you open notepad your computer blue screens.

515
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:30,868
Speaker 0: Anyway, so my computer has a ton of drives in it and I removed this this SSD in there.

516
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:31,650
Speaker 0: That's really old.

517
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,719
Speaker 0: It's only like 16 gigs.

518
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,324
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, it's real tiny.

519
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:35,888
Speaker 1: I got a 32 gig one.

520
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:36,712
Speaker 1: That's from.

521
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:40,030
Speaker 0: I might not be 16, but it might be 64.

522
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,251
Speaker 0: It's just.

523
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:47,837
Speaker 0: the point is it's a really tiny SSD, but it's still SSD and I was using it for like, you know Swapping but still an SSD.

524
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:54,790
Speaker 1: watch out because early gen SSDs are pretty shitty and they're in many cases They might actually be slower than a modern spin in this.

525
00:34:54,931 --> 00:34:58,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is I wasn't using it that much so I just took it.

526
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,293
Speaker 0: All I did was unplug it.

527
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:05,130
Speaker 0: that relieved crashing for like a few months and then the crashing came back again, huh?

528
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,191
Speaker 0: Right.

529
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:17,071
Speaker 1: Oh if it if that alone had relieved the crashing for a while I'd still think that there's a voltage problem either on that motherboard or that type of motherboard Like.

530
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,539
Speaker 1: maybe they wear out like some sort of voltage regulator.

531
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:21,384
Speaker 0: So my plan was like PSU.

532
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,530
Speaker 0: So now I'm like, well, it's 2018.

533
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,332
Speaker 0: This computer's in 2012, right?

534
00:35:24,352 --> 00:35:27,260
Speaker 0: I did, you know, it has a 680 which in 2012 was like a 1080 now, right?

535
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,631
Speaker 0: I bought basically top-of-the-line shit 32 gigs of RAM in 2012.

536
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:39,898
Speaker 0: So I was sort of like hoping it would last even more than the usual five years Right, and it's.

537
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:46,370
Speaker 0: I guess it's on six years now because it's 2018 But I still was would wish it would go to 2019 for all the money I spent on it, right?

538
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,821
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I want to do the same with mine.

539
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,010
Speaker 1: My computer is from 2009.

540
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:56,050
Speaker 0: I replaced it kinda recently, but I because it's been all crashy I've been like, well, you know, I'll just wait for the 1180s and get a new computer.

541
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,078
Speaker 0: But well, we'd already talked to the GPU bullshit.

542
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now there's also the Intel bullshit.

543
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:07,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not the best time to invest heavily in a top-of-the-line CPU until that shit gets sorted.

544
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,234
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Which could be a long time.

545
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:13,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if it's gonna be a long time, you're kind of forced to buy a new computer Right.

546
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:19,350
Speaker 0: Well also the thing is is like, okay So a new CPU still has this problem and is gonna take a performance hit right?

547
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,870
Speaker 0: Theoretically some future CPU will be re-architected and not have the problem and get the performance back.

548
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:35,790
Speaker 0: They said they're gonna fix this and CPUs going back right - I think they said has well But like my CPU came out like really really has well, they said I forget which one it was.

549
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,392
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

550
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:37,858
Speaker 1: They're not fucking fixing Nehalem.

551
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,484
Speaker 1: So I definitely had to upgrade that thing.

552
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:43,118
Speaker 0: I think mine is like Something bridge ivy bridge.

553
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:44,424
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what your mine is.

554
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:47,516
Speaker 0: I have to look it up again But the point is mine was Nehalem.

555
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:51,669
Speaker 0: I think mine's a three seven seven zero K. go type that in and see what it says.

556
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:56,089
Speaker 0: 377 K. three seven seven zero K. I think that's what I have.

557
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:58,175
Speaker 0: Is that what I have?

558
00:36:58,537 --> 00:36:59,724
Speaker 0: I think that's what I bridge.

559
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:09,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I got Right, and I don't think that one's gonna get fixed Even though that CPU is actually despite being for 2012 is Pretty great.

560
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:15,630
Speaker 0: Like it's still real fast and I won't notice, you know such a huge enormous improvement for a new CPU.

561
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:24,842
Speaker 0: There's actually a site I don't forget what the URL is and they basically group CPUs into categories and the category they group in is not necessarily like best.

562
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:29,239
Speaker 0: second best third best It's if you have a CPU in this grouping.

563
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:38,428
Speaker 0: all these other CPUs in this grouping is not really worth upgrading Unless you're gonna go to the next group and my CPU is still in the highest group with the current i7.

564
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:39,695
Speaker 0: Yep All right.

565
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:43,241
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine was a 2.66 gigahertz.

566
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway.

567
00:37:45,293 --> 00:37:48,388
Speaker 0: So I was like, you know, I guess I'll buy a new computer but it's like.

568
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:51,010
Speaker 0: well It's not a great time.

569
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:55,550
Speaker 0: You know 1180s not out yet the Intel CPU thing came in a really bad time.

570
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:58,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and the issue is unlike me.

571
00:37:58,304 --> 00:38:02,241
Speaker 1: you're having the crashing issue But performance you see mostly performance is perfectly fine.

572
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,505
Speaker 0: If I can make this computer work.

573
00:38:03,586 --> 00:38:04,730
Speaker 0: I would not need to upgrade.

574
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,098
Speaker 1: That's why my decision was easier.

575
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,970
Speaker 1: My performance was unacceptable.

576
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:18,052
Speaker 0: Yeah plus I think what I can do is I can take the 1070 out of my HD PC which doesn't need a 1070 and I was thinking I'll go buy like a 1060 for the HD PC.

577
00:38:18,334 --> 00:38:24,507
Speaker 0: now that I see the 1070 is unnecessary over there, but Can't even get a 1060 for cheap these days.

578
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:28,753
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, so I got new problem Which is that?

579
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:36,160
Speaker 0: what I've been doing is I've been really shutting the computer all the way down when I leave the house Which has been decreasing the crashing a little bit, right?

580
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,661
Speaker 1: Really?

581
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,469
Speaker 0: Yeah instead of just leaving it on all the time.

582
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:47,276
Speaker 0: But I got a new problem, which is that if I got headphones plugged in the front port Computer works just fine.

583
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:58,053
Speaker 0: If I don't have anything plugged in the front port I basically get these near somewhat close to constant very consistent messages like oh, we see you plugged headphones And no you didn't.

584
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,325
Speaker 0: we see, you know, we say headphones and no you didn't.

585
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:04,823
Speaker 1: Scott if you tried Disconnecting your motherboard from the case in its entirety.

586
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,450
Speaker 0: I'm gonna disconnect the front port.

587
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:12,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, disconnect the front port and all the all the case USBs But I need those you know, just use the back USBs.

588
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,683
Speaker 0: Oh, actually, I actually have a card a PCI Express card that has more.

589
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:27,270
Speaker 1: you I'm telling you try this get Disconnect your computer from anything that's built into the case and only use things that are built into the just gonna disconnect the front port Part and see if that stops the messages.

590
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:37,481
Speaker 0: Yeah but if it doesn't I would try fully fully removing the case from the other thing that I'm gonna try if this doesn't work is Buy the power supply that I would buy for a new computer.

591
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:38,846
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, cuz power supplies.

592
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:45,329
Speaker 1: It's not like a year from now There'll be a better power and put it in this computer Right and then see if that's fixes things.

593
00:39:46,393 --> 00:39:48,159
Speaker 0: My new computer and move the power supply.

594
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,290
Speaker 1: you could just use a voltimeter and like test your power supply.

595
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,464
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, but it's pain in the ass.

596
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:53,907
Speaker 1: Yeah.

597
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,200
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I don't know what's gonna be with this computer.

598
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,616
Speaker 0: if there wasn't all these problems with the CPUs and GPUs I could just buy a new computer.

599
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:06,129
Speaker 1: now actually why you could get why don't you run it entirely outside of your case?

600
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,661
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass and I have a lot of room my apartment.

601
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:13,761
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but if there just be a test Yeah, how long I got to leave it out there?

602
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:14,284
Speaker 1: I don't know.

603
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:14,887
Speaker 1: a month or two.

604
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:16,535
Speaker 1: Yeah Keep dusting it.

605
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:17,117
Speaker 0: Sure.

606
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:26,634
Speaker 1: It's just always interesting when you run into the situation of Don't want to upgrade because you have a play you can get like we always talk about like buy the best of a thing or The cheapest thing.

607
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:28,484
Speaker 0: so I bought the best thing.

608
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:32,637
Speaker 0: usually I'll buy Computers that were one step below the best.

609
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:47,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's value and they would last five years, but five years ago I bought a computer that was top-of-the-line kick-ass computer because the pricing was really great right then and I wanted to last more than five years and because of this crashing issue is might not make it.

610
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been wish I was going next time.

611
00:40:50,061 --> 00:40:51,627
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy a top-of-the-line.

612
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:52,270
Speaker 0: I learned my lesson.

613
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:59,561
Speaker 1: I've been going on a seven to eight year cycle, but that's because I buy a Even bigger computer when I buy them.

614
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:01,910
Speaker 0: Well, this was the even bigger computer.

615
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:08,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's my computer now is pretty fucking nuts And I feel like it's gonna be a decade before I have to buy another one.

616
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:08,934
Speaker 0: Anyway,

617
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:20,638
Speaker 1: but the problem is with that scenario, you know The the plan of like buying at the plateau every time is that if there's a problem then you have to make a really hard decision like when we

618
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:25,846
Speaker 0: were at our IT, I mean you buy a Toyota and it crashes you buy a Ferrari and it crashes.

619
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:26,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

620
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:35,370
Speaker 1: But when I was at our IT Remember I bought the my top-of-the-line computer when I came to our IT that I spent Basically all the bonds my grandparents had bought for my entire life.

621
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:44,967
Speaker 0: I spent all of them to buy a computer right if you take it for if you buy a Ferrari and it lasts you five Times as long as a $20,000 car then actually that doesn't.

622
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:45,650
Speaker 0: it's not ridiculous?

623
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,826
Speaker 0: Yes, well the parable of but if it lasts is just as long as a $20,000 car.

624
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:56,378
Speaker 1: It's like well fuck the old parable of a poor person spends a lot more money on boots over time than a rich person Because they buy shitty boots.

625
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:58,349
Speaker 1: Yep, because they can't afford the good boots once.

626
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:05,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when I came to our IT I had spent a ton of money on an Athlon K7.

627
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:06,342
Speaker 0: Oh, baby.

628
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:09,553
Speaker 0: I had me some of those 800 megahertz.

629
00:42:09,854 --> 00:42:16,577
Speaker 1: I think I had some of those that were gigahertz sock or slot a And that that computer was a dream.

630
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:21,134
Speaker 1: The problem was the motherboard exploded because the capacitor issue We had.

631
00:42:21,757 --> 00:42:24,330
Speaker 0: that was the era where I felt like we made too many computers.

632
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:26,150
Speaker 0: That was where we didn't get our five years worth.

633
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:31,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Athlons were just so shitty exploding all the time and the CPUs were always fine.

634
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,677
Speaker 1: It was just like the motherboards.

635
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,910
Speaker 0: never there were so many other so many problems with them.

636
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:39,116
Speaker 0: They made all this trouble and then as soon as we got that Pentium It was worth it.

637
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:40,683
Speaker 0: We got back on the Intel train.

638
00:42:40,763 --> 00:42:41,567
Speaker 0: Everything was good to go.

639
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:45,404
Speaker 1: Per dollar They were so much faster than an equivalent Intel.

640
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:46,690
Speaker 0: Yeah in those days.

641
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, because your choice is a Pentium 4 which is like.

642
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:51,930
Speaker 1: but when it exploded the problem was I didn't have a lot of money.

643
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:56,950
Speaker 1: I needed a computer to be at our IT like I was effed without that computer.

644
00:42:57,652 --> 00:43:15,310
Speaker 1: My options were to buy a new motherboard to keep using the k7 800 that I already bought or spend only a little bit more money to buy a Modern Thunderbird gigahertz motherboard, but then I had to buy a new CPU.

645
00:43:16,473 --> 00:43:21,364
Speaker 1: I ended up forgetting my dad to send me enough money to buy the Thunderbird gigahertz.

646
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:27,515
Speaker 1: that extra 200 megahertz was actually a big deal And but it was a hard decision like I do.

647
00:43:27,575 --> 00:43:29,860
Speaker 1: it was a very difficult choice to make mm-hmm.

648
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:31,940
Speaker 1: So you're just gonna keep you get.

649
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:32,485
Speaker 1: I guess you're.

650
00:43:32,707 --> 00:43:33,090
Speaker 1: what are you gonna?

651
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:33,391
Speaker 1: Do?

652
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:35,580
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try unplug in the front port when I get home.

653
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,310
Speaker 0: So had time to do until now and then see where we go from there.

654
00:43:39,811 --> 00:43:45,187
Speaker 1: I would I would bet that unplugging the front port and possibly also unplugging the case USBs.

655
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:45,689
Speaker 1: We'll fix it.

656
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:46,110
Speaker 0: We'll see.

657
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:46,974
Speaker 1: That's my guess.

658
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:50,730
Speaker 1: I would bet I would bet a small amount of money that that will fix it.

659
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:52,279
Speaker 1: I'll bet you a dollar.

660
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:56,463
Speaker 0: No no I'm just gonna unplug that front for it.

661
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:58,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

662
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:02,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're back and Starting Wednesday.

663
00:44:02,394 --> 00:44:05,263
Speaker 1: We're gonna review Mary and the witch's flower because we saw it in the theater.

664
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:11,086
Speaker 1: That's why we didn't do a show actually after we got back from PAX because we wouldn't saw that instead.

665
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,080
Speaker 1: yeah, and Then we got regular shows as usual.

666
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:14,844
Speaker 1: stay tuned.

667
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:15,830
Speaker 1: We're back on our bullshit.

Speaker 1: if you have noticed that I haven't been saying your name and you expected me to Check and see if you perhaps checked an option that says basically I don't want the reward for this tier because Several people have checked that option over time and I'm wondering if perhaps that is not intentional.

683
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:12,701
Speaker 1: But anyway, as you could surmise we're back.

Speaker 1: presents you Tana.

686
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:17,690
Speaker 1: Don't worry We just had to get a bunch of other stuff out of our queue first.

687
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,425
Speaker 1: But I literally am doing some pre-production will probably have it up before the end of February.

688
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:23,970
Speaker 1: things are coming along.

689
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:25,378
Speaker 1: We did a judge anime.

690
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,250
Speaker 1: I got a bunch of panel videos.

691
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:35,195
Speaker 1: I'm gonna restart the Q&A with a much easier format and I'm gonna let pretty much everyone who's a patron Ask the questions.

692
00:46:35,236 --> 00:46:37,327
Speaker 1: I'm gonna change that because I really just want $1 patrons.

693

Speaker 1: Everything's back.

695
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:42,366
Speaker 1: Everything's good.

696
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:43,270
Speaker 1: working on our convention.

697
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:50,930
Speaker 1: The next convention will be at will be PAX East followed by Zenk icon and then I think it's just straight from there to PAX Prime.

698
00:46:51,635 --> 00:46:53,809
Speaker 1: But now I leave you with.
