1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,812
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 26th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:16,421
Speaker 0: We bring you our coverage of ToraCon 2006.

3
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:18,804
Speaker 1: Let's do this Today work.

4
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:27,077
Speaker 1: I was setting up all the you know stuff on my fresh work windows crap Laptop thing I send.

5
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:34,569
Speaker 0: sometimes I like doing that because it means my computer is going to be not bogged down by all the crap that I'm about to put On it, but at the same time.

6
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:35,855
Speaker 0: I hate doing that.

7
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:46,400
Speaker 1: yeah Surprisingly I had to reboot only like four or five times to do all the windows updates Oh, and I had to add two or three times to do the office updates.

8
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,591
Speaker 1: Anyway, one of the things I had to do is update iTunes now.

9
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:56,312
Speaker 1: I originally thought hey look at this You know all I really do with iTunes is podcast.

10
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:59,842
Speaker 1: I'll save my opml and It's okay.

11
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:04,959
Speaker 1: if I delete all the mp3s off my hard drive because they're on my iPod - they all get redown loaded.

12
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,914
Speaker 1: No no no, so I'm like all right.

13
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:19,379
Speaker 1: You know and then when I Import my opml and then get my podcast list back It'll just get all the mp3s from my iPod and reload the whole thing.

14
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,307
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't quite work that way.

15
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:23,269
Speaker 0: What happened?

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,920
Speaker 1: well first of all it didn't let me import the opml like I couldn't.

17
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,664
Speaker 1: I went to import.

18
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,051
Speaker 1: I chose the opml file.

19
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,660
Speaker 1: I clicked ok nothing happened.

20
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,540
Speaker 0: Did you try getting some other opml and importing it just to make sure it wasn't yours?

21
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,274
Speaker 1: This is opml that I had exported from iTunes.

22
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:42,307
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but just in case I mean I would have taken someone else's and just ride.

23
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:48,685
Speaker 1: I don't even think about that, but no it wasn't importing opml, so I Manually added all the.

24
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:55,271
Speaker 1: well that's the other part of the story, but I manually added podcast to the feed And then I plugged in the iPod.

25
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:56,399
Speaker 1: What did it do?

26
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:04,340
Speaker 1: It didn't take the You know mp3s off my iPod and match them to the feeds to which I was subscribed.

27
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:10,280
Speaker 1: No, it took the feeds to which I was subscribed and overwrote everything on my on my podcast on my iPod.

28
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,091
Speaker 1: So I lost a whole bunch of stuff.

29
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:18,365
Speaker 1: I could go redown load it, but anyway Yeah, iTunes isn't so great.

30
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:19,227
Speaker 1: No.

31
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:23,820
Speaker 1: It's it's not really straight like in in its goal to be really simple.

32
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,580
Speaker 1: It makes it really difficult to do.

33
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:36,440
Speaker 1: To get it to do exactly what you want it to do You know because it's really only designed to work if you use it in one specific way.

34
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,296
Speaker 1: So if you try to make it do anything else it just fucks you.

35
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:48,024
Speaker 0: well I'm sure I'll be running a follow of all that since now that it really looks like I'm gonna pick one of these jobs I've been offered for the past month and At that point.

36
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:58,079
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna buy it on a spending spring by an iPod gonna buy an i-trip Maybe a motorcycle yeah, I think we should just have one Apple computer to manage all this shit.

37
00:02:58,986 --> 00:02:59,692
Speaker 0: That'd be kind of nice.

38
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,999
Speaker 1: I gotta say yeah We should have one Apple computer one Windows computer and all the other computers can be Linux.

39
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:07,800
Speaker 0: I'm thinking to turn in my current computer when I get the new one into our Windows computer.

40
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:12,497
Speaker 0: Maybe I mean or you could turn your computer, which is significantly faster than mine into that.

41
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,019
Speaker 1: We'll see.

42
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,093
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is is that because I had to manually read all these podcasts.

43
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:30,314
Speaker 1: I ended up dropping a whole bunch You know because they just weren't worth adding again, or like there are a couple of them like that's harsh I mean how bad you have to be to where you were only listening out of habit.

44
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:33,847
Speaker 1: and now that it's no no no like I wasn't even listening like NPR story of the day.

45
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:37,959
Speaker 1: right NPR stories of the day range from like five minutes to like 20 minutes.

46
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:38,654
Speaker 1: Right yeah.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Speaker 1: So I just kind of collected them and I would listen to them if I ran out of everything else that I had.

48
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,540
Speaker 1: But I ended up not listening to them and just downloading like a bajillion episode.

49
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,350
Speaker 1: So I just didn't read that.

50
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:51,879
Speaker 1: it just wasn't worth my time.

51
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:55,896
Speaker 0: You think you'd get to all that with an hour drive each way home to and from work.

52
00:03:56,097 --> 00:04:05,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other one That's pretty sad is is IT conversations, which has all the recordings of people speaking at different Conferences around the world and all that stuff.

53
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:10,823
Speaker 1: and you know that's a feed where you really don't want to download anything in there Automatically.

54
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:15,102
Speaker 1: you just want to look through and see what comes and download very specific Episodes.

55
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 1: and I had about like 20 of those things that I hadn't had time to listen to yet that are kind of wanted to.

56
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:24,993
Speaker 1: but Again, it just wasn't worth it to read that feed and go through it.

57
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,980
Speaker 1: So I tried to add like Like.

58
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:31,811
Speaker 1: they have separate feeds on IT conversations or different categories.

59
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:34,559
Speaker 1: So I was like, okay, I'll just add the programming one.

60
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:38,819
Speaker 1: The programming one hasn't had a new item in it in like a year.

61
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,289
Speaker 1: Great it was totally not useful at all.

62
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,916
Speaker 0: I'm really looking forward to dealing with all that.

63
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:51,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, but In addition, I added a whole bunch of new podcasts and what's kind of scary is like.

64
00:04:52,036 --> 00:05:08,686
Speaker 1: I have one anime podcast Which anime world order I added like three gaming podcasts to make up for the loss of gamers with jobs and we'll see which of them survive past, you know one episode and And You know, I have one.

65
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,900
Speaker 1: I have pretty much one podcast for every geekery.

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,772
Speaker 1: I have a board game podcast a comic book podcast, whatever right see.

67
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,200
Speaker 0: now wouldn't it be nice to consolidate all those into one?

68
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:18,530
Speaker 1: You know and listen to geek nights.

69
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,792
Speaker 1: Yeah.

70
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:23,514
Speaker 1: Yeah You've already done that but I have geek nights on everyone.

71
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:33,667
Speaker 0: I need to listen to that for You know surprisingly we've been doing this so often and so long that it's got to the point to where after about a week I'll remember the topics I talk about.

72
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,597
Speaker 0: but when I listen to myself, I don't remember saying half the things.

73
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:49,071
Speaker 1: I say no I'm not gonna remember saying this but the What scares me a lot is that I have three sports podcasts after what I did today Three three I have I have every day.

74
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:59,777
Speaker 1: I really actually discovered two of them today Because if I had television right like which I don't the things I would watch would be like f1 races Cartoons.

75
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:07,420
Speaker 0: I'd watch The Daily Show probably The Daily Show maybe Sports Center, maybe I'd watch occasional hockey games.

76
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,920
Speaker 0: Yeah hockey only important hockey games cuz unless I'm at a hockey arena hockey's not that fun unless it's really a big game.

77
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,948
Speaker 1: See if I had HD TV I'd watch a lot more hockey than that cuz.

78
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,880
Speaker 1: hockey like the enjoyment of hockey and HD is like doubled.

79
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:23,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, if HD had anything going for it other than sports.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,660
Speaker 1: But and I'd probably watch that show on ESPN with the two guys arguing right which is like the best sports news show.

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,382
Speaker 1: There is that.

82
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:40,932
Speaker 1: the thing is I just got a podcast of the ESPN show with the two guys arguing Wait, isn't that the show that we originally considered using as the basis?

83
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,840
Speaker 1: that was that was my idea.

84
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:51,117
Speaker 1: Yeah that we can make a show and be like those two guys only do geek topics instead of sports topics Of course, that didn't work out, but whatever.

85
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:55,320
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, we never really tried it because we settled into the format we're using now pretty quickly.

86
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we could do a Thursday like that once or twice.

87
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,340
Speaker 1: maybe it's you need a whole bunch of news items.

88
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,620
Speaker 1: You need to do them really quickly and we always need to be on opposing viewpoints and all of them.

89
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:07,117
Speaker 0: Um, that's not that hard with us.

90
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,048
Speaker 0: Let's go down far and we need it.

91
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,435
Speaker 1: We need to use the sand timers.

92
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:18,100
Speaker 1: We got sand timers I know yeah, but then I got that there was a Sports Center podcast, which is like 10 minutes a day.

93
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:25,715
Speaker 1: You get Sports Center, which is like whoo, of course I probably might unsubscribe from that pretty quickly because the best part about Sports Center is like.

94
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,280
Speaker 1: you don't watch every sport.

95
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:35,719
Speaker 1: You maybe watch like your one team But especially during baseball season you watch Sports Center and you see like the amazing plays from every sport.

96
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean baseball is to me a really boring sport to watch.

97
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,620
Speaker 0: However, occasionally awesome things happen.

98
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,615
Speaker 1: It's not just baseball is there even basketball which I really don't.

99
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,580
Speaker 0: I don't like basketball

100
00:07:46,700 --> 00:08:00,656
Speaker 1: But you watch Sports Center like for an hour in the morning before you go to school or work or whatever on TV And that was the best because you would just see Amazing plays from every single sport of the previous day in the United States.

101
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:03,828
Speaker 0: What works pretty well is just Searching on Google video.

102
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:07,344
Speaker 0: Yeah hockey fight Soccer goalie.

103
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:19,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but eventually you run out of those, you know, this is like, you know The best of the best of yesterday and it's always pretty good, you know Like it's some guy in the Kansas City Royals makes like an amazing dive throw thing.

104
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,980
Speaker 1: You're not gonna freaking know about it without no one watches the Kansas City Royals that people in Kansas City don't know.

105
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,347
Speaker 0: There's two pairs two pairs two pairs.

106
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:33,166
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if there's an amazing play Sports Center, you know, you get that It's pretty good entertainment.

107
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:36,198
Speaker 1: I don't think there's a better morning TV show in this country.

108
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,972
Speaker 0: See to me that could definitely be the future of television.

109
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:44,120
Speaker 0: if good shows like that We're just video casts that I could watch at my leisure with no ads and no money.

110
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:55,500
Speaker 1: Yeah if like I won't pay 40 bucks a month to get cable to watch Sports Center every morning and have to wake up at a certain time to watch it But if I can download every Sports Center

111
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,320
Speaker 0: I don't know how easy it would be to do that show if it weren't for the copyright restrictions.

112
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:10,504
Speaker 0: All you'd have to do is be a sports geek watch all the sports on TV Maybe have a table them all and then go to it pull out all the plays put them on a thing at the end and talk about sports every day or

113
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:13,956
Speaker 1: even better just have one guy and what.

114
00:09:14,057 --> 00:09:21,760
Speaker 1: he has a bunch of Agents around the country so he gets a fan of every single team and they're gonna watch the game.

115
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:29,102
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah They edit out all the best plays and send it to this guy and then he pays them all together and then he talks over It.

116
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:35,840
Speaker 1: and there you have it Something that's not quite as quality as Sports Center but provides the same entertainment in the same content.

117
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:41,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, and anyone who would say that no one would do that for free Look at all the podcasts.

118
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:42,053
Speaker 0: We're all doing it.

119
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,140
Speaker 1: We'll do it for free.

120
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,440
Speaker 1: The problem is that stupid Major League Baseball spy satellite with their expressed written consent instead of the implied verbal consent.

121
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:52,690
Speaker 0: We just need some focus in.

122
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:53,394
Speaker 1: Yeah.

123
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:56,264
Speaker 0: All right Let's actually get to the news.

124
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:56,946
Speaker 1: All right.

125
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:06,656
Speaker 0: now since it's anime day and we've got our coverage of torque on 2006 coming up I would like to say that Otacon has released a minor little press thing.

126
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:17,913
Speaker 0: That's kind of a warning that Considering the nature of it I think it's a good idea to tell all of you about it since I've realized that most people who go to Otacon have never Actually seen the Otacon website and don't bother following the forums.

127
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,620
Speaker 1: How else can you find out about Otacon?

128
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,619
Speaker 1: There's no other way.

129
00:10:21,175 --> 00:10:24,640
Speaker 0: Yeah But people word of mouth people just hear about it and then decide to go with a friend.

130
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:29,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people apparently don't go to the Otacon website or at least don't go regularly.

131
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,787
Speaker 0: They go like once to see what the dates are.

132
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,987
Speaker 1: if you're listening to this and we have somehow convinced you to Otacon or if You have a plan to go to Otacon.

133
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,172
Speaker 1: You've never been before.

134
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:39,417
Speaker 1: maybe you have been before.

135
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:40,843
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter You need.

136
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,656
Speaker 1: if you're going to Otacon you must visit its website.

137
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,830
Speaker 1: if you don't have a computer I don't know how the hell you listen to this.

138
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,859
Speaker 1: but go to the library.

139
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,391
Speaker 1: Go to the library and visit the Otacon website.

140
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,716
Speaker 1: It is mandatory to visit.

141
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,559
Speaker 0: You know what you go.

142
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,271
Speaker 0: No No, it's not mandatory anymore since they finally implemented the RSS feed.

143
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still pretty mandatory.

144
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:21,050
Speaker 0: Well, at least follow the RSS because there is a announcement on it that apparently some fairly unscrupulous travel agency Types have been offering magic Otacon packages that may or may not include privileges at the con membership badges preference in lines and Otacon has come out to say that they haven't sponsored anything.

145
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:33,304
Speaker 0: and no one no one No one has the right to offer Otacon badges or any Otacon privileges or use the name Otacon in any way Except Otacon.

146
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:39,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if anyone says offers you like hey for a hundred bucks We'll get you a badge at a hotel room and blah.

147
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:44,382
Speaker 0: They're lying Scammers Ahoy.

148
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:49,820
Speaker 0: now at the same time there are a lot of fan groups that put together like chartered bus it buses from certain cities.

149
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,471
Speaker 0: I know there's one leaving New York City.

150
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:59,720
Speaker 0: Whoo, and Some people get together like hotel collectives where they get a bunch of people Strangers in and all sorts of fun things like that and that's cool.

151
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:07,717
Speaker 0: And some travel agencies are offering like Otacon travel packages But the moment they say that they're doing anything involving Otacon itself.

152
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:08,178
Speaker 0: They're lying.

153
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:14,254
Speaker 1: Yeah kind of makes you wonder about some of those package deals for other places like.

154
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:21,440
Speaker 1: I know this you the down is always down At Disney World as a bunch of packages you can buy but most some of those are legitimate at least most of them.

155
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:26,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, well even the ones that are legitimate they're usually not in any way affiliated with Disney World.

156
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:27,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's the same thing.

157
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:31,057
Speaker 0: There is no such thing as any affiliated package for Otacon.

158
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:34,491
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm There are packages for Otacon but Otacon has nothing to do with them.

159
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:35,675
Speaker 0: They don't endorse them.

160
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,820
Speaker 0: They don't promote them.

161
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,838
Speaker 0: They have nothing to do at all.

162
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:43,480
Speaker 1: You know, this really makes me wonder like I never really understood the point of the travel agent.

163
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:54,037
Speaker 1: I mean if I want to go somewhere in a trip, right if it's somewhere in this hemisphere The only person I need to help me is triple-a and even then I could probably do without.

164
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:54,880
Speaker 0: in the very least.

165
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,474
Speaker 0: Orbits plus map quest equals gold.

166
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:06,600
Speaker 1: I know right And maybe just maybe I'll have to go get one of those books From the bookstore that tells you about the place and what you should not miss when you go there.

167
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, that only be for a big trip.

168
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:10,780
Speaker 0: Like if we were going out to like the west coast for a week.

169
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:11,843
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

170
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:15,395
Speaker 1: But if you're going to like a foreign country, right?

171
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,871
Speaker 1: I need the book But I don't need a travel agent.

172
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:24,959
Speaker 1: all I really need is Maybe like a tour guide or a translator or something like that, you know.

173
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:34,100
Speaker 0: Well, it seems that most travel agencies offer deals Like they'll get a bulk rate for something and then they try to sell all the spots on the bulk rate.

174
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:38,639
Speaker 0: So if you go with one of their spots, you couldn't negotiate that bulk rate on your own.

175
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,746
Speaker 0: But they could because they have a lot of clients.

176
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then you're stuck in a bulk rate thing.

177
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:49,819
Speaker 1: Yes That's the thing I'm talking about is like why would you ever want to go on a trip that like someone else?

178
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:59,711
Speaker 0: Set up for you now at the same time some good travel agents I've seen because I was looking around I mean we're because we're thinking you know Both of us going somewhere weird next summer.

179
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,300
Speaker 0: I'm like a vacation somewhere awesome.

180
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:07,180
Speaker 0: Well, there are a lot of travel agents that work locally in an area like say you want to go to France.

181
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,599
Speaker 0: I'll just use France as an example.

182
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:14,419
Speaker 0: You can go through a normal travel agent or just call a hotel and stay at a Marriott and eat dinner it.

183
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,989
Speaker 0: you know Hard-rock cafe and all the stuff that's here.

184
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,411
Speaker 1: We can.

185
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,420
Speaker 1: I'm sure that on our own we could find a better hotel in France.

186
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,706
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah hotel but and eat at a better place.

187
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:37,037
Speaker 0: you could find a travel agent or at least someone out there who will help you who could Get you in touch with say the youth hostel or the chateau that lets like Tourists or boarders stay with them for a week or the cool ways to get around

188
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:37,760
Speaker 1: a bale of hay.

189
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:42,557
Speaker 0: Charlie Brown, is that what you're thinking about The Simpsons?

190
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,437
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah season what one two one yeah episode like two or three.

191
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,159
Speaker 0: That's way back.

192
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,080
Speaker 0: I barely remember that it was real early.

193
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:03,167
Speaker 0: I was thinking about the Charlie Brown where he went to France and he was mistreated and left in the barn Just like The Simpsons where Bart went to France and he was mistreated and left in a barn Yeah, and forced to drink antifreeze.

194
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,495
Speaker 0: Charlie Brown was he didn't drink the antifreeze.

195
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, they tried to make him drink it.

196
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:09,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, Charlie Brown didn't have to drink any antifreeze.

197
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:13,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what you get for wearing a zigzag II shirt.

198
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:15,885
Speaker 1: That made no sense.

199
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:16,608
Speaker 0: All right.

200
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,194
Speaker 0: All right, what's your news?

201
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:29,277
Speaker 0: Oh, so Katsuhiro Otomo who is perhaps the second or third Partially, well, you don't want to get yelled at by animal world order.

202
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:29,960
Speaker 0: Do you know?

203
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,673
Speaker 1: okay, Miyazaki is like the king of anime especially anime movies and Tezuka the astro boy guy.

204
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,800
Speaker 1: he's the king of manga.

205
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:45,460
Speaker 1: Otomo is like Next in line after those guys cuz he's kind of manga and anime both.

206
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,810
Speaker 0: Well, I'm really curious what anime world order is gonna have to say about that.

207
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,058
Speaker 1: He made freaking Akira.

208
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,591
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I don't disagree at all.

209
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:58,549
Speaker 1: steam boy and memories Come on.

210
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:03,785
Speaker 1: All right anyway Cup noodle Freedom.

211
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,826
Speaker 1: yeah cup noodle and Freedom this.

212
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:11,220
Speaker 1: this could have been a thing of the day, but I think it's news cuz it's anime day.

213
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,559
Speaker 0: I just this is something I really don't get.

214
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:18,180
Speaker 1: So cup noodle needed a commercial to sell cup noodle to Japanese people.

215
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:28,184
Speaker 1: They got Otomo one of the greatest anime makers of all time to make the commercial for them and their Campaign.

216
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:31,000
Speaker 1: their their marketing campaign slogan is freedom.

217
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,269
Speaker 1: What does cup noodle have to do with freedom?

218
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,213
Speaker 1: I don't know.

219
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:37,303
Speaker 1: ask a ramenite but What that?

220
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:44,185
Speaker 1: okay, they pay this guy a lot of money and they got Utada Hikaru to sing a song Over the commercial.

221
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,309
Speaker 1: what the hell?

222
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,232
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

223
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:47,236
Speaker 0: You know what?

224
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaker 0: I don't even like cup noodle.

225
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,147
Speaker 1: I don't like cup noodle either.

226
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:54,803
Speaker 0: I get I gotta go with a bowl noodle or at least the Sapporo Ichiban.

227
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the.

228
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,716
Speaker 0: I personally like the kitsune with a bean curd.

229
00:16:58,736 --> 00:16:59,680
Speaker 0: That's my favorite ramen.

230
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:10,458
Speaker 1: But still what's up with the Really expensive commercial of a freaking noodles that are more American than Japanese cup noodle.

231
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:18,196
Speaker 1: Yeah Japanese people get better noodles than that and like any street corner And you make yeah, all right.

232
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't get but watch the commercial.

233
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,164
Speaker 1: it's it's entertaining because it's made by a master of anime.

234
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:32,461
Speaker 1: Oh Do we have some good things of the day today?

235
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't even have to try this time.

236
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,078
Speaker 1: You might have seen some of them though, but that's okay.

237
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,665
Speaker 0: All right, so we've talked up V for Vendetta.

238
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:41,230
Speaker 0: It's a fantastic movie.

239
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,374
Speaker 0: It's a fantastic comic.

240
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,718
Speaker 0: I was very impressed with it.

241
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,250
Speaker 0: I have found a trailer to a movie that you might like even more.

242
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:49,230
Speaker 0: C for cookie.

243
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:53,279
Speaker 1: C is so cookie is good enough for me.

244
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,204
Speaker 0: It's someone made this.

245
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,210
Speaker 0: it kind of doesn't sync up with the audio.

246
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,432
Speaker 0: I thought it was my player but it really doesn't because they just took clips from Sesame Street and put them in to V for Vendetta.

247
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:12,148
Speaker 0: yeah, and then they put voices over it, but the voices are top-notch and I think the best part is when the count is like two last chances.

248
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:16,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, the count voice was in fact the worst voice though.

249
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:19,280
Speaker 1: It didn't sound like the count so much Yeah, but it had the spirit of the count.

250
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's what counts.

251
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,649
Speaker 0: That was not intentional, all right, here's a nice question for all of you out there.

252
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:28,438
Speaker 0: One watch this trailer.

253
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:29,503
Speaker 0: It's really well done and cool.

254
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:30,790
Speaker 1: It's a already trailers.

255
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,442
Speaker 0: In fact it's probably better than Titanic to the surface.

256
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:37,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one wasn't that impressive.

257
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,599
Speaker 0: well That's because you haven't seen Titanic.

258
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:41,310
Speaker 1: don't really care about Titanic.

259
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,236
Speaker 1: I'm never gonna see it.

260
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:51,530
Speaker 0: if someone out there can find us a video of The batty bat the batty bat batty bat batty batty batty batty batty batty one two three count.

261
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

262
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,041
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know Betty bet well.

263
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,450
Speaker 0: We actually will give some sort of prize because we can't find it.

264
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:05,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I tried to search on YouTube and Google video for a video of The batty bat the original Sesame Street batty bat, and I couldn't find it at home.

265
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:10,970
Speaker 1: I actually have a VHS tape that like this my sisters and my brothers, and they were little.

266
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:16,430
Speaker 1: It's like a Sesame Street dance tape or something and it shows you how to dance the batty bat using.

267
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,890
Speaker 1: So I could get that and dance the batty bat.

268
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,162
Speaker 1: But I don't think I don't have the original batty bat.

269
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:29,710
Speaker 1: with the bats that are hanging from the ceiling accounts little room with his organ.

270
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:34,386
Speaker 1: You know moving the little wing-a-lings back and forth and spinning around and you know singing.

271
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want that video All right, yeah now really We'll give you something.

272
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:42,795
Speaker 0: because I know a lot of times we say oh if you give us something and we trail off no We'll give you something.

273
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:44,587
Speaker 0: I don't know what it'll be one day.

274
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:45,351
Speaker 1: what we're gonna Do?

275
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:46,877

Speaker 1: Oh Tits go go.

280
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:07,525

281
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:12,242
Speaker 1: that costs money like t-shirts And then we'll get free shit merch like stickers.

00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:13,707

283
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:17,130
Speaker 1: It'll just be a sticker Yeah, or something else cheap like a keychain.

284
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,530
Speaker 0: And I remember just now that someone did answer one of our previous questions in the forum and I forget who it was.

285
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:31,669
Speaker 1: But the next time I remember it I'll say something on the air cuz tomorrow I'll go through our emails in the forum finding all the people who are on the list and I'll make a list.

286
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:38,370
Speaker 1: And then what we'll do is when the time comes and we get merch I'll send everyone.

287
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,870
Speaker 1: I'll send an email to everyone a list or a forum message to everyone on the list and then I'll send you a sticker.

288
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,540
Speaker 1: Or if I see you in person, I'll give you something.

289
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, come to Otacon and you'll see us.

290
00:20:48,989 --> 00:20:57,741
Speaker 1: Yep All right, so my thing of the day you might have seen this already because it's pretty popular It's a secret Wars reenactment video.

291
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,027
Speaker 1: It's it's basically parodying two things.

292
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:04,784
Speaker 1: Well three things It's parodying stupid comic fans all things all things.

293
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,190
Speaker 1: It's Monty Python day.

294
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:11,830
Speaker 1: It's parodying three things nerdy comic fans.

295
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:18,626
Speaker 1: So Marvel secret wars and those people who reenact the Civil War.

296
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:22,176
Speaker 0: those people are cool But they're also scary like SCA people.

297
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:22,958
Speaker 1: cool yet.

298
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:23,499
Speaker 1: Scary.

299
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,775
Speaker 0: I watched a reenactment of a battle from the Civil War once Mm-hmm.

300
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:35,609
Speaker 0: It looked really realistic and well done and it was kind of cool But at the same time they got a little too into it.

301
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:38,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's what bothers me is, you know people get into it.

302
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,670
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you don't know let me explain secret wars really quickly because I had never even read it.

303
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,759
Speaker 1: I ordered the books though.

304
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,029
Speaker 1: She should be here in like two months.

305
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:56,758
Speaker 1: But secret wars is like the second time ever that comic books had like this giant event Right that had a bunch of million characters in it.

306
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,790
Speaker 1: And what basically happened is like I think it was the cosmic cube.

307
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:08,840
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but there was something in Central Park and all the Marvel superheroes went into it and it took them to some other Dimension where crazy shit happened.

308
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:11,470
Speaker 0: See this is why I don't like comics.

309
00:22:11,574 --> 00:22:21,390
Speaker 1: Yeah And basically spider-man with the galactic sewing machine or whatever the fuck it was Made the black and white spider-man costume that eventually became venom, you know.

310
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,061
Speaker 0: That's why I also don't like comics.

311
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:29,510
Speaker 1: and the thing Was able to switch between being the big rock guy and a human self.

312
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,728
Speaker 1: So he stayed there and everyone else went back and they fought a bunch of villains.

313
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:34,290
Speaker 1: and that was it.

314
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,670
Speaker 1: It was a secret war cuz no one knew about it because it took place in this other dimension.

315
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:38,950
Speaker 1: That's why it's called secret wars.

316
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:42,247
Speaker 0: so a sewing machine.

317
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:46,330
Speaker 1: It's kind of a sewing machine kind of not but it's essential.

318
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,583
Speaker 1: They don't use the word sewing machine, but it's essentially a galactic sewing machine.

319
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:51,807
Speaker 0: Great, right?

320
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:58,123
Speaker 1: So What these guys are reenacting is all the battles that went on in secret wars.

321
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,450
Speaker 0: So now this is obviously not real.

322
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,123
Speaker 0: This is obviously some kids making a funny thing like a fear of girls.

323
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:05,166
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

324
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:05,828
Speaker 1: That's what it is.

325
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:13,950
Speaker 1: But it's also hilarious, especially, you know There are a few jokes like even they're actually some obscure characters and they're like Kang.

326
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:25,949
Speaker 1: Kang is like one of the best dudes in Marvel Comics and no one even knows about Kang You know and it's the one guys dressed up as Kang and I think someone says to him something to him and he's like Kang doesn't blah blah blah.

327
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,315
Speaker 1: It's pretty hilarious.

328
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,009
Speaker 1: and the little kid with the Wolverine is pretty funny, too.

329
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want the guy trying to pick up the frisbee with the thing or Hulk hands the Hulk hands.

330
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:37,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was good, too The mr.

331
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,457
Speaker 1: Fantastic guys kind of weird.

332
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,470
Speaker 1: and then there's like the spider-man guy who doesn't know what he's doing.

333
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:49,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah the Doc Ock trying to wiggle his hips to hit the guy with his Doc Ock things.

334
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, just just watch it.

335
00:23:51,355 --> 00:23:52,037
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny.

336
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:55,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely not as good as fear of girls, but it's up there.

337
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:58,008
Speaker 1: Yep It's just another one of those things like that.

338
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:00,696
Speaker 1: And it's appropriate cuz it's comic day.

339
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,923
Speaker 0: people should not be afraid of cookie.

340
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,170
Speaker 0: cookie should be afraid of people.

341
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:07,347
Speaker 1: Cookie should be afraid of stomach acid.

342
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so we went to target.

343
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:15,569
Speaker 1: wait a minute.

344
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:22,270
Speaker 1: You know like there are people who believe that you know some magical God created them and they pray to that God.

345
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:24,849
Speaker 1: Do cookies pray to grandma for baking them?

346
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,270
Speaker 0: So we went to target.

347
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:32,782
Speaker 0: We went to Torah con this year this past weekend.

348
00:24:33,464 --> 00:24:48,057
Speaker 0: for those of you who only listen to anime day I suggest that you listen to the Monday episode this week Because we played on that episode our live panel from Torah con 2006 because that panel was largely about Podcasting and not about anime.

349
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:51,009
Speaker 1: We played it on Monday, even though we did it at an anime convention.

350
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:56,073
Speaker 0: Now Torah con is not a terribly widely known convention because this was its 2.5 one.

351
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

352
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:03,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically way way back when I was president of the RIT anime club.

353
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:12,530
Speaker 0: I Tried to Fiat threw a spring cosplay and it went All right, not that many people showed up But actually we had a really good promotional thing and there was a good event.

354
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:12,904
Speaker 0: It was fun.

355
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:20,869
Speaker 0: The next year after I graduated the next president of the anime club decided that they would go one step further and turn this into an actual one-day convention.

356
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:32,089
Speaker 0: hooray now Everyone in our crew the entire front row crew with the exception of Scott Drove out to torque on 2005 last year and had a ride his time.

357
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:36,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, now the funny thing is none of us expected torque on to be big or anything.

358
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,901
Speaker 0: We expected basically the same kind of events.

359
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,329
Speaker 0: The club has always thrown just a little thing.

360
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:43,337
Speaker 0: We got there and there were.

361
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:47,470
Speaker 0: there was a huge crazy crowd and a line out the door and it was fantastic.

362
00:25:47,651 --> 00:25:49,950
Speaker 0: For the first year of a con it was just amazing.

363
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:56,186
Speaker 0: So we came back this year this time as both of us guests and did a panel.

364
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:59,578
Speaker 1: Hooray Let's do a little crap.

365
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,837
Speaker 1: so driving up there was Somewhat unpleasant with the rain.

366
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:08,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically Rochester it rains there always.

367
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:11,250
Speaker 1: Well, no, the sky is always gray there.

368
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:20,010
Speaker 1: It just happened to be that when we were entering with as we got closer to Rochester It rained more and then when we finally left Rochester the rains started to subside.

369
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:26,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus we drove up real late Because you know people.

370
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:30,410
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, but we got there and it was weird.

371
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,539
Speaker 0: this was the first time where we visited Rochester place.

372
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:40,120
Speaker 0: we lived for some four or five years going to school and Instead of crashing on someone's floor or doing the thing.

373
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,728
Speaker 1: We always do we stayed in a hotel room Which is good because I could freakin sleep on a bed not on a floor.

374
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,996
Speaker 0: Yeah Shower is key.

375
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:59,521
Speaker 0: I mean no offense to our friends in college and Especially since our shower is just as bad but no one in Rochester at least at RIT has a shower that I can deal with anymore.

376
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:01,607
Speaker 1: No, no, no, damn.

377
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:05,749
Speaker 1: I Mean either they have low pressure or it's dirty.

378
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:07,636
Speaker 0: Dirty is the primary.

379
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:17,070
Speaker 0: this stuff in there one of our friends their bathroom in their in their apartment And our IT is so bad with mildew and mold that I if I walk in my eyes start watering.

380
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,124
Speaker 0: Wow, I pee in there with my eyes closed.

381
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:28,682
Speaker 0: Oh my god All right Yeah, but anyway, we you know stay in the hotel room crazy time and then in the morning we woke up and we went to Torricon.

382
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:35,089
Speaker 0: It wasn't much bigger than last year, but that doesn't really mean anything bad because that means it was still really big.

383
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't seem very crowded, you know, yeah

384
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,166
Speaker 0: But that also could be due to the fact that it used more rooms this year,

385
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:43,669
Speaker 1: uh-huh

386
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:52,614
Speaker 0: Now I will say that the primary thing we did at Torricon was actually sit in a big circle in various rooms throughout the con Playing DS games

387
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:53,557
Speaker 1: mostly Tetris.

388
00:27:53,617 --> 00:27:54,862
Speaker 0: Yeah Tetris is great.

389
00:27:55,003 --> 00:28:01,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna call this Tetris con Instead of Torricon, it would have been just as accurate But I got to say it's.

390
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:05,390
Speaker 0: I realized that I'm kind of addicted to going to conventions as a guest.

391
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:08,230
Speaker 0: Like it's different from going to a convention normally.

392
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:12,001
Speaker 0: I'm not used to going to a con and here's my money.

393
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:14,449
Speaker 0: Give me a badge because for so long it's been.

394
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:16,575
Speaker 0: hey I'm rim and oh, it's rim.

395
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:16,976
Speaker 0: All right.

396
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:20,184
Speaker 0: Here's your special magic badge that says something slightly different.

397
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:22,330
Speaker 0: that makes you 1% cooler than nobody.

398
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:26,210
Speaker 0: All right, so it was real nice to get in as a guest.

399
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,603
Speaker 1: It just meant I didn't have to pay though.

400
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:30,550
Speaker 1: It was a 12 bucks.

401
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,983
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a decent bit of money quite a bit more than last year.

402
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,334
Speaker 1: Yeah the 12 bucks I think you know.

403
00:28:35,354 --> 00:28:45,730
Speaker 1: while in the grand scheme 12 bucks is like nothing like if any con charge 12 bucks They're like sure 12 bucks is less than what we paid each for our dinner at Torricon.

404
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:54,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time considering the Torricon is so small and you're not really, you know I don't think you really get 12 bucks worth.

405
00:28:56,071 --> 00:29:09,310
Speaker 1: Get like 10 bucks worth maybe eight, you know, so while 12 isn't like exorbitantly overpriced It's it's like a tiny bit much and it some a lot of poor otaku types felt a little uncomfortable and I could see why.

406
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:12,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, well part of that was due to confusion at our IT.

407
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:17,185
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, some people thought it was 20 because some the SG listed it is 20 when it wasn't.

408
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:18,550
Speaker 1: yeah, that was a mess-up.

409
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not cool.

410
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:20,759
Speaker 1: 20 would have been outrageous.

411
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:22,184
Speaker 1: But you know 12 is.

412
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:31,370
Speaker 1: it was, you know near the limit Yeah, but I think it was fair considering that they had pine am do a concert Yeah, but then they charge you two bucks extra if you wanted a pine am ticket.

413
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:36,370
Speaker 0: I heard that that was because they got pine am at the last minute after they'd already set the prices.

414
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:37,153
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

415
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,983
Speaker 0: I don't know for sure since I'm not on their board or anything.

416
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:44,546
Speaker 1: as a matter two bucks is basically nothing Yeah, and they didn't charge for anything else besides that.

417
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:49,190
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think they'd like if you did the metal works panel you had to pay a little bit for your stuff.

418
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,390
Speaker 1: Well, no, I think what happened because we were the metal works panel was right before ours and I heard them talking.

419
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:56,091
Speaker 0: Well, it was listed as $3.

420
00:29:56,091 --> 00:30:03,743
Speaker 1: it was listed as three dollars, but it seemed like the metal works guys are the ones collecting that money because It was only paying for their materials and such.

421
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:09,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Those guys really didn't seem to care if the people didn't pay they just thought it was nice if you paid.

422
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really didn't seem to want to get out of our panel room and it was time for us to record our show.

423
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:25,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I heard a story later just to hearsay that they didn't want to get out of the their the room later when they Had a panel again because they had two panels, but whatever what workshops technically.

424
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway I mean, it's not a big con but it's a one-day thing and it's it's very fun.

425
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,574
Speaker 0: I think it's fairly well-run.

426
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:32,015
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

427
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,230
Speaker 0: I mean basically, you know, we got there and we saw all of our old friends again.

428
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,134
Speaker 0: It was a huge get-together.

429
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:38,320
Speaker 0: We couldn't walk five feet without.

430
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:40,610
Speaker 0: Hey, it's rim and Scott in the front row crew.

431
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,537
Speaker 1: Oh There's a person I haven't seen.

432
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:44,765
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a person I haven't seen you.

433
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:45,147
Speaker 1: There's a prison.

434
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:45,549
Speaker 1: I've been seen.

435
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:48,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, we saw some people with people I have seen.

436
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:54,455
Speaker 0: yeah, basically everyone was there with a few exceptions, but they all had good excuses Mm-hmm, except Ian.

437
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:55,499
Speaker 1: Yeah.

438
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,744
Speaker 1: Yeah his story is.

439
00:30:57,246 --> 00:31:01,447
Speaker 1: I don't think you listen to this So you should tell him to listen to this one, I think I did once.

440
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:03,495
Speaker 1: I don't know What he's doing.

441
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:11,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean they had a panel on web comics Which was funny because one we knew all the webcomic people on the panel and two None of them.

442
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:15,130
Speaker 0: really well I was one except they don't really update their comics so much anymore.

443
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,404
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm kind of.

444
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:23,370
Speaker 1: Their panel was actually a pretty good panel like and it was mildly entertaining all things considered.

445
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:28,750
Speaker 1: But at the same time I'm kind of phased, you know, every con has a freaking web comics panel.

446
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,295
Speaker 1: I just don't see the point of it anymore.

447
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:30,677
Speaker 1: Yeah.

448
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:34,450
Speaker 0: Well, it'd be like if we still do a podcasting panel two years from now.

449
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:38,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you're gonna have a panel at a con.

450
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:39,970
Speaker 1: sure you can make pretty much any panel.

451
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,894
Speaker 1: I could make a panel.

452
00:31:40,995 --> 00:31:44,929
Speaker 1: you can pick a random topic and I can make it entertaining, you know That's not the point.

453
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,290
Speaker 1: The point is if you have a panel at a con there should be a purpose to that.

454
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:50,576
Speaker 1: I feel there should be a purpose.

455
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:50,858
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:55,576
Speaker 0: Well to me I see two basic kinds of panels Informative and entertaining.

457
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:56,118
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

458
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,970
Speaker 0: And as long as you're one of the two, I don't really care what the panel is about.

459
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,965
Speaker 0: I mean with what the panel went to at Otacon last year.

460
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,435
Speaker 0: Mike Pfeffer's thing on Politics and anime.

461
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,177
Speaker 1: that was informative.

462
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:05,619
Speaker 1: Yes.

463
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,602
Speaker 0: It was also entertaining.

464
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:07,224
Speaker 1: Yeah.

465
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,572
Speaker 1: Well, that's cuz he's so cool Yep.

466
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:12,626
Speaker 0: Now we did a panel at Tora con that was very informative.

467
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,861
Speaker 0: It was here is Podcasting and how it works.

468
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:15,286
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

469
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,724
Speaker 0: Now if we do this again, we'll probably be a lot less informative and a lot more entertaining.

470
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:21,690
Speaker 0: and the webcomic panel.

471
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,465
Speaker 0: It was very entertaining but there's really nothing left to be said about web comics.

472
00:32:25,866 --> 00:32:28,015
Speaker 0: every web comics panel Everyone asked the same questions.

473
00:32:28,457 --> 00:32:29,200
Speaker 0: How do you do it?

474
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,646
Speaker 0: How long does it take to do it?

475
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,730
Speaker 0: Why did you start?

476
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,334
Speaker 0: What comics do you read?

477
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:37,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I don't you know, that's the part of it that I don't see the point of anymore.

478
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:46,354
Speaker 1: you might as well just have a You know don't call it a web comics panel because it's kind of dumb to have web comics panels ever call it like You know.

479
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:47,260
Speaker 1: panel.

480
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,772
Speaker 1: meet webcomic artists you know.

481
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:54,305
Speaker 1: or webcomic artists chat or call it something different and you know.

482
00:32:54,806 --> 00:33:07,966
Speaker 1: bill it as an Entertaining talk with webcomic artists and not as the web comics panel where everyone talks about webcomics Yep, which luckily that's what the three webcomic artists did in their panel here at Otakon at Tora Con.

483
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:20,690
Speaker 1: Well, that's the other thing is that even if you bill a web comics panel as talking about web comics Webcomic artists have talked about that stuff so much on panels a thousand times and there's nothing left to be said.

484
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:26,282
Speaker 1: So they end up just having to do what I said They should do anyway, which is just be entertaining and have a fun time.

485
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:28,130
Speaker 0: Yep, which to me is the best kind of panel?

486
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:38,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the worst kind of panels the ones where guys just sit there go Yeah Nothing hat or even they don't do anything and they don't show up.

487
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:40,890
Speaker 0: or hey people not showing up for a panel is great.

488
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,005
Speaker 0: That's how I got my start in this whole panel business.

489
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:49,324
Speaker 1: Yeah But there's also industry panels which I don't go to but they have a purpose to like.

490
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,370
Speaker 1: those are quote real panels.

491
00:33:52,132 --> 00:34:01,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know where they have like announcements to make Guests to like question and announce things and that sort of shit.

492
00:34:02,914 --> 00:34:03,889
Speaker 1: That's a real panel.

493
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,300
Speaker 0: But overall that panel is really fun.

494
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:08,750
Speaker 0: The panel we ran actually was very fun, too.

495
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,447
Speaker 0: We had a decent crowd and they seem to like us.

496
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:14,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, you heard that on Monday, yep, you can hear him cheering in the background.

497
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:23,389
Speaker 1: The dealing at the con was done mostly in the main lobby and There really wasn't anything for me to buy at all.

498
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,226
Speaker 1: I think the best thing I saw was like a bank that was shaped like a question block.

499
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:30,422
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, I guess for me, I'm just jaded to dealers rooms.

500
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,150
Speaker 0: I buy almost nothing at cons anymore.

501
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,463
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the thing with dealers rooms is like originally.

502
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:41,022
Speaker 1: it was like that There was stuff there that you'd never seen before but you really wanted you like.

503
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:43,370
Speaker 1: Oh my god amazing imported goods from Japan.

504
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,176
Speaker 1: I must have them all.

505
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,525
Speaker 0: yep capsule toys capsule toys.

506
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:46,029
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

507
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,103
Speaker 1: Yeah, but once you get them all or you get enough of them, it's like, okay.

508
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,087
Speaker 1: What do you have?

509
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:51,748
Speaker 1: That's new.

510
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,250
Speaker 1: Do you have you know this new Mario diorama thing?

511
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,364
Speaker 1: Do you have this new plushie from this brand new anime that everyone's into?

512
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:02,252
Speaker 1: and if you don't have anything new It's like.

513
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:03,439
Speaker 1: I've seen all this stuff before.

514
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,727
Speaker 1: I already know I don't want it.

515
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:12,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've gotten to the point where I go to a dealers room and I want like one or two specific things and I just Walk around looking for those things.

516
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first two Otakons I went to where the dealers room is tremendous.

517
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:21,890
Speaker 1: You know, you see everything and you've already know your brain has already said I don't want that and I do want this.

518
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,970
Speaker 1: It's like if you go to a video game store and then you go to the same video game store the next day.

519
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:37,189
Speaker 1: You already know the parts of the store that have stuff and what's generally there and that you don't want it and you go right to the place that has the stuff that you might want the new releases or whatever.

520
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:40,035
Speaker 1: and That's what dealers rooms turned into.

521
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:44,390
Speaker 1: is you gloss over everything you've seen and you go right for the new stuff and then you're done.

522
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:53,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least the unique stuff that I may not be new, but I didn't realize existed Yeah, that's another thing is like I don't want to spend too much time in the dealer room because it could be a waste of Time.

523
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:53,908
Speaker 1: it's a risk.

524
00:35:54,291 --> 00:36:02,647
Speaker 1: but at the same time you can tell the interesting dealers when they start to have like Weird things that don't look conventional

525
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:03,070
Speaker 0: like first

526
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:08,095
Speaker 1: I get down and I start rooting through all of it to find you know Like the rare hot piece

527
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:11,948
Speaker 0: like you see the dealer that has DVDs at basically retail prices.

528
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:12,450
Speaker 0: ignore him.

529
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:14,986
Speaker 0: You see the other dealer with the exact same setup.

530
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:15,529
Speaker 0: ignore him.

531
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:21,067
Speaker 0: You see the dealer that has all the $40 Japanese CDs and $100 art books.

532
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:33,545
Speaker 0: you ignore him and then you find the one that has like the cool weird bin of crap or discount manga for a dollar or Crazy imported weird thing that you've never seen in the US before.

533
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:34,369
Speaker 0: look at this thing

534
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:46,329
Speaker 1: You can always tell like there was a one dealer at Otacon last year where the the booth was set up weird with like these White racks and like there were things hanging from overhead and everything like that and it was real crowded to walk around.

535
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:46,650
Speaker 1: the booth.

536
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,110
Speaker 1: Wasn't the best booth design in terms of crowd control?

537
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,950
Speaker 0: Well, it might have been due to the fact that I don't think he expected to quite the crowd at his booth.

538
00:36:54,292 --> 00:37:05,979
Speaker 1: yeah, but everything in that booth was like You know, it was mostly imported mangas and art books and things that you'd never seen before because you know the major importers like Kino Kuni.

539
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:11,318
Speaker 1: you don't get that stuff because not stuff you get in bulk and It wasn't stuff that was ever translated here.

540
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:12,784
Speaker 1: See then you start looking around.

541
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:14,350
Speaker 1: you find all this weird stuff.

542
00:37:14,671 --> 00:37:20,010
Speaker 1: It's not really, you know outlandish, but it's stuff you've never seen before in your life didn't know it existed.

543
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:29,010
Speaker 1: So then you start to look through every single item the guy has and every single weird, you know He doesn't have things organized so well with everything in the same place.

544
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:35,393
Speaker 1: So I'll have like a pin like hanging up on the side of a little white rack and you like oh, you know And those are the.

545
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,919
Speaker 1: that's the dealers you spend time in.

546
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,320
Speaker 0: Yep.

547
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,665
Speaker 0: That's actually how I got my.

548
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:39,890
Speaker 0: it's one of my favorite little bits.

549
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,110
Speaker 0: It's a con badge holder.

550
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:49,470
Speaker 0: It exists solely to hold convention badges as far as I can tell and it's a really cool little piece of I guess jewelry.

551
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:56,179
Speaker 0: And I just found it by itself hanging from actually the ceiling of one Guys booth at Katsucon last year.

552
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:56,259
Speaker 0: Hmm.

553
00:37:57,102 --> 00:37:59,150
Speaker 1: It's all about the nooks and crannies, you know.

554
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,990
Speaker 1: So when you have a little dealers room like the one at Tora con There really aren't so many nooks and crannies and you see pretty much everything.

555
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,863
Speaker 1: They've got from 10 feet away and you don't need to.

556
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:10,390
Speaker 1: you know deal a lot.

557
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,709
Speaker 0: But at the same time they seem to be doing brisk business.

558
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:16,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think you know a lot of people.

559
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:31,342
Speaker 1: they're probably never been to a con or you know Their first Tora con at least and the dealers didn't seem like they were super used to dealing You know at many big conventions, so no, what do you expect?

560
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:31,663
Speaker 1: Yep.

561
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:33,469
Speaker 0: I mean it is a small convention.

562
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:35,505
Speaker 0: still though I do think it's gonna grow in time.

563
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:42,869
Speaker 1: Hmm So, let's see the head of video game room, which I didn't spend more than also five minutes in Yeah, but it was definitely spacious which is key.

564
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:57,650
Speaker 1: Yeah It was good that it was spacious and give give people a lot of room to move around and breathe and all that spectate but at the same time it didn't seem like they had too many games going on and They're you know, they had the shitty small TVs.

565
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:08,929
Speaker 0: well for chairs the fact because I mean I used to do all this if the fact that they had so few TVs leads me To believe that the TVs were allocated elsewhere by RIT and they had fewer TVs than they wanted I'm pretty sure that's the case.

566
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:16,489
Speaker 0: But you know though to me the only failing of the video game room is that they should have Encouraged and set up something to do with a Nintendo DS.

567
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:26,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, every con I've been to since the DS came out has been just a flood of DS's and you'll see whole groups of people Just sitting down all over the place playing DS games wirelessly.

568
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,488
Speaker 1: I didn't see too many DS's other than ours though.

569
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:36,977
Speaker 0: It's weird Yeah, but I mean I've been to RIT during anime club meetings recently and yeah 30 or 40 DS's all whipped out.

570
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:37,378
Speaker 0: Hmm.

571
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,493
Speaker 0: So yeah, maybe because people there I mean, it's RIT It's a campus.

572
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,061
Speaker 0: Everyone's playing DS games all the time.

573
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,990
Speaker 0: So when they go to a con they want to do con stuff.

574
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:49,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus there were with three tournaments and none of them were really exciting.

575
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,390
Speaker 1: They should have had at least one fun tournament like a Mario Tennis or something.

576
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,056
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I don't think they had.

577
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:57,928
Speaker 0: I don't know why but they didn't run any big tournaments.

578
00:39:58,169 --> 00:40:01,490
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, well, the artist's alley was pretty good.

579
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,972
Speaker 1: The only thing that you know, it could have been bigger, but I think they had it just right for the room They put it in.

580
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:09,850
Speaker 0: Yep, because there aren't so many rooms they can use in the building that they have the con in.

581
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:13,827
Speaker 0: So that was pretty much the only room they could put that in unless it got really really big.

582
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:17,219
Speaker 0: Yeah But I mean the art there was typical of artist's alleys.

583
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:17,701
Speaker 0: It was good.

584
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,970
Speaker 0: We had some friends in there who have awesome art.

585
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:20,432
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

586
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:23,830
Speaker 1: There were some people in there with not so awesome art, but that's how artist's alleys go.

587
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,618
Speaker 1: You know, not everyone's super amazing.

588
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,788
Speaker 1: Oh my god art, you know, if everyone is super amazing.

589
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:33,907
Speaker 1: Oh my god art There wouldn't be any crap art and then the super amazing wouldn't be super amazing and etc.

590
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:41,628
Speaker 0: Now, of course true to its roots the main thing about ToraCon I mean basically up until the cosplay.

591
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:46,249
Speaker 0: ToraCon is basically just getting people to hang out long enough for the cosplay to start.

592
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:48,135
Speaker 0: Toric I mean start.

593
00:40:48,175 --> 00:40:57,599
Speaker 0: there was a. it started as a cosplay and then it became a con But it was centered around the cosplay and now it's becoming a real con bit by bit like a big con But it's definitely still.

594
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,585
Speaker 0: the cosplay is like.

595
00:40:58,645 --> 00:40:59,450
Speaker 0: this is the main event.

596
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:08,190
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like a lot of conventions the cosplay is the main event, you know Even when you go to Otacon you can totally ignore the cosplay and get a crazy con.

597
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,229
Speaker 1: They oh the cosplay is still crazy huge.

598
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:19,541
Speaker 1: Yep, even when they have a main event like a concert with a real band The cosplay is like perhaps bigger or if not equal.

599
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:20,142
Speaker 0: Yep, though.

600
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:21,045
Speaker 0: Definitely ToraCon.

601
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,830
Speaker 0: Nothing was scheduled opposite the cosplay.

602
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:28,110
Speaker 0: So, I mean there were things going on during the day, but pretty much it was after the cosplay started.

603
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,844
Speaker 0: it was cosplay and the concert and The dance and nothing overlapped anything.

604
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:37,415
Speaker 0: from that point on Cool seem to work fairly.

605
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:39,563
Speaker 0: Well, there was definitely time to get dinner which was good.

606
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:41,390
Speaker 1: Yeah the cosplay itself.

607
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,339
Speaker 1: I went to some of the skits.

608
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,340
Speaker 1: I think there were two skits that were real funny and good Yeah, the Legend of Zelda skit.

609
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:57,182
Speaker 1: that one was actually really good Yeah, and some of there were a few really good costumes there too like surprisingly But at the same time it didn't have a whole.

610
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:59,071
Speaker 1: the quantity wasn't there, you know It was.

611
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:02,210
Speaker 0: it was over pretty quickly like, you know what that made me very happy.

612
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:12,965
Speaker 0: I I like watching cosplays because a lot of times it'll you'll see the diamond in the rough the awesome sketch or that the awesome Costume, but I can't waste two hours of my time at Otacon.

613
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:18,905
Speaker 1: Yeah at Otacon We've made a habit of just kind of moseying into the you know spillover.

614
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,370
Speaker 1: Yeah the spillover room.

615
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:26,721
Speaker 1: They always have a spillover room even though they you know Even if the regular cosplay room doesn't fill up.

616
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:38,133
Speaker 1: They always have the cosplay like Video casted in another room live and it's always so much better to go there cuz not crowded and you can see better and It's just great.

617
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:43,729
Speaker 1: Yep, and they usually in that same room show the really good movies late on Saturday night.

618
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep But I mean the cosplay toricon was short and it was pretty good and I really enjoyed it and the fact that it was short Was very key and me enjoying it.

619
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one thing that's wrong about.

620
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:58,766
Speaker 1: You know bigger cons is that the cause any cosplay is 90% crap 10% awesome.

621
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:06,830
Speaker 1: So the shorter it is the less time you spend crap and you still get the same amount of awesome.

622
00:43:07,473 --> 00:43:14,549
Speaker 0: Though the one main thing about the cosplay at toricon that I like is that last year I was actually cosplay judge and this year I was not but I did other things instead.

623
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,849
Speaker 0: The cosplay was actually run very professionally and very well by the people who were in charge of it.

624
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:31,530
Speaker 0: They had a sort of crisis where the person who was in charge of the cosplay was for various reasons He left the board and was no longer in charge of the cosplay right before the con.

625
00:43:32,472 --> 00:43:36,890
Speaker 0: So someone else was forced to take his place and run the whole cosplay basically on almost no notice.

626
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:42,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, and considering that they did a pretty good job even not considering that that was an extremely well-run cosplay.

627
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,735
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean even Otacon.

628
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:47,066
Speaker 0: they have a lot of trouble running the cosplay smoothly.

629
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:50,290
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, they're always like oh who's on next who's right, you know.

630
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,589
Speaker 1: The only time they messed up I think at this one was they had.

631
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:56,246
Speaker 1: They seemed like they had a piece of paper for every skit and cosplayer.

632
00:43:56,286 --> 00:44:01,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how you do it Yeah, and I think they lost one of the pieces of paper and that was the worst thing that happened.

633
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:02,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it was really well done.

634
00:44:02,815 --> 00:44:04,319
Speaker 0: Like I was actually really impressed.

635
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:06,586
Speaker 1: Yeah had the shit together all good.

636
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:10,724
Speaker 0: now after that We got dinner and then there was the concert pine.

637
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:20,330
Speaker 1: and yeah I had heard of pine am like I knew it was the name of a Japanese band of girls who made music And then I knew they were no Otacon and I didn't see them.

638
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,970
Speaker 1: I think I saw them from far away, but didn't actually listen to the music or anything.

639
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd been told of their music, but I hadn't actually heard it and it was.

640
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:38,422
Speaker 0: it was described to me by someone as Almost electric electro pop but almost techno but not really Yeah, and with cute Japanese girls and that didn't really explain anything to me.

641
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:43,317
Speaker 1: No, I didn't so considering you know, that was like The biggest thing going on at Tora con.

642
00:44:43,357 --> 00:44:46,890
Speaker 1: we paid our two bucks and we went to see it and it was pretty good.

643
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:48,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I there there.

644
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:50,330
Speaker 0: two of the three band members were there.

645
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,405
Speaker 0: They put on I'd say a really good set in an actual real auditorium.

646
00:44:53,425 --> 00:45:04,337
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm He the crowd was a little sedated first, which might have surprised them but then a bunch of people ran up to the front and then I ran up to the front and then everyone ran up to The front ever started dancing and screaming.

647
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:08,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have run up to the front to like I wanted to but I food.

648
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:12,150
Speaker 1: Well, there was the Thai food and the the hours and hours of driving and I was like, you know what?

649
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,255
Speaker 1: I haven't sat down all day.

650
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:14,400
Speaker 1: I can see it.

651
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:16,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I ran straight up to the front.

652
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,947
Speaker 0: I was literally about three feet away from the the singers.

653
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:24,369
Speaker 0: Yep It was a. it was a really good concert and they seemed to really get into it.

654
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:31,709
Speaker 0: in fact after the concert They set up a little table right outside and they signed pretty much as many autographs as people were there who wanted them.

655
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:36,649
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like they're that crazy popular in Japan or the US.

656
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:39,176
Speaker 1: so You know, they're sort of like.

657
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:43,570
Speaker 1: they're not an independent, you know garage band, but they're like one step above that.

658
00:45:44,052 --> 00:45:47,144
Speaker 0: They definitely don't make enough money however to keep themselves going.

659
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,570
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

660
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,669
Speaker 1: I mean if you have any success at all.

661
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:54,224
Speaker 1: It's like with a record company with being a musical artist.

662
00:45:54,324 --> 00:46:00,750
Speaker 1: if you're in it with a record company There's like this line and when once you're below the line you're in trouble, but as soon as you cross the line, it's great.

663
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:14,102
Speaker 1: Especially, you know, if you're actually musically talented you do all sorts of other things besides just your band, you know You do all sorts of other musical things to make money also Yep, and I got to say I do really like their music now that I've heard it.

664
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:18,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't the worst music It wasn't the best music, but it was decent.

665
00:46:18,939 --> 00:46:20,103
Speaker 1: It wasn't painful to listen to.

666
00:46:20,123 --> 00:46:30,027
Speaker 1: you know, I was pretty much just Groovin, I wouldn't download it and listen to it my car But I wouldn't mind listening to it if someone else popped it into a CD player, whatever.

667
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,676
Speaker 0: Yeah I'll probably acquire an album at some point.

668
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:36,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's I mean the two singers were actually really cool.

669
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:44,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like they were much Like the people themselves were much cooler than at least my opinion of their music.

670
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:47,821
Speaker 1: It's like someone is so cool and then they make decent music.

671
00:46:48,323 --> 00:46:49,487
Speaker 1: That's not as cool as they are.

672
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:53,425
Speaker 0: But okay No, the crowd seemed to love them and I don't know.

673
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:54,610
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll be back next year.

674
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,278
Speaker 0: I don't know what'll happen to next Tora con.

675
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll have to do something.

676
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,850
Speaker 0: Who knows I mean this was the torque on first musical guest.

677
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,585
Speaker 0: I think it was a really good pick because it was like it was a good band.

678
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:09,905
Speaker 0: It was a good show and It's actually really it's kind of rare for a small con to get a not up.

679
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:15,949
Speaker 0: not it's not definitely not a big name But a sizable good band for as little money and resources as they had.

680
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:19,462
Speaker 1: Usually if you have a tiny con like this, you're lucky to get.

681
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,630
Speaker 0: you're lucky to get like industry person.

682
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:25,990
Speaker 0: You're lucky to get like the one guy in town who kind of knows how to play a Final Fantasy song on his guitar.

683
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:28,129
Speaker 1: You're lucky if you get piano squall.

684
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:32,065
Speaker 1: Or you're lucky if you get like one guy from a TV to show up.

685
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,353
Speaker 0: anyone can get piano squall You just have to pay.

686
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:35,056
Speaker 0: Yeah.

687
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:35,498
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,326
Speaker 1: Well, he doesn't Oda Khan doesn't pay him.

689
00:47:37,707 --> 00:47:40,658
Speaker 1: Yeah But he does that one for free.

690
00:47:40,698 --> 00:47:41,684
Speaker 1: That's his advertising.

691
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:47,850
Speaker 1: But the point is The fact that you get like a real band at a little tiny con.

692
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:49,573
Speaker 1: It's just huge.

693
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'm really props to them for doing that plus the.

694
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:53,690
Speaker 0: they took it.

695
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,290
Speaker 0: I don't know if they took the suggestion from us.

696
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,320
Speaker 0: I think it's just the natural progression of things in a con.

697
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,190
Speaker 0: but this year they had a dance slash rave after the concert.

698
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:03,490
Speaker 1: You kind of need one of those in any con nowadays.

699
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:12,063
Speaker 0: Well last year when we went after the cosplay and impromptu dance slash rave Started all on its own in the cosplay room afterwards.

700
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:13,770
Speaker 1: How did you just get a boombox?

701
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,013
Speaker 0: Well, we're in the.

702
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:21,114
Speaker 0: they were in the web auditorium and someone just put a CD on and everyone just stuck around and danced until We basically got kicked out.

703
00:48:21,134 --> 00:48:21,776
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

704
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:25,850
Speaker 0: So this year they actually got a real DJ who was mixing vinyl out there.

705
00:48:26,552 --> 00:48:33,409
Speaker 0: And while I'm not the hugest fan of you know, straight-up house mixing with vinyl I just I'm not that interested in that kind of music.

706
00:48:34,513 --> 00:48:36,390
Speaker 0: The guy was really good like the DJ.

707
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,269
Speaker 0: I forget his name, but he was really good at what he did and I think he put on a good show.

708
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:41,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, like.

709
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:53,058
Speaker 1: I'm not really a fan of like being in the dance club while they're playing the dumb dumb dumb Technos, but I actually kind of like listening to good Electronic music just listening.

710
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:55,513
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I like dancing to it But I don't like.

711
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,410
Speaker 0: I don't usually like dancing to the stuff that people in clubs tend to play.

712
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:01,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the people in clubs in the US don't tend to play the type of techno I like.

713
00:49:02,305 --> 00:49:06,469
Speaker 1: but listening to this guy You know through the walls because you can hear it from anywhere nearby.

714
00:49:07,251 --> 00:49:12,074
Speaker 1: Some of the at least the parts that I was listening to in his music were like, yeah, it's a good techno All right.

715
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:14,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, and people were for the most part actually dancing.

716
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:21,580
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I was a little disappointed that he didn't play more anime related stuff But I mean, that's me and that's the kind of dance music I like.

717
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:26,509
Speaker 0: but the fact that despite that he played music That was good enough for me to go dance to it was good.

718
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:36,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I would have if I would have been in the mood to get up to the front at the pine am concert I probably would have spent some time in the rave instead of just poking my head in and not poking it.

719
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, again, though while I poked my head in I'll say that the sound system was good.

720
00:49:41,491 --> 00:49:46,150
Speaker 0: The music was you know, like if we said good there was very little funk which made me very happy.

721
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:53,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't think there was really funk anywhere in the con so much Like I didn't have a bad smell at all.

722
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,070
Speaker 1: and when we were at the little tiny video game con there was smell.

723
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:01,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one Oh God aiming for hope how to smell and not toricon not at all.

724
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:06,342
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially considering it was kind of humid and kind of hot all weekend.

725
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:07,987
Speaker 1: Did you there wasn't any DDR?

726
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:08,970
Speaker 1: toricon was there?

727
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,058
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised if that was a conscious decision.

728
00:50:12,339 --> 00:50:14,607
Speaker 1: Maybe I think was there a guitar hero.

729
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:15,450
Speaker 1: I didn't see that either.

730
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:26,142
Speaker 0: No, actually now that I think about it No, they didn't have any of that as far as I could tell but last year the video gaming was all in the fireside lounge Which is this huge huge huge room this year.

731
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:28,350
Speaker 0: They didn't have that room for the whole con.

732
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:30,169
Speaker 0: I think that threw a kink in all their plans.

733
00:50:30,581 --> 00:50:33,298
Speaker 1: Yeah someone else was using that room for part of the time.

734
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:40,943
Speaker 0: they were pissed those other people because there's a giant dance party and all These crazy anime people running around and they're having some sort of like award ceremony thing.

735
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:43,010
Speaker 1: It's sort of banquet pageant thing.

736
00:50:43,392 --> 00:50:44,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was great.

737
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:50,324
Speaker 1: But before they took that room over I think the They used it for the music video showing.

738
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:53,339
Speaker 0: Yep, which we did I forgot to talk about but it was actually.

739
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,484
Speaker 0: I mean, it wasn't great.

740
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:59,428
Speaker 0: We played Tetris during it Yeah, but we stood up and watched, you know bits of all the videos to get a feel for it.

741
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:04,130
Speaker 0: Most cons these days have really crappy anime music video contests.

742
00:51:04,211 --> 00:51:05,037
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna lie.

743
00:51:05,097 --> 00:51:06,750
Speaker 0: most cons just the AMV is that are coming.

744
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,550
Speaker 1: Well, there's nothing to do with the cons has to do with the fact that people making music video these days are just terrible.

745
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,659
Speaker 1: Yeah back in the day It was hard to do so.

746
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:18,002
Speaker 1: people wouldn't do it unless they were gonna put in a whole lot of effort to make something really good.

747
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:20,110
Speaker 1: and it sort of went on this curve of.

748
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:23,909
Speaker 1: Okay, some people put in a lot of effort to make something really great.

749
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,614
Speaker 1: The technology got better.

750
00:51:25,915 --> 00:51:28,262
Speaker 1: people kept as a technology made it easier.

751
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:32,035
Speaker 1: people kept doing a better and better job and making better and better Music videos.

752
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:34,169
Speaker 1: then the technology made it too easy.

753
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:37,050
Speaker 1: So now people don't make as good music videos.

754
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,134
Speaker 1: It's so easy to make them.

755
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:42,590
Speaker 0: now some people still do but they're just harder to find or harder to sift out through all the crap.

756
00:51:42,912 --> 00:51:44,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, or they just keep it to themselves.

757
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:45,406
Speaker 1: a lot of them.

758
00:51:45,426 --> 00:51:46,030
Speaker 1: They're kind of scary.

759
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:52,729
Speaker 0: So bearing that in mind that our opinion is we're fairly elitist when it comes to AMVs and we were very kind of.

760
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:53,653
Speaker 1: well It's all relative.

761
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:59,110
Speaker 1: Like if I'd never seen an AMV before and I had seen the ones shown at ToraCon I would have been like holy crap.

762
00:51:59,151 --> 00:51:59,399
Speaker 0: Yeah.

763
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:07,030
Speaker 1: But seeing is that your music video has to compete with all the anime music videos I've seen in the past.

764
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got you're up against a tough bunch.

765
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the mama Leo hit me baby one more time.

766
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:16,510
Speaker 1: It's sort of unfair because when you think about it, you look at something like sports.

767
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:24,118
Speaker 1: Right, the Mets team playing right now in baseball doesn't have to compete with Previous baseball teams.

768
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:26,510
Speaker 1: They only have to compete with the ones that exist right now.

769
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,344
Speaker 1: But you know seeing is that music videos aren't sports.

770
00:52:31,906 --> 00:52:36,004
Speaker 1: you make something now You have to compete with everything that ever existed.

771
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:37,110
Speaker 1: It's really hard to win.

772
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:41,024
Speaker 0: Like you might have the best idea for an Evangelion music video ever like.

773
00:52:41,065 --> 00:52:46,130
Speaker 0: seriously your idea is awesome And you were an awesome person, but there are so many Ava music videos.

774
00:52:46,471 --> 00:52:49,381
Speaker 0: Don't even bother because there's no way anyone will even notice it.

775
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:50,725
Speaker 1: I mean look at the f1 race.

776
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:55,010
Speaker 1: He just watched, you know Alonzo is doing really really well.

777
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:06,174
Speaker 1: He didn't win the most recent race But if anyone had to compete with not Michael Schumacher now But Michael Schumacher of five years ago in his better car you couldn't win It.

778
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:07,059
Speaker 1: just that's how it is.

779
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, so bear all that in mind.

780
00:53:08,878 --> 00:53:12,990
Speaker 0: I mean I can't say the AMVs were great because a very few AMVs are great to me anymore.

781
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:16,241
Speaker 0: The AMVs were typical of big good conventions.

782
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:18,710
Speaker 0: Like it was the kind of AMV contest I'd expect from an Otacon.

783
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:22,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there were two sappy one two or three sappy ones I wasn't interested in.

784
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:25,403
Speaker 0: there were the typical whole bunch of fighting scene ones.

785
00:53:25,564 --> 00:53:27,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ones with a whole bunch of fighting scenes.

786
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:33,683
Speaker 1: There was one that could have been a little better Where the action scenes didn't really match the music.

787
00:53:33,763 --> 00:53:41,530
Speaker 1: because if you're gonna do the action Music video, you know, what you have to do is you have to match the beats of the music to the action.

788
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,577
Speaker 1: That's what makes those things cool to watch.

789
00:53:43,817 --> 00:53:47,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you don't get it right on it's like, uh, you know what?

790
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:53,950
Speaker 0: Let's do a whole show on AMVs Because we could actually go point-for-point examples like this.

791
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:57,850
Speaker 1: This is one of the categories and this is how to make a good video in those categories.

792
00:53:58,031 --> 00:54:04,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think cuz we're really kind of like connoisseur slash snobs when it comes to the sort of thing kind of Comes to a lot of things.

793
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, we are.

794
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,070
Speaker 1: That's the point of this.

795
00:54:06,238 --> 00:54:06,347
Speaker 0: Yeah.

796
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,925
Speaker 0: So while I said the AMV is a torque on weren't great take that with the grain of.

797
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:15,121
Speaker 0: we are elitist bastard salt Because it was a really good AMV contest.

798
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:16,950
Speaker 0: Like I really given props for pulling that off.

799
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,226
Speaker 1: There was that one video that was actually like five as among Adil videos attached to that was.

800
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:23,670
Speaker 0: that was cheating in my opinion.

801
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,010
Speaker 1: I also counted as cheating.

802
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:31,947
Speaker 1: But if you separate it into five separate videos, like it should have been the first one was a was really good.

803
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

804
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:34,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about it.

805
00:54:35,288 --> 00:54:42,115
Speaker 0: Yep And I mean overall torque on was a great time and anyone who lives anywhere near the Rochester area I highly recommend you check it out.

806
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:43,078
Speaker 0: It's super cheap.

807
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:44,261
Speaker 0: It's only one day.

808
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,450
Speaker 0: if you need a hotel hotels in Rochester cost nothing.

809
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:55,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like a lot of the hotels really close were either expensive or full But we found one a short ways away for nothing.

810
00:54:56,271 --> 00:55:02,938
Speaker 0: I think the reason most of the hotels I looked at were sold out was due to the fact that I waited until three days Before we left to get the hotel room.

811
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:05,327
Speaker 1: Yeah with Otacon you have to get a year in advance.

812
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:09,268
Speaker 1: with Tora Khan I think a couple months in advance is it would be okay, but not three days.

813
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:09,690
Speaker 1: three days.

814
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:11,530
Speaker 1: This isn't okay for anywhere at any time.

815
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, except for like on the highway where you get off and you stop at any hotel you want.

816
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:21,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean really if you live anywhere near Rochester definitely check out Tora Khan.

817
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,015
Speaker 0: It's really fun and it's growing.

818
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:34,629
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't want to commit to anything, but I would wager within four or five more years It's gonna be one of the not be like huge cons not a mega con like an Otacon But I think it'll be one of the bigger cons.

819
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:36,174
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll see.

820
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:39,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could see it even moving into Rochester and out of our IT.

821
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,622
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

822
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:44,894
Speaker 0: Yep Now I guess we'll wrap up this episode With.

823
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:55,261
Speaker 0: I didn't do a lot of interviews at the con for various reasons Mostly because I was busy doing other things and I wasn't too worried about Interviewing people since we recorded a whole hour of us doing a panel

824
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:58,312
Speaker 1: and we didn't really have a lot of interesting things to ask People.

825
00:55:58,513 --> 00:56:07,910
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean when we go to Otacon, I'm gonna one we're gonna interview people about Otacon But two I'm gonna interview people about anime and have a whole separate set of interviews for like another show sometime.

826
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:13,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, we actually you know cuz just going in with a little thing in a record II bit doesn't really work.

827
00:56:14,031 --> 00:56:20,878
Speaker 1: I think we had to take a cue from the anime world order guy who actually had a plan for what he was gonna ask People in his search for the truth.

828
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:21,320
Speaker 0: Yep.

829
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,790
Speaker 0: Well, my plan for toricon was very specifically.

830
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:26,967
Speaker 0: I just want to get a cross-section of what people at the con thought of the con.

831
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:30,559
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm So I didn't really ask any particularly the hard-hitting questions.

832
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:31,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe none of that.

833
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,083
Speaker 0: None of that.

834
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:34,290
Speaker 0: Why are you dressed up as a blah-blah-blah?

835
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe an Otacon we should do like a search for the lies.

836
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:42,189
Speaker 1: Oh speaking of anime world order I don't want to forget to say this for yet another week.

837
00:56:43,053 --> 00:56:45,703
Speaker 1: We did an episode a while ago about Lupin the third.

838
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,389
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

839
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:57,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did this show on Lupin the third mostly because we were tired and it's easy to talk about Lupin because we love it And they sent us an email that was very informative and awesome.

840
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:11,890
Speaker 1: Oh Yes, after we did our Lupin the third episode the anime world order people who knows so much more about anime than we do Sent us a little email with all the mistakes we made in that episode.

841
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:21,210
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna read the whole thing because it's not worth my time or yours But let me just tell you the interesting tidbits of things we messed up about Lupin.

842
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least we were dead on about Zenigata.

843
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:25,278
Speaker 1: We were dead on about Zenigata.

844
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:26,040
Speaker 1: So forget about him.

845
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:34,089
Speaker 1: Apparently we said something like the first series of Lupin like that was all you you said.

846
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:35,873
Speaker 1: yeah Because I did.

847
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:47,138
Speaker 1: I watched like the first episode of the original Lupin series and it was really kind of 70s and corny and kitschy and all that sort of thing And the second series wasn't just kind of corny and silly.

848
00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:50,827
Speaker 1: it was silly in the Lupin that I know that's my Lupin.

849
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:56,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, but The first series got canceled after 23 episodes.

850
00:57:56,199 --> 00:58:00,350
Speaker 1: And of course, actually I just downloaded all those 23 episodes today.

851
00:58:01,296 --> 00:58:05,234
Speaker 1: Some of those episodes are by Miyazaki Which is interesting.

852
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:07,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Scott got booed.

853
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:11,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to go watch those and we'll we'll get back to you on that one.

854
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,129
Speaker 1: Apparently jigen his name.

855
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:17,994
Speaker 1: That's not his real name.

856
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:20,041
Speaker 1: He's not actually a Japanese, dude.

857
00:58:20,182 --> 00:58:22,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember hearing that he was like half Japanese or something.

858
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:30,419
Speaker 1: No, he's like, uh, he's like a Chicago mafia dude who ran away Or something like that, they don't no one actually really knows.

859
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,749
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean the Lupin movie the live-action.

860
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:38,726
Speaker 0: one Supposes or puts forth a history, but I don't know if that movie is actually canon.

861
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:44,382
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Goa Mon was actually not in the manga for a long time.

862
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:53,390
Speaker 1: Like he wasn't even in Lupin at all and He started out in the manga as an assassin that someone hired to kill Lupin and then he just kind of stuck around.

863
00:58:53,952 --> 00:58:55,076
Speaker 0: I'm very happy about that.

864
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:55,276
Speaker 0: Now.

865
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:59,089
Speaker 0: I know I was really curious as to why going on wanted to kill Lupin early on.

866
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:01,938
Speaker 1: So there's more here, but it's not that important.

867
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just wanted to throw that out mostly because really we're plugging.

868
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,729
Speaker 0: We're not plugging them because they told us to but if you want to learn about anime anime world order is pretty cool.

869
00:59:11,271 --> 00:59:15,426
Speaker 0: Yep, they definitely catch us on all over because we're very fast and loose when it comes to.

870
00:59:15,446 --> 00:59:18,933
Speaker 0: I don't know everything Everything.

871
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:23,430
Speaker 1: I mean if you can pick two words to describe us it would be loose fast and fast loose.

872
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:29,562
Speaker 0: So anyway without further ado here is a collection of the short interviews.

873
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:35,244

Speaker 0: Dare you How do you do that like?

877
