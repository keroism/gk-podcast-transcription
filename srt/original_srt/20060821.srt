1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,333
Speaker 1: It's Monday August 21st, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,599
Speaker 1: We discuss podcasting live on the road.

3
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:18,756
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,602 --> 00:00:22,569
Speaker 1: You might notice I sound like my old self.

5
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:25,519
Speaker 1: That's because I finally have a brand new pop filter.

6
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:33,320
Speaker 1: It is made out of a nice black pantyhose some duct tape an embroidery loop a bent coat hanger.

7
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:35,705
Speaker 0: That's fantastic.

8
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,613
Speaker 0: It's exactly the same as the old one only new.

9
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:41,040
Speaker 1: not only does it look better It doesn't smell like tonsillolith.

10
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:42,864
Speaker 1: That is key.

11
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:43,928
Speaker 0: That is key.

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:44,410
Speaker 0: Good.

13
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:46,920
Speaker 1: God did that old pop filter smell like tonsillolith.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,276
Speaker 0: Well, you're always hacking up all kinds of nasty shit.

15
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:49,860
Speaker 0: Not surprised.

16
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:56,120
Speaker 1: I Submit that you were the only person I've ever seen who farted on a microphone and then immediately tried to talk on it.

17
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was.

18
00:00:57,288 --> 00:00:58,356
Speaker 0: I wasn't thinking ahead right there.

19
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:10,840
Speaker 1: No But actually today both Scott and I got caught in the same Traffic Jam despite the fact that he works about an hour to the east and I work about an hour to the south.

20
00:01:11,343 --> 00:01:17,711
Speaker 0: Well, we all come up to the same little east-west Interstate and then actually most days I don't most days.

21
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,416
Speaker 1: I take the Bear Mountain Beacon Expressway.

22
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:20,500
Speaker 0: Why didn't you?

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,090
Speaker 1: Because I just didn't good job.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,739
Speaker 1: I have three ways home and I kind of randomly pick one every day.

25
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,571
Speaker 0: Maybe you should listen to the traffic report before you randomly pick.

26
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:33,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what I looked on the MSN Microsoft Whatnot?

27
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:35,490
Speaker 0: traffic report that you know what.

28
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,500
Speaker 0: there is no internet traffic that works.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,937
Speaker 0: the only traffic that works is the local radio for where you are which sucks because you don't know the traffic of where you're Going if you're going a long distance.

30
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:57,300
Speaker 1: Yep I mean all the New York stations always say all the roads going into and out of New York City which would be good for me, but I Don't have time to sit like by the time the news would come on and they tell me about it.

31
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,922
Speaker 1: I'm already on whatever road I've committed to yeah And it's like.

32
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:05,880
Speaker 0: I know that there's sometimes an alternate route, but usually the alternate route is just out of the way.

33
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:10,395
Speaker 0: So you're either spending time sitting or spending an equal amount of time driving around.

34
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,580
Speaker 1: Well, here's the main problem.

35
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:26,017
Speaker 1: We were stuck five minutes from our house and our options were the i-84 which was completely stopped or the only other Road that goes east-west which had every other person in the world on it.

36
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:38,731
Speaker 1: Yep Good God I mean have you ever sat at a light and you're trying to turn left with a green arrow even and the green arrow comes On and traffic doesn't move at all because the cross street is full.

37
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:47,460
Speaker 1: and then the green arrow turns back to red and then five Minutes later goes green again, and then it goes red again and in all this time not a single car has moved.

38
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,629
Speaker 0: The thing is on that street.

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,940
Speaker 0: I think the lights are really just not optimal.

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,461
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is the lights are perfectly optimal unless all the traffic from i-84 tries to squeeze down route 52.

41
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:00,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're really like.

42
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:10,700
Speaker 0: I am in favor of there being traffic cameras You know that watch traffic and that there should be people watching them and manipulating lights and things when crazy shit happens.

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is there is cause for abuse of those traffic cameras, you know.

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:24,762
Speaker 1: Well, I note that New York City for the most part has traffic cameras everywhere and there have been pretty much no reports of them Being abused.

45
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean New York City.

46
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,660
Speaker 1: whenever the traffic gets bad police appear and direct the traffic.

47
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,300
Speaker 0: That is another good thing.

48
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,940
Speaker 0: And no, I didn't see a single cop directing any traffic.

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,442
Speaker 0: You know why?

50
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:36,848
Speaker 1: because it wasn't New York City.

51
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,720
Speaker 1: and I'm not gonna say that New York City is the greatest place in the world.

52
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:49,040
Speaker 1: But you know what whenever there's a problem in New York City Someone deals with it either a cop or a guy on the street someone deals with whatever situation is going down.

53
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:50,064
Speaker 0: Yeah out here.

54
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,751
Speaker 0: They just no one did anything.

55
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:53,598
Speaker 0: You just let the traffic sort itself out.

56
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:54,020
Speaker 0: Who cares?

57
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,204
Speaker 1: No, a few people did stuff.

58
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:58,820
Speaker 1: They cut me off trying to get one car ahead.

59
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, funny, yeah, it was great.

60
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,893
Speaker 1: Okay The best part was I cut down a side street and I drove around.

61
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:17,579
Speaker 1: I got stuck because there's another accident somewhere else And I was driving around trying to find a back road that would get me anywhere and I ended up driving up a one-way street and coming around and coming back to the road.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,334
Speaker 1: We were on exactly four cars ahead of Scott like ten minutes later.

63
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just driving around.

64
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,347
Speaker 0: I see a funny license plate.

65
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:25,736
Speaker 0: then I see another funny license.

66
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:33,080
Speaker 1: Oh, it's rim All right, yeah which started us arguing even more about car insurance.

67
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:39,174
Speaker 1: So if anyone has anything to say about car insurance traffic or indigent drivers I suggest you hit the phone.

68
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:39,680
Speaker 0: indignant.

69
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,587
Speaker 1: No indigent as in they don't have any money.

70
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,231
Speaker 1: not indignant.

71
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:45,596
Speaker 0: They're also indignant.

72
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:46,639
Speaker 1: some of them were.

73
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,005
Speaker 1: you know I have a story.

74
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,840
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna tell today about the most indignant woman I've ever met.

75
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're they're real.

76
00:04:52,325 --> 00:05:01,200
Speaker 1: one of my pet peeves lately is indignant people the people who just seem to have this Entitlement to everything in the world and they cut in front of you in a line or something.

77
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,608
Speaker 1: They're like it's more what I want.

78
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:03,472
Speaker 1: I do what I want.

79
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:04,840
Speaker 0: Well, it's not just that.

80
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,033
Speaker 0: It's also like you try to tell someone something.

81
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,099
Speaker 1: you're doing this just cuz I'm black.

82
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:12,900
Speaker 0: It's like when I'm trying to inform someone or help them out or teach them something.

83
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:21,392
Speaker 0: You're trying to tell me how to play Mario soccer Exactly, and then they get all upset like oh, you don't tell me what to do, you know It's like you're not the boss of me.

84
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:27,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly Yeah, all right God, I have so many stories about indignant people.

85
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,278
Speaker 0: Okay, so news time news time.

86
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:40,120
Speaker 1: Yep Well, it's Monday science day and all that and first off We're not gonna talk about this because we I know more about quantum physics than I do about astrophysics.

87
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,780
Speaker 0: I know it's almost nothing about quantum physics.

88
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:46,556
Speaker 1: Zero as I was about to say, I know practically nothing about quantum physics.

89
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,274
Speaker 1: ergo I am NOT qualified in any way to talk about this other than that.

90
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:55,554
Speaker 1: I understand the Implications at least from a broad perspective.

91
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:56,659
Speaker 0: So you read the article.

92
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:58,631
Speaker 1: No, no, I mean I understand that.

93
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,300
Speaker 0: so you didn't read the article.

94
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:09,238
Speaker 1: Understand that the fact that this has been for the most part confirmed will have far-reaching consequences And that is actually a big deal.

95
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:19,240
Speaker 1: Scientists have determined and they're sure at this point I mean, they've confirmed it as far as something like this can be confirmed that dark matter exists.

96
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:21,325
Speaker 0: All right, genius.

97
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:22,731
Speaker 0: What does that mean?

98
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,060
Speaker 0: Well the normal Joe on the street?

99
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:30,436
Speaker 1: Well for the normal Joe on the street it means that there's matter you can't detect so easily.

100
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:33,528
Speaker 1: that's out there Don't don't?

101
00:06:33,548 --> 00:06:36,300
Speaker 0: uh, is it gonna make a good basis for a sci-fi movie?

102
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,562
Speaker 0: Uh, you know what?

103
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,899
Speaker 1: There are already a whole bunch of sci-fi movies with dark matter.

104
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:41,184
Speaker 0: Awesome.

105
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,993
Speaker 0: So see sci-fi doesn't matter if it's real or not.

106
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:45,117
Speaker 1: It is ahead of the curve.

107
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:51,060
Speaker 1: I Mean the thing here is just that it won't affect anyone except scientists.

108
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:59,193
Speaker 1: But it really from what I've gathered from my reading kind of makes a bunch of the theories We've been tossing around a lot more solid.

109
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:03,960
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Does it mean we're gonna have spaceships that can take us far away very quickly?

110
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,779
Speaker 1: Actually, it means from what I can gather that that is actually more difficult than we expected now.

111
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:11,749
Speaker 0: So we don't like this.

112
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:12,734
Speaker 0: news is what you're saying.

113
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:13,799
Speaker 0: This is bad news.

114
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:18,459
Speaker 1: Well, it means that now we know that there's this matter out there.

115
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:25,180
Speaker 1: That's hard to detect if it's detectable at all in most cases and we can't seem to manipulate it or do anything with it.

116
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:28,839
Speaker 1: And it's in the way and we don't know what it is, but we know it's there now.

117
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:30,900
Speaker 0: So it's just bad news all around.

118
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,026
Speaker 1: I mean before we weren't sure if dark matter was there.

119
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:37,980
Speaker 1: dark matter was basically a fudge factor kind of thrown into equations.

120
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:39,543
Speaker 1: Now we know that.

121
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:41,149
Speaker 1: All right, there is actually something there.

122
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,514
Speaker 1: our math isn't wrong.

123
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:43,316
Speaker 1: There's just something there.

124
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:44,139
Speaker 1: We don't know much about.

125
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:47,219
Speaker 0: Do you can you say at all how we know?

126
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:51,223
Speaker 1: Not at all I can't.

127
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:54,696
Speaker 1: scientists did some sort of experiment and observe something.

128
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:59,894
Speaker 1: good job You're helpful, but I think that this is somewhat significant news.

129
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,179
Speaker 1: So I thought I would toss it out there.

130
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,979
Speaker 0: All right I have sort of a double news one old and one new.

131
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:15,055
Speaker 0: yeah, the old news which you may or may not know because it was like a week old is AOL released a bunch of search results on the internet so that everyone could look at them now.

132
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,801
Speaker 0: the way they did this is they Took.

133
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,513
Speaker 0: well not results, but searches, you know, like.

134
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:23,070
Speaker 0: so if you searched for food It would show up in the thing.

135
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,119
Speaker 0: They distributed the word searches for food.

136
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,070
Speaker 1: Someone is hungry who searches for the word food.

137
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,492
Speaker 1: What do you think?

138
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:29,817
Speaker 1: I'm gonna search for food.

139
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:31,767
Speaker 1: while you talk about your news I'll be Michael Godot here.

140
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:37,184
Speaker 0: All right, so AOL put all these search Queries on the internet.

141
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,600
Speaker 0: so, you know in case it was it's interesting to see what other people are searching for mostly porn.

142
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:47,880
Speaker 0: But they put them out and to make it anonymous they replaced every username with a number.

143
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,073
Speaker 1: Whoa, Yahoo looks really different from the last time.

144
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:58,420
Speaker 0: I went anyway, go on Yeah, so if you were happen to be user number five and your name was Joe They would replace the word Joe with the number five.

145
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:02,818
Speaker 0: So you knew that all the searches the number five or from the same person, but you didn't know who?

146
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,524
Speaker 0: This didn't work.

147
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:08,615
Speaker 0: So well because everyone was able to look and see.

148
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:16,214
Speaker 0: hey All of these were by the same person and then they looked at what the person searched for and they were able to figure out Who it was.

149
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:22,298
Speaker 0: So AOL got some flack for that, but the internet got mountains of comedy.

150
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:27,559
Speaker 1: Yes There was one case where it appears that a husband and wife were both cheating on each other.

151
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,555
Speaker 0: There was one the funniest one I saw.

152
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:39,759
Speaker 0: it was on something awful Which had which has a highlights a reel of sorts was one person from the same House was searching for.

153
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:44,799
Speaker 0: What do I do if my mother-in-law like grabbed my dick?

154
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,306
Speaker 0: and Then there were searches for the same house.

155
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,814
Speaker 0: Like I saw my mother-in-law grabbed my husband's dick.

156
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:53,085
Speaker 0: Whoa I saw.

157
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,580
Speaker 0: my mom grabbed my husband's dick not mother-in-law That would be all right.

158
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,480
Speaker 1: If you search for food one the top Google sponsored ad is a McDonald's snack wrap.

159
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,596
Speaker 1: Oh god, but Yahoo and Google have the exact same top three links.

160
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:06,580
Speaker 0: No, okay.

161
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:09,948
Speaker 0: So anyway, what happened today?

162
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,040
Speaker 0: is someone released a new Firefox extension called track me not.

163
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:19,420
Speaker 0: What track me not does is when you're not doing anything and Firefox is open.

164
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:24,498
Speaker 0: It just kind of does some searches on AOL Yahoo Google and MSN.

165
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:36,666
Speaker 0: So if anyone ever decides to release some search results or look through the search well search queries at either of those any of those Places then they'll say hey That's we don't know who.

166
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,479
Speaker 0: that is because there's so many crazy different searches going on all the time.

167
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:42,168
Speaker 1: Alright now I'm gonna put on my tinfoil hat here for a minute.

168
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:45,559
Speaker 1: And now let's assume that me being evil rim.

169
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:47,499
Speaker 1: Dr Chaos wrote this program.

170
00:10:48,422 --> 00:11:04,547
Speaker 1: Now I would set it up so that it would search occasionally for very specific things That would be tied to each person who has downloaded my program in some way so that I could still track Everything in the event that something like this happened.

171
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:05,670
Speaker 0: Yep, you could do that.

172
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,816
Speaker 0: However, there are two things in your way.

173
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:13,892
Speaker 0: number one With this extension you can actually customize how and what the thing searches.

174
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,757
Speaker 0: So that's number one.

175
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:23,018
Speaker 0: number two Anyone who's intelligent can configure it to search for certain things and then monitor it with.

176
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,751
Speaker 0: you know Ethereal or whatever they want to monitor right and they'll know if you're evil.

177
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,200
Speaker 1: now, I put on my ass hat hat.

178
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:34,600
Speaker 1: Alright, let's say I want to get revenge on someone and I'm a really bad person.

179
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:34,991
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

180
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:44,510
Speaker 1: I go to their computer and they probably use Firefox because if I'm a bad person, I'm probably dumb and as a result, I Probably hate someone who's smart who uses Firefox.

181
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,931
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

182
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:51,199
Speaker 1: So I install this plug-in somehow and I tell it to search for all this sorts of kitty porn stuff.

183
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,580
Speaker 0: You are the awesome.

184
00:11:55,461 --> 00:12:07,040
Speaker 0: The winner is you as you have found why Scott has not installed this extension, ah, yes Also because I am not so paranoid and I don't care if people see my search queries.

185
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to think is you know what I know?

186
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:10,316
Speaker 0: porn sites.

187
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,100
Speaker 0: I don't need to search for.

188
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:20,126
Speaker 1: If someone wanted to know your porn searchings, I guess they could look at our DNS But we don't even have a caching DNS.

189
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:22,294
Speaker 1: So now we can't nope.

190
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:23,920
Speaker 0: No, I tried to turn the caching on it.

191
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,643
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck to do.

192
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never bothered because it doesn't matter for us.

193
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:27,856
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,205
Speaker 0: Oh, well Yeah, it would be faster though.

195
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:30,968
Speaker 0: Maybe we should do it.

196
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I'll look into it.

197
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:33,556
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all you.

198
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:37,449
Speaker 1: All right Anyway, my news is something that isn't.

199
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:39,295
Speaker 0: wasn't your news the dark matter.

200
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:39,575
Speaker 0: No.

201
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:40,659
Speaker 1: No, I was just throwing that out.

202
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:41,946
Speaker 1: Okay I have an actual news.

203
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,196
Speaker 0: I want to turn the dark matter out.

204
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:48,127
Speaker 0: Oh, no You Know Iran's gonna nuke Israel tomorrow.

205
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, supposedly Iran's gonna nuke Israel.

206
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:57,320
Speaker 1: Oh, no hide under your desk I hate to say it, but if it happened, that means that the internet scooped Iran.

207
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:00,371
Speaker 0: Well some guy in the Wall Street Journal writing an op-ed.

208
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,314
Speaker 0: That was kind of crazy.

209
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:02,980
Speaker 1: Oh an op-ed.

210
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:08,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I can tell that this is barely news because it didn't even hit FARC.

211
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:12,175
Speaker 1: Yep I mean if something doesn't hit FARC it effectively didn't happen.

212
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:12,497
Speaker 0: Yep.

213
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:12,979
Speaker 0: Yep.

214
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:19,147
Speaker 1: Yep Alright, so this Irish company called Steer Ste o RN.

215
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:20,130
Speaker 1: I'm linking to their website.

216
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:28,568
Speaker 0: I think it's like storm but steorn That was the most useless Simile ever steorn.

217
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:35,930
Speaker 1: It's like Otakon, but it's pronounced Whatever.

218
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:38,340
Speaker 0: anyway Talk about the crazy company.

219
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:44,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, I said Otakon because I have the Otakon book in front of me and then I looked around for another word to say Yeah, anyone out there?

220
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:53,440
Speaker 0: I've heard a lot of people say like Otakon and Otakon Otakon you all need to STFU because it's Otakon Otakon.

221
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,940
Speaker 0: Yep, not Otakon this company.

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,620
Speaker 1: I'm linking to their website, but bear in mind that I'm only doing so in the most ironic sense.

223
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,599
Speaker 1: I'm linking to it solely so that you can make fun of this company.

224
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,331
Speaker 1: This is a real company at least it might be.

225
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:18,644
Speaker 1: it has recently come to my attention that a number of people Believe that this company is actually a viral marketing campaign for Halo 3

226
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:19,209
Speaker 0: could be and

227
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:25,287
Speaker 1: That is the most credible Theory I've heard so far because otherwise

228
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:25,908
Speaker 0: it

229
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:32,084
Speaker 1: means that this group of people who have put together this snazzy looking website and these nice Animations and all this stuff.

230
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,429
Speaker 0: It is a pretty snazzy website.

231
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,060
Speaker 0: Usually the scam idiot websites are much less.

232
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,200
Speaker 1: They tend to have many fonts and blinking red letters.

233
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:41,560
Speaker 0: It looked like myspace pages.

234
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:48,788
Speaker 1: The long story short is this company claims to have a perpetual motion machine and that they want to sell it to people Can't happen.

235
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,312
Speaker 0: Perpetual motion defies every law of nature.

236
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:53,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

237
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,759
Speaker 1: Now they even claim that our invention flies in the face of conventional understandings of physics.

238
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,104
Speaker 1: Yep, it does.

239
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:03,933
Speaker 0: Hey sure does which means it's not real.

240
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:04,635
Speaker 0: It's it's.

241
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:05,358
Speaker 0: it's made up.

242
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:05,799
Speaker 0: You know what?

243
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,023
Speaker 0: I Invented a dragon.

244
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,770
Speaker 0: I grew it in a in a in a my bathtub.

245
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:11,211
Speaker 1: Really.

246
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:11,773
Speaker 1: Can I ride it?

247
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:12,936
Speaker 0: No.

248
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:18,415
Speaker 0: Oh You can just invest in my company and then maybe one day I'll let you ride it.

249
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:19,760
Speaker 1: So I'll get to ride the dragon.

250
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:23,373
Speaker 0: No, it's prides dead already, but what I can make another one.

251
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:26,974
Speaker 0: if you invest enough money in my company We'll have to talk after the show.

252
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:32,300
Speaker 1: All right I like how we're making jokes today that are almost exactly like the jokes in the South Park.

253
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,263
Speaker 1: We just watched.

254
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:35,491
Speaker 0: are they really the thing with Butters?

255
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,353
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

256
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,260
Speaker 1: We just did that joke only with dragons.

257
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,275
Speaker 0: We did just do that joke.

258
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:40,859
Speaker 0: Good God.

259
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:46,113
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't have more to say about that other than that that that itself is not news.

260
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:50,356
Speaker 1: companies appear all the time with bullshit pseudo signs trying to sell it.

261
00:15:51,262 --> 00:16:01,918
Speaker 1: The scary part is that there were people on the internet who were posting about this company as though This is some amazing breakthrough and they're really excited about it.

262
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,860
Speaker 1: Yep, and I don't think they were kidding.

263
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:10,119
Speaker 0: So if it's true that it's a halo 3 thing then some of those people were there supporting it for sure.

264
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,172
Speaker 0: But there were definitely people.

265
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,480
Speaker 0: I saw the dig comments.

266
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:17,778
Speaker 0: They were people who believed it or didn't outright toss it out.

267
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,117
Speaker 1: god I got a gripe with dig and these stupid people who tend to use it.

268
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:34,400
Speaker 0: yes, so If you think there can be a perpetual emotion machine if you think that that is possible if you believe Anyone that who tells you that they have a perpetual emotion machine might not be lying.

269
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:36,720
Speaker 0: You are a doofus.

270
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:46,537
Speaker 1: yo things of the day.

271
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:51,180
Speaker 0: You didn't say thingy I didn't say anything.

272
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:57,283
Speaker 0: Also, that was our third take because because the second time I wanted to just say that I didn't have anything funny to say But you didn't like that.

273
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:57,986
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.

274
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,400
Speaker 1: so fuck you mainly because I thought you were saying that not ironically.

275
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,594
Speaker 0: No, I was saying it ironically.

276
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:14,519
Speaker 1: Oh Anyway, my thing of the day is something I've been kind of wanting to talk about for a bit and It's scary, but it's science related.

277
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:25,417
Speaker 1: There is a study done recently and the they asked a whole bunch of questions of people in generally industrialized nations And the main question they asked was essentially Did humans?

278
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,787
Speaker 1: Evolve from other species over time?

279
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:32,859
Speaker 1: something like that was basically a question to determine if you believe that evolution happened or not.

280
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:38,666
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and of all of these industrialized and semi industrialized nations They did.

281
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:47,060
Speaker 1: like 30 countries The United States was beaten only by Turkey in terms of not believing in evolution.

282
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:53,815
Speaker 0: So anyone who agrees with Certain people that Americans aren't stupid.

283
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:56,306
Speaker 0: You're wrong Americans are stupid.

284
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,380
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not even like it was close.

285
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:09,652
Speaker 1: America is at the bottom by far and pretty much every civilized country in the world has a very high Response rate to this question except the United States.

286
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:16,980
Speaker 0: and if you look at the top of the list You see the countries with the science and the making fancy things that had the better electronics.

287
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:21,480
Speaker 0: And at the bottom you see the countries with the Hicks and the religion.

288
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:29,550
Speaker 1: Well, let's see the winners here are Iceland Denmark Sweden, France, Japan, Britain, Norway, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Italy The Netherlands Hungary Luxembourg I could go on.

289
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,959
Speaker 0: so all the countries that enjoy f1 racing.

290
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:37,618
Speaker 0: Pretty much a correlation high-tech cars high-tech brain.

291
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:47,875
Speaker 1: The u.s was edged out by Cyprus just a little bit and Unfortunately Turkey is really really really way back there beyond the u.s Is pretty far beyond everyone else.

292
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:57,348
Speaker 0: Yeah It said I really would have liked if they would have added one or two like Developing countries a third world countries.

293
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,193
Speaker 0: Sorry politically correct you in.

294
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,159
Speaker 1: I would like to see China be asked to.

295
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,707
Speaker 0: yeah They gotta ask China.

296
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:03,733
Speaker 0: Did they ask Russia?

297
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:04,800
Speaker 1: I don't believe so.

298
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta ask China in Russia and maybe the Ukraine and you got a India - India.

299
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,474
Speaker 1: Well, they they asked like all like Lithuania and all that.

300
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:14,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

301
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,053
Speaker 0: That's fine But also I'd like to see like Afghanistan on there.

302
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:19,800
Speaker 1: Well, I'd like to see a more thorough study.

303
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely more in some African countries also.

304
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,239
Speaker 1: I think they could have asked a bunch more questions because they were basically saying did evolution happen or not?

305
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:38,680
Speaker 1: and The really smart answer is probably Not yes But I guess anyone who would say no is pretty much definitely not on the right page.

306
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:50,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, also, you know, they should have checked to see what people thought the theory of evolution was Because a lot of people just don't understand the theory of evolution and they only disbelieve Colin me a monkey.

307
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:54,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, you know, they don't believe in it because they don't know what it is.

308
00:19:54,794 --> 00:20:08,676
Speaker 1: I mean if I thought that Granted granted there was another study I'm not gonna link to this one But one of the questions that they asked were do you believe that humans share at least 50% of their DNA with?

309
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,790
Speaker 1: most Americans said no Even though the correct answer is like 90% like 99.

310
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we're almost identical to chimpanzees.

311
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,189
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, yeah.

312
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:26,349
Speaker 1: now once again Industrialized nations other than the US.

313
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,615
Speaker 1: this really isn't a problem.

314
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:31,399
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And all I want to say is that this really kind of frightens me.

315
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:36,240
Speaker 0: Anyone who says Americans aren't stupid you're wrong.

316
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,065
Speaker 1: Theoretically, they're not.

317
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,633
Speaker 1: this does not prove that they're stupid.

318
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:40,979
Speaker 1: It proves that they're ignorant.

319
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,085
Speaker 0: Ignorant and stupid is the same thing.

320
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:43,586
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

321
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,151
Speaker 1: ignorant means you lack knowledge.

322
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,840
Speaker 1: stupid means you lack the ability to deal with knowledge.

323
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,175
Speaker 0: There's a big difference whatever you want to define it.

324
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:55,044
Speaker 0: as I say Stupid is stupid is stupid.

325
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:57,009
Speaker 0: If you're not smart, you're stupid.

326
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,490
Speaker 0: There you go.

327
00:20:58,032 --> 00:20:59,115
Speaker 1: That was brilliant.

328
00:20:59,175 --> 00:20:59,556
Speaker 0: Yep.

329
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,511
Speaker 1: That was pros Scott I'm very proud of you.

330
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,116
Speaker 0: You know what it was?

331
00:21:03,961 --> 00:21:06,010
Speaker 0: It's stupid All right.

332
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,639
Speaker 1: What do you got?

333
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:13,160
Speaker 0: So I do this thing called cunu where I help people with problems with their computer.

334
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:17,273
Speaker 0: They just I am me kind of randomly and I help them cuz I'm not doing anything at work.

335
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:18,718
Speaker 1: how altruistic of you.

336
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:29,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, and one question that I've had to deal with two or three times in my life not just on cunu is how do I defrag my hard drive in Linux?

337
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:38,078
Speaker 0: and the answer is you don't have to and people go WTF?

338
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:43,299
Speaker 0: I need to defrag my hard drive and I'm like, no you don't and sometimes they just don't don't understand.

339
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:57,220
Speaker 0: and The answer is Linux file systems don't need to be defragmented pretty much ever Because they are not stupidly designed you see in Windows.

340
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,893
Speaker 0: Alright, let's let me try to talk about this in non-technical terms.

341
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,077
Speaker 1: Even though talk too long.

342
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:02,960
Speaker 1: It'll turn into a news.

343
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:09,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to do it on doing this on tech day because we don't give high tech enough stuff for you know And some people like it.

344
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,595
Speaker 0: So here you go.

345
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,444
Speaker 0: You have a hard drive.

346
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:20,639
Speaker 0: all that's on the hard drive is zeros and ones and they stay there as long as you keep them There it's a big magnetic disk that spins fast.

347
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:27,292
Speaker 0: If you want to put files on a hard drive You need to have some system of arranging the zeros and ones.

348
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:29,740
Speaker 1: Oh some kind of filing system.

349
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,920
Speaker 1: Maybe a file system a system for having files.

350
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:45,800
Speaker 0: Yes That is exactly what you need a file system a way to arrange the zeros and ones on the hard drive so that the computer Knows where the files are and where to find the files and which zeros and ones equal which file.

351
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:55,779
Speaker 1: Well, I think one place where a lot of the confusion around file systems comes from is that Windows doesn't differentiate between Formatting the drive and making the file system.

352
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,100
Speaker 1: Yep, so most people when they hear format they think it means something very different from what format means to the rest of the world exactly.

353
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:15,859
Speaker 0: But a file system is a way of arranging zeros and ones on a hard drive Usually a hard drive but any other storage like a flash card or anything so that the computer knows where the files are.

354
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:29,380
Speaker 0: now Windows traditionally uses fat which is not the greatest one and Windows 2000 and XP and the newer windows use NTFS, which is super fat basically super duper fat.

355
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,208
Speaker 1: It's actually quite a bit different.

356
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:34,740
Speaker 0: It is quite a bit different, but it still needs defragmentation.

357
00:23:35,222 --> 00:23:37,793
Speaker 1: It has the same problems for different reasons exactly.

358
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:38,717
Speaker 1: That's the best way to put it.

359
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,600
Speaker 0: Yes Linux can use pretty much any file system in the universe except NTFS.

360
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,367
Speaker 0: Well, no now it can use NTFS.

361
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:47,833
Speaker 0: They found a way really writing.

362
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:48,255
Speaker 1: Yep.

363
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:48,998
Speaker 1: Is it safe?

364
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:52,849
Speaker 0: Yep They uses a Windows driver, oh great.

365
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:55,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's hard to get it to work, but it works.

366
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not worth it.

367
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,660
Speaker 0: I saw it's not what I wouldn't personally go through the effort, but if you need to do it, it's there.

368
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:08,120
Speaker 1: But the last time I tried to write to NTFS in Linux it involved you can only write the same number of bytes.

369
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:10,446
Speaker 0: Now you can do it full-on.

370
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:13,978
Speaker 0: But all right in Linux there the standard file system is ext2.

371
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,734
Speaker 0: There's also ext3 which is what everyone uses these days.

372
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:22,146
Speaker 0: There's also riser FS riser4 XFS, JFS.

373
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:30,219
Speaker 0: There's lots of different file systems to choose from and they all have advantages and disadvantages But none of the ones that are awesome for Linux.

374
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:44,720
Speaker 0: I mean you could use fat in Linux and then you need to defrag it But all the Linux ones do not need to be defragmented Now if you're not sure what defragmenting means and you want to know why Linux file systems don't need to be defragmented.

375
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:50,037
Speaker 0: My thing of the day explains it in a way where any idiot can understand.

376
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:50,820
Speaker 0: Well, not any idiot.

377
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,228
Speaker 1: I was about to say any idiot.

378
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,053
Speaker 1: I got some idiots.

379
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:58,213
Speaker 0: No any Literate and moderately intelligent human being can understand.

380
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:04,411
Speaker 0: so an IQ above 90 Yeah You'll be able to understand files at the general gist of you.

381
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:12,620
Speaker 1: put the files on the disk get in Get in Yep.

382
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:23,020
Speaker 0: So I think that if you want to understand a little bit more about how your computer works What defragmenting means and why Windows sucks?

383
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,455
Speaker 1: You should read this page now for those of you who listen regularly.

384
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:36,264
Speaker 1: last week last Monday In fact, we played the panel that we recorded somewhat drugged somewhat tired myself mostly hungover at Otacon.

385
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:52,209
Speaker 1: it was our second live recorded panel at a convention and Today we decided since we did have a lot of difficulty pulling this all off that we would talk a bit about the trials and tribulations of trying to do podcasts live on the road.

386
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:58,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I think this is actually gonna be good because I don't think anyone else has done a podcast about doing this.

387
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:04,229
Speaker 1: Yeah now, I mean, it's something we've done and it's actually really easy to do.

388
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,843
Speaker 1: The problem is it's easy to do.

389
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:10,117
Speaker 1: as long as nothing goes wrong Something will always go wrong.

390
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:13,750
Speaker 0: if you ever do anything live in your entire life something will go wrong.

391
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:19,373
Speaker 1: The fact is if you don't prepare for everything to go wrong, you're completely dick before you even started Exactly.

392
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:24,810
Speaker 0: And as we said in our panel many many times money makes everything better.

393
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:31,570
Speaker 1: Yes hire sound engineers and a full crew and they'll set you up a rig everywhere you go and you want to deal with anything.

394
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,569
Speaker 0: This is why concerts don't screw up because they have money.

395
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:42,686
Speaker 1: Alright, I guess we could talk about Tora Khan first because that was a much easier one and then Oda Khan was when we jumped To using other people's equipment.

396
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:51,030
Speaker 1: Yep Now for Tora Khan, we basically just brought Scott's laptop the mixer the compressor and three microphones.

397
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,743
Speaker 1: We plugged them all in we hit record on audacity.

398
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:55,069
Speaker 1: We turned around and we did the panel.

399
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,436
Speaker 0: Gee, that was hard.

400
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:00,730
Speaker 1: Well, it was basically the same as doing our normal podcast.

401
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:10,450
Speaker 1: The only difference was that we were in a different place We were using a different computer with a shittier sound card and there were other people watching gasp.

402
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,962
Speaker 1: Now the reason this wasn't difficult that one.

403
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,728
Speaker 1: it was a small room and two.

404
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,980
Speaker 1: more importantly We weren't doing anything else with the audio.

405
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,425
Speaker 1: We didn't have monitors.

406
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,830
Speaker 1: We weren't wearing headphones.

407
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:26,562
Speaker 1: We didn't have amplified speakers projecting our voices out to the crowd.

408
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:29,430
Speaker 1: The only equipment we needed was recording equipment.

409
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:36,624
Speaker 1: So if you ever do a small panel and you're a podcaster just bring your entire Podcasting rig set it up in the room and go.

410
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:37,409
Speaker 1: that's all you need to do.

411
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:52,870
Speaker 0: And of course if you can't bring your entire podcasting rig because it's big or you don't have a laptop or anything like that You can a buy small equipment Because all you need you need microphones you need mixing and you need recording.

412
00:27:53,192 --> 00:28:02,992
Speaker 0: So buy the smallest things you can buy that do all that - You can borrow say a oh and now you're saying - Perfect.

413
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:06,628
Speaker 0: Great be you can borrow someone else's shit.

414
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:15,292
Speaker 0: so like if you're going to a college you can call someone there and say we need you to bring a laptop to our panel and Hopefully they won't.

415
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:18,966
Speaker 0: you know drop out on you as people are want to do

416
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:35,930
Speaker 1: Now, of course that isn't the difficult part other than you know The actual logistics of running the panel and public speaking and everything that we really don't want to get into today because today is tech Day, but rest assured we're going to do a show sometime soon on the public speaking and presentation aspects of all this.

417
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:40,086
Speaker 0: Yep, you know, we'll do an episode called like how to run a panel that doesn't suck.

418
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:40,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

419
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:41,733
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sounds good.

420
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:49,745
Speaker 1: Now the remember in the forums write that down will forget Yes, but anyway the panel that we did at Otacon was very different one.

421
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:52,674
Speaker 1: There's a very large room Very large.

422
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:52,875
Speaker 0: Yes.

423
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:55,707
Speaker 1: I mean large larger than we wanted at all.

424
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,800
Speaker 1: Exactly - there was already equipment in the room.

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,350
Speaker 1: Otacon had already set up this whole AV setup where there are microphones everywhere.

426
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:05,742
Speaker 1: They were all put into this crazy equipment.

427
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:15,850
Speaker 1: Everything was amplified so we talked into the microphones and the speakers then project it out into the room and As a result we had to somehow integrate our equipment with their equipment.

428
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:32,060
Speaker 1: Now if you don't have a mixer or you're a solo podcaster Or you don't have any audio skill whatsoever There is really almost no way you're going to be able to deal with this unless the AV people are very nice to you And they have a bunch of cables and they'll help you out.

429
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:33,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, not likely.

430
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:39,957
Speaker 0: I mean our guy did the minimal effort for us and that's because he knew what to ask for and we were asking for very Little.

431
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:43,078
Speaker 1: Yep I mean we basically asked can we record the panel?

432
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:48,435
Speaker 1: and the guy seemed to think that we wanted him to do it all and They were like, no, we have a mixer.

433
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:51,928
Speaker 1: We just need one mono feed from your stuff.

434
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:52,410
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

435
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,287
Speaker 1: And he said, oh, okay, and he plugged into our mixer.

436
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:56,152
Speaker 0: Yep He gave us.

437
00:29:56,172 --> 00:30:00,730
Speaker 0: the only need is a wire that came from his stuff to our stuff one wire.

438
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:15,292
Speaker 1: of course the equipment didn't work so behind us talking was a Kind of noise Yeah, but that was somewhat removed.

439
00:30:15,453 --> 00:30:17,640
Speaker 1: Well, luckily that didn't affect the actual panel.

440
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,780
Speaker 1: I mean remember there are two concerns you have when you're doing this sort of panel.

441
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,140
Speaker 1: Firstly you have to worry about the panel itself.

442
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,508
Speaker 1: This should be your primary concern.

443
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:30,480
Speaker 1: if you're going to screw anything up You're much better off screwing up the recording part than the presentation part.

444
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:39,860
Speaker 0: absolutely, if you have to if you're it's time for your panel to start start if it's time for your panel to end and You should be there early to deal with all your audio shit.

445
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,665
Speaker 0: If you don't start get your recording set up and working before the panel starts Start forget it.

446
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:48,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, give up on it because the recording isn't worth it.

447
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:52,274
Speaker 1: not doing the recording doesn't lose you anything It's just a small opportunity cost.

448
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:52,596
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

449
00:30:53,261 --> 00:31:00,371
Speaker 1: Wasting the first half hour of your panel trying to fix that hum That won't even matter until you're trying to do post-production.

450
00:31:00,411 --> 00:31:02,960
Speaker 1: Later is definitely not worth your time.

451
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:04,858
Speaker 0: No, you just destroyed half your panel.

452
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,172
Speaker 0: now No one's gonna be at it.

453
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:06,819
Speaker 0: Good job.

454
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:10,331
Speaker 1: And also when we say get there early we mean get there early.

455
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,900
Speaker 1: we got to our panel an hour before it started.

456
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:14,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't have to get there that early.

457
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:17,140
Speaker 0: We probably could have gotten there a half hour before it started.

458
00:31:17,523 --> 00:31:18,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we were.

459
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:18,772
Speaker 1: more is safer.

460
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,397
Speaker 0: I mean there is a point at which getting there earlier is stupid like two hours early.

461
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:23,880
Speaker 0: You'd be dumb.

462
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:25,220
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what you're doing.

463
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,060
Speaker 1: I mean if you're setting up all of the audio for the room then yeah get there two hours.

464
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:32,240
Speaker 0: Oh, you probably need like three or four hours depending on the room and the equipment.

465
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:36,780
Speaker 0: Good thing those guys had semi good equipment already set up except for the mixer with the Wii U.

466
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,631
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that wasn't that guy's fault.

467
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,294
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

468
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:41,460
Speaker 0: that was the bad equipment.

469
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:43,267
Speaker 0: One piece of the equipment was broken.

470
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:44,251
Speaker 0: Everything else is awesome.

471
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:46,380
Speaker 0: He had all these compressors lined up and everything.

472
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:55,509
Speaker 1: Yep In fact, I used our compressor as a limiter instead of a compressor because I was worried that the super loudness coming out of his Equipment could hurt the Mac.

473
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:57,400
Speaker 1: So I made the compressor be a limiter.

474
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,811
Speaker 1: So if anything got really loud, it would cut off the signal and save the Mac.

475
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:03,058
Speaker 1: Yep, and it worked worked very well.

476
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:03,479
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

477
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,493
Speaker 1: Now if you have extra equipment, you should bring it.

478
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:09,440
Speaker 1: if you don't have extra equipment, you should buy it.

479
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:18,979
Speaker 1: You should probably have one of every possible connector and then one of every possible connector again And then a whole bunch of cables that can connect between all of them.

480
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:26,690
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz you're never gonna know what they're gonna give you or what you're gonna have Available at the time or what you'll need or what.

481
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,460
Speaker 1: if suddenly you want to play some music at a panel you just patch right?

482
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,309
Speaker 0: In yeah, it's like you never know what you're gonna need.

483
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,262
Speaker 0: So bring everything you got, you know, a lot of people, you know They bring.

484
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:43,009
Speaker 0: you know trying to save space exactly what they think they'll need nothing more nothing less and inevitably one wire They need.

485
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:50,720
Speaker 0: you know It's better to have five or two ten wires sitting in your box unused than to not have the one wire you desperately need.

486
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:54,324
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean we brought Everything we had.

487
00:32:54,384 --> 00:32:55,246
Speaker 1: we brought the Mac.

488
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,514
Speaker 1: We brought Scott's laptop just in case.

489
00:32:57,814 --> 00:33:04,779
Speaker 1: we brought all of the podcasting equipment Every spare cable we have including a bunch of AV cables that we probably would not even need.

490
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:06,646
Speaker 0: Yep, we brought it all.

491
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,379
Speaker 1: it was way too much and we didn't even use a quarter of it.

492
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,409
Speaker 1: But having it saved us from all sorts of trouble.

493
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:20,131
Speaker 0: and if you really really really can't deal with Bringing a lot of physical goods with you wherever you're going.

494
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:25,125
Speaker 0: Your only option is really to buy smaller stuff Or to plan ahead.

495
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:34,240
Speaker 1: the problem is that the planning head one probably won't work because you can't plan for unexpected eventualities Yep, and two it probably won't work because you're gonna forget something anyway.

496
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:39,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, and a lot of what it comes down to is just you have to know your shit.

497
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:43,600
Speaker 0: that way You know when you get there no matter what the weird situation is.

498
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:49,400
Speaker 0: You have to know enough that you can comprehend the situation and come up with the solution rather quickly.

499
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Speaker 0: I mean if you just don't know then you're gonna waste a lot of time figuring it out and that's not good.

500
00:33:56,162 --> 00:34:00,178
Speaker 0: That's really not good because you need that time to implement the solution not to figure it out.

501
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:07,080
Speaker 1: Yes Now in terms of podcasting on the road we bought a Mac mini pretty much expressly for this purpose.

502
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:10,838
Speaker 0: Well, we originally bought it to replace your computer, but it failed miserably.

503
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,264
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, something like that.

504
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:15,360
Speaker 1: But now it serves as our media box and as our podcast box.

505
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:15,782
Speaker 1: Yep.

506
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:18,659
Speaker 1: Now the key is you've got to have some sort of portable rig.

507
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,802
Speaker 0: You really don't want to be bringing your own computer on the road unless you're like one of those wicked cool shuttle case land PC People.

508
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:34,900
Speaker 1: yeah, or if you have a really good laptop a really good laptop though Laptops without external sound cards tend to sound pretty bad and tend to be really noise.

509
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,656
Speaker 0: Well, I think the Mac laptops some at least they're supposedly have good sound cards But like my IBM ThinkPad has like the worst sound card imagine.

510
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:43,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, good God.

511
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:43,982
Speaker 0: Yeah.

512
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:46,576
Speaker 1: now in terms of having the computer, I mean the Mac mini is great.

513
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:47,797
Speaker 1: if you can get a laptop It's good.

514
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:51,580
Speaker 1: If you ever you fancy your best bet is to buy a solid-state recorder.

515
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:57,179
Speaker 1: But a good solid-state recorder will go for at least two to three hundred dollars Could even go for more than that.

516
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,996
Speaker 0: But a lot of the professional guys have a solid-state recorder that they use for everything.

517
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:08,160
Speaker 0: as the ultimate backup You know you have to get one of those ones that has like the XLR inputs and the compact flash card.

518
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:12,740
Speaker 0: And you know, these things are really awesome, you know, so they are worth the money they charge.

519
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,286
Speaker 0: You just can't get one if you're poor.

520
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:18,300
Speaker 1: and the other big concern in regards to bringing equipment is the display.

521
00:35:19,141 --> 00:35:24,180
Speaker 1: Now we were going to buy a cheap LCD monitor and we didn't get around to it for various reasons.

522
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,000
Speaker 1: So we ended up bringing one of Scott's really nice LCD monitors.

523
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:30,063
Speaker 1: If you don't have a laptop You've got.

524
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:35,400
Speaker 1: don't just assume that wherever you're going is gonna have something you can plug your computer into because they probably won't.

525
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:42,640
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the room we were in did have a Projector and there was a VGA cable that we could plug into to use that projector as a monitor.

526
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:52,248
Speaker 0: the thing was is The Mac mini only had DVI out and we didn't bring the DVI to VGA adapter But that's okay because we brought a DVI monitor.

527
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:54,756
Speaker 1: Well, there was also the RCA we could have used.

528
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:56,703
Speaker 0: there was the RCA We could have used.

529
00:35:56,743 --> 00:36:00,843
Speaker 1: yes, but the thing is if even if you think oh, I know they're gonna have a projector I'll just use that.

530
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:11,240
Speaker 1: I don't think I have ever been to a presentation Where the projector didn't somehow screw up while they were trying to set it up with a computer.

531
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:19,320
Speaker 0: See a lot of the thing is is I mark all of the 90% of those I mark down to people not knowing how to use audio-visual equipment.

532
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:20,505
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, definitely.

533
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:24,360
Speaker 0: You need to know how to use audio-visual equipment needs to know how to wire it.

534
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,453
Speaker 0: You need to know how to you know change settings on it.

535
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:29,040
Speaker 0: You need to know how to change inputs.

536
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:36,708
Speaker 0: You need to know how to do all those things and you need to be able to figure out how to do it on Completely foreign equipment that you've never used before.

537
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:43,893
Speaker 1: thus in the very least once again get to your panel early Plug your equipment in look at it.

538
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:48,779
Speaker 1: Make sure it's working Now right along those lines.

539
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:57,779
Speaker 1: You if you think you're gonna use the projector bear in mind that now while you're talking you're gonna have this Audacity window open in the background distracting everyone.

540
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:06,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, you probably want to like, you know Turn the project if you're using the projector you want to write want to turn it on hit record then turn the projector off You know.

541
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:11,129
Speaker 0: and then when you're done turn the projector back on and click stop Of course, then now you can't monitor if anything goes wrong.

542
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:18,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is sort of imagine doing a four-hour Roundtable panel discussion ending it round of applause.

543
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:24,870
Speaker 1: you turn the projector on to save it and oh there was a Fatal exception or a beach ball, huh?

544
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:25,773
Speaker 0: Good job.

545
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,194
Speaker 0: Great.

546
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:27,117
Speaker 1: Good game grenade.

547
00:37:27,138 --> 00:37:32,753
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, having a monitor or using a laptop is definitely a good idea.

548
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:37,005
Speaker 0: I mean I was really worried about bringing the monitor And it was.

549
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:44,697
Speaker 0: it was sort of a pain in the ass to bring the monitor But in the end it was worth it because pain in the ass my ass I had everything else.

550
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:45,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fun.

551
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:55,539
Speaker 1: now the other thing that really saved us and I'm glad we did it and we're going to do this at every panel we ever do ever is having an assistant.

552
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:05,200
Speaker 1: if There are two people in your podcast and you're trying to do a presentation Neither of you should be touching anything or doing anything other than talking.

553
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:13,500
Speaker 1: You should have a third person who's sitting back there fiddling with the computer the whole time when you're taking questions You should have a third person going around with the microphone.

554
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:19,560
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean imagine if I was doing this podcast right now and I had to spend all my you know half my time.

555
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:26,139
Speaker 0: My attention is focused on this screen to see if things are fucking up and the other half the time I'm focused on what I'm saying.

556
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:33,558
Speaker 0: That's not gonna be too good because I'm not paying attention to what I'm saying And I'm only giving the audience half of what I should be giving them now.

557
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,371
Speaker 1: granted I'm doing that right now and every night on geek nights.

558
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:40,132
Speaker 1: I'm watching all sorts of things while we talk But it's one meter over there.

559
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:40,535
Speaker 0: What are you?

560
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:41,280
Speaker 1: two more meters?

561
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,080
Speaker 1: I just can't see him now because I can't put my microphone where I want to until I get a better microphone.

562
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:47,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, those meters don't change so much.

563
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:49,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I gotta keep an eye on the inputs.

564
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:50,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

565
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:53,738
Speaker 1: it was much more important early on before we learned how to use microphones.

566
00:38:53,979 --> 00:39:01,665
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah But that sort of thing takes a lot of practice and even then it is distracting and whenever I get on a roll I stop watching.

567
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:02,067
Speaker 1: usually.

568
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:08,996
Speaker 0: yeah, but having an assistant is awesome Especially you just tell them what to look for and then if there's a problem they can signal you.

569
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:16,580
Speaker 0: and it's even better if they Can deal with the problem on their own and you don't need to do anything Yep, which our assistant could because it was in fact Nuri from the artist Ali podcast.

570
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:18,617
Speaker 1: So she knew exactly what she was doing.

571
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,440
Speaker 0: awesome.

572
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:24,159
Speaker 1: Now a whole bunch of other random things that you might may or may not be aware of.

573
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:24,822
Speaker 1: That.

574
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:40,547
Speaker 1: for example say you're doing a panel you're talking or you're on a stage you're talking You've got a microphone and there's speakers going out to the audience, you know, the big concert speakers the big black boxes that make noise don't ever walk in front of one of those.

575
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:49,475
Speaker 1: if you were carrying a microphone unless the microphone is switched to off and even then Don't walk in front of it because it's like a loaded weapon.

576
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:50,479
Speaker 1: It might be on.

577
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:51,383
Speaker 0: Yep, you got it.

578
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:56,200
Speaker 0: If you're about to walk in front of them, just stop look at your microphone, you know.

579
00:39:56,421 --> 00:40:03,274
Speaker 0: Double-check like a hundred times to make sure it's off Run across really fast and then turn the microphone on or better chart out.

580
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:06,049
Speaker 1: what you're going to do is that you never have to Walk in front of those things.

581
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:11,489
Speaker 0: That's also a good idea If you can just walk around the back You know with your microphone get a cordless one.

582
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:14,160
Speaker 0: that way you don't need to worry about wires getting tangled when you do that.

583
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:20,748
Speaker 1: Yep In fact at our panel we were careful about that and then when we brought up all the other Podcasts just they could give little plugs about themselves.

584
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,240
Speaker 1: We warned them don't walk in front of the microphone in front of you.

585
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:33,320
Speaker 0: All this in last Monday's episode, but yeah, yeah There's a point at which someone walks in front of those speakers and it for only like a half a second.

586
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,239
Speaker 0: We were like goddamn you ruined the perfectness.

587
00:40:36,363 --> 00:40:52,800
Speaker 1: now another thing you might not realize is that being I mean if anyone's ever been in theater or in a band in high school or Anything where you're on a stage where you're lighted where your mics where there are monitor speakers Anything beyond just sitting at a panel room in front of a bunch of people?

588
00:40:54,103 --> 00:41:09,720
Speaker 1: You might not be aware that You're not going to be able to hear the audience very well in many cases unless the acoustics in the room are good or the monitors are set up right and You're probably going to have to deal with hearing your own voice coming out of the speakers at a possibly substantial delay.

589
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:15,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the room we were in was really big and we had a bunch of people there But not enough to fill the room.

590
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:24,385
Speaker 0: so there was this echo of the speakers bouncing off the far wall back to us and it was rather annoying and People talking to us.

591
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:28,299
Speaker 0: They weren't physically close enough for us to hear them because they weren't as loud as I am.

592
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:37,820
Speaker 0: So when they talked it came out of the speakers that were facing away from us Bounced off the rear of the room and then came back to us so we couldn't tell what the hell they were asking.

593
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:51,580
Speaker 1: Now the ways to mitigate this are one to have your assistant repeat questions to you, which worked wonderfully to to Be very good at reading lips and guessing what people are asking which at a panel that's kind of rudimentary.

594
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,060
Speaker 1: We were talking about podcasting on a very basic level.

595
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,772
Speaker 1: It was usually pretty easy to guess what people are saying.

596
00:41:57,812 --> 00:42:01,226
Speaker 1: if you picked up one or two of the words they said Yep, first there's one point.

597
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:04,217
Speaker 1: I misjudged what someone was asking and answered a different question.

598
00:42:04,618 --> 00:42:05,060
Speaker 0: That's fine.

599
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:08,512
Speaker 0: More information is always better, but it's not just audio.

600
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:14,820
Speaker 1: if you're on a stage like a real stage You got to realize that those lights are going to be extremely hot and they're going to blind you.

601
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:17,659
Speaker 1: You won't be able to see anything and your eyes will hurt.

602
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a professional you don't.

603
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:24,700
Speaker 0: generally you keep your eyes low and you furrow your brow and you know all kinds of things.

604
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:24,841
Speaker 0: Yeah,

605
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:36,820
Speaker 1: I mean your best bet is either to read up on you know theater and stage and these sort of things and learn how to deal with all this stuff like the way the professionals do or Just do this a lot and honestly you'll get used to it real quick.

606
00:42:37,151 --> 00:42:42,509
Speaker 1: Yeah As long as you try and you realize that These are problems everyone faces and you just have to overcome them.

607
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:50,659
Speaker 1: and I guess one other thing since we're kind of cobbling this episode Together somewhat half-assed Lee cobble cobble if you couldn't tell yeah, is that?

608
00:42:51,460 --> 00:43:15,120
Speaker 1: Microphone discipline is is very important in a podcast But it's even more important live in many ways because at least when you're podcasting normally I hope that you've either got some sort of lavalier or else you've got the microphone either on a stand Or you hold it the same way every time you've got the pop filter Whatever you're using but it's very easy in your studio or at your desk to use the microphone consistently.

609
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:24,417
Speaker 1: If you're not using the microphone consistently when you're recording normally You probably shouldn't be on the road trying to record anything just yet because you're not quite there.

610
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:45,980
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but anyway When you're doing a show live and I hate to make fun of Scott for this But I crack up every time I see the pictures from torque on You've got to be very aware of the microphone because if you're not used to using a microphone in front of a crowd It's very easy to move the microphone around a lot Which isn't always a big deal because a lot of times they'll use omni mics for this purpose.

611
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:54,148
Speaker 1: But more importantly in terms of how you look you might hold the microphone right in front of your face Like Scott did so.

612
00:43:54,188 --> 00:44:01,777
Speaker 1: all the pictures of the panel show Scott standing there Holding his hand directly in front of his face with the microphone kind of blocking everything.

613
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:02,620
Speaker 0: I'm hip-hopping.

614
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're hip-hopping non-stop rocking.

615
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,396
Speaker 1: I Bit the head off a dove in the tunnel of love.

616
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:10,920
Speaker 0: All right

617
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:26,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're gonna do a live thing and you've never done this sort of thing before just do this alone and don't feel Embarrassed but go into your bathroom Hold the microphone and kind of pose with it move it around and try to find a way to hold it.

618
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:34,059
Speaker 0: That looks like all those people on TV look Yeah, and also, you know You also you can't take it too far away from your face because then it won't work.

619
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,719
Speaker 0: Your mouth your noise won't go in the noise hole.

620
00:44:38,361 --> 00:44:39,183
Speaker 1: Now either.

621
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:43,395
Speaker 1: you can either you know, basically pick where you're going to hold the microphone.

622
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:49,755
Speaker 1: then before the panel Figure out all your levels based on that and then hold the microphone.

623
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:51,280
Speaker 1: that far away come hell.

624
00:44:53,221 --> 00:45:03,879
Speaker 1: Now advanced techniques which really only apply mostly to vocalists and singers are that you can change the distance of the microphone Depending on what you're doing in order to act as your own gain.

625
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:06,660
Speaker 1: You know if you're yelling you put the microphone further away.

626
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,439
Speaker 1: If you're trying to do some sort of sensuous voice you pull it right up close and deep mic it.

627
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:13,546
Speaker 1: You move it around based on what you're doing.

628
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:15,212
Speaker 1: If none of that made sense.

629
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:16,155
Speaker 1: Don't try it.

630
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:17,780
Speaker 1: Just hold the microphone consistently.

631
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,566
Speaker 1: It's like bowling.

632
00:45:18,948 --> 00:45:25,680
Speaker 1: you can do all the fancy stuff in bowling But for the intermediate and beginner skill level the best thing you can do is to be consistent.

633
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:28,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, throw the ball straight down the middle of the lane every time.

634
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:39,378
Speaker 1: Yeah at least throw it the same way every time even if it goes into the gutter every time as Long as you're throwing it the exact same way Then you'll be able to make simple changes to what you're doing.

635
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:50,240
Speaker 1: to hit For example, if you always throw the bowling ball and it always hits the pin on the far left and nothing else Take one step to the right and throw it the exact same way and now you're gonna get a strike.

636
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:52,299
Speaker 1: Maybe or at least you'll do better.

637
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:58,479
Speaker 1: Yep, if you hold the microphone the exact same way, then the next time you record you'll know kind of where to put the levels.

638
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,532
Speaker 1: Mmm, I mean in general Scott seems to be done with his episodes.

639
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've resorted to gin mode.

640
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:13,728
Speaker 1: Granted I do that fairly often on the show.

641
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:14,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do.

642
00:46:15,193 --> 00:46:20,338
Speaker 1: the basic advice we have is very simply Practice prepare and or spend money.

643
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:26,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, prepare is always number one because even if you set your Bill Gates without that prepare part, you're fucked.

644
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:35,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you can hire all the assistants in the world But they can't actually say what you want to say unless you hire them to do the entire podcast for you.

645
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:45,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like imagine if Steve Jobs died and you had to do his keynote tomorrow Even if you had all his mad bunnies and resources, you wouldn't pull it off without the preparing.

646
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:48,718
Speaker 1: It depends on who you are and what you're good at it does.

647
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:51,275
Speaker 0: but I mean I guess you have to know what the hell you're gonna be introducing.

648
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:56,420
Speaker 1: true But a little bit of optimism for all of you out there because I know a lot of people are new at podcasting.

649
00:46:57,483 --> 00:47:10,420
Speaker 1: If you just do this constantly It's amazing how good you'll get at it and how quickly you'll get better at it Provided you try at least a little and you listen to what you're doing and try to make changes.

650
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,231
Speaker 1: I mean if you record your first panel and The audio sounds like this out undo that.

651
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:17,596
Speaker 1: Maybe you'll learn that.

652
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:18,840
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to turn my gain down.

653
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:20,419
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta hold the mic further away.

654
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:31,394
Speaker 1: And actually I'll say now that What you just heard probably didn't sound nearly as bad to you as it did to Scott and I because we listen to the raw Audio, but what you hear goes through the compressor and the limiter.

655
00:47:31,554 --> 00:47:32,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, that really hurt.

656
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:37,120
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, that's because you have those weird microphone or those weird headphones that you can't adjust so easily.

657
00:47:37,582 --> 00:47:38,807
Speaker 0: I can adjust them just fine.

658
00:47:38,848 --> 00:47:40,495
Speaker 0: They were worth the 20 bucks I paid.

659
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:51,729
Speaker 1: Yeah But just keep trying practice learn prepare Prepare get to things early buy equipment Don't suck.

660
00:47:52,378 --> 00:47:56,060
Speaker 1: Yeah Now, well, I mean we just really talked about the technology.

661
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,537
Speaker 1: We kind of padded this episode out because there wasn't so much to say about it.

662
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:02,629
Speaker 0: I Guaranteed I wanted to talk about bit torrent, but no.

663
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:03,372
Speaker 1: Yeah.

664
00:48:03,412 --> 00:48:06,162
Speaker 1: Well, the problem was we already said we were gonna do this show All right.

665
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,991
Speaker 0: Well next week, we'll talk about bit torrent.

666
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:14,499
Speaker 1: Yep, and then in the future some Thursday We're definitely gonna talk about presentation skills in general, you know how to speak what to say how to do it.

667
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:27,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, well probably another completely separate episode on Small weak solid-state recorders and how to do interviews on the road Which I realized now it was probably a better show to do because I have a lot more to say about that.

668
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:29,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just don't know.

669
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:33,740
Speaker 0: I think we don't know a lot about the different like specific devices and their features.

670
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,846
Speaker 0: We have to research that a bit.

671
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:35,007
Speaker 1: Yeah.

672
00:48:35,027 --> 00:48:36,415
Speaker 1: Well, I know a lot about the techniques.

673
00:48:36,616 --> 00:48:36,858
Speaker 0: Yep.

674
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,685
Speaker 1: Yep I think we're good for today.

675
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:41,677
Speaker 1: tune in tomorrow when we'll be talking about something very fun.

676
00:48:41,697 --> 00:48:43,925
Speaker 1: Oh Do you want to ruin it?

677
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:44,509
Speaker 1: You want to tell them?

678
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:45,756
Speaker 0: No, no, we'll let it be.

679
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:50,108
Speaker 1: All right All I have to say is that There might be some kobolds.

680
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:52,636
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, and there might be some babies.

681
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:55,741
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, and We might be having some dinner.

682
00:48:56,262 --> 00:49:06,510
