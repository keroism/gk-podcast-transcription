1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,671
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday March 8th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:16,000
Speaker 0: We talk about how to not suck at not being a fanboy.

3
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:17,997
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:22,756
Speaker 0: So today I had an interview with a possibly new job down in Manhattan.

5
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:23,619
Speaker 0: We'll see how that goes.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,826
Speaker 2: Hooray a job of money.

7
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:30,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I may or may not continue to be working at IBM in the coming few weeks.

8
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,408
Speaker 2: So no more fun stories about stupid people.

9
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:40,499
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll say this much once I leave IBM and I know I'm never gonna come back.

10
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:42,188
Speaker 0: I'm not like.

11
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:43,700
Speaker 0: I can't reveal any of these secrets.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:53,340
Speaker 0: I know like I can't talk about a lot of the like specific secret confidential whatever But I can definitely do a tell all my experiences at IBM.

13
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:57,512
Speaker 0: So expect at least one or two podcasts on that.

14
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:58,054
Speaker 0: if this comes to.

15
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,580
Speaker 2: so that'll be like a Dilbert Thursday.

16
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:00,875
Speaker 0: He has something like that.

17
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:11,610
Speaker 2: Yeah, so today You might have noticed I changed some things on The WordPress our blog that runs the podcast and everything.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:19,127
Speaker 0: now if a million episodes of geek night suddenly appeared in your pod feeder We're sorry, but I think you did something wrong.

19
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:21,774
Speaker 2: Well, you didn't necessarily do something wrong.

20
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:26,070
Speaker 2: You just did something poor as In this is all Scott.

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,300
Speaker 0: I don't even use pod catchers.

22
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:37,887
Speaker 2: Yeah If you're using a crummy pod catcher like I don't know some random RSS reader or if you're subscribed to the wrong feed the feed You should be subscribed to is the feed burner.

23
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:41,520
Speaker 2: one feeds that feed burner comm slash whatever nights geek nights.

24
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:48,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anyone out there is subscribed to just a raw WordPress feed stop doing that because it's not good for you.

25
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,860
Speaker 0: that feed can change a lot.

26
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,708
Speaker 0: The feed burner feed is the official one.

27
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:54,100
Speaker 0: That's the only one that we I guess support.

28
00:01:54,701 --> 00:02:01,700
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, and if you have your pod catcher set up to download every episode no matter what you probably don't want to do that.

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,870
Speaker 2: you probably want to set it to download the most recent episode or Download episodes when you click on them.

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,199
Speaker 2: that way you don't automatically download a billion episodes.

31
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:10,059
Speaker 2: You know you already listened.

32
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:19,400
Speaker 2: The other thing is we do have separate feeds now if you oh you can only let you if you want You can subscribe to just Monday just Tuesday or just Wednesday of geek nights.

33
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,920
Speaker 0: We've already had about 20 people do this so far even though we haven't really advertised that these are there.

34
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,220
Speaker 0: I imagine these people found them via iTunes.

35
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you go to iTunes or Yahoo podcast you can find the separate geek nights feeds for Monday Tuesday Wednesday.

36
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:40,580
Speaker 2: And of course you'll still be able to find the geek nights Total feed which has Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday all in one yep.

37
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:48,040
Speaker 0: And once we finish with the theme and everything's all set up with the new look for geek nights Those feeds are all going to be prominently available.

38
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:58,547
Speaker 2: Yep, one more thing is that if you're a person who is only listening or you found us via the Monday only Tuesday only You know links.

39
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:01,199
Speaker 2: I guess it would be a Wednesday only link because it's Wednesday, right?

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, if you're subscribed to just geek nights anime guess what we do three other days a week of podcasting.

41
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,595
Speaker 2: So if you like things besides anime you should subscribe to the geek nights normal feed.

42
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,517
Speaker 2: that has everything in it.

43
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,499
Speaker 0: now eventually we're gonna add all that stuff to the Closing bit so we won't have to say this at the beginning of every.

44
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,812
Speaker 2: yeah And also we will have a Thursday only feed.

45
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:29,073
Speaker 0: I know some people like Thursday But yeah, we had some people tell us lately that Thursdays are the favorite days.

46
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,940
Speaker 2: really because it's not my favorite day.

47
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,450
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not the easiest day for me.

48
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:33,831
Speaker 0: Well.

49
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:38,626
Speaker 0: It'll be easier once we finish all the research We've got lined up for the big Thursday episodes.

50
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:44,119
Speaker 2: yep, but yeah, so everyone knows that's how your subscription should go.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,083
Speaker 2: Everything is feed burner.

52
00:03:46,124 --> 00:03:47,327
Speaker 2: don't subscribe to anything.

53
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:48,170
Speaker 2: That's not feed burner.

54
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:51,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, so someone interviewed Michael Dell today.

55
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:59,068
Speaker 2: I don't know if you know, but Michael Dell is the guy who's in charge of Dell computers, and they said hey How come you're not being all Linux II?

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,000
Speaker 0: and he gave some pretty good answers as to why not yeah?

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,980
Speaker 2: So basically what he said was he tried ready.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,797
Speaker 2: They tried back in the day to just use Red Hat and the problem was is no one bought it?

59
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:12,080
Speaker 2: because they said We don't want to use Red Hat Red Hat sucks.

60
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,590
Speaker 2: Why don't you have this other distribution or this other distribution?

61
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,254
Speaker 2: so he says you know what.

62
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,180
Speaker 2: fine if we put only one?

63
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,880
Speaker 2: Distribution.

64
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:22,969
Speaker 2: everyone would complain that they didn't pick the distribution that they wanted.

65
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:30,389
Speaker 2: if they picked a few distributions like let's say three or four People would complain because why not have this one?

66
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,613
Speaker 2: and this one also?

67
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,880
Speaker 0: yeah, but I use kibonto bla bla bla.

68
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:35,644
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I use Mandrake.

69
00:04:35,905 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mandriva now whatever yeah, so the point is that he makes is that it's not possible or Practical for Dell to support all those different distributions.

70
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:55,319
Speaker 2: They could reasonably support a few, but the problem is is no distribution has such a vast majority of Following that they can pick that one.

71
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:58,474
Speaker 2: You know it's like Ubuntu might be the most popular.

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:06,490
Speaker 2: the most popular means 10% which means if they pick Ubuntu 90% of people who want Linux on a Dell would still complain.

73
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,369
Speaker 0: now my take on this is that they don't need to market this To people who already know about Linux.

74
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:17,928
Speaker 0: if you already have a favorite distro You're not likely one of Dell's Linux box customers.

75
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:18,109
Speaker 0: see.

76
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,981
Speaker 2: that's what you would think, but it seems like Freaking.

77
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,438
Speaker 2: people actually want to buy Dell's with their Linux of choice pre-installed.

78
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,100
Speaker 2: I don't know what they see.

79
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,520
Speaker 0: I think those people are minority.

80
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:37,520
Speaker 0: I think what Dell could do is offer maybe just Ubuntu or maybe a handful of OS's depending and Offer these not not offer them to Linux geeks.

81
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:47,826
Speaker 0: We'll do it on their own anyway But market them as a solution like an alternative to Windows like heavily market Linux as like all the smart people use Linux The cool people use Linux doesn't crash.

82
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,295
Speaker 0: you can use Linux - it's more secure.

83
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:53,145
Speaker 0: if you can't afford OS X Yeah, you know that's it.

84
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,060
Speaker 2: I think Dell's strategy isn't to sell computers of that Windows.

85
00:05:57,181 --> 00:06:08,890
Speaker 2: I think their strategy sell computers period is to sell computers period and The only reason that they want to have Linux computers at all is because that way they could sell Computers to people who are Linux users.

86
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,000
Speaker 2: right now Dell really can't sell to Linux users.

87
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,980
Speaker 2: Linux users will go out and build their own computer.

88
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,887
Speaker 2: So that's why Dell started this.

89
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:23,480
Speaker 2: he says they started this n-series which comes with the free DOS Which means you can erase free DOS and put whatever Linux you want on there, and you don't have to pay the windows tax.

90
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, now part of the reason.

91
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:27,211
Speaker 0: I mean you wonder why don't they just offer it without any OS?

92
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:35,260
Speaker 0: but apparently Microsoft got really angry Way back when they decided to do that sort of thing claiming that they're just promoting piracy.

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,170
Speaker 0: You know who would buy a computer without an operating system.

94
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,037
Speaker 0: They're obviously going to pirate pirate windows.

95
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:40,880
Speaker 0: No one uses Linux.

96
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:48,000
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that if but Dell really pushed it though today and tried to sell computers that OS is that they would probably succeed.

97
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't see Dell doing that anytime soon.

98
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,060
Speaker 2: No they have no reason to just throw free dogs on there.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,204
Speaker 2: Okay, it doesn't matter.

100
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,557
Speaker 2: You know it keeps Microsoft and complaining what it doesn't mean.

101
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:04,910
Speaker 0: shit though I definitely think at least someone could make some sort of Linux computer combo and sell them to the market.

102
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,999
Speaker 0: as long as they advertised and did this marketing campaign.

103
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:14,240
Speaker 0: for You know just promoting Linux as a solution that is secure and maybe make people feel smart about using Linux.

104
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,392
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the one thing is it?

105
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,720
Speaker 2: no because Linux is free.

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,707
Speaker 2: No one's gonna put money in to try to sell it.

107
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:28,014
Speaker 2: all they do is you know they throw it on some really cheap hardware And say hey, here's a whole computer for only like a hundred bucks.

108
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,104
Speaker 2: 200 bucks come get it You know and it.

109
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:36,000
Speaker 2: it gives Linux this kind of like because they don't advertise all the good stuff about Linux.

110
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:44,350
Speaker 2: It gives it this kind of like Hyundai kind of feel like Kia kind of feel we're like oh, it's cheap But it's not as you know good.

111
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's cheap.

112
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:46,400
Speaker 0: therefore it must suck.

113
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:57,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's that's the opposite of true, and I think if someone like sold some computers The opposite of true exactly not not false not it's a lie, but that's the opposite of true.

114
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,360
Speaker 2: again I am more tired today than it was yesterday.

115
00:07:59,561 --> 00:07:59,802
Speaker 2: So

116
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:13,697
Speaker 0: see surprisingly despite the fact that I spent the morning in Manhattan And I took an ass early train into the city like I got to the train station so early There was no one else there, and I took the peak like commuter train in almost entirely by myself.

117
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,727
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I Did work at work today, so I'm all tired.

118
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:21,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also did work at work today, and I walked all around, New York City No great.

119
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:23,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what was I pass out soon?

120
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:30,884
Speaker 2: Yeah, if they put Ubuntu on a computer, and they sold it as this computer won't get viruses It won't crash.

121
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:34,216
Speaker 2: It does this and this and this and this don't you know don't?

122
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,480
Speaker 2: you're not to pay for software.

123
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:40,366
Speaker 2: There's software that does almost whatever you want already on it And you can still.

124
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,299
Speaker 2: I am your friends, and you can still do all these great things you know.

125
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,315
Speaker 2: But you know don't try to buy software in the store and don't try to play a game.

126
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:51,737
Speaker 2: Yeah That's the problem is like no matter what you advertise.

127
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:56,414
Speaker 2: There's still Something that someone's gonna try to do that you can't do and that's the problem with Linux.

128
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:59,208
Speaker 2: someone will go and buy That digital camera.

129
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,736
Speaker 2: that doesn't work that scanner.

130
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:01,339
Speaker 2: that doesn't work.

131
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:05,519
Speaker 2: They'll try to plug in their video camera to download a video off of it, and it won't work.

132
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:07,027
Speaker 2: You know that's.

133
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,259
Speaker 2: that's what you got to get over that kind of stuff.

134
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:12,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is it's not fun to make that sort of thing work.

135
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:13,775
Speaker 2: No it's.

136
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:18,300
Speaker 0: I mean I'll admit it I when I buy a new you know bit that's gonna go into my computer.

137
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:25,253
Speaker 0: I'll look online and I'll find if someone else has gotten into work in Linux, and if no one else has I don't buy that bit.

138
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:31,578
Speaker 2: yep And that's the good way to go because now companies are being forced to make things work with Linux before they sell them.

139
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:32,947
Speaker 0: yeah I mean Nvidia.

140
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:42,447
Speaker 2: yeah The problem is is an already existing things and in super new things because a lot of companies will say well We don't need Linux support right away.

141
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,351
Speaker 2: It won't make a difference.

142
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:49,680
Speaker 2: You know and they'll put it out, and then you got to wait or Something is so old and Linux support isn't gonna come around.

143
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:54,460
Speaker 2: But it's something useful that everyone has like a webcam of some sort or something like that.

144
00:09:56,742 --> 00:10:08,744
Speaker 0: Well anyway to move on to more relevant Anime related news since it is anime day Otakon for any of you who are planning to go to it has all but sold out of the hotel rooms that are remaining for This year.

145
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:09,067
Speaker 0: well.

146
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,159
Speaker 2: There's a big surprise.

147
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:13,980
Speaker 2: Yeah, they have a heart attack and die from not surprised.

148
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:19,834
Speaker 0: Well the thing is actually two of the hotels sold out within a week of the dates being announced.

149
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:31,930
Speaker 0: You know last August Mm-hmm, but yeah if any of you out there planning go to Otakon get your hotel room right now like literally stop listening to geek Nights and go get a hotel room.

150
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 2: otherwise you're probably gonna be screwed Doesn't matter at this point if you get a hotel room you're gonna be far far away from the convention center.

151
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:46,257
Speaker 0: Away, I think there are a few rooms left that are closed But those are the expensive rooms that most young fan children can't afford.

152
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:49,226
Speaker 0: yep We used to be that way in other news.

153
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:54,120
Speaker 2: anime, Boston their artists alley sold out in five minutes and a few seconds.

154
00:10:55,541 --> 00:11:02,730
Speaker 2: So next year, they're making their artists alley much bigger, but if you're looking for a good artists alley I would recommend going to anime Boston this year where we might go.

155
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:08,346
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're thinking about it, and they'll be Packed artists alley of awesome.

156
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:14,270
Speaker 0: and of course if you want to be in the Otakon artists alley subscribe to their RSS feed and Watch because last year.

157
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,639
Speaker 0: I think it sold out within an hour.

158
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:19,952
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you can't beat anime Boston's five minutes now.

159
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:20,434
Speaker 0: We'll see.

160
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:20,775
Speaker 0: we'll see.

161
00:11:20,795 --> 00:11:22,260
Speaker 0: it'll be a race at the artists alleys.

162
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,329
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh one more thing.

163
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:34,981
Speaker 2: there's some con in Australia or something And I think they set a policy for their dealers room that allows selling bootlegs as long as they're not licensed for release in Australia.

164
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:39,275
Speaker 2: so it's like if it's not licensed you can sell it here even if it's bootleg.

165
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,800
Speaker 2: so we'll see what happens to that convention.

166
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:46,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's a whole bunch of tricky stuff about copyright law, and I don't know much about Australian copyright law.

167
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:48,025
Speaker 0: I know in many ways.

168
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:51,479
Speaker 0: It's a lot more draconian, but there might be a big loophole here.

169
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:52,464
Speaker 2: I don't know.

170
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:53,990
Speaker 2: see it's always weird to me.

171
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,681
Speaker 2: the places that can get away with selling bootlegs in the places They can't.

172
00:11:56,701 --> 00:12:08,580
Speaker 2: it's like you have an anime convention for three days right if any bootleg DVDs are sold there It's like oh my god, but you have a store down the street from us an anime store And they sell bootlegs are crazy, and then no one cares.

173
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,799
Speaker 0: I don't think they have anything that isn't a bootleg.

174
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,360
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they can't really don't really compete with the Best Buy Pro DVD market.

175
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,820
Speaker 0: They can yeah, not even the DVDs.

176
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:20,958
Speaker 0: They have all these bootleg wall scrolls and bootleg posters and VHS bootleg.

177
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,494
Speaker 2: well They have some non bootleg some of the toys and things.

178
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:24,340
Speaker 0: yeah some of the toys.

179
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,163
Speaker 0: But I don't think they have a non bootleg wall scroll in that entire building Maybe not?

180
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:32,695
Speaker 0: they also know as I say that I've got a bootleg or tenof poster.

181
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,420
Speaker 0: I bought from them hanging above my desk.

182
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,602
Speaker 2: Awesome.

183
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:45,613
Speaker 2: Yeah, but also Another example like the super Midtown comic book store in New York You know they sell bootlegs at crazy stuff like all these old TV shows.

184
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,802
Speaker 2: you can buy like all of XO squad and DVD from Them.

185
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:52,488
Speaker 2: they used to saw all of Thundercats on DVD But then Thundercats came out on DVD.

186
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,900
Speaker 2: so they get the pros in and they sell the other one.

187
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:56,769
Speaker 2: You know they get the other.

188
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:57,719
Speaker 2: they take the bootlegs away.

189
00:12:59,041 --> 00:12:59,745
Speaker 2: It's kind of weird.

190
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,037
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how to get away with that.

191
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:02,660
Speaker 2: It's like this.

192
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,743
Speaker 0: You know why there's.

193
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:09,420
Speaker 0: so there's so many people out there selling bootlegs that you can't get them all and it's really not.

194
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,232
Speaker 2: It's like our friend Pete, but I mean all you did was walk into the store.

195
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:16,138
Speaker 2: There's a giant giant rack That's so obvious full of bootleg TV.

196
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:20,614
Speaker 0: I find out we had a similar discussion with Pete who you know tests food.

197
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:31,644
Speaker 0: as we were walking down in Chinatown over the weekend and we saw the shady dude selling raw deer heads out of a cardboard box on the side of the street and That sort of stuff.

198
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:32,771
Speaker 0: you just you can't stop it.

199
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:37,020
Speaker 2: if you can't stop it Then it's effectively not illegal and everyone should just do it anyway.

200
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:38,943
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

201
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:43,420
Speaker 0: it's real easy to catch people at a con because it's easy to just walk around and look what everyone's got.

202
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:44,828
Speaker 2: Well, you keep it hidden.

203
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,840
Speaker 2: You know, you know, we'll close by.

204
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,760
Speaker 2: You know a lot of the dealers had those boxes under their tables and you just assume those boxes.

205
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:55,311
Speaker 0: You know what more any excess merchandise company was doing.

206
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:56,034
Speaker 0: that it a note.

207
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:57,940
Speaker 0: a couple Otakon's back and they got kicked out.

208
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,144
Speaker 2: How did they find out?

209
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,208
Speaker 0: they have Pete.

210
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:03,440
Speaker 0: they have undercover people looking around and people will report stuff.

211
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,850
Speaker 0: So I assume some kids saw it reported to the staff.

212
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:07,538
Speaker 0: staff came over and hate bootlegs.

213
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:10,708
Speaker 0: Oh Asset, what do you mean ass head?

214
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,053
Speaker 0: I'm fairly against bootlegs.

215
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,546
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but I mean at the same time It's like the code of the schoolyard.

216
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:19,880
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, you know, you don't tell on people you let him get caught on their own.

217
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,746
Speaker 0: I tell on people.

218
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,699
Speaker 0: I told on some punk kids on the train once.

219
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,164
Speaker 2: Where were they doing?

220
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:27,300
Speaker 0: They ripped down one of the emergency signs because it's glow-in-the-dark.

221
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:35,288
Speaker 0: And then the conductor came over and I just said hey those kids ripped down the emergency sign That's supposed to be there and I watched hilarity ensue.

222
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:36,472
Speaker 2: Where'd the community do?

223
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,880
Speaker 0: He yelled at him and then this parent came over.

224
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,146
Speaker 0: Why are you yelling at my kid?

225
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,960
Speaker 0: and then the conductor's like her kid just damaged train property?

226
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could cause you call the police.

227
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,040
Speaker 0: It was just hilarious.

228
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,808
Speaker 0: Uh Yeah, I was proud of that.

229
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:48,532
Speaker 0: punk kids.

230
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:49,920
Speaker 0: I'm no longer a punk kid now.

231
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,858
Speaker 0: I'm the crotchety old man who gets the punk kid in trouble.

232
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,608
Speaker 2: Punk kids and crotchety old man eternal enemies.

233
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:02,144
Speaker 2: We need to make a video game about crotchety old men versus punk kids And you can be either side.

234
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:09,987
Speaker 2: In fact, it's you a multiplayer online game massively multiplayer massively multiplayer online game Crotchety old men versus punk kids.

235
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:13,617
Speaker 2: Of course, you can only own property if you're a old man.

236
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:18,315
Speaker 2: you get this giant lawn And the punk kids try to invade it, but they have weapons and you don't so.

237
00:15:18,616 --> 00:15:22,075
Speaker 2: but you do have a lawn And a law, you know cops.

238
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:28,340
Speaker 2: Yep But the cops are all NPCs And they eventually can get mad at you if you call them too often.

239
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,027
Speaker 0: Why don't we just make a progress quest extension?

240
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:31,830
Speaker 0: that does this game?

241
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:32,612
Speaker 2: Perfect.

242
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:34,577
Speaker 2: Speaking of progress quest.

243
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:37,663
Speaker 2: I'm currently level 27 outstanding.

244
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:38,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

245
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:49,606
Speaker 2: I don't know how many of our listeners are familiar with the concept of Super doll fee.

246
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:55,705
Speaker 0: it's uh, if any of you are into it, that's cool But I personally find it a little scary and a little creepy.

247
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,287
Speaker 2: It is very scary.

248
00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:07,415
Speaker 0: Basically what super doll fee is is I'll warn you if you try to define what super doll fee is in any way Anyone who knows what they're talking about is gonna jump down your throat in the forums.

249
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:09,645
Speaker 2: They'll find you Yeah, you know what?

250
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,639
Speaker 2: They're scary because they like super doll fee so they can shove it.

251
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:24,560
Speaker 2: so it's basically these ball-jointed dolls and they make clothing and Stuff for them and they cut their hair and color their hair and it's like a super customizable doll.

252
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:32,624
Speaker 2: Usually they make them look like j-rockers and make them like j-rockers anime characters, whatever they want, you know And it's kind of freaky.

253
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,553
Speaker 2: You'll see him sometimes in your artist alley or something.

254
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:39,348
Speaker 2: And yeah, they're generally Something you don't want

255
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:39,974
Speaker 1: to get involved in

256
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,284
Speaker 0: Unless you're really into that sort of thing.

257
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,029
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't begrudge anyone having a hobby.

258
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:49,104
Speaker 0: just Be warned that if you're really into super doll fee I might find you a little creepy.

259
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:55,030
Speaker 2: Yeah, not to mention the fact It's really the money that makes it the most creepy and the amount of time spent on it.

260
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,572
Speaker 0: You know what?

261
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,585
Speaker 0: It is about as addictive and time-consuming as Warhammer is.

262
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,182
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's about equal to that Warhammer at least.

263
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:10,323
Speaker 2: there's a good game in Warhammer, you know Unlike some CCGs like magic or whatever or the penny arcade collectible card game.

264
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:13,069
Speaker 2: Yeah, Warhammer is actually a somewhat decent game.

265
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,747
Speaker 2: So there's something to it, you know super doll fee is just nothing.

266
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,597
Speaker 0: It's like Warhammer wasn't a game.

267
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:24,529
Speaker 0: Um, I know I submit that there are people out there for whom it is not a game.

268
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:25,973
Speaker 2: That is true.

269
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:27,496
Speaker 2: And those people are equally scary.

270
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:28,277
Speaker 2: So yes.

271
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,117
Speaker 2: Anyway, put that aside You can customize.

272
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:37,310
Speaker 2: super doll fees are made for customization But some dolls are not such as Barbie.

273
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,636
Speaker 1: But some people have

274
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,442
Speaker 2: decided to customize Barbie anyway,

275
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,690
Speaker 0: and they made Barbie into an

276
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:44,960
Speaker 2: otaku,

277
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,163
Speaker 0: haha.

278
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:50,645
Speaker 2: so here you will see someone who has customized Barbie into otaku.

279
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:55,429
Speaker 2: Barbie she has a T-shirt with one of Hello Kitty's friends on it.

280
00:17:56,031 --> 00:18:02,250
Speaker 0: The fact that she has the little sketchbook with the little somewhat poorly drawn anime style sketch on it is just classic.

281
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:21,029
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she also has like a little like a Japanese snack and a j-pop CD and a little bag of a little artist thingy a little portfolio bag and You know, she's totally drawing all sorts of little anime arts on a very Barbie sized sketchbook.

282
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:28,189
Speaker 0: You know with a little bit of editing Scott I could make a podcast where basically it's just you talking about how awesome this Barbie doll is.

283
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:38,436
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's not good because the last thing the Barbie does is transform into magical Barbie Sailor Senshi Woot, which is ultra frightening.

284
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,510
Speaker 0: I submit that the cross-dressing Ken is slightly more frustrating.

285
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:43,860
Speaker 2: I was gonna keep that a secret.

286
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,276
Speaker 2: So if you would go to the site and see it Oh, well, you know what.

287
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,289
Speaker 0: go to the site and see the cross-dressing Ken.

288
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:52,050
Speaker 2: Yeah, so at the bottom of the site is worse than otaku Barbie.

289
00:18:53,211 --> 00:19:02,142
Speaker 2: It's cross play Ken and it's Ken with the tiara dressed like Sailor Moon And he's got a freaking beer belly and it's frightening.

290
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:04,510
Speaker 0: Hey, it's no Sailor Bubba bobblehead.

291
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,182
Speaker 2: No, it's not a Sailor Bubba bobblehead, but why don't those exist?

292
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:09,407
Speaker 2: they would sell like hotcakes.

293
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:10,010
Speaker 0: they do exist.

294
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,275
Speaker 0: They were sold at anime central.

295
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:12,259
Speaker 2: Where do we get them?

296
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:14,830
Speaker 0: I didn't get one, but I saw them there.

297
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:22,410
Speaker 2: I've been anime essentially where the official bobbleheads made by the bobblehead company or they knock off I don't know cuz the real bobbleheads have like ceramic heads.

298
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:28,150
Speaker 0: See, all I know is the only place I really saw Sailor Bubba with any degree of regularity was anime central.

299
00:19:28,654 --> 00:19:29,684
Speaker 1: I saw him at an Otakon.

300
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,876
Speaker 0: Yeah He's not at every Otakon.

301
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:33,418
Speaker 1: No, he's not.

302
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,050
Speaker 0: he was at every anime central for a while.

303
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,543
Speaker 1: He's you know, he's not really as big now.

304
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:39,990
Speaker 1: It's like Jewish wolf would took his spot.

305
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:42,558
Speaker 0: And all you mean Mike Pfeffer.

306
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder if he listens to us after he was on.

307
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:45,593
Speaker 0: I don't know.

308
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,066
Speaker 0: So Mike Pfeffer, do you still listen to geek nights?

309
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,249
Speaker 0: Yeah If you don't we're gonna keep calling you Jewish wolf would.

310
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:55,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, he really doesn't like being called Jewish wolf.

311
00:19:56,232 --> 00:20:00,610
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's more that Jewish wolf would was something that made him really like well-known and popular.

312
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,061
Speaker 0: But it's not the thing he wants to be remembered for.

313
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:06,334
Speaker 1: he wants to be remembered for being awesome And he is kind of awesome.

314
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:11,370
Speaker 0: So he's really digging up that off Communist Party of anime thing, which I find fairly hilarious.

315
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:15,828
Speaker 1: Yes, so, um, we'll definitely hook up with him at some con in the future.

316
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:18,217
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe bring him on the show again.

317
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we'll get him here so we can use the real equipment.

318
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,008
Speaker 0: You can hear what his voice actually sounds like.

319
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,401
Speaker 0: All right, so my thing of the day.

320
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:38,407
Speaker 0: I had some other thing of the day which is actually kind of cool And then I decided to look in my delicious for some news and I realized that a while ago I had put something in my delicious and then forgotten about it.

321
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:40,425
Speaker 1: Now that's the point of delicious.

322
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:50,523
Speaker 0: now all of you are familiar with bleach because you're all listening to the anime portion of geek nights and bleach is One of the new popular shows like Naruto or Yu Yu Hakusho.

323
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,510
Speaker 1: It's a shonen action fighting show.

324
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,142
Speaker 1: It follows the already know you already know my opinion of these shows.

325
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,670
Speaker 0: it follows the formula of here's some awesome characters.

326
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,295
Speaker 0: Oh, here's an awesome story.

327
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,181
Speaker 0: Oh five episodes have gone by.

328
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,545
Speaker 0: Well, fuck that story.

329
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,474
Speaker 0: Let's have them fight for the next 3,000 episodes.

330
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,510
Speaker 1: That's exactly the definition of shonen action.

331
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:15,481
Speaker 0: I mean the characters are really kind of cute and cool and if it weren't for the fact that it's just a fighting show I'd Be all about it, but I'm sorry.

332
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,449
Speaker 0: It's just a fighting show.

333
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:17,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like Yu Yu Hakusho.

334
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:26,021
Speaker 1: You know the first two episodes like this amazing plot these funny characters and then oh We're gonna have a giant tournament Naruto ninja school.

335
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,690
Speaker 0: forget that ninja school ninja school was hilarious.

336
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,310
Speaker 0: And then suddenly they're fighting and in tournaments.

337
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:37,170
Speaker 1: Don't do you realize that they just took the first few episodes and dragged it out to be a 26 episode show?

338
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,174
Speaker 1: It would be amazing.

339
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:40,604
Speaker 1: But when they just start a fighting show instead, it sucks.

340
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:41,910
Speaker 0: It sucks to us.

341
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,160
Speaker 0: I find out that a lot of people like it.

342
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,150
Speaker 1: I Don't know what's up with it.

343
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,130
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta admit when I watch Naruto the first time it's something about these shows.

344
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,665
Speaker 1: We're like like rave master was another one that you don't realize.

345
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:53,890
Speaker 0: it's a fighting show right away.

346
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,576
Speaker 1: You don't realize the fighting show you've.

347
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,684
Speaker 1: you've gotten to the 13th episode.

348
00:21:57,704 --> 00:22:09,269
Speaker 1: when they finally finished the fight You realize this is the 13th episode and then you go back and you look and you say hey this fights been going on since episode 5. oh I'm not watching anymore.

349
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:14,710
Speaker 1: You know, it's like it tricks you and as soon as you realize it you're you're safe.

350
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:24,030
Speaker 1: But you know, I don't know they have some sort of magic formula so you don't figure it out Though part of the reason bleach is slightly more interesting to me is that she'll probably embarrassed.

351
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:30,639
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say who she is, but we have a friend who looks exactly Like Rukia from the show.

352
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,930
Speaker 1: I don't know which character that is, but I'll look it up later.

353
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,846
Speaker 0: Well, she looks exactly like the person I'm talking about.

354
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,817
Speaker 0: All right But like it's creepy.

355
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,010
Speaker 0: She does a cosplay and she might as well be the character.

356
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:52,350
Speaker 1: There are lots of people, you know who could pretty much be any cat, you know certain characters, yeah, but anyway Bleach is very popular and I discovered I'm not exactly sure what this is.

357
00:22:52,430 --> 00:23:03,067
Speaker 0: I think it's just the promo for something that someone wants to do or maybe they're making a musical But it's basically a bleach rock opera live action.

358
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,836
Speaker 1: That reminds me of the utenna pull a musical.

359
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:13,100
Speaker 0: All right, the utenna is Utenna and captain Tyler are my favorite two anime ever.

360
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:17,500
Speaker 0: I think Howie bebop is one of the best anime ever but Tyler and utenna are like near and dear to me.

361
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:25,740
Speaker 0: I could to go down to the infinite Horrible fanboy detail on all the various intricacies of utenna and I love everything to tenor involved.

362
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,012
Speaker 1: That's almost as scary as a super dolphin.

363
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:33,379
Speaker 0: the utenna musical Made me want to claw my own eyes out and then kill myself with them.

364
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:36,053
Speaker 1: I think we had a tape somewhere that had like a few.

365
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,380
Speaker 0: I still have that tape.

366
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,131
Speaker 0: It has most of the musical on it.

367
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty frightening.

368
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,096
Speaker 0: It's like a fifth generation fan sub that's barely watchable of the last episode of utenna.

369
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,364
Speaker 0: and then the musical Here.

370
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:54,567
Speaker 1: to give you an example of what watching the utenna musical is like Imagine some people doing in utenna cosplay.

371
00:23:55,088 --> 00:24:04,000
Speaker 1: They're seriously trying to act out what happens in the show But they're singing poorly and they have a slightly higher production value.

372
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:08,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, so just take a typical cosplay sketch and knock it up a notch.

373
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:09,724
Speaker 1: Not good.

374
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:13,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially since it's not one of those funny clever cosplay sketches.

375
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:15,740
Speaker 1: It's trying to be realistic cosplay sketch.

376
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:16,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was definitely.

377
00:24:16,824 --> 00:24:19,975
Speaker 0: no the Muppets do antenna, which is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

378
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:26,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, um The bleach Iraq opera here is it's kind of cool.

379
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,388
Speaker 0: I got to admit it that I kind of like the music.

380
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,615
Speaker 1: the production seems pretty good.

381
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,039
Speaker 1: The music is average to me.

382
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:35,531
Speaker 0: Well, it sounds like the music would be good if someone better we're singing it.

383
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:38,140
Speaker 1: it seems to represent the show pretty well.

384
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:39,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, people are fighting.

385
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:40,871
Speaker 0: There's Shinigami.

386
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,016
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

387
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:42,839
Speaker 0: No, they're fighting again.

388
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:44,867
Speaker 1: Yep, that's pretty accurate.

389
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:45,410
Speaker 0: Now.

390
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,918
Speaker 0: The thing is I mean, I like the music.

391
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:58,560
Speaker 0: the problem the problem with this thing just seems to be that either they pulled the classic musical mistake of Hiring people who look good instead of people who can sing or these are just stand-ins and they're like trying to promote this thing.

392
00:24:58,982 --> 00:24:59,905
Speaker 0: I'm really not sure.

393
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:01,733
Speaker 0: I haven't done any research on this.

394
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:03,179
Speaker 0: I just watched the clip and you should do.

395
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:14,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't tell I'm not Japanese or anything but if you like bleach or if you know what bleach is you should probably watch this little video and You'll either laugh or cry or something.

396
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:15,858
Speaker 1: It'll be worth your time.

397
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:21,320
Speaker 0: Yeah So anyway, it's anime day and it's also how to not suck week.

398
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 0: Now we realized that all of the topics we could really cover how to not suck that involve anime are very very specific topics that many of you probably don't care about like How to not suck at running a panel at a convention or how to not suck at running an anime club?

399
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,369
Speaker 0: Or how to not suck at collecting comics.

400
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:45,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, you already did how to not suck at a convention.

401
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,238
Speaker 0: I think well, we did three episodes on how to be good at a convention.

402
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,520
Speaker 1: basically Well, how to not suck is just our way of saying how to be good.

403
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:00,760
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess we could do how to not suck at being an anime artist But all we'd have to say is go to art school and practice because we don't freaking know shit about art.

404
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't draw a straight line.

405
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:07,164
Speaker 1: I can draw a stick figure happy one - yeah, you can Mean stick figure.

406
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:07,726
Speaker 1: Yeah.

407
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:08,548
Speaker 1: Sure.

408
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:21,870
Speaker 0: So we decided partly because we're still very tired from the weekend We're just gonna do a very quick how to not suck at being a fan In other words how to not be a horrible fanboy.

409
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:32,077
Speaker 1: Yep, because a lot of people out there, you know I mean there are some things there were There are some people who are fanboys and proud of it like the comic book guy in The Simpsons.

410
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:33,000
Speaker 0: No, that's fine.

411
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:37,036
Speaker 0: I mean if you're that dude go ahead and be that dude all the way.

412
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:43,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically I don't want to come near you, but I'll respect the way you do things and I'll stay clear and it'll be all good.

413
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:51,720
Speaker 0: Yeah We're also not gonna talk about taste in anime because you're allowed to like whatever you want and whatever Our opinions may be whatever even though our opinions are correct.

414
00:26:52,767 --> 00:27:10,500
Speaker 0: Okay But anyway, all we really want to talk about here because we don't want to sound like assholes more so than we already are are Just things that you can probably try to avoid Because these are the kind of things that a fanboy does and maybe doesn't realize they're doing or doesn't realize that it's annoying to others.

415
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:21,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there are a lot of people I'll run into at conventions where they'll be normal cool guys for the most part But they'll have something about them or they'll have a certain way about them.

416
00:27:21,575 --> 00:27:22,518
Speaker 1: That is totally like.

417
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:26,919
Speaker 1: alright You need to get away from me now You know, it's an odor.

418
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,667
Speaker 1: Odor is the first thing on the list.

419
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:33,500
Speaker 0: Alright, so, uh, if you like anime, that's fine.

420
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:37,011
Speaker 0: If you have bo I don't care if you like anime or not.

421
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,095
Speaker 0: That's not fine.

422
00:27:38,436 --> 00:27:39,038
Speaker 0: Don't have it.

423
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,525
Speaker 1: Yes There are two places you have to worry about.

424
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:41,987
Speaker 1: bo.

425
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,153
Speaker 1: number one anyplace crowded.

426
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:49,633
Speaker 1: if it's crowded and you're not wearing deodorant Or any purse print which I don't recommend wearing any purse print ever.

427
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:51,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get into that later.

428
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,128
Speaker 0: We'll do a whole show in some other episode.

429
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:54,111
Speaker 1: Yeah hygiene.

430
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,838
Speaker 1: We already did this one hygiene show.

00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:56,360
Speaker 1: we can do another.

432
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:04,428
Speaker 0: well It's very simple if you're at a con or an anime club or out in public right your favorite store one Take a shower at least every other day.

433
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:04,970
Speaker 0: Come on.

434
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,160

437
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:18,340
Speaker 0: you're not a good person.

438
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:19,986
Speaker 0: In fact, you're a very bad person.

439
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,933
Speaker 1: Also, make sure you're showering properly.

440
00:28:22,013 --> 00:28:23,880
Speaker 1: Just getting yourself wet and getting out is no good.

441
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,271
Speaker 1: You need to wash your hair with shampoo and clean your body with soap.

442
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:35,339
Speaker 0: in the very least go by George Carlin's method of showering armpits asshole crotch and teeth in that order.

443
00:28:37,961 --> 00:28:40,169
Speaker 0: Actually, I think you want to do it in the.

444
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:43,220
Speaker 1: you know what I think he said in the order George Carlin.

445
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:44,946
Speaker 0: George Carlin made a joke cuz.

446
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:51,429
Speaker 0: then he said in the same order or in that order with the same brush Mmm, yeah, cuz he's George Carlin.

447
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:53,880
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but wash the crucial areas.

448
00:28:54,281 --> 00:29:00,964
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know how many times I've been to a con and I've been floored by someone like Floored as in.

449
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:03,960
Speaker 0: I can't imagine how that odor could come from a still-living human being.

450
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:07,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if you're at you know, I guess convention.

451
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,140
Speaker 1: we could talk about conventions more great.

452
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:16,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, well anime clubs anime clubs and make let you walk it around all day or you're in a crowded room of people and it's Hot and you're starting to sweat.

453
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:18,364
Speaker 0: Not even just anime.

454
00:29:18,565 --> 00:29:24,399
Speaker 0: if you're a comic guy and you leave your den of misery once a week to buy your comics on Wednesday That should be the day you shower.

455
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,679
Speaker 0: If you're gonna shower once a week make that the day.

456
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you got to look good when you go that comic book store.

457
00:29:30,534 --> 00:29:31,720
Speaker 1: The owner will be friendlier to you.

458
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,746
Speaker 1: Maybe give you a discount.

459
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:34,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta think about these sort of things course?

460
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:41,834
Speaker 0: I Think some of these comic people Use the BO as a defense because they walk into the store.

461
00:29:42,075 --> 00:29:42,898
Speaker 0: people back off.

462
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,593
Speaker 1: now They can get the comics they want without having to shove through the crowd perhaps but a lot of the crazy calm people have like Pre-orders, they don't need to shove through.

463
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:50,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

464
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:58,657
Speaker 1: Okay, number two Don't keep talking to someone if they don't seem to be like responding to you.

465
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:04,600
Speaker 0: I mean Basically, I was the president of the biggest anime club in the country for a year.

466
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:16,940
Speaker 0: I was on the board for three years and one of my many duties was being very polite and civil to people in public Meaning I had to always be nice to everyone no matter what because they're a member of this club and they're a member.

467
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:21,659
Speaker 1: I have to take care of them and I was the guy who got to say wow, you're a fanboy go away now.

468
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,105
Speaker 0: Tacked is a very beautiful thing.

469
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:29,640
Speaker 0: And if a fanboy is really bothering me, I usually won't tell him exactly what I think of him.

470
00:30:30,423 --> 00:30:30,724
Speaker 0: I won't.

471
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:32,090
Speaker 0: you know, I I just I'm very not.

472
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,480
Speaker 0: I don't like to destroy someone's ego.

473
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:36,807
Speaker 1: I will if necessary.

474
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:40,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not really pleasant, but I guess too much effort.

475
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:40,601
Speaker 1: it's

476
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:54,040
Speaker 0: a warning out there to people that if something if you're talking to someone and they keep looking away from you or not making eye Contact or they keep turning to their other friends or all they ever do when you say anything to them is go like

477
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:55,990
Speaker 1: Or yep.

478
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,663
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah I got real good at Pretending.

479
00:31:00,724 --> 00:31:03,180
Speaker 0: I'm paying attention to someone in those three years of running that clean.

480
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,510
Speaker 1: Here's the thing is this if I'm talking to someone and all they say is uh-huh Yep, and they're not looking at me or something.

481
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:09,811
Speaker 1: I go.

482
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:10,213
Speaker 1: Hey.

483
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:11,579
Speaker 1: Hey, are you paying attention to me?

484
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even want to hear what I'm saying.

485
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:30,247
Speaker 0: now Scott's a little weird I mean when it comes to that because basically one time we're we used to share a room in college and Just because we had a tiny little ass apartment and I'm laying in my bed I'm trying to sleep and Scott's trying to tell me something and all I remember is he stopped talking and he said like alright And I said and then he kept talking.

486
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:39,662
Speaker 0: then he said alright again and I didn't say anything and he said I'll write again And again, and then he said hey, hey, Ram Ram You're listening.

487
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:43,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then eventually realized that I wasn't listening.

488
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:47,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, well and then he woke me up, but that's a whole other issue.

489
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:58,573
Speaker 1: Well the point is if I'm talking it's because I'm trying to communicate information to someone else and if I in some cases You know, I only want to communicate it if they want to hear it.

490
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:02,300
Speaker 1: and if they don't want to hear it I want to make sure that they don't want to hear it or not.

491
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,380
Speaker 1: So I do so and if they don't want to then I won't tell them anymore.

492
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,340
Speaker 0: So basically if you're at a con or at an anime club or out in public and you're trying to tell someone about this is this Is huge when waiting in lines for nerdy?

493
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,929
Speaker 0: Yes, because you're stuck with the people you're waiting in line with.

494
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,840
Speaker 0: and I've been stuck in some lines with people.

495
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:32,611
Speaker 1: I've been sucking some lines with some people and the trend seems to be there'll be a group that you'll be next to and the Group often contains a bunch of normal guys and then a cool guy or a loner Don't want to be in line next to loners.

496
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,220
Speaker 1: always get in lines next to groups.

497
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,305
Speaker 1: It's much more.

498
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:36,511
Speaker 0: by all means be friendly.

499
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,480
Speaker 0: try to meet people hang out with people talk to people.

500
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,022
Speaker 0: Don't be afraid.

501
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:42,679
Speaker 0: just walk over to someone and talk to them like hey, I like Dragon Ball you like Dragon Ball, too.

502
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:46,578
Speaker 0: But if they obviously don't like Dragon Ball don't keep talking about it.

503
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:56,006
Speaker 1: Especially don't talk about hentai or yaoi or anything weird like that at all unless you're sure That they want to hear about it.

504
00:32:56,026 --> 00:33:02,171
Speaker 1: I mean you start talking about hentai and to me I will I will put you down solo.

505
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,857
Speaker 1: You want to kill your fury.

506
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:04,720
Speaker 1: You'll want to kill yourself.

507
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:07,219
Speaker 1: I'll be like wow, you're a perverted scumbag.

508
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we have.

509
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:13,760
Speaker 0: uh, are we have a friend who's really into yaoi like really into yaoi and you know what?

510
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,623
Speaker 0: We're fine with that.

511
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:18,880
Speaker 0: Okay, and usually when she tells us about yaoi, it always ends up being a funny story.

512
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,596
Speaker 0: So we want to hear it and it's obvious we want to hear it, but we had a friend.

513
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:23,400
Speaker 0: Well, not a friend.

514
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:32,793
Speaker 0: There was a person we knew at RIT when we were there who would follow us around and Interject himself into conversations to explain what kinds of hentai he liked.

515
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,478
Speaker 0: I'm not exaggerating.

516
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:39,977
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, you know what our conversation was like, hey rim you want to go to the anime club tonight?

517
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,705
Speaker 0: Hey Scott Yeah, that'd be fine.

518
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:43,254
Speaker 0: Hey rim and Scott.

519
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,984
Speaker 0: I just watched Disembowelment hentai.

520
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:47,792
Speaker 0: It's my favorite kind of hentai.

521
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:49,379
Speaker 0: What kind of hentai do you like?

522
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,619
Speaker 1: Uh, no kind go away, yeah.

523
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:57,690
Speaker 1: But I mean, it's like the person we know that likes yaoi.

524
00:33:57,931 --> 00:33:59,014
Speaker 1: when she talks about yaoi.

525
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:01,883
Speaker 1: It's always like oh my god There's a relevant yaoi.

526
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:05,314
Speaker 1: That's hilarious or you know, haha funny joke.

527
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:06,238
Speaker 1: It's never like.

528
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:12,199
Speaker 1: hey Do you want to come you know, see my favorite yaoi and then explaining the yaoi one time it was bad?

529
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:15,340
Speaker 1: But the thing is she no, I guess I wasn't there that time.

530
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, she doesn't bring up the yaoi like out of the blue with no reason constantly because that just means you're trying to get attention.

531
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, but she brings up when it's relevant.

532
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:33,967
Speaker 0: if if we're like at dick and busters Whatever hentai dubbing panel at Otakon or something because I hear that's hilarious and you start talking to me about the funny hentai We're watching that's cool.

533
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it's informative.

534
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:41,458
Speaker 0: But if I'm walking down the street and you start telling me about your tentacle yaoi, I'm gonna hit you with a tentacle.

535
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,908
Speaker 0: You don't have a tentacle or do I?

536
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,300
Speaker 0: ha ha we made a joke that was about a penis.

537
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,967
Speaker 0: That never happens on geek nights.

538
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:51,851
Speaker 1: Yeah.

539
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:55,306
Speaker 0: All right now Anime clubs out there.

540
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,400
Speaker 0: basically, it's tough to have an anime club.

541
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,220
Speaker 0: That's just about watching the anime because you know, you just watch the anime in your room.

542
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:03,916
Speaker 0: That's the argument that fanboys make at least now.

543
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:13,343
Speaker 0: to me Some watching anime in a group can often be one of the greatest experiences of an anime because they can turn a mediocre anime Awesome.

544
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:14,987
Speaker 1: All right now think about this.

545
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,992
Speaker 1: right you watch a show.

546
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:24,989
Speaker 1: Let's say it's a ridiculously crazy funny show like Excel Saga Or something else like that Genji Ken show.

547
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:25,592
Speaker 1: that's sort of new.

548
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:27,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, or like an old Lupin movie.

549
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:31,700
Speaker 1: Now when you watch these shows by yourself, you know, it's kind of funny.

550
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:47,779
Speaker 1: There's just something when you watch it in a room full of people where people yell out funny things or Every or you'll you know, because everyone is there paying attention that like if everyone starts laughing Maybe you'll notice a joke that you would have missed in your house.

551
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:58,695
Speaker 0: Or just that feeling of like something awesome happens like in an old Lupin movie Gee, Ken does something funny and crazy and everyone in the room goes Watching at home.

552
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,022
Speaker 1: You don't even like get that.

553
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,610
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is or how it works.

554
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:03,830
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do a scientific study on how that you know.

555
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,650
Speaker 1: The yeah the psychology of watching things in groups as opposed to watching the same exact thing alone.

556
00:36:08,871 --> 00:36:13,498
Speaker 0: So first off I guess if there's an anime club in your area Go check it out and try to watch anime with people.

557
00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:14,682
Speaker 0: You might enjoy it a lot more.

558
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:19,310
Speaker 0: don't discount an anime club Just because they don't show the newest fans of that you're watching right now.

559
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:26,032
Speaker 1: Even watching an old show that you've already seen with a bunch of people can be greatly enhanced if those people do not suck Yes.

560
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:33,509
Speaker 0: Now this brings us to the critical point on how not to how to not suck number one If it's a serious part of a show.

561
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:35,634
Speaker 0: Shut up Unless now.

562
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:38,786
Speaker 0: keep in mind this all depends on the group you're with and you have to gauge the group.

563
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:46,050
Speaker 0: if you're sitting with a Bunch of people who just rip on everything and like everyone's cool with everyone just talking and yelling then by all means go in with that.

564
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:59,735
Speaker 0: But if you're watching magical girl Y and her the boy She loves is about to stab her to death and it's this horrible dramatic scene and you crack a joke Loudly in the middle of a silent room where everyone's paying attention You suck.

565
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:02,627
Speaker 1: You definitely suck even though it's magical girl.

566
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,310
Speaker 1: Why I don't care?

567
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:19,690
Speaker 1: yeah, so the second thing you want to do is if you have something funny to say and it is appropriate to yell something out like Let's say You know how sometimes in normal life someone will say something that leaves them wide open to a witty insult or a witty retort.

568
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:23,549
Speaker 1: Yes, sometimes an anime will say something that leaves someone wide open.

569
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:27,930
Speaker 0: You know like like the horrible yaoi innuendo and a show that has nothing to do with yaoi.

570
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:36,390
Speaker 1: Exactly now, you know before you yell out whatever you're about to yell out You can't delay too much because then it won't be funny.

571
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:42,149
Speaker 1: So if you delay it if you hesitate at all more than like two seconds, don't say anything because people will go why you're too late.

572
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:54,109
Speaker 1: But do spend a half a second to make sure that you're laughing on the inside when you think about it or else Everyone will go Groan and throw things at you.

573
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,878
Speaker 0: Yeah And once again just pay attention to the crowd.

574
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:00,793
Speaker 0: if it's a bunch of people who like to watch their show silently don't yell funny Stuff out.

575
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,024
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, because that's just not gonna work.

576
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:03,829
Speaker 0: People aren't gonna like you.

577
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:08,565
Speaker 1: the other thing is you know, let's say you know, you think about your thing for half a second.

578
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:12,922
Speaker 1: yell it out if Everyone groans don't try it again.

579
00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:13,906
Speaker 1: You're not a funny person.

580
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:17,250
Speaker 0: Oh my god We had problems with that more than you could imagine.

581
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:18,755
Speaker 1: It's like that was always.

582
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:24,808
Speaker 1: my strategy is if there was something if it was appropriate for me to yell something out and I had Something funny to say I would go with it.

583
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:32,279
Speaker 1: And if people laughed I would wait until I got the next one and I would gauge that one in Myself against the previous one.

584
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,187
Speaker 1: and if it was more funny, I'd let it loose.

585
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,477
Speaker 1: or equally funny I'd let it loose if it was less funny.

586
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:37,542
Speaker 1: I'd keep it in now.

587
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,049
Speaker 0: also don't be tricked by success.

588
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:48,910
Speaker 0: Say you yell something out and it's hilarious and like the whole room explodes with laughter Don't take that as a license to yell something out every five seconds for the rest of the anime because they'll kill you.

589
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, you only yell something out when it like.

590
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:55,130
Speaker 1: just comes to you, you know If you're trying to think of stuff to yell out you're in trouble.

591
00:38:55,752 --> 00:39:01,370
Speaker 1: You have to just you know, sit there let it come let it cut the anime absorb into your body.

592
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:07,010
Speaker 1: And then whenever something hilarious just pops into your mind, you know gauge it really quickly and let it loose.

593
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:07,672
Speaker 1: That's the.

594
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:09,139
Speaker 1: that's the the method.

595
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:09,380
Speaker 0: Yep.

596
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,800
Speaker 0: The rule here is when in doubt shut your pie hole Yep, or in the very least whisper to your friend next to you.

597
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:20,950
Speaker 1: and if your friend next to you starts laughing Maybe you can manage to do a little room spreading action.

598
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:28,386
Speaker 0: Yeah That's often happened where something fun someone says something funny to me Ha ha ha and then the person on the other side goes, what did he just say?

599
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:28,949
Speaker 0: and I whisper it.

600
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:33,365
Speaker 0: they go Ha ha ha and then it spreads to the whole room and there's like this rumbling laughter growing.

601
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:33,947
Speaker 1: Yep.

602
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:42,089
Speaker 0: That's a good one Alright, so last and least well I guess not least most for many people just because we don't want to you know Talk about fanboys for an hour here.

603
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:44,228
Speaker 0: It's not the most pleasant topic.

604
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:56,768
Speaker 0: But if you know the end of cowboy bebop and you know That the dude sitting next to you has never seen it or he just bought it and he's starting to watch it Don't tell him how it ends.

605
00:39:57,391 --> 00:40:06,489
Speaker 0: In fact, don't tell anyone how anything ends unless you're sure they either want to know how it ends and don't care if you spoil It or that, you know, they've already seen it.

606
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:11,906
Speaker 1: Yep, and don't say endings to things loudly or in public places.

607
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:17,230
Speaker 1: or you know If you're telling it to a whole group Make sure every single person in the group is cool.

608
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:21,430
Speaker 1: If one person's uncool either get them to leave the room or close their ears or something like that.

609
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:29,301
Speaker 0: I mean This is one of the biggest ways to spot a horrible fanboy because we'll have a group of people and someone will say oh Man, the end of eska flown a when wait a minute.

610
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:30,587
Speaker 0: You've all seen eska flown a right?

611
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,270
Speaker 1: Yep.

612
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:37,062
Speaker 0: And then if everyone says yeah, then they say whatever they're gonna say or other is they oh We'll talk about this later when so-and-so isn't here.

613
00:40:37,082 --> 00:40:37,524
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

614
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:38,248
Speaker 0: That's just etiquette.

615
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:38,987
Speaker 0: Yeah

616
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:59,422
Speaker 1: and if you're in like a group of people and you're gonna watch something make sure that whatever you're gonna watch is appropriate for everyone who's in there in the room watching, you know, not in just in terms of you know Content but in terms of you know, we're gonna watch episode 13 of you know Crazy show that is very serial and well,

617
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:02,330
Speaker 0: you know, we're just fantastic at coming up with fake names for anime.

618
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:06,477
Speaker 0: We had magical girl why and crazy show Alright.

619
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:12,369
Speaker 0: Alright, um Sad super robot 59 sad puppy snow angel sad boobies.

620
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:16,871
Speaker 1: No So if you're gonna watch to the 16th episode of super robot 59

621
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:20,130
Speaker 0: You know the one where Mickey gets his head chopped off and then everyone cries

622
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:33,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know has the totally unexpected robot explosion, you know Don't watch that if people haven't seen one through whatever before that because then Now the whole show is kind of messed up for them.

623
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:40,358
Speaker 0: now It might be painful because we've had the full metal alchemist movie for a long time Just sitting here waiting to be listened to watched.

624
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:42,706
Speaker 0: Well, yeah watched I listened to.

625
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,010
Speaker 0: I'm so used to talking about podcast.

626
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,196
Speaker 0: I finally got out of saying watch what I mean.

627
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:46,497
Speaker 0: Listen.

628
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,620
Speaker 0: now I say listen what I mean watch.

629
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, just make your spotless and check and get on with it.

630
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,390
Speaker 0: Haha, but my exponent is four but my shade is whites.

631
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:56,337
Speaker 1: Oh my god white run away.

632
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:56,960
Speaker 0: Haha.

633
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:58,165
Speaker 0: Yeah burning wheels.

634
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:58,446
Speaker 0: Awesome.

635
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:01,130
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that another show But anyway.

636
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:10,508
Speaker 0: So we had a bunch of friends over like three separate times where we could have watched the movie as a big group But every time there was at least one person who hadn't seen the end of the show yet.

637
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:15,810
Speaker 1: And we're not even sure if the movie spoils anything, but I'm reasonably sure.

638
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:17,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not a hundred percent sure though.

639
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:20,807
Speaker 1: So it's like because we're not sure we don't do it.

640
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:27,127
Speaker 1: You don't take risks Yeah, because I mean unless someone doesn't if someone doesn't care like go for it, you know Things I don't care about.

641
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:29,497
Speaker 1: Sometimes I want to be spoiled.

642
00:42:29,537 --> 00:42:38,145
Speaker 1: if anyone is gonna tell me the end of fancy Lala and what the hell happens with those dinosaurs I'll give you a dollar Yeah, or you asked me to spoil scrap princess for you a while ago because you didn't want to watch it.

643
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,562
Speaker 1: No, whatever I don't remember what you said, huh?

644
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:46,070
Speaker 0: Of course can't be careful because there's always the caveat of the person who you know.

645
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,690
Speaker 0: They'll say like they'll ask a question like they want to know the answer, but they don't really want to know.

646
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:57,144
Speaker 0: Generally don't answer that question or always at least preface it with a. Are you sure you want to know?

647
00:42:57,164 --> 00:43:00,285
Speaker 1: yeah And that way if they didn't really want to know it's their own damn fault.

648
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:06,228
Speaker 0: cuz like Emily She's watching Last Exile right now, which we just watch all of and soon we're gonna do our final thoughts.

649
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:09,544
Speaker 0: episode on Yeah, I promised all of you out there have been asking.

650
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:17,478
Speaker 0: starting next week We're probably gonna start actually reviewing anime again because we've got a whole backlog of shows now Yeah, and even more episodes is sitting on the computer.

651
00:43:17,618 --> 00:43:19,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus we're watching the original slayers again.

652
00:43:20,046 --> 00:43:20,366
Speaker 1: Great.

653
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:24,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love it But she'll sometimes she'll ask like does he die?

654
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:25,327
Speaker 0: what happens to him?

655
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:25,870
Speaker 0: now?

656
00:43:26,131 --> 00:43:28,880
Speaker 0: it's obvious that she doesn't actually want the answer to that question.

657
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:30,968
Speaker 0: a fanboy will immediately answer.

658
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:33,174
Speaker 0: a Non-fanboy will ask are you sure?

659
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:40,033
Speaker 1: the other thing is sometimes and this is a it doesn't take a lot of judgment skill But it takes some.

660
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:42,601
Speaker 1: there are sometimes it's okay to just tell all.

661
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:50,949
Speaker 1: there's nothing wrong with saying Luke Darth Vader is his father because everyone freaking knows and if they don't know hit him.

662
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:54,761
Speaker 0: Alright, I gotta tell the story about Greg and it does fake spoiler.

663
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,062
Speaker 0: He did.

664
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:57,670
Speaker 0: Alright, cuz this is awesome our friend Greg.

665
00:43:58,032 --> 00:43:58,959
Speaker 0: He told us this story.

666
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,917
Speaker 0: We were with him, but apparently this happened And even if it didn't happen, it's a damn good story.

667
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:07,489
Speaker 0: So remember episode 2 of Star Wars when it came out.

668
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,205
Speaker 1: You mean it was a. so episode 2 not Empire Strikes Back, but yeah the clone war.

669
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:23,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, the attack of the clones okay, so apparently he went to see it and On his way out because they saw like the midnight first showing there's a line of people Waiting for the second showing of it.

670
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:32,600
Speaker 0: So he starts talking and in a very loud voice says man that was awesome, but I can't believe they killed Yoda and This guy in the line goes.

671
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:35,617
Speaker 0: Thanks a lot asshole You just ruined the movie.

672
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,250
Speaker 0: and then he realizes what he just said and That guy got pooned in a way that no man has ever been pooned before.

673
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:43,273
Speaker 1: Yep.

674
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:48,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you don't realize why that's funny, I Don't know what to say to you.

675
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,550
Speaker 1: We have a Star Wars episode somewhere in the archives.

676
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:54,128
Speaker 1: You should go listen to it.

677
00:44:55,993 --> 00:45:01,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a thing of the day that was Star Wars related But I'll use it tomorrow if I don't find anything better tomorrow.

678
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:02,524
Speaker 1: Well, that's a quick one.

679
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:03,767
Speaker 1: We'll just let that loose whenever.

680
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:12,730
Speaker 0: yeah Geographically related to us Was oh, yeah, you know, I let it loose right now because we're devolving into the end of this episode.

681
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:18,230
Speaker 0: Okay, so a guy was caught selling crack near us in Poughkeepsie.

682
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,016
Speaker 1: There's a lot of crack guys up there.

683
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:20,438
Speaker 1: Whatever.

684
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:22,547
Speaker 0: Yeah now now any guess what.

685
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:27,297
Speaker 0: his name was Lando Calrissian Butler.

686
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,829
Speaker 0: his first name is Lando Calrissian.

687
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:35,230
Speaker 1: We're not sure if that was a misspelling by the newspaper and it's actually Lando Calrissian.

688
00:45:35,812 --> 00:45:41,858
Speaker 1: Or maybe his parents didn't know how to spell Calrissian and they made it Carlesan or whatever they wrote there.

689
00:45:41,898 --> 00:45:44,449
Speaker 0: or maybe he gave a fake name and they don't have an ID for it.

690
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,430
Speaker 1: What's your name Lando Calrissian Butler?

Speaker 1: but it will surprise you I guarantee.

720
00:47:07,754 --> 00:47:15,150
Speaker 0: And my last metabit here On the forums make you might have seen that I posted that we were like the number one search on Yahoo!

721
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:25,447
Speaker 0: Podcast for a whole bunch of things like anime manga comics geekery technology Science, we're like number six or seven now almost anything related to us you search for.

00:47:25,487 --> 00:47:26,351
Speaker 0: we're the number one Like.

723
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:27,578
Speaker 1: I really don't know how that happened.

724
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,630
Speaker 0: But now I'm starting to figure out how it happened.

725
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:38,149
Speaker 0: But then right like a few hours later Someone posted in the forums that you guys don't show up for shit in there and I looked as sure enough we didn't.

726
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,337
Speaker 0: So I did some investigating and it seemed basically I've discovered that Right.

727
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:57,527
Speaker 0: when it screwed up is when Scott added all of the feed burner feeds that I had created for all the days of the week of geek nights And I they're added in iTunes and Yahoo got really confused for a while about geek nights.

728
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,793
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever It doesn't matter.

729
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, not too many people use Yahoo!

730
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,668
Speaker 0: Podcast, but I'll note we have over 20 subscribers through Yahoo!

731
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:05,430
Speaker 0: Podcast alone.

732
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:08,901
Speaker 1: Yep, but who knows how many of those subscribers actually like I got?

00:48:08,982 --> 00:48:10,145
Speaker 1: I'm subscribed by Yahoo!

734
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,510
Speaker 1: Podcast, you know, it doesn't really.

735
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,997
Speaker 1: You know, it's not someone actually utilizing.

736
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:21,676

737
00:48:21,696 --> 00:48:24,444
