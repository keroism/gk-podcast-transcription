1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,697
Speaker 0: It's Monday February 13th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,479
Speaker 0: tonight We were gonna talk about DRM But we kind of get sidetracked and just wander around about meta bits and basically cop out of the episode.

3
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,227
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:34,880
Speaker 0: so last Thursday at the end of the show I started to tell a story and then I stopped because we were kind of out of time about my computer and my Monitor and my video card and something terrible that had happened.

5
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:38,417
Speaker 0: So I'm going to finish the story because I promised I would now.

6
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:44,870
Speaker 0: the other day I came home from work, and I turned on my Six and a half it's almost seven year old monitor.

7
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:45,593
Speaker 0: to you know.

8
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:46,596
Speaker 0: do my computer stuff?

9
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:58,359
Speaker 0: look at the websites I can't look at at work and all that sort of thing and I Turn it on and I go to unlock my computer And I noticed that my ex screensaver login thing is a little not looking so good.

10
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:05,379
Speaker 0: it's a little black and blurry and all artifact II and Generally looks like my monitor is fucked itself.

11
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:09,920
Speaker 0: So I log in and sure enough my monitor is fucked itself.

12
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:15,800
Speaker 0: There's dark lines that follow various colors around the screen, and it looks like the CRT has just died.

13
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,010
Speaker 0: So I'm pissed off, and I'm fiddling with things.

14
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:21,980
Speaker 0: I open the little OSD menu on the monitor.

15
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:31,420
Speaker 0: I'm moving stuff around trying to change brightness contrast see if I can get it into a usable state And it's not working, and I resigned myself to buy in a new monitor.

16
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:39,300
Speaker 0: Then I open the OSD one more time to change one more setting back to the way It was and I realized something that made me feel like an idiot.

17
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,067
Speaker 0: The OSD menu was just fine.

18
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,134
Speaker 0: It was perfect and bright and clear.

19
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:51,159
Speaker 0: just as though the monitor were new Turned out that my video card the GPU had overheated enough to where it shat itself.

20
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,219
Speaker 1: Yep, you should replace that fan a little sooner.

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,681
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fans kind of spinning But I burned my finger to the point that I got a tiny blister on it when I touched the GPU on my video Card.

22
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:04,588
Speaker 1: Wow you know what though?

23
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:10,418
Speaker 1: my video card one of the fans a little and I think it might be dying but there's not much I can do about it and the other one still works.

24
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:15,406
Speaker 1: and Yeah, but Wow It's not gonna die soon.

25
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,470
Speaker 0: I had a little blister.

26
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,900
Speaker 0: It's almost gone, but you can still see it if you look at my right pinky.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,820
Speaker 0: But it's a geforce 2 GTS, it's old as shit.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,320
Speaker 0: I paid almost four hundred dollars for it when it came out, so I think I got my money's worth over all those years.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,719
Speaker 1: This is a problem actually cuz like you don't think about it.

30
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:43,920
Speaker 1: But like back in the day when I had a Pentium 3450 right sure it had a normal heatsink with a normal fan on it And you didn't need a fan on the chipsets on the motherboard.

31
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:46,320
Speaker 1: You didn't need the cooling on the RAM or your hard drive.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,132
Speaker 0: You needed one fan in the front of the case.

33
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:55,964
Speaker 1: you need a perfectly normal fan and heatsink on your processor and a fan in the front of the case and a fan in the back of the case and a fan of the power Supply.

34
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,700
Speaker 0: a lot of cases didn't even have a fan in the back.

35
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,004
Speaker 0: Those are places.

36
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:03,620
Speaker 1: those are places where you've needed fans and heat sinks since the beginning of computers.

37
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:07,379
Speaker 1: You know every computer in a zillion years ago always had those fans.

38
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:13,163
Speaker 0: Then they've started coming out of these motherboards that came with a heatsink unlike the Northbridge Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:16,139
Speaker 1: well the thing is is that nowadays you need that?

40
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:23,422
Speaker 1: The problem is is that in the rush to make everything faster and faster and faster and more and more features is They.

41
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:32,750
Speaker 1: they've put more emphasis on speeding things up faster than emphasis on Making them you know stable and run cool.

42
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,315
Speaker 1: It's like nowadays.

43
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:42,299
Speaker 1: you can get like a 500 600 megahertz processor that runs without a heatsink you know without anything.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,166
Speaker 1: just Completely fine and cool.

45
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:52,274
Speaker 1: You know, but if you want something faster Then you can get it, but it's crazy hot yep.

46
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:53,740
Speaker 0: It also uses a lot more power.

47
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,772
Speaker 0: I mean you need three four five hundred watt power supplies now to run pcs.

48
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,745
Speaker 0: old pcs will run on a hundred watt power supply At work.

49
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,139
Speaker 0: I have a workstation that runs on a 65 watt power supply.

50
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,111
Speaker 1: See it's all comes down to lazy programming.

51
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:20,616
Speaker 1: what they used to do back in the day like we would have hundred megahertz computers and big companies would have giant servers and Instead of the giant servers just having a whole bunch of the same processor.

52
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:28,796
Speaker 1: We have at home They would actually have processors that were like insane and we're super hot And they wouldn't give anyone at home something that ran super hot.

53
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:34,620
Speaker 1: they'd be like You know that's way too hot and way too unstable and crazy for people at home to use.

54
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:44,574
Speaker 1: Now they give us the crazy stuff and we buy it because it's the only thing fast enough to run These poorly written programs that are so super slow and unoptimized.

55
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:49,559
Speaker 0: well the other problem is simply that People don't really think much about cooling their computer.

56
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,939
Speaker 0: I mean it's geeks do but even a lot of geeks they think about it.

57
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:59,340
Speaker 0: But they think about it as though It's still the 90s where you need a fan in the front and a fan in the back and whatever fan came with your CPU.

58
00:04:59,501 --> 00:04:59,884
Speaker 0: And that's it.

59
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:07,600
Speaker 1: no people go create They or they go too crazy with the cooling to see something their nerds and like geeks they go crazy.

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,642
Speaker 0: But a lot of geeks who aren't real big on computers don't know Mm-hmm.

61
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:14,774
Speaker 0: they just they use whatever came with a computer or they did.

62
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,380
Speaker 0: they get you know those little fans.

63
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,946
Speaker 0: They make a lot of noise instead of the big ones that actually do a good job Mm-hmm.

64
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:24,620
Speaker 0: No one thinks to look inside the computer and make sure all their fans are still running.

65
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:38,579
Speaker 1: Sometimes I would rather just have a computer that had a heat sink on the CPU a fan in the front fan in the back You know the same loadout in the olden days and have chips That just didn't need to be cooled that were stable and cool.

66
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:46,700
Speaker 1: But the problem is is that all the software is written so poorly that I really can't get by with such a slow computer anymore.

67
00:05:47,322 --> 00:06:01,520
Speaker 1: But if they hadn't ever you know started releasing crazy hot CPUs out to the public You know and and trying to catch up to Moore's law Then maybe programs would be written better, and we wouldn't have to worry about overheating and all that other bullshit.

68
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:04,260
Speaker 0: I'll point out that it's not all sloppy programming.

69
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:07,643
Speaker 0: I mean we do do more things with computers now We do.

70
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:14,220
Speaker 0: if I went back then and told myself you'll be editing audio in real time I would have laughed at myself and said that's impossible.

71
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:24,021
Speaker 1: Yeah, but still even today if you the the processor that you can get that will run just fine with just one fan On it.

72
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:30,420
Speaker 1: you know with an uncooled Northbridge and uncooled video card is still pretty freakin badass.

73
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:31,566
Speaker 0: Well consider this.

74
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,303
Speaker 1: it's just the ones that the ones that need super cooling You know like the.

75
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:39,956
Speaker 1: if you've seen the new standard AMD heatsink for the new crazy AMD chips.

76
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:44,389
Speaker 1: It's like wicked psycho But that chip is also wicked psycho.

77
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:49,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know how many of you remember Ram bus Whatever fuckers.

78
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:55,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, they made crazy insane fast RAM, but then they pulled some sort of intellectual property shenanigans.

79
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,369
Speaker 1: I never really understood the whole story.

80
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:03,179
Speaker 1: all I knew is that Rd Ram that Intel wanted you to use with some Pentium 4s is crap and no one uses it.

81
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:04,684
Speaker 0: here's the deal.

82
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:13,819
Speaker 0: to sum it up real real briefly it was developed by this company and Submitted to a consortium of whatever and approved as a standard.

83
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:21,199
Speaker 0: then the company after people agreed to this released their submarine patent said oh by the way, we already have patents on this yellow fails royalties.

84
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,128
Speaker 0: and Intel said yeah sure your Rams the best.

85
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,218
Speaker 0: and everyone else in the world said whoa fuck you.

86
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,960
Speaker 0: So only Intel and only certain Intel used this RAM and it was wicked fast.

87
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:46,079
Speaker 0: it was 800 megahertz like back in the day when a 400 megahertz thing was like unbelievable and It was so hot and fast that one you had to use it in pairs of two.

88
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:51,082
Speaker 0: You had to have two identical sticks for every bit of RAM you wanted To.

89
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:54,360
Speaker 0: you needed heat sinks on every piece of RAM or would overheat and break itself.

90
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,513
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's why it was relevant.

91
00:07:57,574 --> 00:07:58,400
Speaker 0: heat sinks on RAM.

92
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:10,836
Speaker 1: Yeah It says here from my cursory examination of a Wikipedia article and on Ram bus is that they basically tried to make it to prevent Anyone else from making Rd Ram and then they charge a shit ton of money for Rd Ram.

93
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,215
Speaker 1: Oh apparently The n64 and the PlayStation through had Rd Ram.

94
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,340
Speaker 0: really I didn't know that.

95
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 will use Ram buses XDR memory because Ram buses technology was pretty good in a lot of ways.

96
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:33,099
Speaker 1: It seems that their technology was really fast really powerful Ram and a whole lot of it.

97
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:38,072
Speaker 1: But it was also kind of hot and a little latent Compared to DDR.

98
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:41,740
Speaker 0: Yeah It's good for certain kinds of applications.

99
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:47,098
Speaker 0: Yeah I only know the story of it as it pertains to PCs because when it comes to PCs there were fuckers.

100
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:56,824
Speaker 1: everyone hated them and it seems like they have some sort of bus interface, you know as opposed to whatever bus our computers use and That's pretty good.

101
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,339
Speaker 0: Also called flex IO, but we could do a whole show on RAM one day.

102
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.

103
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:01,926
Speaker 1: but yet

104
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:15,122
Speaker 0: the moral of the story is that oh my god Despite the fact that my video card is hot enough to burn my flesh and leave a blister and despite the fact that it's been That way for at least six or seven months and despite the fact that it's failed Mostly

105
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:17,312
Speaker 1: oh, is that is still the geforce 2 GTS?

106
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:17,654
Speaker 1: Yes.

107
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,100
Speaker 1: Okay good get a new video card.

108
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:29,317
Speaker 0: I can still see the screen and I'm recording the podcast right now with this busted ass video card And I'm gonna keep using the busted ass visio card until next month when I buy a whole new computer.

109
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:29,839
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

110
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:31,805
Speaker 0: So it's a race against the clock.

111
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:32,909
Speaker 0: What's gonna die first?

112
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:44,059
Speaker 0: my will to not buy a computer until March or my GPU Mm-hmm Yeah, so, uh, yeah ubercon yeah, that was fun.

113
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:53,830
Speaker 0: Yeah We went to ubercon a gaming convention in North Jersey last weekend and it sucked Driving there and back but there was fun.

114
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,020
Speaker 1: driving back was the worst thing ever, but the con itself was great.

115
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, tomorrow is going to be ubercon day.

116
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:10,788
Speaker 0: We're going to talk almost entirely about ubercon and a gaming system called burning wheel Which the only way I can describe this is OMG OMG Heart heart heart.

117
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:11,372
Speaker 0: Yeah,

118
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:27,829
Speaker 1: you know, I've never really attached to any other gaming systems other than like D&D because either they were larps and I'm not a fan or They were just D&D with different sets of numbers or it was just D&D with like a few things changed Like you die real easily or something like that.

119
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,440
Speaker 1: This is actually a whole different kind of RPG.

120
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:45,050
Speaker 1: That's like totally amazing and different and I think it's a lot more fun Yeah, and a lot less miniatures based calm and part of it is that the guy who designed it demoed it for us And then later we played it with him.

121
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:50,711
Speaker 0: and let me tell you this is an awesome, dude We're gonna have him on the show sometime soon to talk about burning wheel.

122
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,078
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but we're not gonna talk about that today.

123
00:10:53,319 --> 00:11:00,667
Speaker 0: tomorrow We'll talk about ubercon and a bit about burning wheel and as soon as we line up this interview We're gonna do a whole show on burning wheel by itself.

124
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:01,350
Speaker 1: Yep.

125
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:04,078
Speaker 1: You probably won't talk a lot about burning wheel itself.

126
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:04,640
Speaker 1: tomorrow.

127
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,613
Speaker 1: We'll talk about the games that we talk about the game.

128
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:08,276
Speaker 0: We played.

129
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:09,179
Speaker 0: Yeah of it.

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,575
Speaker 1: Oh my omg, it's like because that'll be more like the experience of ubercon type of thing.

131
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:18,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah So we're talking about RDRAM and their evil patent, whatever.

132
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:23,962
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like the Red Cross of all people is getting a little crazy with some trademark Trade.

133
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:24,504
Speaker 0: but wait a minute.

134
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,714
Speaker 0: Their trademark is one of the simplest things in the world.

135
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,038
Speaker 0: freaking Red Cross.

136
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:39,427
Speaker 1: Yeah it's just a red plus and they're going after video game companies who use it on med kits and medics and trucks and Helicopters and play.

137
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:39,668
Speaker 0: wait.

138
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:40,172
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

139
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:43,485
Speaker 0: That's like going after God, I don't even have an allergy.

140
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:44,127
Speaker 0: That's just are they?

141
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:48,324
Speaker 1: how come they haven't gone after like movies that have you know war movies Or anything?

142
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:50,659
Speaker 0: or maybe those movies pay a royalty or something.

143
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:55,200
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm sure there's some TV shows involving war that have Red Cross.

144
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:55,843
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

145
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:58,172
Speaker 0: This might be this might be because you know how.

146
00:11:58,212 --> 00:12:05,419
Speaker 0: in trademark and copyright and patent law There's all those rules about you have to enforce it or try to enforce it or else you lose it.

147
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:09,600
Speaker 0: So they might not want to sue them but they have to sue them just to show that they're enforcing it.

148
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,524
Speaker 0: So they don't lose the trademark.

149
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:11,529
Speaker 1: Why don't they just lose it?

150
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:12,735
Speaker 1: It's just a red plus.

151
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:13,760
Speaker 1: No one doesn't know.

152
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,494
Speaker 0: I was about to say the Red Cross is a very good organization.

153
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:18,900
Speaker 0: They do good in the world.

154
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:25,700
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that they need to have their logo be theirs and sue people who don't have no use it without their permission.

155
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:31,236
Speaker 1: Everyone recognized everyone in the entire world, you know, except for people completely detached from society.

156
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:35,869
Speaker 1: Like I guess rainforest People, you know something like that.

157
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,335
Speaker 0: Yeah or BoS users.

158
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:41,166
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that was a nerd joke.

159
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:45,037
Speaker 1: there they see the red plus and they know that means hospital healing.

160
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:45,860
Speaker 1: help Red Cross.

161
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,495
Speaker 0: You know what it might be the red crescent because they use the red crescent in a lot of places.

162
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,338
Speaker 1: do do they?

163
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:51,001
Speaker 1: it says It's.

164
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:51,523
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's.

165
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:53,935
Speaker 0: I think it's a different organization, but it's almost the same.

166
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,407
Speaker 0: No It works in more in Muslim countries and such.

167
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,594
Speaker 1: But anyway, everyone sees that and they go.

168
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:04,625
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what that is There's no and it's not like they're used.

169
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:10,863
Speaker 1: the video games are using the Red Cross to signify the symbol of a fictional terrorist Organization.

170
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:11,144
Speaker 0: not like.

171
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,312
Speaker 0: you're playing World War two only instead of Nazis.

172
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:14,737
Speaker 0: You're fighting Red Cross workers.

173
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:17,944
Speaker 1: Yeah No, but I mean I could see.

174
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:21,735
Speaker 1: let's say I started selling.

175
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:23,400
Speaker 1: I made a movie cross t-shirts.

176
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,562
Speaker 1: Oh, no No Like.

177
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:31,483
Speaker 1: you use the Red Cross as a symbol to signify something other than what the Red Cross is Like.

178
00:13:31,523 --> 00:13:34,054
Speaker 1: I made it the symbol of my new.

179
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:42,759
Speaker 1: I made it the logo For my new car company or all the cars had a big Red Cross on them instead of like, you know Ford has the blue oval or what if I made a game?

180
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:48,214
Speaker 0: Where you're like, maybe the bad guy is the evil head of the Red Cross who's doing evil.

181
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:50,320
Speaker 1: and they're not even like the Red Cross.

182
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,340
Speaker 1: He's the head of some organization organization that provides medical services.

183
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,380
Speaker 1: They know not even one the prize medical services.

184
00:13:56,541 --> 00:14:01,000
Speaker 1: Like he's the head of some evil organization like you specter from James Bond, right?

185
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,034
Speaker 0: I'm saying straight out he uses but he uses the Red Cross as the logo.

186
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,920
Speaker 1: you see that's what I'm saying.

187
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:15,430
Speaker 0: I'm saying either way but in the end it shouldn't matter if I put on a Red Cross shirt and walk around my hometown No one's gonna think I'm working for the Red Cross.

188
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,152
Speaker 1: Well, they might.

189
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:18,220
Speaker 1: they might think you're an EMT or something.

190
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,490
Speaker 0: Well, they might think I'm an EMT because I I have this.

191
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:22,660
Speaker 0: it's weird but act a little aside.

192
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:35,980
Speaker 0: but at uber con we were sitting around in the lobby outside the reg desk relaxing and talking about cons and the staff lady from work on came over and Basically said I couldn't help but over here and she handed me a piece of paper and said write down all your suggestions.

193
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:40,574
Speaker 0: We wanna we want your advice And welcome you're talking about cons in general.

194
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:41,680
Speaker 1: we're really talking about uber con.

195
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,005
Speaker 0: But yeah, I don't know.

196
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:46,720
Speaker 0: we seem to give all this aura of we're experts because things like that happen fairly often.

197
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:47,725
Speaker 0: You know what?

198
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:48,188
Speaker 0: I think it is.

199
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,160
Speaker 0: It's a combination of loud and opinionated.

200
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's nothing to do with people thinking you're an EMT cuz.

201
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,099
Speaker 0: well What if I was wearing a Red Cross shirt and I was talking about, uh, how many MT then people think you're one?

202
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:00,559
Speaker 1: All right.

203
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:03,328
Speaker 1: So yeah, I don't know what the Red Cross out to.

204
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:07,905
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's only because they have to do this or they lose Trademark and I'll bet.

205
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:12,098
Speaker 0: a lawyer for them said you can't lose the trademark and I'll bet.

206
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,844
Speaker 0: no one even question Why they need the trademark.

207
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,130
Speaker 0: They just said oh we have to keep it.

208
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:15,914
Speaker 0: Mmm.

209
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,360
Speaker 0: That's my best guess whatever.

210
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,786
Speaker 1: So there's a thing.

211
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:21,594
Speaker 0: Oh, so you want to do all the news today?

212
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:22,800
Speaker 0: I guess that's fine.

213
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:23,719
Speaker 0: You can talk about this one, too.

214
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,969
Speaker 0: I'll just I'll provide witty banter and commentary.

215
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:30,203
Speaker 0: and I sort of there's this thing called HD CP High bandwidth.

216
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,171
Speaker 0: there should be a be there but they're assholes.

217
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,420
Speaker 0: whatever digital content protection.

218
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:48,151
Speaker 0: Hi, yeah, I've been with In the in the same vein of anything that has an acronym nowadays is bad Especially if there's a lot of D's in it or C's Like, you know DMCA ending is a is also bad.

219
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,697
Speaker 0: Yep, CD CBD tPA.

220
00:15:49,717 --> 00:16:05,096
Speaker 1: This is one of those though this ends in peanut a. but anyway what this does is Let's say you have a very High resolution movie Like the one in a blu-ray or an HD DVD.

221
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:15,939
Speaker 1: or let's see of a very high resolution video game on a DVD or whatever that you installed your hard drive and You want to play it on a high resolution monitor?

222
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:34,287
Speaker 1: Well, it seems that in present times we have this thing called the analog hole which pretty much means at some point The signal has to go the video signal has to go from your computer or DVD player or whatever To the monitor.

223
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:43,480
Speaker 0: So if I want to copy whatever copy protected shit They give me I go out of this hole into my handy-dandy recording device and have a perfect copy from there on out.

224
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:51,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the monitor can't really do the monitor itself can't do any sort of decryption or Yet any.

225
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,860
Speaker 1: yeah, it can't do anything.

226
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:56,198
Speaker 1: All it can do is take a raw video signal and display it.

227
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:14,339
Speaker 1: So because it gets a rod a video signal plugged into it via a wire of some sorts You can make a device which takes in that raw video signal and writes it down to some sort of storage like a hard drive or a magnetic tape or what have you and You can copy anything.

228
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,451
Speaker 1: Well, they know that this is a problem.

229
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,255
Speaker 1: it's not a problem.

230
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:19,380
Speaker 1: it's supposed to be that way.

231
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,416
Speaker 1: That's the way it should be the way it is now.

232
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:35,200
Speaker 1: But movie companies and such think this is a problem and they don't want you getting such high resolution copies Copied perfectly because you have a digital connection between your whatever player computer and your monitor.

233
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,353
Speaker 0: Now their solution to this is just a whole new level of ass hattery.

234
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:46,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's called HD CPA HDCP high bandwidth digital content protection HDCP goddamn.

235
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,856
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what it stands for.

236
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:49,000
Speaker 0: It's just like the CBD tPA.

237
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:56,235
Speaker 0: I still remember what that stands for CCCA, I don't know what they called it CBD tPA CD BTPA whatever.

238
00:17:56,416 --> 00:18:00,212
Speaker 0: it's all bad consumer Broadband and digital fuck it, whatever.

239
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:01,740
Speaker 0: Yeah something that sucks.

240
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:28,720
Speaker 1: So what they're gonna do is they're gonna make monitors that are HD CP Like this monitor has HD CP and then they'll say this video card has HD CP or this DVD player has HD CP and this cable box is HD CP and only things that have HD CP will plugged into things that have HD CP will allow you to use the ultra high resolutions.

241
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:34,280
Speaker 0: So they'll make sure that the analog hole is mostly closed or they won't give you the high bandwidth high resolution.

242
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,747
Speaker 1: The way it will work is your.

243
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:40,628
Speaker 1: let's say I have an HD CP DVD player and HD CP LCD HD TV.

244
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:41,956
Speaker 1: television was a lot of letters.

245
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:58,198
Speaker 1: Player will read the disc will encrypt it send it to the TV The TV will decrypt it and display it so that if I tried to record What came out of the DVD player to a device it would be all encrypted and I don't have to decrypt it somehow.

246
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,631
Speaker 0: now I'm not of course.

247
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:14,360
Speaker 0: either Do some magic electronics and hook something up to the cathode ray tube and get the data from there and reconstruct it or you know point a video camera That's synced up properly at the monitor, but you're still gonna lose a lot and they don't care about that.

248
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:24,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you unless you break this encryption somehow It's going to be pretty difficult to get the exact data of the high-resolution video copied to something else.

249
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:32,670
Speaker 0: no, this doesn't seem so bad on its own because you know, all right, they're doing this to us fuckers and Both ATI and Nvidia have.

250
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:35,100
Speaker 0: they have support already and all their new GPUs.

251
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:48,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, even like I think on the level of CPUs like AMD and Intel is this support I think well The main article like the main thing we're gonna talk about is that ATI and Nvidia all their cards now say they support this And you know what?

252
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,320
Speaker 0: That's a goddamn lie.

253
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:51,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

254
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,458
Speaker 1: Well, here's what's gonna happen.

255
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,851
Speaker 1: Apparently if you this this is not.

256
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:57,694
Speaker 1: I don't have a hundred.

257
00:19:57,734 --> 00:20:00,223
Speaker 1: this isn't 100% sure information but it's pretty sure.

258
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:12,560
Speaker 1: if you buy like an Nvidia video card in the store that has HDCP and Build a computer with it and plug it into an HDCP monitor, by the way There's not really so many HDCP monitors.

259
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,828
Speaker 1: I don't think there are actually any.

260
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,579
Speaker 1: there might be very very few like.

261
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,437
Speaker 0: well I know is I will not be buying 100. fuck you all ever.

262
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:23,504
Speaker 1: Yeah They They won't work.

263
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:30,132
Speaker 1: if you buy an HDCP video card and make a computer with it It won't work even though it says it on the box.

264
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,060
Speaker 0: It says HDCP on the box.

265
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,211
Speaker 0: It says it in the manual.

266
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,120
Speaker 0: It says it on their website.

267
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,357
Speaker 0: It says it supports it because it does support it.

268
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:37,985
Speaker 0: But not really.

269
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:47,720
Speaker 1: it only supports it won't support it because if you're the kind of person who builds a computer Then that means you're the kind of person who can probably you know break it or copy it so they won't make it work.

270
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:59,725
Speaker 0: So basically you'll only be able to use HDCP protected content if you buy an HDCP monitor and you buy a dollar gateway or an HDCP TV or a Sony Sony computer.

271
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:01,674
Speaker 0: so basically there's be computer.

272
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:08,020
Speaker 0: They've realized that Hobbyists and people like us will always find a way around whatever shenanigans they try to pull.

273
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,495
Speaker 0: So they're just pulling the plug on us hobbyists and only providing this content to.

274
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:14,060
Speaker 0: you know, the mouth breathers now.

275
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,520
Speaker 1: Here's the worst thing In Vista.

276
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,113
Speaker 1: Here's another great story about Oh God fucking Windows Vista.

277
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,080
Speaker 1: It's gonna be all HDCP action.

278
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:34,060
Speaker 1: So you're not gonna even be able to do You know the full resolution that's possible to do Perhaps for your computer's power unless you have an HDCP video card and HDCP monitor.

279
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:43,820
Speaker 0: So they're enforcing this arbitrary standard to trick you into getting a thing that will prevent you from watching things You want to watch later or at least watching them at high resolution?

280
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:53,040
Speaker 1: So you have the highest resolution monitor in the world and the most powerful video card in the world and the most powerful computer in The world but it will only go up to a certain resolution.

281
00:21:53,141 --> 00:22:05,088
Speaker 1: You'll only be able to play games and watch movies up to a certain resolution Unless they're HDCP enabled video card and monitor on a pre-built computer And thus you won't be able to copy anything now.

282
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,633
Speaker 0: here is why I don't care.

283
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:07,716
Speaker 0: This is rims.

284
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,020
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit section.

285
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,014
Speaker 0: I'm even gonna make some music for this in the future because whenever something like this comes up I always give my rant at the end about you know what.

286
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:16,980
Speaker 0: here's why I don't give a shit.

287
00:22:17,342 --> 00:22:18,330
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna make that a bit.

288
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:19,660
Speaker 0: I just thought of that right now.

289
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,503
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get my own freaking.

290
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:21,005
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit.

291
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:29,474
Speaker 0: music and everything alright, but basically music has to just sound like yeah Okay, I don't care what the fuck you're all bad to put you saying that.

292
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,260
Speaker 1: you put you saying stuff like that over it.

293
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:32,164
Speaker 0: Maybe I will.

294
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:33,510
Speaker 0: yeah, I'll make a little jingle.

295
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,780
Speaker 0: I'll play a little ditty on the piano, and I'll sing something.

296
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, give me a few weeks to put that together.

297
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:40,960
Speaker 1: sound terrible with you singing, but hey I can sing a little bit.

298
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,345
Speaker 0: I can sing anyone.

299
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:46,960
Speaker 0: any song where there are no more than three unique notes in that song I can sing it fucking great.

300
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,559
Speaker 0: Hey get outside of that, and I have some issues.

301
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:53,114
Speaker 0: But all right the reason I don't care is that one.

302
00:22:53,636 --> 00:23:04,146
Speaker 0: this only affects HDCP protected content and I've noticed that almost everything I watch is Either old cold crap technology.

303
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:09,882
Speaker 0: You know like DVDs VHS whatever or it's something pirated that I just download from the internet anyway Mm-hmm.

304
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,646
Speaker 0: I can watch that or whatever resolution.

305
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:13,030
Speaker 0: I want HDCP or not.

306
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:17,220
Speaker 0: yep - I have no interest in any of this new content.

307
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:21,472
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy videos from someone like Google or Microsoft.

308
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,718
Speaker 0: I'm gonna watch the funny things on Google video for free.

309
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:27,868
Speaker 0: yep I'm not gonna buy on HD CD.

310
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:34,529
Speaker 0: Whatever I'm gonna download a freaking mp3 or a fleck mm-hmm and This has never anything to do with audio.

311
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,899
Speaker 0: This is high-resolution video, but blu-ray HD DVD.

312
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:42,779
Speaker 0: I note that current DVD is already more than enough as far as I'm concerned mm-hmm.

313
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,654
Speaker 0: so I really have no desire for blu-ray at all.

314
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,044
Speaker 0: and Why would upgrade normally?

315
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:52,460
Speaker 0: because blu-ray is better except for all this DRM bullshit, so that's the end of that.

316
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:58,820
Speaker 0: I'm pretty much gonna stop in terms of consumer entertainment technology as soon as this stuff comes into play.

317
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,540
Speaker 1: We just got a new TV, so you're not replacing that anytime soon.

318
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, our TV is not even HD because HD just isn't even really a standard anymore.

319
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:08,050
Speaker 0: It's just this DRM encumbered pile of.

320
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,980
Speaker 1: it's not DRM encumbered yet yet.

321
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:15,418
Speaker 0: However as soon as the DRM stuff comes out all the old HD TV HD TV won't even work.

322
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:24,257
Speaker 1: with the new stuff we don't really even have anything that would output HD because what we don't have a Cable box yeah, we don't have blu-ray, and we never will.

323
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:29,176
Speaker 1: yeah The only thing we would ever have that would be HD is like if we got an Xbox 360 or ps3 for free.

324
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:34,397
Speaker 0: Oh, but it turns out that half the Xbox 360 games aren't really HD either.

325
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:35,220
Speaker 0: They're just up sampled.

326
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:44,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, and we really wanted we could get that crazy DVD player that up samples everything for you Whatever, but so seriously don't protest.

327
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:48,291
Speaker 0: revolution won't be HD Yeah, but don't write letters to people.

328
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:49,940
Speaker 0: this isn't a law or anything.

329
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,096
Speaker 0: Don't don't do the stuff that people always do when acronyms like this come out.

330
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:55,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a law.

331
00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:57,376
Speaker 1: It's a technology that they're trying to make.

332
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,152
Speaker 0: yeah Devices use you know what.

333
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:00,999
Speaker 0: let it come.

334
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:12,586
Speaker 0: This is only gonna hurt people and then once people start getting hurt by this stuff They're gonna start caring and that'll be the end of that, and if they don't start caring just live your life free of Consumer entertainment.

335
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,899
Speaker 1: I have a feeling what's gonna happen is that?

336
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,459
Speaker 1: People might buy like a DVD player with HDCP, and they might buy a TV with it.

337
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:25,819
Speaker 1: But they won't know if they have a mismatch and they won't care like they'll think it's HD or whatever they you know.

338
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,023
Speaker 0: What was that statistic?

339
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:32,600
Speaker 0: something like 50 or 60 percent of people who have HD TVs aren't actually watching HDTV because they didn't hook it.

340
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:37,738
Speaker 1: Yes, or they don't know or they don't notice yeah, and they think it's HD TV because the TVs do look better.

341
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:42,120
Speaker 1: just default Way the technology is supposed to function.

342
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,420
Speaker 1: Theoretically is that if you don't have the HDCP support that it would just go with the lower resolution.

343
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:49,760
Speaker 0: So you don't even know it's broken?

344
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might.

345
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:52,875
Speaker 1: there might be some sort of message.

346
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:53,338
Speaker 1: who knows?

347
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:59,460
Speaker 0: plus I point out that there's so much more and more content is coming out on the internet that isn't protected by anything.

348
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:01,977
Speaker 0: I mean we're gonna put DRM on our podcast.

349
00:26:02,198 --> 00:26:07,440
Speaker 1: yeah I mean I listen to more podcasts than I ever watch TV even when I was a crazy TV watcher.

350
00:26:07,822 --> 00:26:10,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean and it's just those are just mp3s.

351
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,108
Speaker 1: I don't have to worry about crap like this.

352
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:16,079
Speaker 0: yeah anime ski various torrent sites You can get all the entertainment you need from the internet.

353
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:21,460
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like you're gonna prevent me from copying the stuff that I don't watch anyway.

354
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:31,750
Speaker 0: Fantastic yeah, so things of the day.

355
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:56,649
Speaker 0: I I found this a long time ago, and I was really stretching for a thing of the day today And then I used this site because I use it often for reasons I'm not going to get into but they're much nerdier than you would expect And it's basically just a nice Gathering of all sorts of British slang and it explains what these phrases mean and how to use it.

356
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:58,038
Speaker 0: That's it.

357
00:26:58,804 --> 00:26:59,207
Speaker 1: That's it.

358
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:13,829
Speaker 0: Yeah It's really cool and really useful if you happen to be playing a a cockney kind of British Thug person who's also a fairy dragon in a Dungeons & Dragons game because you're a nerd like me.

359
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:15,355
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly like you.

360
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:15,455
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:26,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought it was cool and - cuz we actually it's funny But we have multiple listeners in the UK and in Australia and places which we didn't expect, but I think is awesome.

362
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:28,810
Speaker 1: You ever see the third Austin Powers movie?

363
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:30,653
Speaker 0: Gold member.

364
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:31,135
Speaker 0: Yeah.

365
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:32,158
Speaker 1: No, I never.

366
00:27:32,198 --> 00:27:35,350
Speaker 1: actually I think I saw the whole thing, but I didn't really pay attention to the whole thing.

367
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:44,970
Speaker 1: But there's one part where Austin and his dad are there and they say and it's like wait, we're both British Let's speak proper or something like that.

368
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:51,110
Speaker 1: And then they start talking in a way where you can't possibly comprehend anything they're saying and there are subtitles.

369
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,710
Speaker 1: You know, but it's like the crazy British blah.

370
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:57,665
Speaker 1: You know where they use other words in places of other words.

371
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:58,730
Speaker 1: You just don't know what the hell's going.

372
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,322
Speaker 0: Cockney rhyming slang.

373
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:01,349
Speaker 0: I actually learned it.

374
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:10,570
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell it was But it was just nuts and there was subtitles and it was funny Because I read a bunch of cockney rhyming slang and then I figured out what was going on.

375
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,089
Speaker 0: And now I get it and it's actually kind of clever.

376
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,224
Speaker 0: The problem is because actually a couple weeks ago.

377
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:22,366
Speaker 0: I did it at work I made a little funny slang like that because it's really kind of a cool bait.

378
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:24,676
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna explain it it's real simple.

379
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:29,942
Speaker 0: basically I did it and I said something and I don't think Americans can really get it.

380
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,914
Speaker 0: I Just don't.

381
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:32,215
Speaker 0: I can't

382
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:33,281
Speaker 1: even get it and I'm smart

383
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:45,370
Speaker 0: if I explained it to you Which I'll do off the air or maybe I'll do it on the air if we ever do a show on like language or slang Or anything like that, you know, it's it's not difficult and it's actually really clever I think

384
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:46,591
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

385
00:28:47,313 --> 00:28:55,079
Speaker 0: but I thought this was cool because basically I play this character and I use it to type in a very authentic way Cuz I yeah, I also play the game online.

386
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,425
Speaker 0: So doubly geeky.

387
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:57,108
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

388
00:28:57,288 --> 00:29:11,019
Speaker 1: Triply really, so Unlike most geeks, I think at least I'm pretty sure I'm a fan of you know, Godzilla He goes, you know kaiju big battle.

389
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,683
Speaker 1: Well kaiju big vowel doesn't.

390
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:15,290
Speaker 1: I guess it kind of whatever it involves kaiju.

391
00:29:15,611 --> 00:29:16,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's for sure.

392
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:17,663
Speaker 0: That's all that matters.

393
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:23,505
Speaker 1: So My favorite guy is Ghidorah which is the three-headed dragon guy.

394
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,030
Speaker 0: really I'm more of a Mothra man.

395
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mothra mother is my second favorite.

396
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:32,901
Speaker 1: In fact, even though Ghidorah is my favorite monster I will say that the best movie is Godzilla vs.

397
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:33,343
Speaker 1: Mothra.

398
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:35,129
Speaker 1: that is that is guaranteed.

399
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:52,310
Speaker 1: anyway The thing is there's a book in the from a long time ago, I think from 1967 called The anatom an anatomical guide to monsters as a Japanese book and it contains all the monsters like cut open.

400
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,004
Speaker 1: So you can see they're innards.

401
00:29:55,024 --> 00:30:01,428
Speaker 0: Oh, that's kind of like that thing A guy did a while ago where he made the internal skeletal structures of a whole bunch of cartoon characters.

402
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:02,978
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I like that.

403
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:03,989
Speaker 0: That's pretty badass.

404
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:09,346
Speaker 1: So there's a picture here from an old Japanese book that shows like where Gamera's brain is.

405
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:12,447
Speaker 0: does Gamera have a lightning sack of some kind?

406
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,690
Speaker 1: I Don't know but he's got like these four.

407
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:22,290
Speaker 1: It seems like they're digestive portions, but they might not be one of the breath weapon generators.

408
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:25,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of them seems to have red stuff.

409
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,901
Speaker 1: one of them has.

410
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:27,225
Speaker 1: it seems like a red liquid.

411
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:39,857
Speaker 1: one has a white powder One is some black bits and one has some other sort of white rocky bits And I think that those combined with this other gland over here He like he must cough him

412
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:43,289
Speaker 0: up and then you're already putting more thought into this than you should be.

413
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,324
Speaker 1: That's why this is the thing of the day and it's so cool.

414
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:47,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is so.

415
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:59,977
Speaker 0: if you're wondering what Gamera's guts look like and and you're not man enough to cut him open and look So, uh We totally copped out today.

416
00:30:59,997 --> 00:31:01,282
Speaker 0: We don't have anything to talk about.

417
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:03,210
Speaker 0: That's why we kind of went long in the news bits.

418
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:04,474
Speaker 1: We suck.

419
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:08,590
Speaker 0: we were gonna talk about DRM, but we're still tired from freaking over Khan.

420
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we cuz DRM kind of tied into the other news.

421
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,370
Speaker 0: But all we could say about DRM is that it's bad and we hate it.

422
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,215
Speaker 0: But we don't care cuz it doesn't affect us.

423
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:18,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just sucks.

424
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,642
Speaker 0: So yeah, that was it.

425
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:20,484
Speaker 0: That's the show today.

426
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:23,192
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm fire bad Dr.

427
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:26,322
Speaker 1: I mean after the drive home Saturday, we're still totally shot.

428
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:26,523
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:31,174
Speaker 0: So for those of you who don't live in the Northeast corridor We went to UberCon.

430
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:34,463
Speaker 0: we drove there Saturday morning and we left Sunday morning.

431
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:41,450
Speaker 1: well Saturday night basically midnight Yeah, 1230 to be exact and we knew there was gonna be a crazy snow, whatever.

432
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:47,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know it's gonna snow, but we hadn't really looked and it was actually a huge fucking blizzard.

433
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:49,397
Speaker 1: Well, I knew it was gonna be huge fucking blizzard.

434
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:52,087
Speaker 0: I guess we just didn't prepare our things.

435
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:52,890
Speaker 1: I didn't care.

436
00:31:53,753 --> 00:31:55,421
Speaker 1: I just drive home and it'll be alright.

437
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we actually got on the road.

438
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:00,869
Speaker 1: We had to go like 20 30 miles an hour the whole way.

439
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:04,370
Speaker 0: There were no other cars other than there's one car that almost spun out and hit us.

440
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,069
Speaker 1: No, I was driving in a brand new car.

441
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:10,244
Speaker 1: The worst thing about anything was that it couldn't see the lines on the road.

442
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,910
Speaker 1: That was the absolute worst part of it.

443
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,997
Speaker 0: Oh and SUVs passing us at like 60.

444
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:14,117
Speaker 0: Yeah.

445
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:15,783
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

446
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:17,228
Speaker 0: There's three inches of snow on the ground.

447
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:17,890
Speaker 0: They can't break.

448
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:19,479
Speaker 0: They're sliding all over the place.

449
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:21,994
Speaker 0: They almost hit us, but now they can go 60.

450
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:32,190
Speaker 0: There was nothing worse than not being able to see the lines Because I Submit that it was worse to be lost in Jersey unable to find the Garden State because Jersey does not have signs for its roads.

451
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,414
Speaker 1: Surgeons of signs.

452
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:36,989
Speaker 1: the signs all suck and you can't make a u-turn without going on some wacky road.

453
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:37,970
Speaker 0: So sure Here's our dilemma.

454
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:44,270
Speaker 0: We're on a road and we see a little green circle sign that says Garden State Parkway this way exit.

455
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:48,343
Speaker 0: So we get on this little exit and we follow the exit to its conclusion.

456
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,230
Speaker 0: We see no more signs along this exit.

457
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:58,834
Speaker 0: The exit took us back to the same road where we then saw the same exit again, so he tried it again Sure enough.

458
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:01,530
Speaker 1: There's a sign that says turn right for the Garden State.

459
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,314
Speaker 1: So he turned right.

460
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,107
Speaker 1: after we turn right we can have to go straight or right.

461
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:05,469
Speaker 1: we can.

462
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:10,741
Speaker 1: you know There's two ways to go and it doesn't say which one of those is the Garden State and both of us taken back to the same fucking road.

463
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:12,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucked.

464
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,320
Speaker 0: we'd read went around it like three times.

465
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:16,690
Speaker 0: then we just gave up and parked in a parking lot for a minute.

466
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:18,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a recruit.

467
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was hellish to a gas station to recoup again.

468
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,966
Speaker 1: Then I just kept going down the road until I got onto 87 north.

469
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:27,456
Speaker 0: We figured we just keep heading north.

470
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:28,460
Speaker 0: the worst case.

471
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,230
Speaker 0: we hit i-84 because it goes across the whole frickin country.

472
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:32,537
Speaker 1: This is all country.

473
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,710
Speaker 0: It goes across the whole country as far as we're concerned.

474
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,261
Speaker 0: Yeah, we tried to go past a spot where our i-84 is doesn't exist.

475
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:39,806
Speaker 0: We're lost.

476
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:41,110
Speaker 0: We're in like, Tennessee.

477
00:33:41,532 --> 00:33:44,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we might have just 84 it we could have gone on some road.

478
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:50,851
Speaker 1: We're like 84 just kind of went on a little bridge over us or we went over it on a bridge and then we didn't Even know.

479
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:51,955
Speaker 0: yeah, and you know what.

480
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:52,878
Speaker 0: then we did Canada.

481
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:54,384
Speaker 0: They have to stop us at the border.

482
00:33:54,725 --> 00:34:00,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, then we'd be alright Not to mention the fact that we've been gaming all day.

483
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:03,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had just finished a four-hour game which was like about tomorrow.

484
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of the best for our games ever.

485
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,719
Speaker 1: So we're shot to this week, but we do have.

486
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:12,588
Speaker 1: we're good for like two or three more weeks now.

487
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:13,210
Speaker 1: We've got stuff.

488
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:18,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, like tomorrow uber con straight up like a whole day of uber con Wednesday.

489
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:20,989
Speaker 0: We've seen some frickin anime too many anime.

490
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:26,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, there may or may not be a show Thursday because I'm going out of town again this time for katsu con.

491
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,795
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not a cop-out.

492
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,181
Speaker 1: That's not here.

493
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:31,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, so been regardless.

494
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:36,989
Speaker 0: You'll probably get an extra long week next week and you'll probably get an extra long show tomorrow.

495
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,563
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus all these cons will bring really quality episodes.

496
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:47,907
Speaker 0: when we talk about what happened at the cons Yeah, I mean uber con lat this previous weekend katsu con this coming weekend New York comic-con the next weekend.

497
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:48,969
Speaker 0: the weekend after that.

498
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,786
Speaker 0: We might have all our friends in the world coming to our house and messing it up like we tend to have.

499
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:54,514
Speaker 1: I think the non Con is that weekend?

500
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:55,096
Speaker 1: I got a check.

503
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,391
Speaker 1: We got to see.

504
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:01,578
Speaker 0: yeah, at least all the other cons are far off.

505
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,565
Speaker 0: I mean kinetic cons aways out yet.

506
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:05,170
Speaker 0: Oh two cons aways out.

507
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

508
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:08,679
Speaker 1: It's con season.

509
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,709
Speaker 1: So good episodes, even though we might miss a few like this.

510
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:25,090
Speaker 0: Though keep in mind that katsu con if I get a thing in time I'm gonna be interviewing some people there just for the show about cons, whatever but starting with Tora con We're gonna be doing full-on live shows at these conventions.

511
00:35:25,544 --> 00:35:33,188
Speaker 1: Yeah So don't be surprised if an mp3 gets downloaded on a Saturday or a Sunday from your feed reader Catcher or whatever you got going on.

512
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:37,784
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz once we start we're gonna start going to these cons in an official capacity soon.

513
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:40,370
Speaker 0: all the cars we've gone to now We were gonna go to anyway.

514
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,190
Speaker 0: We just happen to be doing a podcast so we might talk about it at the con, but we're not there as geek nights.

515
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:48,465
Speaker 0: We're going to these cons coming up as geek nights like rim and Scott.

516
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,549
Speaker 0: Where are those two guys?

517
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,658
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That's all we got today's.

518
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:55,543
Speaker 0: today's a loss.

519
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:57,070
Speaker 0: Thursday may or may not be a loss.

520
00:35:57,472 --> 00:36:06,489
Speaker 0: I guarantee tomorrow be worth listening to because while it's gonna be a gaming day We we did a lot of stuff that I think everyone wants to hear about.

521
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,797
Speaker 1: Everyone needs a week off.

522
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:13,990
Speaker 1: I mean the fact that we do four podcasts a week is insane compared to most people.

523
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:19,070
Speaker 0: This is our 58th podcast not counting the ten or so we did before we put the site up.

524
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:22,489
Speaker 1: There are podcasts that have been going for years and years and years.

525
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:29,713
Speaker 1: Well, not years but over a year at least that are still on episode like they just managed to get episode 50 People do.

526
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:38,190
Speaker 1: weekly podcasts who've been doing it for a year are on episode 52 We're on 58 and we've been going for like a few months.

527
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:45,413
Speaker 0: That's why we're adding those feeds for all the different days because our anime day is a whole anime podcast basically Mm-hmm.

528
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:46,158
Speaker 0: We just it's.

529
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:48,230
Speaker 0: basically we're doing four separate podcasts.

530
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:55,346
Speaker 0: Yep, and the fact that we're not dead yet I think really speaks highly the fact that we can take abuse and stay up late every night.

531
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:56,069
Speaker 0: I don't know.

532
00:36:56,512 --> 00:36:57,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I don't know how we do this.

533
00:36:58,284 --> 00:36:59,109
Speaker 1: I do it laying down.

534
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:05,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, I sit in my chair anyway, so yeah when I redo this site Everything should be easier.

535
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:12,684
Speaker 1: and if you have any questions, you're not sure how podcast subscribing works I guess you might not be listening then.

536
00:37:12,745 --> 00:37:23,008
Speaker 0: but yeah, though we're starting to see more and more people are moving to the feed so you guys are either learning how to use feed things or We're getting new listeners and you guys are leaving or I don't know.

537
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:28,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't know how to use podcast feeds just ask us or something.

538
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:33,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, if enough people ask let's do a show on how podcasts work like on a fundamental level.

539
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:35,901
Speaker 1: Oh and in the forum There's a thread.

540
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:40,229
Speaker 1: it's sticky It's at the top and it says like introduce yourself or something like that.

541
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,844
Speaker 0: Don't feel obligated to because I know a lot of people lurk I lurk.

542
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,390
Speaker 0: I mean I still lurk to this day.

543
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:45,932
Speaker 0: I've read a cut.

544
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:54,359
Speaker 0: there's a webcomic called college rumors from hell that I've read for the last like six years and I lurk in the forums to this day.

545
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,363
Speaker 0: I have never posted.

546
00:37:55,866 --> 00:38:01,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, but You don't have to go and say who you are whatever if you don't want to.

547
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:06,230
Speaker 1: But I think it'd be really cool if everyone said who they were in there because all the people I mean even the ones who?

548
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,093
Speaker 0: Haven't done publicly.

549
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,965
Speaker 0: the people we've gotten to know in our forums are really cool.

550
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:16,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of them I say 99% of them actually the only ones who might not be cool are ones that we already know.

551
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:21,289
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and now that everyone out there is trying to figure out is he talking about me?

552
00:38:22,412 --> 00:38:24,230
Speaker 0: No, if you're thinking that we're not talking about you.

553
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:32,110
Speaker 1: Also, you might notice that on the right side of the home page right now under my links Scott's links There's a frapper map.

554
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:38,266
Speaker 1: It's been there for a long time But you can go in there and say where you're from and it'll put a little like a thumbtack on.

555
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:39,029
Speaker 0: I totally forgot.

556
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:39,672
Speaker 0: you set That up.

557
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, I totally forgot also.

558
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:41,820
Speaker 1: I just thought of it.

559
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:48,570
Speaker 0: Just yeah, believe me once we set the site up more We're gonna have like our own flicker like just for geek nights and all this sort of stuff.

560
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,920
Speaker 0: That's gonna bring the little community around the show together.

561
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna remake this site to be super awesome.

562
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,717
Speaker 1: I'm working on it at home.

563
00:38:54,778 --> 00:38:57,030
Speaker 1: And as soon as it's ready, I can upload it in the switch.

564
00:38:57,411 --> 00:39:08,230
Speaker 0: You won't even notice because it'll be so seamless and we got a whole bunch of artists working in their part-time Kind of toward getting us some cool logos and we're gonna get rid of that geek nights neon thing.

565
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:13,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna get a real logo that doesn't suck and you'll have little pictures on your iPods and everything.

566
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:30,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, if any of you out there are artistically inclined and you want to add to the pool I can't promise we'll use whatever logo you come up with with for us but one if you need reference photos we can provide them and To if we ever make t-shirts or anything anyone who's art we use or anyone who freaking sent us art I'll probably get a free one.

567
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,282
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyone who I'll tell you what.

568
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:37,595
Speaker 1: everyone who has some sort of logo making ability.

569
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:48,350
Speaker 1: if you try to make the geek night's logo, which should be Something that looks good in a square because we have to use square pictures for iPod picture

570
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:54,089
Speaker 0: For the site like our big graphics we actually have people who are working on those really so don't worry about that.

571
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, well not like.

572
00:39:55,567 --> 00:40:04,181
Speaker 1: oh, yeah If you want to do something that's like the identifying trademark logo of geek nights if you can come up with it And it's good then you'll win something.

573
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,610
Speaker 1: We'll give you some awesome something that's worth it.

574
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,655
Speaker 0: Well, let me put it this way.

575
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:12,158
Speaker 0: You won't use a lot of bandwidth and a lot of time Between the two of us.

576
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,199
Speaker 0: We're actually fairly wealthy Like we're not wealthy in terms of.

577
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,570
Speaker 0: you know wealthy people don't have mansions and Ferraris.

578
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,281
Speaker 0: No, we'd like them, but we do not want for geekery at all.

579
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:25,470
Speaker 0: so we can come up with some fairly awesome prizes.

580
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:35,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean just think about like something that you've been dying to buy like I don't know video game or maybe a manga comic Some like.

581
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:43,207
Speaker 0: even better if you guys get the word out if we hit a thousand listeners We'll put together some sort of awesome prize, and then we'll give it to someone somehow.

582
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:48,439
Speaker 1: yeah so Try to make a geek night's logo of awesome.

583
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you can't tell we're just kind of filling in here.

584
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:56,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, heading out the podcast a little it better than no podcast like some people.

585
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:58,537
Speaker 0: yeah Cuz you know there are nights.

586
00:40:58,597 --> 00:40:59,723
Speaker 0: I mean half most nights.

587
00:40:59,764 --> 00:41:00,206
Speaker 0: We come home.

588
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:02,019
Speaker 0: We're like yeah I'm talking about this and this and this.

589
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:08,310
Speaker 0: the podcast can be freaking awesome But every now and then we come home when we sit here like god damn it Let's just not do one, but we do it anyway.

590
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,136
Speaker 1: I don't know how penny arcade does it.

591
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:14,110
Speaker 1: not only do they consistently do three nights a week, but it's always awesome.

592
00:41:14,492 --> 00:41:16,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there seem to be two philosophy well three philosophies.

593
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:27,390
Speaker 0: There's the third philosophy of just put crap out and it sucks, but like penny arcade They consistently produce something awesome, and they force themselves to nothing better than that.

594
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:33,483
Speaker 0: But then there's like Perry Bible fellowship which updates whenever But it only updates when the guy has a great idea and does it.

595
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:38,164
Speaker 0: so every one is a perfect gem Always quality, but you never know when.

596
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,636
Speaker 1: yeah Then we have ours.

597
00:41:41,057 --> 00:41:43,667
Speaker 1: we always do it no matter what and sometimes.

598
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,176
Speaker 1: It's good sometimes It's yeah like.

599
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:51,670
Speaker 0: honestly recently someone reviewed geek nights And they happen to listen to two episodes where we just bitched at each other and argued yep.

600
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:56,566
Speaker 0: So I guess the fact that he still had fairly positive feelings toward us was a good sign.

601
00:41:56,586 --> 00:42:05,860
Speaker 0: I think so I mean we At least now that Scott drives to work instead of taking the train and he leaves late And then he leaves work early.

602
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,210
Speaker 0: We have a lot more time now.

603
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,436
Speaker 1: You know how long that last is.

604
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:09,340
Speaker 1: no one at the office.

605
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,521
Speaker 1: now.

606
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:11,530
Speaker 1: supposedly more people are gonna be there.

607
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,678
Speaker 1: So we'll see what happens when more.

608
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see what happens if I end up working in the city instead of where I work now.

609
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:23,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we'll see what happens if more people work at the office that I work at eventually because then I might not be able To just run away from it.

610
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:29,710
Speaker 0: But I can tell you we're gonna keep doing four days a week because everyone who everyone actually gives us feedback says it's great.

611
00:42:30,511 --> 00:42:36,782
Speaker 0: We've never had anyone give us bad feedback, so if you don't like geek nights tell us Because we're just assuming we're awesome.

612
00:42:36,923 --> 00:42:40,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you don't like it This will probably be the only episode you've ever listened to and ever do listen to.

613
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:46,029
Speaker 1: If that's the case listen to another one, please because this one's not so good.

614
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:48,506
Speaker 0: What was a really good episode we did?

615
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,326
Speaker 0: Most of the ones on anime are good.

616
00:42:52,753 --> 00:42:55,613
Speaker 0: Most of the reviews of video games are good Mm-hmm.

617
00:42:56,157 --> 00:43:05,450
Speaker 0: actually the one pot just from Google You know poking around our most linked to podcast is the one we did on Pseudoscience when we had our guest scientist Peter Olson.

618
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:06,352
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

619
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:10,350
Speaker 0: I mean we're gonna have Pete on the show more because Pete is a. he's a good friend of ours.

620
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:18,318
Speaker 0: independent of that he's a. he's a fairly respected scientist at a government agency and That's a great way of spinning it.

621
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, well.

622
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,009
Speaker 0: He's respected by the people who know him.

623
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he does work for a government agency, and he is a scientist.

624
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:25,610
Speaker 0: I in no way lied.

625
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,175
Speaker 1: No, you in no way lied.

626
00:43:27,215 --> 00:43:31,248
Speaker 1: however people misinterpret that and think like you know what I'm a friggin spin doctor.

627
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:31,729
Speaker 0: What do you want?

628

640
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:22,481
Speaker 0: They're not particularly insightful, but everyone who gives us feedback Just says that we're bastards because we send them down some sort of horrible Nostalgia fest and then they try to find all their old toys and play with them.

641
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:24,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely nostalgia in the house.

642
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:27,036

652
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:48,435
Speaker 1: Yeah the slow one It wasn't that good.

653
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,407
Speaker 1: It was slow, but it was better than most.

654
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:59,046
Speaker 0: yeah See you're getting a peek now all you listeners out there into what we talk about when we're not on the air Because we're just kind of talking it when we're trying to figure out what to talk about.

655
00:44:59,186 --> 00:45:01,809
Speaker 0: yeah someday I think we're gonna do an episode.

656
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:04,301
Speaker 0: We'll do two episodes, but on Monday.

657
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:07,214
Speaker 0: We'll do the episode and on Thursday We'll play back.

658
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:11,605
Speaker 0: the recording will make of us talking about what we're gonna do in the episode Mm-hmm.

659
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:15,729
Speaker 0: I think that would be a good set episodes cuz actually we just Monday we did.

660
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:17,157
Speaker 0: I don't know well.

661
00:45:17,198 --> 00:45:18,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the thing is we're doing it now.

662
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:20,795
Speaker 0: Oh my god Yeah, but there have been two.

663
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:29,484
Speaker 0: the two biggest things that people have requested of me of geek nights that we do a show about Is one people keep asking me to do a show on how to do a podcast.

664
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:30,587
Speaker 0: like what equipment we use?

665
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:31,189
Speaker 0: yeah?

666
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,140
Speaker 1: There's so many podcasts.

667
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,490
Speaker 1: That's have that information.

668
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,344
Speaker 1: Here's the thing and there's so many websites that have been information.

669
00:45:37,465 --> 00:45:43,526
Speaker 0: half those websites Honestly just give wrong or bad information or bad advice or the people don't know what they're talking about.

670
00:45:43,947 --> 00:45:48,890
Speaker 0: and the other half Assume that you have infinite money, and they're just like yeah, buy this buy this buy this.

671
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,210
Speaker 0: So when we finally do that episode?

672
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:57,052
Speaker 0: We can tell you how to do an awesome podcast that sounds at least as good as geek nights for less than $200.

673
00:45:57,052 --> 00:46:03,886
Speaker 1: yeah the thing is if your podcast You don't you mean doesn't even have to be as quality as ours.

674
00:46:03,926 --> 00:46:10,430
Speaker 1: a lot of the podcasts I listen to which are more popular than this one are made with less money and less equipment and sound shittier.

675
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:11,857
Speaker 1: It's all about the content.

676
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:14,610
Speaker 1: You know the content is so good that I can suffer there.

677
00:46:15,457 --> 00:46:17,009
Speaker 1: You know slightly less quality audio.

678
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:22,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the only reason our sounds as good as it does is just that we actually do know more than a little bit.

679
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:26,954
Speaker 0: We have a look we have enough knowledge to be dangerous when it comes to audio crap And we're learning a lot.

680
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:27,195
Speaker 0: if you

681
00:46:27,215 --> 00:46:39,330
Speaker 1: want to make a podcast all you really have to do is plug a microphone into your computer fiddle with the recording volume So you don't go too crazy loud or too crazy quiet that no one can hear or that it breaks all the time with too loud.

682
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:43,022
Speaker 1: You said it just right and then you push record and you talk.

683
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:45,490
Speaker 1: then you turn the wave into an mp3 and you upload it.

684
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,312
Speaker 0: Yep, that's it.

685
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:54,364
Speaker 0: and if you want to go one step above that by just buy like a $20 microphone from RadioShack Because that'll beat the crap out of the $5 microphone.

686
00:46:54,384 --> 00:46:54,947
Speaker 0: You've got now.

687
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,316
Speaker 1: Yep I mean the logic headsets.

688
00:46:57,617 --> 00:46:59,182
Speaker 1: microphones actually aren't so bad.

689
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:04,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you get that stick creative Microphone that comes out of the $2 thing.

690
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:05,059
Speaker 1: There's no good.

691
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,167
Speaker 0: That's probably the worst microphone money cannot buy.

692
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:09,198
Speaker 1: yeah All right.

693
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:22,282
Speaker 0: Yeah but the other thing that people in requesting the most is Now I forget because I'm stupid You are huh an episode of a how stupid you are.

694
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:23,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be awesome.

695
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:35,849
Speaker 0: Awesome All right, and the other one that was requested a lot and for all of you since this episode is just blah at this point Anyway, I just cut out a whole section of me sitting there trying to remember what the other most requested one was.

696
00:47:37,111 --> 00:47:39,961
Speaker 0: It was a show that people want to know where we came from.

697
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:40,623
Speaker 0: Like why.

698
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:44,990
Speaker 0: this is the whole story of us in the front row crew Yep, which we could do a show on that.

699
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:51,109
Speaker 0: We've talked about it bit by bit and if you've listened to the whole show Like from the beginning you could probably piece most of it together.

700
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:58,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you don't know what the front row crew is or who we are who our friends are and all that Someday, they'll be.

701
00:47:58,337 --> 00:47:59,507
Speaker 1: it's probably Thursday episode.

702
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:07,138
Speaker 0: on that Yeah We were trying to save episodes from that like that for when we're in rare form because some days we're good to go some days We're not today.

703
