1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,578
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, May 15th.

2
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:12,621
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:13,364
Speaker 2: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:14,848
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,598
Speaker 0: Tonight, Geek Profiles #1 with Thade.

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:36,365
Speaker 0: Okay, so we told you in weeks past that on Thursdays we're gonna start to change it up.

8
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:38,915
Speaker 0: And this is the first Thursday where we're gonna change it up.

9
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:40,060
Speaker 2: Oh, snap.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,883
Speaker 0: Oh, snaps.

11
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:43,800
Speaker 0: We have today a special guest on the Geek Nights.

12
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,799
Speaker 0: Introduce yourself special guest.

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,083
Speaker 1: Good evening, everyone.

14
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:48,684
Speaker 1: It's Thade.

15
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:52,312
Speaker 1: Hopefully, this isn't an entirely unfamiliar voice.

16
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:53,876
Speaker 0: No, well, I don't know.

17
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,483
Speaker 0: People... Do you mind?

18
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,580
Speaker 0: Like, it seems like people are starting to call like Friday Night Partyline, like Geek Nights Friday.

19
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,959
Speaker 0: Is that like upset you or what?

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,280
Speaker 1: The last time that we did the show, though, we had really it was just you guys that were from the forum.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,888
Speaker 1: I mean, Friday Night Partyline originated before I even came to your forum and stuff.

22
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:21,862
Speaker 1: I don't mind what people think about it, but it's not that.

23
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:27,516
Speaker 1: And it's going in a different direction now anyway with the guests that we're adding.

24
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,878
Speaker 0: Much like our Thursday show.

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,060
Speaker 0: It's going in a different direction right this minute.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:44,662
Speaker 0: All right, so I think the general idea here is, at least my idea, is you know, sometimes you get a guest on a show who's like, you know, some sort of famous person and you have to interview them.

27
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:44,943
Speaker 0: Right.

28
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:53,560
Speaker 0: But, you know, I figure, you know, I guess Thade, there is some special things about you and you're, I guess, semi-famous and talented in ways.

29
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,440
Speaker 2: Well, you're so generous.

30
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:56,225
Speaker 0: I am.

31
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:56,738
Speaker 0: I am.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,700
Speaker 0: So magnanimous.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,625
Speaker 0: Look at, I am so benevolent.

34
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:00,829
Speaker 0: Look, look upon.

35
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,270
Speaker 0: All right.

36
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:13,870
Speaker 0: That, you know, my idea is that we could do sort of like these like geek profile kind of things, you know, where we could like ask the same questions or similar questions to like a bunch of different geeky people.

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:27,000
Speaker 0: And you can sort of look at all the different geeks around the world and how they're the same and how they're different, because that's sort of, you know, the core philosophy of Geek Nights is that, look, all these people are geeky and geekiness is awesome and such.

38
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,040
Speaker 0: And also, I think we're going to start it off.

39
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,079
Speaker 0: I told you to get a news in the thing of the day.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,940
Speaker 0: But I forgot that we sort of wanted to can the news on Thursday, which is fine because.

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,140
Speaker 2: Well, maybe not necessarily can it, but have bits other than, oh, my God, we talk about the news.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

43
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:54,560
Speaker 0: And I kind of want to make, you know, obviously when we, you know, when you ever have a guest on the show, it always takes forever.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,099
Speaker 0: You know, it's going to be a long one.

45
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:03,920
Speaker 0: And I kind of want to be able to cook and eat dinner before a reasonable hour, even though I know that's not going to happen because I'm looking at the clock already and it's upsetting.

46
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:11,360
Speaker 0: But you had a very, very interesting news and it gave us an idea for a possible Thursday bit.

47
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:14,199
Speaker 0: So tell us about your news and then we will discuss it.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Speaker 1: My news, Scott, is about trains in India.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,007
Speaker 1: And the headline is Mumbai.

50
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,654
Speaker 1: trains kill 20,000 in five years.

51
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,039
Speaker 0: That's like an insane number, like.

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,262
Speaker 1: Yes.

53
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,359
Speaker 1: Well, you have to imagine what these trains are like.

54
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:35,520
Speaker 1: If they have doors at all, it's unusual.

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,220
Speaker 1: They have barred windows, but no glass.

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,999
Speaker 1: And unlike in Japan, where everybody is really orderly in getting on the train, these trains are just a mob scene every day.

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:57,419
Speaker 1: People are hanging off the roof, they're hanging out of the windows and they're jammed in way beyond any sort of capacity that the trains are designed for.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,980
Speaker 2: I mean, I've seen pictures of these on Fark.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,920
Speaker 2: I mean, they're often an object of ridicule on Fark, but you know that everything is ridiculed on Fark.

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,939
Speaker 2: But you see these things.

61
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:10,520
Speaker 2: And if you just see this picture without context, you would look at it and think, wow, that's a joke.

62
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,980
Speaker 2: That is not an actual daily occurrence.

63
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, it looks like one of those things where it's how many people can you cram in a phone booth, you know?

64
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:22,700
Speaker 1: But here, I mean, 10 people a day are dying on these trains.

65
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:36,020
Speaker 1: So if you think you have a bad commute or your train is messy or you're sitting next to a smelly guy, imagine being crammed in beyond what humans should endure and then risking your life every day.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,800
Speaker 0: I mean, in Japan, they pack them in pretty tight.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,318
Speaker 0: They actually have guys who will push the people into the train, you know, but it's nowhere near this bad, not even close.

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,093
Speaker 1: Smell.

69
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:55,720
Speaker 0: So, yeah, so like there's a lot of things I was thinking of that they could do to sort of fix this problem.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Speaker 2: But that's very easy to say.

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,339
Speaker 2: Oh, well, they could do this.

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,660
Speaker 2: I know that because if they had the resources to do something effective, it probably would have been done.

73
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,100
Speaker 0: I know that sort of it's sort of one of those things where, yes, they're obviously not going to do this because of, you know, realistic reasons like that.

74
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,880
Speaker 0: But it's fun to try to, you know, think of solutions to something like this from like, you know, an engineering sort of nerdy standpoint.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,020
Speaker 0: Like I was thinking, well, why did they even have train cars?

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:33,038
Speaker 0: Why don't they just have like, you know, like a big, long platform, you know, that that just moves around the tracks, like in a big circle, really slowly, constantly, you know, or something like that?

77
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:34,880
Speaker 1: Like at the airport?

78
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, sort of like at the airport.

79
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:52,660
Speaker 0: or maybe like you have one train, you know, if you didn't have a big metal train car, if you just had, you know, one engine and like, say, you know, just seats on boards, you know, just something like that was much more open and you could weigh a lot less.

80
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,300
Speaker 0: And that's one train engine could pull a lot more.

81
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,180
Speaker 0: You could be spread out a lot more.

82
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,318
Speaker 0: You know, maybe you could just I don't know.

83
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:04,760
Speaker 0: It seems like that might actually be pretty cheap to do, you know, if someone actually thought of it.

84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,322
Speaker 0: I mean, the safety concerns, if you fall off, you could get run over by the train, but it wouldn't be moving that fast.

85
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:25,362
Speaker 2: Well, I think the more fundamental problem is that if you look at the sort of governmental and civil infrastructure of nations like India, there's very little civic planning in most cases and a lot of corruption and such to the point that even if there was a good idea, I mean, how could you possibly implement it?

86
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:30,060
Speaker 2: The trains are the way they are, partly because no one is effectively tried to make a solution.

87
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:39,397
Speaker 1: And the huge population, I mean, we're talking about a rail system that ferries seven million commuters every day.

88
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,580
Speaker 0: No, that's like more than all the people in New York City.

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:43,902
Speaker 0: Right.

90
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,000
Speaker 0: How many people are in the city?

91
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:52,520
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is, we have a very extensive transit infrastructure in New York, but the population of New York grew a lot more slowly than the population in India.

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Speaker 2: There was a lot of time to adapt.

93
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:59,623
Speaker 2: And also we have we have superhighways in the car culture and there's all these alternate ways of getting around.

94
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,960
Speaker 0: I mean, there are cars in India, but you've seen that video.

95
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:03,918
Speaker 0: Good luck with that.

96
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:10,040
Speaker 1: Plus, you know, when you're making a couple dollars a day, you know, you're not going to be able to buy a car.

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,640
Speaker 2: I mean, a lot of Americans can't even afford to have cars or they have cars, but really they'd be better off if somehow they're away where they could just use some sort of public transit.

98
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,580
Speaker 2: I mean, the cost of ownership of a car in the U.S.

99
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,383
Speaker 2: is staggering.

100
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:28,037
Speaker 2: Our friend Conrad really he's desperate to find a way to just be able to get rid of his car and never own one again.

101
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:30,323
Speaker 0: Hmm.

102
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:33,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I take the train to work, but I still have to have the car.

103
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,100
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, or else I'd be screwed.

104
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,320
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be able to get groceries at the grocery store.

105
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,580
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be able to go to my parents' house.

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,364
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's.

107
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:43,659
Speaker 0: It's really not fair.

108
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:45,639
Speaker 1: Depends on where you live, too.

109
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,998
Speaker 0: I mean, if I lived in in the city or in one of the boroughs, you know, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, I wouldn't need a car.

110
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:58,440
Speaker 0: And it's actually difficult to have a car because I'd have to pay for somewhere to park it.

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,620
Speaker 2: But remember, I grew up in the Midwest where there there were barely even buses.

112
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,620
Speaker 2: I'd never seen a taxi in person until I got to New York.

113
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,300
Speaker 2: It's just it's a totally different world.

114
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,077
Speaker 2: There's no trains.

115
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:12,900
Speaker 1: And you wouldn't take a bus in Detroit anyway.

116
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,439
Speaker 0: I don't even take a bus in New York City, not because I'm like afraid of it or anything, but because I just don't trust.

117
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:27,039
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's more because we tend to restrict ourselves to Manhattan and occasionally the Bronx where there's no reason to ever take a bus.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,840
Speaker 0: The subways go everywhere except the Javits or they go close enough for you to walk.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,260
Speaker 2: But if you're going to the airport or you're in any other borough, the buses are actually great.

120
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:42,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess if I was you know, if I had to go somewhere and the bus was like the only going anywhere in Brooklyn that isn't near a subway, just take the bus.

121
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:43,559
Speaker 2: or if you live in Brooklyn.

122
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,440
Speaker 0: Like my cousins live in Queens and they could go to the subway, take the train.

123
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,520
Speaker 0: But they like the express bus is closer to their house and is, you know, faster.

124
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,740
Speaker 0: But it's a little bit more expensive.

125
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Speaker 0: I think it's like five dollars.

126
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,221
Speaker 2: Great.

127
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,239
Speaker 2: So obviously then the solution is we just need to build subways in India.

128
00:08:58,643 --> 00:08:59,719
Speaker 0: It's not a bad idea.

129
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,646
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.

130
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:01,779
Speaker 2: It's a terrible idea.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,559
Speaker 0: Well, you got to build enough of them.

132
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,261
Speaker 2: It's not.

133
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,800
Speaker 2: even subways aren't long distance or even medium distance transit.

134
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:10,393
Speaker 2: They can't go very far, at least by the way.

135
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,560
Speaker 2: we design modern subways.

136
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:20,080
Speaker 2: And considering that the part of the problem in India is that they don't have the money to build a more robust infrastructure, they're not going to build a depressurized underground super train.

137
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:31,800
Speaker 0: I guess they're not going to make a super train, but, you know, I don't know, they could build sort of like an amusement park thing where there's just a constant like this string of like, you know, little two seaters that just this third constant is two seat or two seat or two seat.

138
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,115
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know.

139
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,139
Speaker 1: You have population density like that.

140
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,660
Speaker 1: Human life has less value.

141
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:37,726
Speaker 1: They don't care.

142
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:38,814
Speaker 1: They don't care if 20,000 people die.

143
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,839
Speaker 1: They're not going to change anything.

144
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,879
Speaker 1: They're pouring as much money as they can into it now.

145
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,620
Speaker 1: But it's not enough to keep up with the pace of population growth.

146
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:57,140
Speaker 2: I mean, I think there's also the point of even if individual people care in the system, the system itself, I mean, you know, a bureaucracy gets to the point where it maintains itself.

147
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,319
Speaker 2: And the system takes a lot more work to make it care than any individual person working within it.

148
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:05,460
Speaker 0: It's depressing.

149
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,417
Speaker 0: And, you know, I think the train like on Thanksgiving, sometimes our train will be filled up to the point where, you know, people are standing in the aisles.

150
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,560
Speaker 0: But that's not crowded at all compared to this.

151
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:21,106
Speaker 2: Of course, you look at a lot of people on that train and to them, it's the end of the goddamn world.

152
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

153
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,619
Speaker 0: Imagine I should take I should print out pictures of the India train and like tape them to the walls on the New York train.

154
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:34,602
Speaker 2: I mean, actually, today my train was delayed by about five minutes because there was rain and all this.

155
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,800
Speaker 0: Well, they're doing something to one of the tracks up near Beacon.

156
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:37,999
Speaker 0: I was I was delayed also.

157
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,039
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was also because of the rain which delayed the work with blah, blah, blah.

158
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,459
Speaker 2: But we were delayed like five minutes.

159
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:50,500
Speaker 2: And when the conductor announces like, I apologize for the delay, we're going kind of slowly due to rain and construction, we'll be arriving about five minutes late.

160
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,319
Speaker 2: And this guy sitting a little ways down goes, Son of a goddamn it.

161
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Speaker 2: My tax dollars, Metro North, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

162
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,948
Speaker 2: This is bullshit.

163
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:00,000
Speaker 2: This is worse than Amtrak.

164
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,120
Speaker 2: And he's just going on and on and on to himself.

165
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:09,805
Speaker 2: And all I could think was, dude, not only is Metro North not paid for by your tax dollars and profitable.

166
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

167
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:21,740
Speaker 2: I mean, Amtrak, you can complain about if you're, say, you know, out in the middle of nowhere where it sucks, but you mean out in the middle of nowhere where they shouldn't be using trains, where buses and hubs would be much more efficient?

168
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,526
Speaker 0: Exactly.

169
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

170
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:31,552
Speaker 2: Yeah.

171
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:36,010
Speaker 2: So things of the day, I'll admit this is quite a cop out.

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,628
Speaker 2: This is one of those backup things today.

173
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,328
Speaker 2: I kind of keep around for when I didn't see anything worthwhile on the Internet.

174
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:42,830
Speaker 2: that wasn't already on CollegeHumor.

175
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,469
Speaker 2: I'm not going to tell you how I found this.

176
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:55,428
Speaker 2: It I will not admit that I was just sitting around looking up pictures upon videos, upon movies, upon everything I could find of puppies and baby foxes.

177
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:56,826
Speaker 0: And that's your default.

178
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,970
Speaker 0: Find the cute animals.

179
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,551
Speaker 2: Yes.

180
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,850
Speaker 2: But this one, Shiba Inu are incredible dogs.

181
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,090
Speaker 2: They're incredibly, amazingly intelligent.

182
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:12,030
Speaker 2: But as a result, they're really whiny and they're very talkative and they're very difficult for a lot of people to deal with because they're smart and they're obstinate.

183
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:19,791
Speaker 2: And well, this Shiba Inu has encountered an intruder in his space and the way he reacts to it.

184
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:23,908
Speaker 2: And of course, more so than that, the nature of the intruder is kind of epic.

185
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,250
Speaker 2: I don't think I'll even let on to what the intruder is.

186
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,341
Speaker 2: I think you should watch the video to get the kind of.

187
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:35,930
Speaker 0: I'm feeling like I might want to spoil your secret, because every time I try to lead people into something and secret it up, you spoil it.

188
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,930
Speaker 2: When was the last time I did that yesterday?

189
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:47,729
Speaker 2: See, I have words about the way you were trying to review that show that for a Wednesday when I try to do a show on how to review a show.

190
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

191
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,649
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that's going to be a good show.

192
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:51,573
Speaker 0: All right.

193
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:53,650
Speaker 0: I'll do my thing today and then then you can go, Thade.

194
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,551
Speaker 0: All right.

195
00:12:54,591 --> 00:13:07,649
Speaker 0: So my company, you know, last year we did some softball and it didn't go so well because you sort of like all this, all the sort of company sports leagues in the city, they require you to have like, you know, X players show up or else you lose.

196
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,670
Speaker 0: And they require you to have like, you know, a mix of male and female players.

197
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,090
Speaker 0: And that's that's all well and good.

198
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,630
Speaker 0: Those are good rules that they have there.

199
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,550
Speaker 0: But my company had very, very few people total.

200
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:24,810
Speaker 0: So it was very difficult to get a whole softball team together, you know, on this, you know, the times and the schedules for the games.

201
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:28,550
Speaker 0: And a lot of the games will be far away from our office, like way uptown.

202
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,950
Speaker 0: And no one wanted to go, you know, so it didn't last very long.

203
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:40,070
Speaker 0: But actually, we were looking around, you know, because some of us in the office still kind of want to do some sort of office sport of some kind.

204
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:46,090
Speaker 0: And we found this really cool website, Zog Sports dot com, Zog Sports dot com.

205
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,800
Speaker 0: And check this out.

206
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,408
Speaker 0: This is way cool.

207
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,012
Speaker 0: You they have basically, you know, sports leagues for, you know, amateur nonprofessional teams.

208
00:13:54,654 --> 00:14:02,982
Speaker 0: They let you play, you know, either like ultra casual, casual or, you know, kind of weak, actually caring about winning and losing, you know, playing.

209
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:07,250
Speaker 0: all the money that, you know, you give to them to sort of join the leagues.

210
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:07,812
Speaker 0: Right.

211
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:16,110
Speaker 0: They use that to, you know, rent the fields and the equipment and all that stuff and pay the umpires or whatever sort of officials they need to to referee the games.

212
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,150
Speaker 0: But the rest of the money all goes to charities and such.

213
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:20,483
Speaker 0: And when you win.

214
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:20,604
Speaker 0: Right.

215
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,390
Speaker 0: If your team wins, the prize you get is a cash prize to the charity of your choice.

216
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,510
Speaker 0: So winning is sort of like you get to pick the charity.

217
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:34,696
Speaker 0: And the best part about this whole thing is that it's not just sort of your normal sports, even though it is.

218
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:35,930
Speaker 2: They have volleyball in there.

219
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,230
Speaker 0: Well, let me let me list some of the sports here.

220
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,544
Speaker 0: We got touch footballs.

221
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,029
Speaker 0: We got kickball.

222
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:50,870
Speaker 0: We got wiffle ball and the rest are, you know, indoor soccer, outdoor soccer, volleyball, basketball, kickball.

223
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,678
Speaker 0: I said kickball.

224
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,650
Speaker 0: Oh, and dodgeball.

225
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:53,297
Speaker 0: That's right.

226
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:54,330
Speaker 0: Oh, and coming.

227
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:54,834
Speaker 2: Wait a minute.

228
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:55,281
Speaker 2: Wait a minute.

229
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:55,830
Speaker 2: Dodgeball.

230
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,910
Speaker 2: There's a lot of ways to play.

231
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:02,410
Speaker 0: Coming soon, whitewater rafting, surfing and beach trip and wine tasting.

232
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,611
Speaker 0: How about that?

233
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:06,899
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's good stuff.

234
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,680
Speaker 1: Sounds like the Cleveland Sport and Social Club we had here a few years ago.

235
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm always wanting to do something like that, but it's not easy to get it together unless you you know, you live down there, because I mean, if I stay after work for like a kickball game.

236
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,329
Speaker 1: It's covered.

237
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,420
Speaker 1: You'd meet girls.

238
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

239
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:33,879
Speaker 0: Maybe they said that, like, you know, after games, they like they pay for you to like go out and drink or whatever.

240
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,225
Speaker 1: Well, there you go.

241
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:37,800
Speaker 1: They could have some orange juice for you or something.

242
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure.

243
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,520
Speaker 0: All right.

244
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,239
Speaker 0: You have a thing of the day?

245
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,538
Speaker 1: Yes, my thing of the day is Muto, a wall painted animation by Blue.

246
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 1: And this is a short film by this guy named Blue who did it in Buenos Aires.

247
00:15:53,442 --> 00:16:05,660
Speaker 1: What he did, which must have taken I can't even imagine how much paint and how much time this took, but he did an animation like you would on paper on a wall with graffiti.

248
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,680
Speaker 1: So he did this whole movie of this, this, this animation and this wall going inside, outside, down the street, into holes, all of these things.

249
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,120
Speaker 1: At times it gets to be two or three stories tall.

250
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:25,240
Speaker 1: The amount of labor that went into this is just, I mean, it must have taken months.

251
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,679
Speaker 0: Are you sure it wasn't like digitally aided?

252
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:31,100
Speaker 1: No, no, this is, this is, this is Buenos Aires.

253
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,660
Speaker 1: I mean, this is, this is Latin America.

254
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:34,620
Speaker 1: This is old school.

255
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,300
Speaker 1: This is, you know, a camera and a guy with a lot of paint and a lot of time.

256
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:53,939
Speaker 1: But, you know, the style of animation, I mean, you've seen, I guess I'd describe it as the human form going through various mutations, you know, people climbing out of their own skin and shapes for heads.

257
00:16:54,841 --> 00:17:05,460
Speaker 1: And I mean, the animation, I think we've all seen it before, but just the fact that it's done as graffiti and it's, and it's animated, I mean, the, the effort is, is stunning.

258
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:11,457
Speaker 0: I was, I started to watch the video, but then I stopped and I haven't seen it, so I don't really know.

259
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:20,280
Speaker 0: But, you know, I mean, it is posted on the internet, so there's obviously some, you know, don't like think, oh, it's somewhere that's, you know, I don't think about.

260
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,016
Speaker 0: They don't have any technology because they do.

261
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,300
Speaker 0: All right, so basically what I'm going to go for here is, is I'm going to, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions.

262
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,920
Speaker 0: You don't have to answer all of them if you don't want to, but I hope that this will take us somewhere interesting.

263
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,200
Speaker 0: And this is sort of the experiment for the future.

264
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,680
Speaker 2: Yeah, everyone out there for good or ill, this episode is mostly Scott, if you can't tell.

265
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,259
Speaker 2: I'm kind of just chilling back.

266
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

267
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:53,576
Speaker 0: And so I want all listeners out there who are who are listening to this show to make comments on it, you know, because we're going to sort of try to continue this.

268
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:55,778
Speaker 0: maybe or maybe not if you all hate it.

269
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,140
Speaker 2: But hopefully it'll be good as long as you keep the energy up.

270
00:17:59,385 --> 00:17:59,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

271
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,018
Speaker 0: I'm trying to keep the energy up.

272
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:01,900
Speaker 0: All right.

273
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,299
Speaker 0: So the first question I'm going to ask you, right.

274
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,500
Speaker 0: So you are a Geek Nights listener.

275
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:07,299
Speaker 0: Yes, obviously.

276
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:08,979
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, I am.

277
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,920
Speaker 0: How did you find Geek Nights?

278
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:12,398
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

279
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:13,499
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

280
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:14,639
Speaker 1: It's been a while.

281
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:26,840
Speaker 1: I was looking for a good podcast to listen to, and I was just going through, I probably did some searches, some indexes on technology related things.

282
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,698
Speaker 1: And I don't know, I think that I just I would listen to a couple of shows and just weed them out.

283
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:37,880
Speaker 1: And if the sound quality was bad, that I that just kills me immediately.

284
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,559
Speaker 1: So you guys have always had good sound.

285
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,660
Speaker 2: Well, well, you never heard the special episodes.

286
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,460
Speaker 1: The ones that you won't tell people about on the forums.

287
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,298
Speaker 1: They're out there.

288
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,539
Speaker 0: I mean, even even the non, you know, the early episodes that weren't special, if you listen to those, they're really terrible compared to like what we're doing right now.

289
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:59,980
Speaker 1: I mean, I was listening to Adam Curry when I first started listening to podcasts.

290
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:01,780
Speaker 0: I did, too, and I don't anymore.

291
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,039
Speaker 1: No, no, he's still doing it.

292
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,040
Speaker 1: But I didn't know that or whatever.

293
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,000
Speaker 1: I it's not.

294
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:16,239
Speaker 1: But once you get you find shows that that cater to your interests, then, you know, you gravitate toward those.

295
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,479
Speaker 1: And then I was interested enough to start doing podcasting.

296
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,354
Speaker 1: And I think it was about the same time that I started.

297
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,737
Speaker 1: Friday Night Partyline is when I started listening to your show.

298
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,538
Speaker 0: So so why do you like our show?

299
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,705
Speaker 1: Well, I think that it's.

300
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,080
Speaker 1: you know, you guys obviously have a terrific sense of comic timing and you you work very well together.

301
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:47,700
Speaker 1: But for me, it's probably the fact that you don't hold back.

302
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,619
Speaker 1: You don't try to dumb it down.

303
00:19:50,521 --> 00:20:00,780
Speaker 1: My whole life, I have searched for people and through things that that aren't dumbed down because our society and our culture is geared toward the sixth grade reading level.

304
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,640
Speaker 1: And and, you know, RIM is always people are always busting his traps about being elitist.

305
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,879
Speaker 1: And my thought is, come on, you know, step up.

306
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,020
Speaker 2: Jeez, it works for Barack Obama.

307
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,783
Speaker 2: It'll work for me.

308
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:14,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,751
Speaker 1: I agree with you on so many things from except for for Mr.

310
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:21,620
Speaker 2: Obama, but we'll have to have a little post show discussion.

311
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,263
Speaker 2: I'm curious.

312
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,442
Speaker 0: I wanted to start a lot of discussions, but I don't know if I want to start that one.

313
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:31,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate talking about politics on the Internet and on Twitter and all these people talking about their political views.

314
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:40,503
Speaker 2: And I don't know, I think I'd like talking about politics with you on the show, especially because Scott will never, ever talk about politics and doesn't know anything and doesn't care.

315
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,500
Speaker 0: So, you know, I care a little.

316
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,840
Speaker 0: I just don't care that much.

317
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:50,659
Speaker 0: And it's mostly, you know, over, you know, for the earlier part of my life, I didn't know, you know, right from left.

318
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:56,202
Speaker 0: And then once I knew, you know, just discussing it was like, you know, at one point it was interesting.

319
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:59,680
Speaker 0: But then lately it's just frustrating because everybody's crazy.

320
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:15,020
Speaker 0: I just before we go out and everyone argues from emotion and everyone argues irrationally, everyone and most people, though, at least especially on the Internet, it's like it's very difficult to actually get a real political discussion focusing on, you know, because I always come at things you try.

321
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,507
Speaker 0: I try to from like a political science standpoint, and most people sort of don't see that view.

322
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:21,820
Speaker 0: And it's very difficult.

323
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,019
Speaker 0: All right, anyway, so.

324
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,340
Speaker 0: You've heard, you know, we've done like a bajillion Geek Nights episodes, right?

325
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:37,336
Speaker 0: Do you have an idea for for a Geek Nights show topic that we haven't done that you would very much like?

326
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,760
Speaker 1: Oh, Monday, Mondays and Thursdays are my favorite days.

327
00:21:42,120 --> 00:22:10,439
Speaker 1: So if you just take the technology stuff that you know and then really don't hold back, if you're something that you're interested in professionally, where you like in your coding, you were saying you were complaining the other day about not being able to parse something, if you if you could take something that that you see in your day or some philosophical aspect of of of computer programming and then really go into it in detail, pretending like we're all at your level.

328
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:17,820
Speaker 1: And then that way, as listeners, we can work to understand what you're saying as opposed to just saying, oh, I can't get my brain around that.

329
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,446
Speaker 1: I forget it.

330
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:19,460
Speaker 1: I'm not going to listen anymore.

331
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,560
Speaker 1: That's kind of what I appreciate.

332
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,700
Speaker 1: But that probably puts me in the minority of listeners.

333
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you wouldn't believe the amount of feedback we got when we way back tried to do this whole how computers work thing.

334
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:35,120
Speaker 2: And we started, I think, with like flip flops and like the basics of electronics.

335
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,980
Speaker 0: And I'm going to have to redo this video now, I think.

336
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,160
Speaker 2: Yeah.

337
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,545
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is pretty.

338
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:44,957
Speaker 2: the emails we got were basically, wow, I'm stupid and I want it from a first grade level.

339
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:49,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we also got emails saying, wow, that was really great.

340
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:50,720
Speaker 0: And it's so half and half.

341
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,798
Speaker 0: We don't know which way to go.

342
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:59,042
Speaker 0: And with those shows, our goal is sort of to actually help people understand how computers work.

343
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:03,658
Speaker 0: So it's if they're not going to understand it, then it's sort of like we're not achieving our goal.

344
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:12,865
Speaker 0: You know, but on the other hand, we sort of you know, if people if we're saying things that are so dumb that no one's learning anything new, then it's also sort of not achieving our goal.

345
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,080
Speaker 2: Well, it's tricky with particularly what I do.

346
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:25,580
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm kind of apart from Scott and a lot of the other people we know technology wise and that everything I do is like enterprise level, like it's this totally different realm of computers and technology.

347
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:35,115
Speaker 2: And it's it's something that has zero application in 90 percent of technology professionals lives and ninety nine percent of human beings lives like.

348
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:48,300
Speaker 2: the topics are so esoteric and so specific and so just utterly, utterly I don't I mean, not necessarily difficult or beyond, but just not applicable in any way to people's lives.

349
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,301
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

350
00:23:50,904 --> 00:24:05,940
Speaker 1: And a big call for Emily to be in the show more, I think that if you can interject someone else who is dynamic and and smart and of course female, then people are going to like most of your audience is male.

351
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:13,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have a lot of, you know, other front row crew people, but, you know, they're not always nearby or they're not always willing.

352
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,900
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, on New Year's, I tried to get one of our friends on the show because he's like an expert on many technological issues, even more so than than we are.

353
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,400
Speaker 0: But he was like talking about James.

354
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he didn't want to.

355
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,477
Speaker 0: He was like, no, I don't want to.

356
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:31,239
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, because I kind of wanted to hear what he had to say, because he, you know, he knows a lot more than I do.

357
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:35,218
Speaker 1: Not everybody is an attention whore like we are.

358
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,460
Speaker 0: No, I guess not.

359
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,458
Speaker 2: Yeah, we started young at that, though.

360
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:42,642
Speaker 0: All right.

361
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:51,040
Speaker 0: So what other like podcasts or video internet shows do you listen to or watch frequently?

362
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:52,563
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

363
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:55,680
Speaker 1: I could give you a more complete list if I had my eye.

364
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,540
Speaker 2: You don't have to be complete, just, you know, actually, it's probably better this way because instead of going through the list, it's kind of what was on your mind.

365
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:08,360
Speaker 2: I mean, there's shows I nominally listen to and I'm subscribed to, but I don't think about them on a daily basis because I don't like them that much, to be honest.

366
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,980
Speaker 1: I've really tried to go out and look for some more recently.

367
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,954
Speaker 1: You know, since we worked with Dr.

368
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,839
Speaker 1: Kiki, I pretty much have followed everything that she's doing from This Week in Media to This Week in Science.

369
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,719
Speaker 1: There's all of the Leo Laporte podcasts are pretty good.

370
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mostly only listen to Twit and the Floss Weekly.

371
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,818
Speaker 0: The Floss Weekly, that's the best one, I have to say.

372
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,880
Speaker 1: Net at Night, I think it's called with Amber McArthur.

373
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,577
Speaker 1: That's really Amber McArthur is very pleasant to listen to.

374
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:47,939
Speaker 1: And the CNET podcast, Buzz Out Loud.

375
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:49,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard of that.

376
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Speaker 1: That's very good.

377
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,158
Speaker 1: I mean, Molly Wood is one of those unique personalities, very fun to listen to.

378
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:06,079
Speaker 1: Of course, Extra Life Radio, Scott Johnson, who we may or may not have a connection with here in the short future.

379
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got too many Scott Johnsons.

380
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:10,859
Speaker 0: We got to find a way to separate them.

381
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:14,180
Speaker 2: Yeah, our Scott Johnson is the one who actually knows about politics.

382
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:15,818
Speaker 2: And I actually get to talk to him.

383
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:18,940
Speaker 0: Well, we don't know that the other Scott Johnson doesn't know about politics.

384
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,199
Speaker 2: He's in our crew.

385
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,272
Speaker 2: Yeah, he understands politics enough to where?

386
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:31,420
Speaker 2: if you make a political science argument, he understands it and responds with an equally valid political science argument as opposed to a but McCain.

387
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,639
Speaker 0: But it will be expressed with not much eloquence.

388
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:37,400
Speaker 0: Hey, it's true.

389
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:38,048
Speaker 0: He knows it.

390
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,738
Speaker 0: He doesn't care.

391
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,074
Speaker 0: All right.

392
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:43,259
Speaker 1: There's a couple others.

393
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:51,800
Speaker 1: Maximum PC, just because it's it's hard to find a really good hardware show.

394
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:54,919
Speaker 1: There's Maximum PC is good.

395
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,172
Speaker 1: And there's another one.

396
00:26:57,845 --> 00:26:59,019
Speaker 1: I can't think of the name of it.

397
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,280
Speaker 1: It's Extreme Tech.

398
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,100
Speaker 1: That's an Extreme Tech podcast, both hardware related shows.

399
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,480
Speaker 1: And that's really as far as computer knowledge goes.

400
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,719
Speaker 1: That's my strong point.

401
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,740
Speaker 1: It's from a hobbyist perspective anyway.

402
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,840
Speaker 2: I'll actually admit that I used to be that way.

403
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,119
Speaker 2: And then in recent years, like I'm so divorced from the PC world that I don't even I wouldn't know what video card to buy.

404
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,060
Speaker 2: I don't I have to look up to figure out what processor goes with what motherboard or which one's fast or what Northbridge is good anymore.

405
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,640
Speaker 0: It took me a long time to build that computer, much longer than it would have in the past.

406
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,265
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

407
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,659
Speaker 1: It all comes back to you, though.

408
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:30,643
Speaker 0: It does.

409
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:35,099
Speaker 0: But it's sort of like you have to relearn like what acronyms match up with what others and all that business.

410
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:37,660
Speaker 1: Someone in your forum suggested Geeks On.

411
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,160
Speaker 1: I went back and I listened to the Joss Whedon episode that they had.

412
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,200
Speaker 1: That was outstanding.

413
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,060
Speaker 1: But I started listening to their latest show and they got a couple of things wrong.

414
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,560
Speaker 1: And that just it's almost like bad sound to me.

415
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,741
Speaker 1: If you if you don't know what you're talking about, then you shouldn't be talking about it.

416
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,225
Speaker 2: They were using the word schadenfreude.

417
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,440
Speaker 1: And I may have even mispronounced it, but but I know that it's German and not French.

418
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:07,352
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

419
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:07,959
Speaker 2: Wow.

420
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,420
Speaker 0: OK, because I was going to say, like, you know, we get things wrong.

421
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,760
Speaker 0: Sometimes we even know we get them wrong.

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,506
Speaker 0: But we do a good job of I think at least I think we do a good job of pretending we know what we're talking about.

423
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,640
Speaker 0: And it's convincing that we're not bullshitting.

424
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:36,157
Speaker 2: That's a problem I have when I when I sell things to people or I do my stuff and I tend to it's very easy to talk around anything I don't know and make it appear that I know a lot more than I may actually know.

425
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,959
Speaker 1: Well, and I'm not being fair at all.

426
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,160
Speaker 1: But, you know, if you do get it wrong, everybody makes mistakes.

427
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:45,260
Speaker 1: Then correct yourself.

428
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,618
Speaker 1: Don't try to hide it.

429
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,662
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, if people call us if people call me out and I'm wrong, I always say I'm wrong.

430
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:59,700
Speaker 0: You know, I just you know, but it's surprising how many episodes, like, especially when we used to sort of do like reading Wikipedia episodes.

431
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:01,171
Speaker 0: Oh, no one.

432
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:02,260
Speaker 0: No one would call us out.

433
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,720
Speaker 2: I remember there was one word way back where you're talking about programming.

434
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:13,820
Speaker 2: And for like five minutes straight, you were talking about like object oriented and all these different kinds of programming and you just set them all backwards.

435
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,620
Speaker 2: But no one noticed to this day.

436
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:16,288
Speaker 2: I don't think.

437
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:16,836
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

438
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,159
Speaker 2: Because we noticed it after the fact.

439
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,759
Speaker 2: We're like, oh, man, we totally screwed that up.

440
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,559
Speaker 2: But to this day, no one ever called us out on it.

441
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,919
Speaker 2: And a lot of people listen to that episode.

442
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:30,160
Speaker 1: I think podcasting is going through kind of a phase change right now.

443
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,640
Speaker 1: People are trying to do innovative things.

444
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:44,137
Speaker 1: If you look at Leo Laporte, he's doing twenty five hours of video now, he's trying to bring the world to Leo so he can stay in his area and then just not have to travel at all and people have to travel to him.

445
00:29:45,761 --> 00:30:01,480
Speaker 1: I, Justine from Pittsburgh and Alex Lindsay from This Week in Media, we're just out there and it's kind of interesting to watch him sort of go into video because the way he describes it, it doesn't seem to be like he has a real plan.

446
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,139
Speaker 1: And for me, I don't consume much video.

447
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,040
Speaker 1: I mean, very, very little because there's no time.

448
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:15,919
Speaker 1: I'm too busy doing the things that I do in my life, whereas with audio, I can listen to it in the car while I'm doing other things.

449
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:30,060
Speaker 1: So in terms of my own podcasting stuff, I'm going to continue to explore audio, but I'm only going to do video as sort of special things for work and maybe some computer stuff.

450
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:33,860
Speaker 2: That's definitely the direction we're going in with the whole video thing.

451
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:53,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, it definitely seems, though, like his video is pretty much just showing the people's faces while they're recording the otherwise audio show, you know, to sort of just add the, you know, you can see the person's face, you know, element and maybe also, you know, if they're talking about a particular device or something, they can actually show it to you.

452
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,560
Speaker 0: But it seems like that's all he's really doing with the video.

453
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,320
Speaker 0: Is he doing more that I don't know about?

454
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:08,900
Speaker 1: Oh, and I mean, if he's looking to try to turn this into a company, he can sell like, you know, CBS buying CNET for one point seven, five billion or however much they bought it for today.

455
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:14,699
Speaker 1: I think that someone like Kevin Rose is going to have a much better chance with revision three than he is with this.

456
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,440
Speaker 1: I just don't know what you know.

457
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,960
Speaker 1: How do you get advertisers for a thousand people that have nothing better to do but watch you do a podcast?

458
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:25,926
Speaker 1: I don't get.

459
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,860
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't understand where the model is.

460
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:28,454
Speaker 1: I don't know.

461
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:33,140
Speaker 2: At least we've avoided that whole pitfall by just not trying to make money at all.

462
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,420
Speaker 0: Well, we're not trying to make money with the Geek Nights show.

463
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:52,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what I mean, we've already I'm starting to find ways, you know, because I always said the Geek Night show is sort of like, you know, let's get out there and then we can do other things and then we'll have sort of like an installed audience for other things that may or may not make money, you know.

464
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,959
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like if I would have done a project before, like let's say I would have made something like a game.

465
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:01,622
Speaker 0: You know, if I would have tried to sell that game, you know, it would be very difficult.

466
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:11,919
Speaker 0: But now it's sort of like I have this this base and it's like if I do anything else, this base, I can easily draw their attention to it and sort of get off with like a little head start at anything I do.

467
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,139
Speaker 0: So that's that's sort of what Geek Nights is for.

468
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,363
Speaker 2: All right.

469
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:21,378
Speaker 2: Yeah, for me, though, it's just to keep my audience, I'll go crazy if I don't have a lot of people listening to my voice every day.

470
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, that, too.

471
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,759
Speaker 1: Attention whore, yes.

472
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:29,258
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm as guilty as you are, I love it as much as you do.

473
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:45,799
Speaker 2: Even we got in some of the other front row crew people as they brush with Geek Nights, they do stuff with us where there's crowds or there's fans or anything, and they always come back and they kind of say they usually say something along the lines of, wow, it's kind of cool being on the other side of that velvet rope.

474
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,340
Speaker 0: I know you're going to say a velvet rope.

475
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,039
Speaker 2: Can I can I be behind that velvet rope again?

476
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,820
Speaker 0: It'll be like you can be behind as many velvet ropes as you want.

477
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,347
Speaker 0: All right.

478
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:56,849
Speaker 0: So you are.

479
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:59,914
Speaker 0: you are quite a geeky person, obviously, if you're if you're liking the geek nights.

480
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:00,199
Speaker 0: Right.

481
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:01,042
Speaker 0: Yeah.

482
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,208
Speaker 0: So so what are your?

483
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,439
Speaker 0: what are your primary geekeries?

484
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,520
Speaker 0: Because, you know, we we're sort of got our hands on all the geekeries.

485
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:08,622
Speaker 1: Right.

486
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:12,740
Speaker 1: Oh, and you've you've opened my eyes to other things, geek related.

487
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,260
Speaker 1: I was only kind of into anime and I'm still nothing like you guys or some of the listeners.

488
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:22,337
Speaker 0: We're not even that much into anime as we used to be.

489
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,127
Speaker 1: Or what's?

490
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:24,994
Speaker 1: what's her name, Tenshi.

491
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:27,320
Speaker 2: Oh, and Neforum.

492
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's her own show, too.

493
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,919
Speaker 1: She's really, really into the animes.

494
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:36,559
Speaker 1: But no, computer hardware is my primary geek area.

495
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:49,100
Speaker 1: If I shared with you some of the computer things that I've got going on here in my home office that we've nicknamed Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Mission Control.

496
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:51,419
Speaker 1: I have about 15 computers.

497
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,100
Speaker 1: I Mac is the only non PC related.

498
00:33:57,121 --> 00:34:03,440
Speaker 1: I have a Ubuntu box and the rest of the stuff is Win 2K, XP and Vista.

499
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:17,399
Speaker 1: But, you know, I just I'm playing with computers all the time, whether it's swapping out hard drives out of laptops or building machines from scratch or for other people, I just it's something that relaxes me.

500
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,380
Speaker 1: I have a pretty stressful job and it's that's that's, you know, it's really.

501
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,982
Speaker 0: Nancy, I was way into, you know, fiddling with the computers themselves for for a long time.

502
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:31,856
Speaker 0: And early on, it was like a big, you know, learning thing like.

503
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:36,360
Speaker 0: that's how I learned a lot of the stuff I know is just by putting computers together, installing operating systems.

504
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:39,780
Speaker 2: I mean, you used to run Jentu and unlike me, you actually kept part of job today.

505
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:40,464
Speaker 0: Yeah.

506
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:42,320
Speaker 0: And that helped me learn a lot.

507
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,440
Speaker 0: But then I sort of reached a point where I wasn't learning anymore.

508
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:51,480
Speaker 0: And it was just, you know, it's I wanted to use the computer to do things I didn't want to.

509
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,684
Speaker 0: You know, I found that I was spending all my time working for the computer and the computer wasn't working for me.

510
00:34:56,744 --> 00:35:04,320
Speaker 0: So that's why now it's just like install Ubuntu or install whatever the default OS is, use the default settings and just get work done.

511
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,823
Speaker 0: You know, so.

512
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,040
Speaker 2: But you got to got to tweak your kernel.

513
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,359
Speaker 2: The kernel's got to be tweaked.

514
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,103
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

515
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,060
Speaker 1: And that's more software than hardware.

516
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,720
Speaker 1: You know, I just built a couple of FreeNAS servers and that that has been a lot of fun.

517
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,579
Speaker 1: FreeNAS is a lot of fun to play with.

518
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,180
Speaker 1: And, you know, one of them's a four terabyte server.

519
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,479
Speaker 1: And I did a. I did a video about that.

520
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:45,244
Speaker 1: And the funny thing as far as video killing podcasting, I think I have over 2,000 views on that video, whereas the average, you know, number of listeners for, say, the over 40 gamer podcasts that I was doing for a while, you know, I was getting 70 or 80 a month on that solo show.

521
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,639
Speaker 1: So video is much more powerful.

522
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,104
Speaker 1: No, it isn't.

523
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:53,961
Speaker 1: And Friday Night Party Line's numbers are considerably, well, substantially higher.

524
00:35:53,982 --> 00:36:02,000
Speaker 2: I mean, I think the issue is with video, like the main thing we want to do with video is it seems like a lot of people just don't understand podcasting.

525
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:11,945
Speaker 2: Even to this day, the vast majority of people I talk to have never heard of the word of no idea what it is that they and even if they own an iPod, they just like, oh, I don't know, is that some iTunes thing?

526
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:15,285
Speaker 0: It's like a podcasting button in iTunes, but they don't notice it somehow.

527
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:16,380
Speaker 2: They don't even know it's there.

528
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,659
Speaker 2: Never, never even cross their mind to click on it.

529
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:23,060
Speaker 2: So we want to make videos that kind of point out, hey, there's podcast.

530
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:24,959
Speaker 0: We should definitely do a how-to podcast video.

531
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,839
Speaker 2: You all commute.

532
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,338
Speaker 1: Kevin Rose did one three years ago.

533
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,000
Speaker 1: I mean, that helped me get into this show and get into this stuff.

534
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:38,980
Speaker 1: I mean, the folks over at Revision3 have done a lot of the things that you're talking about and they're making a go of it.

535
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,411
Speaker 1: But I have a feeling that their numbers on some of their shows are probably lower than Geek Nights.

536
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,404
Speaker 0: Well, some of it, yeah.

537
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:55,122
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, some of the Revision3 shows, I mean, I know who Revision3 is just from listening, you know, to to Twit and formerly reading Dig and all that stuff.

538
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:58,320
Speaker 0: But, you know, I only know about some of their biggest shows.

539
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,351
Speaker 0: I mean, they have a lot of shows on there and most of them, I think most people just never heard of them.

540
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:07,452
Speaker 1: If you can't tie advertising to it, though, it's it's it's not.

541
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:13,340
Speaker 1: it's hard to sustain with the degree of quality that you'll need to compete with other things that are happening.

542
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:19,122
Speaker 1: There are so many people that do podcasting and maybe do one or two shows and then then fade away.

543
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:25,320
Speaker 1: But the number of good, consistent podcasts, I think, is actually shrinking.

544
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,059
Speaker 2: I would have to agree.

545
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,719
Speaker 2: I mean, I have an added new podcast to my repertoire and in a long time and I have it's not like I've stopped looking.

546
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:40,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, sort of what I've had is I sort of found enough podcasts to sort of fill my daily routine.

547
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:46,100
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, I added recently that the John C. Dvorak's like Tech Five, you know, it's very short.

548
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,386
Speaker 0: So I can just sort of listen to it in the morning really quickly, like I'm driving to the train station.

549
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:51,378
Speaker 0: I can listen to the whole thing.

550
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,399
Speaker 1: Well, that's what Grammar Girl does, too.

551
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:06,400
Speaker 1: And Grammar Girl has that whole company of all, you know, legal lad and sales guy and all of these six minute podcasts that that have advertising in it, but give you a nugget of value in that six minutes.

552
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,600
Speaker 0: Onion Radio News, I think, was the first podcast to really master that format.

553
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:13,433
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

554
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:14,060
Speaker 0: All right.

555
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,660
Speaker 0: So you said you're like primary geekery is like computer hardware, right?

556
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
Speaker 0: But you weren't like born with a CPU hanging out of your mouth or anything.

557
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,538
Speaker 0: So how did you like get into that?

558
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,460
Speaker 1: Well, it just goes back to the beginning.

559
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,204
Speaker 1: I'm old.

560
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:29,179
Speaker 1: I'm two years old.

561
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:32,597
Speaker 1: And, you know, so I mean, I played with Trash 80s.

562
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,683
Speaker 1: I played with.

563
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:36,380
Speaker 1: I had a Timex Sinclair computer.

564
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,140
Speaker 1: I played with them since they became popular.

565
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,059
Speaker 1: I still have my original IBM XT.

566
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,700
Speaker 0: XTs are good for typing.

567
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,360
Speaker 1: When you when you just play with something as a hobby for more than 20 years, you just learn really.

568
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,340
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, I'm a lawyer.

569
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,339
Speaker 1: I'm not I'm not a computer guy.

570
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:55,701
Speaker 0: Yeah.

571
00:38:55,721 --> 00:39:01,779
Speaker 0: I was just about to say, like, you know, with such an interesting computers, you ended up, though, as the lawyer, like how did did you did you?

572
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's a fair question.

573
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,860
Speaker 0: I you know, I mean, would you rather be a computer guy?

574
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:12,829
Speaker 1: Oh, that's such that's I don't know.

575
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:19,749
Speaker 1: I think that I'd rather do what you would rather do and be sort of independently wealthy and then do whatever it's like that day.

576
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,790
Speaker 0: Well, you have enough money to feed both of us.

577
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,597
Speaker 0: So let's both quit.

578
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:23,970
Speaker 0: And we'll get on that.

579
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,075
Speaker 2: Well, there was that period about a year ago when I was thinking about just giving up on I.T.

580
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:28,825
Speaker 2: going to law school.

581
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:30,277
Speaker 0: It's true.

582
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,350
Speaker 2: Going the opposite direction.

583
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,890
Speaker 2: Luckily, but I mean, that was all before.

584
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,887
Speaker 2: I guess I was so disillusioned with I.T.

585
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,970
Speaker 2: just because I had a pretty crappy job and I was making, you know, mediocre money.

586
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,670
Speaker 2: And then suddenly now stock market gigantic.

587
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,690
Speaker 2: Like I actually just got a fifteen thousand dollar raise out of the blue last week.

588
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,469
Speaker 2: Like my boss said, hey, you want fifteen thousand more dollars?

589
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:55,110
Speaker 2: And I was like, yeah, I think I'm going to stick around this place a while.

590
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,249
Speaker 2: So I think I've given up on my lawyer dreams.

591
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,890
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you're probably better off for it.

592
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,310
Speaker 1: Law is extremely competitive.

593
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,990
Speaker 1: I mean, my first seven years of practice, I didn't enjoy it at all.

594
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:08,170
Speaker 1: And it was very, very difficult.

595
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:16,530
Speaker 1: And then through a series of circumstances and through some things that I was involved in, I ended up at my current place.

596
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:18,548
Speaker 1: And I like that a lot.

597
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,748
Speaker 1: And it's been very rewarding, too.

598
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,983
Speaker 0: So do you have any hobbies that, like, aren't geeky?

599
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:31,729
Speaker 0: or I mean, is it just pretty much that we would argue that any any hobby becomes geeky?

600
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:32,551
Speaker 0: Exactly.

601
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:37,229
Speaker 0: Like if you told me that you liked, you know, say, snowboarding, I'd say, well, you're a snowboarding geek, but, you know.

602
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:37,974
Speaker 2: Well, maybe not.

603
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:40,930
Speaker 2: Maybe I've never seen a snowboarder actually snowboarding.

604
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:41,920
Speaker 0: So that's yeah.

605
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,790
Speaker 0: But do you have any hobbies that aren't, you know, popularly considered to be geek hobbies for a while?

606
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,268
Speaker 1: I was a serial hobbyist.

607
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:53,470
Speaker 1: I would go from one thing to the next to flying lessons.

608
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:58,370
Speaker 1: I took oil painting lessons, drawing.

609
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,909
Speaker 1: I still do a little pencil drawing.

610
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:10,965
Speaker 1: I did collecting various things from stamps to coins to, you know, I don't even remember all the things now.

611
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:21,690
Speaker 1: From Lego to robot building to I'm just sort of looking around now for the remnants, the vestiges of these hobbies.

612
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:30,389
Speaker 1: And eventually my work got so time consuming that I really only had time for one or two.

613
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,170
Speaker 1: So I still have the sports car and I still have all my computers.

614
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:44,513
Speaker 1: But podcasting is probably, if you can call that a hobby, the only other thing that I do.

615
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:45,366
Speaker 1: But that's geeky.

616
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,513
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

617
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,510
Speaker 0: My friend's dad is a lot like that.

618
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,250
Speaker 0: Like he would go and buy a bowling ball and then he would stop bowling.

619
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,129
Speaker 0: He would bowl a whole bunch and then he would stop.

620
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,750
Speaker 0: And then he would yeah.

621
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,290
Speaker 0: Then he would go and buy something else and do that.

622
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,610
Speaker 0: Like he bought a camera and he'd be taking pictures like crazy and then he would stop.

623
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,070
Speaker 1: And I don't know, it's all part of discovering what you like to do.

624
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:12,870
Speaker 1: I mean, when we on Friday night party line, we make fun of the idea of what what is it?

625
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,473
Speaker 1: that's really fun.

626
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:17,010
Speaker 1: If you're a happy person, like, you know, rim is a happy person.

627
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:22,290
Speaker 1: You can't make the guy unhappy, really, from what we see, at least in the audience.

628
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:22,791
Speaker 1: I don't know.

629
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:26,210
Speaker 1: Maybe he cries himself to sleep every night, but on the inside, maybe.

630
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:27,432
Speaker 2: Yeah.

631
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:32,152
Speaker 2: As people are in, the crew can say it's actually scarier in real life than on the show.

632
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:34,269
Speaker 2: I'm much less cynical in the real world.

633
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:40,549
Speaker 1: So, you know, but there are other people, Scott and me, who are not like that.

634
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:49,690
Speaker 1: And so you spend your life searching for something that is enjoyable, that you can put your time in and get something that's back, that's rewarding.

635
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,638
Speaker 0: I don't need to search.

636
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:51,770
Speaker 0: I just can't get.

637
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,810
Speaker 1: Well, but it becomes a search after a while.

638
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,670
Speaker 1: I mean, you remind me of myself from when I was younger, except I had a girlfriend.

639
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,434
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.

640
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:05,229
Speaker 0: What do you want from me?

641
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,310
Speaker 1: No, it's your rigid thinking, Scott.

642
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,590
Speaker 1: You have so much rigidity in your mind and it stops you from doing things like dating.

643
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,032
Speaker 1: That's all.

644
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:22,050
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I don't think rigidity in my mind to stop me from dating so much as lack of free time.

645
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,489
Speaker 2: Lack of rigidity in other places?

646
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,909
Speaker 0: No, but I have plenty of rigidity in many places.

647
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:42,950
Speaker 0: But I do recognize that there are a lot of things where, like, I come up with like an obvious answer to my problem and then I sort of refuse to execute on that because I feel like it's cheating or I feel like it's sort of wrong.

648
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:43,834
Speaker 2: You know, you're like.

649
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:50,770
Speaker 2: you're like what you're like me when I was a kid and I play video games and I'd run into a boss and it'd be super hard and I couldn't beat him.

650
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,689
Speaker 2: Like, it'd be really difficult.

651
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:58,429
Speaker 2: But then there'd always be like I'd see the really cheap way to beat the boss, like, oh, if I just go around the back and grenade and then he'll die.

652
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,670
Speaker 2: And I remember never wanting to do that.

653
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,289
Speaker 2: And as a result, I never beat video games.

654
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:05,930
Speaker 2: And then I found out later that all these games kind of expected you to do that.

655
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,709
Speaker 2: And that was, in fact, the only way to beat those bosses.

656
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:09,518
Speaker 0: Yeah.

657
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:10,049
Speaker 0: Yeah.

658
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:12,120
Speaker 0: Yeah.

659
00:44:12,305 --> 00:44:12,490
Speaker 0: Yeah.

660
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:13,654
Speaker 1: Yeah.

661
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:14,750
Speaker 1: All right.

662
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,110
Speaker 0: So you are you're you're a fancy lawyer.

663
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,034
Speaker 0: I don't even know what.

664
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:22,650
Speaker 0: actually, you know, there's a lot of lawyers who listen and talk in the forums and are on Friday night party line.

665
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,669
Speaker 2: Did you forget which ones which?

666
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,648
Speaker 0: No, no, I just it's like I know what kind of lawyer all the other lawyers are, but I don't know what kind of lawyer you are.

667
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:35,522
Speaker 1: See, I can't really go into that because I do want to keep this Internet schizophrenia going.

668
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,010
Speaker 0: That's fine.

669
00:44:36,832 --> 00:44:39,630
Speaker 1: And I the type of law that I do is highly specialized.

670
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,470
Speaker 1: So if I go into it at all, I'd be easily spotted.

671
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:43,112
Speaker 0: That's fine.

672
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:49,970
Speaker 0: And that really is an exciting area of law, like intellectual property, or is it or is it lame to normal people?

673
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,810
Speaker 1: I'm not a litigator.

674
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:53,750
Speaker 1: I started out doing commercial litigation.

675
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:54,729
Speaker 1: I can talk about that.

676
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,410
Speaker 1: I hated it because basically it's combative all the time.

677
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:04,830
Speaker 1: You know, four thirty in a Friday afternoon, motions are coming in over the fax machine designed to ruin your weekend.

678
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:09,889
Speaker 0: Are you at least sending out to ruin other people's weekends at the same time?

679
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:11,010
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, sure.

680
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:11,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

681
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,230
Speaker 1: And doing all kinds of things.

682
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,929
Speaker 1: And it's give and take, but I don't want that.

683
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:20,850
Speaker 1: I'm not the kind of lawyer that wants to fight.

684
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:24,690
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'd rather have everybody agree.

685
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,889
Speaker 1: And so litigation is not for me.

686
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:35,950
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, this sort of like this, I don't know, sort of cliche, you know, like, oh, lawyers, they're like the bane of existence.

687
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,890
Speaker 0: You know, they make the world miserable.

688
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:45,230
Speaker 0: So being a lawyer, I guess, is it, you know, do you sort of feel that like, you know, I'm you're evil or what?

689
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,369
Speaker 1: Well, it's it's my evil.

690
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:48,106
Speaker 2: Yeah.

691
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:49,720
Speaker 2: OK.

692
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:56,890
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's sort of like, you know, it's like my uncle's a dentist.

693
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,290
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like people dread, you know, the dentist.

694
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,230
Speaker 0: So it's sort of, you know, he doesn't care.

695
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,210
Speaker 0: But other other, you know, there's there is a high rate of like suicide among dentists.

696
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:06,588
Speaker 0: And that has something to do with it.

697
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:14,090
Speaker 0: So I was wondering if lawyer, you know, what kind of feelings you had being in a, you know, a member of a somewhat despised profession?

698
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you get that a lot and you just have to go with it.

699
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:27,769
Speaker 1: I mean, the idea, the joke about the post office coming out with a commemorative stamp for lawyers, but they had to discontinue it because people couldn't figure out which side of the stamp to spit on.

700
00:46:29,396 --> 00:46:30,169
Speaker 0: I never heard that one.

701
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:33,810
Speaker 1: You get you get you get that.

702
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,630
Speaker 1: But, you know, what I do is helping people.

703
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,430
Speaker 1: It's it's not combative.

704
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,090
Speaker 1: So I don't I don't internalize that.

705
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:46,090
Speaker 1: And I can always blame the plaintiff's lawyers for being the real cause of the problem.

706
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,109
Speaker 1: But you know what?

707
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:48,610
Speaker 1: It's like an onion.

708
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,810
Speaker 1: If you peel that back, it's not really the plaintiff's lawyers.

709
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:52,649
Speaker 1: They're the guns.

710
00:46:53,530 --> 00:47:07,244
Speaker 1: And it's the people that are that are unhappy, that are willing to sue and go through the incredible inconvenience and hassle that a lawsuit is just to have vengeance or make money or what have you.

711
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:25,430
Speaker 0: So, you know, I'm sort of speaking for myself here, but it really feels like lately, especially with all the, you know, the the ways law and technology have been interacting, that, you know, law has become more important for a lot of people in their everyday lives.

712
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:28,050
Speaker 0: But it's also, you know, incredibly complicated.

713
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,389
Speaker 0: You have to go to school for years and years to even, you know, understand it.

714
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:39,989
Speaker 0: And sort of in a situation where, you know, every day people have like lots of questions they want to ask lawyers.

715
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:44,449
Speaker 0: But in order to get an answer, you have to pay someone like it's not it's not free.

716
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,090
Speaker 1: Right.

717
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:54,270
Speaker 0: So it seems like people, they want to follow the law or know it, but it's not something they can understand.

718
00:47:54,852 --> 00:48:01,390
Speaker 0: And it's like it really feels like you have to if you don't have a lot of money, you can't even know what the law is to follow it.

719
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:04,029
Speaker 0: Do you get what I'm saying?

720
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:12,169
Speaker 1: I guess, but most people have a working knowledge of the daily laws that they have to not violate to stay out of jail.

721
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm talking about

722
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:30,649
Speaker 2: actually, I would argue that maybe it's just geeks and technology people, but a lot of the things that I do on a daily basis get very close to gray areas of the law where I'm not sure anymore, because a lot of laws that relate to these areas just aren't clear.

723
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,970
Speaker 2: And even our company lawyers are like, I don't know, I just don't know.

724
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,410
Speaker 2: And there's there's not enough body of case law to kind of have a precedent or anything.

725
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:41,070
Speaker 2: And the judges don't understand.

726
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,250
Speaker 2: And there's no way in hell a jury's going to understand.

727
00:48:44,232 --> 00:48:47,270
Speaker 2: And I mean, I guess I should be the one who's out there as the expert witness.

728
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:49,730
Speaker 2: But then all I'm doing is explaining the technology.

729
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,769
Speaker 2: And then the lawyer still has to tell me what I like, how to translate what I just said into what the law says.

730
00:48:55,151 --> 00:49:01,130
Speaker 0: If you haven't guessed, I'm pretty much taking advantage of the fact that you're a lawyer and you're on the show to save myself some money.

731
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:06,330
Speaker 2: So you're planning to to possibly break some laws, apparently?

732
00:49:06,512 --> 00:49:06,770
Speaker 0: I don't know.

733
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:10,589
Speaker 0: Is it is it against the law for me to just if you just answer law questions for me?

734
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:17,788
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not licensed in New York state, so I can't give you legal advice on New York law.

735
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,050
Speaker 1: But we can talk about hypothetically and generally speaking.

736
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,088
Speaker 0: That's good enough.

737
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,287
Speaker 2: So how do you feel about we do it?

738
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,170
Speaker 2: I want to derail.

739
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,270
Speaker 2: We won't go on too long about this.

740
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,670
Speaker 2: But there's a story recently about a guy who is taking photographs and he wasn't violating any laws.

741
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:32,969
Speaker 2: He was taking them in a public place.

742
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:34,810
Speaker 2: But the police harassed him.

743
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,610
Speaker 2: I think they eventually arrested him and all this business.

744
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:42,870
Speaker 2: And in the end, it was determined that he was not violating a single law.

745
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:56,970
Speaker 2: And yet because the police neither the police nor him nor anyone involved until it got to court even knew the law or knew that whether or not there was even a law that covered the situation, that this person could be arrested for committing absolutely no crime.

746
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,270
Speaker 2: And there was no even evidence that he committed a crime.

747
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:01,489
Speaker 1: That's not surprising to me at all.

748
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:01,981
Speaker 2: Yeah.

749
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:03,490
Speaker 2: And I don't know.

750
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,270
Speaker 2: I don't really have a question.

751
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,169
Speaker 2: What do we do about that?

752
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:11,070
Speaker 2: Because technology is making it more easy to run into these situations like with photography.

753
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:14,490
Speaker 2: How many pictures are taken in public constantly?

754
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:21,130
Speaker 2: And it seems like no police officer in this country understands that it's legal to take a picture from public place as far as I'm aware.

755
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:21,789
Speaker 2: And I'm not a lawyer.

756
00:50:22,714 --> 00:50:23,930
Speaker 1: You guys talked about this, right?

757
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:27,370
Speaker 1: You mentioned the standard of reasonable expectation of privacy.

758
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,248
Speaker 1: Someone said that.

759
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,030
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's one of my hot buttons.

760
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,140
Speaker 2: So it's one thing I actually did.

761
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,949
Speaker 2: as much research as a non-lawyer can do.

762
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,089
Speaker 1: You know, Ray from Friday Night Party Line is an expert on this area of law.

763
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:40,269
Speaker 1: He is nationally known on this point.

764
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:45,170
Speaker 1: But basically it is that, that reasonable expectation of privacy.

765
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,309
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the police have immense power and they can always arrest you.

766
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:54,070
Speaker 1: Just because you haven't actually broken the law, that'll get figured out later.

767
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:54,725
Speaker 1: Maybe.

768
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:02,110
Speaker 1: And if you have perfect faith in the system and then you don't use a lawyer to defend yourself, you're probably going to get convicted.

769
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:08,990
Speaker 1: Really it's a power system, not so much a system of justice.

770
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:16,310
Speaker 1: It's, so, you know, some of the stories you've told, Rem, about how you've pushed the envelope with police officers.

771
00:51:17,312 --> 00:51:22,070
Speaker 1: I would cringe when I heard it because you were counting on your rights to be upheld.

772
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:28,708
Speaker 1: And they're really not, it's just, it's almost happenstance if that's actually how it's going to work out.

773
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:41,170
Speaker 2: Yeah, sadly I've gotten to the point now where I'm of the mind that I should carry surveillance on me at all times so that if I have an interaction, let's say, with the police, there's some sort of external record of it to vindicate me in the future.

774
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:47,610
Speaker 1: Well, often they are recorded themselves and the fastest way to get arrested is to start videotaping a police officer.

775
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,928
Speaker 1: And in fact, that might be a good way to get tased too.

776
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:54,330
Speaker 0: Even though it's perfectly okay.

777
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,910
Speaker 0: I mean, where would Rodney King be if we weren't allowed to videotape police officers?

778
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:08,370
Speaker 1: But yeah, we're supposed to have this, the First Amendment and everything else, so theoretically you should be able to, but in some states it's not legal to do that.

779
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,802
Speaker 0: Are there any particular things in law that are like really, like they really bother you a lot?

780
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,810
Speaker 2: I mean, you can avoid talking about things that might reveal your secret identity.

781
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:34,869
Speaker 1: And I wish I didn't have to do the secret identity thing, but you know, if you work for a place that might care and I go out of my way to try to do what you do, Scott, and do something that would embarrass me.

782
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,129
Speaker 1: But I'm a human being and I might make a mistake.

783
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:42,030
Speaker 1: So I have the pseudonym as sort of an extra layer of protection.

784
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:46,530
Speaker 1: That way I can have fun, you know, this being one of the few things I consider fun in life.

785
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:54,667
Speaker 1: But yeah, the things that bug me, I mean, the whole copyright thing is really hard to understand.

786
00:52:55,731 --> 00:53:12,648
Speaker 1: This mux tape thing that's out now where you can upload your songs, create a mix and have other people listen to them, I'm waiting for that to just blow up because basically you could buy a new CD, put it up track by track and that, and then anybody in the world could listen to that CD.

787
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:13,969
Speaker 1: Why would they buy it?

788
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:17,570
Speaker 1: You're just using the internet as a giant hard drive for everybody to listen to.

789
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:18,810
Speaker 1: They don't have to download it.

790
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,125
Speaker 1: They can listen to it when they want to.

791
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:22,669
Speaker 1: So that's going to go down.

792
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:23,688
Speaker 1: They're going to attack that.

793
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:35,749
Speaker 1: The RIAA has, is, you know, some of the things they want to put in place in terms of federal laws, they want to have a copyright czar who's on par with the war on drugs czar.

794
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,970
Speaker 1: I mean, that's crazy.

795
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:45,428
Speaker 1: They want to break down people's houses and see if you happen to copy an old video tape from 10 years ago.

796
00:53:45,830 --> 00:54:02,748
Speaker 2: This is why I've actually been very interested in, and I've asked a lot of people about how to do this before because I really want to be one of those expert witnesses for all these cases because I think I would enjoy it because I like to expound upon things that might make other people angry.

797
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:07,650
Speaker 1: Unless you like being sodomized by lawyers because that's what they do to expert witnesses.

798
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:18,068
Speaker 1: You have to be, I mean, the expert witnesses you see on TV, well, if it's a big enough case, they'll hire private investigators to follow you around to try to dig up details in your personal life.

799
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:22,210
Speaker 1: They'll look at everything you've ever said in public or in private.

800
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,650
Speaker 1: Masturbation episode of Geek Nights, exhibit A in your testimony after you're done.

801
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,390
Speaker 0: But how is that relevant to my computer knowledge?

802
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,490
Speaker 2: Well, what if it's a case about pedophiles or something?

803
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,430
Speaker 0: I'm not going to testify in a pedophile case.

804
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,610
Speaker 2: But that's the most common case on the internet.

805
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,300
Speaker 2: It's either that or it's copyright.

806
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,049
Speaker 0: I guess.

807
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:44,508
Speaker 1: So they would have a field day with you.

808
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:49,070
Speaker 0: No, that's that's the kind of thing that bothers me is sort of like this.

809
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:53,405
Speaker 0: You know, why are they attacking my character when I'm just there to tell them how computers work?

810
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,152
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

811
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:55,823
Speaker 0: if I know computers work, what does it matter?

812
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:58,069
Speaker 0: if I'm you know, what else is true about me?

813
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:16,389
Speaker 2: Well, my real interest is that, you know, you brought up the RIAA and copyright, but as a technology professional and ignoring the legal aspect of it, from everything I've read about these cases, they've never presented technological evidence that was even close to being useful ever in any of these RIAA cases.

814
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:17,849
Speaker 1: It's what they're talking about.

815
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:18,987
Speaker 1: So they can fudge it.

816
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:25,944
Speaker 1: If you can get in a courtroom and most of these are small state courtrooms and state court, you know, you don't want to be there.

817
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:26,710
Speaker 1: if you don't have to.

818
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:31,510
Speaker 1: And you're not going to have the high level of expertise that you will in federal court.

819
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:33,769
Speaker 2: And I feel like this is a big problem.

820
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:45,107
Speaker 2: I feel like if it like, in addition to having a jury of your peers, you should have the right to at least have an expert witness who understands the issue at hand in any court case.

821
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:54,210
Speaker 0: I mean, like, you know, you have a jury, but if the case is about, you know, computers and no one on the jury has ever used a computer, how are they?

822
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,149
Speaker 0: I mean, how are they my peers?

823
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:57,361
Speaker 0: They're not.

824
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,310
Speaker 1: It's just that's just jargon.

825
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,810
Speaker 1: There's no such thing as peers, but they're going to, you know, RIM's on trial.

826
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:11,830
Speaker 1: They're going to go out and find people, you know, 12 people with IQs of 140 plus who have technology backgrounds.

827
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:12,302
Speaker 1: Wrong.

828
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,870
Speaker 1: They're going to find people who can't figure out how to get out of jury duty.

829
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,950
Speaker 2: The sad thing is I wanted to serve on jury.

830
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,450
Speaker 2: Every time I'm called, I really want to serve on the jury and I do everything right.

831
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,090
Speaker 2: And I'm there and I'm always immediately dismissed.

832
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:29,149
Speaker 2: As soon as they like, look at me, they kick me out and I'm done.

833
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:32,999
Speaker 0: It's just no good.

834
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:35,632
Speaker 2: In fact, when I worked at the hospital, I was told.

835
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:38,200
Speaker 2: basically I said, yeah, I'm a technology professional for a hospital.

836
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,080
Speaker 2: They said, oh, you don't have to serve on a jury.

837
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:41,100
Speaker 2: And they let me go.

838
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:45,056
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

839
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:46,369
Speaker 0: Yeah.

840
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:47,758
Speaker 0: Let's see.

841
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,980
Speaker 0: Do I have any other lawyer-y questions?

842
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,379
Speaker 0: Well, it is, you know, it's like there's a whole.

843
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,420
Speaker 0: It's like, I kind of.

844
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,340
Speaker 2: So what's the legal distinction between flotsam and jetsam if we're in international waters?

845
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,280
Speaker 1: I'm not a maritime lawyer.

846
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,738
Speaker 1: You should have Carney on, though, because his perspective as a prosecutor is different than mine.

847
00:57:11,547 --> 00:57:12,080
Speaker 0: Maybe we will.

848
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,299
Speaker 0: It could be pretty cool.

849
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:15,862
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like.

850
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:21,100
Speaker 0: lately I've actually run into like a few sort of like situations where it's kind of like I need a lawyer.

851
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,560
Speaker 0: Like we sort of want to officially make like a business like front row crew studios or something.

852
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,480
Speaker 0: And we also kind of want to like buy a house.

853
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:32,600
Speaker 0: But since there's a whole bunch of us, we might need like a real estate lawyer.

854
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:36,700
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, how do I like find a lawyer?

855
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,419
Speaker 0: How do I know I'm not getting ripped off?

856
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,179
Speaker 0: How do I, you know, I don't know how to do any of those things.

857
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:44,700
Speaker 1: The Bar Association will probably have a referral service.

858
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,719
Speaker 1: At the very least, you can try that.

859
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,520
Speaker 1: Talking to lawyers who know other lawyers is a very good way to find people.

860
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,859
Speaker 1: You guys do like to do a lot of stuff yourself.

861
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,820
Speaker 1: And they're, you know, certainly with setting up an LLC, you can probably do that yourself.

862
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:04,580
Speaker 1: You can learn a lot just by going to the website for the Secretary of State.

863
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,400
Speaker 1: And it's not hard and it's not expensive.

864
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,717
Speaker 1: I just set up an LLC that's going to own Friday Night Party Line and anything else that I do online now.

865
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,870
Speaker 2: Because actually the worst thing is.

866
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:17,980
Speaker 2: that's what I was thinking.

867
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,280
Speaker 2: Like, all right, LLC, whatever.

868
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:28,300
Speaker 2: And then we got advice from people who kept saying, no, you got to make a Delaware whatever thing and you got to do this and that and issue stock and blah, blah, blah.

869
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:35,940
Speaker 2: Then we run into the fact that with my job, I'm legally barred from having control over investments or owning stock or anything like that.

870
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:36,899
Speaker 2: And there's all this trouble.

871
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,860
Speaker 1: Business entities are very flexible.

872
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:57,900
Speaker 1: If it turned out that you do your LLC just for tax purposes and then later if someone wants to buy it or they want to invest in it and they're out of state and there's SEC issues, you can convert it into another entity.

873
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:01,800
Speaker 1: There are many, many things you can do and they're all very flexible.

874
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,500
Speaker 1: So start out with what you can do now.

875
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:17,148
Speaker 1: Set up an LLC, get a tax ID number, get a business account, get a PayPal business account and then you're good to go for pretty much anything for the next few years unless somebody is going to pay you $1.75 billion like CBS did for CNET.

876
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:26,240
Speaker 0: I mean, if I had $1.75 billion, I would probably buy like a sports team, right?

877
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:27,580
Speaker 0: Why would you buy CNET?

878
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:29,438
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

879
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,640
Speaker 2: Depends on the sports team.

880
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,040
Speaker 0: It does.

881
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:32,360
Speaker 1: Why is CBS bought CNET?

882
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,239
Speaker 1: Because they're afraid.

883
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,460
Speaker 1: All of the newspapers in the world are declining.

884
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,620
Speaker 1: Nobody watches TV and when they do watch TV, they time shift it or they don't watch it at all anymore.

885
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,900
Speaker 1: When you can watch anything you want at any time, you don't watch anything.

886
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:57,780
Speaker 2: Well, I just feel like there's, I mean, this is a topic for a whole separate discussion, but I feel like in the next, God, I want to live a time frame.

887
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:04,720
Speaker 2: I'd say within the next decade, definitely, there's going to be a rapid fundamental shift in the way media is presented and consumed.

888
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,500
Speaker 2: I think it's going to, I think the ramifications are going to be far reaching and longterm and frightening to a lot of people.

889
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:17,600
Speaker 0: I think we're definitely, you know, we're sort of climbing the roller coaster now and in a few years we're going to be going over the top and then it's downhill.

890
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:29,970
Speaker 1: But CNET, according, you know, CBS looks at CNET and they say, okay, they're doing internet TV, they're doing IPTV, we'll buy them and then we'll have IPTV too.

891
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,408
Speaker 1: But you know, are they doing it very well?

892
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,880
Speaker 1: Do they really have that strong of a presence?

893
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,790
Speaker 1: to what kind of credibility do they have?

894
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:37,450
Speaker 1: I don't know.

895
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:41,389
Speaker 0: Well, they've got, they've got a name seen as a somewhat well known name.

896
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:42,970
Speaker 1: They're well known.

897
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:46,510
Speaker 1: And if you pump a lot of money into it, I mean, they do things on a shoestring.

898
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:52,969
Speaker 1: If you start pumping money into them, maybe, maybe that it'll, it'll do for CBS what CBS wants.

899
01:00:53,652 --> 01:01:09,750
Speaker 1: And I think that ultimately when people can watch videos and TV shows literally anytime they want to, when they're on a bus, when they're, you know, and there, and there's no iPod necessary, you know, there's no storage media.

900
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:14,250
Speaker 1: Everything is, anything you could ever want is immediately delivered instantaneously.

901
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:18,990
Speaker 1: Then, you know, that's probably what you're talking about, Scott.

902
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:19,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

903
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,309
Speaker 2: Well, it gets, it gets really tricky then.

904
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:31,310
Speaker 2: Cause I, I, I'm still debating if I want to write an article or something about it, but it's not just that you have to compete with the other media out there and even not even talk about monetization.

905
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,370
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, this is a great idea.

906
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:33,209
Speaker 0: I love this.

907
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,729
Speaker 2: You can't, we also now, every piece of media we make has to compete with every piece of media that ever came out.

908
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:40,870
Speaker 2: And I'm thinking of titling this little short book.

909
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,269
Speaker 2: Like you can't compete with the past.

910
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:50,200
Speaker 2: I mean, there are more movies that have been made in the history of movie making that are probably worth for me watching to where.

911
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:54,289
Speaker 2: if movies were not made for the rest of my life, I don't think I would run out of movies to watch.

912
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:55,167
Speaker 0: Yeah.

913
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:59,670
Speaker 0: It's because back in, like when I was a kid, right, it, it pretty much, it costs something.

914
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:02,569
Speaker 0: It was difficult to get anything, especially if it was old.

915
01:02:02,831 --> 01:02:05,770
Speaker 0: I mean, if something was old, it was incredibly difficult to get.

916
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,670
Speaker 0: The only real stuff you can get was new stuff.

917
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:12,390
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much if new stuff didn't come out, you really couldn't see anything.

918
01:02:12,652 --> 01:02:14,310
Speaker 0: Cause you would just be sort of quiet.

919
01:02:14,812 --> 01:02:22,870
Speaker 0: But now with you, not only do I have access to like all, everything that's new, but I have access to pretty much everything that has ever existed.

920
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:35,330
Speaker 0: I mean, there's old TV shows, old comic books, old radio shows, old movies, old music, old everything, you know, for as long as humans have had recording technology, photographs, everything.

921
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:51,570
Speaker 0: So there's so much that already exists and there is so much being created at any one time that the value of something new is significantly decreased because the supply of things in total is just so large that it's like, I don't need new things.

922
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,510
Speaker 0: I can live on the old or the current.

923
01:02:53,831 --> 01:02:57,970
Speaker 2: I mean, I haven't even finished reading Herodotus or Xenophon, let alone.

924
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:08,190
Speaker 1: You need an Amazon Kindle that lets you buy anything you ever wanted right now, anywhere you are, because it has the free wireless.

925
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:15,090
Speaker 2: Actually someone, I'm at this training for this gigantic like enterprise thing I bought for work and all week and down on wall street actually.

926
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:19,050
Speaker 2: And three of the guys, they all have Kindles and I got to play with it for a while.

927
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,870
Speaker 2: They had lent me to, you know, Hey, check this out.

928
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:21,185
Speaker 2: It's cool.

929
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:26,682
Speaker 2: And I'm probably going to buy one as soon as like the next revision comes out, like revision two.

930
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely, yeah.

931
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,388
Speaker 0: If there's a revision two of the Kindle, I might go for it.

932
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:35,048
Speaker 1: But yes, cause how many times have you wanted to book and not been able to get your hands on one here?

933
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:37,470
Speaker 1: You know, when you guys are talking about the Prince of Nothing, oh, okay.

934
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,650
Speaker 1: Touch three buttons and I have the copy.

935
01:03:40,431 --> 01:03:41,550
Speaker 0: I think it's relevant to bring up.

936
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:46,810
Speaker 0: Remember in the Prince of Nothing episode, I talked about, you know, I was thinking of setting up an Amazon Associates thing, right?

937
01:03:46,872 --> 01:03:46,938
Speaker 2: Yup.

938
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:48,088
Speaker 0: Well, I did.

939
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:52,310
Speaker 0: And you know, all the links to the three Prince of Nothing books were Associates links.

940
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:57,230
Speaker 0: And you know, I'm not, you know, I don't want to like, you know, I'm fully disclosing here.

941
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,149
Speaker 0: We made a lot of money from that.

942
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:03,369
Speaker 0: Like a lot, like I get paid the Libsyn bill and then more so.

943
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:07,947
Speaker 0: And like if we sell one Kindle through Associates, we get like $40 per Kindle.

944
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,350
Speaker 0: It's like ludicrous.

945
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:17,850
Speaker 0: And I sort of don't feel bad doing that because it's like, you know, you people who click on those links and buy products are not paying anymore.

946
01:04:18,394 --> 01:04:19,770
Speaker 0: It's just we're basically taking money.

947
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,870
Speaker 0: Amazon would have had an Amazon pocket.

948
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:31,170
Speaker 2: The only reason it becomes, it would become bad would be if we started purposefully talking about things we wouldn't otherwise talk about and hyping them up just to get the link.

949
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:39,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not going to hype up Kindles just because I'll make $40 off of them, you know, even though, you know, it is somewhat enticing, but there's no way that's going to happen.

950
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,130
Speaker 0: But yeah.

951
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:45,069
Speaker 1: I reviewed HGTV on my blog and I got mad hits on it.

952
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,390
Speaker 1: If I would have done that, I would probably have made thousands of dollars.

953
01:04:48,990 --> 01:05:01,841
Speaker 0: And I started looking around and there's actually a lot of websites have like these Associates programs, like Newegg has one, Right Stuff has one, Fun Again, which sells board games, has one, you know, I don't

954
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,710
Speaker 2: think I'd go with Right Stuff because, well,

955
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:04,368
Speaker 0: no, we can go to Amazon.

956
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:10,589
Speaker 2: But I'm saying even with the whole, even with Amazon, when DVDs, I feel like Netflix is killing the anime DVD.

957
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:12,466
Speaker 0: Maybe Netflix has a thingy.

958
01:05:13,634 --> 01:05:13,827
Speaker 0: Who knows?

959
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,030
Speaker 2: Everyone already has Netflix.

960
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:16,206
Speaker 0: I know, I know, I know.

961
01:05:16,752 --> 01:05:19,149
Speaker 1: But if you produce content, you should make money on it.

962
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:26,197
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's tricky because like the anime industry is a good example of this where, you know, you can't compete with the past.

963
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:33,310
Speaker 2: and so much anime is being released in the US and as someone aptly put it, they try to make all their money selling DVDs.

964
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:37,170
Speaker 2: But that's like the Wheel of Fortune trying to make money off of selling DVDs.

965
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,590
Speaker 2: Like it's this disposable medium.

966
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:46,410
Speaker 2: These are shows that air once a week and like everyone watches them and then they forget about them and no one watches them again.

967
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:55,090
Speaker 2: They're like these serial million episode monstrosities and they make a ton of money in Japan with TV advertising and, you know, merchandising and all that stuff.

968
01:05:55,592 --> 01:05:57,339
Speaker 2: But in the US, they've got this market of.

969
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,551
Speaker 2: they try to sell these DVDs and no one buys them.

970
01:06:01,173 --> 01:06:09,530
Speaker 2: and as huge anime fan as I am, I really never buy anime DVDs and there's no reason to because I can rent them perfectly legally.

971
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:10,599
Speaker 2: I don't even need to steal them.

972
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:14,890
Speaker 2: But as a result, the anime industry is collapsing.

973
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:17,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of sad.

974
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,210
Speaker 0: All right, it's getting a little... Do you want to end it here?

975
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,269
Speaker 0: Do you got anything else?

976
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,490
Speaker 2: I guess we could wrap it up.

977
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,589
Speaker 2: We've gone on a good hour.

978
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:26,570
Speaker 0: No, that's good.

979
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:27,290
Speaker 0: I can go eat dinner.

980
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,110
Speaker 0: So, Thade, is there anything like you particularly want to like promote?

981
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,290
Speaker 0: Anything you want to, you know, tell people?

982
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:41,590
Speaker 1: Oh, just Friday Night Party line because, you know, you guys have been a part of it and I hope that you'll continue to be a part of it as we really ramp things up in the next few months.

983
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:48,410
Speaker 1: I don't want to go through the list of people that we've asked to be guests, but some of them have been on Oprah.

984
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,949
Speaker 0: So it's not Tom Cruise, is it?

985
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:57,130
Speaker 1: No, that would be interesting.

986
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:09,190
Speaker 1: But I mean, the plan for Friday Night Party line is to monetize it to an extent only really to satisfy my own hobbyist interests of being able to afford to get high-end guests.

987
01:07:10,052 --> 01:07:11,842
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I have the opposite take of like.

988
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:19,610
Speaker 2: I haven't been on it nearly as often as Scott, but I always want to because I would... Making money or whatever, it's just really fun to be on that show.

989
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:22,230
Speaker 2: It's a lot more enjoyable than doing geek nights.

990
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,389
Speaker 0: That's the reason I do it.

991
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:27,090
Speaker 0: I look at that topic list and I'm like, oh, man, I got something to say about that.

992
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:27,989
Speaker 0: Everyone's going to hear it.

993
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:28,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was great.

994
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,110
Speaker 2: We'd love to have you on more often.

995
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,690
Speaker 2: I want to set up some interesting topical round table.

996
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,950
Speaker 2: I don't want to step on Friday Night Party line's toes.

997
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,370
Speaker 2: Definitely want to go with a different kind of format.

998
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:46,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, these podcasts are so personal that even if you had the exact same setup, it wouldn't be the same show because of your personality.

999
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:50,210
Speaker 2: And again, that it's very hard to get a word in edgewise.

1000
01:07:51,172 --> 01:07:51,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

1001
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,220
Speaker 2: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1002
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,860
Speaker 2: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1015
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:14,540
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
