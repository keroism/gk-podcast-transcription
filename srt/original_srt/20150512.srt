17
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:14,400
Speaker 1: if you have a stereo probably less accurate.

18
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:25,747
Speaker 1: Yeah if you have a stereotype of Hong Kong based primarily on like Asian cinema if you go to Hong Kong, you will know your way around and You'll feel like you're just in those movies.

19
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:31,854
Speaker 1: Hong Kong is so close to every stereotype I had about it that it was kind of shocking.

20
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,450
Speaker 1: I Fucking love Hong Kong.

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,014

Speaker 1: Uh, so everyone's smart there went out of their way to remind me Yeah, but Hong Kong's ruined.

24
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,790
Speaker 1: China's gonna completely fuck it over.

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,659
Speaker 1: We're all like ready to leave as soon as they finally complete fucking it.

26
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:56,292
Speaker 1: Everyone there I talked to said something to the effect of I wish Britain had gone to war Rather than turn Hong Kong over to China.

27
00:01:56,453 --> 00:02:05,999
Speaker 1: Wow, like people Really don't want China and most of these people are ethnically Chinese but culturally Hong Kong ease.

28
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:06,983
Speaker 1: Hong Kong.

29
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:14,196
Speaker 1: ease culture is closer to New York City culture than it is to mainland China culture Mmm, I get that feeling.

30
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:14,901
Speaker 1: in fact You know what.

31
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:22,647
Speaker 1: New York City culture is closer to Hong Kong than it is to like upstate New York culture Mmm, and and the most fucked up thing.

32
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:29,368
Speaker 1: So I was staying at this super sweet hotel like right in Lfk lkf.

33
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:34,439
Speaker 1: I keep saying lfk like It's lkf like one I can.

34
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:41,824
Speaker 1: Everyone I knew I met there who wasn't who didn't like grow up speaking a variant of Chinese Can't like.

35
00:02:41,864 --> 00:02:44,320
Speaker 1: they know nouns, but they cannot speak Chinese.

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,500
Speaker 1: They have all tried for many many years to learn Cantonese and just can't speak it.

37
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,310
Speaker 1: But they know all the nouns mostly to rename places.

38
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,250
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I'm in this lkf area and There's awesome hotel.

39
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,580
Speaker 0: now you're saving this for Thursday.

40
00:02:58,822 --> 00:03:01,019
Speaker 1: No, this is one little bit because you know the New York thing.

41
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:15,531
Speaker 1: so I'm walking like in the lobby like across there's like this glass door to the outside and I walked past it and I did what can only be described as a comedy movie like Overly dramatic over acted double-take.

42
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:25,140
Speaker 1: as I stop shake my head Walk backward and look out and sure enough I see the entrance to like the Prince Street and our station.

43
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:33,140
Speaker 1: There is this completely legit, New York City subway station sign complete with like the green like.

44
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,992
Speaker 1: You know that green painted and everything.

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,220
Speaker 0: Oh, is it like a bar?

46
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,728
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like the entrance to a bar and it's just there.

47
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,071
Speaker 1: my brain was fucked up by that the whole time I was there like every time I saw it.

48
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,000
Speaker 1: My brain was like, oh, I'll just take the subway.

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,548
Speaker 1: No, you can't take the subway.

50
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:52,120
Speaker 0: that bar will not take you to your house though, if you get drunk there your brain might go to your.

51
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:58,667
Speaker 1: But yeah, so I'll tell you about Hong Kong Coming up in the future.

52
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,740
Speaker 1: So in the news now that we're back from the head is the game.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,983
Speaker 1: There's lots of gaming news.

54
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:09,400
Speaker 0: We're not gonna talk about Kojima or PT because we don't know enough about what's going on yet.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:19,404
Speaker 1: We're waiting for the whole story to finish and then boom Yeah in fact The most interesting news I can find is that an insider made a YouTube video kind of talking about it and they made a DMCA Request to pull it down.

56
00:04:19,485 --> 00:04:21,733
Speaker 0: Yeah, so so interesting.

57
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is such drama.

58
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,460
Speaker 1: Wow, and this is in the backdrop.

59
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:25,801
Speaker 1: This is

60
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,728
Speaker 0: the most drama in video game ever

61
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:42,577
Speaker 1: and remember the backdrop of this crazy drama is multiple Famous and for real important Japanese gaming visionaries all in a relatively short span of time Quitting leaving or variously kick-starting and basically making the games they want to make

62
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,460
Speaker 0: more on that soon.

63
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:46,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, but I do want to point out this Kojima thing.

64
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,669
Speaker 0: This is going to be if you're not paying attention to this.

65
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,100
Speaker 0: This is epic gaming history news, right?

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:02,460
Speaker 0: Like there's certain things in gaming history that are big moments like, you know Square when square gave Nintendo the finger and put Final Fantasy on the PlayStation, right?

67
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,480
Speaker 0: Well think about how much the world changed like if you were making a timeline of video game.

68
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,940
Speaker 0: You know history, there would be many things on that timeline.

69
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,720
Speaker 0: Kojima fired by Konami is on the list of foot.

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,291
Speaker 0: You know things that would make it to the timeline that when it was zoomed way out We don't even 100% know.

71
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:21,238
Speaker 1: if you like we don't know.

72
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:26,455
Speaker 0: Pretty sure we're gonna find out which is why we're not going into any details until we're 100% sure.

73
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:33,380
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so I guess you got some news related to this related to this topic at least sure.

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:45,300
Speaker 0: So Koji Igarashi a Japanese game developing person who you may or may not have heard of he is a dude who has worked on many many Vania games all one of my favorite kinds of games.

75
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:55,000
Speaker 0: He's like the co-director on Symphony of the Night and then he's sort of like, you know It was the number one person pushing that genre and working on other games like that for many many years.

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:07,860
Speaker 0: so many of the things you like about those types of games are a result of this man's work, so Apparently, you know other the big game companies in Japan don't want to make those kind of games.

77
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,511
Speaker 0: But he recognizes that.

78
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,420
Speaker 0: hey people want to play these kind of games.

79
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,353
Speaker 0: So he's kick-starting one called blood-stained ritual of the night.

80
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:17,176
Speaker 0: man likes blood.

81
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:21,810
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It's already raised like seven hundred thousand dollars.

82
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,600
Speaker 0: I kicked it when it was still in like the hundreds.

83
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:26,574
Speaker 0: Yep, because I got brain.

84
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,239
Speaker 0: who's in charge?

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,546
Speaker 0: He's in charge of gaming.

86
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,199
Speaker 0: a Kickstarter tweeted it immediately as soon as it.

87
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, and his tweet was so like I didn't realize what it was.

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,142
Speaker 0: He was just like.

89
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,347
Speaker 0: we want to know how.

90
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:39,318
Speaker 0: his tweet was whip whip whip link and I clicked on it.

91
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,582
Speaker 0: and I'm like Oh Castlevania.

92
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,605
Speaker 0: that explains the whipping.

93
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:46,700
Speaker 0: and then I watched the video and then while I was watching the video I gave them money.

94
00:06:46,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I said I didn't even watch the video I scrolled down on the Kickstarter and I saw the concept art and I was like Oh So Sun is a Kickstarter but a miserable pile of rim spends 40 hours playing this game.

95
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,248
Speaker 1: Like a hundred percent.

96
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,400
Speaker 0: it's only 28 bucks to get a digital copy.

97
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,712
Speaker 1: 110 percents it in the upside-down castle.

98
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:11,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gave 28 bucks just to get the game.

99
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,847
Speaker 1: That's what I gave.

100
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,426
Speaker 0: is I don't need physical good I don't need any of the garbage.

101
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,560
Speaker 1: one already backed it at the five thousand dollar level.

102
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, listen, even if you don't want to like play this game don't.

103
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:24,708
Speaker 0: if you don't want to play it don't kickstart it Right, but come and watch the video.

104
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:28,239
Speaker 0: It isn't one of the excellent Kickstarter videos of all time.

105
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:39,999
Speaker 0: It was the video was helped made by two-player productions who used to do videos or penny arcade I mean pretty much in my opinion like symphony the night number one Dawn of Sorrow number two.

106
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,373
Speaker 1: If anything's gonna dethrone one of those games, it's gonna be this.

107
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:48,850
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know could suck He might fuck it up, but I'm optimistic.

108
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:54,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, but one thing that our good friend Daryl Surratt pointed out, right?

109
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:58,740
Speaker 0: Oh, wait, let me find is let me find his tweet.

110
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,607
Speaker 1: I think I know what's tweet you're about to say.

111
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,479
Speaker 1: cuz I favorited that tweet cuz I was gonna bring it up.

112
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,431
Speaker 0: Thing about Kickstarter is the big money demand isn't genre driven.

113
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,517
Speaker 0: It's previously established creator driven.

114
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,865
Speaker 1: Oh No, no, that's not true.

115
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:15,818
Speaker 1: A lot of bullshit gets a ton of money because it's purely genre driven.

116
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:16,540
Speaker 0: That is true.

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:29,537
Speaker 0: however, I do want he is true in the case of this one thing because If you look there have been a ton of Vanya like, you know Metroid Vanya genre indie games out in recent years.

118
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:33,655
Speaker 0: We go to PAX You see like ten of these things and they're all pretty mediocre.

119
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:34,720
Speaker 0: They're all kind of mad.

120
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,015
Speaker 0: That's why that they're not raking in big money on Kickstarter is not because of the.

121
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:44,388
Speaker 0: it's not the genre It's not the creator It's the quality.

122
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:52,332
Speaker 0: and it just so happens that someone who's made You know and being the producer director of so many of these is Gonna be able to deliver on the quality.

123
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:57,877
Speaker 0: if we people had the confidence That one of these crappy indie ones is gonna be any good It would also make a bunch of money.

124
00:08:58,401 --> 00:08:59,383
Speaker 0: but without it's it.

125
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,210
Speaker 0: the creator doesn't you know, not necessarily.

126
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:10,031
Speaker 0: the fact that their name brings the money is that their name is a Somewhat insurance on the quality that brings the money.

127
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:16,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it sucks, you've got a virtual boy Congratulations, you can bitch about it is gonna be hilarious.

128
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:19,038
Speaker 0: So that's how that's what's going on there?

129
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,700
Speaker 1: I'm like, I'm pretty invested in this game already.

130
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:25,590
Speaker 1: Problem is now I gotta wait for the game.

131
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,852
Speaker 1: I guess I did, you know, I'm so long Maybe I should just play all the DS ones again.

132
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:31,300
Speaker 1: I've probably forgotten them by this point.

133
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,434
Speaker 0: I still hadn't didn't beat those GBA ones.

134
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:36,837
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Forgot all about those.

135
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,064
Speaker 0: It's quite a few.

136
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:41,819
Speaker 1: thing is I think a DS is just the best one because of how freaking long it is.

137
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, well longer the better.

138
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,984
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean not.

139
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:49,259
Speaker 1: not often will I tolerate the like 80 hours of game but with a Vanya that's good.

140
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,488
Speaker 1: I'll tolerate a lot.

141
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,305
Speaker 1: I'll do a lot of things that I would not do Tonight again.

142
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, they super Metroid again.

143
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:58,819
Speaker 0: Yeah again again again again.

144
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,351
Speaker 1: This is why with anime with video games with books with everything.

145
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,880
Speaker 1: It's real easy to like start watching.

146
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,760
Speaker 1: It's like start playing a modern indie game get about a couple hours in and say wow This kind of reminds me of half-life 2. why don't I just go play half-life 2 again?

147
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,339
Speaker 0: Sounds like a good idea.

148
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,170
Speaker 1: Actually, I started playing a half-life 2 again kind of recently just randomly why not?

149
00:10:20,632 --> 00:10:27,472
Speaker 1: So in other news remember Freeman when good old games Recently released x-wing and high five.

150
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:29,100
Speaker 0: I think that's around the last time we did a geek night.

151
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:38,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was probably our news and that was huge news because x-wing whatever These are games that are in a genre that is truly dead and while x-wings not a game really like.

152
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:47,167
Speaker 1: to be honest high fighter Might have been what like not what it was one of the best PC games ever Made like that is.

153
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:49,620
Speaker 1: that is a fact that is not in dispute.

154
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:54,256
Speaker 1: Never forget that high fighter got the highest rating in what PC gamer.

155
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,863
Speaker 1: I think that was the magazine back Ever.

156
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:59,960
Speaker 0: his game ratings and magazines mean so much Yeah.

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,055
Speaker 1: But at the same time like they're in that upper echelon like people were really hesitant to give like the top ratings in case something Better came out the only game that beat it that dethroned.

158
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:12,579
Speaker 1: It was it re-released on CD.

159
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:29,420
Speaker 1: The only complaint we had about these do G packages Is that that re-release not the re re-release and not the original but the middle re-release on CD Was literally the best most perfect iterations of these games ever.

160
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, see people don't realize.

161
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:30,625
Speaker 0: see.

162
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,473
Speaker 0: nowadays when a game comes out.

163
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,188
Speaker 0: There's usually not Versions of the game anymore, right?

164
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,272
Speaker 0: The game gets patched.

165
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,220
Speaker 0: So you're always at the newest version.

166
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:47,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one like counter-strike go, you know one eight and the patch differences aren't usually noticeable other than bug fixes except in fighting games.

167
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,015
Speaker 0: They change the rules and usually there's just DLCs adding stuff to a game.

168
00:11:52,436 --> 00:12:00,000
Speaker 0: You don't get like Complete upgrades of games anymore unless they're old games getting HD remakes, right?

169
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:02,531
Speaker 0: Nintendo be like Wind Waker HD remake.

170
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,760
Speaker 1: but they took tie fire back in the day.

171
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:15,094
Speaker 0: The computer technology was advancing so quickly that even a game that was a year old like doom They just came out with doom again and then doom again again.

172
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:19,872
Speaker 0: It wasn't just like one cop You know, they kept re-releasing it and put making improvements to.

173
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,380
Speaker 0: especially there wasn't really internet then.

174
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, you couldn't download how I got doom.

175
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:34,132
Speaker 1: I was literally at a convention and for a dollar I bought a set of floppy disks that had doom Right, so you could get when they patched a game.

176
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:35,600
Speaker 0: How did they patch the game?

177
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,340
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you could send in to get floppies or something.

178
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,633
Speaker 0: But mostly it's just you didn't get the patch more than I said.

179
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,360
Speaker 0: you went and bought the game again.

180
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:46,636
Speaker 0: You would get a newer version than your friend who bought the game.

181
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:47,380
Speaker 0: a couple months ago.

182
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,930
Speaker 1: I got a floppy disk in the mail once.

183
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,220
Speaker 1: that was a patch to a fantasy empires.

184
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:56,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the copy of doom that I bought I got doom one on CD.

185
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:57,016
Speaker 0: now floppy.

186
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:03,194
Speaker 0: Whoa Young motherfucker had the extra episode CD and had the extra episode.

187
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:07,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got that later, but CD Yeah, well because what happened is originally right?

188
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:12,420
Speaker 0: I got doom one just sort of copied from someone else on floppy.

189
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:18,238
Speaker 0: But then when I bought doom one It was already the extra episode edition with the episode for whatever.

190
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:25,062
Speaker 1: it was One of the first four serious games that I got and played a lot was actually xcom and I didn't know software piracy was A thing.

191
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,556
Speaker 1: a friend of mine was like, oh, yeah, I got a computer too.

192
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:29,086
Speaker 1: It's like a nerd guy I met at Space Camp.

193
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:29,710
Speaker 1: He was like, oh here.

194
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:30,857
Speaker 1: Here's some floppies.

195
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,175
Speaker 1: There's a game You should try it and it was just xcom with no instruction manual.

196
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:39,391
Speaker 1: Yeah Years later, I was like, oh that's a game you could buy in the store for money.

197
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:45,029
Speaker 0: Oh Star control - You needed that chart.

198
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:48,737
Speaker 1: Yeah Quest for glory - you need to that giant map.

199
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:51,190
Speaker 1: Yeah So the CD.

200
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,140
Speaker 1: so they really re-release tie fighter.

201
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:57,135
Speaker 1: They doubled the resolution of the renderer to 640 by 480.

202
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:00,165
Speaker 0: That is a Shit, that's huge.

203
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:00,406
Speaker 0: Fuck.

204
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:08,596
Speaker 0: That's way low res for these days, but it the difference is phenomenal between yeah, and they finish the voice acting.

205
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:13,112
Speaker 0: so Everything has voice acting and the music is the best.

206
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:13,333
Speaker 1: Yep.

207
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,757
Speaker 1: It's still the iMUSE system.

208
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:18,948
Speaker 1: So it's MIDI And it's dynamic like it changes.

209
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,335
Speaker 1: the only game that's done it as well.

210
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:27,384
Speaker 1: Yes as iMUSE was tribes 2 Like no games do it that well there They have like really simple cues.

211
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:34,002
Speaker 1: tribes would like change some of the loops depending on specific things that were going on Nearby.

212
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,688
Speaker 1: you iMUSE did.

213
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,836
Speaker 1: similar things like missiles are coming at you.

214
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:38,960
Speaker 1: the music get more and more intense.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Speaker 1: you feel like you're in Star Wars, so if you Regardless but no, I don't care if you play these games or not get this edition.

216
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,633
Speaker 1: There is literally no reason not to get.

217
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:51,820
Speaker 1: and you have five bucks.

218
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:52,458
Speaker 0: I mean, come on.

219
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:00,446
Speaker 0: Yeah You care about enough about video games that you're listening to this and you care enough about Star Wars because you're a nerd and if you Don't what the hell I can't high five.

220
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:04,763
Speaker 0: and you have five bucks because you can afford a device on which to listen to a Podcast.

221
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,149
Speaker 0: so you've got five bucks.

222
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,560
Speaker 1: buy this high fighter is one of the best games ever.

223
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:09,266
Speaker 0: Is it five bucks?

224
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:09,791
Speaker 0: How much is it?

225
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:10,598
Speaker 1: I don't know how much it is.

226
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:20,808
Speaker 1: It's also like it was the peak of a genre that died almost immediately after it Like it's a genre that is dead.

227
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:25,140
Speaker 1: And yet the peak of that genre is one of the best video games ever made.

228
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,912
Speaker 0: Looking up the price checking the price checking the price.

229
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:35,624
Speaker 1: So while you're checking the price I've been playing a lot of Civ 5 because I've been flying a lot and Modern airplanes.

230
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,229
Speaker 1: usually at least we're flying overseas.

231
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,012
Speaker 1: Just have holes.

232
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,156
Speaker 1: I can just plug my laptop in.

233
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:48,060
Speaker 1: so Kind of want to play Civ against humans and I figured out how to make pit boss go and I figured out all that shit.

234
00:15:48,602 --> 00:16:00,069
Speaker 1: So if you guys want to play a big game of Civ 5 in the coming weeks I'm gonna try to do a few like let's play multiplayer for four hours just so everyone's kind of like getting pumped and getting into it.

235
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:11,099
Speaker 1: and then I'm probably going to start a Big for real pit boss game of Civ 5 and we you know with the may play by mail Like take your turn whatever and we'll just see where it goes.

236
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,592
Speaker 0: GOG's website is really bad on mobile.

237
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:15,898
Speaker 0: It like basically doesn't even work dude.

238
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,920
Speaker 0: I Would pay 40 bucks and there's a fancy new website - that's pretty shameful.

239
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:27,015
Speaker 1: I would pay 40 bucks if that's it's not 40 bucks It's way less than that, but I would pay 40 or 50 bucks for this game today.

240
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:39,620
Speaker 1: I paid like 74 60 at least when I bought it originally there Things of the day.

241
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:52,765
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid in high school in science Olympiad we had there's an event where you had you got points for like making a giant complex Rube Goldberg machine and For many years in a row.

242
00:16:53,046 --> 00:17:05,984
Speaker 1: they changed the rules every year because we meaning my high school and middle school team Would look at the rules find a loophole and pull some like game breaking bullshit Get the first place.

243
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,296
Speaker 1: and then they changed the rules to specifically disallow the thing we did.

244
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:10,460
Speaker 1: like one year.

245
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:11,573
Speaker 0: It's like the TSA.

246
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:23,719
Speaker 1: Yep like originally like one of the rule it was just Every time you transfer between two types of energy and had like these broad categories of energy like chemical mechanical Electromagnetic like all these different things.

247
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:35,540
Speaker 1: So we made a Rube Goldberg machine and timing was the answer would like it had to finish in a precise amount of time Like two minutes and like raise a flag or ring a bell at another point along the way like one minute.

248
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:54,280
Speaker 1: So the first machine we made we made a mechanical clock with a pendulum that Ticked down exactly one minute and then exactly one more minute in parallel to a really fast and super complex Rube Goldberg machine that finished in like 30 seconds and Then just primed the clock to do its one minute and two minute.

249
00:17:54,761 --> 00:18:00,846
Speaker 1: So we didn't have to do any timing for shit and our machine was a series of like 20.

250
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:12,252
Speaker 1: It was an electric motor connected to another electric motor connected to another another electric motor and our scoring chart was electrical to mechanical to electrical to mechanical to electrical to mechanical to electrical.

251
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:12,794
Speaker 1: mechanical.

252
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:20,200
Speaker 1: big old fucking battery at the end and We definitely broke every spirit of those rules to win that first place.

253
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:26,430
Speaker 1: There's a trend that continued year to year to year and when I was in high school Like senior year when I was a little older.

254
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:36,467
Speaker 1: I needed a reaction Where two clear chemicals would interact and become opaque By a like a laser sensor going through.

255
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:36,547
Speaker 0: Yes.

256
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it had to be a chemical reaction.

257
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,948
Speaker 1: It couldn't be turbidity It couldn't be like.

258
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,260
Speaker 1: it had to be a chemical reaction.

259
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,303
Speaker 0: Well, you could always just find like some sort of acid or base and then pour in the stuff that turns pink in an acid Or base.

260
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:51,069
Speaker 1: no because that did so.

261
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,114
Speaker 1: there's a lot of reasons for that.

262
00:18:52,154 --> 00:18:53,740
Speaker 1: It had to turn opaque not translucent.

263
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,920
Speaker 0: This turned sort of dark pink depending how much you know, but it was still translucent.

264
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,104
Speaker 1: It had to be opaque.

265
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,571
Speaker 0: you can have some starchy water and pour in some iodine.

266
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:09,176
Speaker 1: that is not the same kind of reaction Mmm, so what I remember like I was flipping through a chemistry books.

267
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,380
Speaker 1: I never took chemistry in high school.

268
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,659
Speaker 1: I took at the local community college.

269
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:25,280
Speaker 1: So I'm flipping through the high school chemistry book and then I kind of like I noticed the cover and I pull the book cover Off and the cover is a picture of two clear chemicals going into a beaker and turning a bright opaque yellow.

270
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,131
Speaker 1: So I there was no Google really that worked back then.

271
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,720
Speaker 1: so I was like trying to figure out what this reaction was.

272
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:32,727
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure it out.

273
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,760
Speaker 1: I wrote to the publisher like they never responded.

274
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,668
Speaker 1: So I went to the chemistry teacher.

275
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:39,740
Speaker 1: they even the college the college last resort chemistry teacher.

276
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:41,814
Speaker 1: Yes, I go to him because I didn't take chemistry like.

277
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:42,438
Speaker 1: I didn't know him.

278
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:47,175
Speaker 1: So I go to him and I'm like, so what is this reaction?

279
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:50,998
Speaker 1: He's like, I don't know But I'm gonna fucking find out.

280
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:55,040
Speaker 1: So he comes back to me like a month later and he'd figured it out.

281
00:19:55,461 --> 00:20:00,637
Speaker 1: there are two reactions that do that and he couldn't find many other reactions that did it.

282
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:11,688
Speaker 1: and the two reactions are either a cadmium sulfide reaction cadmium sulfide is toxic as shit or a Lead chromate reaction.

283
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,159
Speaker 1: lead chromate is toxic as shit.

284
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:15,426
Speaker 0: It's lead.

285
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:16,149
Speaker 0: It's not know.

286
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,858
Speaker 1: the lead is the least of your worries.

287
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,810
Speaker 1: I'll link to this reaction, but Jesus.

288
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:23,135
Speaker 1: so I was like.

289
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:23,757
Speaker 1: so he's like.

290
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:24,560
Speaker 1: so why do you want to know?

291
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,139
Speaker 1: That's cool.

292
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,761
Speaker 1: and I was like.

293
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:29,030
Speaker 1: I explained that I needed it for the thing and he said oh awesome.

294
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:42,355
Speaker 1: and He gave me a card that I could use to go to the like the lab check out thing and I got all the stuff To do the lead chromate reaction and we totally used it in our thing Despite it being actually like pretty fucking toxic and dangerous.

295
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:47,614
Speaker 1: you drink it No, but you'd like inhaling it getting like it's not something to play around with.

296
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,237
Speaker 1: I'll link to it.

297
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,367
Speaker 1: So We did the thing and it worked.

298
00:20:52,928 --> 00:21:00,340
Speaker 1: and then in the you know in the scoring the guy scoring us says Oh, so that reaction know what is the actual reaction?

299
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:08,108
Speaker 1: So I explained it to him and he says really I say yes, and he says you're disqualified You're not allowed to do something that dangerous here.

300
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,775
Speaker 1: This is like high school science Olympiad.

301
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:10,960
Speaker 1: Like what's wrong with you?

302
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,518
Speaker 1: Where did you even get this stuff?

303
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:18,880
Speaker 1: and My new my thing of the day is that just recently there's been a breakthrough.

304
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,871
Speaker 1: There is a new way to do this reaction.

305
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:27,139
Speaker 1: That is not toxic using bismuth vanadates.

306
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,832
Speaker 0: Okay, this video that sounds less scary.

307
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:34,440
Speaker 1: This video explains the know that involved and it's this guy.

308
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,207

00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,220
Speaker 1: He explains it.

312
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,392
Speaker 1: He's like, it's pretty much not toxic like.

313
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:56,024
Speaker 1: I'm not saying you should eat it But if you had to choose between eating it or lead chromate you want to eat Have the lead chromate Rammel tea, so Anyway, I want.

314
00:21:56,164 --> 00:22:00,340
Speaker 1: I was watching this video and then I remembered like this whole Odyssey of high school Olympiad.

315
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,807
Speaker 1: So I give you this video.

316
00:22:02,887 --> 00:22:03,369
Speaker 1: enjoy it.

317
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,340
Speaker 1: and now you can turn two clear liquids into an opaque yellow pigment.

318
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,619
Speaker 0: Okay without getting cancer or dying or getting disqualified from the science Olympiad, yes.

319
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:14,785
Speaker 1: So you got a thing of the day.

320
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:20,060
Speaker 0: So here is some sort of town city council meeting somewhere, whatever.

321
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:35,245
Speaker 0: It seems like the mayor whoever the person in charge is gets up and goes to the bathroom and it's like the second in charge person She starts discussing but seems to be a legit issue and she's talking about MRSA.

322
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:41,660
Speaker 0: yeah, like, you know Bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and how people they're starting to spread in their neighborhood.

323
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:53,131
Speaker 0: she knows people who are getting MRSA and other, you know, horrible C diff and whatnots and How they're gonna basically say hey federal government, you know They're gonna ask the federal government for money to help with this problem, right?

324
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,940
Speaker 0: Because it's a serious problem and it is and she's right.

325
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:56,248
Speaker 0: so.

326
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,399
Speaker 0: But that's not what the video is about.

327
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:05,060
Speaker 0: The video is about the guy who got up because he didn't need to listen to this part and he went to the bathroom.

328
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, he left his microphone on.

329
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,829
Speaker 1: Oh, just like Homer Simpson.

330
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:11,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's all there is to it.

331
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:16,808
Speaker 1: I Think the best part about it is well She just starts losing it like in the middle of this very.

332
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,419
Speaker 0: she continues discussing her very serious issue, but she that.

333
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:23,210
Speaker 0: Also, it's funny that there's someone who's opposing her.

334
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:24,596
Speaker 0: It's like why would you oppose this?

335
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:25,380
Speaker 0: Do you want people to die?

336
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,046
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

337
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:26,612
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm?

338
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:29,387
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll bet it was Republicans.

339
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:30,472
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

340
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,000
Speaker 0: I don't know which side these people are on.

341
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard to say but I'm small town who gives a shit.

342
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, small town politics the bathroom parts.

343
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,755
Speaker 1: The important part is the only thing worse than big-town politics.

344
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,320
Speaker 0: There's a few people in that meeting.

345
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's sad that there aren't more but at the same time I understand why there aren't more.

00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:55,339
Speaker 1: So people with jobs couldn't go.

350
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:03,634
Speaker 0: I was in the park once and someone comes up to me and is like Usually I'm just like giving them the New York ignore, but they're way pushy.

Speaker 0: you live around here?

354
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:17,500
Speaker 0: And I'm like, no, I live in a story because I was like Greenpoint and they were like if you're lying to me I got to let you know that in that building right now is like a meeting discussing the participatory budgeting.

355
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,244
Speaker 0: You really gotta go.

356
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:21,360
Speaker 1: Oh someone like that grabbed Emily was like, oh you gotta fucking do this.

Speaker 1: And she was again like super scap like, uh-huh, but yeah that thing's legit.

358
00:24:26,557 --> 00:24:27,560
Speaker 0: No, it's it's a real thing.

359
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,877
Speaker 0: That's like I don't have to go and sit in this boring meeting right now in a neighborhood.

00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:31,359
Speaker 0: I don't live in.

361
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:32,611
Speaker 0: Yeah, get away from me.

362
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:36,167
Speaker 0: I told you no And then another person tried to push me.

00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:36,690
Speaker 0: and I'm like.

364
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:40,785

Speaker 1: Yeah I'm just like sprock is he - Of course that can fuck you in some places.

369
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,520
Speaker 0: second person was a lot less pushy though.

370
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,953
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the booklet book is still water ship down.

371
00:24:57,973 --> 00:24:59,200
Speaker 1: It's an epic story of rabbits.

372
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,368
Speaker 1: We don't have any conventions or anything until Connecticut.

373
00:25:02,608 --> 00:25:04,474
Speaker 1: It's nice and chill now and relax.

374
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:09,127
Speaker 0: pegs badges are sold the fuck out So you had about an hour to get them.

375
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:13,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you had about 52 seconds to get good hotels or Saturday badges.

376
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:22,307
Speaker 1: Uh Yeah, and that's pretty much it like follow all our internet shit and now that tell the height of scissor done while it's sunny We're gonna be biking a lot.

377
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:24,280
Speaker 1: There's also gonna be a lot more geek nights content.

378
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,451
Speaker 1: I'm chewing through the backlog of video editing.

379
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,174
Speaker 0: There you go.

380
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:36,840
Speaker 1: So a Secret to win a fortune in games where numbers are foretold Cut with a scissor small slips of paper on each of which you should write a number.

381
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,888
Speaker 1: You should make as many numbers as you wish.

382
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:42,020
Speaker 1: put all of these slips in a large box such that the numbers are facing down.

383
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:46,459
Speaker 1: Take a spider first to trap it in a glass bottle for a half hour then smash it.

384
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:49,252
Speaker 1: Say me he prompts it.

385
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:50,057
Speaker 1: numero per de.

386
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,225
Speaker 1: so What did Kotaku?

387
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:59,842
Speaker 1: Kotaku described this as a mildly satanic video game that you can only play online with real money That's true.

388
00:25:59,922 --> 00:26:05,520
Speaker 0: So Jason Rohrer a person we are a big fan of you may know him from such games as passage passage.

389
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:08,968
Speaker 0: Uh sleep is death which people don't know.

390
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:09,690
Speaker 0: sleep is death.

391
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:22,446
Speaker 0: is this two-player sort of RPG thing where one person Can take any action they want really and then the response is another person manually doing the pixels In response to whatever that person does.

392
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,592
Speaker 0: It's really amazing and overlooked.

393
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:35,126
Speaker 0: diamond trust of London castle doctrine Many other smart dude many other games and his current game that he's working on is cordial minuet Which I have been playing.

394
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:36,393
Speaker 0: we've talked about it before.

395
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:37,600
Speaker 0: we talked about in our pack South.

396
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, I started playing it too.

397
00:26:39,089 --> 00:26:43,754
Speaker 0: We talked about I think a little bit before then But now it is officially released.

398
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:48,399
Speaker 0: a hundred percent Totally and I've been playing it for quite a while on and off.

399
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:54,640
Speaker 0: I have a very high yellow ranking, but I haven't made a lot of money because I don't take risks in big-money games.

400
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,315
Speaker 1: I haven't played it as much but I've been playing when I do play.

401
00:26:57,556 --> 00:27:04,262
Speaker 1: I've been playing one to two orders of magnitude higher stakes than Scott Probably less games.

402
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:07,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been betting ones of dollars.

403
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:11,503
Speaker 0: I've been betting ones of cents and tens of cents a Few times.

404
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:20,714
Speaker 0: one time I played a big dollar game like four or five bucks I lost and another time I played a big game for five bucks I won and I'm around $19 and change and I put in 20 bucks to start.

405
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:25,972
Speaker 0: so I'm down profit wise But my elo ranking is like six or eight plays or something.

406
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,136
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of games.

407
00:27:27,157 --> 00:27:31,676
Speaker 0: They're just so low money They can't make up for my like losing that one one dollar game a long time ago.

408
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:32,298
Speaker 1: I put in 15 bucks.

409
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:39,541
Speaker 0: I'm at like 1380 right now I gotta play some games against rim where he bets like a couple bucks and then I can just get back up into the profit Zone.

410
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:40,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see though.

411
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:41,668
Speaker 1: What if I win right?

412
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,777
Speaker 0: So this game here is basically how this game works.

413
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:59,740
Speaker 0: Imagine if You're playing rock-paper-scissors But the rock-paper-scissors was not equal like rock 140 percent of the time and scissors was 20 percent of the time and paper was the other rest of the right.

414
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:00,985
Speaker 0: But not only that.

415
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,652
Speaker 0: there's a lot more than three choices.

416
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,640
Speaker 0: There's like 12 choices.

417
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:09,481
Speaker 0: Well, there's six choices really but you give one to you and one to your opponent and then you do it again one

418
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:09,701
Speaker 1: two

419
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:23,526
Speaker 0: of the remaining four choices and then the remaining two choices one for you and one for them and wherever the intersections are is the score and is a higher score wins and you bet after every move just like poker and You see who wins.

420
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:26,642
Speaker 0: you get the moneys and That's what this game is.

421
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:33,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a game of perfect skill and Perfect arbitrary like it.

422
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:34,469
Speaker 1: It's just.

423
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 1: it's a game where you Bang your brain against someone else and based on the combined decisions you to make one of you wins a bunch of money.

424
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:46,395
Speaker 1: You have to bet real money to real cash money you.

425
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:47,760
Speaker 0: there is no tutorial.

426
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:50,872
Speaker 0: There is no video that gives you tutorial.

427
00:28:50,972 --> 00:28:52,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, there's no playable you tutorial.

428
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:59,560
Speaker 0: There's a YouTube video tutorial and the way it works is you put real cash money in with your credit card.

429
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:16,320
Speaker 0: It goes into Jason roars bank account where it collects interest to who knows what right and he gives you digital money with which to Play the game which you can withdraw at any time of course into real money again, and then you play the game with the digital real money and When you create a game or join a game these the value of the game is already set.

430
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,080
Speaker 0: So you might see like someone wants to play a 10-cent game you click on it.

431
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,726
Speaker 0: You're now playing a 10-cent game.

432
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:29,799
Speaker 0: or you can say us you can say start a game and you can set the amount of money For the game equal to or less than the amount of money you have in the virtual bank.

433
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:34,420
Speaker 0: No, then both players go into that game with a hundred chips.

434
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,045
Speaker 0: You can leave the game.

435
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:40,239
Speaker 0: if you leave the game early you give the person the ante for the next game.

436
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,718
Speaker 0: Matt You know round you didn't play.

437
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:49,346
Speaker 0: So leaving means losing some amount of chips, but each chip is worth one 200th of the initial pot.

438
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:53,300
Speaker 0: so if you play a $2 game each chip is exactly one cent.

439
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:59,280
Speaker 0: Alright, and after eat the first round you're forced to bet one chip both players.

440
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:03,719
Speaker 0: So even if you both even if you fold immediately you lose that one chip.

441
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:14,020
Speaker 1: so then I pick a row for you and I pick a row for me and Then it reveals the wall row that the other person picked for you But not the row they picked for yourself for themselves, right?

442
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:24,655
Speaker 0: so I pick a row for them and they pick a row for me and And so I see the intersection of the row I picked for myself and the row they picked for me and I know the value that I have.

443
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:27,244
Speaker 0: it's some number on this grid This magic square.

444
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:28,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do it three times.

445
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:32,200
Speaker 1: So you basically you and them each score three boxes, right?

446
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,312
Speaker 0: So, you know which possibilities they have.

447
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:44,580
Speaker 0: it gets narrowed down over time But you're never a hundred percent sure until the very very end What their exact number is and along the way they play?

448
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:56,480
Speaker 0: Well, they can set it up such to where when you look at what possible numbers they could have They could have very high or they could have very low But all your values are sort of stuck in the middle.

449
00:30:56,922 --> 00:31:01,846
Speaker 0: So, you know, so it's like they know whether they're beating you or not But you don't know.

450
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:05,413
Speaker 0: you just know that well 50/50 they're beating me to lose them I don't know.

451
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:13,592
Speaker 1: so in between every one of these after it's revealed how many points you got then you can Blind like simultaneously bet more money.

452
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,220
Speaker 0: So the betting is tricky, right?

453
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,888
Speaker 0: it's not like poker where it goes around.

454
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:22,380
Speaker 0: you bet without knowing what they're betting and Those chips that you bet go in well.

455
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:28,540
Speaker 1: Whoever bid less has to either match right other person bid or fold.

456
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:39,121
Speaker 0: But let's say I bid 10 and you bid 20. right you have an opportunity fold on 20 But I lose those 10 because I didn't get to see that you put in the 20 until my 10 were already taken away from Me.

457
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:46,102
Speaker 0: so now my choice is well put 10 more or fold as opposed to poker where it would be rim would put in 20.

458
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,207
Speaker 0: I would get the information.

459
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,754
Speaker 0: then my turn I fold.

460
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,120
Speaker 0: it's a simultaneous bet.

461
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:58,780
Speaker 1: so if you make it all the way to the end and neither player is folded then the last choice is you choose one of Your score box is to reveal to the other person, right?

462
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,893
Speaker 0: So once you get after that final reveal of that final number, right?

463
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:05,240
Speaker 0: Even though you're not choosing you already know your final score.

464
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,089
Speaker 0: I'm sure I know theirs.

465
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, right that final reveal Sometimes doesn't matter based on the numbers that have been played.

466
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:22,160
Speaker 0: but that final reveal now You know, they're they have one of two possible scores and narrows it down that much before all betting is over.

467
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,880
Speaker 1: I have once or twice gotten someone to not fold and bid a bunch by revealing a surprisingly low number.

468
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:42,524
Speaker 0: Well, if someone reveals a low number, right it can't like it caps their max possible score obviously But you can see plainly if they reveal a low number and they have a high possible score left it's because they were hiding their big numbers.

469
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:43,205
Speaker 0: obviously right.

470
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:54,380
Speaker 0: if they reveal a high number and You look at their possible scores and there's a really low possibility It's like oh they revealed the high number to create this divergent appearance.

471
00:32:54,683 --> 00:33:02,565
Speaker 1: So I get the impression That a lot of people who play this game at least at the very low stakes because there's another clever thing They don't know what's going on.

472
00:33:02,686 --> 00:33:09,470
Speaker 1: The game has a really clever like score description UI element on the right.

473
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:23,940
Speaker 1: that sort of shows all the Mathematically possible numbers that your opponent could think you have that are possible in any fashion and it shows you Every possible score that the opponent could have based on the information you have.

474
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:31,708
Speaker 1: So basically it removes like a reasonable percentage of like the tedious calculation You'd have to do to be good at this.

475
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,620
Speaker 0: There are still some things you have to do though.

476
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,833
Speaker 0: It's like it does so much calculation for you, but there's still more right.

477
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:40,240
Speaker 1: the most boring calculations You can focus on the more interesting, right?

478
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:52,723
Speaker 0: so you can hover over numbers on the grid with your mouse and it will give you information if you know how to read It such as what would the possibilities be if this number will became yours Right.

479
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:57,780
Speaker 0: So it's like well if I got this number my score would be this and my opponent would see these possibilities, right?

480
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:09,232
Speaker 0: so you can sort of see a turn into the future what the possibilities are to help you decide what to pick and It's very very interesting that way because it's actually something people don't realize.

481
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:12,080
Speaker 0: this is like the first basic strategy of the game.

482
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:23,719
Speaker 0: It is possible and in fact it happens in a somewhat surprising percentage of the games I play in fact, I'd say maybe 25% of the rounds at in which before the final pick.

483
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:25,829
Speaker 0: So after the second reveal.

484
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:31,248
Speaker 0: if you look at the grid and study it You can easily figure out within.

485
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:34,356
Speaker 0: I can do it in about 20 seconds at this point, right?

486
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:41,840
Speaker 0: I can figure out Whether or not it is definitely a hundred percent guaranteed that I'll win or lose.

487
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,286
Speaker 0: It's like it's or after the second reveal.

488
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:58,508
Speaker 0: So the third picks haven't even been made but you can at that point oftentimes Determine with this board in this configuration no matter what pick they make and no matter what pick I make in the in the third pick I'm going to lose or I'm going to win no matter what.

489
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:10,057
Speaker 0: and at that point if you make that calculation and figure out it's One of those rounds you can either a fold immediately because you know, you've lost no matter what Yeah, or B just go all-in because they haven't realized it yet.

490
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:15,878
Speaker 0: Most likely Right, and if they know if they're as good as you they were gonna fold right.

491
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:17,325
Speaker 0: then anyway No matter what you bet.

492
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:18,048
Speaker 0: So what's?

493
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,440
Speaker 0: you might as well go all-in instead of 10 or 20?

494
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,226
Speaker 1: That's one thing I've noticed.

495
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,940
Speaker 0: and if they don't know any better Well, I mean, maybe you could have lured them in with a lower bet.

496
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:27,584
Speaker 0: I don't know.

497
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:33,811
Speaker 1: in a higher stakes game if I just go all-in Most of the time my opponent folds very very quickly.

498
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,300
Speaker 0: Well, that's because they got a shitty score, right?

499
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'll go all-in like semi-randomly and people almost always fold.

500
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,338
Speaker 0: Bluffing in this game is huge.

501
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:52,744
Speaker 0: Right because if you can get a bluff win You can get way out ahead of your opponent really fast because if you have the upper hand in chips You are in a very strong position to just take the rest of theirs Regardless of what gets picked.

502
00:35:52,784 --> 00:36:03,560
Speaker 0: right because you can start raising on every round no matter what and if they don't have a good hand It's like they have to fold because if they go for it, they just lose everything they have left.

503
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,047
Speaker 0: They've only got like 20 chips left, right?

504
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,740
Speaker 0: They need to win on like an all-in to get back into the game.

505
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:10,048
Speaker 0: So we get the upper hand in chips.

506
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:18,417
Speaker 0: You can just bully your opponent a lot So that you know gives that kind of strong strategy there regardless of the picking that goes on.

507
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:25,045
Speaker 1: Yeah But in general like just playing this game it's Surprisingly addictive.

508
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:29,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's it gives you that and not because you want to win the real money.

509
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,534
Speaker 0: No, I'm paying for ten cents.

510
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:32,180
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit.

511
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,480
Speaker 1: Game theory game like this.

512
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,549
Speaker 0: There is nothing in my mind that has like a fit.

513
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,790
Speaker 0: like you go into a casino and you pull a slot machine which can be Addictive to even the smartest person and it's like.

514
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:49,260
Speaker 0: but that's because you have in your mind this fantasy of like ooh This jackpot might come out But this time I know there's no fantasy of a jackpot coming out.

515
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,604
Speaker 1: I'm trying to do like a poor man's minimax in my head Like I'm trying to like.

516
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:56,274
Speaker 1: do that, you know, which cup should I some people.

517
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:57,760
Speaker 0: some people use spreadsheets.

518
00:36:58,021 --> 00:37:02,824
Speaker 0: Some people wrote their own client apps even right just like because it's just an open It's you can.

519
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:04,715
Speaker 0: there's no copyright in the code, right?

520
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:05,640
Speaker 0: Everything's on the server.

521
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,388
Speaker 0: It's like you can just write your own client.

522
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,700
Speaker 0: You can just look at the all the source.

523
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,421
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever Jason say we asked him something like packs Like.

524
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:16,156
Speaker 1: does he care if people like try to write bots to solve it with game theory?

525
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:20,517
Speaker 1: There was a lot Yeah, and he's like, yeah, I still make a cut like I don't care go nuts.

526
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:21,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the thing.

527
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,670
Speaker 0: So every round of the game so you go into a game against someone and as long as no one leaves You're playing until one person holds all the remaining chips.

528
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,439
Speaker 0: now each round that you play when the pot pays out Jason roar takes one chip.

529
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:47,500
Speaker 0: So if you takes if you're playing like really going against someone and he goes deep into the game round after round after round And no one's won yet He's taking more and more chips away out of that game and he's happy times.

530
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,880
Speaker 0: He's getting more money's right like imagine if you're playing a big-time game thousands of dollars.

531
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,898
Speaker 0: Each one of those chips is only one two hundredth.

532
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,509
Speaker 0: So if you play a two thousand dollar game.

533
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:08,040
Speaker 0: each chip is like ten bucks But at the same time he's making ten bucks every round and also the ante increases every round.

534
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,165
Speaker 0: So I play against rim.

535
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:09,908
Speaker 0: we play a grid.

536
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:11,474
Speaker 0: right we have to.

537
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,000
Speaker 0: we must ante one chip.

538
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:17,059
Speaker 0: We can obviously go all in right away It doesn't matter but we're putting in at least one chip each.

539
00:38:17,682 --> 00:38:21,395
Speaker 0: Then the next round two then the next three then four then five.

540
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:27,067
Speaker 0: so the deeper you get in You can't play Conservatively because you're basically forced to bet.

541
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:31,600
Speaker 0: like is the 20th round against this guy have to put in 20 chips, right?

542
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:38,376
Speaker 0: So it gets really rough if you're just like if you fall behind a little bit and start playing conservatively just to hold on folding a lot.

543
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,709
Speaker 0: cuz eventually it's Like well, I got I got the one on the first go fold.

544
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:44,775
Speaker 0: I just lost like 20 chips.

545
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:45,397
Speaker 0: Fuck.

546
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:51,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like you have to play aggressively and really go after your opponent no matter how many.

547
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:53,346
Speaker 0: but you've got going on But it's hard to do.

548
00:38:53,386 --> 00:39:03,615
Speaker 0: Like I said before when you have low chips You can't go after someone who's betting a lot because you're basically staking it all in that one game suddenly Whoa, random aside looks like a bull bus exploded.

549
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:07,149
Speaker 1: No It was the way to Boston - it's the one we would usually take.

550
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:08,112
Speaker 0: no look at that.

551
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:09,818
Speaker 1: It literally just exploded.

552
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:12,745
Speaker 0: Wow Bam was people on it.

553
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:14,632
Speaker 1: I think they ran off the bus.

554
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:15,876
Speaker 1: I can't tell what's going on.

555
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:18,815
Speaker 0: Whoa Wow, and I was so safe.

556
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:19,379
Speaker 1: Oh, look at that.

557
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:23,517
Speaker 0: I was having such good times on this safe bolt bus, but maybe you want this to be you.

558
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,632
Speaker 0: Maybe I should stop taking the boat bus Amtrak's not that much more expensive.

559
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:29,600
Speaker 0: That's the first accident bolt buses ever had.

560
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,208
Speaker 1: I think they've had a couple more.

561
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:32,172
Speaker 0: I don't know but that's.

562
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,720
Speaker 1: I was stuck on a bolt bus.

563
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:34,483
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

564
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,410
Speaker 0: it wasn't like a crash accident, right?

565
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:37,816
Speaker 0: It was just the bus.

566
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:38,860
Speaker 0: I thought those are well maintained.

567
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:39,744
Speaker 0: I guess I've been lied.

568
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,415
Speaker 1: I don't think any coach buses are well maintained.

569
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:45,045
Speaker 0: So said ah First comment.

570
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:45,570
Speaker 1: Yeah fun.

571
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,537
Speaker 1: Well still looks bad.

572
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,726
Speaker 1: Anyway, that was an aside.

573
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,080
Speaker 1: that's a New York decide right because we use the bolt bus to go to Pax's.

574
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:58,017
Speaker 0: So now, you know the rim just reads the Internet's while he's doing the show here.

575
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:02,080
Speaker 0: Yeah So there's a lot of other things going on in this game, right?

576
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:12,518
Speaker 0: So the theme of the game is sort of like this dark underground like satanic Like you've been invited into a secret society because you secret gambling day, you know things.

577
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:15,926
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean like we talked about in our pack show.

578
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:20,580
Speaker 1: his booth at Pax was like this gypsy like mystery gambling day.

579
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:21,348
Speaker 0: That's a racist word.

580
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:21,591
Speaker 0: racist.

581
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:24,629
Speaker 1: Look like a gypsy cap.

582
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,194
Speaker 1: It was cool.

583
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:25,980
Speaker 0: Gypsy's a race.

584
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:33,580
Speaker 1: It should be like a Romani time Yeah, but I don't want to impose this satanic gambling game upon the actual Romani people.

585
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:35,430
Speaker 0: That's why but it's just.

586
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:42,440
Speaker 0: the tent was in their stylings But it was actually a tent in the style of the fortune teller from Laura linked to the past.

587
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:51,338
Speaker 1: But inside it was like this cyberpunk dystopia with these like raw Lzd monitors with like ribbon cables coming out of them to play the game on.

588
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:56,180
Speaker 0: Yep This is the style of the game accounts for live is the boring like minesweeper grid?

589
00:40:56,642 --> 00:40:57,970
Speaker 0: You wouldn't really be wanting to play this.

590
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:05,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, the games like it had and you know, he's made You know the gong that we do a lot of lectures about like game design and UX and all these things.

591
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:12,260
Speaker 1: Jason Rohrer is one of the few people on earth where I have really nothing bad at all to say about any of his works

592
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:19,030
Speaker 0: And all his works are like completely new and ingenious and fresh But like any other thing that came before that all the

593
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:24,053
Speaker 1: things that I make tired complaints about with other games Like he's got that shit down flawlessly like

594
00:41:24,535 --> 00:41:24,917
Speaker 0: simple

595
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:25,500
Speaker 1: little things.

596
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,840
Speaker 1: Like he uses the metaphor of like paper in the game, right?

597
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,513
Speaker 1: Like it's a piece of parchment and you put ink on it.

598
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:39,700
Speaker 1: like green ink shows the air Like the place you took and red ink shows the other persons and the ink never goes away.

599
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,144
Speaker 1: Like it doesn't preview.

600
00:41:41,224 --> 00:41:45,615
Speaker 1: showing you ink when you're making your decision you move a marker outside the board.

601
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:47,680
Speaker 1: ink is permanent on the paper.

602
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:50,509
Speaker 1: Yep little things like that.

603
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:57,033
Speaker 1: the UI and the UX are so Consistent and just so well thought out in these very nuanced ways.

604
00:41:57,394 --> 00:41:59,180
Speaker 0: So let's talk about some basic strategies.

605
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:06,761
Speaker 0: So the most basic strategy there is is to give your opponent the row that has the lowest possible Number.

606
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,268
Speaker 0: basically keep their score down, right?

607
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,433
Speaker 0: So, you know the maximum score they could have.

608
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:14,040
Speaker 0: meanwhile pick for yourself either.

609
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,019
Speaker 0: You can figure out your opponent's behavior and therefore, you know They're gonna pick the shittiest row for you.

610
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,807
Speaker 0: So pick the highest number of the shitty thing.

611
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:24,739
Speaker 1: you already went one step beyond your first heuristic, right?

612
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:24,799
Speaker 0: or?

613
00:42:26,341 --> 00:42:28,351
Speaker 0: Just pick a row with high variance.

614
00:42:28,732 --> 00:42:33,953
Speaker 0: if you pick a row with high variance You're mathematically speaking because all the rows and columns add up to the same number.

615
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:34,997
Speaker 0: It's a magic square, right?

616
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:42,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so You can sort of pick a row with high variance and it's like you might get a really low score.

617
00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:48,120
Speaker 0: You might get a really high score, but your opponent sees both possibilities because you picked a row with high variance.

618
00:42:48,863 --> 00:42:52,500
Speaker 0: So the result of that is you're keeping your opponent's score down.

619
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,751
Speaker 0: So they don't have a big number to be confident with that.

620
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:56,554
Speaker 0: They're gonna beat you.

621
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:01,991
Speaker 0: and when they look at your possibilities It's like well could be big could be small.

622
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,020
Speaker 0: You might have six you might have a hundred.

623
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:06,299
Speaker 0: They don't freaking know right?

624
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,556
Speaker 0: it's like sort of a coin toss for them which makes them nervous.

625
00:43:09,576 --> 00:43:12,266
Speaker 0: and Then you can convince them with your betting.

626
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:23,424
Speaker 0: if you are being contained by your opponent sort of into this middle-of-the-road score It's like well you might win with that if they were really if you can force them into a really shitty score But you don't have the.

627
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:27,560
Speaker 0: how do you have the confidence to bet when they could have a really high score and they're betting big?

628
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:29,306
Speaker 0: It's like oh, what do you do?

629
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:32,557
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's the most basic of strategies.

630
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:33,600
Speaker 0: There are other strategies.

631
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:42,340
Speaker 0: For example, let's say you see a row and that row has like 36 and 34 and it like these two big numbers like those are 36 is the biggest number on the grid, right?

632
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,244
Speaker 0: It's a six by six grid one to 36.

633
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:47,781
Speaker 0: You don't want them to get the 36.

634
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:51,280
Speaker 0: They're probably gonna win with that unless you give them two really crappy numbers to go with it.

635
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:59,120
Speaker 0: But because it has the 36 and another over 30 number that row the rest of the numbers are gonna be really shitty.

636
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:10,982
Speaker 0: So it's like well if they pick this row, you know I'd give them this row if they pick randomly they have a four out of six chance of getting something really really shitty Right.

637
00:44:11,744 --> 00:44:19,049
Speaker 0: So I'll give them that and maybe they'll get lucky and get the one of the two that are over 30 But most likely four out of six chance.

638
00:44:19,069 --> 00:44:20,453
Speaker 0: They're gonna get a really bad number.

639
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:25,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if they're stuck with that well You know, I'm probably gonna.

640
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,399
Speaker 0: they're breaking a fold right away.

641
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:28,692
Speaker 0: No If I bet a little bit or who knows where right.

642
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:41,980
Speaker 0: so you can give them that kind of row Bet and if they see you or they bet also you can be pretty sure they got one of those 30s unless they're really really smart Betting it up when they've got a shitty number course.

643
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,943
Speaker 1: Then you use that.

644
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:49,200
Speaker 1: if you assume that they got like the 30 then you know that they can't use that row again.

645
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,153
Speaker 1: Yeah in the next two rounds Dale.

646
00:44:52,374 --> 00:44:53,480
Speaker 0: So you they pick a row.

647
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:56,960
Speaker 0: They've eliminated all these other possibilities from the game.

648
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:00,696
Speaker 0: So, you know you give them this row and the good number in that row is 36, right?

649
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,541
Speaker 0: And they let's say you're pretty sure they got the 36.

650
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:12,069
Speaker 0: Well, if you're pretty sure about that then you know that in this these other numbers across the board They can't get those on the second pick.

651
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,661
Speaker 0: and you see that they've eliminated by picking the 36.

652
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:18,360
Speaker 0: They've eliminated like the 28 from this other choice.

653
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:24,579
Speaker 0: It's like well I'll give you that row that no longer has a 28 in it because the rest of the numbers in aren't that great.

654
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:27,411
Speaker 0: And then they also they give you a row.

655
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:32,200
Speaker 0: so they give you a row and now it's like well They gave me that row which means they didn't take it for themselves.

656
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:36,756
Speaker 0: So they can't possibly have any of those numbers and they've eliminated the 30 from that one.

657
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,739
Speaker 0: So I'll give them that one that no longer has a 30 in it and has a really shitty numbers remaining.

658
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:52,235
Speaker 1: Now I found that a lot of one of the strategies I use in low stakes games It seems highly effective is I kind of assume my opponent's dumb and has a pretty simple strategy.

659
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,603
Speaker 1: So I move quickly and The first round I assume that they're gonna do something dumb Like they.

660
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:03,440
Speaker 1: they're going for the 36, you know, these look really like there's like the really simplest heuristics baby mode.

661
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:10,079
Speaker 1: so assuming someone's dumb and doing that I Maximize the harm to them by making that choice.

662
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:21,055
Speaker 1: and then it's immediately obvious if that works in the first round then I play super Aggressively and super fast and bit a lot and I just kind of bowl them over and win

663
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:31,227
Speaker 0: a lot of the game is Figuring out because if you just try to play randomly rock-paper-scissors wise right that is not going to work Right in rock-paper-scissors.

664
00:46:31,267 --> 00:46:32,291
Speaker 0: You want to play randomly?

665
00:46:32,351 --> 00:46:32,612
Speaker 0: Why?

666
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:34,620
Speaker 0: because all three choices are equally power.

667
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:37,700
Speaker 1: You do still want to play randomly, but you want to play with a mixed strategy.

668
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,300
Speaker 0: You want to play like not all strategies in this game are equally powerful, right?

669
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,090
Speaker 0: There's a really strong rock and sort of a weaker scissor and a ball.

670
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,956
Speaker 1: choices are not even so what you.

671
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:49,806
Speaker 1: so a mixed strategy would be.

672
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:59,199
Speaker 1: like 60% of the time I'm going to you know not choose the row with the 36 because reasons I'm gonna use this other kind of row in my first pick.

673
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:05,338
Speaker 1: Yeah Or like 20% of the time I'll choose a low variance row in the first round because the board is different.

674
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:08,347
Speaker 0: the actual Variance numbers change round to round.

675
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:12,439
Speaker 0: that is sometimes boards are just unfavorable to one or the other player.

676
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:13,604
Speaker 0: But you can.

677
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:21,254
Speaker 0: sometimes you can look at a board from turn one and be like, oh wow I can just totally corral them in no matter what they pick right.

678
00:47:21,314 --> 00:47:24,007
Speaker 0: It's like in order for them to beat these picks They would have to make that pick.

679
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,040
Speaker 0: but then picks two and three they're hosed.

680
00:47:26,462 --> 00:47:28,591
Speaker 0: So and if they don't pick that on turn one, they're hosed.

681
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:30,480
Speaker 0: Anyway, this board is just good for me.

682
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:32,300
Speaker 0: I'll just bet it way up on the first pick.

683
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:38,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, like sometimes what I'll do is if there's a row that has very little variance is all like middle-of-the-road numbers.

684
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,159
Speaker 1: Sometimes what I'll do is I'll give that to myself on the first round because they can't basically like they can't

685
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,473
Speaker 0: hurt me Hose you out on the first round

686
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:57,427
Speaker 1: and then the Choices like making my choice and doing my calculation of the next two rounds super easy at that point because I have there's so few decisions left to make.

687
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:09,179
Speaker 1: so I can think of it in terms of Two row choices high score low score like these positions and I can sort of based on their behavior figure out like oh They tend to when they're behind do this kind of thing.

688
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all about you know, figuring because your opponent is always a human being right?

689
00:48:14,903 --> 00:48:16,840
Speaker 0: They have some sort of logic.

690
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,349
Speaker 0: You can always also think what would I do if I were them?

691
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:26,644
Speaker 0: and there's there are situations where it's not just poison cup because the math Unbalances the poison cup.

692
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:31,460
Speaker 0: It's like wow, they would be stupid to make this pick because they just lose if they make that pick.

693
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,100
Speaker 0: So really they're only making one of these two choices.

694
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:39,676
Speaker 0: Which one would I make if I was them based on their past behavior in previous rounds?

695
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:40,860
Speaker 0: Which one are they likely to pick?

696
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:46,040
Speaker 0: Oh, look if I pick this row that's kind of hoses them on either of those two choices.

697
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:54,639
Speaker 0: I have to pick that one and I'll get this one and then it usually turns out that you're right and You'll see that the other players can also do this to you.

698
00:48:55,041 --> 00:49:04,213
Speaker 0: You'll often see like in the last round, you know when there's only like two, you know There's only like two numbers two columns left because there's only two things to pick.

699
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,980
Speaker 0: you'll see like there'll be one row.

700
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:10,840
Speaker 0: But there's only two shitty numbers available and it's like they're gonna give me that one, aren't they?

701
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:20,360
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get a shitty number now no matter what right right and yes Nine times out of ten that shitty row that only had two shitty numbers left goes to you and it didn't matter what you pick.

702
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:29,340
Speaker 0: However, if they don't do that like if they do well The only way they wouldn't do that is if that had given themselves that row already in one of the earlier two picks.

703
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:31,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if they're a good player They haven't.

704
00:49:31,842 --> 00:49:32,344
Speaker 0: they knew.

705
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:33,368
Speaker 0: that's how it was gonna work.

706
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:39,288
Speaker 0: and those other two numbers that you've taken in that row They know those are already beneath what I was getting.

707
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:41,817
Speaker 1: that I can tell it makes like an obviously dumb decision.

708
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:45,159
Speaker 1: more than once They're a keeper and I saw I'm playing this game to the end.

709
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:49,700
Speaker 0: It's all about figuring out your opponent's behavior in those early rounds.

710
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,628
Speaker 0: It's always full advantage.

711
00:49:51,648 --> 00:49:53,135
Speaker 1: smart in the early round no matter

712
00:49:53,175 --> 00:50:08,060
Speaker 0: how smart you are There is some pattern to your behavior in some strategy because if you don't have any kind of strategy if you play Super randomly you will just lose to someone who plays sort of the greatest win percentage chance rose.

713
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:17,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you there's you can just play the best chance of winning rose Against a random bot and you will come out on top like money-wise 60% or something like that.

714
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:19,228
Speaker 0: So you cannot just play randomly.

715
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,975
Speaker 0: you have to have some sort of.

716
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:26,159
Speaker 0: you have to at least Play best odds of winning choices if no other kind of choice.

717
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:31,900
Speaker 0: But if you play best odds of winning and your opponent knows you always play best odds of winning they can just destroy you.

718
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:38,150
Speaker 0: You have to mix it up and therefore it forces you to do Poison cup with math.

719
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,034
Speaker 0: add it on to it.

720
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,360
Speaker 0: Not just straight poison cup.

721
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:46,619
Speaker 1: So it's super fun and you should probably put just not mean think put like five bucks in.

722
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,791
Speaker 0: There's no reason to spend a lot of money.

723
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:49,920
Speaker 0: You can play penny games.

724
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:57,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, right think think of that five bucks as that's what you paid for the game, right and just don't lose all your money And just try it out.

725
00:50:58,087 --> 00:50:59,753
Speaker 0: It's if you have problems with gambling.

726
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:01,078
Speaker 0: There are places you can call for that.

727
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:02,724
Speaker 0: It's an Interesting like.

728
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:03,728
Speaker 0: it's not a variance.

729
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,299
Speaker 1: There aren't other games like it?

730
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:14,153
Speaker 1: No that's for sure and I'm curious if anyone is going to put any like Game theory math behind it to try to come up with an optimal play strategy.

731
00:51:14,293 --> 00:51:16,200
Speaker 0: Also, it's really I just came out now.

732
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,119
Speaker 0: It's hot now.

733
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,545
Speaker 0: There's like a launch contest.

734
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:18,986
Speaker 0: now.

735
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:24,946
Speaker 0: if you're gonna play it play it now because this is the kind of game that could easily not Have any players after some amount of time.

736
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:26,129
Speaker 1: also, you know poker.

737
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:34,520
Speaker 1: if poker gets really popular like one month because there's a big thing On TV, that's when you want to play a bunch of poker because a whole bunch of noobs are playing poker.

738
00:51:34,823 --> 00:51:36,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna get some money out of them.

739
00:51:36,581 --> 00:51:41,700
Speaker 1: You don't want to play poker when the only people in the room are all wearing sunglasses and are obviously poker pros.

740
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:42,847
Speaker 1: Just just leave.

742
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:48,319
Speaker 0: You need to go there if you're playing it more than just once to see what it is.

746
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:20,600
Speaker 1: and in a closing note blood-stained ritual of the night raised 70,000 more dollars since we mentioned it on the show earlier, you know, I've been watching this tally count up.

747
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:27,080
Speaker 0: I mean people pay a lot of money just for an original copy of Symphony of the Night on a disc.

748
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:30,500
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't they pay 28 bucks for a digital copy of modern?

749
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:38,194
Speaker 0: Probably a lot of people as good game at high levels - well, you know, they really like.

750
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:40,000
Speaker 1: I mean eight people gave him two grand.

Speaker 0: What do you get for two grand?

752
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:42,391
Speaker 1: What do you get for two?

753
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:44,260
Speaker 1: for two grand you get the game?

754
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,849
Speaker 0: I hope runic forging.

755
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:47,799
Speaker 1: I guess that's the name of that thing.

756
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:51,413
Speaker 1: Okay, collaborate with the development team to create an in-game weapon.

757
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:52,677
Speaker 1: All right, that's cool.

758
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:53,420
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

759
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:56,120
Speaker 1: I would make some like bullshit little stabby dagger.

760
00:52:58,046 --> 00:53:04,900
Speaker 0: I would make See what like throwing weapons because they don't get used enough, but I'd make it throwing up and it's actually used a lot.

761
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:19,180
Speaker 1: Well, like in Dawn of Sorrow my my go-to as soon as I got all the good weapons I'd always have cuz you know the two hands I'd have the slowest Most fucking damage like the giant axe and my other weapon is the fastest weakest weapon.

762
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:19,361
Speaker 0: You know.

763
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:30,340
Speaker 0: what I would do is I would make a bow and arrow or crossbow that could actually be fired rapidly in all eight Directions, but was only mid was strong enough to matter but not ridiculously strong.

764
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:33,820
Speaker 0: So you'd be better off using an unwieldy weapon for just damage.

765
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:46,100
Speaker 0: So but it would really be good to use in a lot of those rooms or bad guys come from all sorts of directions if you have skills because you can Actually hit them as opposed to trying to like dodge out of the way so you could hit him with your clumsy sword.

766
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:48,407
Speaker 0: That's what I would do like a metal blade basically.

767
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,052
Speaker 1: Yeah, you and your metal blade.

768
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:51,316
Speaker 1: metal blade was way OP.

769
00:53:51,336 --> 00:53:52,440
Speaker 0: That's the point.

770
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:56,320
Speaker 0: Yeah less powerful than metal blade though, but still with the directions and the control.

771
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:04,670
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
