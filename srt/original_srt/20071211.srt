1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,227
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday December 11th.

2
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:12,049
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,020
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:25,369
Speaker 1: worms to open warfare or worms open warfare - Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,729
Speaker 1: Well, I'll be brief about this since I assume any new listeners at least tried to listen to yesterday.

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:42,229
Speaker 1: But just in case if you're looking for our New York anime festival coverage You'll probably want to listen tomorrow Wednesday night, which is the night we talk about anime and manga and all that stuff.

7
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:45,761
Speaker 0: Yep, and hence since it was an anime convention technically.

8
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:48,230
Speaker 0: I think it actually was primarily an anime convention.

9
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:50,270
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about it on Wednesday.

10
00:00:50,601 --> 00:01:06,200
Speaker 1: however We can talk a little bit about what gaming there was to be had at the New York anime festival since we usually after a Con will always do like the Tuesday after the con We'll talk about the game and going on there because you know Otakon has their crazy gaming room and katsu kon has the best Gaming room of any con ever and packs.

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,299
Speaker 1: Well, we haven't been to yet, but I can only imagine Gaming paradise I did if I'm to be believed.

12
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,307
Speaker 1: if if I if you are to be believed.

13
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:21,490
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly Alright, so at the New York anime festival, there was some gaming going on.

14
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,590
Speaker 0: I mean there were some gaming events like the video game magic.

15
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:32,902
Speaker 1: Well first off next door to the New York anime festival in what I can only assume was a startling coincidence the world championship of magic.

16
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,289
Speaker 1: the gathering was that money the wasting.

17
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:37,483
Speaker 1: and It's funny, you know you walk into the con.

18
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:42,724
Speaker 1: there's this giant Seraph angel statue like wow, is that for the anime con?

19
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:44,670
Speaker 1: Oh, it's for the magic tournament.

20
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even realize.

21
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:49,170
Speaker 0: and that was apparently the world championship of magic.

22
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went in there and it wasn't very crowded.

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,226
Speaker 0: It was pretty crowded crowded, but it wasn't as crowded as you would imagine.

24
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:56,190
Speaker 1: When did you go in there?

25
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,490
Speaker 0: Oh only I only went down there like when I first got you know before you even there.

26
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:01,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was going on later.

27
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:02,480
Speaker 1: I walked in.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,867
Speaker 1: it was pretty mighty crowded.

29
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:04,490
Speaker 0: All right.

30
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:06,538
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah money the wasting.

31
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,750
Speaker 0: so in the New York anime festival the gaming situation.

32
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:15,390
Speaker 0: Well, first off there were a few dealers selling of course the gaming merchandise and the imported game stuff.

33
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:18,768
Speaker 0: You know typical what you have at every other anime con in the Northeast.

34
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:28,059
Speaker 1: though Now that Emily has the DS I think the DS import games are of much more interest to us as a crew at least to her because she can read the Japanese Yeah, and she can go on man.

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,490
Speaker 1: You guys don't know what you're missing, you know.

36
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:40,365
Speaker 0: And even though there's a whole bunch of games which don't really require You know much reading of Japanese and the DS is region-free I'm generally disinterested in those games because of the exorbitant price you must pay to obtain them.

37
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,317
Speaker 0: Oh, but roms anyway I don't do that.

38
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:43,638
Speaker 0: Okay.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,503
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.

40
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,609
Speaker 1: You just don't have a card.

41
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,766
Speaker 1: yet You wait every day for a card to come out.

42
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:48,230
Speaker 1: that'll do that.

43
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,730
Speaker 0: It supposedly is a card and there's funny things to say about how people are selling that card.

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,328
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna talk about that now because I have to spend 10 minutes finding the link again.

45
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:03,710
Speaker 0: All right Anyway, anyway So the first thing that was notable about this the gaming at the con was it was like Devil May Cry 4.

46
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,463
Speaker 0: OMG now I played Devil May Cry 1 for what the ps2 I think right?

47
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:08,764
Speaker 0: Yeah.

48
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, we played that at the capstone.

49
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played that in college basically when it first came out on someone else's.

50
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:16,543
Speaker 1: now I remember we all went over there and you know, they're like check it out.

51
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:21,670
Speaker 1: I got Devil May Cry and For like a much hyped game for like a half hour.

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,430
Speaker 1: That was the best game I'd ever played because I jump up and then in slow motion while falling back down.

53
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,754
Speaker 1: I would shoot at a skeleton.

54
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,041
Speaker 0: It wasn't so much that he fell down in slow motion.

55
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:39,770
Speaker 0: It's that he didn't really slow down time It's just he fell really slowly like he could sort of levitate in the air and would fall to the ground.

56
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:47,600
Speaker 0: It would take him like like you jump up high Instantly and then it would take him like a good 30 seconds before he landed on the ground again.

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,825
Speaker 0: as long as you held down the jump.

58
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:52,510
Speaker 0: it was really cool Yeah, and you could shoot while you're up in the air.

59
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,422
Speaker 0: So I jump up in the air where a bad guy couldn't hit me and then shoot you Until the bad guy died.

60
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,370
Speaker 0: and those fun times.

61
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:03,070
Speaker 1: I didn't really play the game beyond that so I can't speak as to its quality.

62
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:10,270
Speaker 0: I think I played like the first half of a level maybe and then I got tired of it because it Was the same thing over and over again, and it was kind of easy.

63
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:14,249
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it gets harder later, but I was done with it at that point.

64
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:15,858
Speaker 1: Well, you know we were in college.

65
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:17,346
Speaker 1: We had to go play some D&D instead.

66
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:27,190
Speaker 0: exactly So Devil May Cry 4 which I am pretty sure in fact I'm a hundred percent sure it is not a game you can currently purchase anywhere was playable at the New York Anime Festival.

67
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:33,930
Speaker 0: You had to wait in line and go in this little booth And then you could play out in one of their little TVs there that you know and it was surrounded with a black curtain.

68
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,430
Speaker 0: so You couldn't like get you know screenshots or photos or anything.

69
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:42,050
Speaker 0: I didn't go in and play it because I really didn't care But other people went and played it and they said it wasn't bad.

70
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:43,094
Speaker 0: They kind of liked it.

71
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,139
Speaker 0: You know we probably could have.

72
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,610
Speaker 1: we had those like solid gold professional badges.

73
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:50,148
Speaker 1: We probably just gotten right to the front of the line, but I had no desire to do so.

74
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,024
Speaker 0: Like it's like if you want you know sure playing a game.

75
00:04:55,104 --> 00:05:01,710
Speaker 0: You know before its release is pretty cool But I have to want to play it or yet to give me some incentive.

76
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:04,190
Speaker 0: I just really didn't care about Devil May Cry at all.

77
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:11,022
Speaker 0: But anyway, there was also a video game room Which was one of the saddest video game rooms ever.

78
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:16,639
Speaker 0: the video game room was being run by New York Tokyo the people who ran the New York Tokyo music festival.

79
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,163
Speaker 1: Did we ever do a show about that?

80
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:19,046
Speaker 0: I don't know.

81
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:24,330
Speaker 1: maybe cuz that was Kind of awesome, but at the same time it was also kind of a bait-and-switch.

82
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:33,041
Speaker 1: And it was like come see all this awesome j-pop Oh my god Japanese music, and then we got there, and we got to see you know boa Do a small set.

83
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:33,790
Speaker 1: that was awesome.

84
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:40,710
Speaker 1: Then we got to see some other like j-pop artists do something and then it turned into like this four hour long boring techno party.

85
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:46,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we had to sleep on the streets of New York City only because we didn't get back to the train station.

86
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,036
Speaker 1: Cuz we sucked.

87
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:47,782
Speaker 0: cuz we sucked.

88
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:48,889
Speaker 0: we don't suck anymore.

89
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:56,870
Speaker 0: We'll never make a mistake like that again, but regardless this video game room right it had a few good things and mostly bad things.

90
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:57,132
Speaker 0: Right.

91
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,834
Speaker 0: first of all it was really really tiny Incredibly tiny.

92
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:08,767
Speaker 0: and for a con where at least on Saturday where it was crazy crowded The the video game room in proportion was not large enough at all.

93
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,416
Speaker 0: I mean Really damn.

94
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:11,919
Speaker 0: was it small.

95
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,227
Speaker 1: I think it was helps my bedroom.

96
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:17,387
Speaker 1: I think it was helped by the fact it was literally smaller than my bedroom.

97
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:24,030
Speaker 1: yes But I think what really hurt it or helped it was that I don't think most people at the con knew it was there.

98
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,681
Speaker 0: Well, it was hidden in like the back hallway.

99
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,084
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

100
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:26,930
Speaker 1: there was a bunch of stuff.

101
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,370
Speaker 1: There was a Japanese art like kimono exhibit.

102
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's where the art show was.

103
00:06:31,702 --> 00:06:33,010
Speaker 0: wasn't the art show also in there?

104
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:33,689
Speaker 1: I don't know.

105
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,537
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter cuz I didn't even know that kimono exhibit was there And I never went to it.

106
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,086
Speaker 1: I went over to what I peeked in.

107
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:39,650
Speaker 1: I had a drinks.

108
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,870
Speaker 1: They wouldn't let me in I didn't come back later.

109
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,309
Speaker 0: I only found out about it today when I was looking at the map of the con.

110
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:47,410
Speaker 0: That was sitting in the living room And

111
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,817
Speaker 1: there was the I think manga library or something a

112
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:56,039
Speaker 0: manga library which I've gone through before which is pretty much the best And I think the first manga library,

113
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:01,190
Speaker 1: but yeah, I think it worked out because honestly I mean I even I heard a kid as we were leaving the con on Sundays.

114
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,184
Speaker 1: We was walking out, and he saw the video game room, and he said oh, man.

115
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:05,230
Speaker 1: There's video games here.

116
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much That's that was.

117
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,160
Speaker 0: you put him in a back hallway like but

118
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:18,020
Speaker 1: at the same time if it was such a small room that was Probably for the best because there was never really a line to get in and you could just walk in and they're Reasonably short amount of time play a game.

119
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:27,650
Speaker 0: I heard from people that it was smelly on Friday But it was not smelly on Saturday or Sunday I guess I went in once just to look around with with anonymous from Apple geeks.

120
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:42,670
Speaker 0: We looked around and then we walked out and basically what was going on in there is they didn't have a good Selection of games and some of the good things they had were in the middle of the room were two tables and they had DS Is like tied down to the tables of games in them so you could play like that and that was pretty cool.

121
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:48,222
Speaker 0: They had a cooking mama They had cooked and signs above each television saying which game it was.

122
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:48,844
Speaker 0: you didn't need to like.

123
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:51,051
Speaker 0: go over and look real closely at Each one.

124
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,135
Speaker 0: you just kind of look around the room.

125
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:56,210
Speaker 1: I get the impression that it was super high quality.

126
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,437
Speaker 1: It was just too small.

127
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:04,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was very few games You know and on one wall, they had a projector where they were doing all tournaments and such.

128
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,901
Speaker 0: I forget what do they think they were doing?

129
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,350
Speaker 0: a guilty gear something when I was in.

130
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,110
Speaker 1: Well when I walked in there were three projectors pointed at that wall.

131
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:10,855
Speaker 0: No, there was only.

132
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:14,829
Speaker 0: I think there may have been three pointed at the wall But I think only one was on taking up.

133
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:22,190
Speaker 1: I think it speaks well of Nintendo that to this day probably the most popular game in that room was Smash Brothers melee.

134
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:24,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's gonna change in a couple months.

135
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:38,269
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway The one thing that I noticed that was especially high quality about the the room there was that there was a guy who was sort Of emceeing the tournaments and he was quite skilled in the ways of the emcee.

136
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:41,361
Speaker 1: Isn't that what we offered to do at Katsu khan last year and then just didn't?

137
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:47,030
Speaker 0: yeah, I think he's sort of like a. You know, I guess New York Tokyo must have people with that kind of talent.

138
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that seems like the kind of thing they would have.

139
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,964
Speaker 1: Let's make sure Katsu khan has that going this year.

140
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:52,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of need it.

141
00:08:53,311 --> 00:09:03,183
Speaker 0: But anyway, other than that, it was just a tiny little game room with a good assortment of games ranging from you know The hardcore to the not hardcore the DS to the 360 to the ps3 and the Wii

142
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,470
Speaker 1: and Smash Brothers to cooking mama - yep

143
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:11,017
Speaker 0: And it was there and I guess it was good at getting like, you know Maybe 50 people could have been.

144
00:09:11,037 --> 00:09:13,550
Speaker 0: I got to say when I walked in there people would have been a crowd.

145
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,092
Speaker 0: So, you know it kept a handful of people out of the rest of the con It had.

146
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:18,779
Speaker 1: they had a trauma center - in there.

147
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,550
Speaker 1: and I'm just walking around the own trauma center.

148
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,890
Speaker 1: No, but I see a kid and he picks it up and he's playing through some surgery.

149
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,674
Speaker 1: I don't know which one it was.

150
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:26,539
Speaker 1: I haven't played the game yet.

151
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:31,790
Speaker 1: But uh, I This was inexplicably and unexpectedly hilarious.

152
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:43,750
Speaker 1: so he starts playing right and dogs like do this do this to this and Then he like he looks around and then he just starts slashing Wildly with everything he can until the patient died as fast as possible that he laughed and walked away.

153
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:45,699
Speaker 0: He just took the scalpel away cutty cutty cutty.

154
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:46,643
Speaker 1: It was like.

155
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:47,667
Speaker 1: so he was careful.

156
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:54,005
Speaker 1: He was like think think think think And then he walked away going he after the guy died.

157
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,294
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, it's a kid.

158
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:57,761
Speaker 1: I was just I was on.

159
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:00,237
Speaker 1: it was a little kid - he was like 14.

160
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,209
Speaker 0: What is this world coming to?

161
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,102
Speaker 1: Well when a 14 year old doctor murders a patient in a in a video game.

162
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:11,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many Sims or Simoleons have you murdered in the course of your life?

163
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,197
Speaker 0: Not on purpose.

164
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:20,311
Speaker 1: Oh, ah You bulldoze more than one church or school to make more high-density residential blocks Maybe.

165
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:24,830
Speaker 0: but I've also summoned Godzilla only to get only so that I could get rid of him with my soldiers.

166
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:33,289
Speaker 1: You have also sent that one lone Horseman around the world only to die lonely and afraid in the Arctic wastes as you were trying to make your way to some other continent.

167
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:42,486
Speaker 0: No Anyway, that reminds me of that video where they they keep making the soldier walk into the wall.

168
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:43,370
Speaker 1: That was a good video.

169
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,401
Speaker 1: I think it was the thing of the day.

170
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:52,280
Speaker 1: I think it was So in the news speaking of soldiers That game that I waited 10 years for and then promptly got sick of.

171
00:10:52,661 --> 00:11:01,059
Speaker 1: well game was a team fortress - alright that one well valve collects Inordinate amounts of statistics from their game.

172
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:04,330
Speaker 0: Well, I think what they did is they learned from doing their valve survey.

173
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,270
Speaker 0: You know were they the hardware so that people really like to see statistics.

174
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:10,510
Speaker 0: No, no that they make a lot of money from that survey.

175
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,865
Speaker 0: Like they have companies calling them up and asking them, you know, we you know, who's using?

176
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,210
Speaker 0: are they using more invidious more?

177
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:26,807
Speaker 0: ATIs, you know is this and that is this a popular thing is and that's valuable data to collect and because of their steam platform They're pretty much the only ones who can collect it, you know, I know why.

178
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:27,550
Speaker 0: cuz I mean think about it.

179
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,098
Speaker 0: Let's say someone like I don't know.

180
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:31,309
Speaker 0: What's a recent popular PC game?

181
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,830
Speaker 1: Well, you're saying PC games because Microsoft can do a similar thing with Xbox Live if they want.

182
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what are you gonna survey?

183
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,826
Speaker 0: Everyone has an Xbox.

184
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:39,490
Speaker 0: They're all the same.

185
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:48,950
Speaker 0: You're talking about serving PC hardware, you know, so with You know, so valve learned from surveying PC hardware the gathering data about games.

186
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:54,127
Speaker 0: It would be about gamers and the way they play the games is valuable and they've been collecting that since.

187
00:11:54,408 --> 00:12:02,257
Speaker 1: but anyway they've released a big dump of a whole bunch of statistics from Team Fortress 2 and a Lot of people are making a big deal about these.

188
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:05,690
Speaker 1: but I actually saw very few interesting or surprising things.

189
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,449
Speaker 1: I mean they show you don't like if you count the total percentage of time played.

190
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:15,030
Speaker 1: Most people are scouts or engineers or soldiers and then it drops down pretty steadily and no one wants to play the medic.

191
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:21,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know because those those are the classes that are more sort of generally useful.

192
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,549
Speaker 1: You know points per hour sniper heavy spy soldier and then it's just down from there.

193
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:32,193
Speaker 1: You know average kills per hour heavy soldier sniper pyro The interest.

194
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,000
Speaker 1: well, I guess this isn't interesting at all either.

195
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,970
Speaker 1: but in terms of assists the medic is number one.

196
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,608
Speaker 1: but that's because I think the medic gets points for healing and the assist whatever.

197
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:48,587
Speaker 1: but The pyro is pretty much the number two along with the heavy and that kind of People on fire, but then they die from something else.

198
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,710
Speaker 1: Yep I go on and I mean obviously the scout gets the most captures per hour with the pyro being number two.

199
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,709
Speaker 1: I can't use the pyro more than anything.

200
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:00,730
Speaker 0: I capture is the scout mostly cuz I scout practice, but I haven't played this game in like months.

201
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,902
Speaker 1: yeah engineers live the longest medics live the least.

202
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:08,145
Speaker 1: so I guess Dave was a Very good in making his comic.

203
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:10,301
Speaker 1: Yeah And it goes on.

204
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:10,988
Speaker 1: and on this guy.

205
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:15,463
Speaker 1: I want to point out one really interesting thing that kind of emerged from all this?

206
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:22,268
Speaker 1: people play gravel pit the most which I don't understand because I don't like that map at all and They love here it is.

207
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:25,590
Speaker 0: I didn't play the game long enough to match the nap map names with the maps.

208
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:26,999
Speaker 1: So the map pretty much.

209
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,429
Speaker 1: if it's not to fort fuck you.

210
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:35,650
Speaker 1: But unless it's one of those kind of like weapons factory maps that was hacked into some custom server somewhere.

211
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:41,408
Speaker 1: but percentages of wins by team color versus stalemates.

212
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:43,236
Speaker 1: now I'm to fort.

213
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:47,030
Speaker 1: there's a tiny blue advantage, but you know, it's perfectly symmetrical.

214
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:55,488
Speaker 1: So you could obviously argue that you know, it's close enough except for the fact that if you count stalemates There's red loses a lot.

215
00:13:56,474 --> 00:14:06,970
Speaker 1: red loses a lot on team for on our CTF to fort and CP well and TC hydro and CP greater e really is blues a barrier.

216
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,830
Speaker 1: But yet on dust bowl and gravel pit red kicks their ass.

217
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:14,298
Speaker 1: Dust bowl is very clearly weighted toward red.

218
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:15,601
Speaker 0: I know see wait are these?

219
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,670
Speaker 0: see it depends which maps are symmetrical, right?

220
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,450
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing to fort is perfectly symmetrical, right?

221
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:30,823
Speaker 1: And yet blue edges out like over the 50% mark winning and then there's a wide band of stalemates And then red comes in right?

222
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:35,428
Speaker 0: So here's the question Is that a psychological thing because of the color of blue versus the color of red?

223
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:48,511
Speaker 0: Which could is probably a good explanation both in terms of maybe dumb punk kids pick red the same way dumb punk kids pick scissors Or more a psychological thing like, you know blue is calming, you know, and red is more us You're.

224
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:51,889
Speaker 0: you're shooting faster when you see a red guy or it's easier to see a red guy.

225
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,698
Speaker 1: It might be that he's easier to see a red guy.

226
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,381
Speaker 0: It could be that.

227
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,229
Speaker 0: or is it something where?

228
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:05,100
Speaker 0: Players who are better tend to pick blue because they you know and there's something psychological in Color choice and also skills.

229
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:17,110
Speaker 1: the type of person with high skill is also Correlates heavily with the kind of person who picks blue, you know It is weird because I have to admit when I played weapons factory I pretty much would always join the blue team unless I was prevented from doing so.

230
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would always pick the green team no matter what it is red and blue.

231
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,138
Speaker 0: I know that's why there is when it's red I use auto-pick.

232
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:29,934
Speaker 1: There was a green team in quad CTF Mmm, that was great.

233
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:36,470
Speaker 1: It was just regular quake to like lithium CTF, but there were four teams and four flags and four bases.

234
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,257
Speaker 1: It got crazy.

235
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:40,687
Speaker 0: or could this be some sort of fluke thing?

236
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:43,596
Speaker 0: for example Let's say you join it.

237
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:46,330
Speaker 0: There's a new server starts up right and you click auto join.

238
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:49,750
Speaker 0: Does that put you on blue first or on red first or is it random?

239
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:54,429
Speaker 0: Cuz if it says if for example if it's blue first That would make a lot of blue wins, wouldn't it?

240
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,565
Speaker 1: Well, the other cool thing is they have heat maps of where people die the most.

241
00:15:59,208 --> 00:15:59,710
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

242
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,242
Speaker 1: It's really cool to look at and I just want to point out that on a granary.

243
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:10,410
Speaker 1: It's almost perfectly Identically symmetrical and in the exact center is this epicenter of carnage?

244
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:18,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would study those I was still playing I would study those maps and I would avoid those areas Avoid those areas and shoot at those areas.

245
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:20,917
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

246
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, these stats are kind of cool.

247
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:32,390
Speaker 1: I wish they'd gathered more stats because I really want to see statistics in terms of I Don't know very exact numbers as to how many stalemates there are and all that sort of thing and people

248
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,608
Speaker 0: statistics and heat mass for counter-strike broken down by version from beta 1 up.

249
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:46,440
Speaker 1: Oh man Because you know when they first added the p90 that there were there was pretty much carnage everywhere And then when they toned down the p90 there was still carnage.

250
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,490
Speaker 0: ever happy people quit the game and then a hundred more people joined.

251
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:50,638
Speaker 1: All right.

252
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,423
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

253
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:58,910
Speaker 0: All right, so Remember I talked about before there's a Hokuto no Ken DS, which is sort of like elite beat agents.

254
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,589
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's manga plus, you know elite beat agents action.

255
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:06,228
Speaker 0: Well, they're taking it a step further and a step better.

256
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:13,230
Speaker 0: Instead of making sort of interactive manga for the DS one company is pretty much saying you know what?

257
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,538
Speaker 0: Let's just make manga for the DS straight up.

258
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,670
Speaker 0: Not even like interactive manga just manga for the DS.

259
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,329
Speaker 0: I mean you have the ability to like, you know bookmark and stuff like that, you know.

260
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,144
Speaker 0: And maybe there might be a little bit of animation who knows whatever.

261
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:30,635
Speaker 0: but they're putting out Phoenix for the DS.

262
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,303
Speaker 1: damn what just like you buy a cartridge its Phoenix.

263
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:36,191
Speaker 0: you buy cartridges and there's like five volumes of Phoenix on There.

264
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:42,290
Speaker 1: at least one kid is gonna buy that or get that thinking it's a game and gonna be so pissed off.

265
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:45,590
Speaker 0: The DS cart packs in between four to five volumes of manga.

266
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,870
Speaker 0: But it's unknown which tales will be a part of the package something something something.

267
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,406
Speaker 0: It's kind of cool idea stylus scrolling and useful bookmark feature for short reads.

268
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,714
Speaker 0: Oh and sound effects Sound effects.

269
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:57,800
Speaker 0: you say sound effects.

270
00:17:58,524 --> 00:17:59,690
Speaker 1: I don't know how I feel about this.

271
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:09,309
Speaker 1: I feel like on one hand I would never use something like this because I have the manga and it's much easier to read the Book and I guess if I wanted an e-reader, I would probably buy that Sony thing.

272
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:16,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, DS really not the best for e-reader, I'm pretty much waiting off on e-readers until until there's something perfect.

273
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

274
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:19,970
Speaker 0: Well, then again, there's two perfects cuz I'm living fine without one.

275
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,449
Speaker 1: Just well, there's three perfects.

276
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,250
Speaker 1: It kind of relates I guess now to the the thing Scott and I just watched that we're probably gonna talk about next Thursday.

277
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for me perfect is one.

278
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:32,570
Speaker 1: I just hit a button and the information is in my brain as though I had read it.

279
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,689
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm not waiting that long or two.

280
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:40,983
Speaker 1: I can just see the word scrolling in front of my eyes with whatever Translucency and color I want at any time.

281
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:42,110
Speaker 0: that is also perfect.

282
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,673
Speaker 0: But I'll still.

283
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:46,600
Speaker 1: I'll still buy something that's less than three glasses that do the same thing So it doesn't have to be in my.

284
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:47,490
Speaker 0: it's more realistic.

285
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,619
Speaker 0: But I'm still or for buy something less than that.

286
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,943
Speaker 1: if it was just it felt like a book and it looked like a book But I could just put a flash card in the bottom.

287
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:54,830
Speaker 1: I just flip the pages.

288
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:58,642
Speaker 0: I would buy that too, but that's also more than what I'm willing to buy.

289
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:05,361
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't know beyond that I'm thinking just Handheld device doesn't hurt the eyes to look at it.

290
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:06,405
Speaker 0: Good battery life.

291
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:07,730
Speaker 1: That's only things getting close.

292
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:11,366
Speaker 0: I got a sense too big and has all the problems.

293
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:12,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's close.

294
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,597
Speaker 1: It's a lot closer than I expected.

295
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:14,762
Speaker 1: We were we would be about now.

296
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:17,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still not close enough though It's somewhere somewhere in between.

297
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:18,778
Speaker 1: I'll say this when I'm

298
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:20,503
Speaker 0: a digital book and that like

299
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:30,690
Speaker 1: even now if I'm reading cuz I have you Know Safari books online I can read whatever tech books I want there But I often find myself printing out a chapter and reading it somewhere when I could just be sitting in front of the computer.

300
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:35,790
Speaker 0: I'm thinking like iPhone with a with a special book screen or book screen mode.

301
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:46,939
Speaker 0: That's what I'm thinking for realism in the near future things of the day.

302
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:55,371
Speaker 1: So we found this last week and I didn't get a chance to talk about it since I think we put up the questions episode Last Tuesday, so I think it's about time.

303
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,214
Speaker 0: I thought it was less.

304
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:56,656
Speaker 0: No.

305
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,620
Speaker 0: No, maybe I don't remember.

306
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:58,731
Speaker 1: I think it was last Tuesday.

307
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,005
Speaker 1: I don't remember cuz otherwise I think we would have talked about this.

308
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:16,215
Speaker 1: but there's a game a little video game made by Jason Rohrer For the Coco Romis gamma 256 event which looks like it was some sort of video game contest and there's a bunch of little games that people have made and I think the rules worry.

309
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:24,780
Speaker 1: it had to be a Windows XP game that used the Xbox 360 controller Mm-hmm, and people made a bunch of really weird little quirky games.

310
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,997
Speaker 1: They vary wildly, but this one in particular really stood out.

311
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:38,719
Speaker 1: now the main reason I want you all to see this game and play it is that Every now and then people make the argument that video games aren't art or that video games are somehow lower different.

312
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:45,080
Speaker 1: or I Contend that this game is effectively what I you know subjective and all that high art.

313
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:53,443
Speaker 1: I think this game is proof beyond any reasonable doubt that video games as a medium are most definitely Artistic.

314
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:54,889
Speaker 0: not only that.

315
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,459
Speaker 0: this is like maybe a masterpiece of art.

316
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:05,812
Speaker 0: I would not know what is technically masterpiece mean because I mean it's not like, you know Picasso level but it's like right below that.

317
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:06,916
Speaker 1: this is a game.

318
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:07,840
Speaker 1: That's so simple.

319
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:11,298
Speaker 1: I almost feel like I don't want to ruin it by telling you about it.

320
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,169
Speaker 0: No But just the entire game is a metaphor.

321
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,300
Speaker 0: every single thing in the game is a very obvious and very simple metaphor.

322
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:20,445
Speaker 0: That is very poignant.

323
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:28,556
Speaker 1: and yet the game is 100 pixels by 16 pixels Yep, and you only get to play in 100 by 12 of those pixels.

324
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:33,897
Speaker 1: Yep, and I'd say play it more than once you might discover some things.

325
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,548
Speaker 1: the game I think poignant.

326
00:21:35,568 --> 00:21:45,611
Speaker 0: the only controls in this game Are you push any button to start the game and then use up down left and right and make sure you try to use up Down left and right in every way you can because you will learn more things.

327
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:49,144
Speaker 1: and make sure that you have sound because the music Is very important to this.

328
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,247
Speaker 0: Mmm, very important.

329
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:53,900
Speaker 1: And uh, yeah, you you can bring a person along or not in the game.

330
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,878
Speaker 1: You'll see that I just want to point that out because I we didn't notice that at first.

331
00:21:56,979 --> 00:22:05,731
Speaker 0: and You can go right you can go down you can go up you can go left Poignant and a little sad but yet at the same time a little inspirational.

332
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:07,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, seriously.

333
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:09,120
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding check this out.

334
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,584
Speaker 0: We're not making stuff up here.

335
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:14,136
Speaker 1: And if you don't like this game, well, you're probably dead inside.

336
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:18,000
Speaker 0: No, most definitely Oh, and if you're dead inside this will deaden you more inside.

337
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:21,676
Speaker 0: if such if such a thing is Possible all right.

338
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:27,198
Speaker 0: So I was having a tough time figuring out which of my many things that I have collected to use.

339
00:22:27,238 --> 00:22:27,880
Speaker 0: but check this out.

340
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,994
Speaker 0: Right, there's a guy on YouTube and his YouTube name is soda Popinski 75.

341
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:37,998
Speaker 1: All right He's already awesome because soda Popinski is my band soda Popinski.

342
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:46,643
Speaker 0: Oh, man Sorry, so this dude he made an arcade cabinet like, you know pieces of wood TV Buttons joystick.

343
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:52,480
Speaker 0: the whole works, right, but he made his arcade cabinet with a special theme if you will.

344
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,979
Speaker 0: He made it with the Metroid themes.

345
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:59,520
Speaker 0: It's it's a. it looks if there was such a thing as a Metroid arcade machine.

346
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,329
Speaker 0: This is pretty close to what it would look like.

347
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:05,000
Speaker 0: In fact, it's probably better than what the actual thing would look like.

348
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:24,847
Speaker 0: In this video he sort of plays a Metroid remix while he you know shows off his you know Cabinet that he made and It's sort of annoying this video because he keeps showing you like mostly this like mother brain sculpture He put in the side of it that has like a little in like a little lit up chamber Sort of on the side of the cabinet.

349
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,177
Speaker 0: and it's sort of annoying because you don't get to see.

350
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,879
Speaker 0: you get to see that More than you get to see the actual entire cabinet itself.

351
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:34,032
Speaker 0: But you do get to see the cabinet itself and it's a YouTube videos.

352
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,180
Speaker 0: Just pause it whatever and take a look.

353
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:37,300
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

354
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:44,200
Speaker 0: I wish I could make an arcade cabinet like that because that'd be cool to have in the house if I had room Next to my air hockey table, right?

355
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,785
Speaker 1: So without further ado tonight what we're gonna talk about a game that I feel we should review Worms 2 for the DS.

356
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:54,534
Speaker 0: I think it's worms to open warfare.

357
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the technical name.

358
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should probably look it up, but it's worms - yeah All right.

359
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,457
Speaker 0: Let's just start off by saying that there there worms is a game that's on many platforms.

360
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:09,957
Speaker 0: on the DS There was worms open warfare and I think worms to open warfare or worms open warfare - I'm not sure.

361
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:27,194
Speaker 1: worms the original worms just worms for the Nintendo DS is Perhaps one of the most disappointing games ever made in terms of what it should have been what it could have been What it was and what it was was something that you couldn't fucking play.

362
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:29,080
Speaker 0: Okay, here we go worms open warfare.

363
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:33,174
Speaker 0: The first one right was for the DS and the PSP and the DS.

364
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:37,328
Speaker 0: Oh worms open warfare was Terrible like unplayable shit.

365
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,254
Speaker 0: Don't even buy it.

366
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,338
Speaker 0: Don't even look at it pretend.

367
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:40,860
Speaker 0: It doesn't exist.

368
00:24:41,662 --> 00:24:48,620
Speaker 0: All right worms open warfare 2 for the DS Not bad, and that's the game we both bought.

369
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:56,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, the worms franchise is like 13 years old and we're not really gonna talk about that because it's kind of interesting But not really.

370
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:57,959
Speaker 1: it's been released on like every platform.

371
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's just let's talk about what worms is in general, right?

372
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:01,656
Speaker 1: All right.

373
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:05,495
Speaker 1: It's one of those I'd call it a scorch like well worms a little different from scorch.

374
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,225
Speaker 0: Oh it is it is It is a thing.

375
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,313
Speaker 0: Let's talk about scorched earth.

376
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,300
Speaker 0: We ever talked about scorched earth?

377
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:11,460
Speaker 1: I don't know we should probably do a show on that by itself.

378
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:18,391
Speaker 1: But there back in the day, you know when video game PC gaming was in its infancy There was a game called I think tank wars or tanks.

379
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:19,556
Speaker 1: There's a lot of similar games.

380
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:20,500
Speaker 0: There are many many games.

381
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,680
Speaker 0: I mean I played one on the old Mac that was called cannon fodder and I know there's another game called cannon fodder But I don't know what that game is like.

382
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:33,642
Speaker 1: But there all these games eventually culminated in perhaps the perfection of that game and it was a game called scorched earth Mm-hmm.

383
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:42,910
Speaker 1: You have little tanks and you use your money you buy weapons and you shoot at all the other little tanks and this game is Fucking legendary.

384
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:44,200
Speaker 0: Oh, this game is amazing.

385
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:58,563
Speaker 0: basically, the way these games work is that there's a map a 2d map and you're looking at it from the side and tanks are positioned randomly or perhaps not randomly on the map and this hills and this terrain and whatever and You control.

386
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:04,745
Speaker 0: your tank doesn't really move so much and you can control the angle of your tanks gun Like it's a piece of artillery.

387
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:05,126
Speaker 0: so you can.

388
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,896
Speaker 0: the angle you can control either, you know 180 degrees of motion.

389
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,655
Speaker 0: It can either fire straight left straight right straight up or anywhere in between.

390
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:16,540
Speaker 0: you can't fire down though Cuz you're a tank you can't really shoot below your treads.

391
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,322
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

392
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:21,757
Speaker 0: and then you adjust the level of power with which you are going to shoot.

393
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:46,532
Speaker 0: so you can shoot with Full power which pretty much would make it a straight shot or you can shoot with less power Which sort of make an arcing shot, you know would shoot and then it would lose speed and energy and it would sort of fall to the ground and gravity would you know, take it control and the idea was to manipulate the angle and the power of your shots to hit the other tanks and you sort of had to Sort of is like artillery, you know, you shoot thought you shot too far.

394
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:47,315
Speaker 0: lower the power.

395
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,547
Speaker 0: Okay, that was too close You know lower the angle.

396
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,190
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

397
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,055
Speaker 1: He's got a bead on me.

398
00:26:51,096 --> 00:26:51,699
Speaker 1: I got a move.

399
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:53,607
Speaker 1: I knocked the ground out from under him.

400
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:54,772
Speaker 1: Oh, he's got a parachute.

401
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,258
Speaker 1: He's got a deflector shield.

402
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:56,800
Speaker 1: That's okay.

403
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,363
Speaker 1: I got a nuke.

404
00:26:57,524 --> 00:27:00,400
Speaker 0: you start to throw in all sorts of weapons and items and abilities.

405
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, suddenly the game gets crazy go nuts.

406
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:16,388
Speaker 0: and when you include the you know, the extra strategy of manipulating the terrain of the game You know creating more terrain Eliminating terrain because a lot of it would be like, you know, there's two guys the hill in the way It's it's who can shoot over the hill accurately.

407
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,260
Speaker 0: Okay, what do I just destroy the hill then I shoot you.

408
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,959
Speaker 0: You know that that's that's what these games come down to and they're pretty fun.

409
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:23,264
Speaker 1: He's a ride bomb.

410
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:26,175
Speaker 1: get may put someone a little depression then fill it with napalm.

411
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:27,299
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the best.

412
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,098
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not the best but one of the best.

413
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:52,704
Speaker 1: Now these this game is great and worms is on the surface very similar to this game, but definitely on the surface It's a. it's a similar game but instead of having tanks little worms and instead of shooting, you know, nuclear weapons and bombs and napalm and all these things you shoot Buffaloes of lies and Uzi's holy hand grenades and sheep and super sheep and also bazookas Donkeys.

414
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:54,071
Speaker 0: the bazooka is the default weapon.

415
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:55,600
Speaker 0: The grenade is also the default weapon.

416
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:59,137
Speaker 1: I think the buffalo of lies is my favorite weapon at any game ever.

417
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,333
Speaker 0: just for the name I kind of like the buffalo of lies.

418
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,119
Speaker 0: It's not bad.

419
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:09,976
Speaker 0: yeah, and you have all these different weapons and some of the weapons are actually other things like rope and teleporters and jetpacks to let you move around.

420
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:22,629
Speaker 0: you can actually You know, basically the way it works is on your turn one of your worms is activated and you can move that worm for some specified amount of time and you can jump and move left and right and you can even do a backflip to jump up instead of sideways.

421
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:26,980
Speaker 0: and Then at any point you can use some of your weapons, right?

422
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,820
Speaker 0: And you have a whole bunch of weapons and some weapons like say the jetpack or the rope.

423
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:34,011
Speaker 0: You can use them and your turn won't end when you use them.

424
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:36,800
Speaker 0: so you can jetpack and then use another weapon right after that.

425
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:44,640
Speaker 0: But other weapons like the bazooka or grenade or pretty much anything that does damage It's gonna end your turn after you use it.

426
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,640
Speaker 0: So if I shoot my bazooka, I shoot it and maybe I hit you.

427
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,203
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't.

428
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,680
Speaker 0: and then if the game might give me like five seconds to like move around.

429
00:28:51,841 --> 00:29:00,360
Speaker 0: So maybe if I want to like drop a stick of dynamite I could drop the stick of dynamite on the ground because you really can't throw it and then run away before it kills me.

430
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,339
Speaker 0: Cuz you know it drops right next to me.

431
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:10,166
Speaker 1: So if scorched earth was a game of accurate shooting and weapon selection, this is much more a game of Platforming and positioning.

432
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:13,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of like what versus Mario.

433
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:30,379
Speaker 0: in a way It's like on your turn you get to Mario it up, but it also weapons, you know so and you sort of have to have the skill of jumping the skill of positioning the skill of navigating terrain and the skill of utilizing various equipment to help you navigate terrain.

434
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:43,973
Speaker 0: and You know get yourself in a good offensive position Doing as much damage using you know a weapon and all the weapons even the really powerful ones Take some amount of skill to use and yet to know which one is best except the donkey.

435
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:46,199
Speaker 1: the donkey requires zero skill.

436
00:29:46,882 --> 00:29:48,809
Speaker 0: Some of them require more skill than others.

437
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:51,017
Speaker 0: The donkey requires a tiny bit of skill.

438
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,086
Speaker 1: It doesn't kill.

439
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:58,076
Speaker 1: it requires at least the some section of your prefrontal cortex to be intact.

440
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:05,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the that skill in a way the the boomerang where however it requires a great deal more skill than the donkey.

441
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:14,353
Speaker 0: and You know you use a weapon if you want which you probably should and then you you know Try to get into a defensive position and then you continue and you just keep.

442
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:17,914
Speaker 0: everyone takes turns until someone wins By killing all the other guys worms.

443
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:18,700
Speaker 1: now this game.

444
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,385
Speaker 1: I mean nominally.

445
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:21,640
Speaker 1: there's a single player and you can play it to get good at the game.

446
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,240
Speaker 1: But this game is basically nothing unless all your friends buy it and you play it together.

447
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:30,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there is a way you can play the multiplayer with single cart mode.

448
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:30,800
Speaker 0: It sucks.

449
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,790
Speaker 0: It's good for introducing someone to the game.

450
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:40,238
Speaker 0: It's good for I got nothing better to do right now Let's play some worms, but really it sucks because it's it's random.

451
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:54,134
Speaker 0: first of all It's a basic a random shitty map limited weapon selection limited customizability of the multiplayer mode And the person who owns the cartridge or is using the cartridge always goes first Which is a big advantage especially in a two-player game.

452
00:30:54,415 --> 00:31:00,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk about the Customizability a bit because you can customize Everything you can.

453
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:02,680
Speaker 1: you name all your worms you name your team you make your flag.

454
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,855
Speaker 1: My flag is up somewhat distinctive my flag.

455
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:06,920
Speaker 0: I'm still drawing my flag.

456
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, my flag is up something distinctive and Scott's is like a quarter of a boo.

457
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:16,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta draw the rest of that boo and you know you pick what color your worms are what dance they do it.

458
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:19,176
Speaker 1: There's so much stuff in this game and you make your only little team.

459
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:19,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go.

460
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:24,520
Speaker 0: Every worms game has had that but this worms game continues that you know proud tradition.

461
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:26,859
Speaker 1: It looks like it's got my seat too, but I haven't tried it.

462
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:34,187
Speaker 1: Oh, does it have hot seat and it looks like I could make more than one human opponent and a non Multi-cart like non multiplayer game.

463
00:31:34,488 --> 00:31:37,877
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you have multi-cart multiplayer or perhaps hot seat.

464
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,720
Speaker 0: I haven't tested it.

465
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,257
Speaker 0: Well some reviewers we are right.

466
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:46,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because we're so awesome you can have a fully customized multiplayer game and the way this works is.

467
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:52,620
Speaker 0: you make a scheme in this sort of the scheme editor for All the rules of your particular worms game and you can set pretty much any rule.

468
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,270
Speaker 0: You can say worms can move worms can't move.

469
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:58,080
Speaker 0: after shooting you get this many seconds to move around.

470
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,448
Speaker 0: before shooting you get this many seconds to move around.

471
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:10,831
Speaker 0: these weapons are available and these other weapons are available at this time to Get this much ammo and this yeah You can set it to be like, okay on the first turn Everyone only has airstrikes and you get this many of them.

472
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:13,080
Speaker 0: and then on the third turn you get this many.

473
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:14,949
Speaker 0: You know bazooka shots.

474
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:20,553
Speaker 0: and on the fifth turn you you can change Everything to make exactly the kind of game you want to play.

475
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:22,260
Speaker 0: you can make it crazy weapons.

476
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,701
Speaker 0: You can make it know only melee weapons you know.

477
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,247
Speaker 1: the coolest thing is that you make.

478
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:32,460
Speaker 1: you set all this up and you save all these presets and Then you can sit around and hey you want to play the blah blah blah preset.

479
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's go.

480
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:36,460
Speaker 0: the game comes with a few presets, but some of them are not so good.

481
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:37,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, even better.

482
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:40,314
Speaker 1: You can pretty much make any freaking terrain you want.

483
00:32:40,354 --> 00:32:41,780
Speaker 1: It has a fantastic terrain editor.

484
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, the terrain editor is a little.

485
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:46,500
Speaker 0: you know Any terrain editor is a little weird and hard to get used to at first.

486
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:49,300
Speaker 0: But as soon as I figured it out, I was making terrain like a champ.

487
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, the learning curve is steep.

488
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,960
Speaker 1: But when I say fantastic, I guess I should say that in the sense that you can do anything.

489
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:56,926
Speaker 0: Anything is possible.

490
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:00,720
Speaker 0: And the other thing is the game doesn't really come with such as great selection of maps.

491
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:03,738
Speaker 0: so you pretty much have to make a map which is good and bad.

492
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:19,940
Speaker 0: cuz Good because well you and all your friends since you'll have the cartridge will all be making maps and you'll be able to you know play maps other people and I think you can trade maps, but I'm not quite sure how and You know, you can make really big maps that way which provide the most interesting play experiences.

493
00:33:20,522 --> 00:33:23,171
Speaker 0: But then again, you have to put an effort to make a map.

494
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:28,170
Speaker 0: if you just use random maps or auto-generated maps It's gonna be kind of boring and crappy now.

495
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:33,634
Speaker 1: This is one of those special games where Skill is a very large factor in who will win.

496
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:44,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, for example When I had played beaten the single-player and I played against people who like rim who had barely played it I pretty much won every time because I knew how to use all the weapons.

497
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:50,602
Speaker 0: I'd practice using all the weapons I knew which ones to use in which situations and You know I could.

498
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:58,637
Speaker 0: I was better at navigating to terrain and I used it took me less time on my turn to do things Which allowed me to get into better positions, etc, etc.

499
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:05,251
Speaker 1: But then after playing against him a bunch and then you know Actually starting to play the single-player the tie turned a bit.

500
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:10,449
Speaker 1: because now Oh rims really good with grenades Yeah, you know it there's.

501
00:34:11,232 --> 00:34:13,299
Speaker 0: there is also a certain amount of randomness in the.

502
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,286
Speaker 1: well That's what I was getting at.

503
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:23,560
Speaker 1: Yeah skill is a big factor But at the same time like I one game I totally hosed Scott like partly because he started in a really bad spot just randomly.

504
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:30,172
Speaker 0: I think that is the biggest random factor in the game is starting positions Especially on a map where it's possible to just fall in the water.

505
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,020
Speaker 0: because I mean worms have health, right?

506
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,266
Speaker 0: Unlike say scorched earth.

507
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:35,056
Speaker 0: Well scorched earth yet takes that health.

508
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,868
Speaker 1: Yeah Yes, they did.

509
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,699
Speaker 1: They had like they had a hundred health.

510
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:47,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you hit him with a direct hit with it with the big the baby, you know the normal shot Yeah, but direct hits were kind of rare especially when you also had shields and things.

511
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,100
Speaker 0: and yeah Well, you had to get the shields and things happens later.

512
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:54,436
Speaker 0: But basically the worms have a hundred health and pretty much nothing does a hundred damage.

513
00:34:54,456 --> 00:35:08,425
Speaker 0: in order to do a hundred damage like you have to get someone in a situation where you hit them with like a really powerful weapon and they happen to be standing next to dangerous stuff and After that stuff blows up it knocks them into more dangerous stuff Which also blows up.

514
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,219
Speaker 0: or use the orgy or they get a lot of falling damage.

515
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:11,963
Speaker 0: Donkey.

516
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:16,100
Speaker 0: the donkey or the banana bomb will also do a lot of damage, but those are the only ones.

517
00:35:16,623 --> 00:35:23,660
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much impossible to kill a worm in one shot except Knocking them into the water or off the map sort of in a Smash Brothers style.

518
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,533
Speaker 0: So you'll see on a map where it's possible to be knocked into the water.

519
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:42,239
Speaker 0: The best strategy is pretty much Get over directly next to your opponent Especially if they're near the edge of the map and use like the you know The dragon uppercut, you know, which is a direct copy from Street Fighter, you know sure you can and just knock him in the water.

520
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:44,796
Speaker 0: and That's what everyone does.

521
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:50,900
Speaker 1: This game despite the fact I mean, it's you know, it's really skill based but there's also a lot of randomness there.

522
00:35:51,422 --> 00:35:52,305
Speaker 1: It's really fun.

523
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:53,328
Speaker 1: And it's not like.

524
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:58,829
Speaker 1: you know, you play a German board game and you realize this random you lose and it's ah I lost because the game just fucked me.

525
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:00,475
Speaker 1: There's nothing I could have done and your friends go.

526
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:00,816
Speaker 1: Yep.

527
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:01,700
Speaker 1: That's how it goes.

528
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:05,960
Speaker 1: Haha, and this game is like, oh man, I totally just lost.

529
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:31,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what makes the game so great is that no matter how many times you play it right in every single play of The game especially a big multiplayer play Something crazy always happens at least once something absolutely crazy hilarious Like someone will throw a grenade and you know what they're trying to do and then something totally unexpected happens like a worm You know gets blown, you know to the other side of the map maybe.

530
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:42,204
Speaker 0: and then something crazy like a crazy coincidence like something falls out of the sky and then something blows up in an Unexpected way and something moves in an unexpected way and then oh my god It's hilarious.

531
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:52,079
Speaker 1: or I blow up the last worm and and I win I'm God killed him but his body Flies and just bounces off the ceiling and lands right next to my worm and then blows up.

532
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:53,148
Speaker 0: Cuz there's me.

533
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:59,040
Speaker 0: every time a worm dies He detonates himself which makes a little tiny explosion and most of the time that doesn't have much of an effect.

534
00:36:59,502 --> 00:37:09,190
Speaker 0: But if you kill someone who's right next to you or right next to one of your guys That especially if you're really close to the bottom of the map where you know It could make a hole and drop you both in the water.

535
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty awesome Pretty awesome.

536
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:23,020
Speaker 1: So if you have friends who have DS's you should buy as many copies of worms, too For the DS as you have friends and DS's at least up to four.

537
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:28,442
Speaker 0: I mean there are lots of iterations of worms for the PC and many other systems and some of them are good and some Of them are bad.

538
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:32,540
Speaker 1: I think this is the best one only because of the ease of play with friends.

539
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,806
Speaker 0: I definitely have to say that even if there are other Editions of worms.

540
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:37,515
Speaker 0: I haven't played every edition of worms out there.

541
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,520
Speaker 0: There might be a better one.

542
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:48,292
Speaker 0: there might be not who knows but because this one is portable and because it's on the DS and because of the Features inside of it I definitely recommend it more highly than any other other ones.

543
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:53,755
Speaker 0: because worms is sort of like the game that Perfectly lends itself to portability more more than anything else.

544
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:56,949
Speaker 0: if you whip it out You can play a game in like five minutes.

545
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,160
Speaker 0: It's hilarious every time and awesome.

546
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,004
Speaker 0: You wanna say anything else?

547
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:01,707
Speaker 1: I don't know.

548
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:02,872
Speaker 1: I think that kind of wraps it up.

549
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:03,837
Speaker 0: It's kind of short.

550
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:04,560
Speaker 1: That's fine.

551
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,627
Speaker 1: We can do a short episode.

552
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,760
Speaker 1: We'll have a lot of long episodes to come.

553
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,517
Speaker 1: I think tomorrow when we talk about the festival we'll go on for a bit.

554
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:16,900
Speaker 0: Yep Alright, but yeah worms and you know any other kind of worms type game also.

555
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:20,740
Speaker 0: There are also some 3d worms type games, but I don't know if you want to play those.

556
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,660
Speaker 0: I've played them a few times and they're the ones of the GameCube.

557
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:28,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of it's fun, but it's fun in this really frustrating way.

558
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:29,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, not quite good.

559
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:34,064
Speaker 0: Oh one more thing to say about worms though is that there's a rope in in worms Which it's pretty much.

560
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:37,257
Speaker 0: it's like you shoot it and it grabs on to a wall or ceiling.

561
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:48,640
Speaker 0: that rope is great And you can you can you know lengthen or shorten the rope and you can swing back and forth and you know Do both at the same time and many games have tried to implement some sort of grappling hook mechanic.

562
00:38:49,402 --> 00:39:00,675
Speaker 0: This game implements the grappling hook mechanic better than any game ever even better than bionic commando and every other 2d game that wants to have some sort of rope or hook should just Copy worms 2ds.

563
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:10,352
