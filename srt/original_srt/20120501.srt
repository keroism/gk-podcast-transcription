1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,837
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 1st, 2012.

2
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:12,278
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:12,919
Speaker 2: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,483
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:17,650
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk to Luke Crane about his game, Mouseguard.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,464
Speaker 0: You may have heard of it.

7
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:22,209
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:27,529
Speaker 2: So it's warm today.

9
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:29,229
Speaker 0: It is pretty warm today.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,630
Speaker 2: But more importantly, today is the first of May.

11
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:34,969
Speaker 0: Very important day.

12
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,230
Speaker 0: It's the first of May.

13
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:40,990
Speaker 0: We're already outside of my office for whatever may happen.

14
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:43,708
Speaker 2: I was referring to the musical...

15
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:50,410
Speaker 0: I'm also referring to the musical representation of what happens on the first day of the month of May.

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:57,930
Speaker 2: If you have not heard the first of May and what you should do today, that's pretty much it.

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,670
Speaker 0: Well, you better get on that.

18
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:04,910
Speaker 0: So we've got an interview with Luke Crane, the designer of the Mouseguard game based on the comics.

19
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:07,990
Speaker 0: Based on the comics with the comics.

20
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,520
Speaker 0: So we're going to get right to that.

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,030
Speaker 0: We're going to skip news and that sort of thing.

22
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:22,230
Speaker 0: But first, I guess it's time for Things of the Day.

23
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,439
Speaker 2: No, it's the first of May.

24
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,850
Speaker 2: It's time for something completely different.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,330
Speaker 0: So I'm a big fan of videos.

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:41,167
Speaker 0: And the way I always describe this is it's a video that is a compilation of something from either a movie that keeps happening or a thing from a whole bunch of different media.

27
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:41,690
Speaker 0: that's all the same words.

28
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,510
Speaker 2: So you've used Things of the Day a lot of times, like all the glass breaking in Total Recall.

29
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:51,250
Speaker 0: Or my favorite version of Pulp Fiction that's just people saying the word fuck.

30
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:53,949
Speaker 2: Or every time Hank's peeing.

31
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:58,310
Speaker 0: You know, I can't help but see Tom Hanks and think about peeing now.

32
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,447
Speaker 0: If I ever meet him, I'm going to be like, "So what's up with you peeing in

33
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:01,849
Speaker 0: movies?".

34
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,870
Speaker 0: It's like part of your contract.

35
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,720
Speaker 2: These are called supercuts now.

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,390
Speaker 2: That's the word people have decided on.

37
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,074
Speaker 0: Well, people.

38
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:10,009
Speaker 0: So basically, someone made a site.

39
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,990
Speaker 0: And the idea is to collect all of these things that are defined as the noun supercut.

40
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:21,770
Speaker 0: A fast-paced montage of short video clips that obsessively isolate a single element from its source.

41
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,849
Speaker 0: Usually a word, phrase, or cliche from film or TV.

42
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,373
Speaker 0: So I love that.

43
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:33,069
Speaker 0: I live in a world where I can have a like, a desire, a hobby so specific as this.

44
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,289
Speaker 0: And there is a site now dedicated to it.

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,890
Speaker 2: So according to Urban Dictionary, a supercut is a fast-paced montage of short video clips that obsessively isolates a single element from its source.

46
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,450
Speaker 2: Usually a word, phrase, or cliche from film and TV.

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:45,755
Speaker 0: Look at that.

48
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:46,609
Speaker 0: We got two sources.

49
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,859
Speaker 2: I'm willing to bet the same guy.

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,466
Speaker 2: Oh, you know who typed this in?

51
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,450
Speaker 2: WaxPancake.

52
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,149
Speaker 2: That's Andy Baio, I think, is that guy.

53
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,790
Speaker 0: Well, this is a waxy.org project.

54
00:02:59,831 --> 00:02:59,872
Speaker 2: Oh.

55
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:05,190
Speaker 2: So he definitely is the one who typed it into whatever.

56
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,624
Speaker 0: Writer and tech entrepreneur in Portland, Oregon.

57
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:09,810
Speaker 0: He works on Expert Labs.

58
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,450
Speaker 2: He used to be the CTO of Kickstarter.

59
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,158
Speaker 0: Found it upcoming.

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,626
Speaker 0: Made an album and other stuff.

61
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,530
Speaker 0: I'm reading his webpage.

62
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,898
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's an important guy.

63
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,785
Speaker 2: You should know that guy.

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,750
Speaker 0: Alright, so that's what I got.

65
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,311
Speaker 2: Alright.

66
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:22,375
Speaker 2: So check this out.

67
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,363
Speaker 2: Some guy in Paris, there's a fountain.

68
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,025
Speaker 2: It's like a big pool.

69
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,744
Speaker 2: But it's not a still reflecting pool like in DC.

70
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:30,930
Speaker 2: It's a pool with fountains, right?

71
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,004
Speaker 2: And apparently, there's tables and chairs all around it.

72
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:35,110
Speaker 2: It's in a park, a public park.

73
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,650
Speaker 2: And people, you know, some guy sat near the fountain next to the side of the pool.

74
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,730
Speaker 2: And when the fountain went off, he took a picture from such an angle, or his friend did, that it looked like he was peeing the fountain because the fountain was on the other side of him.

75
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,690
Speaker 2: And it looked like he was having an enormous pee while sitting in the chair.

76
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,270
Speaker 0: Ho ho, a standard and classic picture.

77
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,826
Speaker 2: So he posted this picture to the internet and said,

78
00:03:57,866 --> 00:03:58,208
Speaker 2: "Lols."

79
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,010
Speaker 2: It's a good picture.

80
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,773
Speaker 2: Good picture.

81
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,909
Speaker 2: Someone replied and was like, "I took same picture, same

82
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:03,170
Speaker 2: fountain.".

83
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:09,290
Speaker 2: And people just started posting all the same picture with the same fountain with different people in it.

84
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,087
Speaker 0: Well, you got what I want to see is a picture from a long time ago, like on that like '70s sort of...

85
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,757
Speaker 2: So of course, some guy created a Tumblr.

86
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:23,799
Speaker 2: "Look, I'm original dot Tumblr dot com," which is... The title is "The Best Picture I Took in Paris.

87
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,287
Speaker 2: Holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa is so

88
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:27,971
Speaker 2: 2005.".

89
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,849
Speaker 2: And it's just every picture of people at this fountain and similar fountains doing the same thing.

90
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,038
Speaker 0: This is the revolution that Tumblr did.

91
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,489
Speaker 0: In the old days, you'd say, "Oh, that's the name of my cover

92
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:37,770
Speaker 0: band.".

93
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,417
Speaker 0: Or, "That'd be a great name for a metal

94
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:39,899
Speaker 0: band.".

95
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,370
Speaker 0: Or, "Rock band," I guess, before there was metal.

96
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,746
Speaker 0: But now, you say, "That's my new

97
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:45,048
Speaker 0: Tumblr.".

98
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:53,970
Speaker 0: Well, in a way... But the difference is that if you say that's your new Tumblr, most likely you're going to end up making that Tumblr because it doesn't take much effort.

99
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,690
Speaker 2: This is what I'm saying is that these Tumblr's are super cuts.

100
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, of the internet.

101
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,090
Speaker 2: It's a super cut of photos or a super cut of... Is that right?

102
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,470
Speaker 0: But super cut is a subset of those sorts of super cuts dedicated solely to that in the visual medium of movies and TV.

103
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,250
Speaker 2: Well, I want to know why they made supercuts.org instead of just a Tumblr, supercuts.tumblr, which would have been super cut of super cuts.

104
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,074
Speaker 0: Better branding.

105
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:18,968
Speaker 0: I mean, I would make a Radio Free Equestria site if I wasn't just lazy.

106
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,550
Speaker 2: But anyway, you get the idea.

107
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,090
Speaker 0: So very briefly, in the meta moment, we're going to be at Kineticon.

108
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:34,230
Speaker 0: If you wanted to submit a panel to run at Kineticon or a lecture or a workshop, the deadline's passed, so do it soon because I'm currently scheduling stuff.

109
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,490
Speaker 0: We will be at, not this weekend, but next weekend, ZenkaiCon, where we will be presenting a couple of lectures.

110
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,746
Speaker 0: PEX Prime is coming up in some months.

111
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:44,269
Speaker 0: We'll be there.

112
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,150
Speaker 0: And a bunch of other cons.

113
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,320
Speaker 0: If you want to see us at Otacon, we'll tell them.

114
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,949
Speaker 0: We submitted events like we always do.

115
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:54,170
Speaker 0: So Luke, we had you on the show some time ago with Jared.

116
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,190
Speaker 2: Some billion times.

117
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,630
Speaker 0: Talking about just games and stuff, but we've never actually really talked deeply about Mouseguard.

118
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,130
Speaker 1: I think it's been a while since we've talked about a game and just haven't shot the shit.

119
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:10,270
Speaker 2: Yeah, we pretty much always just talk about things in general or conceptual things and whatnot.

120
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,470
Speaker 0: Or the old days, we'd go to cons and hang out.

121
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,406
Speaker 2: And we're doing it now again.

122
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,204
Speaker 0: But now I think the problem is we're actually all busy at PAX.

123
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,370
Speaker 0: Like, actually busy.

124
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, for reals busy.

125
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,848
Speaker 2: And sick.

126
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:21,588
Speaker 0: Only you got sick.

127
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:23,949
Speaker 1: Well, Jared got half-sick.

128
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,070
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jared was also sick.

129
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:27,509
Speaker 2: The podcasting condition, that was for sure.

130
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,910
Speaker 0: There was an Otacon years ago where we could not talk for like three days after the con.

131
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,778
Speaker 0: I was coughing up blood.

132
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:32,989
Speaker 0: It was not a sight to see.

133
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:33,471
Speaker 1: Wow.

134
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's been a long time since I've lost my voice at a con, actually.

135
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,170
Speaker 1: I've learned to speak in a smooth con voice.

136
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,970
Speaker 0: And the trick is to not say stuff when you don't need to say stuff.

137
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,451
Speaker 1: True.

138
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:47,049
Speaker 1: There's a double trick for it for me, and that was hiring people to demo my games.

139
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,227
Speaker 2: Very good move.

140
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:51,010
Speaker 0: I feel like you can't hold it in when you're doing a demo.

141
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,870
Speaker 0: Like, once someone starts burning something.

142
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,830
Speaker 0: Sometimes metaphorically, sometimes not.

143
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm a man for funny voices, so I can't resist shouting my bad dwarven brogue.

144
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:05,990
Speaker 0: But yeah, Mouseguard.

145
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,430
Speaker 0: We've played Mouseguard a little bit, and I think I played with some of you guys once.

146
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,770
Speaker 0: I played a weird remake of Mouseguard, some fan made that was all steampunk at a con.

147
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:19,269
Speaker 0: Thor was in the same game.

148
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was at 11.11.

149
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,514
Speaker 0: It was at 11.11.

150
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:27,190
Speaker 1: That was my friend Mike Miller, who made a Gaslight version.

151
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,430
Speaker 0: It was actually neat, but it was the last game of Mouseguard I've played, because I've been so busy I haven't even played anything lately.

152
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,070
Speaker 2: We tried to play it once on our own, but I ran it and I wasn't so good.

153
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:37,969
Speaker 2: It was pretty sad.

154
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:44,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, it takes a bit of a mental shift to get into the Mouseguard mindset.

155
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:50,649
Speaker 1: Burning Wheel players have a hard time with it, because it tweaks a lot of the Burning Wheel rules and kind of throws a lot of them out, too.

156
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:58,250
Speaker 1: And people who play traditional roleplaying games have a hard time with it, too, because it introduces some paradigms that you don't see in traditional roleplaying games.

157
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,630
Speaker 0: So what's the biggest paradigm shift?

158
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:08,410
Speaker 0: D&D three and a half guy never went to four because he thinks it's not old school enough, but yet he's not old school enough to have played advanced dungeons.

159
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,630
Speaker 2: You mean the guy who's playing Pathfinder?

160
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,141
Speaker 2: Yeah.

161
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:12,919
Speaker 0: Or three and a half Pathfinder, like that guy.

162
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:14,885
Speaker 0: What's the biggest paradigm shift?

163
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,250
Speaker 0: What makes Mouseguard so different?

164
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,289
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's kind of a two-lane paradigm shift.

165
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,770
Speaker 1: On one hand, on the GM side, is the turn structure.

166
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:32,110
Speaker 1: We feel like we just kind of teased out how people really play roleplaying games, but we're arrogant pricks.

167
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,650
Speaker 1: We just made a game, and the game has a turn structure.

168
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:41,673
Speaker 1: And we gave it a turn structure because we wanted people who don't play roleplaying games to be able to come to it and say, "Oh, look, a game.

169
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:42,496
Speaker 1: A game has turns.

170
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:43,419
Speaker 1: This game has turns.

171
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,709
Speaker 1: In the turns, I say funny things, and I roll some

172
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:45,910
Speaker 1: dice.".

173
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,498
Speaker 1: Like, okay.

174
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,930
Speaker 1: It's not a big leap for people who don't play roleplaying games.

175
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,890
Speaker 1: People who do play roleplaying games, a turn structure such as it is is problematic.

176
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:56,709
Speaker 1: But get over it, people.

177
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:02,510
Speaker 1: And then on the player side of things, it's the idea that you're not power leveling.

178
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,840
Speaker 1: You're not power leveling.

179
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:08,670
Speaker 1: There's power gaming in Mouseguard, but it's just not in the same extent.

180
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,290
Speaker 1: It's very easy to power game in Mouseguard because we don't really care.

181
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,910
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of player-driven action.

182
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,710
Speaker 1: Your character and what your character wants is basically going to be the story.

183
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,158
Speaker 2: So the turns in Mouseguard, right?

184
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:23,250
Speaker 2: It's the player turn and the GM turn, right?

185
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,503
Speaker 2: Correct.

186
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,986
Speaker 2: It's not like a board game where your turn is very well-defined.

187
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,530
Speaker 2: Like, you do these actions and your turn is over, right?

188
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:34,189
Speaker 2: It's sort of like there's a long GM turn and then a little player turn.

189
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:35,690
Speaker 2: At least that's the way I felt.

190
00:09:37,072 --> 00:09:38,443
Speaker 1: The turns are about equal length, actually.

191
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:39,390
Speaker 1: It's deceptive.

192
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,430
Speaker 1: It seems like one is shorter than the other.

193
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,390
Speaker 1: Some people think the player's turn is longer than the GM's turn.

194
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,720
Speaker 1: Really?

195
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:44,887
Speaker 1: Okay.

196
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,289
Speaker 1: And some people think the GM's turn is longer than the player's turn.

197
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,810
Speaker 0: Scott, maybe it's because you never earn any checks.

198
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,285
Speaker 2: I don't earn checks for shit.

199
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:50,609
Speaker 2: I suck.

200
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,650
Speaker 1: Well, that's a trick to playing the game.

201
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,410
Speaker 1: And it's one of the trickiest parts of playing the game.

202
00:09:56,131 --> 00:10:01,689
Speaker 1: Because the GM has to give you a reason to earn checks, and then the player has to sit up and go, "Oh, it's time for you to earn

203
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:01,930
Speaker 1: checks.".

204
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,129
Speaker 1: But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

205
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,730
Speaker 1: People in TV land, podcast land, have no idea what the fuck we're talking about.

206
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,890
Speaker 0: So we're talking about the role-playing game Mouseguard, which was designed by the eminent Luke Crane here.

207
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:14,898
Speaker 1: I am not eminent.

208
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,089
Speaker 1: I am right here.

209
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,629
Speaker 0: I have to use a different incorrect adjective every time you're on the show.

210
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:26,030
Speaker 2: Based on the comic book by David Peterson, who's also not here.

211
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,830
Speaker 2: So he is eminent?

212
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,210
Speaker 1: If he's en route.

213
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:41,189
Speaker 0: And I believe when we talked about this before with you and Jared a while ago, you collaborated pretty closely on canon and things with him, at least in terms of how the game should feel and how it should work.

214
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,810
Speaker 1: Yes.

215
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,670
Speaker 1: The comic book author and I worked very closely together.

216
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,862
Speaker 1: I mean, I asked him all sorts of difficult questions like, "How do you get into the

217
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:50,205
Speaker 1: Mouseguard?".

218
00:10:50,952 --> 00:11:00,250
Speaker 1: And he gave me all sorts of difficult answers at 3 a.m But anyway, so the game, as we were talking about, has a turn structure to it.

219
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,029
Speaker 1: And the turn structure is, right, it's not I go, you go, I go, you go, per se.

220
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:12,910
Speaker 1: There's one turn in which basically the GM goes, and the GM gets to push two or more problems in your path.

221
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,430
Speaker 1: And basically it's two or more die rolls or series of die rolls.

222
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:21,710
Speaker 1: And it's supposed to be two in the game, but if things go wrong, it can spin out to more die rolls.

223
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:29,790
Speaker 1: And then in the player's turn, every player is guaranteed to get one die roll, basically one scene or action or something.

224
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,050
Speaker 1: And then there's ways for you to earn more screen time depending on how you play.

225
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,728
Speaker 0: So like on my turn, if I'm a player, then if I want to do something, I have to get one of these.

226
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,690
Speaker 1: Right, so you're, right, you don't, well, by default, you don't have to do anything.

227
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:51,449
Speaker 1: You're guaranteed to get to do one thing on your own of your choice, as you like it, per game.

228
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,910
Speaker 1: Which is new, like lots of games don't have that.

229
00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:01,010
Speaker 1: Lots of games, you might sit there for the whole session, lots of role-playing games, and you just, you maybe roll the die once or whatever, and you may not fail and do anything.

230
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,490
Speaker 1: But in Mouse Card, you're guaranteed to be able to do something.

231
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:18,470
Speaker 1: But you can increase your resources in the player's turn by characterizing yourself in the GM's turn, but you have to characterize yourself by putting yourself in danger.

232
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,870
Speaker 1: You have to show your character as vulnerable, flawed, or otherwise in trouble.

233
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,089
Speaker 1: And that gets you resources to use in the player's turn.

234
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,840
Speaker 0: You look like you're about to say something.

235
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:33,358
Speaker 2: No, not yet.

236
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,220
Speaker 0: So what kind of things do I want to do in my turn?

237
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,280
Speaker 0: We haven't talked a lot about mechanics or anything, but what are some things I would do?

238
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,259
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a role-playing game, so I could say I go meet with the Mistress Eleanor and talk about fancy pastries.

239
00:12:47,540 --> 00:13:02,000
Speaker 1: You could, and if you have Mistress Eleanor as a relationship, or you've met Mistress Eleanor in the game, you could do that, probably even without even having to spend one of your resources.

240
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,670
Speaker 0: So what do I get if I spend it?

241
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:05,120
Speaker 0: What's the point of spending it?

242
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:13,460
Speaker 1: Well, if there is no Mistress Eleanor, let's say your character's a cook, and you want to learn about making pastries, and you can do this in Mouseguard.

243
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,639
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be the strangest thing that's been done.

244
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:27,380
Speaker 1: You could actually bring Mistress Eleanor into the game, and that would cause you to spend one of these resources called a check, and that would allow you to test an ability in the game called circles, and circles is who your character knows.

245
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:31,240
Speaker 1: If you're successful in the test, then absolutely, you know a pastry chef named Mistress Eleanor.

246
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Speaker 1: Bring her in, and then she can instruct you in pastry cooking.

247
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:44,579
Speaker 1: More often, players will use these checks to recover from their hurts, or to build gear for future missions.

248
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:54,939
Speaker 1: Occasionally, a savvy GM will beat the players up really nice and hard in the GM's turn, but won't quite take them to the conclusion of their mission.

249
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,099
Speaker 1: So that's the GM's turn, and then in the player's turn, the players have to make a decision about what's more important to them.

250
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:06,940
Speaker 1: Recovering their own hurts, accomplishing their own agendas, or accomplishing the mission.

251
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,340
Speaker 1: And that is where the magic really happens in Mouseguard.

252
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:15,380
Speaker 1: That's where you get players making these great decisions, and they sacrifice themselves for the greater good of all Mousekind.

253
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:22,240
Speaker 2: So they would, on their own turn, try to complete the mission, but they didn't heal themselves, so they're totally screwed.

254
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,580
Speaker 0: Or they go help their brother, but now they didn't heal themselves, and now the mission's in jeopardy.

255
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:38,220
Speaker 1: Right, exactly, and all of those things have happened in games that I've played, and where that really shines, in a one-session game of Mouseguard, it's cool, you're like, "Oh, wow, I did this thing," right?

256
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:47,420
Speaker 1: But when you play the second session and you're still sick, your character's still sick because he was out in the cold and wet and rain, but you accomplish the mission anyway, that's when it really bites.

257
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,012
Speaker 1: That's when you're like, "Oh, now I need to work harder.

258
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,418
Speaker 1: I need to put myself in more jeopardy now, both because I'm sick and because now I need more resources to recover on my

259
00:14:58,478 --> 00:14:58,699
Speaker 1: turn.".

260
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:03,740
Speaker 2: Oh, see, if you earn more checks, then you could have gotten rid of your sickness and worked on the mission.

261
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,560
Speaker 0: Right, but then you would have hurt yourself in the previous, then things might have gone differently.

262
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,585
Speaker 0: Correct.

263
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:10,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're basically giving the GM more ammunition.

264
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,040
Speaker 1: The more you put yourself in jeopardy, the more potential ammunition you're giving the GM to introduce twists and to further screw you over.

265
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:21,640
Speaker 2: So I've got the flu, so now I need two checks, because I want to complete the mission and get rid of the flu.

266
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,560
Speaker 2: So in order to get a check, I put myself in danger and I break my leg.

267
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,860
Speaker 2: So now, even though I've got my extra check, I've got another problem.

268
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,234
Speaker 1: You're sick and you're injured, but there is a major but there.

269
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:44,819
Speaker 1: So if the GM decides that when you fail a test, he thinks it's right that your character would break his leg here, in that case, you succeed.

270
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,380
Speaker 1: If that's the mission-accomplishing test, you accomplish your mission.

271
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,939
Speaker 1: So the GM can't just punish you, punish you, punish you, punish you.

272
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:06,400
Speaker 1: Either you're going to get a twist introduced by the GM and your character is going to stay whole, confronting that twist, or you're going to get a condition in the form of hunger or fatigue or injury and you're going to succeed at what you were after.

273
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,800
Speaker 2: So when you get hurt, you still got what you wanted in exchange for getting hurt.

274
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of the part of the mouse guard ethos.

275
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,160
Speaker 1: You sacrifice yourself a little bit to accomplish the mission.

276
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,560
Speaker 0: To me, that's actually the biggest paradigm shift from, say, traditional D&D, because there, you've got hit points.

277
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,020
Speaker 0: Sacrificing 99% of your hit points doesn't have any game effect and you get all your hit points back pretty easily.

278
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,852
Speaker 2: Or even in Burning Wheel, I lost my foot.

279
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:30,417
Speaker 2: What did I get?

280
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:30,598
Speaker 2: Nothing.

281
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:32,280
Speaker 0: Well, that was your fault.

282
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:32,840
Speaker 2: I just lost my foot.

283
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,020
Speaker 0: You could have gotten something.

284
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,480
Speaker 1: Your game master clearly didn't read the adventure burner.

285
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:41,977
Speaker 2: Well, we got back to the village alive.

286
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,460
Speaker 2: I guess that counts as something.

287
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,640
Speaker 0: Scott, we march off into the Siberian wilderness to die with, like, one person with a B2 orientation.

288
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,832
Speaker 2: We didn't get lost and dead.

289
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:55,839
Speaker 0: Remember when Alex said, "Are you sure you want to trample off into the snowy

290
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,080
Speaker 0: woods?".

291
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,395
Speaker 2: Well, instead, "Okay, so stay still and

292
00:16:58,415 --> 00:16:58,717
Speaker 2: die.".

293
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,052
Speaker 0: Sure just fought that zombie.

294
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:02,180
Speaker 0: Anyway, we digress.

295
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:12,859
Speaker 0: But there weren't really mechanical consequences in D&D other than taking away gear or injuring someone, but injury was so temporary it never meant anything.

296
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,000
Speaker 0: Now it seems like you have to give up something, but there's a mechanical reward.

297
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:22,780
Speaker 0: I got hurt and I got what I wanted, as opposed to the soft game master makes something up.

298
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:29,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, it kind of always comes out that the game master makes something up, but in this case, we give the game master very strict rules to follow.

299
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 1: Right, and I guess you're right.

300
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:37,600
Speaker 1: When you talk about failure in this game, it's very different than most role-playing games.

301
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:41,380
Speaker 1: And, right, in D&D, failure can often be a full stop.

302
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:43,019
Speaker 1: It's not always a full stop.

303
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:51,420
Speaker 1: It is often a full stop, but in Mouseguard, it's either a new plot point is introduced, a twist, we call it, or you continue with the mission.

304
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:52,960
Speaker 1: You succeed, but you're at a cost.

305
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:02,890
Speaker 0: So I guess my point is, you put this in the rules of Mouseguard, where D&D doesn't really say what to do if you fail a diplomacy check other than you don't get what you wanted, and now what?

306
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,120
Speaker 0: The game master has to do something.

307
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:10,278
Speaker 1: I think in the Dungeon Master's Guide, too, there's advice on what to do when characters fail and how to keep things moving.

308
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,179
Speaker 2: If you buy all the extra books, then we'll tell you the real secrets.

309
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:24,820
Speaker 1: Right, but what this does in Mouseguard, though, is it keeps the pace of the game moving very quickly, and I feel like in a lot of role-playing games, if you have a story, it's an accident.

310
00:18:25,181 --> 00:18:27,039
Speaker 1: In Mouseguard, it's an eventuality.

311
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:33,760
Speaker 1: The way the mechanics interact with the way people play, it's going to create a narrative of some sort.

312
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,720
Speaker 1: I hope it's not the story that you expected.

313
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:40,520
Speaker 1: It's not what you planned out, but something is going to happen.

314
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,960
Speaker 1: There's going to be some kind of conflict and resolution.

315
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,680
Speaker 2: Did the idea for this system come from the Mouseguard comics?

316
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:58,500
Speaker 2: If you read those, that's pretty much how they go, is the mice want to do something, and they usually succeed to some extent with great, horrible sacrifice happening to them along the way.

317
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:04,559
Speaker 2: They don't ever succeed and not have any problems in pretty much any part of it.

318
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,439
Speaker 2: You don't just fight the crab and win.

319
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:11,139
Speaker 1: Right, you fight the crab and one of you dies, and the other one runs away.

320
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:21,879
Speaker 1: Well, if you look at my other big game, Burning Wheel, you can see that I didn't simply just take Burning Wheel and bolt Mouseguard on top of it.

321
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:30,748
Speaker 1: I took Burning Wheel, stripped away everything but some core mechanics to it, and then said, "Okay, what do we need here to really make this game represent

322
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:31,236
Speaker 1: Mouseguard?".

323
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,200
Speaker 1: I didn't want to make it a comic book game.

324
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:46,160
Speaker 1: I didn't want there to be paneling and gutters and inking and coloring or any kind of comic book-y terms, but at the same time, I wanted there to be a rhythm to the game that reflected the stories of the Mouseguard comics.

325
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,700
Speaker 0: Now we're getting into mechanism design.

326
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,799
Speaker 0: The rules of the game push people to create the exact kind of story you wanted them to create, even if they don't know where that actual story will go within that rubric.

327
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is a mechanism, and it is willfully designed.

328
00:19:59,025 --> 00:19:59,980
Speaker 2: Does it bother you?

329
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,979
Speaker 2: Some people are always like, "Oh, Mouseguard is like Baby Burning Wheel or Easy Burning

330
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:04,100
Speaker 2: Wheel.".

331
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,339
Speaker 2: Does it bother you when people say that?

332
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:07,260
Speaker 1: It used to really get under my skin.

333
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:10,480
Speaker 1: I don't really care anymore, but it's really not.

334
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,419
Speaker 1: It's its own game.

335
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:22,759
Speaker 1: Again, one of our design philosophies for Mouseguard was to strip Burning Wheel down to its core essentials and see what kind of game that was.

336
00:20:24,322 --> 00:20:28,939
Speaker 1: It's fun, but it's cool when you do that to a game, and you do this to any game.

337
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,220
Speaker 1: When you strip a game down to what you think are its core essentials, you're making a value judgment.

338
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,318
Speaker 1: You're deciding what the core essentials of the game are.

339
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:40,800
Speaker 1: Then when you start bolting other things on top of it, you're also making a value judgment as a designer.

340
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,499
Speaker 1: What's important to you about gameplay here?

341
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:46,392
Speaker 1: Ultimately, you're coming out with a different game, no matter what you say.

342
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:52,820
Speaker 1: Mouseguard, it's a cousin to Burning Wheel, but it's certainly not Burning Wheel's little brother.

343
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

344
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,153
Speaker 0: My experience, I played Burning Wheel, and I sat down with Mouseguard, flipped through the book, like, "Oh, it's like Burning Wheel.

345
00:20:59,194 --> 00:20:59,397
Speaker 0: I get

346
00:20:59,437 --> 00:20:59,559
Speaker 0: this.".

347
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,339
Speaker 0: Then we actually sat down to play, and I realized I really should have read that whole book.

348
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a couple things that catch players.

349
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,059
Speaker 1: Also, as you know from my games, you basically should read the rules and try to play it by the rules at least once.

350
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:18,269
Speaker 2: It's hard.

351
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,019
Speaker 2: There's a lot of rules.

352
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,325
Speaker 0: I always run into the side problem of a lot of role-playing.

353
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:26,818
Speaker 0: people will read the rules of a game, have never played it, and immediately modify it extensively before they play it.

354
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,059
Speaker 0: I don't know what to do about that.

355
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:32,919
Speaker 1: I spend a lot of time playtesting, designing and playtesting these games.

356
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,640
Speaker 1: I put a lot of effort, way more effort than I should into these games.

357
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:46,360
Speaker 0: I can imagine I played in a playtest of another game you were working on, and it was obviously rough around the edges, but obviously the crazy cool ideas were added and removed all the time, and you were taking notes on what players did.

358
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:55,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it really bugs me when somebody thinks that they can simply read one of my games, understand it completely, and then begin to modify it.

359
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,260
Speaker 0: Well, the metaphor I've used more and more when I argue with people like this is that if you go to a five-star French restaurant, there's one thing on the menu.

360
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:05,775
Speaker 0: If you ask the chef to make an alteration to that, he'll probably kick you out.

361
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:12,160
Speaker 0: Even if he changes it, you paid for a five-star meal from the guy who knows what he's doing.

362
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:13,859
Speaker 2: You don't put ketchup on it.

363
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,539
Speaker 2: There isn't even ketchup on the table.

364
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:17,518
Speaker 2: If you ask for ketchup, they'll just look at you funny.

365
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:23,000
Speaker 2: There is a chance it could be a fancy restaurant where the chef is no good.

366
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,938
Speaker 2: It exists, but it's not going to have a five-star on the door.

367
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,580
Speaker 2: Mouseguard won all kinds of awards.

368
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:32,916
Speaker 2: It basically is a five-star RPG.

369
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:37,140
Speaker 1: I guess it's a five-star RPG.

370
00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:38,268
Speaker 1: I don't know.

371
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:39,520
Speaker 1: I'm not qualified to say that.

372
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:40,638
Speaker 1: I don't even fancy French restaurants.

373
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,292
Speaker 0: We're semi-objective reviewers.

374
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:43,160
Speaker 0: I'll put it up there.

375
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,550
Speaker 0: Five stars.

376
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:45,780
Speaker 0: We didn't say out of how many.

377
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,870
Speaker 2: It definitely gets five stars for nothing else.

378
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,319
Speaker 2: If you don't want to give it five stars for the game, the physicalness of it is... I can't even think of another game that says...

379
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,860
Speaker 0: Tell us a little bit about that, because the game was first published.

380
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,259
Speaker 0: It was a book, and then there were some rumors, and then a box came out with little mouse figures just like were in the comic.

381
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,540
Speaker 0: The thing that, when I read the book, the first thing I said was, "I want to play Mouseguard with those things in the comic,".

382
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:10,519
Speaker 0: and then the box appeared.

383
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:12,071
Speaker 1: Yes.

384
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:12,900
Speaker 1: That was my idea.

385
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:23,179
Speaker 1: It was actually my idea from the get-go, was to make Mouseguard, in addition to a game, a product so that one might make money from it, though that is a myth.

386
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:25,719
Speaker 1: That one makes money from good products.

387
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,309
Speaker 1: One does not make money from there.

388
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,340
Speaker 1: One makes money by fleecing one's customers.

389
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:30,914
Speaker 2: That is true.

390
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:40,479
Speaker 1: Anyway, the box set was something that David Pearson and I worked on, along with the publisher, Arcaya.

391
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:45,288
Speaker 1: I wasn't sold.

392
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:46,640
Speaker 1: It's funny.

393
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,749
Speaker 1: It was my idea.

394
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:48,720
Speaker 1: The publisher got on board.

395
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,406
Speaker 1: They started pushing me, and I was like, "Yeah, you know what?

396
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:50,852
Speaker 1: This sucks.

397
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:51,439
Speaker 1: I don't want to do this.

398
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:52,625
Speaker 1: This is

399
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:53,010
Speaker 1: crappy.".

400
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:59,199
Speaker 1: I went through with it, and it came out pretty good.

401
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:04,649
Speaker 0: When I bring out the book, people are like, "Ooh and ah," but when I show them the box, they're like, "What's that?

402
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,297
Speaker 0: I want to play

403
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:05,377
Speaker 0: it.".

404
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:07,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's been definitely gaining momentum.

405
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,979
Speaker 1: People at PAX seem to really like it.

406
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:17,080
Speaker 1: It has a little toy factor to it, like you said, with the mouse pieces and the map and whatnot, which are meant to mimic the comics.

407
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,298
Speaker 1: Peterson did the sculpts for the dice and the mouse figures.

408
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,313
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.

409
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:25,339
Speaker 2: His sculpture is crazy.

410
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:26,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a little craftsman.

411
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,160
Speaker 1: We had to send a little model of the mouse figure to the factory.

412
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:41,060
Speaker 1: We did want the colors on the pieces to be a little more muted, a little more natural, but it's hard.

413
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:49,300
Speaker 1: The manufacturing process was very difficult, and without doing extensive sampling on the plastics, we took what we could get.

414
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, having seen some recent experience from similar projects to doing similar kinds of manufacturing.

415
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,980
Speaker 0: At the scale we all do manufacturing, it is not easy to get what you want without paying a lot of money.

416
00:24:59,303 --> 00:24:59,840
Speaker 2: Or going to China.

417
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,680
Speaker 0: No, even if you go to China, you'll get 10 proofs back that are interesting.

418
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,240
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, unless you physically go to the factory in China.

419
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,239
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying, yeah.

420
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:19,079
Speaker 1: So yeah, Mousecart, it comes with cards and custom dice, character sheets and a GM sheet, my friend, that includes on the back, includes a cheat sheet for all the rules.

421
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:19,465
Speaker 1: Oh.

422
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:20,500
Speaker 0: Very important.

423
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,080
Speaker 1: Very important.

424
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,398
Speaker 1: And a GM screen, which I use pretty extensively myself.

425
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,960
Speaker 0: I need one of those for Burning Wheel.

426
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:27,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

427
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:28,619
Speaker 1: It's hard, though.

428
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,420
Speaker 0: What are you going to put on it?

429
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:35,300
Speaker 0: I had this DVD one that was three fold-out panels that were separate, and each one had nine sides.

430
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:35,938
Speaker 0: It was duh.

431
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

432
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:36,951
Speaker 1: Wow.

433
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:40,040
Speaker 1: I've made a Burning Wheel screen before.

434
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:53,560
Speaker 1: I digress on this one, but my only problem with a Burning Wheel screen, and maybe the listeners out there in TV land can give me some advice, I just don't want to scream between me and my players when I play Burning Wheel.

435
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:54,180
Speaker 1: It's inappropriate.

436
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,156
Speaker 0: True, because you don't have the hidden dice like you do in every other game.

437
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,757
Speaker 0: The game master's not rolling secretly and being like, "He hits

438
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:00,959
Speaker 0: you.".

439
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,047
Speaker 2: But you can just do a mat, right?

440
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,780
Speaker 2: It goes out, right?

441
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,661
Speaker 2: Because you don't have miniatures walking around a board, so you can just put it in the middle of the table flat, and it has all the charts on it, and you can-- Hey,

442
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:14,981
Speaker 0: if it's on the table, then we're going to say the thing, "You

443
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:15,493
Speaker 1: know what you should

444
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:15,718
Speaker 1: do?".

445
00:26:16,926 --> 00:26:17,360
Speaker 1: All right, Jerry.

446
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,018
Speaker 2: What should I do?

447
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:18,838
Speaker 2: It's your favorite.

448
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:21,696
Speaker 0: No, but there's cool stuff if you do something like that.

449
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:22,840
Speaker 1: I asked.

450
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:31,719
Speaker 1: The problem with a mat, and we did a rules reference sheet for Burning Wheel Revised, and the problem with that and the mat is that they get buried.

451
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:34,780
Speaker 0: On their Cheetos and Mountain Dew and everyone's books.

452
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,000
Speaker 1: Dice and books, yeah.

453
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:48,019
Speaker 0: Though with the mouse guard, the thing that really helped was that I realized, once I opened the box, that whenever we played, everyone had their books open to those maps on the insides of the covers, because they needed to refer to them all the time.

454
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:52,460
Speaker 0: So everyone bent the covers of their books just to have them open like that.

455
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,400
Speaker 0: So the box set with the mat in it, that saved my books.

456
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,440
Speaker 1: You know that the dust cover came with a map on the back, right?

457
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, dust cover was lost right away.

458
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:09,180
Speaker 2: I got to say, I don't know much about publishing, but I know dust covers is some of the most expensive things in publishing.

459
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:12,680
Speaker 2: They cost a lot of monies, and I really don't like dust covers.

460
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,619
Speaker 2: I wish they never existed.

461
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,220
Speaker 2: I just want to get rid of them.

462
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:19,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was against the dust cover for mouse guard.

463
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:20,577
Speaker 1: I advocated against it.

464
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:23,354
Speaker 2: And even the cover has the same art on it too, right?

465
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if we were going to do a dust cover, then I wanted to do a separate, more of a graphic cover of the actual book.

466
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:35,340
Speaker 1: But I went with David and Mark on their judgment on that one, and it's fine.

467
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,720
Speaker 1: The dust cover actually has some utility to it.

468
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,358
Speaker 1: It has a funny picture of me on it.

469
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:41,580
Speaker 1: It's cool.

470
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,197
Speaker 2: I forgot about that.

471
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,259
Speaker 1: It has a picture of me eating pizza on it.

472
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,600
Speaker 0: So what's going to kill a mouse?

473
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,560
Speaker 0: How much death is there in mouse guard?

474
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,320
Speaker 1: Do you want to hear a horrible mouse guard death story?

475
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:56,339
Speaker 2: Tell us your role-playing game stories.

476
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:59,419
Speaker 1: So my character was walking in the woods.

477
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:06,220
Speaker 1: I was in Canada a couple years ago in Montreal for a small gaming event.

478
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,879
Speaker 1: I was there with Vincent and Joshua and Rob Bull.

479
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:16,440
Speaker 1: I was playing mouse guard with a group of people, and one of the people with whom I was playing was a young girl.

480
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:18,020
Speaker 1: I think she was about nine.

481
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:20,700
Speaker 1: If I'm not mistaken, her father was an avid gamer.

482
00:28:21,862 --> 00:28:23,779
Speaker 1: Sorry, her father came up, handed her off to me.

483
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,419
Speaker 1: So this is her first gaming session.

484
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,560
Speaker 1: Maybe she had read the comics or something, but her dad was a gamer.

485
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:33,560
Speaker 2: Does her dad know who you were, or she just looked at the schedule?

486
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,619
Speaker 0: Found some stranger to come?

487
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,367
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

488
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:36,119
Speaker 1: He knew who I was.

489
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:39,480
Speaker 1: She wanted to play mouse guard, if I'm not mistaken.

490
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,138
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we get into it.

491
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:48,698
Speaker 1: She's a little shy at first, as some people are, but eventually she's in there, and it comes down to it.

492
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:51,980
Speaker 1: In the final scenario, there were mice in jeopardy.

493
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,199
Speaker 1: There was probably a mouse caravan that was stopped.

494
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,319
Speaker 1: Mice in jeopardy.

495
00:28:56,422 --> 00:29:00,180
Speaker 1: I think even the mouse guard themselves were kind of pinned down by a killer shrike.

496
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:03,299
Speaker 1: As you saw, by a shrike.

497
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:06,060
Speaker 1: She went toe-to-toe with it.

498
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:18,939
Speaker 1: While the other mouse guard were getting everyone to safety, she went toe-to-toe with the shrike, duking it out, battling, carried off into the air, swinging away, lost her sword, and lost the conflict.

499
00:29:20,945 --> 00:29:22,140
Speaker 1: I didn't think I had a chance in hell.

500
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:25,439
Speaker 1: I think she even had help from her friends, because I think that was part of the conflict.

501
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,338
Speaker 2: Throwing some rocks.

502
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:29,079
Speaker 1: They were trying to escape, and I was trying to kill her.

503
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:33,579
Speaker 1: They were shooting bows and throwing rocks and screaming and whatnot.

504
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:36,939
Speaker 1: So yeah, the shrike.

505
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:45,060
Speaker 1: We all knew exactly what had happened when the dice hit the table, and this silence, a silent explosion.

506
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:46,559
Speaker 1: Everyone stopped and looked.

507
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,546
Speaker 1: I looked at her.

508
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:48,840
Speaker 1: She turned bright pink.

509
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:55,238
Speaker 1: Because I'm a bad man, I described the shrike impaling her on a thorn, as shrikes do.

510
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:56,560
Speaker 1: That's how they kill their prey.

511
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,139
Speaker 1: They impale them and then save them for later.

512
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:02,019
Speaker 1: She turned pink and then got sad.

513
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,000
Speaker 1: The other players were really cool.

514
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,579
Speaker 1: They had a little funeral for her character.

515
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,549
Speaker 0: That's a great story.

516
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,339
Speaker 0: That's not horrible.

517
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:13,100
Speaker 1: She really liked the funeral.

518
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:15,540
Speaker 1: They even all made something for her funeral.

519
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:16,460
Speaker 1: They crafted something.

520
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,220
Speaker 1: All your characters have crafty skills in Mouseguard.

521
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:25,673
Speaker 1: You could tell that by the end of it, when I took her back to her dad, I was like, "We ended a little

522
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:25,897
Speaker 1: early."

523
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,498
Speaker 1: Because she died.

524
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:30,599
Speaker 1: And by "died," I mean I killed her in a horrible way.

525
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:39,000
Speaker 1: She was a little crestfallen, but she definitely seemed proud of herself, that she had sacrificed herself for the guard.

526
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,318
Speaker 0: But Mouseguard is a game that can be dark and super serious for people who want it to be.

527
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,399
Speaker 1: I personally, and no one agrees with me on this, I think Mouseguard is the darkest fantasy game out there.

528
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:57,500
Speaker 1: If you really get down there on the ground with the mice, you're in the most horrific fantasy world ever.

529
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,368
Speaker 1: There's no magic.

530
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,520
Speaker 1: There's no salvation.

531
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:02,599
Speaker 1: Everything wants to either eat you or eat the things you eat.

532
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:08,980
Speaker 1: There's nothing beneath you on the food chain.

533
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:12,380
Speaker 2: Even your non-magical powers are pretty weak, right?

534
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,100
Speaker 2: No one's really super strong or super fast or super anything.

535
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:18,106
Speaker 1: Right.

536
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:22,300
Speaker 1: As a player in the Mouseguard, you can build up some pretty killer resources and you can muster a lot of dice.

537
00:31:22,824 --> 00:31:24,960
Speaker 1: And you can put a herd on a wolf.

538
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:29,279
Speaker 1: You can't kill a wolf outright, but you can definitely drive it off.

539
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,297
Speaker 1: But it takes a lot of gamesmanship to get there.

540
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,480
Speaker 1: But just the world in and of itself, right?

541
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:39,780
Speaker 1: Your mice, everything else is bigger than you.

542
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,669
Speaker 1: Everything wants to eat you.

543
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,438
Speaker 1: You can't kill them.

544
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:46,536
Speaker 1: Not without some serious mouse science or mouse military action going on.

545
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:52,199
Speaker 1: I just think it's really bleak and dark, but nobody agrees with me.

546
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:54,640
Speaker 2: I never really thought about it that way.

547
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:59,300
Speaker 2: You think about games that have a dark theme, like Apocalypse World or something.

548
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,419
Speaker 0: But then I'm a badass with eight guns.

549
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:01,882
Speaker 2: Exactly.

550
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:04,020
Speaker 2: It's a scary, dark, horrible place.

551
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,099
Speaker 2: Or maybe vampire games.

552
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:07,520
Speaker 2: Everything's black.

553
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,311
Speaker 2: The cover of the book is black.

554
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:10,380
Speaker 2: All the text is black.

555
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,920
Speaker 2: And it's supposed to be dark.

556
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,200
Speaker 2: But actually, you're a superhero.

557
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,759
Speaker 2: You're somehow a badass in some sort of way to escape some sort of danger.

558
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:27,440
Speaker 1: I temper the darkness in Mouseguard with recognizing that the comics are a heroic journey.

559
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:32,920
Speaker 1: And that the world is against the heroes in this, but that's how they prove themselves heroes.

560
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,080
Speaker 1: And you prove yourself a hero in the game both by how you live and by how you die.

561
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,739
Speaker 0: Well, it feels very medieval, which kind of fits the sort of bleak "we are at the bottom and everything's out to kill

562
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:44,840
Speaker 0: us.".

563
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:47,160
Speaker 0: I guess that's how a peasant would feel in the Middle Ages.

564
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:51,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, depending on... Maybe 100 Years War France.

565
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:55,299
Speaker 0: I'm talking early Middle Ages, before things started to solidify.

566
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,419
Speaker 1: It wasn't always Monty Python.

567
00:32:58,421 --> 00:32:59,639
Speaker 1: It wasn't always Monty Python.

568
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,100
Speaker 0: I'm talking the year 850.

569
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,781
Speaker 1: People had nice lives in the year 850.

570
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:05,839
Speaker 0: Some mice have nice lives.

571
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:10,019
Speaker 2: The ones that stay in town and never leave.

572
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,498
Speaker 0: The ones who don't join the Guard.

573
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,498
Speaker 2: Yeah, the big town.

574
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:16,480
Speaker 1: The other thing that's out to get you is the weather, too.

575
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:19,200
Speaker 1: There are rules where everything is out to get you.

576
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,840
Speaker 1: The weather, the environment, the animals, everything.

577
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:21,959
Speaker 1: Even your other mice.

578
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:25,900
Speaker 0: That was when it really sunk in, when I was looking at the Game Master section on my turn.

579
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,751
Speaker 0: It was like, "What can I do to

580
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:26,975
Speaker 0: them?".

581
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,515
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Have it

582
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:28,818
Speaker 0: rain.".

583
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:30,599
Speaker 0: And I kind of thought about, "Wait a minute, yeah.

584
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,777
Speaker 0: Rain is kind of a big deal for a

585
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:33,020
Speaker 0: mouse.".

586
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,200
Speaker 2: Yeah, they go inside and they don't come out, and they got to make sure that the inside isn't a flooding inside.

587
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:37,960
Speaker 1: Right, right.

588
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,620
Speaker 1: And I love that about the comics.

589
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,220
Speaker 1: That's, I think, maybe my favorite thing about the comics.

590
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,539
Speaker 1: Like when it snows?

591
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,079
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's the matter of perspective.

592
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:49,800
Speaker 1: And if you really get down there, it's a really imaginative universe.

593
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:57,056
Speaker 1: When you're looking at it from the forest floor, you're looking at what a leaf, what a twig, what a tiny rivulet of rain is to us, what it means to them.

594
00:33:58,626 --> 00:33:59,179
Speaker 1: I like that.

595
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:09,739
Speaker 1: I like that perspective, and I feel like it gives a lot of role-playing opportunities in that it creates the necessary disassociation so that you can really imagine.

596
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,960
Speaker 1: You can really get in there and you can, as people, we can identify with these problems.

597
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,760
Speaker 1: Because that's the weird thing about Avatar Association.

598
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,219
Speaker 1: If it's too close, it's hard for us to identify.

599
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:25,040
Speaker 1: But we create just the right amount of space, and you can get in there and kind of fill up that space with your imagination.

600
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:26,300
Speaker 2: It's like in Arrietty, right?

601
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,520
Speaker 2: And in Arrietty, they really concentrate on all the small things as tiny people.

602
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:36,600
Speaker 2: But it's in contrast to the real, full-size people living in the house, so there's always this sort of connection going on, right?

603
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:42,579
Speaker 2: Where as opposed to if it's just mice, you're just getting the small world and you're not thinking about the big world at all.

604
00:34:42,902 --> 00:34:43,038
Speaker 1: Right.

605
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,340
Speaker 1: - Right, yeah.

606
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:46,199
Speaker 1: David was very explicit when we designed the game.

607
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,699
Speaker 1: No humans, no cats, no rats.

608
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,120
Speaker 1: So basically all the kind of products of humanity.

609
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,259
Speaker 1: I imagine no dogs either, now that I think about it.

610
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:54,739
Speaker 0: - Makes sense.

611
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,560
Speaker 0: So we've got the big, great elder Cthulhu Moose who will come by occasionally.

612
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,316
Speaker 1: - Yes, oh yes.

613
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:00,318
Speaker 1: Moose God.

614
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:02,939
Speaker 1: He'll journey through the territories once in a while.

615
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,234
Speaker 1: That was a really fun mission.

616
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:04,660
Speaker 1: I ran once.

617
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,220
Speaker 1: I had a springtime mission, a herd of moose coming.

618
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,815
Speaker 1: - A herd?

619
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:09,695
Speaker 1: - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

620
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,940
Speaker 1: A big family of them or whatever were coming.

621
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,219
Speaker 1: And Gwendolyn's like, divert them.

622
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,380
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

623
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,140
Speaker 2: - How about I just hide and wait for them to pass?

624
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,620
Speaker 0: - Well what if they're headed straight for your town?

625
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,458
Speaker 1: - Well no, no, no.

626
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,119
Speaker 1: Because with the spring moose comes calves and with calves come wolves.

627
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,577
Speaker 1: And wolves eat mice.

628
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Speaker 1: Especially hungry wolves.

629
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:30,830
Speaker 1: So yeah, that was.

630
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:32,038
Speaker 1: the mission was to get out there and divert them.

631
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,899
Speaker 2: - How is a mouse gonna divert a moose?

632
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,297
Speaker 1: - They did it.

633
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:43,580
Speaker 1: I think they actually used the wolves that were chasing the mooses to divert them.

634
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,338
Speaker 1: To chase them off.

635
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,560
Speaker 0: - That's a pretty dangerous ally.

636
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,040
Speaker 1: - It was a really intense mission.

637
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,800
Speaker 1: - That's big time.

638
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,600
Speaker 1: - That was deep into our mouse guard run.

639
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,240
Speaker 1: It was deep into the campaign.

640
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,599
Speaker 2: - How often, if I was gonna do a full mouse guard campaign, how many sessions do you usually go?

641
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:04,400
Speaker 1: - I would recommend playing no less than four.

642
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,800
Speaker 1: If you're gonna sit down, if you're gonna buy the book and you're gonna get your friends together, play four sessions of mouse guard.

643
00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:14,300
Speaker 1: And if you like it, if you're into it and your characters are starting to develop, I would go eight to 12.

644
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,380
Speaker 1: Most of my games are built for eight to 12 sessions to really sing.

645
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,879
Speaker 2: - That's usually the length, that's as long as we can get a campaign to go.

646
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,281
Speaker 2: -

647
00:36:23,301 --> 00:36:41,477
Speaker 0: Well that's the biggest problem I've had with so-called indie RPGs or non-indie in general is that most people only have the convention experience of the one-off or the one-off, they play the game for their friends to get them into it, but they never get, like Free Market, a lot of people never get the next session when you kind of realize how you're advancing and how you're changing.

648
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,320
Speaker 2: - Yeah, it's something I've noticed is that when I run the Free Market and they sort of realize it's just one session, they burn everything.

649
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,919
Speaker 0: - Burning Wheel, all that earth is gone at the end of that one-off.

650
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,459
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I know, I know.

651
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:54,480
Speaker 1: It's a problem, my games are built for long-term play.

652
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,100
Speaker 2: - Right, and it's like I like that, but it's so hard, it's hard for most people to get one-off play, let alone long-term play.

653
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,320
Speaker 1: - I know, I know, but I'm a fanatic about the medium, so.

654
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,529
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

655
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,379
Speaker 2: - I mean, it's like I want it too, but it's just, it's hard to get people to show up.

656
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,940
Speaker 1: - I know, I agree.

657
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,460
Speaker 0: - I think everyone will show up tomorrow.

658
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,900
Speaker 1: - But it's easy to get everyone to sit around and talk into their Xbox Live headsets.

659
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,491
Speaker 1: Weird.

660
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,520
Speaker 2: - Yeah, right?

661
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,479
Speaker 2: - You need to make an RPG for the Xbox Live.

662
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:27,619
Speaker 0: - We could argue all that, the physicality of at least this kind of role-playing game, I think, is a big part of it, and it'd be hard to replicate that.

663
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,259
Speaker 1: - Oh, I agree.

664
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,020
Speaker 0: - Short of like some sort of future sense where you have a table where it kind of like projects images of everyone around it.

665
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:35,676
Speaker 0: And there's a shared space that you have.

666
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,439
Speaker 1: - I mean, even rolling dice, right?

667
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:49,040
Speaker 2: It's like you can roll dice on the computer, but rolling, you know, having the dice in your hand, you know, the person gives you the helping dice, the whole thing, you can't, you know, everyone looking in the dice pit as they turn over.

668
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:58,300
Speaker 0: You make a big deal in multiple games about if you're helping, you physically hand them the die, like it has to be, 'cause then you can even see, like if you roll, if that die helped or not.

669
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:06,860
Speaker 1: - Right, also, I think one of the core components of my designs is that I recognize that there are people sitting around a table playing these games, and I want the people to be interacting.

670
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:20,400
Speaker 1: When I demoed the game for Mike of Penny Arcade at PAX, and I demonstrated the helping rules to them, and at first, they were like, you know, at first, they'd never seen anything like that, so at first, of course, oh, that's weird.

671
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:25,379
Speaker 1: One or two rolls with the helping, they were like, oh, I get it, that's cool.

672
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,320
Speaker 1: And then we didn't even have the multicolored dice, I just had one set of dice, and they were just passing.

673
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:44,180
Speaker 1: Just because, I mean, we're physical creatures, and so when you get that experience of, you know, I am telling you what I'm doing, I'm saying I'm helping, but then I'm handing you something, you get the experience that you're, it's the illusion of the experience that you're actually helping.

674
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:46,398
Speaker 1: It really works.

675
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,859
Speaker 0: - I think everyone in their head when they hand it is thinking, with my ax.

676
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,419
Speaker 1: - Well, maybe, I hope not.

677
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,260
Speaker 1: Gimli, not my favorite part of those movies.

678
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,720
Speaker 2: - I just watched them like yesterday.

679
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:03,730
Speaker 1: (laughing) - Whatever, anyway.

680
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:13,969
Speaker 2: - So if there's someone out there, right, you know, regardless of RPG level experience, and they wanna play some mouse guard, right, what should they do besides obviously buy it?

681
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,369
Speaker 2: Like, what should, like, their first thing that they should do?

682
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,570
Speaker 0: - Other than read it, I guess.

683
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,910
Speaker 2: - Yeah, reading, buying, okay.

684
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,629
Speaker 1: - Well, you can read the rules, I mean, I recommend the box set, I think the box set is actually easier to learn than the book.

685
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:29,527
Speaker 2: - Is the box set still able to be gotten?

686
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,270
Speaker 1: - It is, it is still in print.

687
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,806
Speaker 1: - That's good, cool.

688
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,627
Speaker 1: - It is still out there.

689
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:46,550
Speaker 1: So I recommend the box set because the cards make everything visual, the dice really make everything very clear, and the character sheet for the square character sheet and then the square GM sheet have all the rules of the game on them between the two of them.

690
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,810
Speaker 2: - Yeah, I like how they're the same size as the mouse guard comics.

691
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,150
Speaker 2: - Yeah.

692
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,749
Speaker 2: - It's really cool.

693
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,569
Speaker 1: - If you're gonna do it, you gotta do it.

694
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,908
Speaker 1: - Right.

695
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,210
Speaker 1: - Anyway, honestly, I recommend sitting down with a friend and doing a one on one mission.

696
00:39:56,714 --> 00:39:58,870
Speaker 1: I am much, I'm more and more a fan of this.

697
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,470
Speaker 1: The more I play and the more I do them myself, I love one on one missions.

698
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,706
Speaker 1: I'm in the middle of doing a burning wheel one on one with one of my friends right now and I love it.

699
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:22,908
Speaker 1: And mouse guard, you're not gonna get the full synergy of all the helping rules and conflicts and stuff are gonna be hard, so start easy, don't go crazy, and just do a very simple mouse guard mission as kind of a trainer and then you two go and advocate the game to the rest of your group.

700
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,387
Speaker 1: Much easier to advocate, we have learned, when you have a wingman.

701
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,055
Speaker 1: And when it's just the crazy GM being like, "I got a new

702
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:29,580
Speaker 1: game."

703
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:33,098
Speaker 1: Nobody ever is like, "Yeah, whatever, just come on, "where's the

704
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:33,200
Speaker 1: D&D?".

705
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:38,363
Speaker 1: But when it's people on both sides of the screen going, "Come on, we should try

706
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:38,525
Speaker 1: this."

707
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,350
Speaker 1: Things go much easier.

708
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,127
Speaker 2: - Oh, that's a--.

709
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,823
Speaker 0: - I never thought of the solo, 'cause the mere thought of a solo D&D game just like gives me goosebumps of dread.

710
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,514
Speaker 2: - I mean, it's like you.

711
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:51,310
Speaker 2: think about any one on one RPG and it always seems like an awkward thing to do.

712
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,789
Speaker 2: Like it's technically you can do it, but it always seems like a weird thing, right?

713
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,649
Speaker 1: - What's weird about it?

714
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,489
Speaker 2: - I don't know, it just seems like, imagine like me and Rim were sitting here, it's like, okay, Rim, you're the GM and it's me.

715
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,428
Speaker 0: It's like, uh-- - All right, the dragon's about to eat your mom, what you doing?

716
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,009
Speaker 2: - Ah, shit, oh.

717
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,250
Speaker 2: I guess, how powerful am I?

718
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,350
Speaker 2: Am I gonna fight this dragon or am I gonna run the hell away?

719
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:18,870
Speaker 0: - I guess for me, what would make it awkward is that when there's at least one other player there, there's always that ability to retreat from the baleful gaze of the game master.

720
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:23,870
Speaker 0: Like the story is looking at you, you can always like kinda look away and then the other player might say something.

721
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:29,289
Speaker 0: But when it's just you and me, then you say you present a situation and there is nobody to speak but me.

722
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:37,530
Speaker 1: - Well, yes, and that's I think a feature of solo play is that there's no downtime, so it's very intense.

723
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:46,029
Speaker 1: You play a lot faster, but at the same time, the GM hopefully will learn rather quickly not to be a fucking dick.

724
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,314
Speaker 0: - Ah.

725
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:52,190
Speaker 1: - Because I'm a very, very generous GM as a solo GM.

726
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:54,750
Speaker 1: I like to talk, I like to bandy ideas back and forth.

727
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,707
Speaker 2: - When it's not solo, watch out.

728
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,190
Speaker 1: (laughing) - I don't play another character or anything like that.

729
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,670
Speaker 1: I'm not like, I'm not GMing myself.

730
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,110
Speaker 1: - Right.

731
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,350
Speaker 1: - But no, no, no, but right.

732
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:04,530
Speaker 1: But no, I see what you're saying.

733
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:10,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes, but when I have five people at the table, you're like, what are you, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.

734
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:12,730
Speaker 1: And I'm just like, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

735
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:13,246
Speaker 1: What did you wanna do?

736
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:13,970
Speaker 1: What did you say?

737
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,610
Speaker 1: Okay, now it's your turn.

738
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:22,682
Speaker 1: Right, just 'cause you get people, human beings only have so much ego shielding.

739
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:29,409
Speaker 1: We can only kind of be patient for so long before we start telling people to shut the fuck up.

740
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,289
Speaker 2: - Maybe we should try that, Ryan.

741
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,688
Speaker 0: - You wanna try it?

742
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,470
Speaker 2: - I don't know, just pick some game and do, what?

743
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:58,889
Speaker 1: - Well, the thing that I believe where my games are very strong in this is that they can be very personal and you can do a really cool personal story and it's not just about basically getting lucky, rolling some numbers, defeating a monster or whatever, but you're playing out, accomplishing a goal or a belief or something like that.

744
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,949
Speaker 1: So it feels natural that you're always on 'cause suddenly you're the protagonist in the story.

745
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:06,029
Speaker 1: It's about you, it's about this thing now.

746
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,548
Speaker 1: So yeah, try it, you guys.

747
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,168
Speaker 2: - I think we should, yeah.

748
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,547
Speaker 1: - So yeah, so all right, so thanks for having me on the show, guys.

749
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,809
Speaker 0: - It's always a pleasure, we gotta hang out more.

750
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,728
Speaker 0: - Like right down the street.

751
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,649
Speaker 1: - Man, I forgot to bring your DVD that I borrowed a year ago.

752
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,611
Speaker 2: - Oh, they were 11?

753
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:22,190
Speaker 2: Did you watch that?

754
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:22,649
Speaker 2: - I did.

755
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,309
Speaker 2: - Did you like it?

756
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,490
Speaker 1: - I did, I liked it a lot.

757
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:26,290
Speaker 1: I still haven't figured out how to make a game out of it.

758
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:26,392
Speaker 1: - I

759
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:26,678
Speaker 0: know, we've

760
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:27,127
Speaker 2: tried forever.

761
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,089
Speaker 2: - Well, I know at least we need a big red button in the middle of the table.

762
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:31,510
Speaker 2: Any other part of the game, I don't know.

763
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,730
Speaker 1: - I know, I'm trying to go with that constraint and I don't know.

764
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,570
Speaker 2: - But do you see how you want it to be a game?

765
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,530
Speaker 2: Like you wanna be in that situation.

766
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,888
Speaker 1: - Well, part of me is like, well, let's just make it like a deep form LARP or something and we'll--.

767
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,430
Speaker 2: - That's not a bad idea.

768
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:56,350
Speaker 1: - And just, 'cause you could make it so you could only play once, but then you could also make it Battlestar Galactica E and make it, you know.

769
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:04,130
Speaker 0: - I'm really down on those Battlestar Galactica E games 'cause they all have, like Shadows Ever Camelot and all of them have this horrible mechanic of.

770
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:12,850
Speaker 0: you can kind of say what you've got in your hand, but you can't explicitly say it and the rules are just so mushy that I can't, like I rage when I read those like that.

771
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,470
Speaker 2: - Yeah, they're unenforceable BS rules, you know.

772
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,750
Speaker 0: - It should either be silent or you can say anything.

773
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:18,590
Speaker 1: - Interesting.

774
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,009
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'll bring that DVD back soon.

775
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:23,629
Speaker 2: - Yeah, sure.

776
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,449
Speaker 1: - The, anyway.

777
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:27,990
Speaker 1: - Blah, blah, blah.

778
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,330
Speaker 1: - Well, at least I didn't fumble during the interview.

779
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:30,829
Speaker 1: - Whatever.

780
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,650
Speaker 1: - Anyway, I will be with you guys at Kineticon.

781
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:34,390
Speaker 2: - Oh, nice.

782
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:40,209
Speaker 0: - Yeah, Kineticon, we'll schedule him wherever he wants to be, so if you guys wanna see Luke Crane doing stuff.

783
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,548
Speaker 1: - I am really excited to run the panels.

784
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:45,110
Speaker 1: I ran at PAX East at Kineticon.

785
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,410
Speaker 1: I'm gonna run my Intro to Burning Wheel panel.

786
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,008
Speaker 1: - Oh, that's good.

787
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,290
Speaker 1: - Complete with gorgeous illustrations and slideshow.

788
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:51,723
Speaker 1: - Ooh.

789
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,682
Speaker 1: - And I am going to run the D&D You Never Knew panel, which is about the 1981 edition of D&D.

790
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,429
Speaker 0: - I really wanted to go to that, actually.

791
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,270
Speaker 2: - So wait, I'm always confused about the different colors, right?

792
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,390
Speaker 2: So I have the one, we got it at a Goodwill store in Rochester.

793
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:09,250
Speaker 2: It's three boxes, red, green, blue.

794
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,969
Speaker 2: Is that the one you're talking about, or are you talking about a different one?

795
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:18,549
Speaker 2: - You have three red-- - You have three boxes, one's red, and that's box one, then there's green is box two, and blue is box three.

796
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,170
Speaker 1: - It's actually red is one, blue is two, green is three.

797
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,890
Speaker 2: - The green and the blue might be backwards.

798
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,350
Speaker 2: Red is definitely box number one.

799
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 1: - That's probably the 1983 edition.

800
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,770
Speaker 2: - So it's not the one you're talking about?

801
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,149
Speaker 1: - It is not.

802
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:32,530
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the one before that.

803
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,549
Speaker 2: - So is that the little tiny box?

804
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,262
Speaker 1: - No, no, it was a box set.

805
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:43,015
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was, yeah, it was a box set, and it was the red box and blue box, but there was a red box and blue box before.

806
00:45:43,055 --> 00:45:44,069
Speaker 1: there was a red box and blue box.

807
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:45,389
Speaker 2: - Okay, all right.

808
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,929
Speaker 1: - So it's not the pink box or the white box?

809
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,050
Speaker 1: - You're gonna have to come to the lecture.

810
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,090
Speaker 1: I explained it all.

811
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,630
Speaker 1: I have slides, I have a little timeline.

812
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:54,670
Speaker 2: - We should put this on YouTube.

813
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,830
Speaker 1: - If you want to record it, that's fine.

814
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,425
Speaker 0: - We'll video it.

815
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:02,050
Speaker 1: - Anyway, so I'm excited to see you guys at Kineticon, and then I'll see you again at PAX Prime.

816
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:03,428
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah, PAX Prime.

817
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,449
Speaker 1: - Just booked my booth today.

818
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,667
Speaker 0: - Very nice.

819
00:46:06,935 --> 00:46:09,288
Speaker 0: We're putting together, what we're gonna lecture on there.

820
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:13,189
Speaker 2: - Are you working on any games that you're free to talk about?

821
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,070
Speaker 2: I mean, you must be working on something, right?

822
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:20,530
Speaker 1: - We are working on a bunch of stuff at Burning Wheel headquarters, and we are neck deep in play testing.

823
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,210
Speaker 1: We've made some really, really cool discoveries rules-wise.

824
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,390
Speaker 2: - Ooh, discoveries.

825
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,670
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and I'm glad that we haven't gone forward with any of these.

826
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:36,170
Speaker 1: I'm glad we haven't released any of them in any capacity because especially over the winter, the developments were sweet, but--.

827
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,530
Speaker 2: - So if you would have released too soon, you wouldn't have had these nice discoveries in the game.

828
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:39,770
Speaker 2: - Right.

829
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,790
Speaker 2: - It's good to take your time.

830
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,009
Speaker 1: - Yeah, yeah, so we're working hard on them.

831
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:49,649
Speaker 1: It's a slow process, but we're confident that when these come out, you guys are gonna like them.

832
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,066
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

833
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:50,670
Speaker 2: - All right.

834
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,950
Speaker 0: - This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

835
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:04,090
