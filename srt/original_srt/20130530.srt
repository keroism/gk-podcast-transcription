1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,976
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, May 30th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:12,039
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:13,362
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:14,685
Speaker 0: And this is Fart Nights.

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,510
Speaker 0: Tonight we're talking about farts.

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,251
Speaker 1: Terrific.

7
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:18,752
Speaker 0: Farting.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:19,814
Speaker 0: Your mom.

9
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:22,079
Speaker 0: Why Jake is in Finn's pocket.

10
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:23,883
Speaker 0: Hey bro.

11
00:00:25,868 --> 00:00:26,850
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:37,650
Speaker 0: So a little while ago we were talking about how small talk's kind of dumb and boring and we realized that we had actually just engaged in small talk about the weather.

13
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,597
Speaker 1: We talked about the weather a lot.

14
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:43,425
Speaker 0: Our conversation was, hey, warm today.

15
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:45,170
Speaker 1: That's sort of what we do.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,847
Speaker 0: I don't think you guys realize that in real life we say warm today pretty much every time we meet each other.

17
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:51,850
Speaker 1: If it was warm.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,872
Speaker 0: If it's warm.

19
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,842
Speaker 0: Or ironically, I think I say it equally often when it's woman out.

20
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,890
Speaker 0: If it's woman, I might say woman, I might say warm today.

21
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:06,368
Speaker 0: If I say warm today or woman, I pretty much just mean that the temperature is above or below 70 degrees.

22
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,830
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

23
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:10,153
Speaker 0: But yeah.

24
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:19,390
Speaker 0: Today, I don't know if it was the heat or what it was, but I was around my work downtown by City Hall and I saw a man.

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,792
Speaker 0: The man was fat.

26
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:26,827
Speaker 0: Like, in New York there aren't that many people who aren't tourists in tourist places who are like fat fat.

27
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,290
Speaker 0: Like notably fat.

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,135
Speaker 1: It's like freakin' fat Albert fat.

29
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, like this guy was fat Albert fat.

30
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,645
Speaker 0: He obviously had a custom suit on.

31
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:34,728
Speaker 0: I'm not ragging on fat people.

32
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:35,490
Speaker 0: That's not what I'm doing here.

33
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:42,901
Speaker 0: The guy was reeling behind him a briefcase on a stick.

34
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:45,285
Speaker 1: Not like a wheelie bag.

35
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:46,868
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a full bag.

36
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:48,150
Speaker 0: You know my messenger bag?

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,855
Speaker 1: It was like an attache case.

38
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,363
Speaker 0: It was a quarter the size of my messenger bag.

39
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,490
Speaker 0: In fact, I think attache case is what I would call it.

40
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:55,553
Speaker 0: There is no way.

41
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:58,261
Speaker 0: that thing weighed more than his hand.

42
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:01,170
Speaker 1: But maybe he couldn't get his hand in the handle because he was so fat.

43
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:14,470
Speaker 0: That is a possibility, but the fact that the fattest man I've seen in person in a long time was reeling behind him a briefcase so small that it was almost comical.

44
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:22,989
Speaker 0: He looked like the kind of thing you see in one of those comedy sketches where they put something ridiculous on the street and see how people react to it.

45
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,132
Speaker 0: Maybe it was.

46
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:26,456
Speaker 0: I actually stopped and was like, "Whoa, dude.

47
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:26,777
Speaker 0: Really?".

48
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:27,999
Speaker 1: Maybe that's what it was.

49
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,281
Speaker 0: In my brain I didn't say that to him.

50
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:30,163
Speaker 0: I wasn't like, "Whoa, dude.

51
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:31,466
Speaker 0: Can't pick that up?

52
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:32,888
Speaker 0: Can't just carry

53
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:33,109
Speaker 0: that?".

54
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,141
Speaker 0: It only weighs like maybe a quarter of a pound.

55
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,445
Speaker 0: I mean, I've eaten hamburgers.

56
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:40,030
Speaker 1: He might lose some weight if he carried it.

57
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,075
Speaker 0: I've eaten hamburgers that probably weigh more.

58
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,104
Speaker 0: The handle probably weighs more than your briefcase, dude.

59
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:47,250
Speaker 0: Also, you can't fit on the subway.

60
00:02:50,071 --> 00:03:00,909
Speaker 0: I didn't take a picture because while it was hilarious, I would have felt a little bit awkward standing behind a guy like that, obviously taking a picture of him.

61
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:05,929
Speaker 0: But if I had Google Glass, video would have already been up and it would have been my thing of the day.

62
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:14,490
Speaker 1: I'm on Amazon right now buying some water bottles and some bike water bottle cages because I lost another water bottle to the streets.

63
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,208
Speaker 0: So did you lose your water bottle cage too?

64
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,450
Speaker 1: No, but the cage clearly is not good.

65
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,510
Speaker 0: What water bottle cage do you have?

66
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,770
Speaker 1: The same metal-y one I've had forever.

67
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,669
Speaker 0: You've got to get a better one than that.

68
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,487
Speaker 1: I guess so.

69
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,550
Speaker 0: Did it come with your bike or did you buy it?

70
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,093
Speaker 1: I bought it.

71
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,449
Speaker 1: I bought the cheapest one a long time ago.

72
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,890
Speaker 0: I bought the cheapest one.

73
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:36,322
Speaker 1: I'm getting this new one that's the highest rated one on Amazon.

74
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:37,810
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm getting two of them.

75
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:38,585
Speaker 0: Why two?

76
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,050
Speaker 1: Because I can have two water bottles.

77
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,675
Speaker 0: Why do you need two?

78
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,150
Speaker 0: If you're doing that, just go Camelbak.

79
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:43,489
Speaker 1: I have a Camelbak also.

80
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,590
Speaker 0: You need two water bottles and a Camelbak?

81
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:46,867
Speaker 1: I can go real far.

82
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:48,907
Speaker 0: I guess you could.

83
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:50,290
Speaker 0: Anyway.

84
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:54,350
Speaker 1: And if it's not a Camelbak trip, like a trip to work, I can have extra water.

85
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:54,929
Speaker 0: Yeah.

86
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:55,539
Speaker 1: Anyway.

87
00:03:57,373 --> 00:04:00,090
Speaker 1: It was like a freaking bike down the road, right?

88
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,910
Speaker 1: And it's like bump and you're like, and it sort of sounded like I was like, Oh shit.

89
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,630
Speaker 1: And I stopped and I checked my tire out and it was just fine.

90
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:08,950
Speaker 1: And I'm like, Oh, what happened there?

91
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:15,010
Speaker 1: And it sort of sounded like maybe I ran over a soda bottle and dragged it or something like a flat one.

92
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,390
Speaker 0: Well, you did run over a bottle apparently.

93
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,870
Speaker 1: Well, apparently no, that was just the sound of my water bottle was scraping on the road and I actually went back for it.

94
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:30,270
Speaker 1: And of course, yeah, it was run over by a car and it could have been sort of salvaged except for the fact that like the mechanism and the nozzle was also smashed.

95
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,930
Speaker 0: And that mechanism is very important.

96
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,650
Speaker 0: It's why you buy the good water bottle instead of the cheap one.

97
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,050
Speaker 1: So meanwhile though, right?

98
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,190
Speaker 1: My cheapo do nothing water bottle, cheapo cage combination.

99
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:41,730
Speaker 1: I've never lost that one.

100
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,110
Speaker 1: But both times I've bought a fancy insulated water bottle.

101
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,826
Speaker 1: I've lost them.

102
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,550
Speaker 1: So we're going to fix the situation.

103
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a policy.

104
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,350
Speaker 0: I bought another of the fancy, fancy umbrella.

105
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:57,550
Speaker 0: So to not use it, not lose it like, Oh, let me add an umbrella to this order.

106
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:01,750
Speaker 0: I got it in a ridiculous pinkish purple color.

107
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,990
Speaker 0: So I'm hoping that I will never leave it behind anywhere again.

108
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,270
Speaker 0: If I leave this one anywhere, then fuck it.

109
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:09,050
Speaker 0: I don't deserve to own a nice umbrella.

110
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,162
Speaker 0: I'm going to buy the $5 umbrella.

111
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,890
Speaker 0: That'll last five rainstorms.

112
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,470
Speaker 1: Let me buy a, uh, let's see average customer review.

113
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:18,070
Speaker 1: The best umbrella.

114
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:18,451
Speaker 1: Okay.

115
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,830
Speaker 0: Anyway, so while you're buying that, I was an Amazon.

116
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,204
Speaker 0: I bought up going to step up the production values.

117
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:24,070
Speaker 0: a little bit of our video.

118
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:28,310
Speaker 0: I bought a much better led light panel than anything we own to date.

119
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,240
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

120
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:29,870
Speaker 0: Thanks.

121
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,096
Speaker 0: Yeah.

122
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,710
Speaker 0: Apparently makes the shit tier of led panels.

123
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,029
Speaker 0: So I'm buying one of those instead of the sub shit tier.

124
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,510
Speaker 1: Like the place that has the pastries.

125
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,129
Speaker 0: No fancy like fancier.

126
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:41,989
Speaker 1: Okay.

127
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,970
Speaker 0: They just, they, it seems like they just take commodity led panels, slap some basic electronics on them and sell them at a markup.

128
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:52,550
Speaker 0: But the markup is less than the annoyance of building one myself from scratch.

129
00:05:52,670 --> 00:06:00,830
Speaker 1: So in between the time I added the water bottle to my car and trying to add the umbrella to my cart, Amazon updated their add to cart button area with better graphics.

130
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,449
Speaker 0: Oh, all right.

131
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,010
Speaker 1: Interesting.

132
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I kind of cheated.

133
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:07,190
Speaker 0: I saw, I saw this led panel at anime Boston.

134
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,210
Speaker 0: Someone was using it to light up their display in the dealer's room.

135
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:11,630
Speaker 0: So I walk over to their table.

136
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,310
Speaker 0: I get all excited.

137
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,810
Speaker 0: Like, Ooh, this guy might buy something.

138
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,529
Speaker 0: And I go over and I'm like, yeah, this is the light I want to buy.

139
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,630
Speaker 0: And I just like ask him questions about the light and I check it out.

140
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,110
Speaker 0: Then I buy it on Amazon.

141
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:25,789
Speaker 0: I think they were selling like little sculptures of fairies that I didn't really care about.

142
00:06:27,672 --> 00:06:29,450
Speaker 0: That's got to feel bad when you've like got a thing.

143
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,390
Speaker 0: Like I'm exhibiting X and someone comes over.

144
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,810
Speaker 0: It's like, man, what do you print those posters on?

145
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,288
Speaker 0: Like what company did you use?

146
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:49,650
Speaker 0: So I'm poking around on the internet and I notice because I'm doing some YouTube stuff, basically continuously filing all of the filings I need to file to get Yamato SRL to lose their claims to every goddamn episode of geek nights presents.

147
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:55,250
Speaker 0: I win every time, but they dispute me every time and I have to do the double dispute.

148
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:56,890
Speaker 1: I think they're just doing it automatically.

149
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,790
Speaker 0: No, they, yeah, they, they ping me automatically.

150
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:04,169
Speaker 0: I dispute with a copy paste because it's the same dispute every time.

151
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,269
Speaker 0: So a human being on their side rejects my dispute and maintains the claim.

152
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:13,990
Speaker 0: So then I have to go and say, look, fucking sue me or GTFO.

153
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:16,949
Speaker 0: And they have yet to actually sue me.

154
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,409
Speaker 0: So YouTube's like, yeah, whatevs, but I got to keep doing it.

155
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:22,370
Speaker 0: And I noticed that one of our videos got linked somewhere.

156
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,909
Speaker 0: I love how I can see these analytics.

157
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:31,870
Speaker 0: But Neo gaff linked again, or maybe the old thread about it came up again to our old ballot of dude, bro.

158
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,497
Speaker 0: And that's how I discovered that our ballot of dude, bro.

159
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:38,950
Speaker 0: video seems to be the primary citation for the know your mean page.

160
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,290
Speaker 1: As opposed to the original dude, both thread itself on dude, bro.

161
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:50,850
Speaker 0: It's basically in order our video, which I guess aggregates the, the story of that thread, the thread itself and Wikipedia.

162
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,950
Speaker 0: Those are the three sources.

163
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,430
Speaker 0: So we are like the source on dude, bro.

164
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,969
Speaker 1: You want to see one of the most highly shit is fucked up.

165
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,428
Speaker 0: So I got to shoot slash slice you too.

166
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:03,650
Speaker 0: It's straight up dog time.

167
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,329
Speaker 1: This is one of the most highly rated umbrellas on Amazon.

168
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,470
Speaker 0: That's I can see why that's a highly rated umbrella.

169
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,268
Speaker 0: Do you want it?

170
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:13,290
Speaker 0: I kind of do, but I already have an umbrella.

171
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:20,210
Speaker 0: My umbrella is Twilight Sparkle colored as opposed to as opposed to actual literal Twilight Sparkle umbrella.

172
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,110
Speaker 0: I really want, you know what I want?

173
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,330
Speaker 0: I want like a rainbow dash cutie mark umbrella.

174
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,249
Speaker 0: That's in the shape of my fancy sense of umbrella.

175
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,510
Speaker 0: Cause fuck those uniform umbrellas.

176
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:39,289
Speaker 0: I want umbrellas that are oblique, that are asymmetrical because otherwise you're just an asshole with a golf umbrella or you got an umbrella is too small.

177
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:42,308
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's what I got.

178
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:54,310
Speaker 0: Neo Gaff rediscovered that we did the research, the minimal research to talk about dude, bro, a meme that seems to disappear and then is perennially remembered by the internet.

179
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:56,709
Speaker 1: That's your news?

180
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:57,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Thursday.

181
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,338
Speaker 1: I thought we were going to talk about.

182
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,390
Speaker 1: pecs is a hour change.

183
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,590
Speaker 0: I was going to talk about that too, but I wondered if you had anything.

184
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,709
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

185
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,569
Speaker 1: It's your mom.

186
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, there isn't really too much news.

187
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:16,430
Speaker 1: The only news really going around is pecs of course is four days, but now we know the hours and windows 8.1 I guess, which is we can save that for Monday.

188
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:17,910
Speaker 0: We should save that for Monday.

189
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:18,390
Speaker 1: Okay.

190
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:20,108
Speaker 0: So cause I got a lot to say about it.

191
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,410
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the pecs hours.

192
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:25,464
Speaker 1: So as people may or may not know pecs prime 2013 is going to be four days.

193
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,510
Speaker 1: So it's actually going to be during labor day, which means you have to go home Tuesday morning, not Monday morning.

194
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:44,430
Speaker 0: Now I point out that in the past we would talk about how the difference between mag vest and pecs was that having that extra day being a full four days really changes the feel of a convention.

195
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,572
Speaker 0: Because you, cause.

196
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:51,450
Speaker 1: normally you have the Friday night where you stay out late, but you have an entry day and an exit day and then the real day in the middle.

197
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,870
Speaker 1: If you have two real full days in the middle there, which means you have three stay up late nights.

198
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:03,665
Speaker 0: That is the key, but they backed off on the hours.

199
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:04,950
Speaker 0: pecs closes at midnight now.

200
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:06,548
Speaker 1: What are we going to do?

201
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:12,189
Speaker 0: Our pecs modus operandi is walk out of pecs when they kick us the fuck out at 2 AM.

202
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,130
Speaker 1: Well pecs is still 14 hours longer than it used to be.

203
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,950
Speaker 1: So we'll either get more sleep or we'll have to find some way to game ourselves without pecs until 2 AM.

204
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,570
Speaker 0: Now what this might do, which won't be bad for prime.

205
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,815
Speaker 0: I don't do this at east because there's nowhere to do it.

206
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:34,050
Speaker 0: that makes sense, but at prime I will go to people's parties and I'll go hang out like in a hotel bar somewhere with someone at night.

207
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,084
Speaker 0: I feel like maybe more of that's going to happen, which you know what it might have.

208
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:40,769
Speaker 0: the side effect that I'm thinking about just now.

209
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,850
Speaker 0: You know how when we're in pecs in the tabletop area like hanging out, half of us are playing games and half of us are just kind of sitting there dicking around.

210
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:55,150
Speaker 0: I think everyone will play games because they know that at midnight when we get kicked out, we're all going to go somewhere and just stick around.

211
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,589
Speaker 0: So it'll raise the quality of the gaming by reducing the hours.

212
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,450
Speaker 1: I think it will, because it's four days, I think it will enable bigger games, right, than otherwise, right?

213
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,010
Speaker 1: So it's like, yeah, okay, we can't game until 2 AM, but we have this whole extra day here on Sunday.

214
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:12,605
Speaker 0: Let's play eclipse.

215
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's play like eclipse, like, you know, be like magfest, like, hey, let's play eclipse.

216
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:19,190
Speaker 1: Let's play, you know, fucking big ass games.

217
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,709
Speaker 1: Let's play some tabletop RPG that takes five hours.

218
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,159
Speaker 0: So before, all right, it's 11 o'clock.

219
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,670
Speaker 0: We can't start playing eclipse because we'll get kicked out at two.

220
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:36,709
Speaker 0: But if we're kicked out at midnight, I don't feel bad about starting a game of eclipse at midnight somewhere else.

221
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:37,550
Speaker 1: Exactly.

222
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,108
Speaker 0: But I can't start a game of eclipse at two.

223
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,029
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to dedicate this Pax Prime to more tabletop RPGing.

224
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,899
Speaker 0: I think what I'm going to do is pick two of the days.

225
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,070
Speaker 0: I'm going to dedicate one day to nothing but tabletop RPGs.

226
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,310
Speaker 0: I'm going to dedicate one day to nothing but hardcore board games.

227
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,215
Speaker 1: I figure, you know, I got Paxes.

228
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,869
Speaker 1: I'll, you know, I'll switch it up Pax by Pax as opposed to...

229
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,750
Speaker 0: I do want to run one off torch bearers at Pax Prime.

230
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,369
Speaker 1: We got to have some torch bearers by then.

231
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,330
Speaker 0: I'm confident I can trick them into giving us ours early if they can't get it to us by Pax.

232
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,510
Speaker 1: They'll probably be there.

233
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,495
Speaker 0: I know they will.

234
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:14,430
Speaker 0: I'm trying to get them to be on our Pax dev panel.

235
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,720
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's see.

236
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:17,586
Speaker 1: What else?

237
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:18,270
Speaker 1: I guess that's it.

238
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:22,630
Speaker 1: It'll be interesting to see the different Pax hours and how that affects the show and whatnot.

239
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,981
Speaker 1: I think it's mostly just for enforcers, right?

240
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:30,310
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, enforcers have to work the pony shift that many times.

241
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,289
Speaker 1: It's like, it's not going to work.

242
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

243
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:36,070
Speaker 0: I, someday I want to enforce Prime, but this will not be that time.

244
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:36,608
Speaker 1: No, it will not.

245
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:44,370
Speaker 0: Because I'm already, if we go to Pax dev and the four day Pax, we're going to fly out on fucking Tuesday and fly back on Tuesday.

246
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:49,190
Speaker 0: And that's if we have no days in Seattle, just ah.

247
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a whole lot of hotel and food monies.

248
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,072
Speaker 0: Exactly.

249
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:55,990
Speaker 0: And the thing is, it's dev and Pax, so we're going to be in the expensive hotel the whole time.

250
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,590
Speaker 0: We can't like shift to the cheaper hotel at any point.

251
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:00,629
Speaker 1: Like we're going to do in Australia.

252
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,030
Speaker 0: Like we're going to do in Australia.

253
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,149
Speaker 0: We're only going to be in the Pax hotel for Pax.

254
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,210
Speaker 1: And the Pax hotel in Australia is like a hundred something a night.

255
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:08,801
Speaker 0: I know, whatevs.

256
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:10,484
Speaker 0: Whatevs.

257
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,753
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

258
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,800
Speaker 0: You got a thing of the day?

259
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,300
Speaker 1: I feel like I used this as a thing of the day before, but that happens a lot and often I'm wrong.

260
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,111
Speaker 1: So what the hell?

261
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:25,739
Speaker 1: I don't care.

262
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,800
Speaker 1: This is a video from 2011.

263
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,540
Speaker 1: Apparently there's a race, a bike race in Pittsburgh called the Dirty Dozen Race, which includes, it's a bike race.

264
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:38,100
Speaker 1: And it includes the 13 steepest hills in Pittsburgh.

265
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,367
Speaker 1: So it's the Dirty Dozen, right?

266
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,420
Speaker 1: So it's a baker's dozen, I guess, of hills.

267
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:48,620
Speaker 1: And it includes one hill, Canton Avenue, which is quote the steepest road on earth.

268
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:49,939
Speaker 1: It's really freaking steep.

269
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,840
Speaker 1: It's like almost 40 degrees incline, something ridiculous.

270
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:58,040
Speaker 1: And in this video, you see people trying to bike up that hill.

271
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,719
Speaker 1: Some people managed to make it.

272
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,492
Speaker 1: They just get their low gear and they stand up and they go and they get up the hill because it's really not that long a hill.

273
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,239
Speaker 1: It's just really steep.

274
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:10,879
Speaker 1: But other people fall down hilariously.

275
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Speaker 1: And it is like, oh my God, look at that guy fall into the other guy.

276
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,120
Speaker 1: There's a big collapse.

277
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,540
Speaker 0: I can see falling down if you're going up and then the guy in front of you derps.

278
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,139
Speaker 1: That happens once in this video.

279
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:27,100
Speaker 0: I actually watched a pretty crazy derp accident that I think someone broke a bone on the Williamsburg bridge the other day.

280
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,860
Speaker 1: Was the bone sticking out of her body?

281
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,259
Speaker 0: Basically, I'm biking and there's a wobbly girl in front of me.

282
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,338
Speaker 1: She's got to turn that gear down.

283
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,418
Speaker 1: Did she even have gear?

284
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,047
Speaker 0: No, her gear was down.

285
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,040
Speaker 0: She's just wobbly girl.

286
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,560
Speaker 0: Wobbly girl is a thing that I see every day somewhere on my bike commute.

287
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,320
Speaker 0: They're just kind of meandering around the road like, wobble, wobble, wobble, wobble, going super slow.

288
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,240
Speaker 0: And she was just wobbling and this guy goes around her and gives her a wide berth to pass.

289
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:58,500
Speaker 0: And she just wobbles like strafe, like three feet to the left, right into him and shoulder checks him.

290
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:02,859
Speaker 0: And they both go flying and flipping and rolling in a mess.

291
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,645
Speaker 1: How fast are they going?

292
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:06,234
Speaker 1: Wobbly person's probably not going too fast.

293
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:07,160
Speaker 1: How fast is this dude going?

294
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,267
Speaker 0: Well, the dude was coming.

295
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,160
Speaker 0: Well, so it's a little more complicated.

296
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,840
Speaker 1: Was he going downhill?

297
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,600
Speaker 0: The guy was going super fast.

298
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:13,077
Speaker 1: Okay.

299
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:14,638
Speaker 0: And coming up behind her.

300
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,940
Speaker 1: Downhill or uphill?

301
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,060
Speaker 0: We were kind of like just over the crest of the hill.

302
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:19,840
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

303
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,440
Speaker 0: And the girl was going to wobbly, wobbly, wobbly, not fast.

304
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:25,580
Speaker 0: But the other guy was so fast that he was like, buh buh buh buh.

305
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,678
Speaker 0: But she was the one who got hurt.

306
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,620
Speaker 1: Okay, good.

307
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,919
Speaker 0: I guess good.

308
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,980
Speaker 1: Whoever's wobbly deserves it.

309
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,520
Speaker 1: When you're riding a bike, you should be going straight without veering, just like in a car.

310
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,140
Speaker 1: If a car is going like, you think the person driving it is drunk, maybe she was drunk.

311
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,200
Speaker 1: But yeah, do not wobble on the bike.

312
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,860
Speaker 1: You should keep everything straight in the line.

313
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,759
Speaker 0: If you're wobbling, you're probably in too high a gear.

314
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,087
Speaker 1: Probably, yeah.

315
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,178
Speaker 1: Or you don't have gears.

316
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,579
Speaker 0: Even the city bikes have gears.

317
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,522
Speaker 1: Yeah.

318
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,576
Speaker 1: Someone told me it's an automatic transmission.

319
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:55,240
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

320
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,440
Speaker 0: I have not used one yet, so I can't say.

321
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,620
Speaker 1: There is some sort of weird mechanism, though, attached to the rear axle.

322
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,520
Speaker 0: Well, that is to power the LED blinky lights that are always on when you're biking.

323
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,660
Speaker 0: Oh.

324
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,420
Speaker 0: And there might be other functions.

325
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:09,015
Speaker 1: There might also be an odometer.

326
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:09,399
Speaker 1: I don't know.

327
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,040
Speaker 0: I have not investigated city bikes closely yet.

328
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,420
Speaker 1: But yeah, they're heavy as fuck, apparently.

329
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:23,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're like, in Japan, the term is Mama Charlie for that just shit-tier bike that is perfectly fine to kind of get around the city, but is not pleasant to ride.

330
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,930
Speaker 0: So, yeah, my thing of the day is pretty straightforward.

331
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:34,350
Speaker 0: There's a movie that I realize a lot of you probably haven't seen called Maximum Overdrive.

332
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,030
Speaker 1: Now, Maximum Overdrive is a title that sounds like something that is famous, that you know.

333
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,384
Speaker 1: But I really -- you tell me the name, Maximum Overdrive, and I'm like, "That sounds like the name of something pretty

334
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:44,928
Speaker 1: significant.".

335
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,590
Speaker 1: I cannot tell you what the fuck it is.

336
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,811
Speaker 0: It is.

337
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:52,750
Speaker 0: So, Maximum Overdrive is an '80s movie based on a Stephen King novel directed by Stephen King.

338
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:54,630
Speaker 1: He knows about film?

339
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:57,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a bunch of Stephen King stuff.

340
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, but usually other people make the movies, right?

341
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, he directed it, he wrote the screenplay, he based it on one of his books.

342
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,769
Speaker 0: I never actually read the book.

343
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:13,329
Speaker 0: The plot of Maximum Overdrive is that one day, technology tries to kill all humans.

344
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:20,229
Speaker 0: But it was made in the '80s, so it's not -- like, in the modern day, it'd be like, "My smartphone empties my bank account and tries to shock

345
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:20,369
Speaker 0: me.".

346
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,290
Speaker 1: So, it's not the Terminator?

347
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:27,849
Speaker 0: No, so it's basically low-level mechanical stuff, so trucks and steam rollers.

348
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,330
Speaker 1: But then how could even, like, a truck frickin' come to life?

349
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,049
Speaker 1: It makes no sense.

350
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,708
Speaker 0: I guess spirits take 'em over or something, I don't know.

351
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,450
Speaker 0: But this movie -- It's not gonna work, dude.

352
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:45,830
Speaker 0: We recently did a panel in Anime Boston, a lecture, where we talked about how people recommend stuff and they're usually bad at it, and one of the points we made is that there is an art to recommending the bad movie.

353
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:52,549
Speaker 0: 'Cause if a movie's bad, but it sucks to watch, it is not fun to say, "Hey, let's all get drunk and watch the bad

354
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:52,810
Speaker 0: movie.".

355
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:54,109
Speaker 0: No, no one has a good time.

356
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,830
Speaker 0: Maximum Overdrive is one of the movies that's bad in the way that you can enjoy how bad it is while watching it.

357
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,409
Speaker 0: It also stars Emilio Estevez.

358
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:04,658
Speaker 1: Okay.

359
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:05,730
Speaker 1: Your favorite guy?

360
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,429
Speaker 0: Do you know who Emilio Estevez is?

361
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,090
Speaker 1: The coach in The Mighty Ducks?

362
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:09,755
Speaker 0: That is correct.

363
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,529
Speaker 0: Can you name any other thing he's ever done?

364
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:15,533
Speaker 1: The coach in Mighty Ducks 2?

365
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,022
Speaker 0: I don't know if he actually did that or not.

366
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:17,887
Speaker 0: Yes, he did.

367
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:18,310
Speaker 0: Yes, he did.

368
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:18,910
Speaker 0: Alright.

369
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,015
Speaker 0: Gordon Bombay.

370
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:20,741
Speaker 0: He played it in 2.

371
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:21,810
Speaker 0: I pulled up his filmography.

372
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:23,788
Speaker 1: The cheap answer.

373
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:32,910
Speaker 0: So, this movie has a moment where a steamroller comes out of nowhere and kills some kid.

374
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:35,428
Speaker 0: And the whole movie is like this.

375
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,799
Speaker 0: So, this is my thing of the day.

376
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,710
Speaker 0: It's really this entire movie.

377
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,290
Speaker 0: The scene is just typical of it.

378
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,190
Speaker 0: There's a scene where they're all like holed up in this truck stop or something.

379
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,329
Speaker 0: And the trucks start honking their horns.

380
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,690
Speaker 0: And someone in the cast knows Morse code.

381
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,140
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Oh my god!

382
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:52,905
Speaker 0: It's Morse

383
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:53,268
Speaker 0: code!".

384
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,341
Speaker 0: They're saying, "Someone has to pump the gas.

385
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:57,405
Speaker 0: Do not kill all of

386
00:18:57,465 --> 00:18:57,686
Speaker 0: them.".

387
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:03,670
Speaker 0: And the movie is just great in that really shit-tier way.

388
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,130
Speaker 0: Shit-tier has been my term lately.

389
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:06,529
Speaker 0: For stuff.

390
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,930
Speaker 0: Meta Moment book club book is Player of Games, Ian M. Banks.

391
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,857
Speaker 0: I'm going to read it really soon.

392
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:11,584
Speaker 0: We'll do a show on it.

393
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:12,169
Speaker 0: Scott already read it.

394
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,809
Speaker 1: Are you really?

395
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:14,990
Speaker 1: I finished like weeks ago already.

396
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,292
Speaker 0: I know.

397
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:16,147
Speaker 0: I've been busy with shit.

398
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:16,714
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

399
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:17,606
Speaker 1: Me too, but I read it.

400
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I've been more busy with more shit.

401
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:20,262
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

402
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,812
Speaker 0: Yeah.

403
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,509
Speaker 0: I've been editing video.

404
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,197
Speaker 1: Me too.

405
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,150
Speaker 0: I've been editing video of a higher caliber than you've been editing.

406
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:27,084
Speaker 0: What video?

407
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:27,429
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

408
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,397
Speaker 0: Anime Boston.

409
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,169
Speaker 0: You did edit video.

410
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,990
Speaker 1: Biking videos, Netrunner videos, and a panel for Anime Boston.

411
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,789
Speaker 0: Are your biking videos anything other than you biking to work?

412
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:35,988
Speaker 0: No.

413
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:36,547
Speaker 0: Okay.

414
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,369
Speaker 1: I mean, what else am I supposed to do?

415
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,078
Speaker 0: We were at Anime Boston.

416
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,290
Speaker 0: We will post video as I have time.

417
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,270
Speaker 0: Our next convention is Connecticon, where we run the panels and workshops department.

418
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:48,210
Speaker 0: We're doing a bunch of our own stuff.

419
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,488
Speaker 1: And the week after that is?

420
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:50,686
Speaker 0: PAX Australia.

421
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:51,248
Speaker 0: Fuck me.

422
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:51,773
Speaker 0: Where we're doing?

423
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:54,089
Speaker 0: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

424
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,009
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

425
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 0: But a new updated version of it.

426
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:58,050
Speaker 0: We're adding Torchbearer.

427
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,230
Speaker 0: And I'm going to let you all in on a secret.

428
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,709
Speaker 0: We're adding Dungeons and Dragons to it.

429
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:03,489
Speaker 1: Oh no.

430
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,930
Speaker 0: Because most people who think of D&D only know like fourth ed.

431
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,529
Speaker 0: Maybe three point fifth ed.

432
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:10,004
Speaker 1: Fifth ed.

433
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,008
Speaker 0: Because that's not out yet.

434
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is sort of.

435
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,689
Speaker 1: They were playing it.

436
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,250
Speaker 1: What do you think I was managing lines for as an enforcer at fricking PAX East?

437
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,309
Speaker 1: People were waiting in fuck line to play like these fifth ed demos.

438
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,510
Speaker 1: Or I guess D&D next or whatever it's called.

439
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a work in progress still as far as I can tell.

440
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, people were playing it.

441
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,210
Speaker 1: They were lining the fuck up and the line filled like instantly.

442
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:35,950
Speaker 0: All I have to say about it is that it has mutually exclusive goals according to the things they've said about it.

443
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,330
Speaker 0: So I have zero faith in fifth edition.

444
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if I said, all right guys, we're going to set this new software project.

445
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,350
Speaker 1: Our goals is to make it cheap, fast and awesome.

446
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:49,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we want a data processing engine that has very low latency and very high throughput.

447
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:54,410
Speaker 0: You really only get to pick one of those unless you have money for hardware.

448
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:57,929
Speaker 1: I want to have a lot of money and I want the money to be really valuable money.

449
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,970
Speaker 1: I don't want it to be invaluable inflated money.

450
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:03,007
Speaker 1: I want a lot of it.

451
00:21:03,794 --> 00:21:04,789
Speaker 0: I want to drink a whole bunch of beer.

452
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,688
Speaker 1: I want so much of it.

453
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,149
Speaker 0: I like drinking beer, but I don't want to have to pee.

454
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,489
Speaker 1: I want to print this money.

455
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,250
Speaker 1: That's how much I want.

456
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,890
Speaker 1: I want so much that I print it, but I don't want the value to decrease as I print it.

457
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:21,910
Speaker 0: I want to mine silver from the Americas in vast quantities and use it as my currency, yet not devalue my own currency.

458
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,687
Speaker 0: In Spain, I'm looking at you.

459
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:29,650
Speaker 0: So we're talking about farts, but first the meta moment.

460
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,089
Speaker 1: We already did the meta moment.

461
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,430
Speaker 0: Is there anything else to say in the meta moment?

462
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,150
Speaker 0: Join our forum, like our videos.

463
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, do all our internet stuff.

464
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,750
Speaker 1: Come see us on the internets and all the places.

465
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,810
Speaker 1: If there is a place on the internet that you frequent, we are there.

466
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:51,690
Speaker 0: If you like our videos, actually like them and post them in your forums, because the more people watch our videos, the faster we will produce Geek Nights Presents.

467
00:21:53,971 --> 00:22:00,130
Speaker 0: And beyond all that, if you want Geek Nights t-shirts to come back, indicate that to me in some way.

468
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:06,610
Speaker 0: I'm trying to figure out if it's worth my effort to set up a new store now that Google has completely discontinued checkout.

469
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can set up a new store.

470
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:12,970
Speaker 1: We can reprint the old t-shirt if people still want it and then maybe make a new one.

471
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,029
Speaker 0: I got some good ideas for new shirt designs too.

472
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:16,770
Speaker 1: She's getting artists to do that.

473
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,130
Speaker 0: And I might see if Dave and Joel want to go in with us on something as well.

474
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,017
Speaker 1: A crossover shirt?

475
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,370
Speaker 1: I mean, their shirt sells way better than ours.

476
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,490
Speaker 1: Every Geek Nights listener I ever meet at a convention is wearing the Dave and Joel shirt.

477
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,209
Speaker 0: So I have a message for one Dave Riley and Joel White who never go to conventions.

478
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,245
Speaker 0: Ahem.

479
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:45,370
Speaker 0: Your fans, who often are also fans of us, but not always, seek us out at conventions to tell us how awesome you are because you are never there.

480
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:51,210
Speaker 0: If you come to the conventions, your fans will love you and say hi to you in person.

481
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:58,070
Speaker 0: If you want us to continue being your proxies for fan love, we might start making things up about you.

482
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,707
Speaker 1: Every time someone comes up to me at a convention, right?

483
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:02,310
Speaker 1: To talk to me.

484
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:03,170
Speaker 1: Even if they're a fan of us.

485
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,899
Speaker 1: I have never once seen anyone wearing a Geek Nights shirt.

486
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:09,090
Speaker 1: They are always wearing the Dave and Joel shirt.

487
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,552
Speaker 0: I have.

488
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:09,735
Speaker 0: Pax East.

489
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,689
Speaker 0: There's a guy wearing a Geek Nights shirt.

490
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:11,190
Speaker 1: Okay.

491
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:17,930
Speaker 0: Which is, the reason it's rare is because we only sold a small number of them before I stopped bothering to run the store.

492
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:19,700
Speaker 0: I still have a box of them.

493
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,325
Speaker 0: we could just sell.

494
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:20,909
Speaker 0: I just don't.

495
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:27,430
Speaker 0: But yeah, pretty much the Geek Nights official shirt is the Fast Karate Hanabi shirt at this point.

496
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,479
Speaker 0: So yeah, Dave and Joel, come to a con.

497
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,504
Speaker 0: Oh wait, they are.

498
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:32,690
Speaker 0: Dave's going to be a Kineticon.

499
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:33,364
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

500
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:35,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's on.

501
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:37,309
Speaker 0: It's a fart.

502
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:40,289
Speaker 1: I make them a lot.

503
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:41,573
Speaker 0: I will say this.

504
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:45,910
Speaker 0: The role of a fart in human evolution in this day and age is very simple.

505
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:47,950
Speaker 1: It is- To keep your guts from exploding?

506
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:56,010
Speaker 0: Without exception, the best possible way to punctuate any point you ever make in an argument.

507
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,888
Speaker 0: If you say something like, "And that is why the Assyrians

508
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:00,290
Speaker 0: fell!"

509
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,090
Speaker 0: And then you pause and then you immediately fart.

510
00:24:03,691 --> 00:24:06,330
Speaker 0: There is literally no better way to win an argument.

511
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,909
Speaker 1: Drop can fart?

512
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:10,935
Speaker 0: I don't know.

513
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,350
Speaker 0: I fart kind of loudly and often.

514
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:15,175
Speaker 0: And I actually do.

515
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:19,450
Speaker 0: Emily will be mad now that she knows that this is true and that it's not just a joke.

516
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:21,449
Speaker 0: And that she's always suspected that I do this.

517
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:26,490
Speaker 0: If I have a fart built up, I actually will try to hold it in until there's a funny moment where I can fart.

518
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,109
Speaker 0: Especially during a silence.

519
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:33,489
Speaker 0: Like if I'm up on stage, if I'm like, "Can anyone name an anime that's worse than Desert

520
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:33,770
Speaker 0: Punk?"

521
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:35,941
Speaker 0: And then I just fart like right after that.

522
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:37,450
Speaker 0: That is comedy gold right there.

523
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, I usually just let the farts out as soon as the pressure's building.

524
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,448
Speaker 1: It's like, "Why should I hurt myself by inflating my stomach with painful

525
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:44,750
Speaker 1: gases?".

526
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,776
Speaker 0: See, that I agree with 100%.

527
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:52,930
Speaker 0: I dislike people who say... Anyone who thinks you should go to the bathroom if you have to fart or walk away and fart.

528
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaker 0: It's like, no, you only walk away and fart if you're walking out of an elevator.

529
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,690
Speaker 0: In which case you want to fart before you walk away.

530
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't fart in an elevator.

531
00:24:59,617 --> 00:25:01,230
Speaker 1: That's crossing a line there.

532
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,152
Speaker 0: What do you do though?

533
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,367
Speaker 0: So wait, so Scott, if you have to fart and you're in an elevator, you actually wait?

534
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:05,889
Speaker 0: You hold it in?

535
00:25:06,752 --> 00:25:08,670
Speaker 1: As soon as the doors open, I step out and fart.

536
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:10,523
Speaker 0: You don't fart, then step out?

537
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:11,107
Speaker 0: No.

538
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:11,550
Speaker 0: Why not?

539
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,216
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's a line, right?

540
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:14,122
Speaker 0: So what's the line?

541
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:15,390
Speaker 0: Is the line human decency?

542
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:17,476
Speaker 1: It's somewhat related to that.

543
00:25:17,757 --> 00:25:20,990
Speaker 1: I mean, if you fart, right, it's gonna do some damage, right?

544
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,550
Speaker 1: In terms of people are gonna smell that shit and get your poop in their nose.

545
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,130
Speaker 0: So I do have a theory I'm gonna get back to, so remind me about the damage.

546
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,362
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's actually, most of my farts are non-smelly.

547
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:32,370
Speaker 1: They just make noise and I don't really smell them.

548
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,609
Speaker 1: And other people don't really smell them either most of the time.

549
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,010
Speaker 0: What I notice about you is your farts contain a sort of hidden power.

550
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,338
Speaker 0: They're very sudden and forceful.

551
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:45,830
Speaker 0: Like if I fart, sometimes it's like that *fart noise* you know, the kind of long fart.

552
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,495
Speaker 0: You'll just be like BAM!

553
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:51,370
Speaker 0: It's like a soap wafer that just has one beat played.

554
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,588
Speaker 1: Got some powerful ass.

555
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,630
Speaker 0: Mine are often more the like *fart noise*.

556
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:00,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's called diarrhea.

557
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:00,690
Speaker 1: Go to the bathroom.

558
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,854
Speaker 1: Nah.

559
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:06,750
Speaker 0: What I can't pull off, maybe only fat people can do this, but there's that particular comedic fart.

560
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,369
Speaker 0: Where you have the normal fart and then the pause and then there's that kind of like high pitched squeal at the end.

561
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,830
Speaker 0: That like, I can't really do it.

562
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like that Austin Powers fat bastard nonsense.

563
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:18,036
Speaker 0: I know.

564
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:19,690
Speaker 0: I wish I could make that fart happen.

565
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,630
Speaker 1: I could do it with my mouth and my hands or my armpit or whatever.

566
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:28,950
Speaker 0: The only good fart I can do, the secret, kids who try to make the fart noise always try to go like *fart noise* or something.

567
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,870
Speaker 0: Nah, you gotta get the lip up there.

568
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:37,110
Speaker 1: We used to always do the one where you put the heels of your palms like sort of against each other.

569
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:39,130
Speaker 0: Up against your face?

570
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,329
Speaker 1: Up against your face and then you *fart noise*.

571
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:42,410
Speaker 1: Nah, that's not how it is.

572
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,490
Speaker 0: I can't really do it anymore.

573
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,500
Speaker 1: *fart noise*.

574
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:45,890
Speaker 1: I can't do it anymore either.

575
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:47,210
Speaker 0: As a little kid I was obsessed.

576
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,190
Speaker 1: It's all about making your cheeks flap against your hands.

577
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,250
Speaker 0: With that vaudeville style armpit one, but it actually doesn't make that good of a fart noise.

578
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:55,769
Speaker 0: And then your hand smells like armpit.

579
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, it can be used to great effect though in certain situations.

580
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:01,128
Speaker 1: Usually musical uses.

581
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:10,850
Speaker 0: Well you only do the armpit fart if you need fine control over the fart or you're doing a visual gag where you need it to be clear that you're making a fake fart noise.

582
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,369
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, if you're playing music, right?

583
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:16,450
Speaker 1: The armpit fart is good because you don't need to get the breaths in there, right?

584
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:23,140
Speaker 1: So you can just get something going on like a funky beat going with the armpit, right?

585
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:25,379
Speaker 1: Without any breaks in it or something like that.

586
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,649
Speaker 1: Yeah.

587
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:35,720
Speaker 1: So for a musical instrument purposes, the armpit or the two hand squeeze that you usually use to squeeze water at people, but can also make fart noises if it's dry.

588
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,369
Speaker 1: You know, some people use that method.

589
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,637
Speaker 1: That's good for like *fart noise*.

590
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,785
Speaker 0: So I have a theory in terms of farts.

591
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:46,640
Speaker 0: I believe that the damage of a fart is inversely proportional to the loudness of the fart.

592
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:51,420
Speaker 0: I've never really experienced the loud fart that was also damaging.

593
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:55,057
Speaker 1: No, I think it simply has to do with how clean someone's ass is, right?

594
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,599
Speaker 0: No, that's not where the smell comes from.

595
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:07,300
Speaker 0: Unless you were putting toilet paper inside your ass and wiping around in there or like animating deep inside, that has no bearing on the smell of a fart.

596
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:11,499
Speaker 0: That has bearing on the smell of you smell like someone who doesn't wipe his ass.

597
00:28:12,644 --> 00:28:13,619
Speaker 0: That smell doesn't go away.

598
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,599
Speaker 1: It also has to do with what you eat, right?

599
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:22,940
Speaker 1: If the poop that's inside your guts is more liquidy right now and the gas comes from, you know, past that and pushes, right?

600
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,892
Speaker 1: Versus maybe you got some really hard poops coming through, right?

601
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:27,876
Speaker 1: They're really dry.

602
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:28,860
Speaker 1: You didn't drink enough water.

603
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,125
Speaker 0: But then the gas serves an important purpose.

604
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:34,100
Speaker 0: If you got the hard poop like up against the end, you could have the single shot clean delivery.

605
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,539
Speaker 0: But we're not talking about poop, so.

606
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,463
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

607
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:39,260
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that that's the relation between poop and farts, right?

608
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,403
Speaker 0: But why the sound?

609
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:44,520
Speaker 0: How come whenever I fart and it's silent, it's the worst?

610
00:28:45,164 --> 00:28:47,320
Speaker 0: But if I fart and it's loud, it doesn't smell like anything.

611
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,659
Speaker 0: That seems to be a common trend.

612
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,366
Speaker 0: Silent but deadly.

613
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:54,940
Speaker 0: In middle school, we knew this to be truth, but why?

614
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,570
Speaker 1: I don't know.

615
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,419
Speaker 1: I can test that it's true to begin with.

616
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,198
Speaker 0: Why are silent farts so smelly, so deadly, more deadly?

617
00:29:04,258 --> 00:29:04,680
Speaker 0: Okay, Google.

618
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,580
Speaker 1: See, I can test that this is actually true.

619
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,347
Speaker 1: But let's assume that it's true.

620
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:12,340
Speaker 1: Let us surmise why it could be, right?

621
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,800
Speaker 1: I think it might have to be a relation between the position.

622
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,900
Speaker 0: Someone has a really good theory.

623
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,340
Speaker 1: Positions of the gas and the poop in the intestinal tract.

624
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,821
Speaker 0: Google.

625
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,045
Speaker 0: Yahoo answers.

626
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:22,807
Speaker 0: Question.

627
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:26,760
Speaker 0: Why do tiny silent farts smell worse than big, loud farts?

628
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,939
Speaker 0: This was asked six years ago by Roller Coaster of Love.

629
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,547
Speaker 0: The accepted answer was a long one.

630
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:38,120
Speaker 0: that actually kind of makes sense when you're really flatulent with huge ripping farts.

631
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:45,760
Speaker 0: The main gas is mostly carbon dioxide, since the big ones are some sugar fermenting in your intestines, et cetera.

632
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,559
Speaker 0: Carbon dioxide is odorless, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

633
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,480
Speaker 0: If you have a small fart, it's methane and sulfides from different kinds of fermentation.

634
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,759
Speaker 1: The sulfides are definitely where the odors come from, that's for sure.

635
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,682
Speaker 1: Yep.

636
00:29:58,702 --> 00:29:59,900
Speaker 1: Methane doesn't smell like anything.

637
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,279
Speaker 0: But I'm going to admit something.

638
00:30:01,861 --> 00:30:09,260
Speaker 1: Wait, but does that mean... We see a lot of people on YouTube making asses of themselves trying to set their farts on fire and actually setting their assholes on fire.

639
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:16,160
Speaker 1: If they used a big carbon dioxide fart, they would actually put the fart fire out and not start it.

640
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:16,842
Speaker 0: Exactly.

641
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:20,220
Speaker 0: So I think you need a large quantity of the smelly fart to make that happen.

642
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,209
Speaker 0: Also, guys, never try to light your fart.

643
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,360
Speaker 0: You're going to set something on fire, probably your junk.

644
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,740
Speaker 1: Do light a cow's fart on fire, because I want to see that shit on YouTube.

645
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:33,657
Speaker 0: I kind of don't.

646
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,519
Speaker 1: Why not?

647
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,080
Speaker 0: Why not just make a flamethrower with hairspray?

648
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:39,380
Speaker 1: Also awesome.

649
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did that at band camp.

650
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,280
Speaker 1: But I've seen that before.

651
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,060
Speaker 0: And then my hairspray got taken away.

652
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,680
Speaker 1: But how funny would it be to stand next to a cow with like a lighter and then boom, you light your hick friend on fire.

653
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,360
Speaker 0: Or you light yourself on fire because you're the one right next to it.

654
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:56,194
Speaker 1: Or use that to light bottle rockets, which then fire off.

655
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,940
Speaker 1: That is like the combo there.

656
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,598
Speaker 0: Are the bottle rockets themselves positioned in someone's butt?

657
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:03,118
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

658
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:04,859
Speaker 1: You remember that video.

659
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,280
Speaker 1: So there's a guy who's got a bottle rocket coming out of his butt and he's butt to butt with the cows.

660
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,346
Speaker 1: He's butt rape.

661
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,179
Speaker 1: Fucking the cow butts together.

662
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,140
Speaker 0: Butts together is not necessarily rape.

663
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,833
Speaker 0: The butts are fucking.

664
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:17,359
Speaker 0: It's just butts.

665
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:19,300
Speaker 1: His butt and the cow's butt are pretty close.

666
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,590
Speaker 1: You pull the match near the cow's butt.

667
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,112
Speaker 1: It farts.

668
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,540
Speaker 1: It sets the bottle rocket on fire.

669
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,880
Speaker 1: The bottle rocket shoots into the air and explodes.

670
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,920
Speaker 0: It's like the best or the worst Rube Goldberg machine ever.

671
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,819
Speaker 0: So you remember that video.

672
00:31:33,063 --> 00:31:34,317
Speaker 0: This is from the old Blumpy.org.

673
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Speaker 0: Like the videos you keep around before YouTube of the guy who tries to launch a bottle rocket out of his butt.

674
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,140
Speaker 0: Which apparently seems to be a common tradition among.

675
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,678
Speaker 1: Bad fucking idea again.

676
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,919
Speaker 0: You realize guys, when you do that, you're going to clench up as soon as they light it.

677
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,700
Speaker 0: Because you're going to, because you're getting sparks.

678
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,780
Speaker 1: And that splintery wooden stick that consists of the shaft of the bottle rocket will leave its splinters all along your record.

679
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,100
Speaker 0: More importantly, you clench up because the sparks are hitting your butt and it hurts a little bit.

680
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:02,980
Speaker 0: As a result, the bottle rocket does not leave.

681
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,400
Speaker 0: It just flame throwers your butt for three seconds and then explodes.

682
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,120
Speaker 1: Splinters your rectum from the rod of the bottle rocket.

683
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,500
Speaker 0: Having seen many videos, no one ever successfully does this.

684
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,179
Speaker 1: I don't want any wooden splinters in my rectum.

685
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:21,180
Speaker 0: I'm more worried about the stream of fire followed by the explosion.

686
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,290
Speaker 1: Alright, you have two choices.

687
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,180
Speaker 1: Choice number one.

688
00:32:23,764 --> 00:32:26,000
Speaker 1: I will take a fire and blow it on your butt for a little bit.

689
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:28,658
Speaker 1: Choice number two.

690
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,660
Speaker 0: It's not a fire, it's a rocket propellant directed directly at your taint.

691
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:35,620
Speaker 0: Or your genitals.

692
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,840
Speaker 1: Choice number one, I blast some sparks at your taint for like a few seconds.

693
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,340
Speaker 1: Choice number two, I take a splintery piece of wood, shove it in your ass and pull it out.

694
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,679
Speaker 0: It's so thin, it's not that bad I don't think.

695
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,039
Speaker 1: Splintery piece of wood.

696
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,159
Speaker 0: Because it's so thin you wouldn't even notice.

697
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:50,479
Speaker 1: Urethra.

698
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:53,420
Speaker 0: Thanks for that.

699
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:56,499
Speaker 0: But I'm going to admit something.

700
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:01,580
Speaker 0: I actually enjoy the moments where I have to fart and I can't hold it in.

701
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:03,238
Speaker 0: There's no way I could hold it in.

702
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,457
Speaker 1: And you let it out and go ahh.

703
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:05,760
Speaker 0: But I'm on the subway.

704
00:33:07,244 --> 00:33:08,318
Speaker 0: And it's an express train.

705
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:15,220
Speaker 0: And once I fart, because it's always silent, no one ever suspects that I'm the one who farted.

706
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,900
Speaker 0: I'm always like the businessman, I'm skinny, I'm wearing like a fashionable jeans and a blazer or something.

707
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,800
Speaker 0: I always see this, I fart, everyone in the subway cars are like going.

708
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:28,739
Speaker 0: And they have to look and they look around to guess who.

709
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:33,860
Speaker 0: And I will always see everyone else in the subway car basically stare at the fattest person on the car.

710
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,160
Speaker 1: I never see anyone on the subway even care if anyone farts, this is interesting.

711
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,280
Speaker 0: Well it's only if, so it doesn't happen that often.

712
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,080
Speaker 0: It's if I fart on the subway and it's a dangerous one.

713
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,679
Speaker 1: Everyone just moves to the next car.

714
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:48,720
Speaker 0: No one moves for a fart, you move for the hobo.

715
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,360
Speaker 0: Because the hobo doesn't disperse.

716
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,479
Speaker 1: He's a walking fart.

717
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,700
Speaker 0: If you fart, the fart goes away.

718
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,700
Speaker 0: But if you're hobo, the hobo does not disperse.

719
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,160
Speaker 0: It doesn't diffuse into the car and go away until the cops come.

720
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,673
Speaker 0: But I enjoy that moment and it's a bad thing to enjoy.

721
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:12,559
Speaker 0: where everyone smells the fart, they're angry about the fart, and they all assume the fat guy did it.

722
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,918
Speaker 0: And no one ever suspects that it was me who farted.

723
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:16,498
Speaker 1: You know what bothers me a lot?

724
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,893
Speaker 1: It's these people who act like.

725
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:18,460
Speaker 1: they never fart.

726
00:34:18,844 --> 00:34:19,320
Speaker 1: Like my mom.

727
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:22,639
Speaker 1: My mom will be like, she'll deny that she farts.

728
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,980
Speaker 1: But one time we were in the kitchen in grandma's house in Florida and it was just me and my mom.

729
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,978
Speaker 1: And there was a fart noise and it wasn't me.

730
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,639
Speaker 1: There was only one other person in that room.

731
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,190
Speaker 0: There's a Bill Cosby bit.

732
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,480
Speaker 0: that's basically exactly that.

733
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,473
Speaker 0: The mom's like, "I never

734
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:36,797
Speaker 0: fart."

735
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:38,800
Speaker 0: And she tries to fart while she's laughing.

736
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:40,797
Speaker 0: And they call her on it.

737
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:43,958
Speaker 0: And she hits them all because that's how Bill Cosby humor works.

738
00:34:45,422 --> 00:34:47,260
Speaker 1: But yeah, stop denying farting.

739
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:48,536
Speaker 1: Embrace that farting.

740
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:50,360
Speaker 0: Well, farting's important.

741
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,600
Speaker 0: If you don't fart, that sucks.

742
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:52,699
Speaker 0: Just fart.

743
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,400
Speaker 0: Just go for it.

744
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:56,480
Speaker 1: I had a wise bus driver in my public school days.

745
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
Speaker 1: You know what the wise bus driver said?

746
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:58,819
Speaker 0: Everybody farts.

747
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,199
Speaker 1: Everybody shits the same.

748
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,498
Speaker 1: It all smells the same.

749
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,820
Speaker 0: People with Crohn's disease don't shit the same.

750
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,140
Speaker 1: Everybody shits and it all smells like shit.

751
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:07,737
Speaker 1: That's the point.

752
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,920
Speaker 1: Crohn's people still shit, do they not?

753
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,000
Speaker 0: So Scott, I'm going to ask you a question.

754
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:14,980
Speaker 0: I'm going to ask you a personal question that I will also answer truthfully.

755
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:18,780
Speaker 0: If you ever farted and it actually kind of smelled good.

756
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:19,636
Speaker 1: No.

757
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:20,260
Speaker 1: Never?

758
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:20,712
Speaker 1: No.

759
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,859
Speaker 0: You've never experienced that.

760
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,920
Speaker 1: It either smells like nothing or it smells like poop, which doesn't smell good.

761
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:32,478
Speaker 1: I mean, there are things that smell, I will sell you, there are things, there are things that smell worse than poop.

762
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:32,957
Speaker 0: Okay.

763
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:34,830
Speaker 0: So I typed, "Why do my,".

764
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,258
Speaker 0: and I was about to type, "farts smell

765
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:36,540
Speaker 0: good."

766
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,977
Speaker 0: And Google recommended, "Feet smell, nipples hurt, nipples

767
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:40,278
Speaker 0: itch.".

768
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:40,915
Speaker 1: Okay.

769
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:47,800
Speaker 1: But the point is I'm making here is that there are things like, I would rather smell a fart than like a secondhand smoke.

770
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,640
Speaker 0: Why do my farts smell so bad, smell so good?

771
00:35:50,223 --> 00:35:50,374
Speaker 0: Burn.

772
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,300
Speaker 1: Well, burning is bad.

773
00:35:53,182 --> 00:35:54,799
Speaker 1: That's the doctor's situation right there.

774
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:56,060
Speaker 0: Okay.

775
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,700
Speaker 0: It seems like it's equal quantities.

776
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,060
Speaker 0: My farts smell bad, my farts smell good.

777
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,640
Speaker 1: Did you eat flowers?

778
00:36:02,842 --> 00:36:04,240
Speaker 1: That would help your farts smell good.

779
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,180
Speaker 1: Did you shove flowers in your ass?

780
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:07,400
Speaker 1: That would probably work as well.

781
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,207
Speaker 1: Did you...

782
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:08,774
Speaker 0: Okay.

783
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,192
Speaker 1: Is there soap remnants in your butt crack?

784
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:12,620
Speaker 1: that would probably make it smell like soap?

785
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:19,940
Speaker 0: So I have learned the answer, and the answer is, Yahoo Answers is a treasure trove of some of the saddest people in the world.

786
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,560
Speaker 1: How is baby formed?

787
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,300
Speaker 1: How is fart smell good?

788
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,280
Speaker 1: Way insane, mother.

789
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,365
Speaker 1: Way insane.

790
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:28,000
Speaker 1: rectum, fart blasting, I don't know.

791
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:31,590
Speaker 1: What is the answer?

792
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,970
Speaker 0: It was long and I stopped reading it.

793
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:34,569
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

794
00:36:34,811 --> 00:36:38,430
Speaker 0: I'm back to why do tiny silent farts smell worse than big loud farts?

795
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,889
Speaker 1: Did you ever get an answer on that?

796
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:45,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was the carbon monoxide, or carbon dioxide thing seems to be the common answer.

797
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:53,410
Speaker 1: Do you ever, do you think, right, people always say beans, the musical fruit, the more you eat, the more you do?

798
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,070
Speaker 0: I have never farted more or less after eating any particular food in my entire life.

799
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,829
Speaker 1: I have not tracked it, right, mathematically speaking.

800
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,970
Speaker 0: People say the food I ate led to farting unless it was McDonald's breakfast.

801
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:14,528
Speaker 1: But I think what really contributes to my personal farting, right, is a problem I have of eating too fast and not chewing enough, right, because when you eat fast and don't chew enough.

802
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,389
Speaker 0: You do basically just shovel food in your mouth and swallow it immediately.

803
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,429
Speaker 0: I've watched you eat.

804
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,650
Speaker 1: You have big chunks of food with air in between.

805
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,965
Speaker 1: You end up swallowing air.

806
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:27,110
Speaker 0: So I think that- No, you don't end up swallowing air if you're a normal human being.

807
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:28,889
Speaker 0: You end up swallowing air.

808
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:31,710
Speaker 0: The direct, literal you, not the royal you.

809
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:32,470
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

810
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:38,370
Speaker 0: So I'm saying- You eating is like, oh, no, you're just like swallowing gallons of air next to your food.

811
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:43,050
Speaker 1: The air just goes in your esophagus and the big chunks of food sort of trap it in there.

812
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,550
Speaker 0: But usually that doesn't cause farting.

813
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,182
Speaker 0: It causes gas.

814
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,029
Speaker 1: Your esophagus pushes it down.

815
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:48,603
Speaker 1: Yeah.

816
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:53,108
Speaker 1: It causes burping if the air actually makes it back up the esophagus past the food.

817
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,530
Speaker 0: How fast are you eating to force that air into your intestine before you burp it out?

818
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,390
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

819
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:06,529
Speaker 1: And that is a contributor to non-smelly farts because it's just air coming out and not say nasty sulfates or methane or who knows what.

820
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,330
Speaker 1: And it's bad for my stomach.

821
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:08,970
Speaker 0: All right.

822
00:38:09,231 --> 00:38:10,930
Speaker 0: Does swallowing air make you fart?

823
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:13,510
Speaker 0: All right.

824
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,188
Speaker 0: There's an Ask Men article about this.

825
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:15,743
Speaker 1: Okay.

826
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:18,430
Speaker 0: If you swallow a burp, does it turn into a fart?

827
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,450
Speaker 0: There's Yahoo answers coming to the table.

828
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,130
Speaker 1: There's not one answer from a gastroenterologist.

829
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,630
Speaker 0: Resolved question.

830
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:31,110
Speaker 0: The answer is a joke about farting with bad grammar.

831
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:31,387
Speaker 0: All right.

832
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,590
Speaker 0: This guy just said no, but his name is Jalapeno Baby Canada.

833
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,248
Speaker 1: Okay, fine.

834
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,629
Speaker 1: How about these fart jokes?

835
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,250
Speaker 1: Why are fart jokes funny for children and still funny for adults?

836
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,869
Speaker 0: Because everyone does fart.

837
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:54,989
Speaker 0: So no matter how stoic and noble and Mitt Romney and just perfect history you are, if you're standing there and someone farts, you think back to all the times you farted.

838
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:56,290
Speaker 1: Why is that funny?

839
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,308
Speaker 0: I don't know.

840
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,769
Speaker 0: The same reason poop is funny.

841
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,729
Speaker 0: There's a certain ... Monkeys seem to find these things enjoyable too.

842
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,002
Speaker 1: Why have we evolved?

843
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:19,933
Speaker 1: Why have the monkeys that thought poop was funny and were not afraid to fling poo better at surviving and evolving than the monkeys who are perhaps afraid of poo or did not like poo?

844
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:20,724
Speaker 0: Farting.

845
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,929
Speaker 1: How did the humor of poo add to survival?

846
00:39:27,553 --> 00:39:30,185
Speaker 0: Swallowing air in the usual ...

847
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:31,250
Speaker 1: Get a Yahoo answer for that.

848
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:38,210
Speaker 0: So supposedly swallowing air can cause flatulence to ... All right.

849
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,370
Speaker 0: These answers are way too complicated.

850
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:43,169
Speaker 1: At least that means maybe they're true or not.

851
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,348
Speaker 0: Or not.

852
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,308
Speaker 1: Do you have anything else to say about farting?

853
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:49,249
Speaker 0: One last thing.

854
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:56,970
Speaker 0: Because I have an Aeron chair, farting in my chair is no longer an issue because the farts just go through it instead of lingering forever.

855
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,970
Speaker 1: I don't think farts really ... In the fabric.

856
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,690
Speaker 1: Farks don't linger in my chair.

857
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,057
Speaker 0: If you fart in a chair that is fabric, the smell lingers in the chair for a while, not You smell my ...

858
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:07,230
Speaker 1: My chair doesn't smell like poop.

859
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:09,850
Speaker 0: How often do you fart into it?

860
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:10,468
Speaker 1: I don't know.

861
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,670
Speaker 1: I fart whenever I fart.

862
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:18,590
Speaker 0: Plus when you fart into a chair, don't you usually raise the cheek a little bit to get a sort of freer delivery?

863
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:19,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

864
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:20,270
Speaker 1: Yeah.

865
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:20,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

866
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:26,028
Speaker 0: When you fart in bed, do you lift the sheet and kind of go flaf flaf, parachute to get it out of there?

867
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:27,045
Speaker 1: You know what I do do?

868
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,062
Speaker 1: Do you?

869
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:28,583
Speaker 1: No.

870
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:32,950
Speaker 1: The worst is if you're in the shower because the curtain and the humidity will keep the fart.

871
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,370
Speaker 1: So what I do is I have to fart in the shower, which actually happens rather often.

872
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,710
Speaker 0: I will stick my butt out of the shower and fart into the room.

873
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,510
Speaker 1: I will crack the edge of the curtain and stick my butt out and fart into the main bathroom.

874
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:43,369
Speaker 0: I do the same thing.

875
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:43,770
Speaker 1: Okay.

876
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:44,468
Speaker 0: Same thing.

877
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,810
Speaker 0: I do like the resonance of the fart in the room.

878
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:55,510
Speaker 1: I've noticed there's a lot of things like that where it's like you do them and it's like you think it's a weird thing, but really everyone does it.

879
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:55,752
Speaker 1: Like.

880
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:57,050
Speaker 0: that's why the humor is funny.

881
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,546
Speaker 0: Like, you know what?

882
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,399
Speaker 1: Like one time I asked a group of people, I was like, yeah, am I the only one who shampoos my you know, pubes.

883
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,770
Speaker 1: and they're like, no fucking everyone shampoos their pubes.

884
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,250
Speaker 0: I shampoo them.

885
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,990
Speaker 0: I condition them and I comb them.

886
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:09,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

887
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,670
Speaker 1: It's like fucking everyone does that.

888
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,849
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, I'm not alone.

889
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:12,664
Speaker 0: Scott.

890
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,666
Speaker 0: Everyone has to wash the inside of their ass when they're showering.

891
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:20,228
Speaker 1: there was so I thought other people just soaked it and I was the only one shampoo in it.

892
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:22,790
Speaker 0: I used to condition and shampoo.

893
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,829
Speaker 0: My mustache.

894
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,150
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

895
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,110
Speaker 0: It's a little weird, but you never had a mustache.

896
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,105
Speaker 1: I have one right now.

897
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,350
Speaker 0: That is barely a mustache.

898
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:35,372
Speaker 0: I've get one like I had at RIT and you're going to, yeah, cause you didn't condition it.

899
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:38,710
Speaker 1: It's also hot out right now.

900
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,049
Speaker 1: So I'm going to probably reduce a lot.

901
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:51,710
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about, you know, maybe I'll do another reset just cause my face, I actually tried a new facial hair that I posted a picture of the look pretty okay on me, but it made me look silly and possibly communist.

902
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,870
Speaker 1: The problem is I feel like there've been enough men in the history of the world.

903
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,029
Speaker 1: They've already tried every possible facial hair.

904
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,789
Speaker 0: That's why you have names.

905
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:58,343
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

906
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:58,741
Speaker 0: Yeah.

907
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:10,285
Speaker 1: Pretty much anything I can possibly try is either going to be, you know, normal hipster evil doofy or like, you know, what make me look like some, you know, every time

908
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:16,648
Speaker 0: you get a beard going on, cause I get beards going on kind of off and just cause I don't, I don't shave for whatever reason.

909
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:24,239
Speaker 0: Once it's long enough and I got to get rid of it, I will shave it down into like five different possible facial hairstyles.

910
00:42:24,601 --> 00:42:31,649
Speaker 0: as I shave down and I'm slowly building a lexicon of facial hair configurations that if I wanted to have them would look okay on me.

911
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not too many there.

912
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:44,829
Speaker 0: I got, I tried one that looked pretty good cause it, it highlights my eyebrows if I want to do good, funny faces like in YouTube videos or while I'm describing anecdotes, we've moved from farts to beards.

913
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,568
Speaker 1: So I think it's time.

914
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,490
Speaker 1: I think it's time to go biking.

915
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,020
