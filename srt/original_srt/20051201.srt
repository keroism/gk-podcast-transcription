1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,274
Speaker 1: It's Thursday December 1st, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:16,239
Speaker 1: We talk about geek nights.

3
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:19,617
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:26,300
Speaker 0: So I get to work this morning and the boss has this extra LCD monitor on his desk.

5
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:30,350
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and he says some user did something.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,313
Speaker 0: I thought was impossible.

7
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:34,040
Speaker 0: He burned an image onto the screen of an LCD monitor.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,527
Speaker 0: Really now I'm like wait a minute.

9
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:40,304
Speaker 0: that can't be because the way an LCD monitor works How can that be?

10
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:44,279
Speaker 0: that would mean that like the memory chip had to have the same?

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,507
Speaker 0: Frame stored in it and then it had to be a memory chip that saved the state like a flash or a hard drive And that's not what it is.

12
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,139
Speaker 1: So was there actually an image there?

13
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,330
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't an image burned into the screen.

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,946
Speaker 0: My boss just said that but it was very broken Very broken.

15
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,293
Speaker 0: you turn this thing on.

16
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:10,562
Speaker 0: the screen went white heat white and Gradually the top of it got dark dark dark and then the middle of it got dark and then the sign there were these colored Lines.

17
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:11,648
Speaker 0: all it was broken as hell.

18
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:22,840
Speaker 0: Wow, so we opened it all the way and took out every piece and I knew how LCD monitors worked before but now I have a much much better understanding.

19
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:26,574
Speaker 1: You are aware that there are various carcinogens and things in there.

20
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:27,859
Speaker 0: right and an LCD?

21
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:31,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, not as bad as a CRT, but the you shouldn't open them.

22
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:34,877
Speaker 0: Well, let me explain to you what's in there.

23
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:38,044
Speaker 0: first You take off the plastic.

24
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:41,595
Speaker 0: All right, and then there's the LCD screen itself.

25
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:51,285
Speaker 0: The LCD screen is maybe one quarter of a millimeter thick and it has this little circuit board attached to it and one side of it is the side.

26
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:59,139
Speaker 0: that's the front of the actual front of your screen and the other side of is ultra shiny and Awesome like your screen was when you bought it and I kind of wish that side was facing out.

27
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:01,790
Speaker 0: But anyway, and that's the screen.

28
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,279
Speaker 0: the rest of it is all the other stuff.

29
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:06,232
Speaker 0: it's pretty crazy.

30
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:11,233
Speaker 0: and Beyond the LCD screen are these two really thin pieces of plastic.

31
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,179
Speaker 0: They're like kind of lens filter II things.

32
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,707
Speaker 0: But they're you know, like.

33
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:16,214
Speaker 0: what are those lenses with the circles?

34
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:17,360
Speaker 0: What are they called?

35
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:27,032
Speaker 0: They used to magnify stuff on the beach and stuff what you mean a magnifying glass Plastic sheets that are lens.

36
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:28,120
Speaker 0: Oh Fresno Fresno.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,083
Speaker 0: It's like one of those.

38
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,408
Speaker 0: only imagine if it's like.

39
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,847
Speaker 0: the grooves are so fine and precise And there's millions of them all over the place.

40
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:36,389
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,719
Speaker 0: And then there's another one that's kind of white to keep the color straight.

42
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,406
Speaker 0: and Then there's this piece of plastic.

43
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:46,540
Speaker 0: That's like three-quarters of an inch thick just a big hunk of plastic.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,267
Speaker 0: That's the size of the screen.

45
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:56,420
Speaker 0: It's freaking huge and all that piece of plastic does is Take light in the top and send it straight out the front in an even square.

46
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:06,333
Speaker 0: The light is yes he's too thin sticks of light bulb that go inside this thing at the top and shoot down into the piece of plastic from the top.

47
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:23,919
Speaker 0: and That's the whole thing except for the power supply and a very very tiny circuit board that translates VGA into an array of LCD Controlling electricity, uh-huh, because I did want to smash open a CRT and there's a lot of complex tiny machinery in there.

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, and LCD is freaking simple as hell.

49
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:29,700
Speaker 0: That's why laptop, you know that they can just frickin stick them on there.

50
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:30,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're really.

51
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,440
Speaker 0: I mean, they're so expensive.

52
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:40,029
Speaker 0: But the expensive part is just that LCD screen because there's some stuff in it That's like rare or hard to get or something.

53
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,780
Speaker 1: but and yields they've gotten a lot better, but they're still not perfect.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:57,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean the rest of it is like a piece of plastic some light bulbs two very simple cheap-ass circuits and like some buttons is Actually, you know really interesting this pictures on my flicker actually of the pieces of plastic and lenses and huh?

55
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,846
Speaker 0: My co-worker holding the LCD part.

56
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:08,900
Speaker 1: because I can tell you one thing if you ever decide to smash open a CRT bad idea That glass is a lot thicker than you think it is and you're not gonna break it no matter how hard you try.

57
00:04:09,422 --> 00:04:20,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't actually break the part that had the liquid crystal in it, you know, okay That's what I'm saying is you'll see the LCD is just this very very thin thing That is just as liquid crystal in it.

58
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:21,274
Speaker 0: You don't?

59
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:22,220
Speaker 0: we didn't break it.

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,333
Speaker 0: We just took all the layers of the actual monitor out.

61
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:31,960
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, you know It'd be like equivalent if I opened up a CRT and looked around as opposed to press smashing it.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but imagine if a CRT wasn't a tube.

63
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,120
Speaker 0: It was a bunch of layers of things.

64
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,180
Speaker 0: You took the piece of glass off and then you took whatever was behind the glass off and then there was something else there.

65
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:43,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, it's it's very cool All right.

66
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:48,106
Speaker 0: So remember that a photo guy who they Vigilante eat.

67
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:52,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently the guy they vigilante Got gotten.

68
00:04:53,064 --> 00:05:05,310
Speaker 0: Well, the the story is is that number one that did hurt their business when they were vigilante, which is good - the reason that this whole thing started which I wasn't 100% clear on was The guy had been shopping for the camera.

69
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,350
Speaker 0: He found the good price on their website and When he tried to order it They didn't want to sell it to him for that price.

70
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,106
Speaker 0: And when he said I demand it for that price I won't negotiate with you.

71
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:19,200
Speaker 0: They said we're out of stock lying that they were out of stock.

72
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:27,560
Speaker 0: Yep, so, you know, he got pissed and he was fighting not with the owner of the company But with an employee named Steve Phillips, right?

73
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,657
Speaker 0: The owner of the company the this the president is the owner of price right photo.

74
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:40,455
Speaker 0: ed lopez emailed the guy Apologized, you know said a bunch of you know, I guess nice.

75
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:44,368
Speaker 0: Okay things Told him that you know, it was all.

76
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:48,200
Speaker 0: they fired Steve Phillips and everything and you know, it's supposedly a happy ending.

77
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:55,280
Speaker 0: The one thing though is that they're like the company seems to be acting like Steve Phillips was the only one doing that BS crap.

78
00:05:56,027 --> 00:06:05,798
Speaker 0: But According to you know people on forums who posted things about price right photo long before this happened You know had complaints about the same thing from other people.

79
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:08,464
Speaker 0: Yep Policy that's now gone.

80
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:13,220
Speaker 1: They'd advertise the price but they only actually sell it to you if you bought a whole bunch of overpriced accessories.

81
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:16,579
Speaker 1: Yeah And if you didn't buy the accessories See, it's like Best Buy.

82
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:25,340
Speaker 1: Best Buy always has the loss leader and then they make their money because they sell, you know, the $30 USB cable And the monster power strip.

83
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, all that all that Randy bullshit.

84
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:33,300
Speaker 0: monster cables don't make it sound any better than no radio shack cables.

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,923
Speaker 0: They will make it so that you have to use less amplification to get the same volume unless you're using Minuscule amount.

86
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:44,573
Speaker 1: if you're using digital you can use a five cent cable.

87
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:44,854
Speaker 1: Yep.

88
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:45,555
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

89
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:46,498
Speaker 1: It's bits.

90
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,620
Speaker 1: Yep But uh at least with Best Buy they can't refuse to sell you the loss leader by itself.

91
00:06:53,461 --> 00:07:00,059
Speaker 1: They can try to make you not want to go into your store by making the store unpleasant to people with a brain But they can't really kick you out.

92
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:05,611
Speaker 0: I'm doing a real good job of making the store unpleasant to people with brains Except for the fact that we still shop there fairly often.

93
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:16,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't shop there So I go there to look buying rarely very rarely how we bought our DVD shelves there Then no place else had one DVD shelves like the hardest thing to get.

94
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:22,815
Speaker 1: yeah furniture stores either have really really Expensive ones that are not exactly what you need or they're so cheap.

95
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:26,710
Speaker 0: They just fall apart or they're ugly Yeah, or people have fancy ones that don't hold.

96
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,360
Speaker 0: I need to hold a great quantity in a small amount of space.

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,926
Speaker 0: No one has real efficient ones.

98
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,954
Speaker 1: Well, someone did Best Buy.

99
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:34,600
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't really that good.

100
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,491
Speaker 0: It was just the most efficient we could find.

101
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:37,075
Speaker 1: Yeah.

102
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:45,999
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay So, uh bell south, oh, yeah, my grandma has bell south DSL and you know She doesn't know how to use it.

103
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,324
Speaker 0: But other than that they suck.

104
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:58,701
Speaker 1: take heart in what I'm about to say because according to what I've read since then Pretty much the entire rest of the industry thinks this is batshit and is ignoring this guy as much as we're going to ignore this Guy,

105
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,979
Speaker 0: well, so they suck and now they said something that makes them suck worse.

106
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:15,580
Speaker 1: basically, they think that the way the internet should work is that say I'm an ISP I Should be able to offer to Yahoo the ability to pay money to me and in return I'll make Yahoo load faster than say Google.

107
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,167
Speaker 0: How's it gonna work?

108
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:25,300
Speaker 1: Oh Oh with some magic restructuring of basic internet architecture on a global scale.

109
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:45,240
Speaker 1: You know enforcing QoS and I mean QoS is kind of a good idea except for the fact that The moment you make a bit that says this packet is more important than any other packet Everyone's who's smart is gonna have all their packets have that bit and then every packet in the world I have that bit and then that's that it doesn't work anymore.

110
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:46,835
Speaker 0: Nope doesn't work.

111
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,600
Speaker 1: And this guy goes on and on and he makes silly analogies.

112
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:54,820
Speaker 1: He's just like the guy who said that the Utah guy who said that there should be a porn port.

113
00:08:55,142 --> 00:09:01,400
Speaker 1: This is someone who is in a high position Involving technology, but who does not understand the technology?

114
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:06,057
Speaker 1: He is actually responsible for and is trying to use it as though it's a different medium.

115
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:06,659
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

116
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,606
Speaker 0: Well, it's a big problem.

117
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:12,600
Speaker 0: is someone's a businessman and they think you know, they're trying to think of business things.

118
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,220
Speaker 0: So they just imagine stuff up and they know nothing about technology whatsoever.

119
00:09:16,943 --> 00:09:20,660
Speaker 0: So they'll think up any old business thing and they'll say oh, wouldn't it be great, you know?

120
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,980
Speaker 0: Look, these people are making money and they're using Ma the hardware that I own my wires to make their money.

121
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:28,602
Speaker 0: I should.

122
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:35,141
Speaker 0: I should be able to make money by charging them money because I'm not making enough money with these flat fees from Customers.

123
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,690
Speaker 1: he probably makes the most incorrect analogy ever regarding this.

124
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,880
Speaker 0: so he thinks some stuff up and then he invents, you know some Dream of how the technology works.

125
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:46,880
Speaker 0: But because he knows nothing is wrong.

126
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:52,540
Speaker 1: If I go to the airport, I can buy a coach standby ticket or a first-class ticket in the shipping business.

127
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,699
Speaker 1: I can get two-day air or six-day ground.

128
00:09:55,621 --> 00:10:01,822
Speaker 1: I don't think he realizes that I can go to an ISP and buy a very tiny pipe or an OC 48.

129
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:10,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, see that's the correct analogy to that You know, but the funny thing is the Bell South is lobbying on behalf of this.

130
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:14,579
Speaker 1: but because they don't understand it They're actually lobbying against themselves.

131
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:17,653
Speaker 1: They're they're lobbying in Congress.

132
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:18,600
Speaker 1: right now in the house.

133
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,320
Speaker 1: There's a bill in the house that will prohibit network operators from impeding internet contents or impeding internet traffic based on content.

134
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:30,710
Speaker 1: So if I run an ISP and this bill is passed I won't be able to say slow down sites.

135
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,520
Speaker 1: I disagree with or block them just because I disagree with them.

136
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,222
Speaker 0: So it's a good law.

137
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:34,564
Speaker 0: We want.

138
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:35,286
Speaker 1: yes, it's a good law.

139
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:38,538
Speaker 1: All right, he is supporting the law because he says that.

140
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,100
Speaker 1: And this is fantastic.

141
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,753
Speaker 1: What I envision doesn't impede anyone.

142
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,240
Speaker 1: it just speeds other people up.

143
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:47,911
Speaker 0: You realize my speeding one person up.

144
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:49,038
Speaker 0: You're slowing another one down.

145
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:51,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, it can't go.

146
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:54,446
Speaker 0: right now Everything goes as fast as it can possibly go.

147
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:58,318
Speaker 0: The only way to make one person go faster is to slow other people.

148
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,180
Speaker 0: you can't understand technology.

149
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:06,787
Speaker 0: there should be a thing where like if you want to Like say some.

150
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,558
Speaker 0: if you want to legislate something you have to prove that you know about it.

151
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:10,883
Speaker 0: like.

152
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,950
Speaker 0: there should be a law that says the problem.

153
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:24,680
Speaker 0: any law that is that proposed that proposes any legislation that proposes something which is not Scientifically or technologically feasible is automatically void period.

154
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:27,284
Speaker 0: It would be so simple.

155
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:33,615
Speaker 1: You know what they're effectively void anyway, because even if the laws get passed there's no way to implement them.

156
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,829
Speaker 1: and Yeah, people who lose are the taxpayers who pay for it.

157
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,873
Speaker 0: I know but think about this.

158
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:44,326
Speaker 0: someone could make a law right that says Everyone Must go into outer space.

159
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:45,914
Speaker 0: Well, that's not technologically feasible.

160
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,240
Speaker 0: for everyone to go into outer space.

161
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,845
Speaker 0: I'm just thinking of something random and crazy.

162
00:11:49,006 --> 00:12:03,192
Speaker 0: Okay, but you know, of course, no one's gonna make this law, but someone could You know, we should have it in writing that if someone makes a law that's not technologically feasible That the law is void the whole thing just doesn't count.

163
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:07,731
Speaker 0: even if every congressperson voted for it Even if the president signed it doesn't matter.

164
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:10,283
Speaker 0: if it's technologically infeasible it doesn't count.

165
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:19,394
Speaker 1: the thing is there are a lot of crazies who would say things are technologically feasible when they aren't and We would say okay Yeah, we'd.

166
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:32,291
Speaker 0: someone would say the law that I'm proposing would say if Something in this is in dispute whether it is technologically feasible or not Someone must merely demonstrate the technological feasibility.

167
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:43,710
Speaker 0: if you can demonstrate it then you can have your law cannot demonstrate In the law a technical rundown of how to implement it even better.

168
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:52,317
Speaker 1: Actually, I think in many cases any law that requires someone to do shot something should either provide a means or provide a method to Do it.

169
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:59,305
Speaker 0: Yeah Because when you just say do this people do it and they do it some way that ends up making you bad and not.

170
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:05,848
Speaker 1: there's a law in Florida right now that If it passes will require Spanish to be taught in all schools all public schools.

171
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:10,370
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm All right, it doesn't provide any money to provide these classes.

172
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:15,553
Speaker 1: So these schools are probably gonna cut, you know art class or something to pay for it Great.

173
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, the federal government does that a lot though, too.

174
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,514
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of times.

175
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:25,723
Speaker 1: I'll pass a law that says you must do X and then they don't provide any money to do It and people do it shittily and then the government complains.

176
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,020
Speaker 0: the people really that's really a thing We need a constitutional amendment for.

177
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:38,189
Speaker 0: is any law you know that proposes action must provide the means and Instructions and how to execute that action?

178
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:43,450
Speaker 1: You know, the problem is the people who understand what we're saying are not the people in power.

179
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:44,952
Speaker 0: That is true.

180
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:50,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, they will be and the idea of a constitutional convention scares the living hell out of me.

181
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,217
Speaker 0: Constitutional convention bad.

182
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,307
Speaker 0: constitutional convention Scott equals airplane.

183
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:57,528
Speaker 0: Yes big airplane fast go.

184
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:04,369
Speaker 1: Because sure, I'm sure one or two good things would happen, but I imagine a lot of things would become very illegal very quickly.

185
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless we can go to the constitutional convention and make mischief maybe we could win out.

186
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:21,301
Speaker 0: huh See the problem is a constitutional convention isn't necessarily bad It's necessarily crazy and out of control and fickle.

187
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:24,510
Speaker 1: Yep, because we've never had one so we don't really know what would happen?

188
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't even really know how to do it.

189
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:35,750
Speaker 0: Well, there would be the this questions constitutional questions Like does the Congress decide when and where and who's allowed to be there and what can they do there?

190
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,810
Speaker 0: You know because technically it doesn't say you make a constitutional convention to write a new constitution.

191
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,540
Speaker 0: It says you can have a constitutional convention.

192
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,190
Speaker 0: is one of the ways to pass an amendment, right?

193
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,289
Speaker 0: But it doesn't say what's allowed there.

194
00:14:48,731 --> 00:15:00,723
Speaker 0: The question is can Congress limit what's allowed to be done at the Constitutional Convention like in Congress say this Constitutional Convention is only for the discussion of this amendment which pertains to this only?

195
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:08,158
Speaker 1: or furthermore the Supreme Court could well interpret how the Constitutional Convention is to carry it out.

196
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:16,662
Speaker 0: That's what would happen is the Supreme Court would have to decide if Congress Can limit what is talked about at the constitutional convention.

197
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,010
Speaker 0: and if they could limit what is talked about then?

198
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,529
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be so exciting because it would just be one amendment that gets made there.

199
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:35,049
Speaker 0: But if they couldn't if they could not if Congress does not have the power to specify what is done there Then even though they might go to originally talk about one amendment that a bunch of states decided to have a convention over.

200
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:42,618
Speaker 0: They could just start talking about random stuff and do whatever they wanted and No one could vote them out or stop them.

201
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:50,606
Speaker 0: or do it basically be a room full of people who would be Like a as a whole a council that rewrites the Constitution any way they please at least.

202
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,595
Speaker 1: the one thing is it's still a one Vote per state.

203
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'd have like 50 or 100.

204
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:59,904
Speaker 1: There's mostly red states even though there aren't so many people in them.

205
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:06,819
Speaker 0: Oh All right, so I'm gonna use the initial D music.

206
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,649
Speaker 1: right yeah, so there's that video game cheater guy.

207
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,309
Speaker 1: oh Yeah, this is great.

208
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:19,475
Speaker 1: There's this guy who had a video game cheating site and he claims that it's his soul is his primary source of income Apparently has ads on it or something.

209
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:24,537
Speaker 1: Okay, and he's suing someone who he claims stole the cheats from his site and put them on his own site.

210
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:29,620
Speaker 1: I Point out he's a public knowledge mostly even if they're not.

211
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,847
Speaker 1: I point out that how does he gonna press?

212
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:32,510
Speaker 1: the same is?

213
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:44,002
Speaker 1: Say someone put on their website an equation one plus five equals six and then I put that same equation on my website Because I derived it independently and then he sues me saying I stole it from him.

214
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:49,875
Speaker 0: if he can he might be able to prove That someone Did like.

215
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,848
Speaker 0: if he hasn't a web log of someone like?

216
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,310
Speaker 0: Snarfing his website and taking all his pages and uploading them to their website and proving that it's the same thing.

217
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,770
Speaker 0: You know, that's that's something right?

218
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:06,744
Speaker 0: But if he's talking about, you know He went to a site that happened to have cheats for the same game.

219
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,749
Speaker 0: go to game facts, man You're gonna sue game facts.

220
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:16,690
Speaker 1: But even if she was so the website in fact Even if someone stole the website verbatim if the website is generic enough It still really doesn't matter.

221
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,950
Speaker 0: Well, it depends if he creative commons to his website or if he didn't because if he didn't it's technically a copyright infringement.

222
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:29,290
Speaker 1: It's the website is just a collection of facts and all this and the presentation of the website has changed to where it's not identical.

223
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:30,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, then it's just a collection of.

224
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:34,510
Speaker 0: they would have to change the presentation significantly enough to where it's not infringing.

225
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:37,982
Speaker 1: However, what if the first website is just black text on a white background?

226
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:40,109
Speaker 1: then I can just a list of cheats.

227
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,321
Speaker 0: Then the guy doesn't have a leg to stand on.

228
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,050
Speaker 1: I don't think he has a leg to stand on anyway.

229
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,053
Speaker 0: No, he definitely doesn't.

230
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:51,430
Speaker 1: I think the saddest thing was the reporters talking about this case who don't know anything about it at all.

231
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:55,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like the guy who doesn't know anything about internet architecture from Bell South.

232
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:57,990
Speaker 1: Yeah reporters are starting to take me off lately.

233
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:02,873
Speaker 1: I mean when I was a little kid, I remember I'd read the newspaper and I'd always think like wow Oh, I didn't know that.

234
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:09,355
Speaker 1: but now I read the newspaper and I think I know that's untrue because I know about it Or that's not right.

235
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:10,781
Speaker 1: lie because I that quote.

236
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,709
Speaker 1: that's not that what that guy said I know.

237
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:20,809
Speaker 1: But then I started realizing that I Think every article is that way and anyone who's an expert in any field immediately sees that.

238
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:25,643
Speaker 0: yeah The problem is is they don't have a reporter who's an expert in everything.

239
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:26,084
Speaker 0: Nope.

240
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:30,817
Speaker 0: They have you know Reporters who are just guys who report.

241
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:35,330
Speaker 0: they don't know about any of the things they're reporting on which is why they do research and things.

242
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,784
Speaker 1: But a long time they only have fact-checkers and you couldn't say anything in the newspaper unless you had a.

243
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:40,627
Speaker 0: they still have.

244
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:45,590
Speaker 0: they still do Fact-check, you know, they don't do it quickly and they don't do it thoroughly.

245
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,853
Speaker 0: Oh So they don't do occurs.

246
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:50,425
Speaker 0: the fact-checkers also don't know if they give you.

247
00:18:50,545 --> 00:19:00,283
Speaker 0: if I wrote a highly technical Article and I'm a highly technical guy and I put it in a newspaper Who can fact-check that other than someone who's also very technical?

248
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,390
Speaker 0: so, you know, we'll get college professors to check it.

249
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,750
Speaker 1: Yes, the newspapers fact-finders job should be to find the fact and if they don't know it, they should find it somewhere.

250
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:17,930
Speaker 0: But then you won't get your story in today's paper and then it'll be a day late even though it's already 16 hours late because it happened, you know a long time ago and it's newspaper have everything.

251
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:24,069
Speaker 1: So maybe newspapers need to not go for the breaking news and go for the in-depth local news instead.

252
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:26,577
Speaker 0: Well, that's for the local newspapers.

253
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:35,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even for the national news instead of having an article that says holy shit Something happened in Congress have an article two days later that says here's exactly what happened in Congress two days ago.

254
00:19:35,992 --> 00:19:39,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then you know, what about the people who are dumb?

255
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,148
Speaker 0: they only read a newspaper the old people.

256
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,189
Speaker 0: they don't get the news fast.

257
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:46,089
Speaker 1: That seems to break every good business model.

258
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:53,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the the way cuz you know, why is the way you make money is by taking advantage of dumb people.

259
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,083
Speaker 0: Yeah And you don't have to do much to get money from them.

260
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:59,990
Speaker 0: if everyone was smart Then all the smart business models would work.

261
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:06,350
Speaker 0: Dumb business models wouldn't but because people are dumb dumb business models work and it sucks for the smart people.

262
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:12,163
Speaker 1: But at least in the newspaper case It doesn't matter because the average age of newspaper readers a year ago was 55 and this year.

263
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,531
Speaker 1: It's 56.

264
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,840
Speaker 0: Only old geezers read newspaper.

265
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not like funny in Soviet Whatever.

266
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:25,727
Speaker 1: only old people use email, but actually only old people read newspapers with rare exception.

267
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:35,900
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I mean if the average age is 55 I see that means For every 30 year old out there who reads the one.

268
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,830
Speaker 1: how many 70 year olds are there an equal number?

269
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:42,715
Speaker 1: No, not an equal number.

270
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:46,587
Speaker 0: well, you know a close enough number but not an equal number mr.

271
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,834
Speaker 0: Math It's good music.

272
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:53,106
Speaker 0: It is we're kind of giving up on the you know, a hundred percent.

273
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,470
Speaker 0: No stealing music thing.

274
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:57,590
Speaker 1: Well DJ pretzel never technically answered.

275
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,181
Speaker 1: I sent him two emails and he never answered.

276
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,230
Speaker 1: so I credited him and I just used his music.

277
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:07,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mike and I supremacy said we could use the music but we haven't used it yet because we just didn't.

278
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:07,790
Speaker 1: yeah.

279
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:14,288
Speaker 1: So if you ever just hear mock and I supremacy music for you know, 40 minutes on our podcast It means we really didn't have anything to say.

280
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:20,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you should go to their website and check out the music because they're awesome and they didn't pay me to say that They're just really that awesome.

281
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,557
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, so the things of the day.

282
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:24,421
Speaker 0: what's your thing of the day?

283
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:27,454
Speaker 1: I Expected you to go first.

284
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:28,519
Speaker 0: Well fine.

285
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:30,850
Speaker 0: All right, so so my thing.

286
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:40,849
Speaker 1: So in a Final Fantasy there were there was the potion item probably the most ubiquitous item in the game.

287
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you know 99 of them and they gave you 50 health.

288
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:45,644
Speaker 0: Gee, those are pretty useful.

289
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:52,508
Speaker 1: Well, uh in The fact that Final Fantasy 12 is coming out what kind of game is gonna be a one-player?

290
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:53,130
Speaker 0: What's it gonna mean?

291
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,685
Speaker 1: Oh, it's definitely not an online MMO.

292
00:21:55,786 --> 00:22:07,270
Speaker 1: That's good And a lot of people have mixed feelings about it But the real matter here is that it's costing a lot of money to make like insane amounts of money.

293
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:08,049
Speaker 0: That's about right.

294
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,350
Speaker 1: I've seen many articles to the fact that this is going to be possibly one of the most expensive to bruise games ever.

295
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,410
Speaker 1: Sounds right and they're having a little bit of trouble coming up with all this money.

296
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,109
Speaker 1: yep, so they are marketing the hell out of Final Fantasy.

297
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:26,588
Speaker 1: and Part of this marketing is they have now released potion the drink.

298
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,105
Speaker 0: Does it actually heal you?

299
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:33,868
Speaker 1: I imagine it's some sort of high fructose corn syrup carbonated concoction.

300
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:39,930
Speaker 1: I bet may I'll wager it's some sort of energy drink the sights in Japanese and there aren't many details out yet.

301
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:46,249
Speaker 1: Other than that the bottles look really really cool and I'll probably buy some just for that just for the bottle might be worth it If it's not too expensive.

302
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,761
Speaker 0: You know, I mean hell.

303
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:49,770
Speaker 0: I buy a cool bottle.

304
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:55,047
Speaker 1: Well considering that a Red Bull is 250 out of a vending machine at work.

305
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:59,339
Speaker 0: Really Wow Any of those things as I think they're poisoned.

306
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,330
Speaker 1: so I don't I love Red Bull, but it is kind of expensive.

307
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:04,761
Speaker 0: So I don't really know how much those things cost.

308
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:09,840
Speaker 0: Those are small little cans though - yeah Yeah, well, no wonder those freaking people are making a killing.

309
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:11,666
Speaker 0: That's how they afforded to buy that f1 team.

310
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:15,300
Speaker 0: Oh It contains some weird herbs in it.

311
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,006
Speaker 0: the potion is here.

312
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:22,553
Speaker 0: it contains hyssop Hyssop Uh-huh.

313
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:23,559
Speaker 1: I know that was.

314
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,209
Speaker 1: are you sure that wasn't hyssop be?

315
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:33,250
Speaker 0: Telest I'm sure but apparently I guess it's also got some sort of Randy herbal thing that doesn't really heal you.

316
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,030
Speaker 0: But I guess they kind of put it in there to make it more potion ish of healing.

317
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:38,784
Speaker 1: Well, you know what push be select.

318
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:42,356
Speaker 0: Yep All right, so my thing of the day.

319
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:44,684
Speaker 0: well, do you remember the SNES?

320
00:23:45,085 --> 00:23:46,309
Speaker 0: there was the super FX chip.

321
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:52,459
Speaker 1: I Remember even seeing ads where they talked about the super FS exact Super FX chip.

322
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:52,841
Speaker 1: Yep.

323
00:23:53,002 --> 00:24:07,430
Speaker 0: Well, the super FX chip was a chip they put in a few games starting with Star Fox and then stunt race FX and doom and a few other games that allowed the Super Nintendo to do, you know, very primitive vector polygon kind of graph very primitive.

324
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:09,597
Speaker 0: The Genesis also had a similar thing.

325
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:17,270
Speaker 0: they used for Virtua racing and what you know those early early early 3d games the stuff that came out before Virtua fighter won.

326
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely a step up from like mode 7.

327
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,150
Speaker 0: definitely a step up from mode 7.

328
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:31,750
Speaker 0: But anyway some if you ever played these games even in an emulator Star Fox and whatever is kind of jaggy in the frame rate sometimes even on an SNES.

329
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:49,510
Speaker 0: so some guy who knew about electronics took a Star Fox and he opened it up and he replaced a resonator with a 24 megahertz quartz crystal and Some capacitors and whatever and he basically overclocked his effect FX chip and got rid of the frame rate lag.

330
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:51,146
Speaker 1: that's kind of badass.

331
00:24:51,166 --> 00:25:00,899
Speaker 0: and there was a post where he says I think up here's that he shows pictures of all the stuff that's in the Cartridge and then he says this is what I plan to do.

332
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,486
Speaker 0: Let's see if it works at worst.

333
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,329
Speaker 0: It just won't boot.

334
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:05,798
Speaker 0: Because he's smart electronics guy.

335
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,249
Speaker 0: he did it and he said well my god it worked.

336
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:14,474
Speaker 0: He gets three to four more FPS, which is about all you need to get it You know to work better.

337
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:18,970
Speaker 0: because you know, it runs at about 25 FPS and your TV's about 30 something.

338
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:22,039
Speaker 0: So three to four just brings you right up to what you needed.

339
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,202
Speaker 0: to be damn.

340
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:25,730
Speaker 1: We couldn't do something similar with a dodgeball.

341
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:29,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's thinking about getting a better crystal to put in there like a 26 megahertz.

342
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:37,230
Speaker 0: That way you can get the like, you know Five or six maybe seven frames and he'll just be like a few frames over what a TV can do.

343
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,388
Speaker 0: So it'll always be perfect.

344
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,433
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

345
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:44,669
Speaker 0: I gotta say yeah, this is why I kind of want to know electronic stuff even though it's hard.

346
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,089
Speaker 1: So this is the last main bit that won't have music before the main bit starts.

347
00:25:51,852 --> 00:26:04,810
Speaker 0: Yep, and we decided that today we're gonna have a meta cast meta Which means if you are not knowing what meta means The podcast today is going to be about this podcast.

348
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:08,970
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when you're on slashdot and someone posts about slashdot.

349
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:10,477
Speaker 0: That's about it.

350
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:10,698
Speaker 0: Yeah.

351
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

352
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:17,409
Speaker 0: Yeah information about Information about the thing that it is within itself.

353
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:21,530
Speaker 1: So we just want to say to start we'll just get this right away.

Speaker 1: We know exactly how many of you there are who are not our.

358
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:41,526
Speaker 0: a lot of you are friends who already know us but we know a lot of people are listening who were complete strangers to us and We want to make like a fun happy community where we all can get together and geek out and such.

359
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:42,590
Speaker 0: see go to our website.

Speaker 0: Yeah join.

362
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:45,361
Speaker 1: so far.

363
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:47,730
Speaker 1: Only one of you was cool enough to try to post something.

364
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:49,742
Speaker 0: Yep, that guy's pretty cool.

365
00:26:50,044 --> 00:26:57,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, also I don't like you know these things where you vote to get people boosted up and promoted and whatever.

366
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:01,370
Speaker 0: but You know, I we kind of want people to listen.

367
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:09,985
Speaker 0: I mean it takes a lot of time to do this, even if it isn't particularly difficult and the more people listen the more worthwhile it would be.

368
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:20,869
Speaker 0: so Go to like podcast alley and those other places and like vote us up and put our links around And tell your friends and all that kind of good stuff.

369
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:28,946
Speaker 1: There are links are around enough already because I've noticed that if you search for geek nights on Google We're number one far above geek nights.

370
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:29,629
Speaker 1: calm.

371
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,276
Speaker 0: Well, it's cuz eat nice.

372
00:27:31,296 --> 00:27:37,238
Speaker 0: calm is some poop site and I went around like a bunch of pod Aggregators and put us up there.

373
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:40,910
Speaker 1: Yep, as did I I went to several to put us on there and you would already put us.

374
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:57,993
Speaker 0: yeah, now see the trick is we want people to find us if they search for geek podcast or Nighttime podcast or video game Geek podcast even though there's a bunch of video game specific podcast that'll beat us out, you know, but yeah get the idea All right.

375
00:27:58,755 --> 00:28:05,550
Speaker 0: The second thing we want to talk about is our content particularly Monday and Thursday.

376
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:07,333
Speaker 1: We're getting better.

377
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:08,938
Speaker 1: Well, we've been.

378
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:13,210
Speaker 1: we're forcing ourselves to actually have something good to talk about instead of just flubbing those two days.

379
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:20,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean originally I was kind of hoping that you know The geekeries are pretty much split into three general categories.

380
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:24,903
Speaker 0: There's board gaming role-playing Gay wargaming type stuff.

381
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:29,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, then there's Anime manga comics art type stuff.

382
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:32,810
Speaker 0: and then there's video games because video games are just that awesome that they you know.

383
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:38,619
Speaker 0: yeah, and then there's technologies and computers and all those sorts of things.

384
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:42,480
Speaker 0: is the fourth geekery, but You know, we don't.

385
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:46,663
Speaker 1: we can't really talk about No matter what we did involving science tech.

386
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:48,070
Speaker 1: we got complaints either.

387
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:52,527
Speaker 1: We talked about specific like computer things and half our listeners go what the hell?

388
00:28:52,547 --> 00:29:00,310
Speaker 1: Yeah We don't care about window managers or talk about science and that's boring to most of our listeners because we're not the most informative types.

389
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,474
Speaker 1: We're just interested in it.

390
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:10,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you know, we can't really talk too much about Bored role-playing war games because we play board games, but we tend to play the same ones over and over.

391
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:16,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you wanted we could talk about Tigers and Euphrates every week and never run out of stuff to talk about.

392
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just keep playing it and playing it.

393
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:24,034
Speaker 0: talk about you know game session reports and and new strategies and things until we eventually Solve the game.

394
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:36,249
Speaker 0: but you know, I mean we get new games occasionally But you know, we decided to lump those in on the video game day because video games don't come out every week You know, so you just made it game day and I think it works out pretty good.

395
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:46,757
Speaker 1: Yep and the same thing went with anime and manga and all that because I've noticed whenever we don't have a new anime to talk about we always have a new manga or new comic or if anything There's a bunch of anime news.

396
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:49,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm going to the comic book store every week now.

397
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:57,150
Speaker 0: So that should you know, even though I'm starting to because of this and other things I'm not actually reading all the comics as soon as I get them like I used.

398
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:07,435
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we got Netflix not too long ago and we had anime streaming in pretty much We would watch a DVD and mail it back that day and then get another one the next day and we had a movie Every single day no more.

399
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,885
Speaker 1: now now we're lucky to watch one a week.

400
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:18,719
Speaker 0: Yay podcast You know, but I did get a video game and that's you know Gonna eat up a bunch of my time and slow down comic read.

401
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:26,230
Speaker 0: Yeah pairing our geek content down to only two days You know, we were able to you know, always have fresh content guaranteed for those two days.

402
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:33,977
Speaker 0: but we decided we want to do a four day a week podcast and those other two days were kind of and You know, we have a few bits.

403
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:35,483
Speaker 0: We had like the geek fables bit.

404
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:36,748
Speaker 0: We have the.

405
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:37,330
Speaker 0: what are they?

406
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,953
Speaker 0: We had another bit.

407
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,030
Speaker 1: we had the how not to suck how not to suck bit.

408
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:45,508
Speaker 0: We had just stories stories bit but the stories originated as an end of the power.

409
00:30:45,549 --> 00:31:03,404
Speaker 0: still Experimenting with our general format, you know, even though it's pretty locked down into you know, something that happened today, you know news Items or interesting things on the internet and then the thing of the day and then the main Topic of depending what day of the week it is and then we're done.

410
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:04,750
Speaker 0: It's pretty solid.

411
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:05,695
Speaker 0: I think it works.

412
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:08,993
Speaker 0: if you don't think it works tell us Yeah, yep.

413
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,358
Speaker 0: Yep, you know pretty much.

414
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:12,787
Speaker 0: tell us anything that you think about the podcast.

415
00:31:12,887 --> 00:31:16,390
Speaker 1: negative positive We don't care because I mean we've had ideas like worst case.

416
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:22,734
Speaker 1: We might just only do Monday Tuesday Wednesday and then only do a Thursday when we have a reason to do a Thursday like an Interview or something.

417
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:23,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

418
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:25,850
Speaker 1: Once again, I got a bunch of cool people lined up to interview.

419
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,680
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of us getting around to doing it.

420
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,330
Speaker 1: So probably after the holiday season.

421
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:32,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's also the question of you know, what if we really had nothing?

422
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:35,035
Speaker 0: because for a few weeks We were really starving for?

423
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:37,587
Speaker 0: what do we do Thursday or what do we do Monday now?

424
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,846
Speaker 0: I think we have a little better handle on it this week maybe because of the Thanksgiving buffer we had.

425
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:46,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, but You know Would you rather have us?

426
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:51,226
Speaker 0: Still go over up to thing of the day and then just stop the podcast if you don't have anything?

427
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:55,545
Speaker 0: or do you rather have Us keep going and talk about something that may be kind of crappy and boring?

428
00:31:55,746 --> 00:32:00,350
Speaker 1: or more important We could probably always as long as we're a good forum come up with something.

429
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in the very least we have funny store.

430
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,168
Speaker 1: We have probably enough funny stories to fill this podcast out for a year.

431
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:11,646
Speaker 1: Probably the problem is days like today when we have plenty to talk about.

432
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:12,810
Speaker 1: We're just real tired.

433
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,158
Speaker 0: Yeah tiredness is.

434
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,210
Speaker 0: I guess that's part of the nighttime podcast.

435
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,906
Speaker 0: I mean letterman records his shows at like the middle of the morning like 10 a.m.

436
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:21,769
Speaker 0: Or something like that.

437
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:26,908
Speaker 0: There's a reason he doesn't actually do it at 11 p.m Whenever he's on TV.

438
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:31,946
Speaker 1: We had a plan where we were gonna record all the non time dependent stuff whenever we could like.

439
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:36,646
Speaker 1: if one weekend we were feeling Particularly good we do as many bits as we could and just cue them all up.

440
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:37,610
Speaker 0: We haven't done any of that.

441
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:42,750
Speaker 1: We did that once and then we immediately use them like two days later when Scott went out of town.

442
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:51,669
Speaker 1: Maybe we can and now we keep going out of town every weekend, so it's like yeah We're going out of town this weekend to play some board games Which is good because now we'll have stuff to talk about on board game day.

443
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:58,090
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe the week after that we won't do anything and I can actually do some computer work and we can get some podcast work in.

444
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:05,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we get one free weekend We'll pretty much be will polish up this podcast as far as it's gonna get polished.

445
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:08,161
Speaker 1: Yep, we need one more weekend of work and this thing will be gold.

446
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:09,787
Speaker 1: and this is gold as we're gonna be okay.

447
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:17,449
Speaker 0: So if you have we really want user input on our what our content is our format things we should talk about.

448
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:19,197
Speaker 0: so We don't care.

449
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:25,069
Speaker 1: We just want to hear things is right now We're not hearing anything even a post that says you suck and I hate you and I had sex with your mom.

450
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,201
Speaker 1: Yep, cuz I'm sure I'd like to know you can do that on the forum.

451
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,650
Speaker 0: You can also email us geek nights at Gmail.

452
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:41,985
Speaker 1: Yeah, so though I'll point out that to all you iTunes listeners out there and there's quite a few of you who probably have never Seen the website there's stuff on the website often in the comments.

453
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:45,217
Speaker 1: Well one on the website We had linked to everything we talked about.

454
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:45,940
Speaker 1: Yep.

455
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:49,673
Speaker 1: So if we talk about something you're curious about it We have a link there for you.

456
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:50,315
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

457
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:58,921
Speaker 1: and two there's comments by us and sometimes by other people on the actual Items in the feed for the podcast and that were.

458
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:01,990
Speaker 1: that's where we'll explain things like oh we screwed this podcast up.

459
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,054
Speaker 1: That's why it's so short.

460
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:07,835
Speaker 1: or rim fell asleep during it and Scott had to wake him up or you know Things like that.

461
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,590
Speaker 1: anything that happened that might be relevant.

462
00:34:10,012 --> 00:34:13,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to read those things because I think it you know, it enhances your experience.

463
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,139
Speaker 0: I mean I listen to a lot of podcasts.

464
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,489
Speaker 0: rim doesn't listen to any but now I will soon.

465
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:23,065
Speaker 1: Yes, I if I actually get the job information that I've been waiting for.

466
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:28,375
Speaker 0: I'm buying an iPod I'll sue but and a computer when I you know I listen to a podcast.

467
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:35,010
Speaker 0: if they have supporting information and cool stuff and a community on their website You know, it really makes it good for me.

468
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,130
Speaker 0: I really like that sort of thing and I think a lot of other people do also and we're trying to make that.

469
00:34:39,672 --> 00:34:41,360
Speaker 0: So if you you know, that's what you want.

470
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,485
Speaker 0: We've got it use it.

471
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:48,128
Speaker 0: All right Next thing we'll talk about is some of the technical issues with our pod.

472
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:57,480
Speaker 1: Yes Mainly Darth Scott in the fact that he breathes into the microphone An ambassador.

473
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:10,894
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, we have a shtick that we don't know why it won't end but randomly we just say We are not comic book guy, but somehow we still know every line from Star Wars.

474
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:14,947
Speaker 0: if this is a diplomatic mission Where is the ambassador?

475
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:18,077
Speaker 1: I always love that scene because he chokes the guy to death.

476
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:22,460
Speaker 0: Anyway, yep Darth Vader's just freaking cool in any episode.

477
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:28,300
Speaker 0: All right, so technical issues you have with the podcast.

478
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:30,324
Speaker 0: We don't.

479
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,259
Speaker 0: I'm not a professional radio guy and I talking to the microphone kind of yeah.

480
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:38,760
Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to sound mean because I had problems with my audio at first too, but I fixed all mine.

481
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,040
Speaker 1: I got a I got a pop filter here and I got a microphone stand and everything.

482
00:35:43,164 --> 00:35:53,940
Speaker 1: Yeah Scott lays on my futon with a microphone in his hand like squirming around pulling on the cable Talking into it funny rolling it around bumping into his face breathing on it.

483
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:57,310
Speaker 0: I think we'll buy a stand with a boom stick and it'll be all cool.

484
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,440
Speaker 0: Like yeah, maybe and then I can still lay down.

485
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,704
Speaker 0: I don't want to not lay down No seek.

486
00:36:04,126 --> 00:36:06,840
Speaker 1: I mean people could have pictured us sitting at a desk like on The Letterman Show.

487
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:20,940
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because you know what if people ever see us we will be sitting at a desk wearing nice blue suits white shirts and red ties, yeah, and As long as they don't see us, they'll just imagine that we're in this palace, which we do live in a palace.

488
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:22,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, honestly, we kind of do.

489
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:29,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's got turrets and and Port colors, we like port color.

490
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:30,620
Speaker 0: We have a port colors.

491
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have a moat with the dragon in it and inside the dragon is a laser.

492
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:35,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, generally.

493
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:37,682
Speaker 0: and the other thing is we all run Linux here So are?

494
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:40,014
Speaker 0: we don't have a large selection of audio software.

495
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:41,240
Speaker 0: is that causes a few problems?

496
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have audacity which is great at multitrack, but sucks at a lot of other things.

497
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,140
Speaker 1: We have resound.

498
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,706
Speaker 1: That's the closest thing to cool edit.

499
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:50,860
Speaker 1: I've ever been able to find for Linux, but it has some idiosyncrasies.

500
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,120
Speaker 0: There are other things like our door which we can get to work, but they're complicated and they're very powerful.

501
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,106
Speaker 0: But we have to learn them.

502
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:59,660
Speaker 0: So maybe we can get some success using those things.

503
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:07,257
Speaker 1: We got to work it out or honestly if anyone out there Happens to have a copy of cool edit Pro or cool edit 2000 for Windows.

504
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:16,086
Speaker 1: that was my favorite audio suite ever and I use that in all my digital audio classes and I made awesome stuff in it and I had pirated it.

505
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:19,760
Speaker 0: Yep, and then I lost it's on the guy in the train using it the other day.

506
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:21,628
Speaker 1: You should have asked him for it.

507
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, what are you gonna do?

508
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:31,840
Speaker 0: All right, so Now for those of you who are unfamiliar we're gonna talk about for the first time where this podcast came from.

509
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:40,765
Speaker 1: yeah, because it's kind of a. we Come up with ideas like this on a hourly basis Minute basis.

510
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:41,708
Speaker 1: we've had.

511
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:53,029
Speaker 0: I just came up with one thousands upon thousands of crazy But usually pretty viable ideas that we never acted upon Mostly because we didn't have the resources to execute them.

512
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:56,340
Speaker 0: the balls to execute them even though we have a lot of freakin balls.

513
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:56,899
Speaker 0: Yeah.

514
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:06,107
Speaker 0: But usually what happens is something either has you know a little bit of balls that we have but too much resources if you don't Too much balls and no resources.

515
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:08,274
Speaker 0: So we you know, it's more balls than anyone has.

516
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:08,897
Speaker 0: Yeah.

517
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:12,611
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway We finally found something we could do so we did it.

518
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:13,233
Speaker 1: Yep.

519
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,855
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember we were talking about it We should do it about three weeks before we actually started doing it.

520
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:18,679
Speaker 1: We said we should do it.

521
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:23,500
Speaker 1: We should try to ride this rising tide like the early webcomics did in and trench ourselves.

522
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,348
Speaker 0: Well, it's more like and then we didn't.

523
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:28,180
Speaker 0: it's more like surfing where it starts to break and then you're surfing.

524
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:35,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know the it really started way back in college with the with the pillow talk action.

525
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:42,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had this idea for a show because in college we shared a bedroom and what we didn't share a bed but we shared a bedroom

526
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:43,092
Speaker 0: yep,

527
00:38:43,678 --> 00:38:53,007
Speaker 1: and It was sad because I never got any sleep because we lay in bed and it'd be like 3 in the morning after we did all our geekery we lay in there and We just talked about.

528
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:55,500
Speaker 1: we pretty much do what we're doing now only without an audience.

529
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,477
Speaker 0: It was a great game called keep talking until the.

530
00:38:58,578 --> 00:39:09,499
Speaker 1: oh, yeah I can't really ignore you trying to sleep because I had a you know work the next morning or a class at 8 a.m And Scott would would say things to me and I'd try to just ignore him.

531
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:17,457
Speaker 1: pretend I was asleep, but he knew I was awake and he'd say more and more Exasperating things till finally I turn around and yell at him and then we'd argue for four more hours.

532
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,168
Speaker 0: Yep It's an awesome game.

533
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:23,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, and So he figured hey people love to listen to this shit.

534
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:24,304
Speaker 0: You know which?

535
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:30,120
Speaker 1: we actually have evidence of that because every now and then we had someone just like stay in our apartment overnight And they wouldn't go sleep on the couch.

536
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:35,020
Speaker 0: They'd sit in the bedroom and listen to us and they would laugh hysterically and then none of us could get sleep.

537
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:35,876
Speaker 0: And it was kind of you know.

538
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:41,540
Speaker 0: So we always thought we should record it, but we never did because it's kind of hard to record people laying in bed.

539
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:43,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus we didn't have microphones.

540
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:44,451
Speaker 1: We didn't have money.

541
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:46,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now we got this going on.

542
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:47,445
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty good.

543
00:39:47,747 --> 00:39:48,771
Speaker 0: Other people seem to think it's good.

544
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:49,756
Speaker 0: I mean, they're still listening.

545
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:51,962
Speaker 0: I see numbers All right.

546
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:54,469
Speaker 0: Now, where's the podcast going?

547
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,540
Speaker 1: We'd like to one have the energy we've had.

548
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,960
Speaker 1: I mean some of our podcasts are really good and some of them are kind of ad because we're tired.

549
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:09,155
Speaker 1: We want to get to a point where we do it So efficiently that we still get enough sleep and we always have that funny bantery energy.

550
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:09,757
Speaker 1: Yep.

551
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:10,560
Speaker 0: That's a good thing.

552
00:40:11,424 --> 00:40:19,039
Speaker 0: A lot of people out there who are podcasting have this kind of idea Mostly from certain podcast companies that they can you know.

553
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:23,335
Speaker 0: Eventually, they're gonna quit their day jobs and be like professional podcasters for a living.

554
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,560
Speaker 1: You know what screw that.

555
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:25,768
Speaker 1: We don't want to make money off of it.

556
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:27,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really care for that.

557
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,100
Speaker 0: I just want to like make a cool show and have a little community and you know be cool.

558
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:37,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if we were after money, there are a million things we could do to make money and we're still working on some Of those schemes.

559
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:42,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean as far as what I want to get out of the podcast is, you know Meet people.

560
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:50,859
Speaker 0: I want to you know Go to a convention and you know do a cool podcast and I want to use it as a means to do cool things That you know money can't buy.

561
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:56,586
Speaker 1: I mean, how cool would it be if we went to like Otacon and we ran into some people were like, hey You're the geek night skies.

562
00:40:56,646 --> 00:40:59,080
Speaker 1: We know you and then we hung out with those people for the weekend.

563
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:11,177
Speaker 1: Yep, or if we were like, you know the official podcast of some thing somewhere which Yeah, I got some really small venues that are all about us being like a podcast.

564
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:21,138
Speaker 0: live there Yeah, and we could just keep moving on up eventually would be like, you know The official podcast of something really big or something really cool and maybe like packs or something.

565
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:24,549
Speaker 1: Yeah We're going to packs next year.

566
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:25,233
Speaker 0: Damn it.

567
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:35,420
Speaker 0: No one's gonna stop me You know and as far as the future of our content, I figure you know, we just want to keep doing what we're doing.

568
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:43,640
Speaker 1: We'll keep making incremental changes But we'll change real quick if our listeners really want something or really don't like something or really like something

569
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:54,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if all of a sudden every one of our listeners decided that you know Our anime talk is like the best anime talk of any podcast there is and we should make an anime only podcast.

570
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:57,032
Speaker 0: I guess you know, we might be persuaded to do that.

571
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:58,137
Speaker 0: No, I don't think that's gonna happen.

572
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:08,603
Speaker 0: No, but You know, that's you know, we will go wherever You know to a point where we have a lot of listeners who are happy and We're happy.

573
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:12,280
Speaker 1: Yep, because it's easy to make us happy because I like the sound of my own voice.

574
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's because we're not trying to make money.

575
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,220
Speaker 0: So we're not just gonna do whatever we can, you know, whatever it takes to make money.

576
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:23,439
Speaker 1: Well, we just do a podcast about mesothelioma.

577
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:32,107
Speaker 1: Yeah But Yeah We'll talk about that someday.

578
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:34,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're not gonna do whatever it takes to make money.

579
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:43,477
Speaker 1: We're gonna do whatever we enjoy with while simultaneously Please we've got two sliders our enjoyment and your enjoyment and we're gonna get them both as high as we can.

580
00:42:43,497 --> 00:42:49,170
Speaker 1: Yep Without sacrificing one or the other because we really there's a lot of reason we don't want to make money.

581
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:49,591
Speaker 1: one.

582
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:54,653
Speaker 1: I Advertising.

583
00:42:54,796 --> 00:43:04,607
Speaker 1: really Well, it doesn't bother me because I don't see it But whenever advertising penetrates my little rim bubble if I don't see advertising it bothers me a lot Yep, and I hate ads.

584
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,037
Speaker 1: I block ads to the point of like.

585
00:43:07,078 --> 00:43:07,640
Speaker 1: there's ad block.

586
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,352
Speaker 1: A lot of people use ad block and it blocks ads in Firefox.

587
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:17,680
Speaker 1: I use such a blunt Slash-and-burn filter of blocking ads that you wouldn't believe it.

588
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:20,172
Speaker 0: I just use the automatic filter that other people set up.

589
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:28,380
Speaker 0: but rim if he sees Like a website that has one ad he'll block every image that ever comes from that domain.

590
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:38,036
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm net or org just the whole any any any domain that contains that Part of the URL in it just every image block never seen again.

591
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:43,937
Speaker 1: I'm real Uh, I'm real pro capitalism, but capitalism involves my right to not listen to you.

592
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:46,562
Speaker 0: Yep Capitalism's cool.

593
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:48,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, well this job will miss on Adam Smith.

594
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:49,850
Speaker 1: Capitalism is cool.

595
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:52,818
Speaker 1: The problem is America isn't really capitalist anymore.

596
00:43:52,878 --> 00:43:55,643
Speaker 1: It's kind of Something bad.

597
00:43:55,884 --> 00:44:02,645
Speaker 0: Yeah evil is not socialist because I like socialism too, but Yeah, it's broken.

598
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:06,920
Speaker 1: but anyway, we're we'll get into that, you know, well next Thursday, we don't have anything else.

599
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,905
Speaker 1: We'll talk about economics.

600
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:08,829
Speaker 0: economics is good.

601
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,246
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get a copy of the old Wealth of nations wealth of nations.

602
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:17,940
Speaker 1: read it read key passages pull out the Communist Manifesto just because I like quoting it.

603
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,343
Speaker 1: It's funny.

604
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,037
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of it's funny anyway.

605
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:31,820
Speaker 0: So the best way for all this to keep going where we want it to go Is if you email us and go to the forum.

606
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:40,920
Speaker 1: Yeah post in the forum because one if you like listening to us at all You'd probably really like hanging out with us and you probably really like our friends because they're all a lot like us.

607
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you are all unless you are socially inept in which case we don't want to hang out with you.

608
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:50,559
Speaker 1: But but keep in mind our definition of socially inept is probably far below what you'd think.

609
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:58,800
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I hung out with some like 30 year old 40 50 year old board gaming guys over the weekend and that was okay.

610
00:44:59,502 --> 00:45:02,132
Speaker 0: So it's tough to play with it this way there.

611
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:04,420
Speaker 1: There are probably there are less than five people.

612
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:13,639
Speaker 1: We've known that we actually don't like Yeah, like the number is so small that I think we could spend a Thursday on each one of them telling you all about them Because it's funny.

613
00:45:14,664 --> 00:45:15,979
Speaker 1: They're all really funny stories.

614
00:45:16,682 --> 00:45:21,280
Speaker 0: Well, it's really funny when someone is such a loser or such a terrible person.

615
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we don't give someone shy that doesn't bother us.

616
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:32,151
Speaker 1: We're talking about people who are socially inept in the abrasive talking about horrible Pornography all the time because they somehow think that you want to hear about that.

617
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,397
Speaker 0: God God that guy.

618
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:39,857
Speaker 1: All right Fuck What you gotta have the fuck.

619
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:42,348
Speaker 1: we see we think of a lot of silly ideas.

620
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:50,369
Speaker 1: one day We thought we were gonna put a number at the end of every Post for a podcast and we wouldn't say what that number is and it would just be the number of times We swore during the podcast.

621
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:54,863
Speaker 0: It's like the math teacher who put a tally on the board every time.

622
00:45:54,863 --> 00:46:01,665
Speaker 1: 69 was the answer to a math problem Or the game we played with our Cal teacher in high school because he said, uh-huh.

623
00:46:02,086 --> 00:46:02,368
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

624
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:07,858
Speaker 1: Okay Constantly and If actually if no one answered him, you just keep doing it.

625
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,043
Speaker 1: It was kind of scary.

626
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:10,750
Speaker 0: All right, I think we're getting off track.

627
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're getting off track way off track.

628
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:13,099
Speaker 1: That's fine.

629
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,175
Speaker 0: But you know, this is the kind of stuff that we do here and That's what you can expect more of.

630
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:22,410
Speaker 1: yeah, and if you don't like it yell at us or don't listen to us.

631
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:25,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know we don't change to what you like because no one's making you listen.

632
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,562
Speaker 0: Whoo, whoo Whoo geek nights.

633
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:33,825
Speaker 1: Yeah So now we're just gonna trail off.

634
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,118
Speaker 1: Keep saying a few words and then at some point I'll paste the music in after the fact.

635
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:44,409
Speaker 1: All right Though I got I just had a couple of good ideas actually for what to do on Thursdays.

636
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,076
Speaker 1: Yeah whole bunch of ideas.

637
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:52,063
Speaker 1: we could have opinion Thursdays where we pick a topic We state our opinion on it and then we defend that opinion.

638
00:46:52,123 --> 00:47:06,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it has to be Where we don't have the same opinion Yeah, or even if we have the same opinion we broadcast our opinion to the world like if we did one on economics things We're really opinionated on more things We disagree on.

639
00:47:06,634 --> 00:47:09,584
Speaker 1: if we disagree will argue and our arguments often end funnily.

640
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:14,570
Speaker 1: if we agree strongly Well, he will talk about it forever because we just keep it's like a feedback loop.

641
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:23,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as you know, you don't just dip down to the same baseline Philosophical argument every single time.

642
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:25,570
Speaker 0: Yeah what the topic is pornography up?

643
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,067
Speaker 0: No, we got to talk about this flat philosophical argument.

644
00:47:28,088 --> 00:47:41,070
Speaker 1: Well, we have And the only thing I've ever experienced in this world is my own Okay, whatever talking about computers the same philosophical argument every time, you know, we have this problem when we argue.

645
00:47:41,675 --> 00:47:47,690
Speaker 1: Sometimes we argue to come to a truth Like we're arguing about what the best blah is and then we come to an answer and we both agree.

646
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:53,510
Speaker 1: But a lot of times we start arguing and we're not arguing to convince the other person.

647
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,530
Speaker 1: We're not arguing to find the answer to something.

648
00:47:56,031 --> 00:47:58,699
Speaker 1: We're just arguing for the sake of arguing to beat each other.

649
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,269
Speaker 1: and then we both pull some stupid dirty argumentation tricks.

650
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:09,867
Speaker 1: Add hominem attacks left and right and hominem We really like.

651
00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:18,270
Speaker 1: When someone makes a logical fallacy We like naming it in Latin and then yelling at each other then arguing over what it actually means and whether or not it was.

652
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:42,678
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah I think I'm gonna go in my room and do some stuff and they go to bed I'm gonna play some Mario Kart and get some sleep and Yeah, we're going to Albany tomorrow.

653
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:48,082
Speaker 0: We're gonna play some better And some lighter boy terror and see which one's better.

654
00:48:48,102 --> 00:48:55,231
Speaker 1: oh and some Tigers and Euphrates duh Alright.

655
00:48:55,633 --> 00:49:00,190
Speaker 0: so it's yeah Leroy Jenkins Leroy, you can cut a whole bunch of the end off.

656
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,307
Speaker 1: I think I just leave it on cuz it's a little long, isn't it?

657
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:06,480
Speaker 1: No, our part of this podcast is not our longest podcast.

658
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:08,769
Speaker 1: We only talked 23 minutes just now.

659
00:49:09,452 --> 00:49:09,773
Speaker 0: All right.

660
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,945
Speaker 0: How long do we talk for the beginning news parties about 20 minutes?

661
00:49:13,307 --> 00:49:13,608
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

662
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:16,184
Speaker 0: Yeah Are fucking fine.

663
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:16,609
Speaker 1: Yeah

664
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:22,376
Speaker 0: Hey, I wonder Alright, well then keep this on hold on

665
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:37,126
Speaker 1: see cuz I one thing I've noticed is on a podcast that it Matt You can't ramble early on because then people lose interest but you can ramble at the end because if someone stops listening now Now it doesn't matter because you're not missing anything important.

666
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:37,970
Speaker 1: You're just missing us going.

667
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:40,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I wonder if they'll listen again.

668
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:43,750
Speaker 0: I mean the real listeners listen to the whole thing intently.

669
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,054
Speaker 0: You know, that's that's the goal.

670
00:49:45,134 --> 00:49:46,739
Speaker 0: is you you you don't.

671
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:52,781
Speaker 0: I don't want to be like a super professional radio guy and do everything The radio way because that's against the point of podcasting.

672
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,288
Speaker 1: We don't want to be so amateur.

673
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:54,690
Speaker 1: it hurts.

674
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,196
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't want to be so amateur that it hurts the listeners.

675
00:49:57,718 --> 00:50:09,533
Speaker 0: and I do want to like do things that aren't obviously Professional, you know where it doesn't feel professional, but it you know, you do things to keep people Like going.

676
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:22,990
Speaker 0: good like you can give a speech in such a way where you have a conversational tone but you still apply the right speech techniques the people pay attention and Are more inclined to agree with what you're saying because you say them in you know, the right way.

677
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:35,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know and that's what I kind of want to do is I want to do the podcast in a way where people are interested paying attention Caring going to listen again, but I don't want it to feel professional sound professional.

678
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:36,209
Speaker 0: I want it to sound.

679
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:40,290
Speaker 1: You know, we want to sound like a car is a way to feel like you're just sitting here with us.

680
00:50:40,478 --> 00:50:43,581
Speaker 1: Yeah which actually one of our friends said something to that effect.

681
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:57,889
Speaker 1: because but we had a one show a while ago where we argued about Something and a friend of ours, you know who you are Actually told me that he a couple of times He actually started to argue with us a little bit and then stopped himself when he realized that we couldn't hear him.

682
00:50:58,535 --> 00:50:59,464
Speaker 0: That is excellent.

683
00:50:59,565 --> 00:51:07,310
Speaker 1: Yeah See our biggest problem is whenever we're tired We tend to talk at you and whenever we're not tired, we have more of a conversation with each other.

684
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,267
Speaker 1: That's informative or entertaining to you.

685
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,558
Speaker 1: The moral is we got to not be tired.

686
00:51:11,759 --> 00:51:13,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you?

687
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:14,310
Speaker 0: it also depends, you know?

688
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:18,868
Speaker 0: It's another thing we want feedback on is should we talk to the listener like I am right now.

689
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:23,428
Speaker 1: Hello listener Hello, or should we talk like hey Scott guess what?

690
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:28,945
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh by the I. I guess people who don't know us don't realize that I'm Scott and I'm rim.

691
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, we maybe we should do that.

692
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:32,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't do that.

693
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,843
Speaker 0: maybe yeah, I didn't even realize that until just now.
