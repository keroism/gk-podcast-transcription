1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,547
Speaker 0: It's Thursday August 2nd.

2
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:12,551
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,940
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nides.

4
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:18,938
Speaker 0: Tonight we review the concept of reviews.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,396
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:34,577
Speaker 0: Man, I was more productive today than I've been in like I don't know at least a year Yesterday at work.

7
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,370
Speaker 1: There was absolutely no work today at work.

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,750
Speaker 1: There was like five minutes of work, so I asked my other workers if I could have some work.

9
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:46,609
Speaker 1: They gave me two works that took 15 minutes each.

10
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:48,488
Speaker 0: You should have just gone home.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,903
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what I did after I finished the second 15 minute work.

12
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:54,650
Speaker 0: See I'm not talking about work at work.

13
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:56,102
Speaker 0: I didn't do a lot at work today.

14
00:00:56,143 --> 00:01:04,188
Speaker 0: what I did is I did more geek night stuff than I've done in a long time and I got all my ducks in a row and they're swimming In the water and everything's great.

15
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:05,471
Speaker 1: That's good.

16
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:07,539
Speaker 0: I sent out so many emails.

17
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,847
Speaker 0: that sounds like something lame, but I actually did.

18
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:13,139
Speaker 0: it was kind of important Alrighty send in the email.

19
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,210
Speaker 0: Yes, and I got like four more to send tonight.

20
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:18,690
Speaker 1: I actually started doing stuff because there was nothing to do.

21
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,969
Speaker 1: I tried to work on our new website, and I made a tiny bit of progress.

22
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:24,370
Speaker 1: mostly.

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:43,190
Speaker 1: I just sat around looking at actually well-designed websites and I realized something is that you see all these really fancy well-designed websites right and other than web 2.0 stuff like dig who hires fancy designers to make their sites and the sites of the fancy designers.

24
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:48,530
Speaker 1: There are hardly any sites that are fancy and well-designed like that.

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:02:00,059
Speaker 1: I mean you go to these sites that have galleries of you know screenshots of well-designed websites and links to those well-designed websites so that you can get Inspiration from looking at all these fancy sites.

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,287
Speaker 1: I said fancy sites like a thousand times.

27
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:03,210
Speaker 0: suffice to say

28
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:19,050
Speaker 1: Yes You look at all these fancy sites for inspiration for your own site in hopes to make it just as fancy and you realize that every single fancy site you're looking at is a site of a web designer or a Site one of the five sites made by one of those web designers.

29
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,690
Speaker 1: That's not actually a major website that anyone actually visits or uses.

30
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:34,650
Speaker 0: I think the real problem is that we came up with a couple of site designs that if we actually Implemented them somehow would be amazing like they'd actually be amazing and I think they'd be great for geek notch.

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:42,489
Speaker 0: The problem is the amount of time and effort it would take to actually set that up Without because WordPress wouldn't do it by itself mostly.

32
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:46,370
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing is that part I can handle easily.

33
00:02:46,490 --> 00:03:01,501
Speaker 1: it's the Photoshop part that I can't handle and you know, I ask people to help out and The people who are willing they suck and the people who are don't suck are Unwilling or lazy or they'll charge me money or whatever.

34
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:08,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, damn them trying to make a living off of what they do I know but the thing is they charge like I'm willing to pay someone.

35
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:17,410
Speaker 1: the problem is is that the market price is like Thousands of dollars which while I agree is a fair price if they're gonna make me a site that's that awesome.

36
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,482
Speaker 1: But I'm just not willing to pay that kind of money.

37
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:24,118
Speaker 1: I don't I. if I had that money I'd spend it on something else instead.

38
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,525
Speaker 1: So I don't know.

39
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,614
Speaker 1: I Guess we're just gonna have to.

40
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,241
Speaker 1: maybe I'll take the Craigslist route.

41
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,250
Speaker 1: poor poor design.

42
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,495
Speaker 0: We want to do now, are you sure?

43
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:32,717
Speaker 0: oh really?

44
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,750
Speaker 0: I just want to make our site some sort of two column instead of three column.

45
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:40,648
Speaker 1: I think I can succeed at doing that.

46
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:52,041
Speaker 0: basically We just want to make it less cluttered and kind of collapse a lot of the extraneous fluff like the archive million links into like One archives page and I think I can definitely succeed at doing that.

47
00:03:52,302 --> 00:04:00,618
Speaker 0: the big thing because actually whenever we get a bunch of new Listeners, it seems like the biggest problem is that most people don't to this day Know what a podcast is or how to subscribe.

48
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,220
Speaker 0: and I'd still say that a good 40% of our listeners Go to the website and download mp3s manually.

49
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:06,782
Speaker 1: Yep.

50
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:08,227
Speaker 1: I'm definitely gonna.

51
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:08,910
Speaker 1: I got that.

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,470
Speaker 1: I have that in mind in my design for the new site.

53
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:20,728
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make it pretty obvious that this is a show of audio content that is made four days a week And if you want to subscribe you can do so.

54
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:25,042
Speaker 1: Anyway suffice to say god damn it stuff doing that.

55
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:26,246
Speaker 0: see now I'm doing it on purpose.

56
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:27,590
Speaker 1: No, don't do that.

57
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,218
Speaker 1: It's not funny on purpose or by accident.

58
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,421
Speaker 0: I think it's quite funny.

59
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,266
Speaker 1: No, it's not like it's annoying.

60
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:34,229
Speaker 0: No, I like it.

61
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:41,697
Speaker 1: No, well anyway suffice to say in some your mother in total your mother I'll come up with annoying thing to say.

62
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,202
Speaker 0: and what are you gonna say?

63
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,345
Speaker 0: What could you possibly say?

64
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:44,947
Speaker 0: That's annoying.

65
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:45,810
Speaker 1: suffice to say.

66
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:56,298
Speaker 0: Anyway, I forgot what I was gonna say, but We're expect a few changes to the website in the coming month or two.

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,654
Speaker 0: Expect t-shirts and swag and all that business in the coming month or two the con seasons over.

68
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:02,818
Speaker 0: until what December.

69
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,009
Speaker 1: Yep No more time.

70
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,580
Speaker 0: So we actually have time to work on stuff.

71
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:11,280
Speaker 0: Of course, a lot of those projects were working on actually have nothing to do with geek nights at least not directly.

72
00:05:11,662 --> 00:05:13,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

73
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,220
Speaker 1: That is just fine.

74
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,432
Speaker 0: so in the news this was all over dig and a lot of people were outraged about it.

75
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:25,720
Speaker 0: and while it is a Somewhat common thing in Mexico it bothers me and it bothers me at a bunch of levels.

76
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:28,520
Speaker 0: Some of these levels have almost nothing to do with this situation.

77
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:35,600
Speaker 0: The basic story is that Walmart is employing people in Mexico in their store about teenagers.

78
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:36,462
Speaker 0: Yeah people.

79
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,448
Speaker 0: Well, what are you implying there?

80
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:42,460
Speaker 1: Well, it's you know, they're only doing it to teenagers not doing it to anyone else.

81
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,547
Speaker 0: Well, are they doing it to teenagers directly?

82
00:05:44,688 --> 00:05:47,880
Speaker 0: or is it simply that teenagers are the only people who do this sort of thing?

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,022
Speaker 1: I don't know.

84
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:53,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know that information is not given but it is reported as teenagers.

85
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,724
Speaker 1: That's what the report says.

86
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:59,159
Speaker 0: However, you definitely did give the the impression that somehow teenagers are not people.

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,280
Speaker 0: now.

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,974
Speaker 0: Well, this is really that wall.

89
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:01,559
Speaker 0: This is true.

90
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:09,107
Speaker 0: Anyway suffice to say Okay, I'm done with that I'm gonna get up and hit you.

91
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,737
Speaker 0: they're not paying these people any money.

92
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:23,171
Speaker 0: And in fact instead of paying them and they're all baggers and stuff They have a big sign that says quote our volunteer Packers collect No salary only the gratuity that you give them.

93
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:24,154
Speaker 0: super Rama.

94
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,779
Speaker 0: Thanks you for your understanding.

95
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,479
Speaker 0: now Here's how I read this sign translated into logic speak.

96
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:35,860
Speaker 0: We have effectively beggars that are under our employ that we do not pay.

97
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,900
Speaker 0: We are trying to guilt you into paying them for us so that we do not have to bother paying baggers.

98
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:42,075
Speaker 0: Thank you for your money.

99
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:48,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I like how you said baggers where it could also be construed as beggars.

100
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:51,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see I could have made some sort of like.

101
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:56,644
Speaker 0: I could put a schwa there or basically all you dip thongs and made a little literary joke.

102
00:06:56,684 --> 00:07:08,240
Speaker 1: basically you have these teenagers who are willing to do menial labor for money and Walmart is offering them not money, but they're offering them basically free marketing.

103
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:19,243
Speaker 1: They're basically marketing to the customers that they should somehow pay these people and they're paying these beggars Essentially these working beggars with marketing.

104
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:26,875
Speaker 0: this is only one step above that scuzzy guy with the bottle of water and the Nasty rag it tries to wash my window in the Bronx.

105
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:34,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is This is like if that guy Had a gigolo or a pimp and that guy had like 20 of these guys.

106
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,678
Speaker 0: He directed them all and then I don't know took all the money.

107
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:42,520
Speaker 0: Not even took all the money just directed him off for no good reason and somehow made money off of it.

108
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:54,993
Speaker 1: The metaphor breaks down but you get the idea The thing the only problem the only thing I can say in Walmart's favor because this is horrendous and bad in every conceivable Fashion is that no one's forcing these people to work there.

109
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,400
Speaker 1: So there they are doing it on their own.

110
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:01,739
Speaker 1: It's not like there's slaves or anything But at the same time as far as I know they could.

111
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,726
Speaker 1: If they are that's even worse.

112
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:09,341
Speaker 0: Walmart is very obviously exploiting these people in a very direct manner Definitely.

113
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:14,215
Speaker 0: now the wider issue that bothers me a lot is the idea of tipping.

114
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:24,460
Speaker 0: the fact that in America I know we have a lot of foreign listeners, but in America you pretty much have to tip They don't pay waiters or busboys or anything practically any money in this country.

115
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,030
Speaker 1: Yes If you're someone who serves tables at a restaurant you do.

116
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:35,039
Speaker 1: you get paid usually like less than minimum wage Because you're not considered like, you know an hourly worker.

117
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:47,300
Speaker 1: And that's the way the crazy law is is a lot of those people get paid less than people at McDonald's and they're doing a More important job that requires more skills and and it's harder and it takes more hours.

118
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:57,419
Speaker 0: So in return the way they make money is that pretty much any time you eat anywhere in this country you have to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip or else you basically screw this person.

119
00:08:57,439 --> 00:09:03,057
Speaker 0: and The fact that tipping is effectively mandatory in the US has bothered me for my entire life.

120
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,326
Speaker 0: It bothers me Means hey good lad.

121
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,389
Speaker 0: You did a fine job.

122
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:08,392
Speaker 0: Here's a shiny quarter.

123
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:09,255
Speaker 0: go about your day.

124
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:17,059
Speaker 0: Yep, and We had a plan that we haven't gone through with but we've talked about a lot and the plan was kind of self-centered Nassau.

125
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:30,534
Speaker 0: Basically, the idea was to not ever tip unless it was an establishment that we plan to return to in the future Where it is likely that they will remember us Mm-hmm, and basically just be bandits when it comes to tipping because I get nothing out of tipping.

126
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:40,809
Speaker 0: and the worst thing is the idea Is oh, well, if you have tipping like that Then you can punish a waitress who's bad and therefore waitresses will be good But I can't punish the cook if the food's crappy.

127
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,156
Speaker 0: I can't punish the restaurant if it's dirty.

128
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:44,340
Speaker 0: I can only punish the waitress.

129
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:51,864
Speaker 1: yep, and sometimes the waitress will be really nice or the waiter will be really cool and Something else sucked.

130
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:54,813
Speaker 1: and I have no way to express that suckage.

131
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,799
Speaker 1: Is there's nothing I can do about it?

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:15,198
Speaker 1: and Still I'm sort of still obligated in some way to pay extra money above and beyond what I am legally required to pay For no reason because bill basically because someone is getting paid less than minimum wage and I have to subsidize them or else I'm an asshole.

133
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:19,679
Speaker 0: Granted I have stiff people on tips a lot of times in the past, but they always deserved it.

134
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:27,971
Speaker 1: Yes, all I'm saying is that everyone should be paid minimum wage and you should only be Obligated or semi socially obligated.

135
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,640
Speaker 1: You should never be legally obligated to tip anyone ever.

136
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:40,000
Speaker 1: You should only be well, you're not in this country It's okay, but you should only be socially obligated to tip someone if they did something above and beyond the call of duty.

137
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,469
Speaker 1: Otherwise, they shouldn't expect a tip ever.

138
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:46,927
Speaker 1: a tip should be like a surprise like oh man's a surprise a tip Holy crap granted.

139
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:56,994
Speaker 0: by the same token back at RIT We actually were known at all the local restaurants for being extravagant tippers Which was kind of weird when I think about it because that was the poorest I ever was.

140
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:58,780
Speaker 0: and yet somehow we tipped a lot.

141
00:10:58,861 --> 00:10:59,993
Speaker 0: But it worked out.

142
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:00,559
Speaker 0: we tip so much.

143
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:14,368
Speaker 1: I think the reason was is that a lot of people cuz you're so poor Right would eat something very cheap and you had a big table with a lot of people all eating things that were relatively cheap but everyone tipped at least one dollar.

144
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:25,803
Speaker 1: so you would get a situation where it would be like a $70 meal that for everyone total with like a $20 tip because there are 20 people there and that was crazy I think.

145
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:33,240
Speaker 0: the other thing was we used to hang out with our way the local gaming club and We just you know They kind of split up the bill and we always ended up throwing in X amount of dollars.

146
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:37,440
Speaker 0: At one time we went out to eat without all those assholes and we learned something.

147
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,049
Speaker 0: The bills were far lower than we thought.

148
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:50,780
Speaker 0: half those people were just asses who stiffed everyone on the check And we ended up leaving like a 200% tip that one time Just by throwing in what we normally threw in and then we stopped hanging out with those people.

149
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,589
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much but yeah tipping sucks.

150
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,859
Speaker 1: the Walmart should fucking pay the employees in Mexico.

151
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:00,593
Speaker 0: luckily It looks like the Mexican government is all about fixing this loophole.

152
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:01,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's good.

153
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,488
Speaker 1: And Yeah, that's all I got to say about that.

154
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,840
Speaker 1: Okay rim one of the things you hate the most you ready?

155
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,301
Speaker 0: All right.

156
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,766
Speaker 0: So is it some pyramid nut job?

157
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,993
Speaker 0: No, is it some Randy homeopathy?

158
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,220
Speaker 0: No, is it something about education?

159
00:12:14,361 --> 00:12:18,740
Speaker 0: Yep, I knew it was one of the three who knew what it was cuz I semi told you before the show.

160
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was trying to keep that secret.

161
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,115
Speaker 0: I could give the illusion that we'd.

162
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,761
Speaker 0: oh, well, yes There's.

163
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:29,540
Speaker 1: basically I'm gonna try to sum up this story the best I can because it's a two-pager in the New York Times ready.

164
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,179
Speaker 1: There's a teacher in a Manhattan school.

165
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:35,940
Speaker 1: He had a student who sucked right?

166
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,798
Speaker 1: he failed the student because the student failed and didn't show up for their final as he should have.

167
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:48,035
Speaker 1: the Administration Sort of forced him to pass the student because there's.

168
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:49,120
Speaker 1: it's sort of complicated.

169
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:57,133
Speaker 1: There was a note that excused them like a doctor's note but the administration misread the note and the note said that.

170
00:12:57,253 --> 00:13:01,758
Speaker 1: the note actually said they were only excused for some days and not the days they actually missed.

171
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:07,172
Speaker 1: and Basically, the student missed dozens of classes failed to turn in numerous homework assignments.

172
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,440
Speaker 1: the teacher kept meticulous records.

173
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:16,513
Speaker 1: Other teachers corroborated what this teacher said and The student should have failed.

174
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:17,280
Speaker 1: they failed.

175
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:28,618
Speaker 1: They took the final and still failed the final when they got to retake it after getting extra tutoring from another math teacher which was not offered to any of the other students.

176
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:33,945
Speaker 1: and in the end they Administration still passed the student.

177
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:36,412
Speaker 0: Ah, I'm I'm seething here.

178
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,875
Speaker 1: Wait, wait and get it ready.

179
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:38,497
Speaker 1: Here's your ready.

180
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:39,600
Speaker 1: You want to go nuts?

181
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:44,620
Speaker 0: I don't want to go nuts cuz I I already had you want to be angrier than you've been angry all day.

182
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:51,179
Speaker 0: I'm gonna warn everyone right now that I now already have about an hour's worth of yelling from this story that I'm gonna hold in.

183
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,552
Speaker 1: Are you ready to hold in a thousand times the yelling?

184
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,460
Speaker 0: I hope the compressors strong enough.

185
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,519
Speaker 1: This is the final line or the final paragraph of this article ready.

186
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:02,703
Speaker 1: Mr.

187
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,029
Speaker 1: Lamp rose who's the teacher?

188
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:20,619
Speaker 1: recalled one comment that mrs Fernandez the student's mother made during their meeting about why it was important for Indira The student to graduate she couldn't afford to pay for her to attend another senior prom in another senior year.

189
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,672
Speaker 0: Hate this country and everyone in it.

190
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:35,140
Speaker 0: that that symbolizes that exact Everything that happened there symbolizes everything that's wrong with America because it all comes down to education.

191
00:14:35,562 --> 00:14:38,799
Speaker 0: in fact, I think almost every problem in the world comes down to poor education and

192
00:14:41,502 --> 00:15:02,833
Speaker 1: I think this might sound extreme but I am going to say that in the If I were if I was in the position of the Congress of the United States And I was a judge interpreting the law that I just made and I was the police The mom would be arrested for neglect of her child.

193
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:04,037
Speaker 1: That's what I say.

194
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:04,779
Speaker 1: That's how it should be.

195
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:06,388
Speaker 1: That's how it should be.

196
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:07,414
Speaker 1: That's neglect.

197
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:13,620
Speaker 1: right there You have a kid who's doing poorly in school and you say take my kid out of school.

198
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,949
Speaker 1: They don't need any more learning even though they're dumb as a brick.

199
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,560
Speaker 0: I think the problem though is far deeper.

200
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:24,580
Speaker 1: You should probably have your kid taken away from you if you're that bad Though I think the problem is far deeper than it is far deeper.

201
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,550
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna get all John Taylor got to because I like him.

202
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:41,010
Speaker 0: He's a little nutty but I agree with about 60% of what he has to say, but I'm of the mind that the US educational system could be reformed Really simply to become extremely awesome.

203
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,554
Speaker 0: Yeah in the span of like four years.

204
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:42,795
Speaker 0: Yeah,

205
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:43,156
Speaker 1: basically

206
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:44,500
Speaker 0: doing a show on that remind me

207
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:53,097
Speaker 1: Yes but basically all I got to say is that while I think the best solution would be to redo the whole school system with some crazy new education

208
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:53,879
Speaker 0: not even that it

209
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,768
Speaker 1: could be a Very you're not letting me finish Is that I think that would be?

210
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:02,405
Speaker 1: the best solution would be if we did some crazy Revolution of the education system.

211
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,370
Speaker 0: We could just do a reverse pull pot.

212
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:15,060
Speaker 1: We could but reverse pull pot solves everything even if we just Regardless of that while slight modifications such as actually failing people, right?

213
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,025
Speaker 1: Wouldn't be the perfect?

214
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,180
Speaker 1: be all end all solution to having an awesome education system.

215
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:28,146
Speaker 1: They would improve things so much with such a with just a few small changes that you wouldn't be complaining.

216
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:36,171
Speaker 1: you wouldn't be thinking about having a big revolution because if we just started failing people and Actually having hard classes and being hard on students.

217
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:38,540
Speaker 1: I think the real is just pushing the honors people forward.

218
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:48,200
Speaker 1: That's all you have to do and if you do that Well the education quality will improve like a thousand percent and you won't even think about having a revolution because it'll be so great.

219
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,183
Speaker 1: It won't be perfect.

220
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:56,403
Speaker 1: Like it could be if you had a John Taylor Gatto style ish revolution of education, but it'll be great It'll be awesome.

221
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:57,487
Speaker 0: So think about that.

222
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:00,920
Speaker 0: All Scott basically said was reward students who do well.

223
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:04,039
Speaker 0: Have consequences for students who don't do well.

224
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,223
Speaker 1: Don't just pass.

225
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,431
Speaker 0: everybody have a press stupid reasons.

226
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,960
Speaker 0: have a path of improvement for students who don't do well.

227
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:13,837
Speaker 0: Those three things alone would revolutionize education in the US.

228
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:16,022
Speaker 1: Yep, and Here is here.

229
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,271
Speaker 1: This is New York Times people.

230
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:22,859
Speaker 1: It is a circumstantial evidence But this goes on all the time.

231
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:29,040
Speaker 1: In fact, this was there was the school policy is what makes this circumstance happen.

232
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,265
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna relate.

233
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:33,720
Speaker 1: policy of the school itself is not circumstantial evidence.

234
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:38,340
Speaker 1: This is just the kind of circumstances that arise from the shitty school policy.

235
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:49,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna relate to you a short anecdote but in Michigan where I went to high school there were these tests these standardized tests that everyone in the state had to take when you were a junior and Basically you had to pass these tests with a minimal passing grade.

236
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:52,290
Speaker 0: You didn't have to do really well on these tests.

237
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,780
Speaker 0: You barely had to get anywhere the easy test.

238
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,544
Speaker 0: well, here's the thing.

239
00:17:55,825 --> 00:18:01,245
Speaker 0: if you didn't pass these tests you didn't get a certified diploma and Essentially they tested.

240
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:05,620
Speaker 0: can you read at like a middle school level at the end of high school?

241
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,729
Speaker 0: Can you do basic arithmetic?

242
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:08,975
Speaker 0: and that was it?

243
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:09,840
Speaker 0: That was all attested?

244
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,040
Speaker 1: Yeah in Connecticut actually there was a lot of standardized testing throughout my school years.

245
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:19,700
Speaker 1: But one test they added when I was in high school was the cap test the Connecticut aptitude something.

246
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had the right the Michigan something something so whatever.

247
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:23,562
Speaker 1: that was the new test They added.

248
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:33,454
Speaker 1: and the deal with that test was that it didn't determine whether you would graduate or not Basically it if you did well on it, they added a stamp to your diploma.

249
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:34,177
Speaker 0: That's what ours was.

250
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,260
Speaker 0: You got a certified diploma.

251
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,284
Speaker 1: It wasn't certified.

252
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:37,668
Speaker 1: It just had an extra stamp.

253
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:38,672
Speaker 0: That's all this early.

254
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:39,756
Speaker 0: That's all the certification.

255
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,214
Speaker 1: while they didn't say certified They said stamp that you got a stamp.

256
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:47,625
Speaker 1: Okay, and these tests actually Were quite difficult.

257
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:54,239
Speaker 1: like one of them you had to design and execute a science experiment and you know Take your lab results and draw conclusions from it.

258
00:18:54,621 --> 00:19:03,680
Speaker 1: And another one actually had like a couple calculus questions on it and it was actually hard tests Except for the writing one, which is the same as every other writing test.

259
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,468
Speaker 1: It was read a bunch of stuff.

260
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:06,533
Speaker 1: then write an opinion.

261
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,140
Speaker 0: I don't remember the writing paragraph.

262
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:10,519
Speaker 0: Remember the writing test to get into RIT?

263
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:16,074
Speaker 0: No, every every freshman at RIT had to take this writing test to see if you got into.

264
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:17,237
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah

265
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:17,839
Speaker 1: in the little

266
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:25,500
Speaker 0: blue book Yeah, I took the test was basically like right about your summer vacation in 20 words or less

267
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:26,785
Speaker 1: pretty much and

268
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:27,489
Speaker 0: the fact that

269
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,539
Speaker 1: I filled up like one and a half blue books

270
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,336
Speaker 0: a Significant number of the people who took that test failed it.

271
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,062
Speaker 1: Wow Staggered.

272
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:38,220
Speaker 1: yeah, those people I mean think about it those people they were already accepted to RIT.

273
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,545
Speaker 1: They failed the writing test After they were already in.

274
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:45,277
Speaker 0: now the writing test tested like writing at a fifth grade level and I'm not kidding.

275
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,060
Speaker 1: and they put them.

276
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:48,311
Speaker 1: They didn't kick them out of RIT.

277
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:52,173
Speaker 1: They put them in the remedial Like liberal arts class.

278
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:53,260
Speaker 1: what the fuck?

279
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,600
Speaker 1: Why does a college a post high school place have a remedial liberal arts class that you know?

280
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:04,797
Speaker 1: Class that like Ninth graders you can't read should go You know.

281
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,366
Speaker 0: it's even more fun the fact that even if you pass with flying colors and you got to skip the crap class and go into Like the most advanced required English class.

282
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:17,120
Speaker 0: It was basically eighth grade literature and that was it.

283
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:22,000
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean we read stories that I read in middle school and wrote essays that I wrote in middle school.

284
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,206
Speaker 1: That's mine was in middle school.

285
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,570
Speaker 1: The one I took at RIT.

286
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,699
Speaker 1: My first liberal arts class was basically ninth grade English.

287
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,440
Speaker 1: again It wasn't eighth grade English.

288
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:36,920
Speaker 0: I forget if I took part one or part two But I only took one of them and it was I think I don't remember because they were sort of combined.

289
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,380
Speaker 0: It was like oh, yeah, they were but I had a bunch of AP stuff.

290
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,131
Speaker 1: So I remember everyone else read that stupid tree red star.

291
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:46,340
Speaker 1: Yes tree red stars, and then I read it sort of after everyone else.

292
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:54,332
Speaker 0: I don't remember why actually I'm gonna when I had basically had to read this God-awful book called the tree red stars for the class and this is college.

293
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:55,456
Speaker 1: pretty much everyone read it.

294
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,626
Speaker 0: I didn't read the book I didn't even buy it.

295
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:01,704
Speaker 0: I got an A. so I Looked online.

296
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,232
Speaker 0: I read a Wikipedia about.

297
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:04,580
Speaker 1: I have pushed that out of my mind.

298
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:16,500
Speaker 0: All I remember is we all read a book red star something I remember when the author of the book came to give a talk at RIT After the teachers had basically given us all this bullshit about the metaphorical meanings and the hidden symbolism and all that crap.

299
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:23,007
Speaker 0: And she basically said I wrote this book because I liked it and there's no hidden meaning in it And I didn't really intend anything by it.

300
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:27,287
Speaker 0: and I'm surprised that you guys are making so much out of it And it's kind of frightening to me.

301
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:27,709
Speaker 0: Goodbye.

302
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:30,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't actually go see that person.

303
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,915
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, I had to to get extra credit to make up for the fact that I didn't do like 90% of the work for the guys.

304
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,135
Speaker 0: I never showed up ever and I always made up an excuse too.

305
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:41,100
Speaker 0: It's not like I just skipped.

306
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:44,674
Speaker 0: I actually made up an excuse every time she bought it.

307
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:45,678
Speaker 0: every time it was great.

308
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,499
Speaker 0: Yep I was like I hurt myself in fencing class.

309
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:53,866
Speaker 0: I had to go to the doctor because I thought time I hurt myself in fencing class 9/11 happened.

310
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,525
Speaker 0: I'm distraught over 9/11.

311
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:57,846
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:58,288
Speaker 1: All right.

313
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,973
Speaker 1: Well, that's that.

314
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:01,076
Speaker 1: read this article.

315
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:04,505
Speaker 1: if you want to be pissed off Remind me.

316
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:07,239
Speaker 0: we'll do a show about this at some point.

317
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:15,370
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

318
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,260
Speaker 0: I haven't seen the Simpsons movie yet.

319
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,000
Speaker 0: I heard it's kind of funny but not as good as the actual good Simpsons.

320
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:25,840
Speaker 0: But here's a compilation of all the prank calls that Bart made to Moe.

321
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:31,360
Speaker 0: Moses lag in like the first seven seasons of the Simpsons and I forgot how hilarious those were.

322
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:43,207
Speaker 1: I think the reason that the Moe phone calls are so funny right is because number one it's an actual funny bit like Hugh jazz or Amanda hug and kiss IP freely.

323
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:46,900
Speaker 1: Ivana tinkle something like no problem be a problem, right?

324
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,384
Speaker 1: And those are John's trap.

325
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:49,508
Speaker 1: So you've got that joke.

326
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:57,540
Speaker 1: then you've got most response like, you know I'm gonna take your eyes put them in your pants So you can watch when I kick the shit out of you or something like that.

327
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,907
Speaker 0: I somehow don't think most said the word shit.

328
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,672
Speaker 1: Whatever kick the crap out of you.

329
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,598
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's fun.

330
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:08,443
Speaker 1: That's funny right, so you got two jokes, right and Lastly not.

331
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:09,988
Speaker 1: it's not just a prank call.

332
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:15,387
Speaker 1: like someone calls someone and you have one person is going ha ha ha ha ha And another person is going girl.

333
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:17,054
Speaker 1: I got praying called right?

334
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:19,844
Speaker 1: It's Someone calls someone.

335
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,047
Speaker 1: they get enjoyment.

336
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:23,314
Speaker 1: Usually Bart is standing with someone.

337
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,818
Speaker 1: he doesn't make the prank calls alone.

338
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,320
Speaker 1: very much.

339
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,553
Speaker 1: So the people around Bart also laugh and everyone in Moe's tavern also laughs.

340
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,340
Speaker 1: so it's not like one person torturing someone.

341
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:36,517
Speaker 1: It's like a whole bunch of people are all having a good time.

342
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:36,798
Speaker 1: Like hey

343
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:47,130
Speaker 0: I think that's one thing that South Park does really well, too And I think it might be why I like South Park so much is a lot of times when someone gets there come up in So something bad happens to someone who deserved it in South Park.

344
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:52,095
Speaker 0: It's not just oh they got their come up ins It's always like oh they got their come up ins.

345
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:57,075
Speaker 0: and you don't care You care about the fact that like everyone in town is watching them get their come up ins.

346
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:06,616
Speaker 1: Yep, and When I guess it's funnier when you see a whole bunch of Pete That's probably some psychological thing when you actually a bowl bunch of people enjoying something.

347
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:18,131
Speaker 0: Remember that article I talked about a while ago about how Laughter has almost no link to humor and the majority of the laugh response in mammals Humans particularly but monkeys.

348
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:29,708
Speaker 0: I have a similar thing Has to do with the power dynamics of all the people involved and people laugh as a social activity as opposed to as them themselves Being entertained by something in most cases.

349
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:38,660
Speaker 1: I must say that makes sense because if I watch Excel saga alone I don't laugh very much and I noticed that even though I think in my brain that what's happening is kind of funny.

350
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:49,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least a little bit like I listen any lizard, but when I watch Excel saga at anime club, I can't stop laughing like when I listen Eddie Izzard in the car Like I'm highly amused but I just kind of sit there.

351
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:57,302
Speaker 0: same thing We're listening to Lewis black on the mp3 But then I'm riding with Scott or Emily somewhere and we're listening to the same thing and I laugh so hard I almost cry.

352
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,933
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's it's not even like conscious like aha.

353
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,017
Speaker 1: I'm laughing to fit in.

354
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:03,040
Speaker 1: It's like I can't help it.

355
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:05,760
Speaker 1: It's actually like a contagion infectious thing.

356
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:13,910
Speaker 1: So yeah When you have a joke like the mo prank phone call and you see a group of people laughing at it It makes it funnier and easier to laugh at.

357
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,674
Speaker 0: All right.

358
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:15,579
Speaker 0: So what do you got for me?

359
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:17,485
Speaker 1: Here's a flash game.

360
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,651
Speaker 1: It's basically the premise of this flash.

361
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,534
Speaker 1: Oh, you're using this.

362
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:21,537
Speaker 0: this look pretty piss-poor.

363
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:22,440
Speaker 1: It is pretty piss-poor.

364
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,343
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

365
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:29,715
Speaker 1: yeah at the premise of the flash game is that you're standing there plus it's Thursday.

366
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:36,160
Speaker 0: people listening like the zombies remember Oh, yeah, but they keep saying something about some podcast doing a show about that whatever.

367
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:42,846
Speaker 1: so the premise of this game is you're the last guy making the last stand against the zombies and You're on the right side of the screen.

368
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:46,883
Speaker 1: and the zombies come from the left to the right and they as soon as the Sun Comes up they stop coming.

369
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,471
Speaker 1: You have a gun and you can shoot the zombies.

370
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:52,260
Speaker 1: you die if the zombies break your wall.

371
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:58,502
Speaker 1: So you click on the zombies and you move up and down to shoot them and you try to kill them all before they destroy Your wall.

372
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:02,120
Speaker 1: then every night you have 12 hours to spend doing stuff.

373
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:09,425
Speaker 1: You can spend your hours repairing your wall And if you choose to spend an hour repairing your wall It repairs by 5%.

374
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:10,127
Speaker 1: and you could choose.

375
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:16,702
Speaker 1: you could actually spend all 12 hours repairing the wall to repair it by I guess 60%.

376
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:30,000
Speaker 1: You could spend hours looking for weapons and as soon as you spend enough hours looking for weapons you find one and You could spend your hours looking for other survivors And if you find them they will hide with you behind the wall and help you shoot at the zombies.

377
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:35,986
Speaker 1: The problem is that this game while the premise is pretty awesome The execution is kind of poor.

378
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:45,140
Speaker 1: clicking on the zombies to kill them is very annoying because they take many shots to kill and the aiming Is pretty piss poor and even if you get all headshots it takes like two.

379
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:52,154
Speaker 0: I think the real problem is that actually playing the active part of the game shooting the zombies There's no strategy or skill or anything.

380
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:53,000
Speaker 0: It's just stupid.

381
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,940
Speaker 1: There was almost a strategy in that you're allowed to have two weapons at once and you could switch them out.

382
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:04,702
Speaker 1: So I was gonna have a strategy of unload the shotgun to kill a bunch of zombies and the shotgun reloads So slowly.

383
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:09,060
Speaker 1: I would just switch to the machine gun and then use that for the rest of the level because it reloads quickly.

384
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:15,859
Speaker 1: But I would still get a bunch of shotgun stuff off to clear the level out at the moment I needed it, but it doesn't let you switch weapons while reloading.

385
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,633
Speaker 1: So I empty the shotgun and I'm stuck reloading it even though I'm holding like this You know full up assault gun.

386
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:24,077
Speaker 1: in the other hand it sucked well.

387
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:31,720
Speaker 0: The real issue is what the game should have done is not even made that an active part and instead of could actually Controlling and shooting the zombies in this really crappy way.

388
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,720
Speaker 0: You just have people and you allocate them to parts of the wall and arm them with weapons.

389
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:36,566
Speaker 0: That would have been a much better.

390
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:47,060
Speaker 1: something even worse if you spend out You don't know exactly how many hours you have to spend to do certain things So you can't plan it out exactly even though there is a meter that says, you know How many hours until you find another weapon?

391
00:27:48,400 --> 00:28:01,180
Speaker 1: also getting the better weapons doesn't make it that much easier and Even if you find survivors to help you on the wall If you and when it becomes nighttime and you go out searching for things, you know searching for weapons again

392
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:02,645
Speaker 0: Those survivors

393
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:10,600
Speaker 1: are pretty much guaranteed to die while searching for other survivors and weapons So they don't stick around very long and you can't really build up a camp full of survivors.

394
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:17,500
Speaker 1: Basically, the game is just a really good premise with a really frustrating and tedious execution.

395
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,519
Speaker 0: We got to steal that premise and make a better game.

396
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,918
Speaker 1: Yes, but you should check it out because it killed five minutes of my day with entertainment.

397
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:25,640
Speaker 0: I wouldn't check it out.

398
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,330
Speaker 0: I saw what Scott was doing and realized it was crappy.

399
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:30,097
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's not worth your time.

400
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:30,840
Speaker 1: It's worth five minutes.

401
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,824
Speaker 0: No, it's not five minutes.

402
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:32,929
Speaker 0: It's not worth five minutes.

403
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,632
Speaker 1: Whatever.

404
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:35,480
Speaker 0: I won't spend five minutes on it.

405
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,526
Speaker 0: You can if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you.

406
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,068
Speaker 0: Okay.

407
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:42,160
Speaker 0: Now you could construe what Scott just did as a review.

408
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,514
Speaker 0: Perhaps that was a pretty good segue, wasn't it?

409
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:45,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty good.

410
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:55,219
Speaker 0: So tonight we're gonna review the concept of reviewing because I've noticed that in Most of the world as far as I can see it reviews are utter garbage that don't help you in any way.

411
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:57,767
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it comes down to this right.

412
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:18,971
Speaker 1: you look at all these blogs and these websites and these magazines and newspapers and people have been reviewing Entertainment making you know Commentaries on other works of art, you know, which are I guess are works of art themselves for as long as there's been art and People just seem to nowadays do it sort of reflexively.

413
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:29,140
Speaker 1: like a video game comes out people looking for the video game reviews you know, there's a movie people looking for the movie reviews and Video games suffer from this more than just about anything though.

414
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,869
Speaker 1: Yes, but I think people really have forgotten that.

415
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,558
Speaker 1: they've forgotten the purpose of a review.

416
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:40,593
Speaker 1: they've Sort of like not actually think about how they review things like.

417
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:57,617
Speaker 1: they sort of fallen into a formula of how things are reviewed and they follow it unthinkingly and We're creating a lot more reviews of products than actual products themselves And it's really just made this mess of useless stuff that people wade through.

418
00:29:57,637 --> 00:29:58,439
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

419
00:29:58,459 --> 00:30:10,995
Speaker 0: well I think the much more direct issue is simply that in the video game industry most reviews are pretty much blatantly paid off and crappy and Crappy in the sense that a video game doesn't get a bad review ever and people freak out of.

420
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:19,252
Speaker 0: a video game gets like an 8 out of 10 as unless it's like some kiddie game and even then The only reason they don't freak out is because the kids don't go on the inner tubes.

421
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:19,512
Speaker 1: Yep.

422
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:25,112
Speaker 1: So first let's discuss What is the purpose of reviewing things in the first now?

423
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:27,120
Speaker 0: I see two separate purposes of reviews.

424
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:29,631
Speaker 0: I mean and I think that a review can do one.

425
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:35,243
Speaker 0: the other or both of these and Movies you should see is actually a good example of a podcast that does both very well I think.

426
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:54,680
Speaker 0: on one hand review is Describe in such a way a thing that someone who has not seen it or done it or played it or bought it yet Can figure out if it's the kind of thing that they would probably like and it would be worth the money to them Without ruining the thing for them to the point that it ruins the experience or they don't get as much out of it.

427
00:30:55,383 --> 00:31:00,769
Speaker 1: Insert argument about how if something can be ruined that's Bad about the thing.

428
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,289
Speaker 0: but at the same time like Terminator 2 There was a thing that could have been ruined.

429
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:06,012
Speaker 0: that didn't matter.

430
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:08,300
Speaker 0: you can enjoy the movie with or without having that ruined.

431
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:15,440
Speaker 0: However, the original trailers to the movie ruined it already and totally fucked something that could have been amazing.

432
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,862
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about sports like about reviews But that's the thing.

433
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:30,449
Speaker 0: a review can not necessarily spoil something like oh so-and-so kill so-and-so in the end But they can spoil things about a movie or a game that had you discovered them on your own You probably would have enjoyed the movie more.

434
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:31,574
Speaker 1: Well, here's an example.

435
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,086
Speaker 1: There was a Ghostwriter is alright.

436
00:31:34,146 --> 00:31:37,300
Speaker 1: You mean he's a dude with a flaming skull on a bike with flaming wheel.

437
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:41,533
Speaker 0: I'd find the idea of ghost rider silly at best regardless.

438
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:43,660
Speaker 1: There was a ghost rider movie recently.

439
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:44,824
Speaker 1: I did not see this movie.

440
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,610
Speaker 1: I don't think rim saw the movie either.

441
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,300
Speaker 1: I have no intention of seeing this movie.

442
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:50,786
Speaker 0: However, I like how you said.

443
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:52,694
Speaker 0: you don't think like I might have snuck out and watched.

444
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:53,778
Speaker 1: you might have you might have.

445
00:31:54,961 --> 00:31:57,874
Speaker 1: There was a trailer for this movie for free on the internets.

446
00:31:58,276 --> 00:31:59,160
Speaker 1: I watched that trailer.

447
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,825
Speaker 1: I think I watched it one and a half times.

448
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:05,400
Speaker 1: that trailer gave me all the entertainment that the movie would have provided.

449
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,720
Speaker 1: I got to see a dude on a flaming with a flaming skull ride a flaming bike up the side of a building.

450
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,600
Speaker 0: You know, I get this problem.

451
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,483
Speaker 0: That's it much done.

452
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:15,860
Speaker 0: every comedy movie like every normal mainstream comedy movie that comes out in the u.s.

453
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:19,440
Speaker 0: All the scenes that are funnier in the trailer and I just don't bother with the stupid movie.

454
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:24,923
Speaker 1: So when you do review something you have to prove you have to give You have to.

455
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:32,247
Speaker 1: what you're sort of trying to do when I review something at least is when I experience a work of art Whatever medium it happens to be in.

456
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:33,873
Speaker 1: it gives me a feeling.

457
00:32:34,255 --> 00:33:02,157
Speaker 1: sometimes it gives a good feeling sometimes it gives a bad feeling, you know, and what I try to do when I review something is I'm Basically communicating to someone who has not yet experienced the work of art the feelings that I got when I experienced the work of art and I'm trying to do it also in such a way that they can predict based on what they know about themselves the type of feeling they will get if they were to experience the work of art in the same way that I experienced it.

458
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:13,360
Speaker 1: and I think that's really what you're trying to do without actually just giving them the work of art because The point of a review is that you have to go out of your way.

459
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Speaker 1: You have to spend money you have to spend time You have to go through a significant effort to experience a lot of works of art.

460
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,600
Speaker 1: You have to spend an hour in a movie theater You have to spend 30 hours in front of a video game console.

461
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,590
Speaker 1: You got to ride the train for 20 hours with their DS.

462
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:36,459
Speaker 1: You got to spend $20 in a DVD and you want people to know what they're getting into before they put through the effort to experience the work of art.

463
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:39,531
Speaker 1: and Yeah, that's what a review is all about now.

464
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:44,950
Speaker 0: at the same time along those lines Reviews are not and cannot be objective.

465
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:47,818
Speaker 0: the fact people always try to like this is an objective review.

466
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:48,480
Speaker 0: We have metrics.

467
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:49,503
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

468
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:53,493
Speaker 0: It's you gotta if someone's reviewing something you really have to.

469
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:55,920
Speaker 0: I mean you can try to take objective stances on certain.

470
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,180
Speaker 1: There are some things you can measure objectively.

471
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:05,280
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah use those as criteria in your review, but in the end those criteria themselves are subjective.

472
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,929
Speaker 0: I guess my point is don't pretend that your objective.

473
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:20,934
Speaker 0: instead just go all out and say this review is from my perspective And as a result if you're trying to filter media for yourself you go and find reviewers who you know Tend to like the things that you like and hopefully they'll recommend things that you like.

474
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:22,580
Speaker 0: case in point penny arcade.

475
00:34:23,484 --> 00:34:26,476
Speaker 0: I have very similar video game tastes to those two guys.

476
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:32,639
Speaker 0: as a result I tend to trust just about anything they say about video games and they have pretty much never steered me wrong.

477
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:37,355
Speaker 0: Dave and Joel are somewhat similar to and that I generally have similar taste in video games.

478
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,666
Speaker 0: if they tell me a game's good I'm probably going to like that game.

479
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:43,155
Speaker 1: Yep, especially when it comes to the shmups.

480
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:44,560
Speaker 1: They like the good shmups over.

481
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they hate Ikaruga even more than Scott does.

482
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:48,556
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is quite a feat.

483
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:52,397
Speaker 0: granted I hate Ikaruga more than anyone but that's just cuz I'm bad at shmups.

484
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:54,380
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, alright.

485
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,342
Speaker 0: Anyway, now.

486
00:34:55,463 --> 00:35:01,742
Speaker 0: the second possible purpose of a review is what I like to call the complete review or in gig nights as we call The final thoughts.

487
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:07,306
Speaker 0: that's the review where you're not really focusing on People who haven't seen it yet.

488
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:11,340
Speaker 0: You're reviewing something fully as kind of a companion to the media.

489
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:20,620
Speaker 0: So say we you watch I don't know the Watchmen movie that hasn't come out yet And then you go to see like the geek nights final thoughts or someone else's like full-on companion review.

490
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:26,660
Speaker 0: You basically go to hear someone else's opinion of the work as a whole in order to bring up points of discussion.

491
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:31,440
Speaker 0: Maybe realize things as symbolism you might have missed in the movie or in extra information about it.

492
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:37,000
Speaker 1: I think the purpose of a review like that is to sort of broaden your view.

493
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,619
Speaker 1: It's like you've seen a work of art from your perspective and now the reviews of other people have seen it.

494
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:53,200
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the same reason after you see a movie with all your friends you discuss it with each other so that you can sort of Conglomerate all your different perspectives into a unified perspective.

495
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:00,720
Speaker 1: So a review of something you've already experienced is sort of increasing your you know vision of the work and broadening the hurt.

496
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,387
Speaker 1: You know the work itself in a way from where you're sitting now.

497
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:19,771
Speaker 0: a hidden part of all that is not just the broadening your horizons and realizing, you know things you might not have noticed, but there's the secret pleasure of reliving the moments in the movie or the book or the game or whatever that Really really made it stand out to you.

498
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:23,239
Speaker 0: and I get this the most when I listen to movies You should see and I actually emailed them about this.

499
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:28,678
Speaker 0: I get much more enjoyment about when I listen to a review of a movie that I've already seen.

500
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:35,194
Speaker 0: now They're trying to sell me, you know, check out this movie, but I've already seen the movie But I kind of wait like when they reviewed seven.

501
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:36,100
Speaker 0: I wait.

502
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:43,343
Speaker 0: I just want to hear them talk about My favorite scene in the movie or the scene that I thought was awesome like the time when the guy did the thing to the Other guy.

503
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:51,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's not so much what they say It's just the fact that they reference it and the synapses in the brain go off and I kind of relive this moment vicariously through them.

504
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:58,319
Speaker 1: well because experiencing the moment because you have this work of art that you experience and it gave you certain feelings and you want it.

505
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:02,593
Speaker 1: it's not Easy to replicate feelings again, you can remember them.

506
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:20,640
Speaker 1: It's it's weird how you can have feelings Remember what the feelings felt like but not consciously create those same feelings again, you know Sometimes they happen, but it's very difficult And I think you need to like achieve some sort of Zen Buddhism enlightenment to actually be able to just make them happen whenever you want.

507
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:36,175
Speaker 1: So listening to a review of say I don't know full metal alchemist after you watched It is a really good way to help you get the feelings back because you aren't you know The freaking Dalai Lama or anything like it'll remind you about like.

508
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:47,411
Speaker 0: actually last night I was flipping through music kind of randomly and Emily was reading and I Randomly just hit on the last song that they play in cowboy bebop And I was just kind of struck suddenly by like.

509
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:51,768
Speaker 0: all the memories and emotions of the end of cowboy bebop Just flooded back to me and I sat there going.

510
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:52,612
Speaker 0: Whoa.

511
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:54,299
Speaker 0: That was a fucking awesome show.

512
00:37:55,521 --> 00:38:00,180
Speaker 0: It's not like I forgot at the end of cowboy bebop or that cowboy bebop as a whole was amazing.

513
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,020
Speaker 0: I was just suddenly and viscerally reminded of it and reviews can serve that same purpose.

514
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:12,060
Speaker 0: I really think that reviews can serve either or both of these purposes and that they're both entirely legitimate and necessary.

515
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:20,617
Speaker 1: so why The reviews suck, I think the first reason reviews suck is because people forget these purposes.

516
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:24,352
Speaker 1: they just They don't know that thinking it's diary out the mouth.

517
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:26,300
Speaker 0: It's the would you read your own blog syndrome?

518
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,065
Speaker 1: Then they're not thinking about.

519
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:34,791
Speaker 1: let me make something so that people who haven't yet experienced this work of art Will you know what the work of art is like?

520
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:40,875
Speaker 1: they're not thinking hey People who've already seen this will read this and they'll relive it and get enjoyment.

521
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:47,420
Speaker 1: They're just thinking I Experience this thing bla bla bla bla bla say everything I can think to say about it bla bla bla bla bla.

522
00:38:47,680 --> 00:39:00,040
Speaker 0: I really think that the reason a lot of reviews particularly on to internet suck is that the majority of people I believe This is my opinion on the internet who have a blog and they review stuff Review for only one of two reasons.

523
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:07,283
Speaker 0: Reason number one in a sad attempt to somehow get into the video game or whatever industry and hopes that people will send them Free shit.

524
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:13,730
Speaker 1: I think there are a lot of people who review things To hope that an industry will send them things to review.

525
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:14,372
Speaker 1: there are.

526
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:19,453
Speaker 0: there are those people number two to be the zero-day guy And get attention like the iPhone comes out.

527
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,740
Speaker 0: the iPhones popular.

528
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:29,254
Speaker 0: They want to review it as soon as they can in order to ride the wave of the items Popularity as much as they can for whatever stupid reason like ads.

529
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:34,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are people who do that I also agree, but I think there is a some other reasons.

530
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:35,539
Speaker 1: people review things on the internet.

531
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:42,440
Speaker 1: one thing is that people want to make a blog or a site right and They don't really have interesting things in their lives.

532
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:47,418
Speaker 1: you know, I mean most people at least it seems like a lot of people I mean us included.

533
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:57,480
Speaker 1: a significant portion of their lives are defined by the Artwork and entertainment and culture that they consume especially in this consumer culture we have here.

534
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:15,033
Speaker 1: Yeah us when they want to blog, you know a log or a journal most of that is going to consist of talking about the Culture that they consume and that sort of amounts to what we call Reviewing things and people just do it because there's not much else.

535
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:18,679
Speaker 1: They have to say that you know It's like if someone makes a blog what do they have to say?

536
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,471
Speaker 1: They spent all day playing video games and watching TV.

537
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:26,219
Speaker 1: Guess what their blogs gonna be about the video games They played the TV they watched.

538
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:34,460
Speaker 0: I think another major problem that comes up very often is the fact that a lot of people for various reasons Just don't give negative reviews.

539
00:40:35,222 --> 00:40:40,720
Speaker 0: I mean some people give like the funny negative reviews like the angry video game nerd who I crack up just thinking about him.

540
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,469
Speaker 1: They're very angry video game nerd.

541
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,540
Speaker 1: I love that guy is so awesome.

542
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:45,423
Speaker 0: I mean one.

543
00:40:45,463 --> 00:40:46,406
Speaker 0: he gives really good reviews.

544
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:50,980
Speaker 0: these old games - I relive that the fucking jump in turtles.

545
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:53,394
Speaker 1: He he days got every base covered.

546
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:57,934
Speaker 1: if you haven't played it You see what it's all about without getting it ruined you.

547
00:40:57,954 --> 00:41:02,980
Speaker 1: if you have played it You relive the suckiness and he's entertaining all at the same time.

548
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,807
Speaker 1: He's got like this trifecta.

549
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:14,680
Speaker 1: He conquers both purposes of a review while Simultaneously his review itself is an entertaining work on its own that could be reviewed.

550
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:25,240
Speaker 0: But like look at most podcasters when they talk about other podcasts Very rarely will a podcaster say anything negative about another podcast unless it's geek nights because we'll say podcasts suck all the time.

551
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,000
Speaker 0: I was gonna get to that cuz we're gonna launch a new famous for that.

552
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:32,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, we get a lot of ire from a lot of podcasters for kind of they say we're dicks.

553
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:45,920
Speaker 0: But all I have to say about that is the last time we were kind of down on a podcast We got more than 14. and when I say more than 14, I mean we got 15 emails or forum posts from 14 different people.

554
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:53,260
Speaker 0: Well 15 different people who all said man you were totally down on that podcast and they said you were assholes.

555
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:57,900
Speaker 0: But then I listened to you and I realized that you were right and I stopped listening to that crappy podcast.

556
00:41:58,021 --> 00:41:59,608
Speaker 0: You've shown me the way or something like that.

557
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:00,492
Speaker 0: I'm dead serious.

558
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:01,959
Speaker 0: We got a lot of emails like that.

559
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:11,808
Speaker 0: yeah, it happens and uh We're gonna start doing that a lot more not just a podcast but to everything because I think you've known us long enough to Know that when we review something we don't pull the punches.

560
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:17,627
Speaker 0: No, I mean we gave kinetic on last year a Pretty bad review overall.

561
00:42:17,888 --> 00:42:26,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though we really like the people who run kinetic on and this year We gave a very awesome review and the reason was kinetic on Did awesome this year.

562
00:42:26,668 --> 00:42:28,455
Speaker 0: if Otacon had a crappy year we'd say it.

563
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:41,480
Speaker 1: if Otacon had an awesome year I think part of what it is is that we're not fanboys of anything pretty much and We concentrate mostly on the negative because the negative is where there's things to say that are interesting.

564
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,368
Speaker 1: I mean if something's good, what do you have to say?

565
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:44,413
Speaker 1: It was great.

566
00:42:44,775 --> 00:42:45,257
Speaker 1: I liked it.

567
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:45,920
Speaker 1: It was fun.

568
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:48,080
Speaker 0: It made me feel I don't know I can say a lot about something.

569
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:51,756
Speaker 0: I mean I could talk for hours and hours about cowboy bebop or antenna and just like.

570
00:42:51,796 --> 00:42:53,944
Speaker 1: you're not gonna talk about But you're not gonna be.

571
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,050
Speaker 1: you can't talk about how it was good.

572
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:02,347
Speaker 1: You got to talk about like some other things like, you know the interesting Symbolisms in the plot.

573
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:08,475
Speaker 0: honestly, I could do a whole show just talking about why it was good Like it was good because of these factors in the way they were executed.

574
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:09,660
Speaker 0: That's a good hour of talking.

575
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:15,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can't talk about the actual goodness itself, but you can talk about the badness itself.

576
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:16,247
Speaker 1: Well, it's easy.

577
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:23,040
Speaker 0: I think more to the point It's easier to be funny when you're talking about something that sucks and that's what makes Dave and Joel amazing.

578
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:26,948
Speaker 1: Yes, but anyway, yeah We seem to basically everything.

579
00:43:26,968 --> 00:43:34,120
Speaker 1: we seem to concentrate on the negative and we say everything that's negative And then we say if we didn't say something was negative assume it was positive.

580
00:43:34,602 --> 00:43:39,699
Speaker 1: so even when we give an awesome review of something we end up just listing the few bad things it had.

581
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:51,173
Speaker 0: and Yeah, well the other thing is and this happens a lot with people who are friends with other people who create content Is that they're afraid to step outside of the friendship and objectively give criticism to each other.

582
00:43:52,015 --> 00:43:58,960
Speaker 0: and I warn you podcast world We might be talking about a lot of podcasts in the future.

583
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:07,503
Speaker 1: yeah, well also I think that sort of branches that same idea into fanboys and where someone is a fanboy of say Megaman.

584
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:08,689
Speaker 1: so they won't give.

585
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:20,780
Speaker 1: they won't say anything negative about a Megaman game Even if it was a really sucky Megaman game that they barely played or they'll keep playing it and tell themselves They like it when they don't because they're such a fan of it as if you know Megaman is their friend.

586
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:26,840
Speaker 1: Just like if I was friends with an author I wouldn't negatively review their book, you know, or my my review of their book could be tainted.

587
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,955
Speaker 1: And while of course every review is biased period every review is tainted.

588
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:48,810
Speaker 1: There are certain conflicts of interest that can occur to make a review extremely tainted and incredibly biased to the point at which it's not really useful and it doesn't serve the purposes of the review and when that happens Not good.

589
00:44:49,438 --> 00:45:02,699
Speaker 0: So originally our idea was and we came up with this pretty much today or yesterday was that we would Every Thursday or every other Thursday or whenever we got around to it We just take like one or two podcasts and just review them real quick.

590
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,689
Speaker 0: You know spend five minutes and just talk about.

591
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:07,203
Speaker 0: you know, this is a podcast worth listening to this one Isn't?

592
00:45:07,224 --> 00:45:09,404
Speaker 0: here's why it's good years wide span just using quick reviews.

593
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:19,040
Speaker 0: and the feedback we got when we proposed this idea in the forums was Why just podcast review stuff all the time randomly make like a five-minute bit and you know what we're gonna do that.

594
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,597
Speaker 1: I think basically what's happened here on geek nights is because we cover one thing per day.

595
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:30,640
Speaker 1: pretty much I mean four things a week and there's a lot more things out there than four things a week and not just reviews.

596
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:36,660
Speaker 0: They're actually trying to shy away from Reviewing stuff all the time and do a lot more topical shows because I think they're a lot more interesting.

597
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:50,426
Speaker 1: yep, and not only that but There are a lot of things out there that say I played a video game rim hasn't played it or I read a comic rim Hasn't read it or rim watched a movie I haven't seen it.

598
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:58,247
Speaker 1: or there are things where we have something to say about it But not enough to fill a whole show, you know, and there's a lot of stuff We just don't get to.

599
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:00,920
Speaker 1: even though we have something to say it never gets said.

600
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:05,900
Speaker 1: So we're gonna add a new segment that could show up in any geek night's show randomly.

601
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,720
Speaker 1: You never know when you're gonna see it where we just do really short reviews of stuff like BAM.

602
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,720
Speaker 1: Here's a review of this video game or BAM is a review of this book.

603
00:46:14,562 --> 00:46:20,360
Speaker 1: You know just really quick five minutes or less just to get more stuff out there, you know stuff.

604
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,719
Speaker 1: We have to say we could use it to pad out the episodes or you don't have a lot to say.

605
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:28,615
Speaker 0: Now the big part of all this is that they're not.

606
00:46:28,635 --> 00:46:32,580
Speaker 0: they're gonna be so short You know a few three or four or five minutes that they're not gonna be straight up reviews.

607
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:35,669
Speaker 0: I'd almost call them recommendations or anti recommendations.

608
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,314
Speaker 0: It's basically gonna be.

609
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:39,120
Speaker 0: here's something that you'll pry like.

610
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,550
Speaker 0: Here's something that you probably won't like.

611
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,577
Speaker 0: here's a few reasons why.

612
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:45,096
Speaker 1: yeah I mean, I guess I just did basically an example.

613
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:58,345
Speaker 1: as my thing of the day I gave a recommend anti recommendation or slight recommendation for a flash game on a web page and That's the sort of thing you can expect if we you know in this segment that we're going to create that We don't have a name for yet.

614
00:46:58,907 --> 00:47:00,937
Speaker 0: So all of that said suffice to say etc, etc.

615
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,083
Speaker 0: Yep, it's back.

616
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:03,926
Speaker 0: We're both.

617
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:07,920
Speaker 0: we're gonna start it tonight just by giving a quick recommendation review of a couple of random things.

618
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:09,966
Speaker 0: Cool I think we'll start with you.

619
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:11,009
Speaker 1: Well me.

620
00:47:11,149 --> 00:47:11,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, go ahead.

621
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:12,473
Speaker 0: Are you not ready?

622
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:16,955
Speaker 1: No, I try cuz the name of my Thing I'm gonna talk about is different.

623
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:17,660
Speaker 0: All right, fine.

624
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,900
Speaker 1: So let me maybe I'll think of something different to talk about.

625
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,061
Speaker 1: So

626
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:33,113
Speaker 0: anyway, the friend of ours Alex who works with us and collaborates a lot of the projects we do lives in Beacon And definitely one of the earliest and most senior members of the front row crew Recommended to me because he reads a lot more fantasy books than I do.

627
00:47:33,173 --> 00:47:36,129
Speaker 0: even though I really like fantasy books A lot of them are really bad.

628
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:37,860
Speaker 0: So I kind of try to get recommendations from him.

629
00:47:38,401 --> 00:47:48,997
Speaker 0: He suggested to me partly because he said that I kind of reminded him of one of the main characters Which as I read the books was a somewhat dubious honor, I guess.

630
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:51,045
Speaker 0: Yeah But these books are.

631
00:47:51,185 --> 00:47:57,736
Speaker 0: it's a series of books that I'm just gonna call the Prince of Nothing by Canadian author R Scott Becker or Baker bak k?

632
00:47:57,817 --> 00:47:57,877
Speaker 0: er.

633
00:47:57,998 --> 00:48:11,512
Speaker 0: and If you like Tolkien the or any kind of like hard Dark hard-hitting Serious high fantasy not kidding around not for kids Really?

634
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:14,086
Speaker 0: Well-written Badass fantasy books.

635
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,314
Speaker 0: These are so up your alley.

636
00:48:16,474 --> 00:48:17,939
Speaker 0: You could you can't believe it.

637
00:48:18,702 --> 00:48:23,817
Speaker 0: I read the first two pretty much immediately and I'm ravenous for the rest of them.

638
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:27,468
Speaker 0: I Don't really want to spoil anything about what they're about.

639
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:29,334
Speaker 0: suffice to say the writing style.

640
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,120
Speaker 0: say yeah, I threw that in there.

641
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:44,769
Speaker 0: Yeah suffice to say The writing style is Somewhat fantastic and I'm not gonna even quote anything because I want you to find all of these Literary gems by yourself and you know them when they come.

642
00:48:45,331 --> 00:48:52,259
Speaker 0: I believe one of my favorites was a sentence that ends in the words And then they attempted to enter the circle inscribed by his sword.

643
00:48:53,085 --> 00:48:53,407
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

644
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:55,180
Speaker 0: This is some high fucking fantasy.

645
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,759
Speaker 0: It's absolutely amazing.

646
00:48:57,221 --> 00:49:10,980
Speaker 0: And also if you've been listening to the podcast 12 Byzantine emperors or you know anything about the Crusades Or Byzantine history or anything like that You're gonna realize that these draw heavily from the Crusades in a very awesome way.

647
00:49:11,843 --> 00:49:13,698
Speaker 0: Alright, I cannot recommend these books enough.

648
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:16,485
Speaker 0: So Scott, what do you got for me?

649
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:24,850
Speaker 1: Alright, it took time to find this on the internet because it was slightly problematic Alright, but anyway, there's a manga that just came out from CMX.

650
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:25,772
Speaker 1: who's the DC?

651
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,620
Speaker 1: CMX, you know, it's DC comic.

652
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,127
Speaker 0: They're the ones who just picked up toki wo kaka or shoujo.

653
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:36,002
Speaker 1: Yes, and it's a manga called samurai commando mission 1549.

654
00:49:36,002 --> 00:49:37,529
Speaker 1: That's the name of it in English.

655
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:39,880
Speaker 1: I don't think that's the actual name of it in Japanese.

656
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:44,797
Speaker 1: I did see the actual name of it Japanese in the back of the book But I forgot it and I'll have the book on hand.

657
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:49,580
Speaker 1: It was based on a novel and I think there was also a movie whatever.

658
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,222
Speaker 1: basically, it's an.

659
00:49:51,744 --> 00:49:52,466
Speaker 1: it's an awesome.

660
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:53,328
Speaker 1: awesome.

661
00:49:53,429 --> 00:50:05,449
Speaker 1: if you are liking the militaries or if you were liking the samurais or if you were liking the Japanese histories or even just a sci-fi time-travel story This is a manga that will provide now.

662
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:13,012
Speaker 1: It's not some amazing knock your socks off manga But it's basically one of those manga where if you have a particular interest.

663
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:15,900
Speaker 1: it tweaks the fancy quite vigorously.

664
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:27,684
Speaker 1: It's a story of oh, man's some guy went back in time a real military guy from the present with tanks and guns Killed Nobunaga and Started making a castle.

665
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:28,667
Speaker 1: and what's he up to?

666
00:50:29,248 --> 00:50:43,212
Speaker 1: and of course, this is destroying the present because you know time paradox and His sort of follower from when he was in the present, you know Goes back in time to stop him and crazy stuff happens.

667
00:50:43,894 --> 00:50:45,500
Speaker 1: I read the first volume on the train.

668
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,389
Speaker 1: I think it's only two volumes.

669
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:52,171
Speaker 1: So hey pretty damn cheap The art it was actually.

670
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:54,200
Speaker 1: it's it's standard manga arts.

671
00:50:54,642 --> 00:51:03,214
Speaker 1: But if you actually read about the artists in the back like the art studio They apparently made the art with almost no effort whatsoever compared to normal artists.

672
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:05,260
Speaker 1: So it's like whoa, they made this easily.

673
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,789
Speaker 1: what could they have made if they had spent a lot more time?

674
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:13,820
Speaker 1: and Yeah, I mean the thing is the character designs are not too exciting.

675
00:51:14,423 --> 00:51:17,520
Speaker 1: The some of the action scenes are kind of like how what just happened?

676
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,263
Speaker 1: It's not like you.

677
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:21,073
Speaker 1: follow the action and there's an exciting action going on.

678
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:21,836
Speaker 1: It's just oh.

679
00:51:21,976 --> 00:51:23,000
Speaker 1: they shot the guy up.

680
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,957
Speaker 1: They stabbed the guy.

681
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:29,294
Speaker 1: But the plotline itself is pretty complex and pretty intriguing.

682
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:29,936
Speaker 1: as to who?

683
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:31,400
Speaker 1: what's they gonna happen next?

684
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,039
Speaker 1: Oh, what's that guy thinking?

685
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,325
Speaker 0: What's they going to have?

686
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:36,931
Speaker 1: what's they gonna happen next?

687
00:51:37,151 --> 00:51:38,998
Speaker 0: That was grammatically amazing.

688
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:40,779
Speaker 1: It was so happy.

689
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:56,880
Speaker 1: So, yeah If you are looking for a manga to read and you're bored of the usual Shonen jumps in the shoujo beats and you want some military Japanese history type stuff samurai commando mission 1549 is worth the price of paying for it.

690
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,620
Speaker 1: And also I actually recently read the Wikipedia of Nobunaga and a lot of the Japanese history stuff in there is actually pretty accurate.

691
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:10,640
Speaker 1: So if you're a fan of the alternate history type stuff, this will also tweak your fancy quite well score.

692
00:52:11,142 --> 00:52:13,300
Speaker 0: So on that note expect more of this in the future.

693
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:18,745
Speaker 0: It'll probably become some sort of a. I mean, you know now the show is the formats pretty, you know We've got the news.

694
00:52:19,087 --> 00:52:21,300
Speaker 0: the music plays to the thing of the day and then we do the main bit.

695
00:52:21,922 --> 00:52:28,698
Speaker 0: I imagine that this bit and possibly other bits we had in the future the more of them will probably test in the experimental feed But I think this one's already fine.

696
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:33,560
Speaker 0: They'll probably just occur at the same place but semi randomly whenever we get around to them.

697
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:36,376
Speaker 1: I think actually the end of the show is not a bad place.

698
00:52:36,516 --> 00:52:36,999
Speaker 0: I think so, too.

699
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:50,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean other podcasts I know like that the comic geek speak they do towards the end of their show like hey They call it off the rack and they're just like hey Anyone want to talk about a comic they read recently and people do like the same thing but comics only

700
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:50,540
Speaker 0: also.

701
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:53,319
Speaker 0: I kind of got an idea because it wouldn't be that much more work to do.

702
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:58,251
Speaker 0: If you guys really like these segments and they're short It wouldn't be that far out of the way to.

703
00:52:58,352 --> 00:53:03,672
Speaker 0: in addition to just having them in the normal show We could take that audio separately and make a feed.

704
00:53:03,712 --> 00:53:05,920
Speaker 0: That's just all of our like geek nights flash reviews.

705
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if you want to do that.

706
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:08,231
Speaker 1: we could.

707
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,720
Speaker 0: I guess I'm willing to do it.

708
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,878
Speaker 0: It wouldn't take much effort at all.

709
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:19,377
Speaker 0: And that's I mean a lot of people only listen to one or two nights of the show and a lot of people find Things like this like they like to have an archive of things like that in iTunes.

710
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:25,380
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, I'm thinking of doing that for a lot of our bits someday in the future once I can automate the process better.

711
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:25,882
Speaker 0: Yep.

712
00:53:26,323 --> 00:53:26,665
