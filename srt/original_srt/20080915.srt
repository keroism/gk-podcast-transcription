1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,647
Speaker 0: It's Monday September 15th.

2
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:12,490
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,848
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight IPV6.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,603
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:33,864
Speaker 0: I live I'm back.

6
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:35,048
Speaker 1: That's not good.

7
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,816
Speaker 0: I'm no longer hacking up my lungs.

8
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,820
Speaker 0: I'm no longer sick.

9
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:38,809
Speaker 0: It's a good feeling.

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:47,620
Speaker 1: you know last week I was like really wanted to do episodes, and I still want to do episodes too I mean, but I don't want to do them as much as I wanted to do them last week.

11
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:49,166
Speaker 1: It's all your fault.

12
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,414
Speaker 0: Oh, so you don't want to do the show.

13
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,562
Speaker 0: we could just stop right now I do.

14
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:54,080
Speaker 1: I just don't want to do it as much as I want to do it before.

15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,186
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, I think you just want to do things you get.

16
00:00:56,247 --> 00:01:00,540
Speaker 1: a few people are getting a slightly lesser quality show because of rims.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,403
Speaker 1: Non-immunity to illness.

18
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:06,857
Speaker 1: you know I said in the house full of sick people for a week and nothing happened to me.

19
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:10,840
Speaker 0: all right Let's chalk that up to your sedentary lifestyle.

20
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:13,965
Speaker 1: I Shouldn't be so.

21
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,575
Speaker 1: you're saying the sedentary lifestyle is a barrier now.

22
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:17,880
Speaker 0: It's more that I guess I get out.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,128
Speaker 0: I'm exposed to more things.

24
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,860
Speaker 0: I put myself at more risk for greater reward.

25
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:25,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, I think that's definitely the cause.

26
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,673
Speaker 1: no I think how could I be at more risk than in-house for the sick people.

27
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:33,432
Speaker 0: you pretty much avoided us And we avoided you though It's not it's same house.

28
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:33,876
Speaker 1: It's all good.

29
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:45,680
Speaker 0: anyway We're back and to make up for the fact that the only show we did last week was a somewhat Abbreviated Friday night party line where I basically sat there quiet or slowly went off and rambling tangents because I was sick and tired.

30
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:48,059
Speaker 0: But we're gonna do three shows this week.

31
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:55,540
Speaker 0: So I guess the way I would put it is it's a Monday Wednesday week, and we just we're gonna do a Tuesday to be nice.

32
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:58,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've got too much packs that we still have.

33
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,864
Speaker 0: not I think.

34
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:05,580
Speaker 0: all told we're gonna be able to say that there were at least seven episodes directly caused by going to packs.

35
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:09,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much Luckily only two maybe three of them.

36
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:12,800
Speaker 0: I think three and a half of them are going to be about packs and the rest are just tertiary.

37
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're gonna do some tech news, right?

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,820
Speaker 1: But we've got how many like weeks worth of tech news we haven't talked about.

39
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,251
Speaker 0: And the worst thing is I have this list of like nine articles.

40
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,695
Speaker 0: I really wanted to talk about.

41
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,367
Speaker 0: I mean last Monday I had a ton of news.

42
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:32,408
Speaker 0: I wanted to talk about if I hadn't been sick, but Scott has some news.

43
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,938
Speaker 0: that kind of is just breaking that.

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,896
Speaker 0: Really it made us kind of have to forget about all that other BS I got.

45
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:45,920
Speaker 1: all these news is no I got to do one that I just saw Just now a second before we started doing the show and worse than that, right?

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,879
Speaker 1: It's like Apple put out there like new nano and whatnot, right?

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,685
Speaker 1: Well, we got two.

48
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:57,251
Speaker 1: Apple news is but they're not related in any way to the announcements They just made which were pretty in.

49
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 0: I know I mean pretty much though I mean the feeling I had is like man.

50
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,950
Speaker 0: I totally got to talk about all this awesome news.

51
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:06,792
Speaker 0: and then someone walks into the room and they're like, oh, hey Microsoft went open source.

52
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:10,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, a hundred percent Damn savers repealed.

53
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:14,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bill Gates just wrote you personally a check for a million dollars because he felt like it.

54
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:14,742
Speaker 1: Yeah.

55
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I feel like right now.

56
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:16,489
Speaker 0: Of course.

57
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:17,975
Speaker 0: It's not the good news.

58
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:19,080
Speaker 0: It's actually the bad news.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,597
Speaker 0: It's more like Microsoft sued Linus Torvalds and then shot him.

60
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:29,780
Speaker 0: Yep Oh, well, so I gotta I'll talk about this first because once we get on to Scott's news, there's really no turning back.

61
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:36,840
Speaker 0: so Apple in their infinite wisdom has decided that this a scourge has got to end.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,720
Speaker 0: They're done with this bullshit and they're gonna file a patent to make sure that people don't pull this crap off anymore.

63
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,603
Speaker 0: No more shenanigans, you see Apparently, oh, no.

64
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,064
Speaker 0: No, you know what?

65
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,130
Speaker 0: I'll quote from the patent application.

66
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,079
Speaker 0: quote Apple.

67
00:03:51,762 --> 00:04:08,710
Speaker 0: Some people have taken it upon themselves To remove the sensor from the special pocket of the iPod linked Nike plus shoe Place it in inappropriate locations like the shoelaces or place it on non Nike plus shoes.

68
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:10,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:30,864
Speaker 0: So Apple is filing a patent for clothing DRM in order to try to make it illegal and in and/or You to take this little cheap sensor from this Nike shoe that's special and branded for Apple and Put it on anything else or must with it or move it to the shoelaces.

70
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,470
Speaker 1: Well, I guess think about this, right?

71
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:43,416
Speaker 1: I mean, you know shoes look different and some shoes feel different and fit people's feet Differently and some shoes are better for one thing or better for another thing, you know It makes a difference.

72
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:51,010
Speaker 1: or I mean no shoe is gonna let you jump as high as Michael Jordan And a Chuck Taylor or in well Air Jordans.

73
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,770
Speaker 0: There's a difference between cross trainers and running shoes, right?

74
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,597
Speaker 0: If you're running by where cross train.

75
00:04:55,697 --> 00:05:05,730
Speaker 1: Apple made this deal with Nike for this Nike plus thing And basically what they did is is alright We'll put this technology in the iPhone that links it with your Nike shoes so you can track.

76
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,820
Speaker 1: You know, you're running or whatever and you know, it's it.

77
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:19,450
Speaker 1: people are having a lot of fun these days You know having pedometers and all sorts of things like that and heart monitors to to track their physical fitness stuff Combining the workout with the technology.

78
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:31,381
Speaker 1: So the deal with Apple and Nike did the whole point of it was Nike's like hey If we get if we're the only people who are allowed to put this technology in our clothing We'll sell a bunch of Nike shit, and then it's

79
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:31,642
Speaker 0: not

80
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,550
Speaker 1: see Nike logos all over the place.

81
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:38,476
Speaker 0: But the patent is not for you know Someone else making a similar device?

82
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:45,757
Speaker 0: the patent is to prevent you from taking the device that's in the Nike and putting it in Because they about Nike.

83
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:51,681
Speaker 1: right, you know, if you were just let's say you're just trying to sell shoes Oh, wouldn't you just make the best shoe and then people would buy it.

84
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,910
Speaker 1: but they slap Nike logos on everything.

85
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:03,597
Speaker 1: And the reason is because a lot of what you know clothing is is you have your brand on the clothing So people see it and if people don't see it Then it sort of defeats the purpose.

86
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:10,050
Speaker 1: and they Nike made this deal with Apple You know, they're paying money to make sure that you know.

87
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,462
Speaker 1: Those things are only in Nike shoes and people see.

88
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,110
Speaker 0: Nike logos are the amazing thing.

89
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:16,601
Speaker 0: It's not like you can pirate that sensor.

90
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,370
Speaker 0: anyone who has that sensor?

91
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:24,010
Speaker 0: Someone along the chain bought for money a Nike shoe that had it, right?

92
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,498
Speaker 1: But you know if Nike what is gonna sell?

93
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:34,624
Speaker 1: you a shoe and then somehow you were going to be able to Wear that shoe, but no one sees the Nike logos and and you're basically denying them.

94
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,850
Speaker 1: It's like the shoe comes with advertising.

95
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,598
Speaker 1: It's like you're taking the ads out.

96
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,110
Speaker 1: if you're gonna take the ads out they would have charged you more.

97
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,326
Speaker 0: What I like is that you basically pay for the privilege of the advertising.

98
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:45,050
Speaker 1: I know right?

99
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,350
Speaker 1: So it's like they're selling you a shoe that is subsidized by the advertising on the shoe.

100
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,776
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the high school fashion.

101
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:54,270
Speaker 0: I mean kids were I guess the Abercrombie or whatever and Abercrombie.

102
00:06:54,631 --> 00:07:05,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I granted I'll admit most of my clothing was from Abercrombie when I was a kid I I just had clothing that was just colors part of that just because I really only went shopping in the mall.

103
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,909
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's like most of their clothing is basically just a normal t-shirt that says their brand on the front of it.

104
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:17,974
Speaker 0: But I just I think Nike's worry too is that once the Nike shoe wears out No one's gonna buy.

105
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:21,490
Speaker 0: well geeks at least aren't gonna buy another Nike shoe to get another sensor.

106
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,589
Speaker 0: There's gonna keep taking the sensor and putting it on their new balances.

107
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:31,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz if you that yeah, if you if you're stuck with the shoe wears out, but the technology like that doesn't.

108
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,861
Speaker 0: yeah Cuz the thing is I mean most people.

109
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:39,670
Speaker 0: if you're not active I mean shoes last a long time, but if you're a runner you'll go through like two pairs of shoes a season.

110
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:41,598
Speaker 1: No, depending on what shoe you get.

111
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:47,470
Speaker 1: Well any if you're actually around where you run You're running like a gym and like a shit with a shiny floor.

112
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,285
Speaker 0: No If you're a runner and you run every day even on a shiny floor gym with the best running shoes in the world Those things are gonna wear the fuck out.

113
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:00,030
Speaker 0: but anyway This patent like it bothers me.

114
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:06,614
Speaker 0: The Apple fanboys came out of the woodwork and they basically said no no Apple's not being evil.

115
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:13,192
Speaker 0: Nike is forcing them to do this because if they don't then Nike you'll get mad and they'll take their business Elsewhere.

116
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:20,014
Speaker 0: or Nike's forced him to do it because of the licensing deal and they have to do good faith and blah blah blah blah And more and more.

117
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,401
Speaker 0: I feel like I've got shenanigans on that.

118
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:26,970
Speaker 0: I just I don't feel like Apple can use.

119
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,910
Speaker 1: Apple makes the technology here.

120
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,575
Speaker 1: They hold all the cards.

121
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,806
Speaker 1: Nike is probably paying them for the exclusivity.

122
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,227
Speaker 0: not yet.

123
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:43,197
Speaker 0: every time Apple has a anyone gets mad about Apple DRM that people always seem to say no No, no, they're forcing Apple to do it.

124
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,322
Speaker 0: They're forced Apple to do it.

125
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,310
Speaker 1: Apple is the DRM King.

126
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the company that doesn't want you to put their OS on another piece of hardware.

127
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,325
Speaker 1: It's the company that has DRM in their iTunes store.

128
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:55,330
Speaker 1: It's the company.

129
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,842
Speaker 1: All right, Apple is DRM everything.

130
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:00,192
Speaker 1: this is not Nike's idea All right.

131
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,470
Speaker 0: So speaking of DRM because I just had to talk about this but Scott let it rip.

132
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:20,050
Speaker 1: so the one thing we've always said right is that We need a portable device that there's no Technological reason that this should not exist and shit could have existed three years ago, right the PSP basically does it?

133
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,530
Speaker 1: Yeah a piece of portable technology with Wi-Fi and or cell phone in it.

134
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:36,461
Speaker 1: Right that can get wireless data that can subscribe to download and play Podcasts on its own without any other device helping it.

135
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,026
Speaker 1: There is no technological reason.

136
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,090
Speaker 1: This couldn't happen, right?

137
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:47,066
Speaker 1: all you need is pretty much a headphone hole a Processor some flash memory and a Wi-Fi card and a CPU.

138
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:47,748
Speaker 1: That's all I said.

139
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,194
Speaker 1: processor That's all you need.

140
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,400
Speaker 1: you connect those four things.

141
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:51,023
Speaker 1: You're done.

142
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,470
Speaker 1: That's the whole technology right there.

143
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,110
Speaker 1: I guess you need a screen and a user interface.

144
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:06,350
Speaker 0: I want to preface this whole discussion by pointing out that it is my belief and the belief of a lot of people that Podcasting and kind of independent non radio audio in general and video - yeah.

145
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,941
Speaker 0: But I think audio is the thing that could benefit the most.

146
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:24,979
Speaker 0: Yeah is basically floundering and the reason it is is that People want to just listen to the radio without any effort and when they're in their car the place where most people listen To audio nowadays outside of you know cities where people do it in commutes They just turn on the radio and they just listen to.

147
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,348
Speaker 0: they don't have to like synchronize anything prepare anything.

148
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,151
Speaker 0: hit the button It's there.

149
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:32,650
Speaker 0: they listen to something right they want to listen to something but most people hate the radio.

150
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,310
Speaker 0: People complain about it all the time.

151
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,734
Speaker 1: There's ads and shit.

152
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:40,750
Speaker 0: if they could just like a bad reception to their internet radio or their internet audio.

153
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,158
Speaker 1: Well, this is why satellite radio exists right.

154
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,329
Speaker 1: satellite radio doesn't have a lot of the bad reception problems.

155
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:46,690
Speaker 1: that what?

156
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:50,785
Speaker 1: FM am has right and it has a billion stations.

157
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:55,770
Speaker 1: so you can just pay and is Relatively a lot less commercials, you know, you have to pay a fee for it.

158
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,604
Speaker 1: But you know, you basically have a satellite radio.

159
00:10:58,644 --> 00:10:59,930
Speaker 1: you say I listen to blues music.

160
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,217
Speaker 1: There's like three blues stations.

161
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:01,760
Speaker 1: you pick one.

162
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,750
Speaker 1: blues music just starts coming at the same time.

163
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,763
Speaker 0: It's still not enough for the geeks because it's not balkanized enough.

164
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:11,736
Speaker 0: I can't listen to the obscure weird music I like because it's not there.

165
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,787
Speaker 0: and still none of the podcast none of the time shifted.

166
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:15,750
Speaker 0: independent cool stuff.

167
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:18,133
Speaker 0: Look at this Podcasting.

168
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,380
Speaker 1: right as podcasting is right now.

169
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,266
Speaker 1: You're obviously all listening to a podcast.

170
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,143
Speaker 1: It's Fickle and difficult for normal people, right?

171
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,570
Speaker 1: They have to go to a website.

172
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,103
Speaker 1: They have to figure out RSS and subscribing.

173
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,390
Speaker 1: they have to figure out syncing.

174
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:38,539
Speaker 1: they have to manage the downloading and the deleting and the downloading again and the you know, The whole it's a thing to manage.

175
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:39,543
Speaker 1: It's a lot more work.

176
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,030
Speaker 1: You can't just go BAM, right?

177
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:48,074
Speaker 1: Imagine if for example, you had a satellite radio, right but instead of all the different numbered channels It was just.

178
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:53,442
Speaker 1: there was a geek nice channel and you went in the geek nice channel And then there's a list of every geek nights episode and you picked one.

179
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,789
Speaker 1: you push play and it just played.

180
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,160
Speaker 1: right that could be.

181
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:03,281
Speaker 1: there's no reason that technology is Doesn't exist today other than no company has bothered to make it.

182
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:10,550
Speaker 0: and without the cell phone and without the direct on demand Why do I need to tether my stupid iPhone which has multiple ways of getting data?

183
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:11,877
Speaker 0: Even if it's not just?

184
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,490
Speaker 0: you know, I'm out there and I listen to things streaming real-time.

185
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:17,479
Speaker 0: Why do I need to go to my computer to sync?

186
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,487
Speaker 0: Why can't I just subscribe on the iPhone?

187
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:20,250
Speaker 0: It has iTunes.

188
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:25,726
Speaker 1: There's no reason that any device with Wi-Fi or even Bluetooth, right?

189
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:31,470
Speaker 1: Even if it has Bluetooth I should be able to connect to my computer with Bluetooth to sync.

190
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,230
Speaker 1: Why do I have to plug the device into the computer?

191
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,481
Speaker 1: Right the Zune has to plug into the computer.

192
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,130
Speaker 1: everything has to plug into the computer.

193
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,814
Speaker 1: There's no reason for that.

194
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:49,325
Speaker 1: if I may if I was a company that made, you know, mp3 players or you know digital You know portable multimedia devices, there would be no cable.

195
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:50,630
Speaker 1: There would be a charging cable.

196
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:51,226
Speaker 1: That would be it.

197
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,989
Speaker 1: The cable would only charge and everything would be over the air on its own.

198
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,276
Speaker 1: now Think about what this does for a second.

199
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,222
Speaker 1: this technology that we're talking about here.

200
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:08,407
Speaker 1: Isn't just a convenient thing for Podcast listeners right to to be able to get a podcast say if they haven't been home in a few days?

201
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:16,150
Speaker 1: or you know They can get a new episode if suddenly the episode shows up while they're outside and they don't have a computer handy But they have their iPod ready.

202
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:17,193
Speaker 1: It is that.

203
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:27,381
Speaker 1: but what it really is what this technology really is is no matter where you are You have on-demand radio on-demand radio.

204
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,524
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

205
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,850
Speaker 1: I mean that's even better than satellite radio satellite radio.

206
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,859
Speaker 1: You have a hundred certain stations be it.

207
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,767
Speaker 1: I'll listen to what the station is playing right now.

208
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:51,905
Speaker 1: on-demand radio is listen to anything you want whenever you want at any time in any place and something that can subscribe and download and stream podcasts with Wi-Fi or cell phone is That now it's completely revolutionary.

209
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:52,710
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

210
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,810
Speaker 1: It would change the way people listen to everything and podcasts would suddenly explode all over the place.

211
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,539
Speaker 0: Someone made it before we go into the news.

212
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:15,422
Speaker 0: the other point that I need to make just in case you're not a hundred Percent aware of this, you know iTunes can do it and Apple very pointedly very on purpose disabled over the wireless Podcast to anything.

213
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,410
Speaker 1: well, they didn't disable it.

214
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,313
Speaker 1: They just this.

215
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:21,610
Speaker 1: the iPhone has all the hardware necessary to do this in it.

216
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,824
Speaker 1: It has Wi-Fi it has cell phone.

217
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:24,749
Speaker 1: It can play mp3s.

218
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,357
Speaker 1: Right it can.

219
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,809
Speaker 1: that people have made RSS readers for it.

220
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:29,739
Speaker 1: It can do it.

221
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:30,690
Speaker 1: this hardware.

222
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:40,063
Speaker 1: If the iPhone had no software and it was just a piece of hardware and you wrote all the software for it You can make it do that trivially up and also software.

223
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:41,066
Speaker 0: it runs iTunes.

224
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,010
Speaker 1: It does.

225
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:52,049
Speaker 1: It can download music from the iTunes music store right over the air But it can't download a podcast episode over the air.

226
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:54,675
Speaker 1: They just they just.

227
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:58,566
Speaker 1: this is the thing that Apple does all the time right?

228
00:14:58,847 --> 00:14:59,248
Speaker 1: is that?

229
00:14:59,709 --> 00:14:59,790
Speaker 1: see?

230
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,863
Speaker 1: This is why you know open-source people are so crazy.

231
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,510
Speaker 1: if I have a piece of hardware, right?

232
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,069
Speaker 1: Let's say I have a fork right I go to the store and I buy a fork.

233
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:14,416
Speaker 1: Well, I can eat spaghetti with the fork right I can eat bread with the fork I guess right.

234
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:16,890
Speaker 1: I can do all sorts of things of the fork.

235
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,039
Speaker 0: I mean pry a nail out of the wall if you really want to.

236
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,851
Speaker 1: I know a fork can do so many different things Right?

237
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,170
Speaker 1: anything that you can think of to do with a fork if you bought that fork.

238
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,630
Speaker 1: You can do it with that fork if you can think to do it, right?

239
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:34,257
Speaker 0: But Apple likes to attach a device where and they say you can use this for for anything you want Except spaghetti fuck spaghetti.

240
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:35,982
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's actually worse than that.

241
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,386
Speaker 1: What it is is here.

242
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:43,010
Speaker 1: You have bought the fork Here is the fork the fork can do nothing and here is software.

243
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,940
Speaker 1: This software allows this fork to do what things.

244
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,024
Speaker 1: one two and three.

245
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:52,649
Speaker 1: the fork cannot do anything else Except for one two and three because that is the only software we have made.

246
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,250
Speaker 1: I put that program the fork to do anything else except for these few specific things.

247
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:01,280
Speaker 0: I put that fork into some Unapproved spaghetti and the prongs just fall right off.

248
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,866
Speaker 1: and my well, it just doesn't even go.

249
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,355
Speaker 1: you try to put it in it It doesn't?

250
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:05,363
Speaker 1: it's impossible.

251
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:11,507
Speaker 1: prongs fall off The pork just flies back into the kitchen and goes in the drawer stabs your mom along the way.

252
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:19,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, right This is why people are so crazy with Linux, right Linux might be a little difficult for normal people or whatever And I get into that right now.

253
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:22,470
Speaker 1: The point is is do you have Linux on a piece of hardware?

254
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,954
Speaker 1: It's open source.

255
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:30,804
Speaker 1: if there is something that the hardware can do You can do it because the software lets you do it no matter what.

256
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:33,345
Speaker 0: to summarize now This is before we even get into the news.

257
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:39,650
Speaker 1: yet The iPhone and this is true not just with the iPod the iPhone but all Apple products.

258
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:51,738
Speaker 1: OS X does not let you do everything that a Computer hardware does running on is capable of but but in some for the specific news Apple pointedly does not allow you to do this.

259
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,147
Speaker 0: one thing that a lot of people would really like to do.

260
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,713
Speaker 0: that really couldn't hurt Apple in any way.

261
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,901
Speaker 1: Well, it's not that they don't allow you to do it.

262
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:08,404
Speaker 0: It's that they have not enabled you to do it yes, but the thing is they basically you can't do it and So what could someone else let you do it?

263
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,010
Speaker 0: Could you write something else to do it?

264
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:16,990
Speaker 1: So so, of course the App Store comes out right and it's not just us that have seen this obvious gaping hole.

265
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:20,190
Speaker 1: Everyone in the freaking podcasting universe is seen as gaping hole.

266
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,970
Speaker 0: This was like the first thing when Kotaku was like, oh my god iPhone there were like can't do podcast WTF mate?

267
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,499
Speaker 1: Well in gadget not Kotaku Kotaku doesn't care.

268
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,770
Speaker 1: All right, but pretty much everyone wants this.

269
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,116
Speaker 1: So of course the App Store.

270
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,548
Speaker 1: it was only a matter of time before someone did it.

271
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:46,405
Speaker 1: So someone did it and they submitted it to the I the App Store pretty much right away and It was rejected from the App Store on the grounds, right?

272
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:47,870
Speaker 1: And here's where we start getting in trouble.

273
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,350
Speaker 1: They made this app that basically does exactly what we said.

274
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:59,316
Speaker 1: you can just subscribe to podcast download them or stream them audio or video over the Wi-Fi and Over the cell phone network.

275
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,247
Speaker 1: just you know, wherever you have a connection to the iPhone.

276
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:02,749
Speaker 1: It's all good.

277
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:07,690
Speaker 1: All right, the only problem with it is because you know the way the apps on the iPhone work.

278
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:16,250
Speaker 1: It doesn't integrate with the iPod software on the iPhone So it's not like you can add the podcast to the iPod section.

279
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,599
Speaker 1: You can only play them, you know from within.

280
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:30,550
Speaker 1: the you know, the plate the app itself, you know Which is a little bit annoying but it doesn't matter because it's still great even you know, forgetting that small problem right now I'm gonna play the the naive optimistic person.

281
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:39,127
Speaker 0: So so here's here's here's my little roleplay Golly gee now I can listen to podcasts on my iPhone without having to synchronize it to my iTunes.

282
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:49,807
Speaker 1: hot damn Yeah, well, they rejected it from the App Store and the reason they said they rejected it from the App Store was because it duplicates the functionality of iTunes.

283
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,110
Speaker 0: now now now now now now now.

284
00:18:51,966 --> 00:19:01,470
Speaker 0: so Apple won't let me Synchronize podcasts over the air with their software and if someone writes software that does just that one thing.

285
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:03,881
Speaker 0: They say it competes with their own software.

286
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:04,745
Speaker 0: that doesn't do that.

287
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:05,810
Speaker 1: Here's the thing though, right?

288
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,129
Speaker 1: This is where it gets kind of crazy.

289
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,810
Speaker 1: First of all, it doesn't compete with their software because it doesn't duplicate anything.

290
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,290
Speaker 1: It adds functionality that iTunes doesn't and the iPhone don't have.

291
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:31,570
Speaker 1: Secondly, there are people out there making apps for the iPhone such as weather apps and calculator apps and all sorts of other apps That do just duplicate existing functionality of the iPhone and iTunes and don't do anything else.

292
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:34,040
Speaker 1: so those apps are allowed in.

293
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:35,807
Speaker 1: yet this one isn't.

294
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:40,523
Speaker 1: and The only thing is puzzling is why don't they want this technology?

295
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:45,625
Speaker 1: now this turn on competing, you know, they They're not friends with the satellite radio.

296
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:46,510
Speaker 1: What do they give a shit about?

297
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,330
Speaker 0: No, that's why this is such an important and interesting news because this tells us something.

298
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,169
Speaker 0: This tells us that there's something we don't know.

299
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,544
Speaker 0: There's some specific reason Apple does not want us to have this functionality.

300
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:02,136
Speaker 0: because I mean before I mean They could have had a bunch of internal reasons.

301
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:06,110
Speaker 0: I mean, you know dev teams are they might say well this feature blah blah blah.

302
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,261
Speaker 0: Let's just not bother with it.

303
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:11,787
Speaker 0: They could have a bunch of Semibs, but good enough reasons, you know, who cares?

304
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:20,147
Speaker 0: it's a company they whatever they want, but the fact that they didn't include it and then they very Specifically disallow this means that there's something.

305
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:27,510
Speaker 0: there's some Specific direct reason why Apple as a policy reason does not want us to get I to get podcasts over the air.

306
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:30,077
Speaker 1: And this is this is something that people want.

307
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:34,953
Speaker 1: millions like millions of people want this and people who don't even know they want it Yeah on it.

308
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:36,098
Speaker 0: So this doesn't exist.

309
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:36,882
Speaker 0: That's the question.

310
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:37,726
Speaker 0: What is it?

311
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:38,510
Speaker 0: What is the reason?

312
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:41,037
Speaker 0: Why does Apple not want this Apple?

313
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,584
Speaker 1: Why is no company just jumped on this?

314
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:49,998
Speaker 1: I mean, well the PSP Is too big I know but it's the zoo.

315
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:52,065
Speaker 1: and did this everyone would have Zunes.

316
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:53,830
Speaker 1: what the fuck is Microsoft smoking?

317
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,719
Speaker 0: But what's I mean, I'm really creative.

318
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,966
Speaker 1: creative makes a million every SanDisk.

319
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,150
Speaker 1: There's so many Samsung.

320
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:06,047
Speaker 1: someone do it good and this is why right this is what open source is all about.

321
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:13,639
Speaker 1: if the Hardware is the only thing that actually requires a big company and money and all this You know such with open source.

322
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,649
Speaker 1: if it can't be done and people want it to get done It gets done.

323
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,250
Speaker 1: No If they're you know.

324
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:28,661
Speaker 1: If somehow right instead of having like portable devices that were controlled by companies portable devices were like PCs or you just could put whatever operating system on there you wanted.

325
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,970
Speaker 1: all of them would do this every single one of them.

326
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,322
Speaker 0: It would be you know, but but still I like.

327
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:34,428
Speaker 0: I really I want to know.

328
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:36,185
Speaker 0: I'm curious What do you guys out there think like?

329
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,449
Speaker 0: Why what is it that I mean?

330
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,830
Speaker 0: Do they think it'll compete with them selling stuff in the iTunes to podcast?

331
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:54,688
Speaker 1: I mean if they were worried about podcasts actually like succeeding and somehow Nobody pays for any music or listens to any streaming radio or anything anymore.

332
00:21:54,768 --> 00:22:01,181
Speaker 1: ever, you know It kills satellite FM and iTunes store and everything and suddenly Podcasts are the only thing left.

333
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:06,080
Speaker 1: if they're worried about that Why do they even have podcasts and iTunes in the first place?

334
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,410
Speaker 0: maybe because they added it and then you know to get iTunes out There and then they kind of don't want it to get any further and they're just hoping it'll die quietly.

335
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,683
Speaker 1: Because you know if iTunes didn't have podcasting at all wouldn't use an iPod.

336
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,245
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

337
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:22,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I definitely wouldn't either I. I basically only use my iPod because it does podcasting better than anything else.

338
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,694
Speaker 1: And that's another thing right.

339
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,110
Speaker 1: even if no one else is gonna go for the wireless podcast go for the big score.

340
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:32,967
Speaker 1: Why don't you at least just do podcasts as well as iTunes does it?

341
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:33,689
Speaker 1: everyone else is?

342
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,434
Speaker 1: Podcasting it does.

343
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,358
Speaker 1: they do it like poop.

344
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,124
Speaker 1: It's like completely useless.

345
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:40,637
Speaker 0: even well part of that I think is just it's a catch-22.

346
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:49,750
Speaker 1: not even like not Applications like Amarok and and such and such don't do podcasting on their own, but that's really good as iTunes does.

347
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,466
Speaker 0: It's really obvious why that it's a catch-22.

348
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:57,630
Speaker 0: Not enough people listen to podcasts for anyone to care about doing that because not enough people isn't a podcast.

349
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,757
Speaker 0: There's no benefit to be had.

350
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:10,283
Speaker 0: but there's a difference between Apple saying it's not worth our effort to support this in any way and Apple saying we're going to pointedly You from doing this even when someone else did all the work for us.

351
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:11,910
Speaker 0: yeah, so the story doesn't end there.

352
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,633
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

353
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:13,716
Speaker 0: so that this is.

354
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,684
Speaker 0: this is where this is why we're talking about this.

355
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:20,852
Speaker 0: everyone get ready to raise a big finger in the sky alright, so Normally right.

356
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:27,069
Speaker 1: the only way to get software onto your iPhone is to either get it from the App Store or jailbreak right.

357
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:33,970
Speaker 1: well The people who made this podcasting software that was rejected from iTunes have come up with something better.

358
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:35,292
Speaker 1: Alright.

359
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:41,132
Speaker 1: basically what they've done is first of all you go to their website and watch a video of the software to be suitably Impressed.

360
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:44,104
Speaker 1: they're not geek nights listeners, but you know they listen to.

361
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:45,650
Speaker 1: you know all the all the podcasts.

362
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,527
Speaker 1: You know the tech ones like the twits and the buzz out loud and all those things right.

363
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:59,895
Speaker 1: anyway They have made their software Available to people who have not jailbroken their iPhones But not through the App Store.

364
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:03,287
Speaker 1: the way they've set it up as far as I can tell right is.

365
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:14,667
Speaker 1: you go to their website You give them her email address Then you give them the UD ID which is basically the unique Identifying number from your iPhone and they have instructions to tell you how to you know.

366
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:15,310
Speaker 1: give them the number.

367
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,876
Speaker 1: You give them the number.

368
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,470
Speaker 1: what it appears to me is they're taking this number putting it in there.

369
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:25,204
Speaker 1: You know I iPhone dev kit, or you know iPod touch dev kit or whatever.

370
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it has to be iPhone I'm not sure.

371
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:35,010
Speaker 1: and then They are using that to deliver the software to you via their dev kit it seems.

372
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:42,990
Speaker 1: So they're basically circumventing the App Store to get this app out there because they care about it that much.

373
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:48,030
Speaker 0: Okay, so one what this means is that Apple is going to sue the fuck out of them.

374
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,730
Speaker 1: So we're gonna see what happens here.

375
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,000
Speaker 1: But I totally I'm going for it all out.

376
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,150
Speaker 0: everyone out there jump on this now.

377
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:57,140
Speaker 0: The more of us have it the more damage we can do.

378
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,240
Speaker 0: yeah,

379
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:17,506
Speaker 1: of course you know people are speculating about you know Apple being able to remotely delete things and such and such and such But I I hope there's some sort of court action where we bring to light some sort of like you know industry Conspiracy or you know collusion to prevent a particular technology from coming into existence.

380
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:20,573
Speaker 1: that would be obviously Beneficial or something like.

381
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:27,061
Speaker 0: I mean it might be far-fetched to say that like the technology industry at large has some sort of consortium or conspiracy.

382
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:38,001
Speaker 0: yeah It is a little crazy But it is not at all crazy to say that Apple very specifically is trying to keep this under wraps And why I don't understand why they don't want to do it.

383
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:42,157
Speaker 1: if if Steve Jobs said enough I think about this Steve Jobs Just did his little announcement.

384
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:44,270
Speaker 1: He's like new nanos yada yada yada right?

385
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:48,302
Speaker 1: Imagine if his announcement instead was new nanos.

386
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:52,202
Speaker 1: by the way the nanos have Wi-Fi and by the way Over-the-air podcast.

387
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:53,069
Speaker 1: people would be going.

388
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:56,454
Speaker 1: Instead people are going.

389
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,420
Speaker 1: yeah boring you got nothing good.

390
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,503
Speaker 1: We didn't get new MacBooks.

391
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,970
Speaker 1: Fuck you Steve come back next time, right?

392
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,056
Speaker 1: It's so easy.

393
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:07,670
Speaker 1: It's like a pile of gold is sitting there, and no one's picking it up.

394
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,350
Speaker 1: But we can't pick it up because we don't make hardware.

395
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:19,083
Speaker 1: If I somehow got money from some like any investor at all I would just do this immediately, and I'd be immediately rich.

396
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:20,390
Speaker 1: It's a guaranteed hit.

397
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:21,817
Speaker 1: I don't even care.

398
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,068
Speaker 1: if no one has me do it someone else do it.

399
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:33,256
Speaker 0: good God Things of the day.

400
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:41,221
Speaker 0: so actually this is one of my favorite movies even though It's a terrible movie for from almost any perspective.

401
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:55,225
Speaker 0: It's full of one-liners bad special effects the plot is uh Hilarious and the thing is it's hilarious partly because it takes itself completely Seriously almost the whole way through this movie is the running man.

402
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:56,610
Speaker 1: what the running man is not terrible.

403
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,339
Speaker 1: What's wrong with the running man is awesome.

404
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,228
Speaker 0: that movie is terrible and all.

405
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:03,197
Speaker 1: no It's just awesome and a non-ironic fat.

406
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:04,601
Speaker 0: wait wait wait wait now terrible.

407
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:14,049
Speaker 0: Scott you realize that the word terrible and the word awesome Depending on what definition you use and what connotations you bring along have very similar meanings.

408
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,590
Speaker 0: I've been the terrible the awesome and powerful.

409
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:18,792
Speaker 1: Right.

410
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:23,790
Speaker 1: well it is awesome and the running man is a fine piece of cinema.

411
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,256
Speaker 0: Money big prizes.

412
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:32,604
Speaker 1: I could maybe I'd have to actually make a list.

413
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:46,569
Speaker 1: it might make my top 100 but maybe 200, but it's way up there, and you know cuz there's so many movies Good ones, but he says I'll be back, and he's totally back But not for like a half-hour.

414
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,635
Speaker 1: Anyway, I love the running man.

415
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:49,277
Speaker 1: It's great.

416
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:50,480
Speaker 0: It is a great movie.

417
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,130
Speaker 0: It is great awesome, and it's fantastic and not terrible.

418
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,463
Speaker 0: It is very much terrible.

419
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,626
Speaker 0: good Lee awesome and terrible.

420
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:01,038
Speaker 0: good Period it is goodly.

421
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:14,379
Speaker 0: now anyway what I have for you is the original theatrical Trailer to the running man, and let me tell you in the era before Thunderthroat movie trailers Really really sucked.

422
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,849
Speaker 1: does that mean they're gonna suck again?

423
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:16,995
Speaker 0: I don't know.

424
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:17,900
Speaker 0: because I don't.

425
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,282
Speaker 0: I don't know.

426
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,850
Speaker 0: I haven't seen any movie trailers in a while.

427
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,149
Speaker 0: I haven't gone to a theater.

428
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:26,797
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is well I see like a lot of independent film movie trailers But they're never like normal movie.

429
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:26,917
Speaker 0: Well.

430
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:27,983
Speaker 1: They don't hire Thunder through.

431
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:28,204
Speaker 1: well.

432
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:28,908
Speaker 1: No one's hired him.

433
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:32,559
Speaker 0: now Someday, we're gonna have the capability to just recreate his voice.

434
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,369
Speaker 1: perfectly well start smoking now, and you'll you'll get there.

435
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:38,270
Speaker 0: No, I'll probably just sound like this in about five minutes.

436
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:42,690
Speaker 1: No, that's what you're gonna sound like when you're 80 when that the mid-range in your 50s sound great.

437
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:51,890
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway because that's not enough of a thing of the day The bonus pack because they both have the same word in the title at least the same root word.

438
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,989
Speaker 0: I have the three minute long theatrical trailer to Logan's run.

439
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:02,429
Speaker 0: now If you think that movie trailers from the running man era are bad.

440
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:14,355
Speaker 0: Feast your eyes and ears upon the terribly good trailer To the running man, which is also a fantastically Awesomely terrible movie.

441
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:17,647
Speaker 1: I could go on a slight tangent about comics for a minute if you want.

442
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,921
Speaker 0: That's fine Okay, so check this out right.

443
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,620
Speaker 0: I'm checking at PAX Ken Levine.

444
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,470
Speaker 1: he was given the keynote.

445
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:30,799
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah He talked about how he was buying the Logan's run comic when he was a kid right and how it disappeared Because there was no internet.

446
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,770
Speaker 0: he had no way to know what happened to it, right?

447
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,719
Speaker 1: And of course it was canceled cuz no one's buying it.

448
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,690
Speaker 1: Well, I'm a fan.

449
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:51,396
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, they're not big on the superheroes obviously if you haven't listened to a Wednesday episode, but in Marvel Comics There's the Cosmics which are basically it's all the comics about what happens in space, you know It's not about Iron Man and Captain America.

450
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,646
Speaker 1: It's about the Silver Surfer and Galactus Thanatos, right?

451
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:59,250
Speaker 0: Right exactly Oh Thanos I don't read any of that underwear pervert crap, right?

452
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,230
Speaker 1: So there's a dude Adam Warlock in space and he's pretty fucking awesome.

453
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,474
Speaker 1: he's he's my man, right.

454
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:11,963
Speaker 1: and the thing is I've never read like the old old old Adam Warlock comics and Recently Marvel came out with this hardcover.

455
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,770
Speaker 1: That's like Annihilation classic.

456
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:15,415
Speaker 1: It's like it's basically.

457
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:21,278
Speaker 1: they took a bunch of classic space comics put them in a book and that and they sort of labeled them with the same label.

458
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:26,909
Speaker 1: that's on the new space comics and it's sort of like Hey read this to get some background information on the new space comics, right?

459
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,790
Speaker 1: And there's an Adam Warlock comic in there that I kind of want to read and there's some Rocket Raccoon and whatever.

460
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,892
Speaker 1: But Logan's run number six is in there Six.

461
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,955
Speaker 0: Yeah that far.

462
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:41,589
Speaker 1: I think there must be something in Logan's run number six that ties it into the.

463
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:45,200
Speaker 1: You know Marvel something there.

464
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,204
Speaker 0: There can't be.

465
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,469
Speaker 1: there must be what?

466
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:52,165
Speaker 1: But I'm not gonna buy the book to find out because it's hardcover only.

467
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:56,068
Speaker 1: but if it's ever softcover I'm gonna buy it and find all this easier way on a Wednesday.

468
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,718
Speaker 0: Just ask people to tell you what the link is.

469
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,806
Speaker 0: someone out there is gonna own that thing.

470
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:01,870
Speaker 0: Maybe anyway.

471
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:03,777
Speaker 1: So check out this news.

472
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:04,360
Speaker 1: Thank you.

473
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,346
Speaker 1: thing of the day not news.

474
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:05,989
Speaker 1: I did my news.

475
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,230
Speaker 1: So it's you know, the US military has good and bad parts of it, you know.

476
00:31:12,531 --> 00:31:16,950
Speaker 1: But the best part of it according to Scott good parts made the internet bad parts killing people.

477
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,473
Speaker 1: Exactly is that the good parts are that we give it so much money In order to spend?

478
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:38,341
Speaker 1: because in the way government works is you get money from the government and that if you're a government Department or agency and if you don't spend all the money Let's say I get I own a lab a government lab and they give me a million dollars one year for my budget and I spend 800,000 they'll say oh, I guess you didn't need a million.

479
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:42,056
Speaker 1: Here's only 800,000 next year and you go fuck Right good.

480
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,570
Speaker 1: And then if you try to do something more well now you're SOL.

481
00:31:45,491 --> 00:32:01,602
Speaker 1: So the you know military gets lots and lots of money and since a lot of that money goes to defense contractors those defense contractors say hey if we want to make more money the only way for us to make more money because you don't have any customers but the government right is to tell the government to increase the military budget.

482
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:06,964
Speaker 1: and it goes in a cycle basically of the Military spends all its money on research and making shit.

483
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:13,210
Speaker 1: then the government You know has to increase that budget because the contractors make them and because they're the ones who get the money in the end.

484
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:30,366
Speaker 1: And so on and so forth and the result of this despite it being sort of bad in many ways you know with the military industrial complex is that many many awesome technologies are developed and Many of those, you know besides, you know, the ones that are pretty much only military use like space death lasers

485
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:30,927
Speaker 0: are

486
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:31,910
Speaker 1: used for.

487
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:39,510
Speaker 1: You know civilian things later on like the internet which is meant for one thing but is now meant for me talking to you right now.

488
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:56,206
Speaker 1: So one thing military has developed right is basically little you know Unmanned like like flying little airplane guys, right so That was some eloquence right that was.

489
00:32:56,226 --> 00:33:03,130
Speaker 1: I mean Spy drone basically like a robot spy plane, but like a big spy plane like a little one that you could hold.

490
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,738
Speaker 0: But yes, I would use the word drone.

491
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not as small as like a paper airplane.

492
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,644
Speaker 1: It's like about a you know meter wide or so, maybe like that.

493
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:11,554
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell, you know It's pretty big.

494
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:14,310
Speaker 1: you pick it up and you can throw it right, but it's it's big.

495
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:21,486
Speaker 1: It's like as wide as you know a person or wider than a person Right and you throw it and then it flies to its pre-programmed destination.

496
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:22,309
Speaker 1: It's got like a GPS.

497
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:27,890
Speaker 1: It's got little motors to control the rudders and such, you know, it's got a motor to keep it going.

498
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,493
Speaker 1: You know a little propeller whatever it is in the back and you know You can.

499
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:43,390
Speaker 1: you could put like a camera on one of these throw it Program it to fly over the enemy base take a bunch of pictures It comes back with the pictures or transmits the pictures to you over the air or something like that, right?

500
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,985
Speaker 1: it's a military technology and You know, we try to think of what use could this technology have for the civilians.

501
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:57,570
Speaker 1: and you think well I guess you know, you could use it for fun right like use an RC helicopter for fun, right?

502
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,993
Speaker 1: but what you know.

503
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:06,990
Speaker 1: or you could use it for sort of mundane things like spy in your neighbor or Follow your kids around if you're remote control it or something like that, right?

504
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:12,286
Speaker 1: But they have found perhaps the best use of this technology for civilian purposes.

505
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:13,449
Speaker 0: What Scott could it be?

506
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,649
Speaker 1: Do you know what it is now?

507
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:22,094
Speaker 1: so basically what they did is they slapped two red crosses on the bottom of it, right and in Africa.

508
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:33,509
Speaker 1: what they do with these now, or at least what some people are doing with these is they go out and they get like You know some blood samples and then they throw it and then it goes to the lab.

509
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,592
Speaker 0: Brilliant, right?

510
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,056
Speaker 1: It does more than that, right?

511
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:41,409
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm in the jungle and I got bit by the poison spider.

512
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:49,114
Speaker 1: I make a phone call they attach the antidote to the plane and they throw it and it comes to me with the anecdotes How does it know where you are?

513
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,284
Speaker 1: They know basically they know where you are because you have a GPS.

514
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:57,819
Speaker 1: they program the GPS cord Flies itself like you tell it where to go.

515
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:00,788
Speaker 1: you throw it and it gets there the vast majority of the time.

516
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,709
Speaker 1: it can go Against winds that are like 40 kilometers an hour and get there.

517
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:09,110
Speaker 0: I can think of another thing to use this for right totally awesome note passing.

518
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:11,556
Speaker 1: Well, yeah Yeah, but you know you could.

519
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:15,250
Speaker 1: basically I think they said it can carry 500 grams or something like that.

520
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,138
Speaker 1: So you can carry a lot of shit this thing.

521
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:22,130
Speaker 0: I can think of another use for it suddenly, but awesome drug dealing.

522
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:30,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna paint mine black You know throw it at night.

523
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:31,561
Speaker 0: I realized this.

524
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,485
Speaker 0: that's gonna be like.

525
00:35:32,545 --> 00:35:33,930
Speaker 0: that's not that far from the future.

526
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:36,118
Speaker 0: No, it's not that far from the future at all.

527
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:36,901
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

528
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:39,370
Speaker 0: that's like the best way to deal drugs and not get caught.

529
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:42,155
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh, right You can just throw these right.

530
00:35:42,336 --> 00:35:48,094
Speaker 1: you get Western Union's fuck cuz all the people if they want to send their money back Right over the face.

531
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:52,590
Speaker 0: already a big problem where people are smuggling cell phones and drugs and things into prisons.

532
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:57,795
Speaker 0: My shooting have this thing like shooting model rockets over the walls Which is trivial to do.

533
00:35:57,815 --> 00:36:04,002
Speaker 0: I can shoot a model rocket into the downstate correctional facility From my window if I want to do.

534
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:04,767
Speaker 0: it's right there.

535
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:11,247
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah, these are getting pretty good with these things and I'd like I'd like to have one.

536
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:12,632
Speaker 1: that'd be pretty cool I think.

537
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:13,555
Speaker 0: how much are they?

538
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:14,499
Speaker 0: I don't know.

539
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,021
Speaker 0: just buy it.

540
00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:16,046
Speaker 1: I don't think it's a thing for sale.

541
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,859
Speaker 1: It's like a military technology here.

542
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:20,729
Speaker 1: You're not gonna have a hard time getting one someday.

543
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:25,042
Speaker 1: I'll get one someday someday, but right now it's.

544
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:25,563
Speaker 1: it's just cool.

545
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,870
Speaker 1: and there's a video and there's an article on new scientist.

546
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:28,633
Speaker 1: That's it.

547
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:32,546
Speaker 0: So I realized we've never really talked.

548
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,670
Speaker 1: I was the one who realized it.

549
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:39,274
Speaker 0: Well, we realized we've never really talked about this and it came up in a somewhat unrelated conversation.

550
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:40,119
Speaker 1: that's I sort of.

551
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:47,997
Speaker 1: I was thought up an idea and Simultaneously thinking up the idea realized we hadn't talked about what the topic of yeah I was like, what if we did this?

552
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,726
Speaker 0: and I was like ipv6 already does that?

553
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:52,441
Speaker 1: well No, I was saying what if we did this with ipv6?

554
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,024
Speaker 1: will it work?

555
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,069
Speaker 1: That's what I said.

556
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is the idea.

557
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:58,688
Speaker 0: we're not gonna get into the idea, but basically we haven't talked about ipv6.

558
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,315
Speaker 1: No, we haven't.

559
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:00,878
Speaker 0: Of course.

560
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,890
Speaker 0: It's kind of moot because ipv6 is Not moving quickly in at least as far as any of you would ever be concerned.

561
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:11,725
Speaker 1: No Basically people who don't realize this right right now.

562
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:13,933
Speaker 1: people talk about IP Addresses and such.

563
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:20,430
Speaker 1: the internet and all your home networks pretty much unless you know and everything, you know about the internet is ipv4.

564
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:22,515
Speaker 1: Everything is ipv4.

565
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,842
Speaker 1: I bet you didn't even know.

566
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:29,972
Speaker 0: there was a one two and three, you know 127.0.0.1 IP addresses IP Version.

567
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:34,843
Speaker 1: for yeah, that is it's the fourth version of the IP internet protocol.

568
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,329
Speaker 0: now before anyone says so what's ipv5?

569
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,951
Speaker 0: It's something unrelated involving streaming Don't?

570
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,004
Speaker 0: it's the same reason why all the 802.11 some things are completely different things.

571
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:44,545
Speaker 0: There's no rhyme.

572
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:47,393
Speaker 1: It's like why was there a Bg?

573
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:48,680
Speaker 1: what happened to CDE?

574
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,545
Speaker 0: and they're all there.

575
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:50,430
Speaker 0: you can look up the list.

576
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,197
Speaker 0: You don't care about what any of them are.

577
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:55,472
Speaker 1: believe the only ones that are important to you are the ones that you see letters for.

578
00:37:55,512 --> 00:38:01,313
Speaker 1: you know H I J K LM are not important to you and is a Wasn't too important.

579
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,437
Speaker 1: Well, it's.

580
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:05,870
Speaker 1: it's a little bit a little more important than any of those other letters besides BG and N.

581
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:12,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, but 802.11 not 802.11. god ipv5 basically pretend it doesn't exist ipv6.

582
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:13,630
Speaker 0: now the deal is pretty simple.

583
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:28,409
Speaker 0: ipv4 and what we use as IP addresses was conceived and put together a long time ago when the world was very different and when when the government still owned the internet and things were broken up into classes and routing was pretty simple.

584
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:33,909
Speaker 0: and there are a lot more devices than anyone ever expected or intended on the internet.

585
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:44,748
Speaker 0: and The only reason we're still able to use ipv4 is by Continually hacking it together and making little changes and netting and cider.

586
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:52,150
Speaker 1: and yeah Basically ipv4 on its own is not capable of handling the internet as it is today.

587
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,464
Speaker 1: In order to make the internet work.

588
00:38:54,726 --> 00:39:04,879
Speaker 1: We have somehow Miraculously, I don't know how it happened I'm amazed that it works every day built all these other technologies on top of Ipv4 to make it work.

589
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,928
Speaker 1: We've made crazy routers Unbelievably crazy routers that shouldn't have to be made but they were made and now they need.

590
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:12,390
Speaker 1: we need them.

591
00:39:12,631 --> 00:39:15,210
Speaker 1: We've made NAT which is something we never would have needed.

592
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:22,330
Speaker 1: Well net net and pad that has some uses other than that But really we wouldn't need net if ipv4 wasn't poop.

593
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:30,050
Speaker 0: However, the thing is a lot of interesting things have come out of this like for example because everyone is using well Technically, you know someone says they have a net router.

594
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:45,870
Speaker 0: No, you have a pat router because it's port address translation, but I digress That that like the proliferation of that sort of network design for consumers has actually gone a long way to Protecting you from the terrible secret of space aka the real internet.

595
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:55,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, and ipv4 the biggest problem with it long run problem Is that even with NAT right you will run out of addresses?

596
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:05,106
Speaker 1: Eventually, I mean the biggest address you can have is 255 285 285 285 and that's not a lot of the addresses You can't even use because they don't you know, they're not real addresses.

597
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:05,990
Speaker 1: They're special for something.

598
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,943
Speaker 0: Here's the thing any sort of hierarchical system like that kind of like phone numbers.

599
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,119
Speaker 0: when they originally conceived and area codes They were used in an era.

600
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,276
Speaker 0: I mean there were no cell phones There was no phone number portability.

601
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:27,299
Speaker 0: phone numbers to a large degree, you know area codes and all those different like parts of a phone number Denoted geographical areas for purposes of routing phone calls.

602
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,880
Speaker 0: and that became increasingly useless with things like cell phones and routing got really complicated.

603
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:51,270
Speaker 0: and actually one of the biggest failings of ipv4 is that Routing became incredibly complex because we wanted you know We wanted to split up the way networks were originally designated and the hierarchy went all to shit And they used to attach right the numbers to the physical world.

604
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,030
Speaker 1: So they would say oh your number is you know this well that means it's in New York somewhere.

605
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:09,941
Speaker 1: So now we know to route it over this cable and it was basically by having that that that tie-in Between the structure of the numbers and the structure of the real world Setting up routing was really easy and simple.

606
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,507
Speaker 1: It was just sort of like oh this goes that way.

607
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:12,310
Speaker 1: this goes that way.

608
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:13,854
Speaker 1: You do anything complex.

609
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:20,695
Speaker 0: you could simplify routes like you knew all the 129 dot anythings are gonna be in that direction From all these different locations.

610
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:24,630
Speaker 0: you even care what's actually over there or where specifically it is.

611
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,930
Speaker 0: You just know that way that way that way.

612
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,630
Speaker 1: So if you had like three different, you know network connections coming out of your router.

613
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,670
Speaker 1: I go and you know one goes west one goes east one goes north.

614
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:38,267
Speaker 1: You pretty much say this third of the IP addresses go left this third go right this third go north.

615
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,725
Speaker 1: all done Right easy easy as pie.

616
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:43,358
Speaker 0: now, of course We're grossly oversimplifying but of

617
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:43,980
Speaker 1: course like

618
00:41:44,281 --> 00:42:07,590
Speaker 0: one example of how we've really hacked this together is It wasn't that long ago that cider CID our classless inner domain routing was introduced and this was basically To break up the very rigid structure of IP addresses in order to allow us to take advantage of addresses that existed That due to the structure of the way we used IP addresses couldn't actually be used.

619
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:19,090
Speaker 0: It's kind of like if you built a house but in order to support the house you had to build this big column in the middle of the house and Inside of that column which was a big square was void space that could not be accept.

620
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:22,390
Speaker 0: It was in no way accessible to people just because of the way you built the house.

621
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:27,050
Speaker 0: You know, there was like it was used for pipes and stuff, but now you really need that extra space.

622
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:38,610
Speaker 0: So you tore down all those walls and basically rebuilt the inside of the house with this very Complex and incredibly difficult to understand system just to use that extra space that was there anyway, but inaccessible.

623
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:43,089
Speaker 0: but as a result you lost a lot of the advantages of the original structural design.

624
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:50,583
Speaker 0: and I'm not gonna explain how cider works But for anyone who has a little like just enough knowledge to be dangerous.

625
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:52,810
Speaker 0: Here's the simplest way I can explain it.

626
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,141
Speaker 0: I hope you can figure out the rest.

627
00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:07,040
Speaker 0: a Class C address is the old way of talking about something, you know a subnet mask 255 255 255 dot zero Nowadays, that's a slash 24.

628
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,687
Speaker 0: I hope you can figure out the rest from there.

629
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:23,750
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so we had this crazy system that's way old and antiquated But somehow we have put things on top of it and modified it and come up with different things To make it still work for modern purposes.

630
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,355
Speaker 1: But it's also

631
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:39,690
Speaker 0: partly due to the unintended, you know Part of the reason we thought we'd run out of addresses is that as more and more people got Devices that were capable of going online, you know every cell phone every computer every chair every every refrigerator gets online You suddenly run out of public IP addresses.

632
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:52,658
Speaker 0: but it's turned out that that that future never really came to be and all the devices that are becoming online are largely passive or hidden or They're not really content publishers to the world.

633
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:56,830
Speaker 0: They're content publishers to local subnets or their content receivers.

634
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:00,650
Speaker 0: I mean, no one's hosting a web page on their cell phone, right?

635
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:06,363
Speaker 1: We've been able to use Nat slash Pat to avoid that problem.

636
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,449
Speaker 1: pretty much come almost completely.

637
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:14,230
Speaker 1: but one day That problem will happen and we will run out of IP addresses.

638
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,624
Speaker 1: He's gonna be really slow a lot slower than we thought it was gonna be years ago.

639
00:44:17,664 --> 00:44:18,427
Speaker 1: We years ago.

640
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:19,793
Speaker 1: We were like, oh shit We're gonna run out.

641
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:21,198
Speaker 0: I mean dude in high school.

642
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:25,234
Speaker 0: I remember saying oh man, we need IP v6 We're fucked right.

643
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:27,383
Speaker 1: and then you know, Nat sort of saved the day.

644
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:34,616
Speaker 1: and people realized though We're not gonna run out but we are going to run out in a while 15 years.

645
00:44:34,696 --> 00:44:36,400
Speaker 0: really it's cider that saved the day.

646
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,030
Speaker 1: But anyway that too those two things combined have saved the day regardless.

647
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:53,648
Speaker 1: IP v6 is the long-term solution and it has many other Advantages and the really the only disadvantage of IP v6 is that everyone has to switch and it's a pain in the

648
00:44:53,809 --> 00:45:02,234
Speaker 0: ass Yeah, but at the same time there are a lot of ways to make that transition and there is actually a lot of infrastructure that None of you can see.

649
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:04,845
Speaker 0: that is IP v6 compatible.

650
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:05,990
Speaker 0: IP v6 works.

651
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:10,128
Speaker 0: There are ways to tunnel IP v4 and IP v6 through each other also IP v6.

652
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:25,545
Speaker 0: The first thing you'll notice about IP v6 right is that the IP addresses aren't easy to remember which in a way is good because IP addresses are Really this kind of back end that you shouldn't need to know anymore kind of.

653
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:27,050
Speaker 0: it's a bad analogy.

654
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,568
Speaker 0: But in the old days, I knew someone's phone number and if I didn't I looked it up.

655
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:36,790
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I kind of cashed my knowledge of the phone number in my cell phone.

656
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:45,393
Speaker 0: I don't know a single per human beings phone number in the world now except my own and my cell phone My own.

657
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:48,705
Speaker 0: well, I know my own because I memorized it a long time ago.

658
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,869
Speaker 1: I'm still memorizing my.

659
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:54,199
Speaker 1: Anyway, so IP v4 addresses.

660
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:57,589
Speaker 1: you've seen IP addresses like 192 dot something that's on the Sun, right?

661
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:58,751
Speaker 1: IP v6.

662
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,576
Speaker 1: here's an example IP v6.

663
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:06,090
Speaker 0: It is eight groups of four digit hexadecimal numbers, right?

664
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:15,100
Speaker 1: So it's 32 symbols and the symbols could be anything between 0 and F. So 0 1 to the rise of 89 ABC de hexadecimal.

665
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:33,689
Speaker 1: so I could have f f1 a b7 for a One one one one one four one one, you know It could be 32 F's and there's a colon in between every set of four F. So four F's colon four F's colon four F's colon and then one two, three, four five more sets of four F's.

666
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:41,557
Speaker 0: Granted that that's a. I mean the the colons and things are just to make it easier to remember and write kind of like the dots In IP v4 exactly.

667
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,409
Speaker 1: So if you think about that, right how many?

668
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,494
Speaker 1: Impossible?

669
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:50,655
Speaker 1: how if we used every IP v4 address in the world How many addresses?

670
00:46:50,755 --> 00:46:55,810
Speaker 0: would that be far fewer than you think because most of them are useless, right?

671
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,330
Speaker 1: Well, even if all of them were useful, right?

672
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,536
Speaker 1: That's 255 times 255 times 285 times 285, right?

673
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,439
Speaker 1: That's let's see.

674
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:10,763
Speaker 0: I'm surprised you didn't do this calculation ahead of time and or have it memorized.

675
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:13,856
Speaker 1: I think it's like 4.2 billion Addresses.

676
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,889
Speaker 0: maybe there's a much simpler way to put it.

677
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,013
Speaker 0: IP v4 is 32-bit.

678
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:17,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's 32 bits.

679
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:23,573
Speaker 0: IP v6 is 128 bits.

680
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:33,469
Speaker 0: that is more IP addresses than like the entire current population of the world Per square meter of surface area of the world with plenty to spare.

681
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:35,966
Speaker 1: Exactly, you could if we used IP v6.

682
00:47:36,871 --> 00:47:39,683
Speaker 1: That means you could have right.

683
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:49,219
Speaker 1: billions of IP addresses billions of billions of IP addresses and billions in one square inch of the surface of the earth.

684
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:59,318
Speaker 1: in other words if One day we want to have like nanobots and we want every single nanobot to have its own IP address IP v6 can do that with no problem.

685
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,221
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, whatever.

686
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:01,725
Speaker 1: We got IP address to spare.

687
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:02,287
Speaker 1: go nuts.

688
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:02,828
Speaker 1: We're good.

689
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:09,030
Speaker 0: now It's actually like the ramifications of such a large address space go far beyond.

690
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:11,158
Speaker 0: OMG will never run out of IP addresses.

691
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:29,762
Speaker 0: and I kind of want to spend a little bit of time just talking about you know This is kind of the the primer to think about what you can do when given more Resources than you need because usually as computer scientists or IT people We're always in the situation of do as much as you can with as little as possible.

692
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:31,426
Speaker 0: Here's 4k of RAM.

693
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:32,610
Speaker 0: write that program.

694
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:33,922
Speaker 0: Here's 5 bucks.

695
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:34,729
Speaker 0: make that network.

696
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:38,802
Speaker 0: IP v6 is the equivalent of here's a billion dollars.

697
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:40,207
Speaker 0: connect those two computers together.

698
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:43,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Now now think about this.

699
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:49,395
Speaker 0: Currently, you know, we have I have a computer and I don't want to you know program the IP address every time I use it.

700
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:52,659
Speaker 0: We use something called DHCP Dynamic host configuration protocol.

701
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:58,962
Speaker 0: it basically is the thing where I turn on my computer It gets an IP address from another source from my links is right.

702
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:02,696
Speaker 1: when you when you have a computer with IP v4 There's two things you can do.

703
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:17,036
Speaker 1: you can either type into that computer with your hands This is your IP address computer or you can have a server on the network And when the computer turns on it'll talk to that server on the network and say hey server on the network What's my IP address?

704
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:18,062
Speaker 1: and the server will tell it.

705
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:22,490
Speaker 1: or it'll say no fuck you You're not getting one right, but you have to set up this server.

706
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:22,792
Speaker 1: You have to.

707
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:28,221
Speaker 1: actually can someone somewhere your network administrator Had set up the server with their own hand?

708
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:30,129
Speaker 0: or if you have a links as routers does it?

709
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:30,430
Speaker 0: and people?

710
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,541
Speaker 1: Your links is router?

711
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:32,349
Speaker 1: does it on its own?

712
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,313
Speaker 1: But it's it's.

713
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:38,050
Speaker 1: it's serving somebody with their hands had to make the IP addresses happen.

714
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:40,570
Speaker 0: Now the thing is or you can just do it all yourself.

715
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:49,242
Speaker 0: But there is a third way and this has been done in IP v4 And I'm not going to talk about all the different ways to do it But Microsoft actually did it better than most people.

716
00:49:49,262 --> 00:49:51,030
Speaker 1: you ever heard of the other quickly.

717
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,876
Speaker 0: But no it works better than most.

718
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:59,719
Speaker 0: the auto configuration you ever noticed how if you don't get an address and you have a Microsoft Windows PC sometimes you'll get like an address.

719
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:00,883
Speaker 0: That's all weird.

720
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:05,137
Speaker 0: It's like 60 something dot something and basically what it does.

721
00:50:05,157 --> 00:50:07,087
Speaker 0: and I'm simplifying obviously.

722
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:22,539
Speaker 0: but Windows computers if they're set up this way if they can't get an IP address, and they don't have one configured will pick in a certain range that Microsoft happens to own a random IP address paying the local network to see if anyone has that address.

723
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,187
Speaker 0: and if no one does they'll take it for themselves.

724
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:30,830
Speaker 0: and a bunch of Windows computer computers can kind of make their own ad hoc network.

725
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:33,970
Speaker 0: Yeah on their own with very little if any interaction.

726
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,150
Speaker 1: I mean it rare it's rarely useful.

727
00:50:36,692 --> 00:50:47,250
Speaker 1: But on occasions if you just take a bunch of Windows PCs and you know plug them all into a switch Right they can sort of start networking and you know it is like a Windows for workgroups.

728
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:49,501
Speaker 1: You know sort of fallback kind of thing is there.

729
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:56,350
Speaker 1: they can start connecting to each other They'll sort of come up with addresses on their own and some things will work that you can talk to each other.

730
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:59,385
Speaker 0: Now before we talk about how what you can do with ipv6.

731
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:00,390
Speaker 0: that's cool with this.

732
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:08,180
Speaker 0: I want to talk about the fact that because there are so many IP addresses There was a lot of really interesting structure built into ipv4.

733
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,146
Speaker 0: I mean there's the whole multicast group.

734
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,490
Speaker 0: There's the experimental group.

735
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:19,469
Speaker 0: There's all like the broadcast and all these kind of different things and hierarchies and kind of built in structure That is inherent in the design.

736
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:24,748
Speaker 0: But when you've got so much extra space with ipv6 you can you have a lot more room to work.

737
00:51:24,868 --> 00:51:25,390
Speaker 0: as a result.

738
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:40,150
Speaker 0: you could Theoretically think of this what if you set aside in any given network a billion IP addresses just random ones and Any computer in that network can use some sort of semi random?

739
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,169
Speaker 0: Seeding mechanism to pick an address in that scope if it doesn't have another way to get one?

740
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:54,459
Speaker 0: Odds are it will be a unique address and basically you can have DHCP without a DHCP server And there's so much leeway that it'll just work.

741
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:01,100
Speaker 0: and you define you know ways to automatically find Routers and automatically say hey, I'm a new computer.

742
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,961
Speaker 0: Are there any routers and routers in your local network can say hey I'm a router now.

743
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:06,750
Speaker 0: I know you exist.

744
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:15,778
Speaker 1: Let's play in other words because there's so many IP addresses and the odds of anyone picking the same one as someone else are Effectively zero because there's just so many.

745
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:22,258
Speaker 1: you can just sort of have networks that configure themselves well Really without doing anything.

746
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:23,524
Speaker 1: you just plug computers in.

747
00:52:23,564 --> 00:52:24,730
Speaker 1: boom they're working their network.

748
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,735
Speaker 1: That's all good internet.

749
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,630
Speaker 1: Go you don't have to fiddle with your network settings.

750
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:30,690
Speaker 1: You know one has to set up the router.

751
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:34,445
Speaker 1: You know someone has to set the router But they don't have to set it up as much as they would.

752
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:34,706
Speaker 1: an ipv4.

753
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:42,329
Speaker 1: You know there's a lot less tinkering and you're gonna have a lot less problems where all my you know networking is not working.

754
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:43,573
Speaker 1: now It's not much gonna be.

755
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,857
Speaker 1: are you plugged in?

756
00:52:45,238 --> 00:52:46,322
Speaker 1: is your computer broken?

757
00:52:46,342 --> 00:52:47,947
Speaker 1: and those things are yes?

758
00:52:49,257 --> 00:52:53,221
Speaker 1: No Your computer is plugged in and it's not broken.

759
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:54,647
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna just work with ipv6.

760
00:52:55,551 --> 00:53:01,490
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the really interesting thing is that this idea like the root idea here is the future.

761
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,922
Speaker 0: This is the future of everything right here right now.

762
00:53:04,323 --> 00:53:15,046
Speaker 0: if you don't realize it this kind of non-deterministic Ad-hoc self configuration of multiple nodes is the future of all computing.

763
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:16,170
Speaker 0: This is the future of CPUs.

764
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:18,137
Speaker 0: This is the future of networks.

765
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:19,923
Speaker 0: This is the future of software.

766
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're talking about things like right now, right?

767
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,230
Speaker 1: Let's say me and rim have cell phones, and we're sitting in public space right we want our cell phones to talk to each other.

768
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:33,790
Speaker 1: Well, let's let's pretend that these are awesome open source cell phones with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and everything and the software is Linux.

769
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:35,289
Speaker 1: Okay, what do we have to do?

770
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:35,868
Speaker 1: Well we can.

771
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:37,517
Speaker 1: You can do an infrared link.

772
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:41,513
Speaker 1: or one person has to say host and the other person has to say connect and we have to Aim them at each other.

773
00:53:41,613 --> 00:53:47,254
Speaker 1: or you know someone has to say I'm making a Wi-Fi network and the other person says I'm joining your Wi-Fi network and the other.

774
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:54,605
Speaker 1: or you could you know and then the guy who's hosting the Wi-Fi network has to run like a DTP server and tell the other guy an IP address and a whole thing.

775
00:53:54,926 --> 00:54:01,045
Speaker 1: or if you're doing Bluetooth one guy has to be like Bluetooth discovery mode the other guy right with IPv6.

776
00:54:01,165 --> 00:54:03,629
Speaker 1: if you pretty much just like hey What's up click?

777
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,560
Speaker 0: IPv6 is not the thing that's going to cause that.

778
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:12,367
Speaker 0: I'm talking more about the root concept because IPv6 Still has a lot of limitations, and you know there's limitations.

779
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:17,050
Speaker 0: that pretty much Is that IPv6 is not going to make any of these things happen.

780
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:38,621
Speaker 0: IPv6 is just a very rudimentary very kind of initial and very explorative exploratory Exploration of these sorts of concepts, but the future on a core to not talk about the technological underlying layer Non-deterministic ad hoc networking and communication is the future.

781
00:54:39,162 --> 00:54:42,050
Speaker 0: and this non-deterministic is with this big space.

782
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:45,600
Speaker 0: IPv6 allows a very rudimentary form of this to happen.

783
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:47,485
Speaker 0: I mean another example of this.

784
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:48,950
Speaker 0: I mean this is not a new idea.

785
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,635
Speaker 0: Token ring was deterministic.

786
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:53,581
Speaker 0: you could calculate bandwidth perfectly.

787
00:54:53,721 --> 00:54:55,646
Speaker 0: everything was controlled.

788
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:57,712
Speaker 0: every network device was Intelligent.

789
00:54:58,134 --> 00:55:00,803
Speaker 0: every piece along the way was controlled deterministic.

790
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:02,389
Speaker 0: You know exactly what was happening.

791
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:08,066
Speaker 0: Ethernet basically just shot its crap all out all over the internet and all just kind of worked out.

792
00:55:08,086 --> 00:55:32,284
Speaker 0: if things ran into each other Everyone just said whoa backs off they wait a random amount of time before trying again and everything's kind of random and fuzzy and non-deterministic, but as Speeds got better and as you know technology got better these non-deterministic means always win out over the deterministic means of communication in the end and We're going to see a lot of cool things in these fronts in the future.

793
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:36,135
Speaker 0: IPv6 is one tiny Tiny tiny example of this.

794
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:39,805
Speaker 1: yeah, here's another another cool feature of IPv6 right?

795
00:55:39,905 --> 00:55:41,790
Speaker 1: is the the multicast anycast?

796
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,272
Speaker 1: Whatever.

797
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:46,488
Speaker 0: yes, there is multicast and IPv4, but let me let me explain to you what this means.

798
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:54,269
Speaker 1: all right IPv4 does have Multicast, but it doesn't really work super as you would want it to.

799
00:55:54,289 --> 00:56:01,389
Speaker 0: well It's partly experimental and you can like I we use it for a lot of things at our job and IBM We used it and like Cisco uses it a lot.

800
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,994
Speaker 0: But there are a lot of problems with IPv6 and it will with Multicast and IPv4.

801
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:09,180
Speaker 0: yeah, what IPv6 is done?

802
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,790
Speaker 0: because you know before there was you know broadcast unicast multicast.

803
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:29,035
Speaker 0: there is no such thing as broadcast in IPv6 because the idea of broadcast and broadcast domains and collision domains are Basically archaic nomenclatures that in modern networking Don't make sense.

804
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:30,458
Speaker 0: so as a result they got rid of that.

805
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:32,262
Speaker 0: there is just multicast.

806
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:48,282
Speaker 0: multicast is defined multicast is universal Multicast is broken up into to not use all the jargon multicast to my local network multicast to all the routers on my network Multicast to my broad segment multicast to my geographical area.

807
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:57,070
Speaker 0: all these kinds of defined multicast Addresses or multicast networks that allow for really really interesting things.

808
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:04,917
Speaker 0: Maybe not so much for you personally yet, but for large networks for configuration for organizations for backbones This is a killer app.

809
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:07,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about it right now.

810
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:08,290
Speaker 1: You have a computer.

811
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:11,561
Speaker 1: I want to send a video to rim.

812
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,190
Speaker 1: so I have to say I open up a connection directly to rim.

813
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:18,030
Speaker 1: You know even though it's packetized It's not like a telephone network where it's a solid connection.

814
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,100
Speaker 1: But I'm connected to rim and I send him stuff.

815
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,199
Speaker 1: You know to him only I want to send the video to Someone else at the same time.

816
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:26,942
Speaker 1: well now.

817
00:57:26,982 --> 00:57:28,650
Speaker 1: I have to use twice as much bandwidth.

818
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:33,685
Speaker 1: I'm sending the same video two times over the same wire to two different people.

819
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:39,550
Speaker 1: if 20 people want the video I'm sending the same video 20 times over one wire.

820
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:45,250
Speaker 1: And this is why sites go down because they're you know the million people come and say give me give me give me give me.

821
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:49,383
Speaker 1: And then their bandwidth fills up and the pipe that connects to their one computer, and then they're done.

822
00:57:50,486 --> 00:58:00,695
Speaker 1: if we actually had multicast with ipv6 Which is a lot more useful than the ipv4 one in that you could actually do other things with it besides You know network management.

823
00:58:00,716 --> 00:58:03,809
Speaker 1: It could actually be relied upon to do what you wanted to do.

824
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:20,496
Speaker 1: I could send out the video just once Over my wire and then he would go to the next router and the next router and it would only split up When there was actually people to split it up amongst you know it would go to one router and say all right everyone This is going to is still in that direction.

825
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:25,830
Speaker 1: Okay, and it only takes up one space worth of itself until it gets somewhere.

826
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:30,050
Speaker 1: Okay, some people who want to watch this video or to the left and some people want to watch it or to the right?

827
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:33,457
Speaker 1: So now we'll split it up But now it's only taking up to yet.

828
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:41,849
Speaker 1: at the other at the farthest end of the network there could be a hundred people Who want to watch that video, but we're only sending one copy of it over the network because it's a broadcast.

829
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:43,134
Speaker 1: now Make it there.

830
00:58:43,295 --> 00:58:45,504
Speaker 0: It's not really gonna work like that in the real world.

831
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:53,190
Speaker 0: I mean basically it is Primarily going to be used within individual networks as opposed to on the global network.

832
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,334
Speaker 0: I mean it's more for like the.

833
00:58:54,676 --> 00:59:21,569
Speaker 0: the uses people like out there will have you will have is that if it's more Understood more well implemented and just works better, and there's more space to use it There'll be a lot of software like say you want to watch a movie on your like you want to stream your anime fans up Or whatever in your local dorm room or your house You'll just it'll automatically stream with this to all the devices that want to see it on your local network Without going on all the links that don't need it and all sorts of fun stuff like that.

834
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about for right now, right?

835
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:29,510
Speaker 1: Let's say rim wants to watch a video that's on my computer right and then I want to watch the same video downstairs.

836
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:36,885
Speaker 1: So now my computer has to read this video and send it to two different computers and our network bandwidth in the house starts filling Up real quick and it gets slow.

837
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:48,176
Speaker 1: and Blair With if we had IPv6 and we had it set up properly with the new technologies It would be all good, and it would just send the video to both places But only send it once of course

838
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:51,730
Speaker 0: only with specialized software and only if we're both watching at the same time.

839
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:54,949
Speaker 0: Or we have some sort of very complex caching mechanism, but I digress.

840
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:59,010
Speaker 1: I mean Yeah, I get into the specifics, but here's a really good example of how to make everything awesome.

841
00:59:59,372 --> 01:00:02,550
Speaker 1: Let's say you want to play a game at a LAN party right?

842
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,786
Speaker 1: Instead you know instead of having the.

843
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:08,135
Speaker 1: you know The game server right.

844
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:16,070
Speaker 1: send the game state updates to having to manage sending the state updates to each individual player It'll just broadcast the game state.

845
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:20,745
Speaker 0: I'm well thing is you realize that most land like if you pick land instead of something else?

846
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:22,430
Speaker 0: it does that anyway really?

847
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:25,522
Speaker 1: I've never seen to do that unless you do the IPX BS.

848
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:27,450
Speaker 0: Well like steam and a lot of things do that.

849
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:34,884
Speaker 0: I mean if you just play low like most games, and you just click pick land it'll broadcast a whole bunch of information around.

850
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:35,969
Speaker 0: every game does it differently.

851
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:41,490
Speaker 0: and The other caveat here is that most game publishers probably won't care because most people play online.

852
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,420
Speaker 0: But you can do interesting stuff with this.

853
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,585
Speaker 0: the real interesting thing about ipv6 The real interesting thing along these lines is something called anycast.

854
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:51,869
Speaker 0: now the idea here is that?

855
01:00:52,872 --> 01:01:11,830
Speaker 0: You have an IP address or whatever a destination that exists wholly and completely in Multiple places and routers basically use the routing protocol updates They get from their neighbors to route your requests and its responses from the nearest node to you.

856
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,301
Speaker 0: So say I I am valve and I have steam and I want to.

857
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:17,809
Speaker 0: I want to have you download software from me.

858
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:28,562
Speaker 0: I have multiple steam distribution servers in multiple geographical locations And if you connect to a steam server you connect to an anycast address.

859
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,510
Speaker 0: that is just basically the steam download server.

860
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:32,673
Speaker 0: Routers.

861
01:01:32,894 --> 01:01:41,849
Speaker 0: take your request to the nearest and nearest is a logical thing not a physical thing Server and you just get the updates from there, but it's all seamless to you.

862
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,404
Speaker 0: You don't need to know or care.

863
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:51,030
Speaker 0: in fact There is theoretically no way for the end-user to know that an address is an anycast address as opposed to a unicast address.

864
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:52,334
Speaker 1: His isn't it right?

865
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:57,047
Speaker 1: right now things like this are actually happening, but they're doing it a very hackneyed way.

866
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:59,175
Speaker 1: for example Look at Google right.

867
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:01,063
Speaker 1: try to ping google.com.

868
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,610
Speaker 1: It's gonna show up as an IP address.

869
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:05,562
Speaker 1: Alright, maybe if you ping Google from somewhere else.

870
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:07,690
Speaker 1: You'll actually see it's a different IP address.

871
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:13,029
Speaker 1: What's happening there is Google uses Akamai and I could talk about Akamai as a company that basically does this thing.

872
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:17,290
Speaker 1: and The way it works is you ask the DNS server?

873
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,741
Speaker 1: Hey, what IP address is google.com?

874
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:21,710
Speaker 1: and depending on many factors?

875
01:02:22,212 --> 01:02:25,989
Speaker 1: It'll tell you a different IP address to match up the name.

876
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:34,758
Speaker 1: What with ipv6 the difference is instead of asking for google.com and getting a different answer all the time You ask for google.com.

877
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:37,070
Speaker 1: if it's ipv6 you're always gonna get the same answer.

878
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:40,370
Speaker 1: But and that number will be the same for everyone.

879
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:48,361
Speaker 1: but that number is actually just sort of a nickname or Alias for a bunch of other numbers that are where the servers really are.

880
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:51,149
Speaker 1: and it decides on the routing layer a lower layer.

881
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:52,708
Speaker 1: It does this on its own.

882
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:56,802
Speaker 1: Basically, the Akamai company will go out of business if ipv6 comes into play.

883
01:02:56,882 --> 01:02:59,069
Speaker 0: No, they won't because you don't think so.

884
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:10,210
Speaker 0: well, the thing is that the whole reason this is secure is the same reason the internet kind of works is that Large networks and like the top the higher tier providers peer with each other.

885
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,261
Speaker 0: They trust each other and this happens at a low level protocol layer to where you.

886
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:17,750
Speaker 0: you trust the routes you get the route updates.

887
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:34,170
Speaker 0: the you know routes are the things that tell packets where to go basically and you know you need to get your routing information from your neighbors and from other people out on the word on the world and they get their routing information from other people and You have to choose who to trust and you not to trust.

888
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:57,470
Speaker 0: So for any cast to work the big-name players and the people who really matter on the internet have to trust the routes that are being propagated and any cast will Probably for a long time only really be available to very big players Which is for the best because otherwise it is the biggest freaking security hole in the world.

889
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:12,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but I mean if we've solved all these problems on top of I know we have Only solved them because If we've solved other problems on top of IPv4 I'm sure we could solve you know, the problems in IPv6 just disease.

890
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:20,229
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah What I'm saying is that things like anycast a lot of these cool functionality works because of the same reason the internet works.

891
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:31,109
Speaker 0: now Very very large networks trust each other on a very specific Technological level and you do not have access to that trust and no one is going to trust you.

892
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,475
Speaker 1: No, it's trusting you at all.

893
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:39,370
Speaker 0: truck like trust on the internet is pretty much the most important commodity at a network level.

894
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:47,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, so a lot of the things you think you can do that are all cool You cannot do because no one will trust you except your friends.

895
01:04:48,063 --> 01:04:50,110
Speaker 1: That's the simplest way you can do them with your friends.

896
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:51,590
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, most definitely.

897
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:53,065
Speaker 1: But in fact you can do with your friends.

898
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:56,664
Speaker 1: right now I pb6 is just your computer probably has everything it needs.

899
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:57,889
Speaker 1: You just need to set it up.

900
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:03,760
Speaker 1: You can set up a little LAN with IPv6 real easily Yes, but getting your IPv6 onto the real IPv6.

901
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,486
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into this much more difficult.

902
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,506
Speaker 0: Just google for IPv6 You'll find how-tos.

903
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:14,337
Speaker 0: I mean I actually used to have a whole ton of addresses on the six bone back in the day because you know We went to our IT.

904
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,050
Speaker 0: We're in access to internet too and all those sorts of fun things.

905
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:26,890
Speaker 0: So I requested a ton of IPv6 addresses and my own IPv6 network on the six bone Because I was in a class where I had to do a big thesis on IPv6 and interoperability.

906
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:31,523
Speaker 0: I dropped out of that class right away But I didn't give up my space and I played with it for a long time.

907
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:34,939
Speaker 0: that space is now gone But that's that's the end of that story.

908
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't do anything cool with it.

909
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,239
Speaker 0: I basically just played around and failed.

910
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,569
Speaker 1: but basically I mean as for using IPv6 now and trans up and you know moving the internet over to it, right?

911
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,137
Speaker 1: It's basically a huge pain right now.

912
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:51,850
Speaker 1: some things you can do are you can you know connect to other?

913
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:58,147
Speaker 1: IPv6 enabled things out there across IPv6 networks, but they're not easy to find.

914
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:01,261
Speaker 1: you sort of have to know It's more than your.

915
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:08,266
Speaker 0: you probably have IPv4 connectivity and IPv6 might be tunneled a lot of IVSPs.

916
01:06:08,286 --> 01:06:09,609
Speaker 0: You're not gonna have direct IPv6.

917
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:13,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really depends on who you are where you are what you're connected to.

918
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:16,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's far out of the scope of this episode to talk about that.

919
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:43,459
Speaker 0: Suffice to say if you were at all interesting interested in networking and IP and IT and all these things if you try to learn how IPv6 works on a fundamental level and if you want to try to learn how to connect to it in The process of learning that you're going to learn a lot about networking and you're doing you're going to become Very competent on a theoretical level very quickly.

920
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:54,105
Speaker 0: So look at IPv6 not as practical knowledge But as a kind of far-out goal that if you seek that goal You will learn a ton on the way kind of like installing Gen 2.

921
01:06:54,105 --> 01:07:01,950
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean they're doing all sorts of weird things these days like they're putting IPv4 addresses inside of IPv6 addresses in there.

922
01:07:02,212 --> 01:07:03,421
Speaker 1: You know, they're tunneling IPv6 over IPv4.

923
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:10,669
Speaker 1: So it's like well, I have an IPv6 network and you have an IPv6 network But there's only an IPv4 network between us.

924
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:13,158
Speaker 1: But we can make this little tunnel and sort of.

925
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:23,680
Speaker 0: now we sort of have an IPv6 network between us and because I mean For most consumers IPv6 is not going to actually matter to you for a long time And even then it's going to be completely transparent to you.

926
01:07:24,102 --> 01:07:25,729
Speaker 0: You'll never really be affected by it.

927
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,790
Speaker 1: Yes, but the reason is taking so long.

928
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:34,052
Speaker 1: This is basically everyone has to switch all their stuff and no one's in a rush to do that because they don't need to Right now.

929
01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:39,032
Speaker 1: this and there's no benefit that you will notice right away You'll you?

930
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:44,456
Speaker 1: basically if I had two networks set up with the same computers and one was six and one is four You couldn't tell a difference.

931
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:45,561
Speaker 1: It's all.

932
01:07:45,922 --> 01:07:47,770
Speaker 1: the difference is all where you can't see it.

933
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:54,230
Speaker 1: It's completely invisible to you as a user but much like Xavocom the possibilities are endless and less possible.

934
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:56,628
Speaker 1: billions and billions of possibilities per square inch.

935
01:08:03,153 --> 01:08:05,742
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
