1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,389
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday June 27th.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,432
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,560
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:22,100
Speaker 1: Tonight we discuss our second annual trip to the museum and of comic and cartoon art arts festival.

5
00:00:24,343 --> 00:00:34,222
Speaker 1: Let's do this Warm today warm yesterday even warmer today.

6
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, fucking it's hot.

7
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:37,530
Speaker 0: It's hot outside.

8
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:38,354
Speaker 1: I don't know.

9
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:39,279
Speaker 1: is it actually?

10
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,570
Speaker 1: I don't think it actually is warmer today than yesterday.

11
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,284
Speaker 1: It's just because I'm used to it from yesterday.

12
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:45,450
Speaker 0: It is more humid today.

13
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:49,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, yesterday was definitely fucking warm and today is also fucking warm warmer.

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,787
Speaker 1: These are the two warmest days of the year so far without a doubt.

15
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:57,685
Speaker 0: yep Which we can definitely see because today the power went out all over the Upper East Side.

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, and all over the Bronx.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,481
Speaker 1: I think that was due to a thunderstorm action.

18
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:03,650
Speaker 0: No it looks like it was a distribution problem.

19
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:10,170
Speaker 1: I was I could I didn't actually hear the news But I someone was like thunderstorm something something and someone else is like power out something something.

20
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:15,670
Speaker 0: What I saw on the news talked about an explosion somewhere in the Bronx as a transformer just had a problem.

21
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:20,070
Speaker 1: Well as a result the the six train stopped working.

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,817
Speaker 1: I basically went down into the subway.

23
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:25,390
Speaker 1: the sixth train was not working, and they wouldn't let me through the turnstile.

24
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,750
Speaker 1: So I walked two blocks to the other six train entrance and when I walked down the stairs the train was working.

25
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know what.

26
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:37,210
Speaker 1: I guess I just got off of work at the exact moment the train was fixed.

27
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, well Metro North luckily.

28
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:44,310
Speaker 0: There's a light little bit of a delay for me, but by the time Scott got on the train I think everything was working normally.

29
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:49,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, my train uses a you know a fossil fuel engine half of the way, so it made it.

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what.

31
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:52,160
Speaker 0: so does the train I was taking?

32
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:54,210
Speaker 0: it was just delayed because of some other train in the way.

33
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:56,518
Speaker 1: See that's the thing about Grand Central is?

34
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:04,579
Speaker 1: you know there's a whole bunch of tracks and in Grand Central But they all pretty much go out to four tracks At 125th Street.

35
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:13,066
Speaker 1: So if there's four trains Every other train on both sides has to wait for those trains to get out into the wherever they're going.

36
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:20,330
Speaker 0: yep of course It's weird how I really hated sitting in the heat outside of Croton Harmon waiting for my late connecting train.

37
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,944
Speaker 0: I thought I was gonna miss it, but then ah my trains late my connecting trains late.

38
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:28,589
Speaker 0: Everything's cool, but That was the most oppressive part just sitting there in the Sun.

39
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:45,609
Speaker 0: My only choice was either sit in the Sun and be hot and there's no wind at all because there's trains in the way And the Sun's just bearing down on me Or I could go inside the unairconditioned greenhouse Which was otherwise known as the shelter and basically be cooked yeah?

40
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:54,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta tell you walking from the train to my car was the suck, but yeah luckily It was only a couple minutes.

41
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:59,728
Speaker 0: riding my bike two miles home in the heat up The hill was nothing compared to sitting in that Sun.

42
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:10,394
Speaker 1: well I mean because you're moving you got some wind blowing on you, and if you ride your bike even when it's not warm out You're gonna get warm, so it doesn't feel any different or weird Whatever today.

43
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,321
Speaker 1: We're keeping the air conditioner on during the show.

44
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:13,245
Speaker 1: It's on right now.

45
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:14,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna stay on.

46
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:18,023
Speaker 1: I Listened to the episode yesterday, and I did not hear the air conditioner.

47
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:26,505
Speaker 1: I will listen to the episode we're recording right now later to see if I hear the air conditioner and Hopefully we'll be able to keep the air conditioner on during the show.

48
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,410
Speaker 1: if I don't hear anything.

49
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:36,930
Speaker 0: But enough meta because both of us have some pretty important news I think I'll let Scott go first because this is something that is very dear to us, and we've talked about it before.

50
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:41,330
Speaker 1: Well there haven't been that many awesome new animes in recent years.

51
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:55,949
Speaker 1: I mean there are a couple movies like the paprika and whatever and There this season there's a couple shows like Volcarano and such claymore claymore that are pretty hot But they're not like awesome animes of all time that will watch again and again.

52
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:58,523
Speaker 1: It's yes It's something I would Netflix and that's something I would buy.

53
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:06,683
Speaker 0: they're not cowboy bebop They're not the show where I'll forgo all other forms of entertainment Like I'll come home from work and say I gotta watch the next episode.

54
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:07,406
Speaker 0: I gotta see it.

55
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,149
Speaker 0: I gotta see it.

56
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh Nana.

57
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,350
Speaker 1: I guess but that's also a Netflixing show.

58
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:19,009
Speaker 0: That's just because we lost track and we stopped watching at like one critical juncture And then the fan subs just went way beyond us.

59
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:27,495
Speaker 1: yeah, anyway, the one show in recent years that I've cared a whole lot about and wanted to see desperately is project blue cheek.

60
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:34,000
Speaker 1: you SOS project blue earth SOS cheek you means earth and We talked about it in an episode and basically.

61
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,270
Speaker 1: It's it's an OVA of six episodes not an OAV.

62
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:42,870
Speaker 1: Yes, each episode is 45 minutes long about and it's fucking awesome.

63
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,997
Speaker 1: We did an episode on it.

64
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,170
Speaker 1: if you want to know more about the show you can go listen to that episode.

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:54,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, really really simply imagine a future sci-fi show But the future sci-fi as envisioned in the 50s.

66
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:58,033
Speaker 1: if you like the read or die OAV you'll like this.

67
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,054
Speaker 0: you'll like this a lot.

68
00:04:59,074 --> 00:05:01,157
Speaker 0: if you like encyclopedia brown you like this.

69
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:08,363
Speaker 0: if you like the idea of Spaceships coexisting with flash powder cameras and reel to reels.

70
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:09,446
Speaker 0: This is for you.

71
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:12,153
Speaker 1: Yes, so This show.

72
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:15,803
Speaker 1: today a TV just announced that they have licensed this show.

73
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,247
Speaker 0: hot shit.

74
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,550
Speaker 0: It's about time.

75
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:20,239
Speaker 0: Why didn't they license it earlier?

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,244
Speaker 0: What was the story?

77
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:22,410
Speaker 0: Why did this get delayed?

78
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,091
Speaker 1: I don't know.

79
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:28,130
Speaker 1: it just says we are proud to announce we have licensed this show for distribution in the u.s Blabbity blabbity blah.

80
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:33,650
Speaker 1: I I'm so happy that this was licensed that I'm pretty much gonna buy this as soon as it comes out.

81
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,830
Speaker 1: But there's a chance I won't because remember it's six 45 minute episodes.

82
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:45,084
Speaker 1: Right if they release this on One set like you buy it for like $30 you get the whole show.

83
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:46,870
Speaker 1: even $40 you get the whole show.

84
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:47,636
Speaker 0: I might pay 50.

85
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,390
Speaker 1: I wouldn't pay 50 for the whole show.

86
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:59,190
Speaker 1: I might but if they do this like three separate DVD business where each DVD has two Episodes and each DVD is full retail price.

87
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:04,349
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give them the big double deuce until they lower that price down and sell it in one set.

88
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,078
Speaker 0: Well, you're probably gonna have to wait.

89
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:10,824
Speaker 1: remember what happened with blue sub six, yeah Yeah, that was bullshit, but that was in the olden days.

90
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:17,467
Speaker 1: and well I'm pretty confident that they are going to release it in two discs of three episodes each.

91
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:18,350
Speaker 0: That is my prediction.

92
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:18,949
Speaker 0: I don't know.

93
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:26,293
Speaker 0: I'm pretty confident that they're gonna drag it out and I I would imagine that they're going to market this heavily Cuz.

94
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,801
Speaker 0: it does kind of stand out.

95
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:42,890
Speaker 0: I mean the fact that they picked it up Relatively quickly despite the fact that I was complaining about how long it took Says something and it's a show that's really different from a lot of other shows that are out right now And it has high production values and I could see if they marketed it right making a lot of money off of it.

96
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:44,990
Speaker 1: No, I don't think they can make a lot of money off the show.

97
00:06:45,130 --> 00:07:01,689
Speaker 1: I think that what this is is it shows you that CPM is gone, right and ADV unlike Funimation and Genian who mostly you know are very big licensed shows because they want to sell them and they try to sell every show they get.

98
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:07,929
Speaker 1: ADV still occasionally is gonna license a show just because they think it's awesome whether they think it's gonna sell or not.

99
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:17,276
Speaker 1: and while ADV You know is not perfect in terms of anime releasing like I don't know who is perfect in terms of anime releasing Ah, no one.

100
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,124
Speaker 1: anime egos kind of perfect.

101
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:22,034
Speaker 1: It's just they don't do quantity They just do quality.

102
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:25,584
Speaker 0: and I've had some good ones regular bandai not bandai vision.

103
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:26,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

104
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're their problems.

105
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:36,276
Speaker 1: But you know ADV I think is is showing that they're still there for the fans as well as there for the monies Depending on the price and all that.

106
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:40,190
Speaker 0: I would I'd highly recommend you pay just about anything for this at least for the first episode.

107
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:43,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty much I'm gonna when it comes out.

108
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,770
Speaker 1: I'll see what the you know, there's no release date yet.

109
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:56,360
Speaker 1: So I'll see what the episode per discount and the prices and then I'll either buy it on Amazon right away Or I'll wait till I see it at a convention and get it then.

110
00:07:56,441 --> 00:08:04,848
Speaker 1: or who knows it depends on a lot of things But by this show if you buy any anime in the next year or two, this is it.

111
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:06,573
Speaker 0: Yes Right.

112
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:16,890
Speaker 0: So in the other related unrelated semi related anime news Otakon has finally started to get its act together at least in the sense that we know the musical acts are.

113
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:22,510
Speaker 0: They've for the most part dealt with the panel situation and a couple other things.

114
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:23,936
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna start right off that.

115
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:29,278
Speaker 0: the two musical acts this year one is triple-a Attack all around.

116
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,744
Speaker 0: I don't know much about him.

117
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:32,070
Speaker 1: That sounds the opposite of me.

118
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,315
Speaker 1: I'm attack only one.

119
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:37,030
Speaker 1: So how are they attack all around that their philosophies do not match?

120
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,914
Speaker 0: Well, it looks like they did.

121
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:44,123
Speaker 0: the theme song to the live-action initial D Terrible live-action initial D. The music was okay Music.

122
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:47,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, the music wasn't so bad.

123
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,205
Speaker 1: I don't remember it being bad or good.

124
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:54,890
Speaker 1: So yeah, whatever I'm sure they're a band that will play live and I imagine some sort of music.

125
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:01,912
Speaker 0: So I'm ambivalent partly because last year I hadn't heard a mock and I figured I stopped the same thing about muck and muck was Awesome.

126
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:05,563
Speaker 1: Yep, so, you know, we'll just have to wait and see on the triple-a.

127
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:19,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I wish their name was attack only one A OO yep, but much more important and much more interesting and this is the concert that I am going to kill people to see Eminence.

128
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:20,775
Speaker 0: to sum it up.

129
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:28,487
Speaker 0: They take violins and various classical instruments and they perform anime video game music.

130
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:43,039
Speaker 0: Titles will include this is quoting from the Otakon website dot hack Gundam seed Princess Mononoke Lapita Ava noir Totoro crud across Dino saga Romeo ex Juliet and Other memorable themes to name a few.

131
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,335
Speaker 1: Oh, this is pretty good actually because you know Even though many people probably haven't heard of Eminence I don't know who these specific people are.

132
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:54,569
Speaker 1: the the idea of playing geeky music with.

133
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:58,769
Speaker 1: you know A classical orchestra or a string quartet or any sort of other?

134
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,802
Speaker 1: Classical arrangement is very popular these days.

135
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,470
Speaker 1: the video games live is popular.

136
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,784
Speaker 0: Oh the video game pianist pianist is popular was a pretty cool dude.

137
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:19,226
Speaker 1: whenever they release, you know They release like orchestral soundtracks of like, you know Final Fantasy Phoenix Wright music even the Final Fantasy that's in phonics sweets, which was recorded live in Japan.

138
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:23,664
Speaker 0: a long time brothers I Imported that when I was in high school and I paid $40 for it.

139
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:38,309
Speaker 1: This kind of stuff is becoming very popular in the geek culture and it's still you know Maintaining its popularity and in fact a lot of you know orchestras and things weren't making so much money doing their typical classical musics.

140
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:48,110
Speaker 1: you know their Beethoven's and their Mozart's and a lot of them have decided to start playing geeky music and holding those sorts of concerts and they found They're making a lot more money that way.

141
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:57,089
Speaker 0: I see this being very similar to what I imagine was the motivation behind not all but definitely some of the nerdcore artists out there.

142
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:03,030
Speaker 0: It seems like not to name names but a lot of the mediocre to average nerdcore rappers.

143
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:12,440
Speaker 0: We're just crappy normal rappers and realize that there's this weird niche market that will give them an automatic plus three to sales Just because they sing about D&D instead of hoes.

144
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:29,210
Speaker 1: I think that while there are a few people like that I think that a greater percentage of the nerdcore rappers are either people who happen to be like rap and Were geeks or geeks who saw nerdcore rap and decided to start rapping.

145
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:33,263
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah but I definitely I think that it was a factor in the decision of some of these people.

146
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,347
Speaker 1: not there is indeed

147
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:47,830
Speaker 0: and I think I mean, I'm definitely not the case with these people But yeah I could see a lot of the people doing this if you've got a skill and you find an audience that is willing to pay You to exhibit your skill in a way that's very easy to exhibit.

148
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,370
Speaker 0: I mean most of this video game music except I assume they'll have some special arrange things for this.

149
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:53,816
Speaker 0: It's pretty easy to play.

150
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:55,302
Speaker 0: I mean I can play the Zelda theme.

151
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:55,844
Speaker 1: Yep.

152
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:57,310
Speaker 1: It's not a hard one.

153
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why the video game pianist.

154
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,368
Speaker 1: He adds a whole lot to the music.

155
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,563
Speaker 0: Yep Well, he also noticed how he'd play video game video game real song.

156
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,410
Speaker 0: video game video game real song.

157
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,821
Speaker 1: Yep, I think part of that is he's trying to show you.

158
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,497
Speaker 1: Hey, the real songs are awesome, too Yeah, but the quote real song.

159
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:15,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to imply the song is it's not.

160
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:16,910
Speaker 1: you can't make a fake song.

161
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:18,217
Speaker 1: It's either a song or not.

162
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,750
Speaker 0: I don't want to imply that video game music is somehow less here.

163
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,557
Speaker 1: This is a song doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

164
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:24,861
Speaker 1: That was a song right there.

165
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,425
Speaker 0: I mean music by no boo.

166
00:12:26,806 --> 00:12:29,266
Speaker 0: Yep, but also Otakon.

167
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:32,906
Speaker 0: There's a good and a bad about what's been going on with panels.

168
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,541
Speaker 0: as you all know There were some issues with panels at Otakon.

169
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:37,270
Speaker 0: we complained about it a while ago.

170
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:46,717
Speaker 0: several Otakon staffers got back with us within an hour of our episode going up haha and The situation is somewhat resolved.

171
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:50,009
Speaker 0: Otakon has released the list of the panels that are going to be at Otakon.

172
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,439
Speaker 0: Four of them are our band panels.

173
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,282
Speaker 0: Yeah the fan panel.

174
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:55,370
Speaker 0: They list the industry panels - oh, that's good.

175
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:56,798
Speaker 0: And of course those.

176
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:59,050
Speaker 0: well, they were on the same list at the same time.

177
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:02,085
Speaker 1: No, I think I looked at it right away and there they were there.

178
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,170
Speaker 1: They were not there immediately.

179
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were later.

180
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:06,210
Speaker 0: I think I'm pretty sure they were there Scott.

181
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:11,567
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm a hundred percent sure that at as deep when they post the at the moment.

182
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:12,490
Speaker 0: They what do you say?

183
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:17,284
Speaker 1: They originally posted the fan panels the under the industry panels heading.

184
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:18,186
Speaker 1: It said coming soon.

185
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:21,617
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Oh, well, I'm doubtful.

186
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:22,460
Speaker 0: I don't believe you.

187
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,630
Speaker 1: I will just have to find someone else who looked at that immediately.

188
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:27,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one because no one seemed to know.

189
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,583
Speaker 0: Yeah.

190
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:32,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah I'm not gonna really go over the whole list other than that.

191
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,690
Speaker 0: four of them are ours and one in particular.

192
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:39,590
Speaker 0: I'd like to put a plug out for a self plug because I think this is gonna be a pretty badass panel.

193
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:46,310
Speaker 0: Myself Scott and Gerald from anime world order not Daryl because he's a wuss who is afraid of Otakon.

194
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:51,602
Speaker 0: I won't come back and I Yeah, I'm calling you out Daryl not coming back to Otakon.

195
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:52,626
Speaker 0: I didn't you have a good time.

196
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,510
Speaker 0: Gerald had a good time.

197
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I just didn't want to have a good time.

198
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think cuz I remember when I was walking around and I kept him running into Gerald and Daryl at Otakon.

199
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,043
Speaker 0: Gerald was you know Hey blah blah blah.

200
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:11,230
Speaker 0: check this out Check this out and Daryl was like going out of his way to find the things that would piss him off the most and then Sticking around to make sure those things pissed him off.

201
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:19,950
Speaker 0: But Anyway, the three of us are doing a panel entitled Gekiga putting the man back in manga.

202
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:26,168
Speaker 0: It's gonna be Friday or Saturday night in the 18 plus block and I can guarantee there's gonna be a lot of mr.

203
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:26,710
Speaker 0: Tokai.

204
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:27,794
Speaker 1: Mr.

205
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:30,044
Speaker 0: Tokai, I'm all about this panel.

206
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,410
Speaker 1: This is gonna be a hot panel.

207
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:51,878
Speaker 1: I'm telling you if you are someone who likes the the manly mangas or If you are someone who you know would like to read some mangas but you know all you go to the borders and all you see is girly stuff and Shown in fighting stuff and you know, there's nothing that really appeals to the manly man who likes, you know rape.

208
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,300
Speaker 1: Then this is a panel for you, we're also doing the panel at kinetic on well practicing the panel at Connecticut.

209
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,758
Speaker 0: well, we're doing the same basic panel, but we're not gonna have Gerald and his.

210
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:13,980
Speaker 0: uh, Let's just say that Gerald has been thinking about what he is going to talk about as the like the conclusion to this panel For a long time and we're not gonna have that with us at Connecticut.

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,273
Speaker 0: So we're gonna have to put some sort of substandard filler in to take up its place Probably just question-and-answer type stuff.

212
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:21,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that I was.

213
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:25,616
Speaker 1: you know, that's the greatest thing about running a panel is I love question answer.

214
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:26,579
Speaker 1: That's like my favorite part.

215
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:28,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's so easy.

216
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,458
Speaker 1: you just stand up there and I know and more than anyone could possibly ask in that room.

217
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,880
Speaker 0: and Well, it depends on what panel we're doing.

218
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:45,139
Speaker 1: I mean the only person who could probably yeah But I'm not gonna do a any panel I would do if someone asks a relevant question I can answer ninety nine point nine to nine percent of the time.

219
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:53,859
Speaker 1: the only way someone could defeat me is if like Gerald was there in the audience instead of yeah, and he tried to ask me About something I didn't know and he knew I didn't know it.

220
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:58,980
Speaker 1: So I just stand up there and people ask questions and I'm like BAM BAM BAM BAM.

221
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,057
Speaker 0: See at the same time I kind of dislike it.

222
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:01,440
Speaker 0: just be cool.

223
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,163
Speaker 0: Maybe it's because the panel I've done more than any panel at any con ever is the hotter on an anime Questions.

224
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,912
Speaker 0: every time it people ask like.

225
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:15,697
Speaker 0: it's amazing that people ask the exact same Questions and almost the exact same order every year for five years running.

226
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,300
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that's why it's good to mix up the panel though

227
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:28,820
Speaker 0: I must say and I want to remind everyone that at Kinetic on last year when we took over the anime club panel That we're running a kinetic on this year Someone asked a question that we'd never run into before.

228
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,590
Speaker 1: That was the greatest question probably ever at any panel.

229
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,275
Speaker 0: it was that guy was pretty cool too.

230
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,500
Speaker 0: I wish I remembered his name.

231
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, give him a shout out and he was dressed up as the guy from Ranma who runs around the world.

232
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:39,716
Speaker 0: Yep.

233
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:40,739
Speaker 1: What's his name?

234
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:45,256
Speaker 1: Some anime fans we are God.

235
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:48,619
Speaker 0: I Last time I watched Ranma was when I was in high school.

236
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:52,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Ranma guy who runs around the world with the leopard skin stuff Pichan.

237
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:54,359
Speaker 0: No, no, he turns into Pichan.

238
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:54,740
Speaker 0: Does he?

239
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,265
Speaker 1: Oh the pig, right?

240
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:56,586
Speaker 1: Yeah.

241
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd have to look it up on the Wikipedia or something to see.

242
00:16:59,596 --> 00:17:02,703
Speaker 0: not normally a normal Yoga, yes, yoga.

243
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:03,405
Speaker 0: Aha.

244
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:08,440
Speaker 0: I am the geekier see normally and in you know, one of those erudite anime.

245
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,739
Speaker 0: I didn't look that up by the way.

246
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:17,169
Speaker 0: They would have cut that out looked it up and then just said well he was dressed up as yoga But we play it loose by the wire.

247
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,057
Speaker 0: We don't edit anything out.

248
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:19,740
Speaker 1: and rim was here.

249
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,845
Speaker 1: He can he can testify.

250
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,010
Speaker 1: I did not touch my keyboard.

251
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,359
Speaker 0: Yeah coming up with that answer, of course I don't actually look at Scott.

252
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,789
Speaker 0: I'm usually staring at various meters still here.

253
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:31,000
Speaker 0: if I go ticky ticky ticky ticky I can because the microphones right there.

254
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:34,012
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, there's the more interesting thing Otakon did.

255
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:38,449
Speaker 0: on June 22nd There was an announcement on the Otakon website.

256
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:40,577
Speaker 1: They didn't tell them what question that real good guy is.

257
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:41,260
Speaker 0: Of course not.

258
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,459
Speaker 0: That was part of my plan.

259
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:46,874
Speaker 0: Haha, I was expecting that to just slide and someone in the forum is gonna be like.

260
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:48,580
Speaker 0: so what question did that guy ask?

261
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,960
Speaker 0: and My answer was gonna be well you best come to Kinetic on and see us in case he comes and asks it again.

262
00:17:55,445 --> 00:18:02,594
Speaker 0: You stole my thunder right like so June 22nd, you see what happens when it's hot out.

263
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,280
Speaker 0: We just we lose all sense of logic.

264
00:18:04,762 --> 00:18:05,867
Speaker 1: I could barely stay awake here.

265
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,439
Speaker 0: Are you know, I felt I almost missed my stop.

266
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:11,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't almost miss my stop, but I was worried.

267
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:12,076
Speaker 1: I'd miss my stop.

268
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:13,060
Speaker 0: You know, it's cold spring.

269
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,068
Speaker 1: I was so sleepy.

270
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,338
Speaker 0: So I'm like, alright beacons.

271
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:31,496
Speaker 0: next I'm gonna close my eyes and I'm thinking but people around me might think that I'm gonna fall asleep But now I'll show them I'm gonna wake up and then get off and then suddenly I wake up and the doors are open and I think uh And I get up very quickly and I walk out and I'm in beacon.

272
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:37,380
Speaker 0: Yeah I was this close to missing my train and ending up in New Hamburg and that would have sucked.

273
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:38,948
Speaker 1: No, it is sucked ass cuz.

274
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:41,280
Speaker 0: I drove to New Hamburg once it's in the middle of nowhere.

275
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a good place.

277
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:54,351

284
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,138
Speaker 0: as far as I can see they didn't send out an email.

285
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:32,889
Speaker 0: Uh, I can say based on other panelists.

286
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:35,257
Speaker 0: I talked to that not many people saw this announcement.

287
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:50,320
Speaker 0: Yeah nope, nope, nope, and I'm expecting I mean not many people have been posting much about it in the forums But there are a lot of panels listed here and I'm expecting there to be some sort of trouble at Otacon proper when panelists who?

288
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:57,460
Speaker 1: Registered by check didn't pay and then can't get in even though they have panels and their names are on the panels and whatever.

289
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus it was funny I mean we.

290
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:08,715
Speaker 0: well I got approval for a panel that I submitted for someone else But yet I did not actually get approval for the gecky guy putting the man back in manga panel.

291
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,540
Speaker 0: That is most definitely mine.

292
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:11,908
Speaker 0: I know what else submitted.

293
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:16,260
Speaker 0: that panel with that name is 19 plus Yeah.

294
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:20,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know I'm not really busting Otacon's balls because I think everything's coming together.

295
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:26,140
Speaker 0: I just I think the panels at Otacon could be run better in the future.

296
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,594
Speaker 0: And I'm not saying oh because this year there was a problem.

297
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:39,320
Speaker 0: I understand that We we were told basically exactly what the problem was and I sympathize It was a problem where Otacon did the best they could to cover it up and fix it and make everything work.

298
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:44,157
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna say that last year I don't think the panels were run too well either.

299
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:46,820
Speaker 0: and the year before that I don't think they were run too well either.

300
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,366
Speaker 0: I mean they work they haven't.

301
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:52,380
Speaker 0: but I was not impressed with my dealings with the people running the panels in the past.

302
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:59,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think generally the number one problem seems to be a failure at communication with the members of Otacon.

303
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:07,580
Speaker 0: now see if we were one of those other podcasts we'd probably play some sort of soundbite there like What we have here is a failure to communicate.

304
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:08,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that.

305
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:17,887
Speaker 1: It's just that Otacon seems to assume that you know The people who go to Otacon must go to the Otacon website every day of the year I mean you have to.

306
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:23,960
Speaker 1: when you make an announcement about panels You should have an email list that has everyone who's doing a panel.

307
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:34,768
Speaker 0: Well an email all of them to their credit and you know as well as I do Why that was not the case and there's really nothing they could do about that at least nothing they could Once they fixed it.

308
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:39,445
Speaker 0: there is nothing they could do about that fact at After it had happened there.

309
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:47,760
Speaker 0: They could have done something about that had they run panels differently, but that's entirely beside the point No, but I mean like now that they actually created the list of panels.

310
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,428
Speaker 1: They know who's doing all those panels that they listed.

311
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:52,855
Speaker 1: They know the email addresses of those people.

312
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,460
Speaker 1: Why did they notify them?

313
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,932
Speaker 0: Well more importantly I wonder why they set such a short deadline suddenly like that.

314
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,620
Speaker 0: if anything I would have been.

315
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:09,115
Speaker 0: The issue is that since the people doing the panels had to work on short notice anyway And they basically pulled a hey if you didn't see this just now.

316
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:10,000
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get a free badge.

317
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:12,375
Speaker 0: I think they could have handled it better.

318
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:17,680
Speaker 0: if anything I would have set up a system to just count people at the door or fix it after the fact with refunds or something.

319
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:18,980
Speaker 1: Is it really that hard?

320
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,687
Speaker 1: I mean You know if someone's doing a panel or not.

321
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,252
Speaker 1: is it really that big a mystery?

322
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:28,569
Speaker 1: if someone comes in to the con and they Doing a panel you send them to the con ops.

323
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:31,980
Speaker 1: the con ops can easily verify if that person's doing a panel.

324
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:34,149
Speaker 0: I mean, I know panel cons do things differently.

325
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,314
Speaker 0: I mean some cons.

326
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:40,944
Speaker 0: I've gone to and just said hey Let me in free and they just do and some pound cons They gotta fill stuff out.

327
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:45,260
Speaker 0: some cons can trick keep track of how many panels we run and then they give us money back.

328
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:53,910
Speaker 0: But in old Otakons when I did a panel I usually just walk in and say hey I'm a panelist and they had me an associates badge Usually without questions asked.

329
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,580
Speaker 0: I know they don't have associates badges anymore.

330
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, they eliminated the associates badge now.

331
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,199
Speaker 1: They just pay for your regular bed.

332
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:12,880
Speaker 0: granted It's probably good that they've regulated it a little bit more because it was startling how easy it was to convince someone to give me a badge in old Otakons and If I were an unscrupulous person, I probably could have just gone in and gotten a badge if I'd known the right words to say

333
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:20,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess it's good that they have some sort of system, but regardless they still Seem to not be perfect on everything.

334
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

335
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,187
Speaker 0: Maybe someone else should run panels at Otakon next year.

336
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:27,749
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know.

337
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,030
Speaker 0: I can't.

338
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:29,545
Speaker 0: Can you think it?

339
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,500
Speaker 0: you know one or two people who maybe really care about anime?

340
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,930
Speaker 0: Kind of a little bit related to the industry.

341
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,100
Speaker 0: Maybe they know a lot about how to run panels at cons.

342
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:41,900
Speaker 0: Maybe they're staffers at a whole bunch of other cons have a lot of experience.

343
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:43,385
Speaker 1: I don't know.

344
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:47,884
Speaker 0: many people like that have a lot of ideas as to how to run Panels at a con.

345
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:56,739
Speaker 0: maybe people who have their own personal staff all ready to go already have a system in place Already figured out how they were to run the panels for Otakon.

346
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:00,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we should run the panels at Otakon.

347
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:10,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think also and if Otakon doesn't let us do it and they pick someone else then That person better be awesome or else Otakon is a fool because we're dead.

348
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:11,880
Speaker 1: Otakon doesn't believe us.

349
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:21,180
Speaker 1: We're gonna walk the walk here if we do it and then screw up you can Make fun of us and shit talk us all you want because you'll be right now.

350
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,070
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I mean do a better job than anyone's ever done.

351
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,158
Speaker 1: Then you got nothing to say.

352
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:31,398
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I just got to say because Kineticon again to their credit when we said your panels all suck.

353
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:33,333
Speaker 0: They said fine Why don't you run some panels?

354
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,543
Speaker 0: and here we go We will.

355
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,779
Speaker 0: and they said fine you're running nine and we said nine.

356
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,053
Speaker 1: fine We can do that and we're gonna do that and that's gonna show them.

357
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:41,118
Speaker 0: It's gonna be awesome.

358
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:44,400
Speaker 1: Yep It's basically they might as well just call it Rimm and Skatakon.

359
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:48,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, except there's actually a lot more than nine panels at the con.

360
00:24:51,102 --> 00:24:52,708
Speaker 1: We could just take over Kineticon.

361
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:58,007
Speaker 1: instead of like starting our own geek nights like special front row crew con I'd rather take over Katsucon.

362
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's too big.

363
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:00,479
Speaker 1: We can't eat it.

364
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:03,771
Speaker 0: See, the thing is Katsucon is too awesome more edible and closer.

365
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:05,276
Speaker 0: Let's take over Torakon.

366
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,099
Speaker 0: Let's go back to RIT.

367
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:08,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, Wow think about that.

368
00:25:08,912 --> 00:25:15,253
Speaker 0: we could just re-enroll at RIT Run take over the anime club take over the Torakon and just have a convention.

369
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,060
Speaker 0: We could yeah enough people still know our names.

370
00:25:18,161 --> 00:25:20,120
Speaker 0: Back there we could get the votes easily.

371
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:42,329
Speaker 0: That's kind of like sanctuary if the people in sanctuary had really really low expectations and we're really striving for much Like yeah, we're gonna take over the McDonald's on 4th Avenue things of the day.

372
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:52,849
Speaker 0: So, uh, our friend Ido who is often giving us wonderful things of the day and the one who told us about Washington, you know six foot twelve fucking killing for fun.

373
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:58,229
Speaker 0: Washington Washington, I mean he saves children, but not the albionic children.

374
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:02,090
Speaker 0: Yep Well, apparently guy who did that did something else.

375
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:07,080
Speaker 0: basically, it is a history of Sodom and Gomorrah as told by.

376
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,150
Speaker 1: it's not history that say the story.

377
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,890
Speaker 0: Well the story the the fictitious history the juneo-christian mythology of Sodom and Gomorrah.

378
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:24,546
Speaker 0: Yep And I don't know what I find funnier when the professor winks at the kid When the guy's having sex with the fire or when Jesus and God high-five at the end.

379
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:27,223
Speaker 1: I don't know It's all good all around.

380
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:29,876
Speaker 1: basically Whoever's making these things?

381
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:31,180
Speaker 0: Brad Neely.

382
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:32,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's my new favorite.

383
00:26:32,664 --> 00:26:33,065
Speaker 1: Whatever.

384
00:26:33,286 --> 00:26:38,019
Speaker 1: He needs to make more things Make it easier to find all of his things.

385
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:42,930
Speaker 0: I haven't watched much else yet on the site, but so far It's all been rather delectable.

386
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,390
Speaker 0: But seriously, this thing is hilarious.

387
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:48,494
Speaker 0: It's a little bit.

388
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:53,230
Speaker 0: uh, it might offend you but if you're offended by this then how the hell are you listening to geek nights?

389
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,914
Speaker 1: I don't know.

390
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:56,435
Speaker 1: some people They got problems.

391
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:59,246
Speaker 1: It's like they're offended by things but they keep listening to them.

392
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,836
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Well, uh, I don't know.

393
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:08,995
Speaker 0: maybe when the people have sex with the rocks that are shaped like painted like God's head Or the oats the oats.

394
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:10,338
Speaker 0: Oh the oats.

395
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,221
Speaker 1: Yeah.

396
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:11,622
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:12,564
Speaker 1: All right.

398
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:15,998
Speaker 1: Well way back I don't know if it was ever a thing of the day.

399
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:16,782
Speaker 1: I think it might have been.

400
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:29,344
Speaker 1: somebody took a box Right and in the box They cut a hole in the side and they mounted a Kodak or I guess I don't know if it was Kodak brand But a disposable camera in the side of the box and they be revealed.

401
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:34,589
Speaker 1: they had a button wired up so that you just push this button on the box to make the box take a picture.

402
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:52,370
Speaker 1: and They sent this box through the mail with instructions on the outside of the box telling the postal workers to take pictures of things with the box and then When he got the box at the destination He would see pictures of whatever the postal workers decided to show him and that was pretty cool.

403
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:53,288
Speaker 1: That was a cool thing of the day.

404
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:54,836
Speaker 1: Someone saw this?

405
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:56,523
Speaker 1: or I believe they saw it.

406
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,010
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I don't know how they thought of this.

407
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:04,670
Speaker 1: They did basically not just twice as good as they get that guy but ten thousand times as good as that guy.

408
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:10,310
Speaker 1: Well, I guess mathematically, let's see seven thousand divided by about thirty is how much better?

409
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,076
Speaker 0: Well, it is a little bit different in that.

410
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:14,042
Speaker 0: It's more voyeuristic and less.

411
00:28:14,404 --> 00:28:16,210
Speaker 0: Hey, see how cool people are along the way

412
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:48,739
Speaker 1: That's true but he took a box and he put in a camera and he put in some hard drives and some batteries and some electronic circuitry that he wired up and He basically made a video camera that would take a picture every 10 seconds and he sent it through the mail In this box and when he got it on the other end there were six thousand nine hundred ninety four pictures and he edited them together to make a Animated slideshow of the boxes travels through the postal system and it's pretty cool.

413
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:56,720
Speaker 1: Right, you can see like the mail truck and the sorting facility in his house and the mailbox and all sorts of stuff.

414
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,122
Speaker 1: It's good.

415
00:28:57,745 --> 00:28:59,213
Speaker 0: I just love clever things like that.

416
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:00,620
Speaker 0: And this is pretty cool to check out.

417
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is you can't actually see the whole video.

418
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:17,579
Speaker 1: I mean if you can I'm having a hard time finding it, but there is a tiny Small section of the stills from the animated film and there's pictures of the inside of the box Which is very cool also and pretty much you're gonna see all the important bits if not the whole film

419
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:19,182
Speaker 0: Right.

420
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:25,560
Speaker 0: So over the weekend we decided to trek out as is our annual tradition after our second annual last year.

421
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,480
Speaker 0: Yep to the mocha for the mocha art festival the mocha arts festival.

422
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:33,120
Speaker 1: The mocha is the Museum of comic and cartoon art.

423
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,600
Speaker 1: I think it used to be in Florida if I remember because I think I went to it when it was in, Florida.

424
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:40,109
Speaker 1: I might be wrong about that, but I'm pretty sure I'm not.

425
00:29:40,571 --> 00:30:05,066
Speaker 1: and it's in New York now and every year They have the biggest fundraiser of the year for them, which is the Arts Festival, which is in the puck building which is a nice building down in right two blocks away from where I work and basically all sorts of comic artists of varying shapes and sizes Come set up a table and hawk their wares and display their arts and you pay I think eight bucks to walk around for a day and look at everything.

426
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,614
Speaker 1: and it is it's basically a bargain for eight.

427
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:10,806
Speaker 0: but imagine gigantic artist alley full of Nothing, but awesome.

428
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:18,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, the reason the mocha is so cool Is that unlike other comic conventions which are say primarily a dealer's room and such like that?

429
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:32,126
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just an artist alley perhaps bigger than any other artists alley even like the Otacon artist alley in terms of quantity and quality and you go up to a table and you'll see a comic and There's a 90% chance of.

430
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,674
Speaker 1: the person behind the table is the person who made that comic.

431
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:36,740
Speaker 1: and that is way way cool.

432
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:45,448
Speaker 1: because I mean our friends are buying comics and they didn't even realize they were buying it from the creator and then the creator were Like draw doodle in it and sign it and they'd be like, whoa.

433
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,314
Speaker 1: I didn't realize.

434
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:53,514
Speaker 1: and sometimes, you know It's like a big semi famous creator and sometimes it's just some nobody.

435
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,359
Speaker 1: you just discovered them and just like hey, what's up?

436
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:04,020
Speaker 1: But no matter who it is or how famous they are you walk up to them and you're like hi How you doing and they talk to you like they're your friend and I've never met anyone who is mean there ever.

437
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,926
Speaker 1: And it's way cool.

438
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:10,080
Speaker 0: So let's talk about who we meet met before we talk about what we bought or what we saw.

439
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:10,983
Speaker 1: Oh, let's see.

440
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:13,332
Speaker 1: The first person people we saw were all our friends.

441
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:13,874
Speaker 0: Yep.

442
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,560
Speaker 0: We ran into the ninja consultants.

443
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,806
Speaker 0: Yep, Aaron one of them.

444
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:17,470
Speaker 0: I didn't see.

445
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,274
Speaker 0: I saw both of them.

446
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,078
Speaker 0: Oh, I only saw one.

447
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,187
Speaker 1: Yeah I talked to them all about Otacon and such.

448
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:22,833
Speaker 1: so we're straight with them.

449
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:23,355
Speaker 1: They're cool.

450
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:24,400
Speaker 1: ninja consultants rock.

451
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:25,926
Speaker 1: Who else do we see?

452
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:34,900
Speaker 1: I finally got to meet stupid not stupid but Steve cloud the guy who makes boases who I have tried to see at many conventions and he's just never been there.

453
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,828
Speaker 0: We've always just not been able to find him.

454
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:37,892
Speaker 0: He's the most awesome guy.

455
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:42,519
Speaker 0: Yeah boy on a stick and slither is Easily in my top three of webcomic.

456
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,895
Speaker 1: It's tied for my number one webcomic miss along with a few like penny arcade.

457
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:48,380
Speaker 0: that penny arcade order the stick.

458
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:49,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, and dr.

459
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:51,692
Speaker 1: McNinchy guy was there as usual.

460
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:52,976
Speaker 1: I've seen him a whole bunch of time.

461
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:53,679
Speaker 0: He's really cool.

462
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:59,224
Speaker 1: Yep Brian Lee O'Malley the guy who makes Scott pilgrim was there.

463
00:31:59,244 --> 00:32:00,187
Speaker 1: He was there last year.

464
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:01,251
Speaker 1: Also you hesitated.

465
00:32:01,632 --> 00:32:03,478
Speaker 0: you hesitated to say Scott pilgrim.

466
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,957
Speaker 1: Yep I had to remember what it was that makes you weak Scott pilgrim for is coming out.

467
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:08,560
Speaker 0: You must be ready.

468
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,443
Speaker 1: I already pre-ordered it.

469
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:11,009
Speaker 0: good so I can read it.

470
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, he drew a sketch of my pirate book.

471
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:22,975
Speaker 0: Yep However, his sketch was definitely filled with the rye irony of someone who did not particularly want to draw the particular thing That Scott had asked him to draw which is the idea.

472
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:26,518
Speaker 1: Yes Let's see who else was there.

473
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:36,254
Speaker 0: There was an unfortunate moment where see and this is Scott doesn't have this problem as much but I do Because I know names but I have no idea what any of these kind of only

474
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:37,839
Speaker 1: reason I'll keep going

475
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:44,960
Speaker 0: Alright, but I don't know any of these people look like at all and some of them just don't wear their name tags Or they wear them kind of obscured.

476
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:51,280
Speaker 0: So I generally have to kind of wait and I won't talk to anyone behind a table until I see a name tag.

477
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,480
Speaker 0: So I don't make a faux pas or do anything wrong.

478
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:56,596
Speaker 0: But Scott said he was gonna go over and talk to mr.

479
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:57,199
Speaker 0: Scott pilgrim.

480
00:32:57,701 --> 00:33:08,980
Speaker 0: So he goes over and we lose sight of him and then another friend of ours walks over and sees him talking to a kind Of geeky looking guy with glasses just after he had said I'm gonna go talk to the Scott pilgrim guy.

481
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:13,620
Speaker 0: So this person assumed that it was in fact the Scott pilgrim guy and hilarity ensued.

482
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:15,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, all was taken in good fun.

483
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:21,662
Speaker 1: in fact the only reason I knew who that was is that it was Steven cloud was because he was wearing a shirt where the cloud On it.

484
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:22,324
Speaker 0: Yes.

485
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:23,911
Speaker 1: However, that is I would not have known.

486
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,920
Speaker 0: that's a little bit of out-of-the-box thinking.

487
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:33,571
Speaker 1: Actually, I think I had seen that shirt elsewhere before and like I'd known that he had it or something It must have been on the website or see.

488
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:34,034
Speaker 0: so lucky.

489
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,842
Speaker 0: He can just wear a picture of a cloud I got.

490
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:40,160
Speaker 0: there's no picture of a decoster unless they were I don't know a shirt with a picture of my dad on it.

491
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,226
Speaker 0: I can get a picture of a sandwich Speaking of which I saw you bought some bread.

492
00:33:46,246 --> 00:33:46,969
Speaker 0: I did.

493
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:48,676
Speaker 1: I bought a rye bread because I could.

494
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:53,615
Speaker 0: all right Yep, but yeah, and of course we met the people from indie spinner rack.

495
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:56,388
Speaker 1: Yep, the indie spinner at guys We also went to their dinner party.

496
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:57,897
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll talk about all those people later.

497
00:33:57,957 --> 00:34:00,043
Speaker 1: Yep We saw.

498
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:06,780
Speaker 1: I saw Sal Avenatti who makes this very pockner comic which I bought just as it's very pockner.

499
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:07,144
Speaker 1: I know.

500
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,500
Speaker 1: I'll gonna see if it's good or not after.

501
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,257
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is, but we really like these all the aesthetics and the mute everything about pockner.

502
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:18,867
Speaker 0: Well, maybe old pockner not so much new pockner older red pockner Being the Soviet Union.

503
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:21,719
Speaker 1: by the way, I really don't like communism.

504
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:26,755
Speaker 1: I just like hammers and sickles and red and yellow and that sort of stuff.

505
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:31,114
Speaker 0: remember that Mario communism That's that's so up our alley.

506
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:31,820
Speaker 0: It's kind of scary.

507
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,752
Speaker 1: I also don't know why I said like I didn't like this stuff before.

508
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,359
Speaker 1: I've only liked it in the past few years.

509
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,563
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is.

510
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:42,483
Speaker 0: I have a large collection of Soviet era choral music Let's see.

511
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:43,025
Speaker 1: I met.

512
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:46,699
Speaker 1: I'm trying to go around the room like the different ballrooms in my mind.

513
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,117
Speaker 1: I met Brian wood who writes DMZ.

514
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:55,856
Speaker 1: I met Cameron Stewart who draws the other side, which is this really great if you haven't read it.

515
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,160
Speaker 1: It's a vertigo book.

516
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,587
Speaker 1: It's just one book.

517
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,852
Speaker 1: You can read the whole story.

518
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:01,480
Speaker 1: It was like five or six issues.

519
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,494
Speaker 1: It's like this awesome new Vietnam War comic.

520
00:35:04,534 --> 00:35:05,740
Speaker 1: That is the highest quality.

521
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,207
Speaker 1: I recommend it to all.

522
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:08,433
Speaker 1: and this is the guy to the art.

523
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:08,875
Speaker 1: I met him.

524
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:10,000
Speaker 0: There's one artist now.

525
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:27,860
Speaker 0: I've never heard of her before and I don't think any of us had but in our group Pretty much almost every single person in the crew who was there independently of one another and without any sort of or coordination Found this artist talked to her and bought something from her and furthermore each one of us bought something different.

526
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:33,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, well some people just have an artistic style that really appeals to our group of people.

527
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:40,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Shelley Perline I'll put a link to her site in the the sites a little broken in Firefox, but I don't know I like her art.

528
00:35:40,627 --> 00:35:41,614
Speaker 0: So I guess I'll forgive that.

529
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,295
Speaker 1: Yep Let's see who else.

530
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:49,736
Speaker 1: oh There was a book that I bought called fun home by Alison Bechdel.

531
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:50,619
Speaker 1: I think that's how you say it.

532
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,348
Speaker 1: Oh, and it's like.

533
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,680
Speaker 1: it's not just like an award-winning comic.

534
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:58,031
Speaker 1: It's Time magazine's number one book of the year period.

535
00:35:58,353 --> 00:36:00,460
Speaker 1: right and I ordered it.

536
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,240
Speaker 1: I pre-ordered it and I got it at the beginning of the month and I still haven't read it.

537
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:16,389
Speaker 1: I don't know why but the person who writes and draws it was there that I saw her and I was like, hey Like I didn't have much to say because I didn't read her book yet Left the book at home.

538
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:23,740
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go through the list of all the stuff I bought but suffice to say I spent every single dollar I had and then I borrowed money from Scott.

539
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,028
Speaker 1: I actually regret not buying a few things like.

540
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:32,713
Speaker 1: there was a. there was one thing I wanted to buy this book called Sundays But it was really big and I didn't want to carry it.

541
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:43,200
Speaker 1: That's the only reason I didn't buy it Yeah, and there were a few other things like I didn't buy just because you know We sorta didn't stay there that long and we got there like an hour later than I wanted to get there.

542
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:44,900
Speaker 1: So yeah, well, what can you do?

543
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,560
Speaker 0: I got one thing that I'd really been wanting for a long time But that pyeongyang comic about the guy who goes and lives in North Korea for a while while he's working at an animation studio.

544
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, Emily had recommended it a bunch of times and there was there.

545
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:01,266
Speaker 0: so I bought it without hesitation and art boy Also bought it without hesitation.

546
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:01,829
Speaker 0: Yep.

547
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,680
Speaker 1: I read it just yesterday and it was quite the awesome.

548
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,551
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about it somewhat soon.

549
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,960
Speaker 1: Yep, maybe even next week.

550
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:10,308
Speaker 1: What else did I see there?

551
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,238
Speaker 1: It was just so much awesome stuff.

552
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:18,940
Speaker 1: Oh, right Um, I don't know if we've talked about it on the show, but last time we went we got these wooden ghosts, right?

553
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,212
Speaker 1: Yes, they were free these tiny little wooden pac-man they were.

554
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:22,935
Speaker 1: they were not.

555
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:25,348
Speaker 1: pac-man goes specifically But they're in the style of their.

556
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:30,978
Speaker 1: pac-man goes mine sitting right there Yeah, and we got these little ghosts for free But we had no idea who gave them to us.

557
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:37,280
Speaker 1: But sitting in the exact same position as last year was the guy who made them and he had more wooden things and I gave.

558
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:38,832
Speaker 1: I got his business card from him.

559
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:48,400
Speaker 1: He is Chris Yates chrisyates.net and If you want cool wooden sculpture things, he is the man.

560
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:56,260
Speaker 1: I went around his website and he had many many cool things Some of which I wanted but I did not buy because I have no use for a wooden thing like that.

561
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,440
Speaker 1: But maybe we could get him to make some sort of wooden geek knights figures or something.

562
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:01,583
Speaker 0: That'd be pretty cool.

563
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:02,145
Speaker 1: Think about it.

564
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:06,337
Speaker 1: sitting next to him was the wonder mark guy who we discovered at mocha last year.

565
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:11,011
Speaker 0: and ah Wonder mark is the rising star of webcomics as far as I'm concerned.

566
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy's pretty cool.

567
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,846
Speaker 1: I Forget his name.

568
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:16,984
Speaker 0: I Don't remember either.

569
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:18,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact for the longest time.

570
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:20,220
Speaker 0: I didn't even know it was called wonder mark.

571
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,067
Speaker 0: I just remembered poop jokes and top hat.

572
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:24,035
Speaker 1: That was the slogan that was on the bumper sticker.

573
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:28,640
Speaker 0: He gave you yeah Yeah, that pretty much describes everything about that comic.

574
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:31,228
Speaker 0: It is very literally poop jokes wearing top hats.

575
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,934
Speaker 1: one last thing is the.

576
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:42,009
Speaker 1: I think it was the Dutch Consulate was actually there and they had this big table with all sorts of Norwegian Fiti Swedish Finnish Swedish.

577
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna say swindling next finish in Swedish Comics there.

578
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:52,419
Speaker 0: I had to resist buying just piles of stuff from them and I just I ended up picking up this little brochure That was kind of cool.

579
00:38:52,501 --> 00:39:00,281
Speaker 0: it basically lists all the Finnish artists that were represented there and a little kind of sample of their art and a little explanation of what kind of things they Write.

580
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:11,353
Speaker 1: I actually paid $12 for this book called angst the best of Norwegian comics and it had a pic had some of Jason's art on the cover, you know, Jason is the awesome guy who did.

581
00:39:11,634 --> 00:39:13,000
Speaker 1: why are you doing this and all that?

582
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,207
Speaker 0: And the left bank gang.

583
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you read left bank yet?

584
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,347
Speaker 1: You bought it and I read it yesterday.

585
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:21,500
Speaker 1: That's I think that's gonna be like your favorite kind of action.

586
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:22,604
Speaker 0: I gotta ask one thing.

587
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:24,009
Speaker 0: Is it better or equal?

588
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,120
Speaker 0: better than or equal to why are you doing this?

589
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,680
Speaker 1: I would say that why are you doing this is probably it's tough call.

590
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:33,689
Speaker 1: Why are you doing this?

591
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,858
Speaker 1: I think is better for me.

592
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might better for you because it has some.

593
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:39,540
Speaker 1: you know, Sun Also Rises action.

594
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:43,175
Speaker 0: Oh, man, I'll probably get some hate for this but Scott knows me too.

595
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:47,811
Speaker 0: Well, the Sun Also Rises For whatever reason is one of my favorite books ever.

596
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:48,674
Speaker 0: It's pretty much that.

597
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:51,005
Speaker 0: and the Count of Monte Cristo You're gonna.

598
00:39:51,066 --> 00:39:55,951
Speaker 1: I think you're gonna like the left bank gang a little bit more Oh, but yeah, this angst comic basically just has.

599
00:39:56,051 --> 00:40:04,865
Speaker 1: it's like an anthology of a whole bunch of tiny comics by various northern European artists and Some of them are pretty awesome.

600
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:08,135
Speaker 1: Some of them are just kind of weird, but it was definitely worth my $12.

601
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:08,917
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

602
00:40:10,882 --> 00:40:11,846
Speaker 1: What else did we see there?

603
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,052
Speaker 1: a whole lot of stuff?

604
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:14,680
Speaker 1: It's like hard to recall all of it.

605
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:23,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have this pile of business cards in front of me in this pile of brochures and everything But I don't remember specifically which one goes with which cool thing I saw.

606
00:40:23,474 --> 00:40:25,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not always easy.

607
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,650
Speaker 1: I mean you had this giant room.

608
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,020
Speaker 1: you're walking around this ballroom.

609
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,771
Speaker 1: You see arts there arts over here arts over there.

610
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:33,080
Speaker 1: Some is cool some you don't care about so much.

611
00:40:33,663 --> 00:40:36,100
Speaker 1: You know, it seemed like it was kind of weird.

612
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,060
Speaker 1: The thing about this show is that I basically brought how many ten people there right last year?

613
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,651
Speaker 1: It was just you me and did anyone else go with us?

614
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:44,956
Speaker 0: Oh, we went with I do.

615
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:45,740
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.

616
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:49,714
Speaker 1: So it was you and me and eight other people this year had never been before.

617
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,260
Speaker 0: we brought a frickin posse.

618
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:54,530
Speaker 1: The people we brought weren't the biggest comic fans.

619
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,820
Speaker 1: I mean only me and Scott Johnson buy comics regularly.

620
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:58,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other people did.

621
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,360
Speaker 0: I mostly dislike the majority of comics, right?

622
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,656
Speaker 1: So you bring these people and I didn't tell you know, I didn't walk around with them saying oh, that's good.

623
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:08,869
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not good That's good.

624
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:15,740
Speaker 1: That's not good Right, and then you know when we left and when I met up with them later seeing what they had purchased.

625
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:18,273
Speaker 1: First of all, they bought more than I'd bought right.

626
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:25,542
Speaker 1: second of all They bought things that I knew and knew were good and probably would have told them to buy and things that were right up Their alley.

627
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:36,420
Speaker 1: a lot of them bought the same things and it was so it was pretty cool seeing like all these You know my friends buying all this stuff without me recommending that I would have recommended.

628
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:37,478
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

629
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:44,240
Speaker 0: If you live anywhere near New York City and you have any excuse to go the mocha is well worth four hours of your time.

630
00:41:44,681 --> 00:41:49,157
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah, I would like to go, you know for maybe five or six hours just so I can walk around.

631
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:52,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mocha itself is cool independent of that.

632
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:56,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to go to the mocha itself, you know, just check their website and it's mo CCA.

633
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,229
Speaker 1: Just search that on Google.

634
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,307
Speaker 1: You'll find it and Wait for them to have an exhibit you like.

635
00:42:01,348 --> 00:42:03,356
Speaker 1: I think the current exhibit is a Stan Lee exhibits.

636
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:07,936
Speaker 1: a rim doesn't want to go But they just I think they recently had a Todd McFarlane exhibit.

637
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:08,860
Speaker 1: That was higher quality.

638
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:13,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, if Stan Lee were a book he's definitely not on my he's not.

639
00:42:13,556 --> 00:42:14,600
Speaker 0: my son also arises.

640
00:42:16,582 --> 00:42:17,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could I was.

641
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:20,680
Speaker 0: I mean I'd make a bolding joke, but it's hard to do that with audio.

642
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:31,694
Speaker 1: But for anywhere in New York City and in I guess the month of June you kind of have to go to the mocha Arts Festival, I mean, it's nothing like, you know, the Comic Con you think about.

643
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:37,820
Speaker 1: there's barely any superhero action Even though there is some there and there are people who usually don't like any comics at all.

644
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:48,780
Speaker 1: But you walk around this place and no matter who you are even if you're a comic hater There'll be some sort of art on a table somewhere that'll appeal to you and you'll walk out spending a lot more money than you ever thought.

645
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:51,905
Speaker 1: Also an awesome thunder.

646
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:52,567
Speaker 0: All right.

647
00:42:52,587 --> 00:43:01,840
Speaker 0: I also want to point out briefly that they had concession stands like inside and They were so perfectly catered to the demographic that would be at this.

648
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:13,160
Speaker 0: They were basically selling nothing but energy drinks energy bars and like It was like soy and granola and energy bars and Red Bulls awesome and chocolate chip cookies.

649
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:14,124
Speaker 1: I didn't.

650
00:43:14,185 --> 00:43:15,531
Speaker 1: I didn't see the concession stand.

651
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,314
Speaker 1: So I did not buy.

652
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,620
Speaker 0: I was very thirsty.

653
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,767
Speaker 0: So I bought two Red Bulls.

654
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,055
Speaker 1: one thing that was different this year.

655
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:20,840
Speaker 1: That was a bad idea.

656
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:25,994
Speaker 1: Yeah, one thing that was different this year from last year Is that they they used to have the panels and I think the seventh floor right.

657
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:27,280
Speaker 1: or is it the 17th floor?

658
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:35,420
Speaker 1: I think it's the seventh floor and This year they moved the panels over to the actual mocha museum because remember this festival is in the puck building.

659
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:36,843
Speaker 0: We should probably cut this short.

660
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,066
Speaker 0: the Thunder's getting closer.

661
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:48,020
Speaker 1: I know we're gonna cut it short pretty soon and They instead added more table space on the seventh floor, which is awesome because it wasn't crowded up there as it was crowded downstairs.

662
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:49,600
Speaker 1: You could actually move around more freely.

663
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:54,725
Speaker 1: The Sun was shining into the room instead of it being dark like the other rooms And it was.

664
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:58,837
Speaker 1: I spent a lot of time up there just because it was so pleasant also And they kept.

665
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:00,605
Speaker 0: you know The elevators were kind that have really.

666
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:09,660
Speaker 0: they set up the elevator system to make sure people didn't get in other people's way and took the elevator efficiently Beautifully like props to them for keeping that under control.

667
00:44:10,012 --> 00:44:11,585
Speaker 1: Yeah I didn't have any problem at the elevator.

668
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:16,585
Speaker 0: every time I went by they said if you're brave you can go around the corner and Take the antique elevator.

669
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:20,360
Speaker 0: Ah, so I was up there with Emily and finally, you know, we hear that.

670
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,655
Speaker 0: So I'm like is there really an antique elevator?

671
00:44:22,675 --> 00:44:23,198
Speaker 0: and she's like, yeah.

672
00:44:23,681 --> 00:44:27,636
Speaker 0: So I go over there and there was the most awesome antique elevator.

673
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:28,479
Speaker 1: was there really?

674
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:32,392
Speaker 0: yes It was I didn't know super awesome and super old-school.

675
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:34,900
Speaker 0: it it's manually operated.

676
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:42,580
Speaker 0: So there was a guy dressed up in the finery Standing there who would let us in ask what floor we wanted to go to drive us there.

677
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:43,886
Speaker 0: He had a little stool.

678
00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:45,212
Speaker 0: He had his little water bottle under.

679
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:46,760
Speaker 1: that's how the Empire State Building works.

680
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,820
Speaker 1: If you go to the Empire State Building, there's a guy there's an elevator guy who operates the elevator.

681
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:57,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, but mostly to keep you from going to random floors and keep it going efficiently, but this was quite awesome.

682
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:00,989
Speaker 1: Yep Anything else we got to say about the other.

683
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:03,240
Speaker 0: the only thing we could really say is there was an after-party.

684
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:10,351
Speaker 0: I'm thinking since we've already gone a little bit long and there's a gigantic thunderstorm a-sailing our house that just this second It's about to come.

685
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:11,844
Speaker 0: Yep Maybe we'll talk about.

686
00:45:11,864 --> 00:45:15,802
Speaker 0: the after-party is a special or something since we need a bunch of filler for when we're out of town For Otakon.

687
00:45:15,823 --> 00:45:16,929
Speaker 1: There wasn't that much to say about.

688
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,600
Speaker 1: the after-party went to a Chinese restaurant.

689
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:19,544
Speaker 0: I got a bunch.

690
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:20,367
Speaker 0: we got some stories.

691
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:23,360
Speaker 0: I could definitely do a 15-minute thing about the after-party.

692
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, we saw it was run by the Indy spinner at guys.

693
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,220
Speaker 0: So if they do a podcast about independent comics Indy spinner rack calm I can figure out how to spell.

694
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,346
Speaker 1: I think it might be blog spot.

695
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:34,900
Speaker 1: I'm not sure you can search for it's Indy spinner rack calm.

696
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,426
Speaker 1: All right, the comic geek speak.

697
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:37,069
Speaker 1: guys were there.

698
00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:38,354
Speaker 1: a bunch of their listeners were there.

699
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:39,800
Speaker 1: a bunch of other cool people were there.

700
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,364
Speaker 1: It was generally cool.

701
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:43,470
Speaker 1: You should check out all those people's.

702
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:45,396
Speaker 0: the after-party was really fun.

703
00:45:45,737 --> 00:45:46,680
Speaker 0: The food was really good.

704
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:56,905
Speaker 1: There were some issues with the Knowledge of where the after-party took place and there were some issues with some other people besides us at the after-party getting adequate Food service.

705
00:45:57,186 --> 00:46:04,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we had a good time and it was actually it was funny that We brought our whole crew and we got there before everyone else.

706
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:09,519
Speaker 0: So we basically had this kind of dominating presence as all the real people who were running the party showed up.

707
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:14,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine, you know, it's like the people running the party sort of like, you know, you have a mixed table.

708
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,886
Speaker 1: I got a table and whatever.

709
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:17,051
Speaker 1: we'll talk about it some other time.
