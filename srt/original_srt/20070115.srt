1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,469
Speaker 1: It's Monday January 15th.

2
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:15,742
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and I'm rim and this is geek night Tonight.

3
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,427
Speaker 1: we teach you about content management system.

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,150
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:21,683
Speaker 1: You know what?

6
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:24,475
Speaker 1: I finally did today after a bunch of months of not doing it.

7
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,680
Speaker 0: Why what was that Scott?

8
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:29,112
Speaker 1: I got me a haircut just one just one.

9
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:31,280
Speaker 0: Ah, so you get the rest on next week.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,722
Speaker 0: I take it.

11
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,130
Speaker 1: perhaps it was.

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,779
Speaker 1: it was kind of expensive for just one.

13
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:40,057
Speaker 1: It's not so exciting when I get a haircut because I have short hair.

14
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:43,060
Speaker 1: Oh, I Know it's not a possessive thing.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,158
Speaker 1: I mean I could have any hair length I wanted but I keep my hair in a short style.

16
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:50,309
Speaker 0: for comfort I say you should grow the big Jew afro out.

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,040
Speaker 1: No, cuz I'll look like Einstein only without gray hair.

18
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,625
Speaker 0: No, not so much.

19
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:57,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, just a poof like like an Einstein.

20
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:59,220
Speaker 1: It's an Einstein if I let it go.

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,245
Speaker 0: Why don't you let it go?

22
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,109
Speaker 0: They'd be kind of awesome.

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,335
Speaker 1: No wouldn't be awesome.

24
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,320
Speaker 1: It'd be kind of silly.

25
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,680
Speaker 0: Why you'd stand out in a crowd?

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's bad.

27
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,993
Speaker 1: We're standing out for that reason.

28
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:09,119
Speaker 1: It's much works.

29
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:13,214
Speaker 1: I know it's much more exciting if rim gets a haircut because he hasn't cut his hair in forever.

30
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,860
Speaker 1: Well, not significantly.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,144
Speaker 0: No, I get haircuts often.

32
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:19,234
Speaker 1: I mean my hair was yeah, but you don't get your hair short.

33
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:20,618
Speaker 1: It's remains long.

34
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:21,320
Speaker 0: God my hair.

35
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,288
Speaker 0: I don't think I'll ever cut my hair long.

36
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,734
Speaker 0: in fact cut my hair short.

37
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:27,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, uh, Wasn't that long ago?

38
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,780
Speaker 0: We're having a party and our good friend Conrad was here.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,092
Speaker 0: He's trying to convince me that within a few years.

40
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,398
Speaker 0: I'm gonna cut all my hair off.

41
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,607
Speaker 1: Maybe if someone drugs you.

42
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:40,119
Speaker 0: well, but if someone drug me and cut it off forcibly That's the only way I could see it happening.

43
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:44,635
Speaker 1: Someone drugs you and you're so deranged that you do it and you think you're not doing it.

44
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

45
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:49,782
Speaker 0: I think I'd be more likely to I don't know go on a killing spree or something Perhaps.

46
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,559
Speaker 0: but anyway more importantly today is Martin Luther King jr.

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,719
Speaker 0: Day But apparently I'm the only person in the world to get the day off work.

48
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't I did but I had.

49
00:01:59,197 --> 00:02:00,925
Speaker 1: a Reason is that I go.

50
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:01,669
Speaker 0: I had no idea.

51
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,236
Speaker 0: I got the day off until just recently.

52
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:09,235
Speaker 0: I know school I've been to elementary middle junior high college whatever ever gave the day off.

53
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,759
Speaker 0: the garbage collection came.

54
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,714
Speaker 0: Anyway, the railroad didn't count it as a holiday.

55
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,020
Speaker 1: Did the garbage collection come?

56
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,750
Speaker 0: I assume it did because I don't think they'd recognize that holiday.

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,483
Speaker 0: Well, we better go outside and Jake there were peak trains Everything.

58
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:24,849
Speaker 0: it wasn't even a holiday.

59
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:27,320
Speaker 0: I just happened to get the day off which is kind of annoying.

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,651
Speaker 0: I'd rather would have gone to work and gotten a different day off.

61
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:33,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, I technically didn't go to work Get the day off, but I didn't go to work.

62
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just ran off into Manhattan.

63
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:36,760
Speaker 0: Just have some dinner with Emily.

64
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:37,523
Speaker 1: That's good.

65
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,508
Speaker 0: I got some good Thai food.

66
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,219
Speaker 0: considering we got gypped on our Thai food over the weekend.

67
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,440
Speaker 1: That guy did not know how to figure out like how many seats he had.

68
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:52,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the proprietors of the Sukkotai in downtown beacon happen to listen to geek nights You need more confident front-end staff.

69
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:56,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should know at all times what the weight will be for any number of people.

70
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:03,060
Speaker 0: You see I don't even care if they just say, you know I don't know how long the weights gonna be or you'll just have to wait and see that'd be fine.

71
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta say something.

72
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:08,681
Speaker 0: I don't need you to lie to me and I don't need you to spend five minutes coming up with A lie.

73
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:09,163
Speaker 1: Yep.

74
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:20,933
Speaker 1: Just tell me whatever you can right away instead of making me stand there and waiting for you to say something Yeah, and then saying yeah, it'll be 15 minutes and it won't be Especially when the barbecue place down the street was empty.

75
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,280
Speaker 0: we could have eaten there immediately.

76
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could but I didn't really want to eat there so badly.

77
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:32,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah So we didn't talk about it last week since we wanted to make sure all the details were out.

78
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,496
Speaker 0: but now I think it's safe to talk about the fact that Probably the most important announcement of all the Apple and CES whatnot was simply the iPhone.

79
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,054
Speaker 2: Oh great We have a phone.

80
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:43,377
Speaker 1: tada.

81
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:49,200
Speaker 0: Well, one thing that I think would say the most about how I feel about this is that in Japan?

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,559
Speaker 0: No one gives one shit about this phone.

83
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:56,280
Speaker 2: Yeah Well what the iPhone really comes down to is that phones and especially in the u.s.

84
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,340
Speaker 1: Suck ass and it's mostly the fault of the carriers and not the fault of technology not being advanced enough.

85
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:09,200
Speaker 0: Yeah The individual phones have a lot of power in them and it's not at all difficult to put cool features or nice things in phones.

86
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:10,860
Speaker 0: But the carriers want to make money.

87
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:15,973
Speaker 0: So the phone has a camera But they want to charge you five bucks a month to be able to get pictures off of it.

88
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:25,060
Speaker 0: or the phone has a Bluetooth But you won't want you to pay extra or they just don't want you to even have access to it And they only want you to be able to get your address book off of it, but not put ringtones on it.

89
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:30,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the other problem of course, is that the people who make the phones and the phone operating systems?

90
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:40,039
Speaker 1: they you know don't really give a shit about the interface on your phone because 99% of people just make phone calls and do text messages and maybe take a picture.

91
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:45,780
Speaker 1: and You know, you don't really need a fancy to develop a better user interface for that sort of thing.

92
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,482
Speaker 1: No one cares.

93
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:52,400
Speaker 1: and the smartphones are mostly used by business users who get used to whatever you give their company buys them.

94
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,992
Speaker 1: So you don't need a better interface to sell something to a company.

95
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:56,680
Speaker 1: You just need better security and whatever.

96
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,797
Speaker 0: So the iPhone is just another one of these smartphones.

97
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:07,459
Speaker 2: basically Well, it's technically not a smartphone because the term smartphone means something specific to some people.

98
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:07,880
Speaker 1: whatever.

99
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:14,107
Speaker 1: It's a PDA plus a phone Plus a camera plus.

100
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,614
Speaker 1: Yeah plus a camera maybe not even a camera.

101
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:18,660
Speaker 0: most people when they use the word smartphone a video.

102
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:19,724
Speaker 1: It's an iPod.

103
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:21,349
Speaker 0: maybe most people smartphone.

104
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:22,473
Speaker 0: They just think a PDA.

105
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,240
Speaker 0: that were they basically picture a blackberry.

106
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,665
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I picture also.

107
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:28,576
Speaker 1: It's a phone and a PDA and an iPod in one device.

108
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,987
Speaker 2: now What's good about the iPhone?

109
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:34,000
Speaker 1: the user interface is awesome, or at least it looks awesome.

110
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,271
Speaker 1: I don't know who's used it yet.

111
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,199
Speaker 1: Do you know anyone who's used it?

112
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, considering it's not out and it's not gonna be out for many months Well supposedly some technology journalists have gotten to use it and I'm sure people at Apple have used it.

113
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:49,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's definitely better than anything I've ever seen on a handheld device.

114
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,028
Speaker 0: However, it has some significant drawbacks.

115
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:55,320
Speaker 0: It costs a lot of money for what you get now.

116
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,165
Speaker 2: Granted phones like.

117
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:59,693
Speaker 1: you know the price of an iPod right.

118
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:01,860
Speaker 1: that's that quality plus a phone.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,633
Speaker 1: That's that quality plus a PDA.

120
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,520
Speaker 1: That's that quality.

121
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,559
Speaker 1: You're kind of getting a deal.

122
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:12,020
Speaker 0: But at the same time the same sense that a PlayStation 3 is a deal because it comes with a blu-ray player.

123
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:23,069
Speaker 1: Yeah at the same time while the iPhone is like $600 you could get like the Motorola Q for a hundred dollars And iPhones not that much better than it.

124
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:27,265
Speaker 0: Also the iPhones battery less Not so long.

125
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:36,660
Speaker 1: Well, it's not that the problem with the battery doesn't last so long is kind of bad You know, I think it lasts five hours of calling and video watching and whatever.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,880
Speaker 1: But the big problem is that like on all other Apple products, you can't change the battery.

127
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,791
Speaker 1: So I mean that's on an iPod.

128
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:50,732
Speaker 1: not being able to change the battery kind of sucks But it's not so bad because it lasts a really long time.

129
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,122
Speaker 1: and if your iPod runs out of battery Oh, no.

130
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,787
Speaker 1: Well, what if you listen to music on a flight?

131
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:17,229
Speaker 1: That's like a five-hour flight and After listening to music for five hours your battery's dead and now you can't make a phone call like that really sucks is when you know You do one thing watching video or listening to music and it kills off your ability to make phone calls or take pictures And that that's kind of bad.

132
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:22,936
Speaker 0: now plus all this there's the issue with Cisco who claims to have the.

133
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,971
Speaker 0: They have rights to the name iPhone and oh, whatever.

134
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,877
Speaker 1: There's so much conflicting news on that.

135
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,660
Speaker 1: I just don't give a shit.

136
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,247
Speaker 1: It's all silly.

137
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's going back and forth.

138
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,060
Speaker 0: I imagine that Apple was fully aware of this and they're using it possibly as a free publicity marketing toy or a marketing tool.

139
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Speaker 0: But in the end the impression I get is that after the initial buzz among all the Mac fanatics about the iPhone Coverage of it pretty much disappeared from my internet in terms of the sites I go to and there's been no more news about it.

140
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Speaker 1: It was like this huge outburst of OMG to iPhone and then quiet and I think this is actually the reason why Apple likes to Announce their products the day before they come out that way.

141
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,465
Speaker 1: There's a huge burst of news and then while that burst is still going strong people buy the product now Because what they want.

142
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:10,275
Speaker 1: they had to submit this because it's a phone to the FCC.

143
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,900
Speaker 1: when the FCC gets a submission They put it on the internet.

144
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:23,920
Speaker 1: So if Apple didn't announce the iPhone We would have found out about it from the FCC and Apple would rather tell us about it from you know At their keynote then have us find out about it on the FCC website.

145
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,412
Speaker 1: So they announced it early.

146
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:27,600
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be out until June.

147
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:43,400
Speaker 1: So now there's a huge explosion of news and then there's gonna be this quiet time where people actually have time to think about purchasing the Apple product instead of just buying it on instinct because it looks so cool at the keynote yesterday and that Might not, you know do the trick for Apple.

148
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:48,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, honestly, I don't think the iPhone is going to do very well, but that is my.

149
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:52,244
Speaker 1: well He's not the first iPhone, you know It doesn't help that.

150
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:57,288
Speaker 1: the opinion of a lot of people in this country is that they want a phone that just makes calls and Doesn't do anything else.

151
00:08:57,308 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 0: Well considering that I'm one of those people I always will take whatever phone is free with whatever plan I've got and I'll sign a Contract for one or two or whatever years just so I'll get a free phone.

152
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:18,826
Speaker 1: Yep, the other thing is that a lot of the people who would make you know The use of all the features on this phone like college kids and teens and 20-somethings Probably can't afford this phone.

153
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:31,160
Speaker 1: and the business people that can't afford this phone can't use this phone because it doesn't Support all the things that business people need like installing Java applications or getting mail from exchange servers Lotus or whatever.

154
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just you know.

155
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:39,580
Speaker 1: Blackberry for all you know It's problems is really awesome at getting email better than any other portable device.

156
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,472
Speaker 1: And while the interface for the email might be better on the iPhone.

157
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:52,346
Speaker 1: the actual, you know Working of the email on the Blackberry is beyond compare from anything I've ever seen, you know now that I think about it Despite all my technological leanings.

158
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:56,140
Speaker 0: I have had exactly three cell phones in my entire life.

159
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,551
Speaker 0: The first one was the size of a brick and lasted an hour.

160
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:05,771
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had that when I was in high school Yep, then I got my own my first real like cell phone.

161
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,835
Speaker 0: That was purely mine.

162
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:13,440
Speaker 0: It wasn't just shared with my mom Was the one I used up until it broke while I was on co-op for IBM Yep.

163
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:21,511
Speaker 0: And then when I went back to IBM the second time when that phone broke is when I got the third phone which I'm still Using to this day and will probably use for another several years.

164
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:22,194
Speaker 0: Yes, I break it.

165
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:23,600
Speaker 1: I just got my third phone.

166
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,036
Speaker 1: I had the star tack and then I had that Samsung whatever which I still have but I'm not using.

167
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,442
Speaker 1: and now I have the LG.

168
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,202
Speaker 0: yeah, I remember your first cell phone sucked The L.

169
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:35,474
Speaker 1: that the Motorola star tech is actually an awesome freaking phone.

170
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:40,512
Speaker 1: if you want a phone that just makes calls I mean when that phone came out, it was the razor of its time.

171
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,600
Speaker 1: It was thin thinner than anything else.

172
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,230
Speaker 1: It was really reliable.

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,900
Speaker 1: It always got a great signal.

174
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:50,519
Speaker 1: It didn't do anything but make calls, but it made fucking calls.

175
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember there being an issue.

176
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:57,133
Speaker 0: if you didn't hold the mouth part in the exact right space It was almost impossible to hear you talking.

177
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,019
Speaker 1: I don't remember that.

178
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,515
Speaker 0: Well, cuz you weren't the one being called by stuff.

179
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:00,938
Speaker 1: shit for you.

180
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:09,539
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think the iPhone, you know the initial one a lot of the super Apple fans with lots of money like all day.

181
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:12,700
Speaker 1: You know hip Silicon Valley people will buy one, you know.

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,279
Speaker 1: And maybe a few companies who use a lot of Apple products will be able to buy one.

183
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,668
Speaker 1: But other than that, you're not gonna see a whole.

184
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:23,999
Speaker 1: you're not gonna see Apple's predicted one in a hundred people getting it.

185
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:31,780
Speaker 1: They expect 1% market share which isn't shooting too far but it's not shooting too low either.

186
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,005
Speaker 0: I don't know if I were Apple.

187
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,139
Speaker 0: I don't think this is the right time at all to be bringing out a product like this.

188
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,108
Speaker 1: Oh, I think the time is right.

189
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,860
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people in this country are upset with their phones.

190
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

191
00:11:42,325 --> 00:11:46,380
Speaker 0: Are they really gonna pay Spain this amount of money to move to singular?

192
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, as the other problem is, you know having only on one carrier I mean Apple has always made a product.

193
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:57,493
Speaker 1: Well, the reason the iPod did so well is that anyone can have an iPod.

194
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,826
Speaker 1: it the iPod didn't really take off until they had iTunes for Windows.

195
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:08,460
Speaker 1: without iTunes for Windows the iPod would be in the shitter It wouldn't be doing very well at all and all these non iPod players would be doing a lot better than they are.

196
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:18,030
Speaker 1: So by having a singular only that's gonna really hold them back because there's probably a lot of people who want iPhones who were in areas where singular doesn't have service.

197
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,856
Speaker 1: See it's not why singular.

198
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:22,486
Speaker 0: if they had gone with Sprint Or Verizon it would've been fine.

199
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:26,360
Speaker 1: That's because we live in a Sprint Verizon area, which is the vast majority of this country.

200
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,965
Speaker 1: Well, it's mostly the Northeast.

201
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:32,440
Speaker 0: actually there are very few places that get singular and don't get Sprint Verizon.

202
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:35,040
Speaker 1: It's true, but they're it's sort of a different thing.

203
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:41,499
Speaker 1: The real problem here right is that this phone does a lot of internetting and web browsing, but they only included edge.

204
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Speaker 1: They didn't include HSD PA.

205
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,780
Speaker 1: so it's gonna be slow.

206
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:48,088
Speaker 1: I mean it has this fancy Safari web browser.

207
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,305
Speaker 1: that web browser is gonna be slower than the one of my shitty LG phone that I just got.

208
00:12:52,668 --> 00:12:56,468
Speaker 1: well shitty compared to the iPhone It's not really shitty, but think about that.

209
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:59,779
Speaker 1: the $600 phone browses the web slower than I.

210
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,992
Speaker 0: guess That you'll use the Wi-Fi capability and hook up to hotspots.

211
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:06,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do that with your laptop.

212
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,382
Speaker 1: Exactly.

213
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:09,411
Speaker 1: if this Wi-Fi I can freakin sit down.

214
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:10,877
Speaker 1: What do I I mean?

215
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:11,640
Speaker 1: Wi-Fi on the phone?

216
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:20,340
Speaker 1: I agree is useful, but yeah, the other thing is that this thing has Bluetooth But you still need to use a wire to connect it to a computer to get songs.

217
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,839
Speaker 1: You can't have podcast download directly to it.

218
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,800
Speaker 1: It doesn't have iTunes running on it.

219
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,086
Speaker 1: You need if you get to want to buy music you got to buy it and then put it on there with a cable a USB Cable just like you do a normal iPod.

220
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:31,889
Speaker 1: What the hell.

221
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,855
Speaker 1: the PSP which is cheaper.

222
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:39,357
Speaker 0: believe that in fact We have a lot of listeners using the PSP relative to how many SPS there are in the world.

223
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:48,680
Speaker 1: PSP Which is cheaper than the iPhone and Has an equivalent screen can download podcasts directly over Wi-Fi and subscribe to them and everything.

224
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,679
Speaker 1: You don't need to plug it into a computer shit.

225
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:55,839
Speaker 1: So if the iPhone which is like three times the cost of the PSP can't do that kind of said.

226
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,419
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think there's not much more to say about the iPhone.

227
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:02,960
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we'll say something when it actually comes out or when Apple announces the changes.

228
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,448
Speaker 0: That'll make it a little bit more palatable.

229
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, hopefully if they announce any changes I imagine that we're gonna be waiting for the iPhone nano.

230
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:13,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean in general I just get the sense that a lot of people Were.

231
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,320
Speaker 0: I mean people were rabid about the idea of an Apple phone for years and years and years and it is it's very sexy.

232
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:23,340
Speaker 0: Every year they were just salivate about the possible rumors of yeah, Apple's gonna definitely do it this year.

233
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,129
Speaker 0: No, they're definitely gonna do it this year.

234
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,777
Speaker 1: And then they finally did it.

235
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:27,220
Speaker 0: everyone went.

236
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:37,280
Speaker 1: Oh a lot of people are still going But those are the people who you know aren't harmed by the deficiencies of the product.

237
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,025
Speaker 0: Well, it's not just that.

238
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,400
Speaker 0: I think there aren't that many people doing that.

239
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,650
Speaker 0: It's just the people doing that are loud and on the Apple rumor sites.

240
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,075
Speaker 1: Well, we'll find out in June.

241
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:45,997
Speaker 0: We will.

242
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,810
Speaker 1: we will indeed All right.

243
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,719
Speaker 1: I got a short news.

244
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:51,266
Speaker 1: There's someone named Louise Brown.

245
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,200
Speaker 1: She was the first test tube baby in the entire world.

246
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:03,667
Speaker 1: she was the first person ever to be conceived conceived by IVF and She just had a baby the normal way.

247
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,553
Speaker 0: Wow so much for coordinators.

248
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:06,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, isn't that kind of?

249
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:07,840
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty cool.

250
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,179
Speaker 0: I think it's a testament to how far we've come.

251
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,715
Speaker 1: She looks like she's living an average American life, but you know, just a normal person not special or anything.

252
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:17,220
Speaker 1: But hey, that's pretty cool.

253
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:25,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean we were actually talking about this over the weekend Which was actually a meta conversation after a bunch of us listened to an episode of our own show.

254
00:15:25,664 --> 00:15:27,760
Speaker 0: Really yeah the Parthenon thing.

255
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:41,584
Speaker 0: Oh that yeah about how compared to the vast Vast majority of human existence compared to the great great majority of every human that has ever lived on this earth as far as we Know we are gods All right.

256
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:42,287
Speaker 1: So think about this.

257
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,560
Speaker 1: they made a person and a test tube.

258
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,920
Speaker 1: Yes And then that person was born and they remembered they wrote down what person that was and they knew about that person.

259
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:57,017
Speaker 1: That person knew who she was and then that person had a baby at the age of 28 pretty recently.

260
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:11,920
Speaker 1: Yeah Take this baby talk to that person and they took pictures of that baby and that person and now We have them on the internet and we can read them and talk about them on a podcast If you record and distribute to you over the same Internet's.

261
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:20,110
Speaker 0: We've come a long way from traveling 12 miles to market and then 12 miles back and that Consisted of the majority of your summer.

262
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:30,420
Speaker 1: That's why technologies are awesome things of the day.

263
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:32,199
Speaker 1: What you got over there?

264
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,165
Speaker 0: Alright, so I had a couple.

265
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:42,920
Speaker 0: like I always do I was looking through things of the day and I found one to trump All of them and I believe the only thing that could trump it is my thing of the day for tomorrow.

266
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:46,140
Speaker 0: So I figured I got to put him in the proper order.

267
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,626
Speaker 0: I mean you can't put it'd be like what riding the best roller coaster in the world then trying to have fun on the second Best roller coaster in the world.

268
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:57,119
Speaker 1: It's not exactly you got to ride the small roller coaster And then the big one or else it doesn't work.

269
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:57,905
Speaker 1: You just buy this.

270
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,059
Speaker 1: if you're gonna do that just ride the big one and go home.

271
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:09,835
Speaker 0: So of the two clips from Japanese television Japanese television close watch out Now, I'm sure you all remember an old show called Takeshi's challenge known in the u.s.

272
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:11,200
Speaker 0: As most extreme challenge.

273
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:23,160
Speaker 0: Yep, it was one of those shows where it's Japanese people being forced to undergo Incredible tests of strength and feats of dexterity often involving severe injury and humorous consequences.

274
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:29,680
Speaker 0: Well, this is a little bit beyond that and it's not, you know, normal Japanese people being thrust into these situations.

275
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:45,014
Speaker 0: It's Japanese people who are experts at things like gold medalist gymnasts and athletes And really people who are very much at the top of their form and it's a lot like American gladiators Except that I don't think a single American gladiator could even come close to man.

276
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:46,640
Speaker 2: American gladiators is so awesome.

277
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,332
Speaker 0: I'm actually haters was one of the best shows on TV.

278
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,120
Speaker 2: the best part was the best part American gladiators.

279
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:53,100
Speaker 2: It's the one where they got shooting the tennis balls.

280
00:17:53,163 --> 00:18:00,800
Speaker 0: Yes and you had to go from station to station with those little guns and try to shoot the target and I always got pissed because Most people couldn't shoot for crap.

281
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,704
Speaker 2: They just kept missing.

282
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:05,300
Speaker 2: and I was like, how can you not hit that giant red thing with the rocket launcher?

283
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,879
Speaker 2: The rocket launcher is so accurate and said shot so far without any physical effort.

284
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:18,206
Speaker 0: Well, remember most people are more afraid of those tennis balls than they are worried about hitting the thing because the thing can run out Tennis balls, so you're more.

285
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:26,520
Speaker 0: what you want to do is just avoid enough tennis balls to get close enough to lob the grenade I think is the gladiators are too smart and they'll never run out of tennis balls after they shoot enough at you.

286
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,734
Speaker 2: They won't shoot unless they think they got a good shot.

287
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:29,579
Speaker 0: I saw it happen once.

288
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,965
Speaker 2: Yeah, it has happened.

289
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,053
Speaker 2: But most of the gladiators are too smart to you God.

290
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:34,720
Speaker 0: We got to do a show on American gladiators.

291
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,607
Speaker 0: Shit, all right cuz think we could cut.

292
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:37,992
Speaker 0: we could do American gladiators week.

293
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:39,518
Speaker 2: No, no, no.

294
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:46,940
Speaker 0: on Tuesday We talk about the game American gladiators Monday Monday, we talk about the technology behind American gladiators.

295
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,424
Speaker 2: What technology was there?

296
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:52,577
Speaker 2: people running and jumping in ropes and platforms and tennis ball shooters?

297
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,980
Speaker 0: Yeah tennis ball Yeah, we could stretch that into at least.

298
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,047
Speaker 0: Anyway American gladiators is crap.

299
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,280
Speaker 0: the new hotness and I guess it's not that new is the show in Japan.

300
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,833
Speaker 0: I didn't do any research.

301
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:05,680
Speaker 0: I don't know what the show is.

302
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:13,360
Speaker 0: all I know is that these are clips of the best contender on the show ever Nagano and his amazing prowess.

303
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:23,660
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean once you see what this guy is doing you say, okay Let's replace the decathlon with that and then we'll know who's the best.

304
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,330
Speaker 0: I mean really I think this should be an Olympic event.

305
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,680
Speaker 0: you set up one of these things secretly.

306
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:34,731
Speaker 0: Maybe you give people a list of types of things that could be in it And then just whoever gets the furthest gets the gold medal.

307
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:35,112
Speaker 1: Yep.

308
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:39,740
Speaker 2: You have a big obstacle course and You know, you know, it's an obstacle course.

309
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,262
Speaker 2: they have to get to the end without falling off and You just

310
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:44,727
Speaker 1: build it in a room

311
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:52,673
Speaker 2: and some court sort of building and you have the athletes come in one at a time To do it and after they're done They have to stay in there until everyone else is done.

312
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:55,619
Speaker 2: and then you you know You videotape the whole thing, of course.

313
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:59,736
Speaker 2: And then when everyone's done you send them all home and then you put it on TV.

314
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:05,100
Speaker 2: that way, you know There's no advantage of knowing the obstacles beforehand, but watch this video.

315
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:08,640
Speaker 0: I mean some of these things aren't even just interesting they're downright cruel.

316
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:14,140
Speaker 0: It's like alright, he's already tasked with something that I could not do and likely will never be able to do.

317
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:19,896
Speaker 0: It is something that looks very painful and difficult and then they also make it go like up and down.

318
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:25,974
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's just it's too much and this guy does it just easily.

319
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,361
Speaker 2: I think this guy could probably beat the Prince of Persia Easily.

320
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:31,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, he might be able to.

321
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:31,930
Speaker 2: I think he could.

322
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,696
Speaker 0: we'll have to save him for Thunderdome.

323
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:47,439
Speaker 2: Oh, wow alright, so There's a. this is animation studio called Frederator Studios and you know, they have a podcast little animations They make and there's a TV channel called Nickelodeon and you should probably know about them.

324
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:55,040
Speaker 2: And anyway, they combined to create this seven minute little random cartoon animation called adventure time.

325
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,189
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what I can say about this.

326
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,330
Speaker 2: My sister showed it to me like oh you got to see this Ah, and she was all excited about it.

327
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,256
Speaker 2: Like she was quoting it.

328
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:06,392
Speaker 2: She was like Algebraic Rhombus and I was like the medical.

329
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was totally mad.

330
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,869
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was like, uh, whatever.

331
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,499
Speaker 2: and then she showed it to me and I was like WTF mate.

332
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,643
Speaker 2: And well Here it is.

333
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,009
Speaker 2: So you can suffer watching it.

334
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:20,479
Speaker 0: Also, I really don't know what to say.

335
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:24,040
Speaker 0: Other than that, I'm disappointed that the drum set did not come into play.

336
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:28,918
Speaker 2: That's what I was wondering cuz I when I watched it at my parents house My sister showed it to me.

337
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:36,222
Speaker 2: I kind of stopped watching when the drum set appeared and I assumed the drum set would come into play and it did not and I Was very disappointed.

338
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:40,454
Speaker 2: But yeah, if you like, you know weird animations.

339
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:43,322
Speaker 0: if you are in desperate need of a catchphrase This is for you.

340
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,648
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, this will get you a catchphrase right quick.

341
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,673
Speaker 2: Also rainicorns.

342
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:52,408
Speaker 0: I Love when the dogs flirting with the rainicorn.

343
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,793
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a good part.

344
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:54,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

345
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:55,339
Speaker 2: That's probably the only good part

346
00:21:57,002 --> 00:22:12,800
Speaker 0: Right, so this might sound like a somewhat esoteric topic but it actually relates to a lot more of you out there than you might think because many times our friends or just people who Listen to the show will ask us questions that basically the answer to any of those questions is always use a CMS.

347
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,349
Speaker 0: So tonight we're gonna talk a bit about content management systems.

348
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,400
Speaker 2: No, we're not gonna get into details about specific content management systems.

349
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,404
Speaker 2: We'll mention a few.

350
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:30,800
Speaker 2: but we're not gonna like go over a list of content management systems and tell you you know The pros and cons of using each one and when in what situations one is better than the other.

351
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,246
Speaker 2: That's for another time.

352
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:35,117
Speaker 2: Plus we haven't used that many content management systems.

353
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:36,243
Speaker 0: I've used 1.5.

354
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:42,573
Speaker 2: I've used Three and a half the maybe three and a quarter.

355
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,800
Speaker 2: So we're not really qualified to do that.

356
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:57,160
Speaker 0: No But a lot of people have problems mostly involving making websites and they they try to solve these problems The same way that we would have solved them in 1994.

357
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,731
Speaker 0: Exactly, and the world is well no 96.

358
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,037
Speaker 2: there weren't websites in 94.

359
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:01,740
Speaker 1: Well, he's not for us.

360
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,224
Speaker 1: There weren't websites for us in 90.

361
00:23:03,224 --> 00:23:04,608
Speaker 0: No, but there were websites.

362
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:05,009
Speaker 1: there were.

363
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:07,055
Speaker 0: I was learning HTML in 1994.

364
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:07,116
Speaker 0: No.

365
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:10,547
Speaker 0: Wow Yeah, well HTML what all.

366
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,820
Speaker 0: one day someone was talking about HTML in my school.

367
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,787
Speaker 0: I was like, isn't that the thing block like?

368
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,373
Speaker 0: I didn't know much about it me either.

369
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:21,040
Speaker 0: and he enlightened me with this very simple Statement it's real easy.

370
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:24,539
Speaker 0: If you want something to be bold you just put B's on either side of it.

371
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,009
Speaker 0: You know B starts it and a slash B ends it.

372
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,998
Speaker 0: and I was like other things other than bold.

373
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:30,646
Speaker 0: and he's like, yeah There's a thing for everything.

374
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,295
Speaker 0: and I thought oh that's simple.

375
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:38,320
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, so anyway, let's start talking about the way it used to be in.

376
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:41,700
Speaker 1: You know, why do we need a content management system and what one does?

377
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let's say you've got something you want to put on the internet some sort of website information.

378
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,785
Speaker 1: Well now if you want to make a web page a single page then if it's today or if it's 1997 you do it the same way.

379
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:55,290
Speaker 1: you write HTML.

380
00:23:55,691 --> 00:24:08,394
Speaker 1: Well, I guess nowadays you also write a cascading style sheet, but that doesn't matter and You put it on a web server and then if someone visits your web server It sends them the page you wrote and their web browser draws it.

381
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,910
Speaker 0: if you want to change that page You just have to edit it and upload a new one.

382
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:12,935
Speaker 1: Yep, that it's.

383
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:13,800
Speaker 1: it was pretty simple.

384
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,323
Speaker 1: It's simple.

385
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:15,288
Speaker 1: now is simple then.

386
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:19,005
Speaker 0: but let's say you want to do regular content Like you want to make a webcomic.

387
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:29,060
Speaker 1: you want to make a website a site with a lot of pages and the pages link to Each other and there's stuff on the pages and there's a lot of different URLs that people can type in to get to different pages.

388
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:35,305
Speaker 0: Yep, so now in the old days you would either make a whole bunch of different pages Yeah You would make one web page.

389
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,550
Speaker 1: that looked a certain way.

390
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,040
Speaker 1: then you would copy that entire page and then Manually edit the parts.

391
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,940
Speaker 1: That would be different and then you would have to modify the other pages to make the links to the new page.

392
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:51,100
Speaker 0: So if you ever added a page to your site You had to go to all your other pages and add the link to it.

393
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:54,060
Speaker 1: It was pretty painful depending on how you designed your website.

394
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,927
Speaker 0: So out of this came things like frames.

395
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:59,660
Speaker 0: frames are bad, but the thing is frames solved that problem.

396
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,339
Speaker 1: They solved the problem a little bit.

397
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:13,197
Speaker 0: Well, what frames did is you could have one web page that was open in a frame us on the screen And then that web page could then through it links on it open web pages in other frames.

398
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:26,740
Speaker 0: so you could have a Navigation frame that linked to all your pages and then whenever you wanted to add content to your main site You'd make a new page and then you just put a link to that page in your navigation frame or something along those lines.

399
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't a total solution.

400
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:34,120
Speaker 1: It made life a little easier for web developers and it made life a lot harder for web browsers.

401
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:46,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, also for web developers it wasn't the greatest because a lot of people didn't really understand how to use frames and The design was shitty and a lot of people used frames poorly and they're also not good.

402
00:25:46,157 --> 00:25:47,080
Speaker 0: They're not very extensible.

403
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:51,160
Speaker 0: No, so I guess the look at the example of a webcomic because it's the easiest one.

404
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,626
Speaker 0: We can just use that as our metaphor.

405
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:53,068
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

406
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,680
Speaker 0: So you've got this website with your webcomic on it.

407
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:04,240
Speaker 0: So you've got a bunch of pages, you know Like my biography about the characters links to my friend web comics how to get a hold of me how to buy my stuff.

408
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:08,197
Speaker 0: Additionally, you're constantly adding new content to the site.

409
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,460
Speaker 1: every day You're uploading a new picture to the website and that picture needs its own page.

410
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,209
Speaker 1: It needs to also go on the front page.

411
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,260
Speaker 0: It also needs to be part of your navigation.

412
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:21,424
Speaker 0: So if someone's going through the archives they can read all of these pictures in order Mm-hmm.

413
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:28,800
Speaker 0: in the old days You would make all of these pages Individually and just keep updating in each one to add links to the previous one in the last one.

414
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,636
Speaker 1: So every day you would modify the front page.

415
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:32,280
Speaker 1: you would mod.

416
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,951
Speaker 1: You would make a brand new page for that comic itself.

417
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:37,160
Speaker 1: You would modify your archives page.

418
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,932
Speaker 1: You would rewrite your whole news post in HTML.

419
00:26:40,972 --> 00:26:42,316
Speaker 1: You would be writing HTML you.

420
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:43,520
Speaker 1: you couldn't just write it.

421
00:26:43,781 --> 00:27:00,213
Speaker 1: You had to also be thinking about the HTML and what you are writing at the same time Even if you're using a cascading style sheet, so you don't have to worry about the style of what you're writing You still have to constantly be going like P at the beginning of the paragraph Slash P at the end of the paragraph whenever you make a link.

422
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:01,520
Speaker 1: you had to go a a trip.

423
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,973
Speaker 1: You know, it's kind of annoying to do that and it sucks.

424
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:08,698
Speaker 1: and if you mess up You got to go back and mess with it again.

425
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:18,017
Speaker 0: Now this was before the advent of what we like to call dynamic HTML or just dynamic web pages Database dynamic HTML something different.

426
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:28,287
Speaker 1: Yeah PHP's and CGI's and pearls and pythons and rubies and the ability of web servers to run code to Dynamically generate web pages.

427
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,540
Speaker 0: So very simply before you'd make the web page someone went to your site.

428
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,623
Speaker 0: They would see the web page.

429
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:39,097
Speaker 0: now with these content management systems you well with these techniques We'll get a little ahead of ourselves.

430
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:46,520
Speaker 0: there You make the instructions for the web server to make the web page and then you put the data in a database or something.

431
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:53,680
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, let's say I make a webcomic and I all I do is I have a folder full of webcomic images.

432
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,368
Speaker 1: They're just JPEGs and they're.

433
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,920
Speaker 1: the names of the files are the date.

434
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:08,193
Speaker 1: well I make a little program and I say program look at the current date and then go and get the comic of that date and Display it.

435
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:18,367
Speaker 1: So now someone visits my web server and they say hey web server Give me the home page and the little pro instead of just giving them the page which is what you know Just that HTML I wrote by hand.

436
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:25,530
Speaker 1: The program would run and the program would pick the newest webcomic or the current webcomic and give it to them.

437
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:32,856
Speaker 0: Yeah It would basically write a web page on the fly for every day every single visitor who came to the site based on whatever Parameters you gave it.

438
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:38,202
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could also do something like okay Hey program, look at the URL the person typed in.

439
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,890
Speaker 1: does that URL have the date in it?

440
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,946
Speaker 1: If the date is in the URL get the comic for that date.

441
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:47,610
Speaker 1: now I've only written one little program and I've written one web page.

442
00:28:48,071 --> 00:28:53,630
Speaker 1: But depending on what URL the person types in and what date it is the what's on the pages will change.

443
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:55,838
Speaker 0: So what are the benefits of this as it is now?

444
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:59,170
Speaker 0: now instead of having to make manual web pages?

445
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,070
Speaker 0: So your content and your design are intertwined and you're constantly meddling with both of them.

446
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,990
Speaker 0: Now you have a thing that will present the data and you don't have to worry about that.

447
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:14,968
Speaker 0: All you have to do is mark up the data itself and put it in a format that the thing will understand And it'll take care of the rest.

448
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:15,649
Speaker 1: Yep.

449
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:23,349
Speaker 1: So whether it's a webcomic or a blog post if you want to make more stuff for your website You don't actually need to modify your website.

450
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,586
Speaker 1: You just make a text file with your.

451
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:33,710
Speaker 1: you know Your blog post or you make an image with your webcomic and you upload it into the right folder and BAM You've got your stuff going on now.

452
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:43,310
Speaker 0: that's great and all but it still requires a lot of technological know-how to set up and It doesn't remove a lot of the because now you still have to interact with the database.

453
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,137
Speaker 0: You still have to interact with these directories.

454
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:48,450
Speaker 0: You still have to deal with each individual item that you're putting up.

455
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, the web the system takes care of the presentation, but you still have to do the backend work.

456
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,438
Speaker 1: So what do we do?

457
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,890
Speaker 1: We make a content management system.

458
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:10,362
Speaker 1: Now if you want to still do the back-end work There are sort of these halfway light content management systems that exist like block some I don't know how to pronounce it Bo lo Bo lo s XOM below access.

459
00:30:10,402 --> 00:30:12,088
Speaker 1: So I don't know if the X or the S comes first.

460
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:12,750
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

461
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:30,925
Speaker 1: There are things that do that But for people who don't have the time to deal with that like a single Perl script to manage their whole website you use things like WordPress Andrew Paul and blogger and movable type and Emotion engine and I can't think of any others right now, but there's a lot of them.

462
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,009
Speaker 1: What do these do?

463
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:39,930
Speaker 1: Well, they use a database to the fullest abilities and an administration interface and it's it's all super powerful.

464
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,482
Speaker 0: So now you've got this set up and it'll.

465
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:45,570
Speaker 0: it takes care of the front end and the back end.

466
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:53,190
Speaker 0: so basically all you have to do now is Create your content in the system and it'll take care of the rest.

467
00:30:53,491 --> 00:31:01,017
Speaker 0: So instead of having to interact with the low-level back-end once it's set up like a look at our podcast We've run WordPress.

468
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:02,223
Speaker 0: WordPress is running.

469
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:03,610
Speaker 1: It's sort of like we have a web server.

470
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:07,242
Speaker 1: We install this program on the web server called WordPress.

471
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:09,890
Speaker 1: then we log WordPress automatically.

472
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,597
Speaker 1: And you know, we have a database server.

473
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,650
Speaker 1: Also WordPress automatically does its thing with the database server.

474
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,657
Speaker 1: We just had to tell it where the database server is.

475
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,010
Speaker 1: So it's keeping a lot of information in the database.

476
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:25,646
Speaker 1: We visit the WordPress website we log in then we see a box.

477
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:28,203
Speaker 1: the box says, you know Do this do that?

478
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:28,548
Speaker 1: do this?

479
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:36,786
Speaker 1: so if I want to make a new post for the podcast I go New post and there's a box and I type the new post in the box and then I click publish.

480
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:38,110
Speaker 0: it creates an environment where?

481
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:45,569
Speaker 0: You can do all of the editing and writing or whatever you need to do for your content Without having to interact with the technological aspects of it.

482
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:57,563
Speaker 1: So you make your website once, you know, you make one theme for your website, you know You only have to design the header once the footer once, you know What you want posts to look like what you want the archives to look like.

483
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:12,810
Speaker 1: you design all those things just one time and then from then on you go and you log into your website and this is an administrator's interface and you make new content and people can post comments and forums and whatever your CMS offers.

484
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:17,462
Speaker 0: So since these things exist even though that a lot of people don't seem to know about the next time.

485
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:32,483
Speaker 0: if any of you were thinking of making some sort of website or something and you have to ask someone like you want to know how to make your mat your navigation or how to make your site and You want to use Dreamweaver or you want to make a web page the old-school way.

486
00:32:32,503 --> 00:32:34,930
Speaker 0: and you ask anyone like us?

487
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,121
Speaker 0: The answer is pretty much going to be use a content management system.

488
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,350
Speaker 0: There's no reason to make pages by hand anymore.

489
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:45,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, too many people just do things the old-school way and they cause themselves unnecessary grief.

490
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,789
Speaker 1: I mean look at how many people out there I see them.

491
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,780
Speaker 1: They're looking up the specifics of how to make an RSS feed.

492
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,468
Speaker 1: and it's like dude if you use a content management system It automatically makes your RSS feed.

493
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,833
Speaker 1: You don't need to do anything.

494
00:32:56,853 --> 00:33:03,955
Speaker 1: it that that's the power of having your website in a database and such being handled by some Application to some other.

495
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:04,417
Speaker 1: guy wrote.

496
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's fully extensible because all the data is there.

497
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:15,077
Speaker 0: So we've got our WordPress and you know We tag all of our episodes say with different things so you can click on Anime and get every post we've ever made about anime.

498
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:22,057
Speaker 0: say we want to make a special feed that has I don't know Every board game episode we've done.

499
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:25,670
Speaker 0: we want to make a special thing about board games or a special board game section.

500
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,522
Speaker 0: We don't need to do anything.

501
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:28,750
Speaker 0: It's already all there.

502
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:33,748
Speaker 0: All we need to do is make a page that draws all the board game episodes together and formats them.

503
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:39,670
Speaker 0: However, we want Yeah, I mean so you can change your website completely without having to change anything behind the scenes.

504
00:33:40,251 --> 00:34:04,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, if your content, you know that belongs on your website your articles your pictures all your the things that people are coming to Your website to see if they are all organized You know in a database or on a file server in a way that makes sense to a computer then the content management system can present them in whatever way it is told to do and They do it in a very clever way and you don't need to work on that shit anymore.

505
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:07,690
Speaker 1: No HTML writing is necessary unless you want to make a theme.

506
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:15,590
Speaker 1: No, PHP Programmings are necessary unless you want to make a plug-in or a theme, you know, it's all done for you.

507
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:18,029
Speaker 1: Stop making websites by hand you fools.

508
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:20,619
Speaker 1: Why are you causing yourself this pain?

509
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,168
Speaker 1: And why are you asking me to help you do things the bad way?

510
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:23,248
Speaker 1: Why?

511
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:33,670
Speaker 0: I mean, it seems like a lot of especially a lot of organizations like most anime conventions even seem to just Make a website by hand and they have a lot of trouble with it.

512
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:43,510
Speaker 0: And then whenever the webmaster changes or a new year comes there's always all sorts of confusion as to well Who designed this or this part doesn't work with that or we need to rewrite that page.

513
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,577
Speaker 0: We don't have access to it.

514
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:46,268
Speaker 0: And none of that's a problem if you use a CMS.

515
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:49,829
Speaker 1: No, it's like if you want to change the way your page looks.

516
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,090
Speaker 1: well.

517
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,110
Speaker 1: There's a theme and the theme is like, you know, very simple.

518
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:53,693
Speaker 1: There's the header.

519
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,829
Speaker 1: if you modify the header the header changes on every page.

520
00:34:57,191 --> 00:34:58,256
Speaker 1: You'll need to change it once.

521
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:01,590
Speaker 1: none of this copying it onto every single freaking page.

522
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:05,070
Speaker 1: Maybe one time you mess up and now there's a broken page somewhere on your site.

523
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:06,815
Speaker 1: none of that business happens.

524
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:13,869
Speaker 0: and remember a lot of people they hear cut CMS or content management system and the first thing they Think about is oh that only works if you want to make a blog.

525
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,746
Speaker 0: That's the basic format that all these make.

526
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:22,250
Speaker 0: by default You can use these content management systems to make all sorts of sites that don't look anything like blogs.

527
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:32,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of times if a site uses a popular content management system like, you know movable type WordPress or drew Paul you can recognize it because they have the default themes.

528
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:38,610
Speaker 1: You know in the default look and feel of sites that running those CMS's but you can change the themes a lot.

529
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:44,889
Speaker 1: I mean I'm pretty sure it's whit TV runs on drew Paul and it doesn't look like anything that any other drew Paul sites.

530
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,090
Speaker 0: plus.

531
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,914
Speaker 0: I mean we're working on an updated geek night site and it's not gonna look at all like it looks now When we're done with it,

532
00:35:51,114 --> 00:36:02,094
Speaker 1: no, not at all, you know, it's like you could have anything running in the back and The people who are actually coming to visit your site will have no idea what's going on back there If you don't want them to know.

533
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:03,379
Speaker 1: plus you look.

534
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:09,884
Speaker 1: if a CMS, you know has too many features It's better to have one with too many features than what would not enough features.

535
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:15,670
Speaker 1: if it doesn't have enough features Then you need to start hacking at it to do plugins and shit and it's a pain in the ass.

536
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:20,190
Speaker 1: If your CMS has too many features you can just disable the features you're not using.

537
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:23,545
Speaker 1: I mean, I know a lot of sites that run drew Paul, which has a forum.

538
00:36:23,926 --> 00:36:26,536
Speaker 1: They don't use that forum If you just don't even know what's there.

539
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:33,205
Speaker 1: I mean, it's in there somewhere, but no one's using it and there's no links to it Or anything, you know, it just picked the CMS.

540
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:33,929
Speaker 1: that's right for you.

541
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,970
Speaker 1: A lot of them out there kind of suck, but we're not gonna get in the specific ones or anything.

542
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,633
Speaker 1: I already said that.

543
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,781
Speaker 1: but yeah CMS is.

544
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:43,130
Speaker 1: they are for the people who make the smart web pages.
