40
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:06,320
Speaker 0: Oh Well, anyway, we got some news now everyone.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:13,589
Speaker 0: This was huge news apparently and it was on far cuz a news flash and everyone's talking about it But it's not really a big deal.

42
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:23,500
Speaker 0: now Bill Gates has announced that he is Mostly done with Microsoft in that he's going to step down for many of his duties by next year or two years from now.

43
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:33,039
Speaker 1: He stepped down for most of his duties a few years ago when he stopped being CEO and he's now only chairman of the board You know, so now he's just getting rid of even more duties.

44
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:41,220
Speaker 0: now the thing is Bill Gates has not had a lot of Really much of anything to do with what Microsoft does day to day for a long time.

45
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, Steve Ballmer.

46
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:44,750
Speaker 1: and who's that other guy?

47
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,917
Speaker 1: Ray Ozzie Ray Ozzie and the other guy?

48
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:47,800
Speaker 1: everyone forgets his name.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget his name and Ray Paul Allen.

50
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,251
Speaker 1: He hasn't had anything.

51
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,800
Speaker 1: that he left Microsoft a long time ago with his mad moneys.

52
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's the secret guy with all the moneys who ran away.

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,874
Speaker 0: So I just the news is making such a big deal out of this and it really isn't.

54
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:09,040
Speaker 0: it's not like suddenly Microsoft is gonna become a good company or a more evil company or Vista's not gonna suck or anything's gonna change.

55
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:17,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bill Gates really hasn't done anything in a long time at least nothing significant or really hands-on and He's not going to.

56
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,633
Speaker 1: he's gonna do even less.

57
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:23,860
Speaker 0: even back in the day He didn't really do so much technologically.

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,160
Speaker 0: It was more that he was very savvy on the business side.

59
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, even in the earliest days and Microsoft was in a quote garage All he did was steal stuff from other people.

60
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:33,853
Speaker 1: He didn't actually do much.

61
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,157
Speaker 0: He could do things.

62
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:39,365
Speaker 0: He was very smart Yeah, but he realized that that was That wasn't.

63
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,380
Speaker 0: he realized that wasn't what he needed to do to get ahead.

64
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing about Bill Gates is that from what he said a bunch of times is that?

65
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:48,944
Speaker 1: He has more money.

66
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:53,200
Speaker 1: He knows what to do with obviously and he you know, he wants to give it all away.

67
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:58,108
Speaker 1: but his problem is that It's not easy to give it away.

68
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,538
Speaker 1: Cuz what if you give it away to someone who does something bad with it?

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,140
Speaker 0: So there's an easy answer to that Give it to me exactly.

70
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:09,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bill Gates if you listen to geek nights, uh, we could use some cash.

71
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:14,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, we sure could Just made my student loan go away.

72
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:15,670
Speaker 1: Just like 50 G's.

73
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,700
Speaker 1: with 50 G's my car loan of my student loan would be gone.

74
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,791
Speaker 0: I would be set hell if someone gave me 10 grand.

75
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,959
Speaker 0: I could be I could make myself filthy rich with that.

76
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:27,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, I need 50 because 40 makes the debt go away.

77
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:28,720
Speaker 0: I would make the debt go away.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,277
Speaker 0: I'd use that 10 grand to make more money.

79
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:35,060
Speaker 1: Now I would just do the 40 to make the debt go away and then the last 10 to make more money.

80
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:40,120
Speaker 0: You're actually having 10 grand in cash is much more valuable than having 10 grand less of debt.

81
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:52,280
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying if I had 50 grand if I had zero debt and 10 grand actually That's a stupid investment because the the student loans you have and all the debt you have the interest on them is there.

82
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:53,336
Speaker 0: But it's not so bad.

83
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:59,000
Speaker 0: But having that much capital together is worth so much more money as an opportunity cost.

84
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends what I'm gonna do with it.

85
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:06,860
Speaker 1: Probably what I'm gonna do is make some softwares and use the money to live while I make the software.

86
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:14,000
Speaker 1: Wow, I would just invest in real estate and such No stocks if I was gonna invest in real estate.

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,919
Speaker 1: I don't want like a million dollars so I could buy a whole bunch of houses.

88
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:22,560
Speaker 0: Well now use the 50 grand as cash or down payment or you use that to help finance a loan.

89
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,217
Speaker 1: But then I need to keep my job.

90
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:26,066
Speaker 0: No, not really.

91
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,133
Speaker 0: You can also live off of it.

92
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,980
Speaker 0: Yeah You just have to work on the other stuff full-time.

93
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't wanna.

94
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:38,160
Speaker 1: the idea is to just be able to work on my own thing and live whatever.

95
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,932
Speaker 1: so Netscape You know the browser that no one uses anymore.

96
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,440
Speaker 1: At least no one should be using anymore.

97
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:52,200
Speaker 0: Yeah Netscape was good back when ie was version 2 and 3 and 3 as soon as ie 4 came out.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,764
Speaker 1: That was the end of Netscape not just business wise there's a whole big story on the business end We won't get into.

99
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,000
Speaker 1: but software wise Netscape was dead as well.

100
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:09,260
Speaker 1: Since then Netscape has pretty much been Mozilla Reskinned to be Netscape.

101
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,671
Speaker 1: So nowadays, of course Netscape isn't Mozilla with a bunch of skins.

102
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:16,360
Speaker 1: It's Firefox with a bunch of skins.

103
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:24,840
Speaker 1: If you download the Netscape browser It's the same thing as Firefox only with a bunch of extensions and skins and all kinds of stuff to make it all Netscape.

104
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:24,982
Speaker 1: Aole.

105
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:40,510
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, AOL owns Netscape now and Back in the day They tried to take Netscape calm since it used to be just a website for the browser and turn it into a quote Portal to compete with the likes of Yahoo.

106
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:43,039
Speaker 1: and who else is a portal back in the day?

107
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,651
Speaker 0: You know, I don't remember I didn't really go to.

108
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:49,296
Speaker 1: like goes like goes Like goes is dead, isn't it?

109
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:59,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I assume it is all those old-school sites that punk kids don't remember because they didn't use the internet in the 90s and even Back then the people who use the portals were usually not the most savvy people.

110
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, the savvy people use the Alta vistas in the web crawler Yeah, or they just knew URL that's right.

111
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,199
Speaker 1: Yeah web crawler wasn't that good, but had a cute spider anyway.

112
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:21,020
Speaker 1: So a well just redid Netscape calm recently possibly even today and the redo of Netscape Calm is basically just a dig clone.

113
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:22,206
Speaker 1: That's what they did.

114
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:28,096
Speaker 1: is they took Netscape calm and they put a clone of dig on it Except of course without the democracy and the freedom and the awesome.

115
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,501
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, there's.

116
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:35,780
Speaker 1: there's obviously some stuff going on behind the scenes, you know changing votes or maybe it's just shitty software running the site.

117
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:40,378
Speaker 1: But all it does shitty software from AOL Do you think?

118
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:42,651
Speaker 1: That's a surprise.

119
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:48,633
Speaker 1: No, so The story is that the way their thing works.

120
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:55,259
Speaker 1: and dig you just submit stories And then if stories get enough digs they go on to the front page.

121
00:07:56,002 --> 00:08:01,457
Speaker 1: At this Netscape the new Netscape calm seems to work where instead of users submitting stories.

122
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:05,660
Speaker 1: It sort of scrapes the stories off of.

123
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,360
Speaker 1: You know the news wires.

124
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:14,738
Speaker 1: So it's as if Google News was also looked like dig instead of looking like Google News And of course a bunch of AOL shit all over it.

125
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:22,979
Speaker 1: What happened today was that on dig there was a story about Netscape calm copying dig and it got dug a lot.

126
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:26,153
Speaker 1: People clicked on it and it took him to Netscape calm.

127
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,499
Speaker 1: and Netscape calm.

128
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:36,554
Speaker 1: one of the sources for stories is dig calm and People dug the story that Netscape calm took from dig.

129
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:41,578
Speaker 1: that was about Netscape calm Copying dig and a dug it right to the top.

130
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,224
Speaker 0: Dig dug.

131
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:46,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what it's just hilarious.

132
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:46,926
Speaker 0: I tried to me.

133
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,548
Speaker 0: I tried to come up my head with some sort of funny Joke or thing where I'd say dig dug.

134
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:54,097
Speaker 0: at the end and we both laugh, but I had nothing.

135
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:54,960
Speaker 0: so I just said dig dug.

136
00:08:55,121 --> 00:09:02,391
Speaker 1: It's like if I wrote a news story about how like Google is the worst company ever and Google News is evil And then it got to the top of Google News.

137
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:03,717
Speaker 1: That's what it's like.

138
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:14,359
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just awesome Things of the day.

139
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:16,469
Speaker 1: So we did the things of the day.

140
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:22,114
Speaker 1: we started doing the main bit and then rim Has keyboard on the lap and he hit the button and he deleted it.

141
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,500
Speaker 1: So now we're doing it again.

142
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:30,599
Speaker 0: Yep, mostly because I got my Mac and it's nice and shiny but for a lot of reasons I still need my Linux box every day.

143
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:34,160
Speaker 0: So I've got both of them on my desk now and I don't have a KVM or anything.

144
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,459
Speaker 0: So it's a real pain in the ass.

145
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,477
Speaker 1: You could just put that keyboard on.

146
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:40,530
Speaker 0: you know The wood there where this now the key the cord doesn't reach.

147
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,714
Speaker 0: that keyboards real crappy.

148
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:43,400
Speaker 0: It's that crappy one that you had.

149
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,827
Speaker 1: We throw out that wireless one didn't we?

150
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,133
Speaker 0: that wireless one barely worked.

151
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,358
Speaker 0: Anyway, it did barely work.

152
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:48,700
Speaker 1: You're right.

153
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,972
Speaker 0: Anyway, cuz I still need my Linux box for a lot.

154
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,540
Speaker 0: The Mac is great, but it's not perfect.

155
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:55,759
Speaker 1: Let's redo them things of the day All right.

156
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,693
Speaker 0: Anyway, I've got this thing that I found and it's a little bit.

157
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,180
Speaker 0: you plug it into the headphone jack on an airliner.

158
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,460
Speaker 0: Now I know there's different kinds of headphone jacks.

159
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,700
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly which one it fits because a lot of airlines have those proprietary ones Where they try to sell you the $4 headphones.

160
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,482
Speaker 1: Bastards.

161
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:13,585
Speaker 0: now that matters.

162
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:18,318
Speaker 0: anyone who actually tries to listen to that music is really not deserving keeping their money in the first place.

163
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,447
Speaker 0: Nope but this device.

164
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:30,329
Speaker 0: you plug it in and you crank the volume all the way up and it will charge a little trickle charger from the Electricity coming through as audio and then it'll.

165
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,960
Speaker 0: you can use that trickle charger to recharge any electronic device.

166
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:36,120
Speaker 0: You have that charges via USB.

167
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,785
Speaker 1: That means to iPods.

168
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:43,859
Speaker 0: it charges at about a third the rate of the normal charger plugged in as it normally would be.

169
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:46,723
Speaker 1: hmm, it can help.

170
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:47,326
Speaker 1: I can see.

171
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:52,267
Speaker 1: maybe if you have like an iPod that you used a little bit and you just want to fill it Up all the way and you have a long flight

172
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:55,820
Speaker 0: or just if you have a long flight to make it last a third longer

173
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,361
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can make it last a third longer But

174
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:02,319
Speaker 0: actually probably more than a third longer because it charges much faster than it dissipates.

175
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:04,289
Speaker 1: Could be it takes.

176
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:10,840
Speaker 1: not it doesn't take very long to charge Yeah, but certain devices can use a lot of electricity depending on how you use them.

177
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,280
Speaker 1: Like if you have one of those portable DVD players you can forget it.

178
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:17,778
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but keep in mind that regardless they things charge a lot faster than these charge.

179
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:20,907
Speaker 1: nowadays Depends on the battery depends on the device.

180
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, most devices with lithium ion batteries charge very quickly.

181
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:26,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's a good example.

182
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:29,480
Speaker 1: if you have a Game Boy Color, right?

183
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,787
Speaker 1: Let's say you had a USB cable to charge that.

184
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:32,269
Speaker 1: somehow.

185
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,720
Speaker 0: if you that takes double-a batteries and uses a ton of power.

186
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:44,990
Speaker 1: I know no way to recharge is giving an example your examples silly and broken and giving example of a device that can use more electricity in one mode than in another mode.

187
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,020
Speaker 1: because if you if you use a Game Boy Color with Game Boy Color games Then it's fine.

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,267
Speaker 1: But if you put Game Boy games that use a little bit more electricity The GBA is even worse.

189
00:11:54,307 --> 00:12:00,899
Speaker 1: if you put Game Boy or Game Boy Color games in a GBA It drains the batteries faster than if you play GBA games on it.

190
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:07,568
Speaker 0: but I mean I don't see how that's relevant because it's still extent no matter what mode you're using even if it Uses the battery really quickly.

191
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,600
Speaker 0: It still delays that by giving you some more power.

192
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,860
Speaker 1: It does it does help but you know in some modes of certain devices, they will discharge faster than they recharge.

193
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:21,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it still extends the usable amount of time it does indeed.

194
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,200
Speaker 0: So whether or not it discharges faster than it recharges is meaningless.

195
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:32,437
Speaker 1: Well, cuz if it you can recharge it faster than you can discharge it you will extend the life pretty much as long as the flight goes.

196
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:37,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, as opposed to it will run out anyway, but it still extends it.

197
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,260
Speaker 1: it does.

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,599
Speaker 0: That's really the whole point of the device.

199
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:45,620
Speaker 0: It's like those little bits you can buy where you Put a double-a battery in this thing and stick it on the bottom of your cell phone and it recharges it.

200
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,804
Speaker 1: Yep, personally though.

201
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:48,491
Speaker 1: I'd rather have a hand cranky type of thing.

202
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those aren't really so efficient.

203
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,339
Speaker 1: They have more efficient ones than others.

204
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,886
Speaker 1: You know, it really depends on How comfortable.

205
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,920
Speaker 1: some of them are more comfortable to hold in the hand, you know.

206
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:09,938
Speaker 1: And depending on what you're trying to recharge like I wouldn't want to recharge a whole iPod with a hand crank Yeah, but I can recharge a GBA battery pack with a hand crank.

207
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:20,192
Speaker 0: now Of course regardless of the usefulness of this thing The point I want to make is that I am fairly certain within a reasonable amount of time This device is going to be banned from Airlines.

208
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:21,960
Speaker 1: Oh, they banned freaking everything from airplane.

209
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:27,000
Speaker 0: I just see it being people being afraid of it draining power from the airplane or being dangerous.

210
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,358
Speaker 1: That's first of all, it's not likely, you know, but If I was in charge, it really depends how the device works.

211
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:39,500
Speaker 1: I mean, does it just take the analog audio signal and convert it into electricity?

212
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,079
Speaker 0: It's probably just a voltage differential and draws as much power as it can.

213
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:48,651
Speaker 1: Yeah, that that might not be so good But if it just takes the sound, you know what though?

214
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:54,612
Speaker 0: honestly when I flew to Raleigh for an amazement There were just power outlets.

215
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:55,495
Speaker 1: Yep.

216
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:56,960
Speaker 1: They were just power outlets.

217
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,847
Speaker 0: I could have plugged anything into them if I wanted.

218
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:00,253
Speaker 1: trains have those also.

219
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:00,916
Speaker 0: Yeah.

220
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:01,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

221
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,891
Speaker 1: Maybe this is for some planes that don't have power outlets.

222
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,259
Speaker 0: I think it's more just a gimmick to sell to people.

223
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,632
Speaker 1: People seem to like funky USB devices and shit.

224
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know All right.

225
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,725
Speaker 0: Now we did Scott's thing of the day first.

226
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:20,265
Speaker 0: most only did my thing of the day first because Scott's is actually heady and kind Depressing a little scary.

227
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:21,388
Speaker 1: Now.

228
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,113
Speaker 1: This is a YTM ND.

229
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:25,200
Speaker 1: You're the man now dog.

230
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,911
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not a funny YTM ND.

231
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:31,620
Speaker 0: In fact, it seems to bill itself as the unfunny.

232
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:41,060
Speaker 1: It's called the unfunny truth about Scientology And the URL is the unfunny truth that YTM ND calm now.

233
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,010
Speaker 0: I'd like to preface this by saying that we really really don't like.

234
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,346
Speaker 0: I don't like stupid people.

235
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,012
Speaker 0: We don't like ugly people.

236
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,920
Speaker 0: We don't like smelly people at people.

237
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,450
Speaker 0: Scientologists are pretty much almost at the top of my list of people.

238
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:04,620
Speaker 0: I don't like because they I mean They have funny silly beliefs and we make fun of them for that.

239
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,829
Speaker 0: I mean they believe in aliens e-news and whatnot for real.

240
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,396
Speaker 1: but volcanoes and nukes and aliens.

241
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:23,406
Speaker 0: in addition to that They I don't know kill people ruin lives steal money generally make the world a worse place and they're a crazy evil cult a Real crazy evil cult not like a joke.

242
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:29,503
Speaker 1: Haha cultists, you know, like really those guys who all kill Oh, really?

243
00:15:29,523 --> 00:15:34,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, really, you know like David Koresh style crazy cults man scary shit.

244
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:43,993
Speaker 1: So this little YTM ND will show you all of the major Incidents of Scientology evil.

245
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:49,275
Speaker 1: there are plenty more In fact, there are shit tons more but these are the big ones.

246
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:56,309
Speaker 0: These are the ones that are either really kind of disturbing or Really verifiable or just really graphic.

247
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,860
Speaker 1: Yep, or really famous the ones that made the evening news.

248
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:01,509
Speaker 0: I mean the really famous one.

249
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:11,591
Speaker 0: the Elisa McPherson case is here which it was a clear-cut case where Scientologists effectively kidnapped a woman and Starved her to death and then brought her back to a hospital after she died.

250
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:12,113
Speaker 0: Yep.

251
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:13,860
Speaker 1: I don't know why that was their mistake.

252
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:21,240
Speaker 0: Well, they got off Because they have a lot of money and a lot of lawyers and the time didn't get off in the civil suit.

253
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:24,540
Speaker 0: Well, they we don't exactly know what happened in the civil suit.

254
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:31,500
Speaker 1: I think my guess is that the family wouldn't really care what there is if people knew what the result of the civil suit was.

255
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,985
Speaker 1: only Scientology would care.

256
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:44,093
Speaker 1: so I'm guessing the family got quite a bit because That that's in Scientology made them can Force the concession that whatever they got would be secret.

257
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:45,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it was just a settlement.

258
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:47,369
Speaker 0: So they probably gave him a bunch of money to shut him up.

259
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was probably plenty of monies.

260
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,840
Speaker 0: But Scientologists are evil and they have done evil things.

261
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:57,600
Speaker 0: Some of them who aren't evil are just stupid but stupid and evil are interchangeable in terms of effect.

262
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,287
Speaker 1: Yep there are plenty of people who aren't in the.

263
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:08,540
Speaker 1: the people at the top of Scientology are evil and There are some people down and low in Scientology mostly these people who got killed.

264
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:16,700
Speaker 1: Who are people that just believe this shit and They don't realize they think they're doing good because they believe in something that's false?

265
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:32,320
Speaker 0: yeah, in fact, I could see how people could get drawn in because Scientology when they first explained it to you sounds a lot like the fourth way or all those other many myriad Philosophical interesting books and makes a lot of sense at first because it's real generic stuff.

266
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:37,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, and once they hook you in with that the moon eats your soul, of course and Xenu appears.

267
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:41,559
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean a lot of the stuff that Scientology will tell you when you first join them.

268
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:49,079
Speaker 1: you know seems to make a lot of sense and a lot of it is generic good life advice that I would give you if You came to me and asked me stuff.

269
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:58,953
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing is they have this phony bullshit reasons for that advice meaning aliens and whatnot and Psychiatrists are evil.

270
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:02,188
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like don't take drugs.

271
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds good.

272
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:04,717
Speaker 0: Don't take drugs.

273
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:08,910
Speaker 1: doctors prescribe Don't take any drugs any.

274
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:11,140
Speaker 1: any disease can be cured with vitamins and minerals.

275
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,426
Speaker 0: Alright, well that cures one thing.

276
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:18,600
Speaker 0: I mean Darwinism is in full effect in that case indeed indeed.

277
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:25,518
Speaker 1: But of course the problem is is you know some person who is just stupid, you know is taking drugs.

278
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:30,297
Speaker 1: happily Scientologists take them take their drugs away from them and then they die.

279
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:34,358
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, I think there was one case there where they forced a guy to stop taking his.

280
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,422
Speaker 0: uh I think it was.

281
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:39,580
Speaker 0: it was see anti-seizure medication and he then shortly died of a seizure.

282
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:41,106
Speaker 1: Huh?

283
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,154
Speaker 1: Hmm, huh?

284
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:45,000
Speaker 1: Yeah Scientology has nothing to do with science.

285
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:50,340
Speaker 1: Not at all In fact is the opposite of science and it is evil.

286
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:57,049
Speaker 1: if there were some sort of You know superheroing going on some underwear pervert ISM.

287
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,798
Speaker 1: I am sure that Scientology would come under their wrath.

288
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:06,720
Speaker 1: Now if there is an evil organization on earth that needs to be destroyed this is it now?

289
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,402
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not.

290
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:14,249
Speaker 0: the people who lead Scientology are obviously evil and obviously don't buy into it, but then some of them Yeah, well, yeah, they pretend to buy into it.

291
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,866
Speaker 1: You talk about my mother that way sometimes you They could just be insane.

292
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:34,940
Speaker 1: It might it's hard to tell the people at the top of Scientology It's hard to tell which ones are evil and they they're neither smart or the ones that are You know insane evil like mad scientist and the ones that are just stupid.

293
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,540
Speaker 0: Well mad scientist is a lot more like our friend Lisa than anything.

294
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:46,275
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm talking about real mad scientist Like, you know that they really think they're gonna make a Frankenstein and take over the world for real.

295
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:49,377
Speaker 0: Yeah one Lisa real.

296
00:19:51,301 --> 00:19:56,760
Speaker 1: Not only do they think they're gonna do it they think they're doing it right now and they're trying real hard.

297
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,931
Speaker 0: Well, she does have bird flu.

298
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:06,476
Speaker 0: Yeah Well as a serious, yeah But I'm really torn as to how to deal with the people who just were tricked by this.

299
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:12,931
Speaker 0: I mean on one hand they their lives are being ruined by this cult and I you really want to help them.

300
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:19,847
Speaker 0: but at the same time Yeah, well at the same time leave it this way Some people Christians.

301
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:20,771
Speaker 0: There's a famous quote.

302
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:27,139
Speaker 0: I love the sinner hate the sin Meaning hate Scientology, but love and help the people who are trapped in it.

303
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:34,999
Speaker 0: But then there's Morpheus in the matrix Yeah, and his solution to all these people who are part of the system.

304
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:40,135
Speaker 1: They're going to turn into agents and kill you so don't be afraid to just blow them away.

305
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:53,760
Speaker 0: if it saves your own ass though if any of you ever really want to have some fun come down to New York City with us some weekend and We will have our day of it going around the subways pestering the Scientologists.

306
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:59,386
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you see people in the streets anywhere giving Personality tests stress tests etc.

307
00:20:59,426 --> 00:20:59,928
Speaker 1: etc.

308
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:12,845
Speaker 1: with these weird little meters that have these metal handle thingies those are Scientologists, and you should harass them and pester them about Xenu cultists and Murders and all sorts of things.

309
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:17,459
Speaker 0: yeah, Lisa McPherson that name any Scientologist knows that name and is afraid of it.

310
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:28,651
Speaker 0: yeah, actually though a lot of new Scientologists don't because a lot of Scientologists aren't allowed to surf the internet without Someone from the church helping them out.

311
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,439
Speaker 1: yep keeping an eye on me.

312
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:42,440
Speaker 1: This is this is a news story that people who aren't in Scientology or specifically against Scientology know about because I mean seriously do you remember like that?

313
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:46,492
Speaker 1: Every year there's big news stories, and then there's kind of small news stories.

314
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,656
Speaker 1: This is a news story.

315
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:50,625
Speaker 1: That was like a local Florida type of thing.

316
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:54,820
Speaker 0: this is like what was going on while OJ was on trial in Tampa.

317
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:56,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I don't know you don't know.

318
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,096
Speaker 1: It's it was some small back news story.

319
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:07,559
Speaker 1: so very few people Remember it specifically and even people who do remember it is because they care about Scientology positively or negatively.

320
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,985
Speaker 0: well I like how you mentioned Florida.

321
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,712
Speaker 0: so when I needed the name of a random city.

322
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:12,620
Speaker 0: I just automatically said Tampa awesome.

323
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:15,692
Speaker 1: So this is not something a lot of people know about.

324
00:22:16,194 --> 00:22:16,495
Speaker 1: you know.

325
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,865
Speaker 1: so they don't realize Scientology is super evil.

326
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:24,585
Speaker 1: unless you show them the unfunny truth that YTM ND calm yep Which I highly recommend watching.

327
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:27,316
Speaker 0: I'll warn you it is a little graphic a little disturbing.

328
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:28,400
Speaker 1: it warns itself.

329
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,242
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

330
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:31,167
Speaker 1: It's it should be disturbing.

331
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:33,433
Speaker 1: you need to be disturbed by Scientology.

332
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:34,034
Speaker 1: so watch this.

333
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:41,599
Speaker 0: yes unless you were already disturbed Now anyway, it's Thursday, which means we can talk about whatever the hell we want.

334
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:46,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, and yesterday while we were talking about the mocha art festival.

335
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:48,719
Speaker 0: We mentioned Ichi the killer.

336
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:50,905
Speaker 1: Oh Each of the killer.

337
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,420
Speaker 0: now we didn't want to do a showist motion picture of our time.

338
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:59,414
Speaker 0: We didn't want to do a show just on each of the killer.

339
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:00,479
Speaker 0: so we brawn it a little bit.

340
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:05,754
Speaker 0: We would like to talk about our interest in now not just violent movies.

341
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:06,756
Speaker 1: Yeah violent movies.

342
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:07,398
Speaker 1: everyone seen.

343
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,983
Speaker 1: Rambo Predator.

344
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:13,479
Speaker 0: yeah now all the action flicks we have a special place in our hearts.

345
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,000
Speaker 0: in fact I would say that cockles are warmed by these movies.

346
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:30,536
Speaker 1: Ultra violent movies stupid violent movies Riccio Riccio Ebola syndrome people and the one that I watched at the most recent Otacon that no one else watched.

347
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:33,108
Speaker 1: that I forget the name of But you don't want to watch that one.

348
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:34,174
Speaker 0: that movie was just painful.

349
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:34,737
Speaker 0: I walked out.

350
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:35,200
Speaker 0: I was smart.

351
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,533
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I can find it at the Otacon website.

352
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:41,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll look while You talk here now.

353
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:47,406
Speaker 0: the difference between a violent movie and an ultraviolet movie at least the way We would like to describe it is that one.

354
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,633
Speaker 0: a violent movie has violence in it.

355
00:23:49,974 --> 00:23:59,450
Speaker 0: it may be comprised mostly of violence But there is some sort of plot there are some sort of there are some non-violent scenes And the violence is definitely movie violence.

356
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:00,132
Speaker 0: hmm.

357
00:24:00,453 --> 00:24:10,580
Speaker 0: and an ultra violent movie One you know in a movie when there's some sort of like a horrible thing is happening and the camera always like shows you a Bit and then cuts away and leaves it to your imagination.

358
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,624
Speaker 0: Ultra violent movies.

359
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:19,366
Speaker 0: the camera is fixed pointing at the horrible thing from start to finish and then a little while after Yep in some movies.

360
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:23,080
Speaker 1: You know violence is just a thing that happens like the Godfather.

361
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:29,869
Speaker 1: You know it's a story about mafia guys, and when there's a story about mafia There's gonna be a violence going on.

362
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:35,798
Speaker 1: and they show some of that violence when it's appropriate But they do it in a cinematographer.

363
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:37,382
Speaker 1: Lee Cinematographically.

364
00:24:37,683 --> 00:24:38,565
Speaker 0: I like that word a lot.

365
00:24:38,585 --> 00:24:42,898
Speaker 0: Scott cinema all right cinema that didn't get in kiss gonna bring you do.

366
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,623
Speaker 1: cinematographically Fashion like.

367
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:57,404
Speaker 0: a good example of this is in suicide Kings when Dennis Leary you know captain fish boots goes and beats the hell out of a drunken abusive guy and The way he does it is.

368
00:24:57,444 --> 00:25:00,840
Speaker 0: he walks over and he picks up a toaster and he wraps the cord around his hands.

369
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,895
Speaker 0: He's got this basically fist toaster toaster fist toaster fist.

370
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:07,144
Speaker 0: I like that should be a superhero Cinematographer.

371
00:25:07,164 --> 00:25:21,444
Speaker 0: cool, and he beats He cocks over and he starts beating this guy pretty much to death but it just shows him and his hand and him swinging the thing and hitting something off camera and Making the noise.

372
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:29,878
Speaker 0: that sounds like someone hitting a watermelon with a toaster cinematographer But they don't show the blood splattering or anything.

373
00:25:29,918 --> 00:25:32,930
Speaker 1: yes You know what the point of that movie is not the violence.

374
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,299
Speaker 1: the point of that movie is other things.

375
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,629
Speaker 0: Ultraviolet movies are movies where the plot is violent.

376
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:41,619
Speaker 1: the point of the movie is violence like when you watch a porn.

377
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:49,876
Speaker 1: there might be A plot, but the point of the movie is to watch people doing it or to watch naked people Or to watch some other fetish.

378
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:50,319
Speaker 1: you have.

379
00:25:51,042 --> 00:26:00,353
Speaker 1: The point of a violent movie an ultra crazy violent stupid violent movie is to watch Fake violence or perhaps a real violence.

380
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,809
Speaker 1: if you're that freaky Yeah, and it's full.

381
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,097
Speaker 1: and who cares about the plot?

382
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:14,100
Speaker 1: you might as well You know it's like watching those little clips on YouTube of a million people hurting themselves, but at least you know It's fake, so it's not like wow that's horrible.

383
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:18,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, this stuff on YouTube is usually like a guy hitting his head or a guy falling off a skateboard.

384
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:21,025
Speaker 1: This is Disemboweling but fake.

385
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:22,972
Speaker 1: you know completely.

386
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:25,039
Speaker 1: mutilation fling, but flake.

387
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:29,893
Speaker 0: But also there are really dark sense of humor around everything.

388
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:34,610
Speaker 0: yep if I needed words to describe these movies I mean black humor doesn't quite cut it.

389
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,940
Speaker 0: black humor is like eight heads in a duffel bag.

390
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:38,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is not.

391
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:39,268
Speaker 1: This is beyond.

392
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:42,679
Speaker 0: this is like eight baby heads in a thousand duffel bag.

393
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:47,053
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's quite like a dead baby joke.

394
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:54,770
Speaker 1: in a way watching these movies you know you just if you don't have a If you have a weak stomach at all you can't watch them.

395
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,220
Speaker 0: I mean I consider myself a fairly jaded cynical person.

396
00:26:58,581 --> 00:27:03,197
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but when I saw each of the killer for the first time the full unedited.

397
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:11,077
Speaker 1: real deal If it's cut if the version of each the killer you watch is cut in any way do not watch it.

398
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,086
Speaker 0: now there were scenes.

399
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,799
Speaker 0: expect in fact almost every scene in that movie.

400
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,379
Speaker 0: I Physically cringed.

401
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:20,704
Speaker 0: It was.

402
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,092
Speaker 0: I mean there was I. I don't.

403
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:23,440
Speaker 0: I can't ruin some of this.

404
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,792
Speaker 1: I don't want to be even when there wasn't violence because it was just.

405
00:27:26,973 --> 00:27:28,418
Speaker 1: you know the way the movie was.

406
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:28,980
Speaker 1: it's opaque.

407
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,036
Speaker 0: I just knew the violence was coming.

408
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:38,520
Speaker 0: yeah And some of its quick and some of its slow and some of it is silly like the face.

409
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:44,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, the face on the wall yep, but if I needed our English words to describe these movies.

410
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:47,716
Speaker 0: I'm gratuitous I Unnecessary.

411
00:27:48,221 --> 00:27:50,590
Speaker 1: Make sure you multiply all these words by 10.

412
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:57,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean once again the key word here is ultra Ultraviolet mega super hyper like Ultraman.

413
00:27:57,913 --> 00:28:03,331
Speaker 0: you have a man right a man's just a dude But Ultraman is awesome and ultra and powerful.

Speaker 1: we should.

415
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,423

00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:10,192
Speaker 0: yeah, you know what tasteless.

417

00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,335
Speaker 0: that year it was video 7 the smallest of the video rooms.

437
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:52,540
Speaker 1: yes now We looking through this guide saw a movie called the ichi the killer.

438
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:58,720
Speaker 1: There was a description of the movie that claimed it was the most violent thing ever blah blah blah blah blah.

439
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,000
Speaker 1: And I was like oh really that sounds interesting.

440
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, really next to every movie in the whole program guide was a genre.

441
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:10,159
Speaker 1: now the genres you know obvious action horror comedy.

442
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:19,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, hentai whatever the genre for each of the killer was a genre that was applied to no other movie.

443
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,356
Speaker 1: the genre was tasteless.

444
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:32,166
Speaker 0: Now this was intriguing to us and in fact we and as a result almost the entire front row crew Who was there that year decided?

445
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:34,233
Speaker 0: We are going to go see this movie at midnight.

446
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:40,298
Speaker 1: Yep on Saturday Saturday It's always late Saturday night every Otakon at least for the past three years.

447
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,571
Speaker 1: Late at late on Saturday night is some horribly violent movie.

448
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:46,576
Speaker 0: now when we go to cons.

449
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:47,659
Speaker 0: We meet a lot of cool people.

450
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:57,332
Speaker 0: and That year because we were gonna go see this ultraviolet movie whenever we met someone cool, and we parted ways We always said hey meet us in Saturday and video 7 at midnight.

451
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,440
Speaker 0: We're gonna watch this horribly violent movie.

452
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:08,500
Speaker 0: Yep Now we said this all day Friday and all day Saturday up until the movie that took like hundreds of people Everyone we met we were like hey come see this movie with us.

453
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:13,941
Speaker 1: So as a result we get to video 7 and there is a line Like.

454
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:20,239
Speaker 0: we showed up almost an hour before and there was already a line bigger than that room.

455
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,460
Speaker 1: now.

456
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,250
Speaker 1: Was it because of our word spreading.

457
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:23,196
Speaker 1: I like to think so.

458
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,539
Speaker 0: yes in fact I will assume so because we're that awesome.

459
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:26,543
Speaker 0: But who knows?

460
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:28,410
Speaker 0: now not only was I mean the line was long.

461
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:33,396
Speaker 0: there were like a hundred people in this line because the room It was gonna be showing but the room could not hold the line.

462
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:43,608
Speaker 0: now We stood around for a while and about it was about five minutes before midnight and the line had grown into and I'm actually not Exaggerating here over a thousand people.

463
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:47,800
Speaker 1: well because if there's a hundred people line everyone walking by thinks all this must be something good.

464
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:48,815
Speaker 1: Let me get in line for it.

465
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:55,040
Speaker 0: There were I don't know how many people were actually in the line, but there were definitely over a thousand.

466
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:55,926
Speaker 1: It was a lot.

467
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,033
Speaker 0: It was a mob.

468
00:31:57,154 --> 00:31:58,100
Speaker 0: It was not a line.

469
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,988
Speaker 0: It was a giant unruly mob.

470
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:05,029
Speaker 1: now when the staff finally got the mob under control They sent us to the biggest video room.

471
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,700
Speaker 0: They had this room seats multiple thousand people.

472
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:11,716
Speaker 1: Yes, so we filled up at least over a third of this room.

473
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:21,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Then we watched E.T the killer and the movie has the most tasteless it right up front.

474
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:24,160
Speaker 0: During the opening credits something horrible happened.

475
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:24,904
Speaker 1: It's it's the.

476
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:32,414
Speaker 1: we watched the version that is completely and 100% Uncut with all the directors added whatnot.

477
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:41,544
Speaker 1: there was nothing missing from this movie And I recommend you do not watch it in any other form because that will inoculate you against the ultra violence That is each of the killer.

478
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:46,520
Speaker 1: Yes, if you watch the cut version and then you watch the uncut version it will not work.

479
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:55,140
Speaker 1: it's sort of like You know putting your foot in the water and then slowly gliding into the pool versus jumping into the freezing cold water.

480
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:56,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is polar bear.

481
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,196
Speaker 0: This is beyond polar bear.

482
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:04,880
Speaker 1: This is But Let's just go through a few of the scenes in each of the killer to give people an idea.

483
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:12,120
Speaker 0: Alright, well, let's start with like the opening bit because there are two scenes in the opening the credits which the credits.

484
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:13,969
Speaker 1: Alright, there's a scene before the credits.

485
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:33,874
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but then there's the credits bit and basically during the first scene the whole audience because no one really knew what to expect except for I think a few old veterans who had heard of this movie and The crowd, you know cheered when the movie started and then when the scene the first scene actually began Everyone kind of shut up.

486
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:37,820
Speaker 1: The first scene is what is a horrible rape.

487
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:45,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got this mafia guy as a hooker and he's beating the ever-living shit out of her while raping her.

488
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:50,063
Speaker 1: yep, yeah and raping this woman now and Graphically mind you.

489
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see him beating her and raping her.

490
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:54,195
Speaker 1: They don't hide anything.

491
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,306
Speaker 0: and that this penis the crowd went from to.

492
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:02,239
Speaker 0: And then after about five minutes of this the crowd went back to.

493
00:34:03,482 --> 00:34:07,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean some people got up and left because they didn't realize they couldn't take it.

494
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:09,183
Speaker 1: and you know, that's granted That's gonna happen.

495
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:12,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the movie build itself is the most violent horrible movie ever.

496
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:13,809
Speaker 0: What did they expect?

497
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,739
Speaker 1: and you know, it's fake.

498
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:22,065
Speaker 1: So you go in you seeing this because you want to see violence and when you see the violence if you're not cheering You probably shouldn't watch it now.

499
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:25,380
Speaker 0: Now you might just think alright, so it's this short violent scene.

500
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,068
Speaker 0: This scene is several minutes long.

501
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,356
Speaker 1: This movie was hours long.

502
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:30,956
Speaker 1: Goddamn.

503
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:31,780
Speaker 1: Was it too long?

504
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,322
Speaker 0: there was.

505
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:41,828
Speaker 0: I mean the scene was just an uninterrupted horrible scene and then the credits play and The were the first of the words.

506
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:43,513
Speaker 1: the guy gets killed first.

507
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:44,176
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

508
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:45,400
Speaker 1: Well in a horrible bloody mess.

509
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:47,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't even get to see that.

510
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:52,000
Speaker 0: Barely you get to see it a little bit you get to see the aftermath of that when the guy slips in the intestines.

511
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:59,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, now bear in mind the guy slips and falls because he stepped on some intestines on a floor That is a hundred percent covered in blood and slippery.

512
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,951
Speaker 0: now you might be thinking in your head You know B movie gore because there's a lot of B movies with gore.

513
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,740
Speaker 1: but they had a budget for this film a high one.

514
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Speaker 0: This is like that hentai that anime world order was talking about my lady innocent.

515
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:24,104
Speaker 0: Yeah Where the production values are so high and the movie is so realistic and takes itself so seriously That it just it ends up being this Unfathomable thing.

516
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:24,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

517
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:27,072
Speaker 1: it's not like a fake blood and guts.

518
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:31,887
Speaker 1: It's like whoa, that is Expensive fake blood and guts.

519
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,800
Speaker 1: that looks all fancy in the CG and whoa.

520
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:43,094
Speaker 0: Now during all of this and then the eventual murder there is a guy outside Watching and getting off on it.

521
00:35:43,114 --> 00:35:48,820
Speaker 0: He Kinda, yeah, he auto erotically arouses himself to a finish.

522
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:51,433
Speaker 1: Well, I think the point is is that he his.

523
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,520
Speaker 1: While he kills he is finishing.

524
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,505
Speaker 0: It's well I guess I'll cut to the chase.

525
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:07,740
Speaker 0: the title the title splash for the credits Nishi the killer Forms out of the puddle of semen that the main character leaves behind.

526
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:11,670
Speaker 0: Yep This movie it's the most it.

527
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,260
Speaker 0: Well, it was the most tasteless movie we had ever seen.

528
00:36:14,993 --> 00:36:20,255
Speaker 1: No Okay, so Let's just do a couple more scenes in each of the killing.

529
00:36:20,336 --> 00:36:23,147
Speaker 1: All right, let's see There's three that really stand out in my mind.

530
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:25,555
Speaker 0: Let me guess the hot grease the hot grease.

531
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,080
Speaker 0: Yeah nipples and nipples.

532
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,393
Speaker 0: Third one's up in the air tongue.

533
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:33,425
Speaker 1: Oh, oh Let's talk about the tongue.

534
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:34,127
Speaker 0: All right, that's it.

535
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:37,180
Speaker 0: That's a perfect example of why this movie is so violent.

536
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,174
Speaker 1: So there's this is the main character of each of the killer.

537
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:41,440
Speaker 1: actually isn't each of the killer?

538
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:48,460
Speaker 1: This is Yakuza guy and he's sort of like a punk Badass dude with all sorts of piercings and shit.

539
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:55,599
Speaker 0: And he has his mouth at the sides of his edges of his lips cut back into his cheeks And then he has two piercings holding it together.

540
00:36:56,176 --> 00:37:02,640
Speaker 1: Yeah So if he takes these piercings out basically his cheek is completely split and he can open his jaw real wide.

541
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,420
Speaker 0: He doesn't do that though, but he smokes a lot and he puffs smoke out those holes.

542
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:09,195
Speaker 1: He puffs smoke out through the sides of his cheek.

543
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:10,865
Speaker 1: It's kind of scary I think.

544
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:12,234
Speaker 1: it's all CG obviously.

545
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:12,536
Speaker 0: Yes.

546
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,269
Speaker 1: Yes So he's a scary mafia dude.

547
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:19,980
Speaker 1: Yakuza and he's like the main is the focus of most of the movie.

548
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:25,342
Speaker 1: Now he does something he screws up and he's not the head of the Yakuza He's.

549
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:26,908
Speaker 1: he has bosses above him.

550
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:29,537
Speaker 0: In fact, his screw-up was the grease incident.

551
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:32,264
Speaker 1: Yes, and He screwed up.

552
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:33,729
Speaker 1: So he needed to apologize.

553
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,580
Speaker 1: now, you know in the in the Yakuza, you know, you cut off a finger.

554
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,004
Speaker 0: Let that finger fly.

555
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:38,526
Speaker 0: Yep.

556
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:39,850
Speaker 1: That's the saying.

557
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:48,620
Speaker 0: I don't know how they say it in Japanese, but it was in sanctuary was yeah it was yeah, so He goes to the boss and he says I apologize.

558
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,479
Speaker 1: He says people say I have a sweet tooth.

559
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:57,679
Speaker 1: I will you know, I will apologize by cutting off the source of my pleasure.

560
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:00,749
Speaker 1: now You'd think he's gonna cut off his penis.

561
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:02,997
Speaker 1: because he said he's gonna cut off the source of his pleasure.

562
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:03,880
Speaker 0: the whole crowd went.

563
00:38:04,643 --> 00:38:08,019
Speaker 1: But right before that he said I have a. people say I have a sweet tooth.

564
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,197
Speaker 0: now He reaches down like he's gonna undo his belt.

565
00:38:11,062 --> 00:38:16,859
Speaker 1: He's getting a knife and then he pulls out a knife and then he pulls out his tongue his tongue with a piercing in it.

566
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:24,360
Speaker 0: Obviously now at this point a real movie would have cut away and showed you the reactions of the people as something horrible happened off-screen.

567
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, you would see the mafia bosses cringing and you did see the mafia bosses cringing.

568
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,780
Speaker 1: Yes, but what you actually see is the camera stays on the guy's face.

569
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:48,440
Speaker 1: He holds his tongue in one hand out of his out of his mouth and the knife in the other hand and you see him cut off The front of his tongue like they don't cut away until the tongue is completely cut off and it's so realistic.

570
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:59,383
Speaker 0: I mean He's like he's actually kind of sawing at it because it won't go and pull it on it and tugging on and he pulls the Last bit like out and there's still the piercing in the bit that was cut off and he puts it in Little jar.

571
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,810
Speaker 1: He's like handing it to the mom.

572
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the mafia guy and the boss is like, uh Just leave it there.

573
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:13,619
Speaker 0: and then in the Okay, his cell phone rings and he picks it up and he's like yo and he starts talking to the guy in the other hand Of the boat bloods just pouring out of his mouth.

574
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:17,031
Speaker 1: That's the kind of movie each of the killer is now.

575
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,120
Speaker 1: that's the kind of movie all these movies are now.

576
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:25,600
Speaker 0: We thought when we'd seen each of the killer that nothing could ever top that that that was the most horrible movie ever made.

577
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:30,316
Speaker 0: Well, well violence wise yes, whoa did Otakon prove us wrong.

578
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:33,387
Speaker 1: Oh the next year at Otakon We went back for Saturday night.

579
00:39:33,428 --> 00:39:35,014
Speaker 1: We assumed they'd have more and boy.

580
00:39:35,034 --> 00:39:35,657
Speaker 1: Do they have more?

581
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:47,038
Speaker 0: they had Ebola syndrome, which is probably the most tasteless horrid wretched movie ever Released unto man and beast.

582
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,037
Speaker 1: now I'm not gonna talk about the plot of each of the killer because it's just crazy stupid.

583
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:56,920
Speaker 0: someone Took drugs and made this shit up, you know, at least each of the killer has a lot of humor in it.

584
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:02,619
Speaker 0: It does and the end is is very ava tacular and that you won't understand what syndrome had.

585
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:02,940
Speaker 1: humor.

586
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:05,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's a different sort.

587
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,137
Speaker 0: That was a different kind of humor.

588
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:23,551
Speaker 1: Yes so Let me tell you the plot of Ebola syndrome because because Ebola syndrome did have one thing right is that it had such a simple Plot that it was able to execute that simple plot fully While also fitting in lots of violence and nastiness and easy.

589
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:30,659
Speaker 1: the killer had a complex plot that was just stupid Complex or end of Ava type of shit the whole time.

590
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,932
Speaker 1: So it didn't really, you know, the violence sort of made the plot.

591
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:37,600
Speaker 0: remember that scene in each of the killer with the muscle, man.

592
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,251
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was fantastic.

593
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Ebola syndrome, here's the plot.

594
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,692
Speaker 1: There's a guy.

595
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,580
Speaker 1: he's a bad guy.

596
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, he murdered the lover of his girlfriend and then his girlfriend.

597
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:51,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a bad guy.

598
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,579
Speaker 1: He went to jail or you know, he ran away.

599
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:54,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was.

600
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:58,860
Speaker 0: he got away after murdering them and he ran away to another country South Africa.

601
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:01,448
Speaker 1: It was yeah, it was South Africa.

602
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:03,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, South Africa during the worst days.

603
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:06,170
Speaker 0: Yes I wanted to say the bad days, but it's still pretty bad.

604
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:17,610
Speaker 1: He gets a job in a restaurant and This is a bad guy real bad, but he's working for a bad guy Slightly less bad guy but a bad guy nonetheless.

605
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:24,782
Speaker 1: and they go to buy some animals To use to cook in the restaurant from an African village Whatever.

606
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:29,340
Speaker 0: now the African village they go to apparently has some horrible play like there's Ebola in the region.

607
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:32,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's actually a plot about how they couldn't get animals from the normal guys.

608
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:39,371
Speaker 1: So they had to go and get you know animals They knew were probably no good for cheap from the tribe.

609
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:43,245
Speaker 0: and like there are people dying of Ebola laying around and he's like Yeah, this meets fine.

610
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:43,829
Speaker 1: Yep.

611
00:41:44,352 --> 00:41:45,820
Speaker 1: So they think they bought some pigs, right?

612
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:58,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, now while the the boss guy is negotiating this he said I don't remember exactly what happens But the the horrible guy gets sent off with the car to do something He comes across a woman who has just died of Ebola.

613
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:08,060
Speaker 1: like he sees her in the field doing something I think near a stream and she has she's obviously ill and then she just passes out and dies next to the stream of Ebola.

614
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:14,394
Speaker 0: And what he thinks and we know he thinks it because he says it out loud is effectively Hot-damn, I haven't been laid in a long time.

615
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:19,860
Speaker 1: Here we go and Sure enough Ebola syndrome comes through in spades.

616
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:23,312
Speaker 0: Now you might think okay, that's it.

617
00:42:23,594 --> 00:42:29,400
Speaker 0: he catches Ebola and Well, actually he ends up being immune to Ebola, but he's still a carrier and he spreads it around.

618
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:37,774
Speaker 1: Yes The plot of Ebola syndrome is that this evil fuck guy Who is treated poorly by his boss and pretty much hates the world is in South Africa.

619
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:47,880
Speaker 1: He can give people Ebola But he only suffered the illness for a few days and then it went away and he is now immune to Ebola.

620
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:52,699
Speaker 1: But he can give it to people all he wants and he's gonna run around giving it to people.

621
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,850
Speaker 0: now He ends up for reasons.

622
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,580
Speaker 0: I really don't want to bother explaining.

623
00:42:57,463 --> 00:43:01,299
Speaker 0: killing people Who have Ebola or killing people?

624
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:08,680
Speaker 0: Grinding them up turning them into meat and his boss and his boss's wife and serving them at his restaurant as hamburgers.

625
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,440
Speaker 1: He gives them Ebola he grinds them up and he makes people burgers and serves them to the people in the restaurant.

626
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:26,810
Speaker 0: now it just gets worse from there and Surprisingly the only scene in the movie that was like really made the whole audience cringe like more so than everything else Was a useless rat the useless unrelated rat.

627
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,034
Speaker 0: There was a at one point.

628
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:29,639
Speaker 0: There's a dead rat laying in the street.

629
00:43:30,363 --> 00:43:32,454
Speaker 1: No, there's a living rat scampering about the street.

630
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:33,400
Speaker 0: I thought it was already dead.

631
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:34,284
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

632
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:37,196
Speaker 0: all I know is that they show a car running over.

633
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:40,792
Speaker 0: It's obviously a model But obvious they show a car just run over it.

634
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:45,949
Speaker 0: for some reason the whole crowd was like, oh It was like the movie was just horribly violent.

635
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:48,535
Speaker 1: and whatnot with this crazy bad dude?

636
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,744
Speaker 1: people dying of Ebola Which isn't pretty, you know.

637
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:58,124
Speaker 1: people getting chopped up people getting raped people getting killed all kinds of nastiness You know, I think he.

638
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:03,220
Speaker 1: animals getting killed whatever but completely unrelated to the rest of the movie.

639
00:44:03,461 --> 00:44:05,994
Speaker 1: There's just a scene of a rat getting run over by a car.

640
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:08,123
Speaker 1: That has nothing to do with anything There's no context.

641
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:12,600
Speaker 0: It's just random and that scene elicited more empathy from the crowd than the rest of the movie combined.

642
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:13,243
Speaker 1: That's cuz.

643
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,395
Speaker 1: it was random and it wasn't related.

644
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:22,260
Speaker 1: So, you know It's like if I show you a video of an animal scampering about the highway and then getting hit by a car.

645
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:28,380
Speaker 1: It's like oh, but if you did five minutes ago, you saw that animal, you know biting someone to give them rabies.

646
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,038
Speaker 1: You'd be like, ah, it's completely different.

647
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:38,247
Speaker 0: Now luckily the movie has a nice comeuppance at the end But it leaves a space for a sequel.

648
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:41,136
Speaker 0: it does it does but I'll ruin the movie right now.

649
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:51,555
Speaker 0: they get the dude There's the detective after him and basically he gets set on fire Hit by a car shot and then the detective who's chasing him now.

650
00:44:51,595 --> 00:44:59,237
Speaker 0: He's on fire and already hit by the car runs over and Unloads his pistol into the dude like running around in a circle and then starts cheering.

651
00:44:59,257 --> 00:44:59,719
Speaker 0: cuz he got him.

652
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,977
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you see this team running around town and cleaning up all the Ebola that this guy cuz.

653
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:13,300
Speaker 1: basically at the end of This movie the guy was running and spitting at people cuz they give them Ebola and they were chasing him in bio suits and stuff.

654
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,178
Speaker 0: Yeah literally.

655
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,252
Speaker 1: So, you know, they they spray this poison shit everywhere.

656
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:22,560
Speaker 1: He spit and cleaned up all the Ebola.

657
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:25,553
Speaker 0: I don't know why this movie had such an epilogue.

658
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:27,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really didn't need it.

659
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:29,991
Speaker 1: But they they put it in there.

660
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:32,220
Speaker 0: the movie is just in bad taste.

661
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:35,491
Speaker 1: It is in the worst taste you can possibly have.

662
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:44,760
Speaker 1: I mean if movies were food Then this would be me krob Ebola syndrome would be me kra and each of the killer would be natto.

663
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,151
Speaker 0: Hey katsu likes natto and he's coming over this week.

664
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:51,024
Speaker 1: I'd see likes each of the killer - yeah He's I think he does.

665
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:52,690
Speaker 0: of course katsu likes each of the killer.

666
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,172
Speaker 1: There you go.

667
00:45:54,076 --> 00:45:55,200
Speaker 1: I should like each of the killer.

668
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,220
Speaker 0: Now we didn't really have anywhere to go with this.

669
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,973
Speaker 0: We just really wanted to talk about violent movies and these movies that we'd seen.

670
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,378
Speaker 1: it's a note of contradiction.

671
00:46:05,518 --> 00:46:07,930
Speaker 1: last year I was the only one who held out.

672
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,720
Speaker 1: It was a really bad movie.

673
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,912
Speaker 1: I. it was horrible and violent, but it wasn't really that horrible and violent.

674
00:46:12,952 --> 00:46:19,580
Speaker 1: Most of it was just dark and Slow and boring and it was real late and we were real tired.

675
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:20,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the tiredness was.

676
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:29,186
Speaker 1: it had some horrible violence in it, but it wasn't extreme and it wasn't in the high ratio That the previous movies were.

677
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:30,751
Speaker 1: but I held out and watched.

678
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:33,740
Speaker 1: I don't remember the name of it because it was so unmemorable.

679
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:37,434
Speaker 0: It was a sequel to something - yeah, it was number two.

680
00:46:37,454 --> 00:46:39,120
Speaker 1: I couldn't tell you what happened.

681
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,540
Speaker 1: All I can tell you is there's some fat ugly lady who couldn't get laid but she was also a serial killer.

682
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,002
Speaker 1: And she was.

683
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:48,132
Speaker 1: she was a serial killer and she was a projectionist in a movie theater.

684
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:51,028
Speaker 1: and then crazy batshit happens in this horrible violence.

685
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:52,923
Speaker 1: the end Granted.

686
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:57,857
Speaker 0: I think the other movie we saw SARS Wars more than made up for the lacking.

687
00:46:57,897 --> 00:46:58,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was a comedy.

688
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,506
Speaker 1: That wasn't a crazy violent movie.

689
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,740
Speaker 0: So that doesn't really fit in but it filled my niche for that year enough.

690
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:09,560
Speaker 1: It did fill the niche for necessity to watch new amazing live-action films from around the world.

691
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,511
Speaker 0: I wouldn't call SARS Wars amazing.

692
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:12,818
Speaker 1: I would call it amazing.

693
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,747
Speaker 0: I Guess amazing in some senses.

694
00:47:16,068 --> 00:47:17,553
Speaker 1: It's at least awesome.

695
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:19,518
Speaker 0: Oh, it was fantastic.

696
00:47:19,618 --> 00:47:23,825
Speaker 1: Yes Hey SARS Wars Yeah, so why is it?

697
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:27,136
Speaker 1: there's two movies that are about diseases Ebola SARS.

698
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:37,693
Speaker 1: I'd like this year We got to go see you know bird flu or I just wonder because they didn't top Ebola syndrome this year.

699
00:47:37,895 --> 00:47:42,855
Speaker 0: Well this past year I don't think any movie out there exists that can top Ebola syndrome.

700
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,967
Speaker 0: in terms of the sheer horror There has to be a movie out there.

701
00:47:46,107 --> 00:47:49,459
Speaker 0: Where where can we go other than actual snuff films?

702
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:58,831
Speaker 0: uh We can go see reenactments of actual snuff films But that's not so bad cuz that's just each you the killer without the plot.

703
00:47:59,513 --> 00:47:59,935
Speaker 1: All right.

704
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:04,406
Speaker 0: It's also got to be horrible and tasteless I don't know.

705
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:08,788
Speaker 1: I'm telling you any bird flu fever or What's the other disease?

706
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:10,760
Speaker 1: Everyone's worrying about West Nile?

707
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,142
Speaker 0: Outbreak.

708
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:12,604
Speaker 0: I'm telling you.

709
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,151
Speaker 0: It's gonna be that more gallons disease.

710
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:16,219
Speaker 1: Oh more gallons disease.

711
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:19,325
Speaker 1: That'll be a good one.

712
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:25,607
Speaker 1: the disease from outer the disease of tasteless violence from outer space The what you need.

713
00:48:25,627 --> 00:48:29,380
Speaker 1: I think the way to beat Ebola syndrome is not with quality but with quantity.

714
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:37,891
Speaker 1: You need not a scene of a guy, you know raping Dead recently deceased woman who has Ebola.

715
00:48:38,272 --> 00:48:44,915
Speaker 1: you need a squad of guys raping a village of mixed genders and ages all recently dead of.

716
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:47,324
Speaker 1: you know, the Bird flu.

717
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:50,719
Speaker 0: I think we also need to just throw in some racism some sexism.

718
00:48:51,563 --> 00:48:52,446
Speaker 0: Every ism there is.

719
00:48:52,507 --> 00:48:54,736
Speaker 1: that is one thing these movies seem to be lacking.

720
00:48:54,836 --> 00:49:08,843
Speaker 1: other than you know The you know generic sort of toned down not serious racism, you know like me and rim will be like yeah those whatever's you happen to be we made up of fake cuz we What was it?

721
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:09,224
Speaker 0: Chuke?

722
00:49:09,665 --> 00:49:11,491
Speaker 0: Yeah, we made up a fake racial slur.

723
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:13,980
Speaker 0: that doesn't particularly mean anyone.

724
00:49:14,225 --> 00:49:17,832
Speaker 1: Yeah Eric racial slur everyone's a juke.

725
00:49:18,012 --> 00:49:19,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also no one's a Jew.

726
00:49:20,661 --> 00:49:25,034
Speaker 1: But yeah, we gotta add real racism real sexism.

727
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:26,920
Speaker 0: I guess it's just that real.

728
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:29,445
Speaker 0: You know what makes these movies.

729
00:49:30,027 --> 00:49:37,750
Speaker 0: I don't want to say interesting but interesting is that they cross Boundaries that filmmakers really don't cross.

730
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:47,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, even people who you know don't Tend to stick to the normal trends in their filmmaking don't do certain things.

731
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:56,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean not many filmmakers think it would be a wise decision to have your protagonist Necrophilia rape a woman who died of Ebola.

732
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,640
Speaker 1: Yeah that pretty much never happened in any movie.

733
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,896
Speaker 1: I mean even in movies you see like children don't get killed usually on screen.

734
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:05,980
Speaker 1: It's especially on TV.

735
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,790
Speaker 1: I don't think you were allowed to do that in America.

736
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:11,948
Speaker 0: It's not that you're not allowed It's sort of an unwritten rule.

737
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:14,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know there are rules about it for television.

738
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what?

739
00:50:16,387 --> 00:50:16,749
Speaker 1: have you made?

740
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:19,919
Speaker 1: a movie where some guy on screen like just?

741
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,431
Speaker 1: Stabs a bunch of kids in his classroom.

742
00:50:23,592 --> 00:50:23,752
Speaker 0: Well.

743
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,600
Speaker 1: It was like watch them all bleed to death.

744
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:30,540
Speaker 0: It was like when they made the movie based on Lolita, and there was all sorts of controversy about it.

745
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:31,862
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

746
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:32,907
Speaker 1: I don't know that.

747
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,234
Speaker 0: yeah, there was a lot even though.

748
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:34,797
Speaker 1: There's a movie.

749
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:41,896
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's actually a fairly decent movie But there is a shit ton of controversy about that movie for a number of obvious reasons.

750
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:43,905
Speaker 1: obvious reasons Yes, now.

751
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:47,040
Speaker 0: I guess what it is is these movies are the aristocrats joke?

752
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:49,004
Speaker 1: That is true.

753
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,330
Speaker 1: only they are Graphics not just talking.

754
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:58,537
Speaker 1: yes, yes We need to make each of the killer the video game or Ebola syndrome the video game.

755
00:50:58,677 --> 00:50:59,299
Speaker 1: That's what we need.

756
00:51:00,262 --> 00:51:02,932
Speaker 0: How about the live-action RPG system?

757
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,220
Speaker 1: or how about Custer's revenge the movie?

758
00:51:06,007 --> 00:51:08,780
Speaker 0: haha I'm telling you Custer should be in Smash Brothers.

759
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:12,360
Speaker 1: It could be the secret secret secret character.

760
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:21,832
Speaker 1: Yeah the only people who get to who can unlock Custer's revenge the people who get a Custer's revenge cartridge and Somehow wire it into the revolution.

761
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:32,940
Speaker 1: He only has one attack You get a ROM of Custer's revenge And you put it on a flash cart and you put the flash cart in the slot on the revolution And then you can unlock Custer in Smash Brother.

762
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:40,160
Speaker 1: That's how it is and you have to insert in each of the killer DVD eject it and then put in the Smash Brothers disc.

763
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:41,884
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

764
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:46,340
Speaker 0: You know what even if that were the case that would be on game facts within about seven seconds.

765
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:55,193
Speaker 1: So that is true, and we would do it and we'd use Custer every time And you throw each of the killer in smash or the the mafia guy at least.

766
00:51:55,414 --> 00:51:57,784
Speaker 1: I don't remember the guy's name I don't remember.

767
00:51:58,065 --> 00:52:03,165
Speaker 0: all I remember is that that movie ended in the most Unsatisfying way.

768
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:05,800
Speaker 0: I mean at least Ebola syndrome ended in a satisfying way.

769
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:12,260
Speaker 1: That's satisfying than the end of Ava is to some people who aren't satisfied with it Even though I was perfectly satisfied with the end of Ava.

770
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:19,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are a lot of people there who you know, that's the classic one that people you know Tend to agree is like a what the fuck ending.

771
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:28,916
Speaker 0: Well, I guess you the killer is more of a what the fuck ending than that because I guess my point is my idea Here is that with Ava the end of Ava was alright.

772
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:29,779
Speaker 0: people didn't like it.

773
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:31,247
Speaker 0: But look it makes sense.

774
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:32,634
Speaker 0: and look here's what it was saying.

775
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,368
Speaker 0: you can understand Why it was done that way kind of.

776
00:52:35,428 --> 00:52:36,494
Speaker 0: there is something there.

777
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:37,700
Speaker 1: you can understand most of it.

778
00:52:38,162 --> 00:52:39,950
Speaker 0: There is something that I'm not talking about the movie.

779
00:52:40,292 --> 00:52:41,920
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm talking about the original end.

780
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,795
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah about that it there was something there.

781
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:45,539
Speaker 0: there was something to it.

782
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,405
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the ending and the movie.

783
00:52:47,566 --> 00:52:53,628
Speaker 0: well the movie the whole end as a unit the movie was just the response to the Fanboys or weren't satisfied with the real end?

784
00:52:53,648 --> 00:52:58,152
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, but the point is I'm just saying yeah There's nothing to the end of each of the killer.

785
00:52:58,172 --> 00:52:59,118
Speaker 0: There's no deep meaning.

786
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:05,040
Speaker 0: there Might be but it's just what the file remember that the Raven and then the kid and then the guy who hung himself.

787
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,743
Speaker 0: But not really.

788
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:07,651
Speaker 1: or did he really?

789
00:53:07,772 --> 00:53:08,535
Speaker 0: or was that?

790
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:09,660
Speaker 0: I don't even know who that guy was?

791
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,956
Speaker 1: I mean go I think you go online and there's some explanations of it, and they did.

792
00:53:13,996 --> 00:53:14,880
Speaker 1: those didn't even make sense.

793
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:18,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, God someone's gonna call up and tell us we're idiots.

794
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:25,360
Speaker 0: No, because if anyone claims to understand the deeper intricacies of each of the killer or even just what happened.

795
00:53:26,023 --> 00:53:28,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the names of the characters, I know a little bit.

796
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:39,200
Speaker 1: I actually I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but I The way you spoil easy the killer is by describing all the violet the good violent scenes in great detail.

797
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:39,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait.

798
00:53:39,722 --> 00:53:40,987
Speaker 0: There's the plot thing the hypnotism.

799
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:43,034
Speaker 1: I can't be spoiled the hypnotism bit.

800
00:53:43,395 --> 00:53:44,620
Speaker 1: That's not a spoiler.

801
00:53:44,881 --> 00:53:46,326
Speaker 1: Okay, no one cares about that.

802
00:53:46,628 --> 00:53:49,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you do you're watching this movie for all the wrong reasons.

803
00:53:50,625 --> 00:54:00,468
Speaker 0: Go watch a better movie seriously All right, so I guess I want to open it up to the forums out there And it will probably talk about this again sometime.

804
00:54:00,788 --> 00:54:03,134
Speaker 0: What horrible movies have you seen that are ultraviolet?

805
00:54:03,696 --> 00:54:03,916
Speaker 1: Yeah?

806
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:09,651
Speaker 1: We're looking for the most depraved Films that you have ever seen.

807
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:11,299
Speaker 1: TV shows I guess count to yeah.

808
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,405
Speaker 0: now We're not talking about realistic real not realistic But not real things.

809
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:18,756
Speaker 0: don't go film some mugger killing a guy in an alley.

810
00:54:18,796 --> 00:54:24,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, don't Come tell us that you watched a holocaust documentary, and that's you know.

811
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:26,300
Speaker 1: of course that's worse than each of the killer.

812
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,774
Speaker 1: It's real, but that's not what we're talking about.

813
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:29,780
Speaker 0: We're talking about fake.

814
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,805
Speaker 1: Yep fake and horrendously Violent.

815
00:54:35,046 --> 00:54:38,080
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone out there can top each of the killer in Ebola syndrome?

816
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:38,802
Speaker 1: I don't think either.

817
00:54:38,882 --> 00:54:45,955
Speaker 1: and you know the only movies I can think of to come close are all the gory horror films like the Jason's and the Freddy's.

818
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,017
Speaker 1: and What are the other ones?

819
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:57,413
Speaker 1: Halloween Halloween yeah Get chucky kinda To a crypt keeper kinda all those sorts of things.

820
00:54:57,854 --> 00:55:03,262
Speaker 1: and the bad 80s horror movies Oh, yeah, you know those kinda, but that's a different That's.

821
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:05,774
Speaker 1: you know that's super gory.

822
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:06,920
Speaker 1: make you want to barf scary.

823
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:10,116
Speaker 1: That's not super ultraviolet for the sake of ultraviolet.

824
00:55:10,398 --> 00:55:12,548
Speaker 0: yep Cuz how hell?

825
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:13,151
Speaker 1: what's his face?

826
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:14,960
Speaker 1: so the pins on the face hellraiser?

827
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:18,837
Speaker 0: People seem to either love ultraviolet movies or hate them.

828
00:55:18,877 --> 00:55:20,020
Speaker 0: There's very little middle ground.

829
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:23,471
Speaker 1: It's all a matter of iron gut or fleshy gut.

830
00:55:24,073 --> 00:55:26,320
Speaker 1: if your gut is fleshy you'll bargo.

831
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:30,093
Speaker 1: I mean if your gut is iron you you will laugh mightily.

832
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:31,880
Speaker 0: as eg the killer went on.

833
00:55:32,261 --> 00:55:43,875
Speaker 0: I remember periodically like there'd be a violent scene and Everyone like they got worse and worse as the movie went on and after every violent scene at least a couple people would get up And walk away in disgust.

834
00:55:44,057 --> 00:55:55,278
Speaker 0: yeah But like even sometimes I'd be like oh Yeah, the crowd was really schizophrenic because they'd yell and scream and cheer.

835
00:55:55,539 --> 00:55:59,436
Speaker 0: well each You know caught a person up into a million pieces, but then they'd stop and go.

836
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:07,957
Speaker 1: ah When they do it looks disgusting and it's making me all queasy, but oh it was awesome Not one.

837
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,676
Speaker 0: Finally these are not movies to watch alone.

838
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:16,334
Speaker 1: No Enjoy I mean do not watch these alone under any circumstance.

839
00:56:16,354 --> 00:56:19,568
Speaker 0: if you watch each of the killer alone You're a sad man.

840
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,720
Speaker 1: You're a sad very sad, man.

841
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:26,140
Speaker 0: I mean these are movies designed to be watched with as many people as possible.

842
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:36,427
Speaker 1: I mean we watch each of the killer with thousand people yelling and screaming and cheering and cringing all in unison and I would have to say that that's pretty close to the minimum required to Watch each of the killer.

843
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,197
Speaker 1: a hundred just doesn't cut it.

844
00:56:40,418 --> 00:56:42,220
Speaker 0: You Also, really can't be easily offended.

845
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:49,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you are possible to be offended unlike us you should never watch these movies ever.

846
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,254
Speaker 0: Each of the killer is not so offensive.

847
00:56:52,274 --> 00:56:53,500
Speaker 0: It's just violent and horrible.

848
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:57,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, Ebola syndrome is directly offensive to many sensibilities.

849
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,265
Speaker 1: Oh I mean it offended me.

850
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:02,130
Speaker 1: It's got some if I could be offended.

851
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:03,414
Speaker 0: It's got some racism.

852
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,500
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of sexism.

853
00:57:06,064 --> 00:57:06,850
Speaker 0: It's got a rape.

854
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:08,159
Speaker 0: it's got murder.

855
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:14,360
Speaker 1: It's got cannibalism like necrophilia usually when someone does something offensive and people are offended by it.

856
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,003
Speaker 1: And I'm not.

857
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:18,600
Speaker 1: I say you shouldn't be offended by that Ebola syndrome.

858
00:57:18,983 --> 00:57:22,105
Speaker 1: I say I'm not offended by that But you probably should be.

859
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:26,784
Speaker 0: I understand why Ebola syndrome is a movie where if you're not offended by it You'll think to yourself.

860
00:57:27,146 --> 00:57:30,544
Speaker 0: Wow, my being offended gland is broken God damn.

861
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:33,616
Speaker 1: or you are should join the Club of Scott and we should go have an awesome party.

862
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:38,316
Speaker 0: Yeah Either that or you're a robot or you could be a robot.

863
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:42,712
Speaker 1: Yes robot You might be a robot if you watch Ebola syndrome without being offended.

864
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:44,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I got real close.

865
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:47,499
Speaker 0: I mean there were scenes like wow, that was terrible.

866
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:49,585
Speaker 1: Or I wouldn't.

867
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:52,620
Speaker 1: well, you know the raping of the recently deceased Ebola victim.

868
00:57:52,821 --> 00:57:55,874
Speaker 0: That wasn't even the worst thing in that movie not even close that.

869
00:57:55,935 --> 00:58:05,059
Speaker 1: that was just the start of the plot The Seed For the rest of the film to grow.

870
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,649
Speaker 0: Okay, we're done.

871
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:09,300
