1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:18,189
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, October 8th, I'm Scott, I'm Rip, and this is Geek Nights, tonight with the book club Der Steppenwolf.

2
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,048
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,780
Speaker 0: I've been rollerblading to the train station every day because my car, like the brakes are busted and I just haven't had a chance to take it to a mechanic.

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,280
Speaker 1: You haven't had the experience of driving on the brand new road.

5
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:41,720
Speaker 1: Ah, it's so smooth.

6
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,860
Speaker 0: I had the experience of rollerblading on that road and let me tell you.

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,280
Speaker 1: They paved our road, by the way.

8
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,520
Speaker 0: It's a pleasant experience.

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,200
Speaker 1: Our road that was desperately in need of paving was paved and it did an excellent job.

10
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,060
Speaker 1: They did it very quickly and it's great.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,060
Speaker 0: In general, it makes me very happy that I live in this little city of Beacon because- The thing is I paid for this road with taxes and now I'm leaving.

12
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:06,180
Speaker 0: Well thanks for the road.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:16,779
Speaker 0: But the cool thing is, my only complaint about Beacon, other than the key food, is that all the infrastructure is shitty and old.

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,639
Speaker 0: Like the power outages happen kind of often because like every pole is on the verge of death at any moment.

16
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,640
Speaker 0: Like at any second they're all just gonna fall over.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,620
Speaker 1: But I don't even have poles to be underground.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:31,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the modern suburbs are underground for the most part, at least the internal distribution in like a subdivision, not so much the like main carrier lines.

19
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,040
Speaker 1: There's this city, everything's underground.

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, including scary old steam pipes and electricity.

21
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,540
Speaker 0: No one knows where it's coming from or going.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,140
Speaker 0: But you know, Beacon, like my big complaint was all the old infrastructure, the busted roads, the busted sidewalks, and the elections are coming up.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,415
Speaker 0: And for a second I was thinking, "Huh, maybe I should figure out who's gonna raise taxes and fix this

24
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:52,560
Speaker 0: stuff.".

25
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,457
Speaker 1: I tried to figure out who to vote for, right?

26
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:55,700
Speaker 1: What?

27
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:05,760
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter because in the last month it looks like they got all this government subsidy money from the bailout and the stimulus package and suddenly they're fixing everything.

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,479
Speaker 0: Like they're replacing power poles and paving roads and fixing sidewalks.

29
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:16,139
Speaker 1: So I was trying to see who to vote for and I think I'm just gonna have to skip this vote because I happen to be moving very close to voting time.

30
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,960
Speaker 1: It's the local election, so it's the least important vote.

31
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,559
Speaker 0: Well it's also the most important.

32
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,320
Speaker 1: And I don't think I'll be registered in time to vote for like New York mayor, which could matter, but whatever.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,800
Speaker 0: Well think of it this way, it's the most important vote for you directly, but only if the candidates are reasonably different.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I looked at like the cards.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,879
Speaker 1: Apparently all the candidates go house to house.

36
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,400
Speaker 1: But when they came to our house, of course we were not home because we commute.

37
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:41,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,259
Speaker 1: Good job, guys.

39
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,080
Speaker 1: And they all left little cards.

40
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,019
Speaker 1: So I read little cards that they left.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,819
Speaker 0: I remember last time there was an election here, both parties basically said they would do the exact same thing.

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,579
Speaker 1: And one of the cards though, I remember one of the cards and it said one item on one of the cards really stood out to me.

43
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:03,020
Speaker 1: It said, took money back from the MTA, so money doesn't leave our county.

44
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,159
Speaker 1: And I was like, I was like, fuck you.

45
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:07,099
Speaker 0: You bastard.

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,339
Speaker 1: The only reason my money came into your county is because the train is there.

47
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,420
Speaker 1: Without that train, you wouldn't have nothing.

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,300
Speaker 0: I like beacon.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,160
Speaker 0: If there was no train, I would be living in Manhattan.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
Speaker 0: Cause what else am I going to do?

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,677
Speaker 1: So it's like, uh, I, I didn't know who to vote for, but I knew not that guy anyway.

52
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:24,160
Speaker 0: Yeah.

53
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,340
Speaker 0: But you know, rollerblading.

54
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:38,140
Speaker 0: So I have my rollerblades in the city and one thing I've never really done in my life is rollerbladed in a dense urban environment, but muse games, you know, Emily and Alex, the game company, they made their game guns of Icarus and we had a game party last night.

55
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,779
Speaker 0: So I was going to go.

56
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:46,880
Speaker 0: It's downtown and I decided to rollerblade from midtown to Chinatown during the like rush hour commute.

57
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:47,418
Speaker 1: Good job.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,640
Speaker 0: That was one of the more exhilarating and death defying things I've ever done in my life.

59
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:54,899
Speaker 1: You need a helmet for that shit.

60
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,220
Speaker 0: Actually, a helmet probably wouldn't have done me any good.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,260
Speaker 0: I had my, our risk guards.

62
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,037
Speaker 0: That's really all you need.

63
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:03,299
Speaker 1: A helmet would have done you some good if a car hit you, a car wasn't going to hit me.

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,959
Speaker 1: It could have.

65
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,720
Speaker 0: I wasn't too worried.

66
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:07,619
Speaker 0: I got to say the most dangerous place to be.

67
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,660
Speaker 0: If you're on the street, it's one of those fucking bike lanes.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,680
Speaker 0: You're better off just in traffic dodging buses than in those bike lanes.

69
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:23,197
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on which bike lane, you know, it's like, um, you know, the bike lane, like on Broadway is actually really wide and has a barrier next to it and like cars can't get into it.

70
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:23,559
Speaker 1: You know?

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,500
Speaker 0: So it's like stretch.

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,579
Speaker 0: You realize you get past that stretch and there's people just like parked blocking it.

73
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:28,159
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

74
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:29,080
Speaker 0: It's like, wow, great.

75
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,698
Speaker 0: Thanks dude.

76
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,560
Speaker 1: Bike people just sort of get used to it.

77
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:32,699
Speaker 0: And you know what?

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,699
Speaker 0: Rollerbladers too.

79
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:49,958
Speaker 0: But I got to say it was kind of awesome just dodging buses and going all over the street and cutting across and trying to figure out how to get to, I don't know if I'll do it again anytime soon because I afterward I thought maybe I might've died, but, uh, it was fun at least once.

80
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,259
Speaker 0: I feel like everyone should do that at least once in their life.

81
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:59,579
Speaker 1: You know, there's like, you know, the thing is, you know, if you've never done it before, I could understand why you think, oh man, is death defying whatever, right?

82
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,260
Speaker 1: It's like little old ladies riding their bicycles around New York city.

83
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:06,400
Speaker 1: It is not nearly a dangerous death, defying kind of thing.

84
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,360
Speaker 1: It just feels like it.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,260
Speaker 1: If you're not used to it as soon as you're used to it, it's just like, oh, whatever.

86
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,355
Speaker 0: Cause I've ridden bikes in that sort of traffic and in fact I've ridden bikes in the city before and it's a completely different experience from rollerblading one.

87
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:24,799
Speaker 0: rollerblades are not like you can maneuver very well, but what you cannot do quickly in the street without a bunch of space around you is stop.

88
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:34,220
Speaker 0: And also cars apparently just can't see a rollerblader like they did like bikes at least like they, they see bikes and they know I'm there.

89
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:39,419
Speaker 0: And while they might be mad at me and they might cut it close, I don't worry that the cars are just going to hit me out.

90
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,713
Speaker 0: Right.

91
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,440
Speaker 0: Cars almost just hit me out.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,919
Speaker 0: Just like I was completely invisible.

93
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:48,159
Speaker 0: I hit a guy's car with the shoes I was carrying after he almost hit me.

94
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:56,580
Speaker 1: If I do think about it, most of the time I've ever seen any sort of non bikes in the city, like skateboard guys and a blade.

95
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 0: It's always like in the, they're always on the sidewalk.

96
00:05:58,927 --> 00:05:59,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

97
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,400
Speaker 1: They don't really go down the street.

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,771
Speaker 0: So I tried to go down the sidewalk.

99
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,840
Speaker 0: that was even more dangerous.

100
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:03,897
Speaker 1: Yeah.

101
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:04,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

102
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,960
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'm still moving.

103
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,660
Speaker 1: I'm getting, making a good progress.

104
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:09,739
Speaker 1: I have the keys.

105
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:10,679
Speaker 1: I've got stuff.

106
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,660
Speaker 1: I'm going to get deliveries and whatnot.

107
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,360
Speaker 1: I went today to get a mattress.

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,577
Speaker 1: So I may say I went to the sleepies nearest my work because they have sleepies, not mattress King.

109
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:20,380
Speaker 1: Where is there a mattress King?

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,039
Speaker 0: I don't even know if that's a real place.

111
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,455
Speaker 1: I know.

112
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:22,689
Speaker 1: Right.

113
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,980
Speaker 0: The thing is, right.

114
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,240
Speaker 0: It sounds like it should be a real place.

115
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:33,439
Speaker 1: I usually, I would shop around for something like this and usually I would shop online also, but a mattress, you got to lay in it, you know, before you buy it.

116
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:36,040
Speaker 1: And a mattress is something you're going to have for a long time.

117
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,139
Speaker 1: Like the matches I have now I've had for eight years, you know?

118
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:40,959
Speaker 0: Wow.

119
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,039
Speaker 0: The mattress I've had, I have now I've had for nine years.

120
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:44,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

121
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:51,800
Speaker 1: I mean, and you know, the dude at the mattress place was like, look, you know, he was, he was a real friendly guy, but he obviously was a skilled mattress salesman.

122
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,399
Speaker 1: There was no question about that.

123
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,599
Speaker 1: Cause he's like, look, a mattress is something you got.

124
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:59,700
Speaker 0: He go up to you and he's like, the more expensive ones are clearly superior.

125
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:00,229
Speaker 1: No.

126
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,138
Speaker 1: What he actually said was, look, a mattress is something you're going to have, you know, for like 10 years, if not more right.

127
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:12,499
Speaker 1: It's you're going to spend how much time on it, half your day, every day, or at least like a 30 year day, every day.

128
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:19,857
Speaker 1: You know, you, you should get a good one, even if it costs more, you know, which is kind of true.

129
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:23,340
Speaker 0: Well, considering I'm sitting in an Aeron chair and you have a human freedom chair.

130
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,893
Speaker 0: I think that is exactly the argument to use on someone like.

131
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:28,099
Speaker 1: that is exactly the argument that I used on myself.

132
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,040
Speaker 0: I was like, well, you know, what matches did you get?

133
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,559
Speaker 1: I got, Oh, what the, I forget what the hell it was.

134
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:39,340
Speaker 0: It was, I forget to compare features because I, my mattress is a very expensive mattress.

135
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:43,240
Speaker 1: And I think the mattress is like $1,200, but that's about what mine was.

136
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,897
Speaker 1: So I, uh, you know, I basically, I knew, right.

137
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,000
Speaker 1: The thing is we had that thread in the forum.

138
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,239
Speaker 1: Like you can't avoid these psychological tricks, even though you know, they're there.

139
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:57,600
Speaker 1: The thing was what I did is I said, okay, psychological trick number one, the expensive wine tastes better, right?

140
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:58,216
Speaker 1: I knew that.

141
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,238
Speaker 1: So you know what I did?

142
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:05,420
Speaker 1: I laid on the mattresses and didn't look at any price tags, but until I had already determined which ones I liked better.

143
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,379
Speaker 0: Ah, good idea.

144
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:06,772
Speaker 0: Yep.

145
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,684
Speaker 0: So what's the plan?

146
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:14,440
Speaker 0: unless like something ludicrous, like you ask and it's a thousand, a hundred thousand dollars just to pick what everyone felt the best, no matter what kind of.

147
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,520
Speaker 1: And then trick number two, right.

148
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,015
Speaker 1: Was I knew that you'd sort of remember which ones you slept in based on the order you like laid on them in.

149
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,740
Speaker 1: So I laid out, I kept switching between them in different patterns.

150
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:30,480
Speaker 1: You know, I kept going back and forth across the store and you know, to try, you know, to compare better.

151
00:08:30,962 --> 00:08:37,360
Speaker 1: And a lot of this was really helpful because there were a lot of sort of like these test mattresses where it'd be like, you know, half the mattress is one way and half was the other way.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,879
Speaker 1: So you can just sort of roll over to sort of get a different feel.

153
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,039
Speaker 0: And some people buy actual mattresses like that.

154
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:43,418
Speaker 0: Yeah.

155
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:48,220
Speaker 1: I also tested out these pillows and I found like the best pillow.

156
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:54,080
Speaker 1: So I carry that same pillow to all the mattresses to get to get, you know, the correct comparison.

157
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:55,740
Speaker 1: You know, I'd always be using the same pillow.

158
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,240
Speaker 1: And then I picked a mattress and I'm like, yeah, just fucking give me this mattress.

159
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,817
Speaker 1: God damn it.

160
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,239
Speaker 1: Whatever.

161
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:01,579
Speaker 1: But they have a policy.

162
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,640
Speaker 1: If I think I can find the mattress cheaper, like elsewhere, I can get my money.

163
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,300
Speaker 1: I can get the difference plus 10 percent.

164
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:12,458
Speaker 1: So I'm going to go and shop around, see if I can find that mattress online for less money and get some money back.

165
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:19,479
Speaker 1: But yeah, the one thing that I learned going there because I went there during lunch, I'm trying to move without missing any work.

166
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,759
Speaker 1: So like every lunch, I'm doing something.

167
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:31,380
Speaker 1: If you have lunch in New York City or just pretty much anywhere, spend your lunch at the mattress store.

168
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:32,599
Speaker 1: It's like free naps.

169
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:33,780
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

170
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,680
Speaker 0: How long will they let me sleep before they come in a cost me?

171
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:47,300
Speaker 1: This guy was like, like totally, you know, of course I was buying a mattress, but he was like, he was like encouraging me to just like lay around his store and, you know, not leave until I, you know, bought something.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,523
Speaker 1: But, you know, you know, he might catch on after three years, be like, you know, I was already like.

173
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:57,121
Speaker 1: he was like super friendly, you know, I totally love to be friends with that guy.

174
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:01,060
Speaker 0: Are you sure it wasn't professionally friendly, like the people in the fancy hotels?

175
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:02,380
Speaker 1: He seemed genuinely friendly.

176
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,002
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

177
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:08,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, he was trying to get you to buy a mattress more than a thousand dollars.

178
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,157
Speaker 1: I know it's like it was weird because it was like the perfect salesman, like I was.

179
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,440
Speaker 1: his sales skills were either so good either.

180
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:26,759
Speaker 1: A, he was just genuinely super awesome or B, his sales skills were so awesome that, you know, whatever he can take my money because like, you know, some guys, their salesman, they come off with the hard sell.

181
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,900
Speaker 1: This guy just came off as like this guy I want to hang out with because he's so great.

182
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,640
Speaker 1: And he knew a lot about mattresses.

183
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:41,660
Speaker 1: I might have to go meet this guy, go to the sleepies on 57th Avenue, New York, Manhattan.

184
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,000
Speaker 0: So what do you pay you for an ad?

185
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Speaker 0: Is that just going out here?

186
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,261
Speaker 1: No, he was just real friendly and his psychological tricks worked on me despite me trying.

187
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:54,397
Speaker 1: I avoided the trick of judging the mattress by the price, but I couldn't avoid the trick of good salesmen.

188
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,260
Speaker 0: So I had to go there at some point.

189
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,239
Speaker 0: My mattress is getting old.

190
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,140
Speaker 1: Oh, apparently the mattress I have.

191
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:04,880
Speaker 1: I don't have to turn it over every six months.

192
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Speaker 1: I asked him, like, you know, so when, you know, should I turn my mattress over?

193
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,300
Speaker 1: He's like, no, new mattresses don't have to turn them over.

194
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:11,824
Speaker 1: Wow.

195
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,520
Speaker 0: I got to turn mine over every six months.

196
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,780
Speaker 1: He did have one trick that I didn't fall for, though.

197
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:17,360
Speaker 0: I tried to sell you something.

198
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,740
Speaker 1: Apparently the mattress has like a huge warranty, right?

199
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,263
Speaker 1: Like if a spring pops out like in an old cartoon, I get, you know, they'll replace the whole thing.

200
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,440
Speaker 0: So he tried to sell you some sort of special warranty.

201
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,442
Speaker 1: Apparently, mattress companies, all the mattress manufacturers have a trick in their warranties.

202
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:38,478
Speaker 1: If there's any stain whatsoever on the mattress, your warranty is just gone.

203
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:40,759
Speaker 1: That's the trick.

204
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,579
Speaker 1: So why is this a trick?

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,740
Speaker 1: Because they want to sell you a mattress cover.

206
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:46,846
Speaker 0: Wait, wait.

207
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,240
Speaker 0: One of those plastic things.

208
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:48,864
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

209
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,700
Speaker 1: A mattress pad like I have already.

210
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:51,362
Speaker 1: Right.

211
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:58,740
Speaker 1: The thing is, so you had these fancy mattress pads and he was like, oh, this one is hypoallergenic and this one keeps the dust mites out and this one's waterproof.

212
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,343
Speaker 1: And they're right.

213
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:01,380
Speaker 1: And I was like, whoa, I don't need waterproof.

214
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,939
Speaker 1: Well, he's like, imagine if you spill a glass of wine, you know, on your bed.

215
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,220
Speaker 1: I'm like, well, you know, I'll lose my problem with that.

216
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,819
Speaker 0: Is that if you want if you have a cheap mattress, then, yeah, like that artificial mattress pad, like pillow top cover, you need that.

217
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:27,040
Speaker 0: But if you have a mattress that already has the pillow top on it and you don't care that it's eventually going to have the vague color of body oil in the part you sleep on, I think is I have a mattress pad.

218
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,157
Speaker 1: He was trying to sell me a mattress pad for like 70 bucks.

219
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,404
Speaker 1: That was all fancy.

220
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:38,980
Speaker 1: And the thing was that mattress pad, a lot of the features of it that he claimed were duplicated in my already, you know, existing mattress.

221
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,300
Speaker 0: I got a waterproof mattress.

222
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,582
Speaker 1: No, not the waterproof part, but like, you know, the anti allergen dust mite parts, whatever.

223
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,579
Speaker 1: I just ignored that anyway, but because I don't need that.

224
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,222
Speaker 0: But regardless, I like you had to throw that in there just in case, like, oh, but I don't need that.

225
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:51,583
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:58,019
Speaker 1: So I think is I'll just buy the same kind of mattress pad that I already have for a lot less than seventy dollars.

227
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,860
Speaker 1: So I was like, no, no mattress pad.

228
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:02,320
Speaker 1: Just deliver this to my apartment.

229
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:03,127
Speaker 1: So thank you.

230
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:04,500
Speaker 0: Fascinating.

231
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:04,861
Speaker 0: Yeah.

232
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,218
Speaker 1: But yeah, free naps.

233
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:13,919
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, until they realize you're not actually buying a mattress, then they don't let you back into the store, different disguise every day.

234
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:15,937
Speaker 0: I don't have that many disguises.

235
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:21,242
Speaker 1: Oh, go to different mattress stores like consecutive days with a disguise and rotate it around.

236
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,220
Speaker 0: So anyway, you know, it's Thursday.

237
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,440
Speaker 0: We always try to make Thursday just fun and mixed up.

238
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,204
Speaker 0: And we don't have to.

239
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,945
Speaker 0: it's not like we have to follow the format and do the news and all the stuff we normally do.

240
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:34,919
Speaker 0: And it's time to do the book club, which we should have done last Thursday's show.

241
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:40,721
Speaker 0: But I know I called Scott's bluff because he was like, well, I think the book will be done.

242
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:44,020
Speaker 0: I'll finish it and we'll do the book club the next gig nights Thursday.

243
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,805
Speaker 0: And I was like, OK.

244
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,762
Speaker 0: And I didn't even bother finishing the book because I assume Scott wouldn't.

245
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,299
Speaker 0: And then Scott finished the book and I didn't.

246
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,331
Speaker 1: So that's right.

247
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:51,979
Speaker 0: I had to.

248
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:53,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

249
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:53,206
Speaker 0: Yeah.

250
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:54,739
Speaker 1: So I made you look like a fool.

251
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I finished the book anyway.

252
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,139
Speaker 1: The long delayed book club.

253
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:02,520
Speaker 1: I feel like we haven't done any Thursday episodes other than book clubs.

254
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,059
Speaker 1: Like we just keep skipping Thursdays.

255
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,780
Speaker 0: I said we haven't done the book club in forever.

256
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,900
Speaker 0: And I how many of you actually read Stephen Wolf?

257
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:15,539
Speaker 1: I think the thing is, from now on, starting today during the meta moment, I met a minute, whatever you want to call it.

258
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,050
Speaker 1: Metamucil.

259
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:16,460
Speaker 1: Right.

260
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,960
Speaker 1: I'm going to keep saying that during the meta segment of our show, I'm going to announce the book club book every single show speaking.

261
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,240
Speaker 0: I think that will help of which it's your turn to pick.

262
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,248
Speaker 0: What is the next book club?

263
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,500
Speaker 1: Well, we'll talk about that later.

264
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,939
Speaker 0: Oh, we're going to the second half now.

265
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,341
Speaker 0: Yeah.

266
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:36,818
Speaker 1: So anyway, we read Steppenwolf now by what I want to say.

267
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,140
Speaker 1: OK, I hope that's all you with that pronunciation.

268
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,840
Speaker 0: Somebody emailed us and said Ehrman essay.

269
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:50,375
Speaker 1: But yes, no, but someone emailed us who was like a scholar in this sort of, you know, in this German literature.

270
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:50,659
Speaker 1: Right.

271
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:54,140
Speaker 1: So I am not, you know, putting them down in any way.

272
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,860
Speaker 1: In fact, I think that's totally awesome.

273
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,160
Speaker 1: And I totally respect everything that they have to say about this book.

274
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:06,425
Speaker 0: You know, that is pretty much the standard boilerplate for dudes about to get punched intellectually.

275
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,258
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

276
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,046
Speaker 1: The thing is, right.

277
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:16,860
Speaker 1: He was like basically in his email was like, you have to let me come on the episode where you talk about the show so I can talk about all these intellectual bits that you won't understand.

278
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:21,969
Speaker 1: Just reading it once without, you know, the meta context of, you know, the scholarly knowledges and all that.

279
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,200
Speaker 1: And you know what?

280
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,327
Speaker 1: He's probably exactly right.

281
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:26,180
Speaker 1: There's probably a whole bunch of shit we don't know.

282
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:30,767
Speaker 1: We're going to sound like complete morons if like a literature scholar listens to this episode.

283
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:31,820
Speaker 1: That's all correct.

284
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:44,340
Speaker 1: The thing is, uh, the Geek Nights Book Club, the goal is get people to read because people don't read books anymore as much read a book.

285
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:45,183
Speaker 1: Exactly.

286
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:55,860
Speaker 1: So and I think that talking about a book in the scholarly way that we would appreciate as smart peoples that we are, would not really do such a good job of getting illiterates.

287
00:15:56,402 --> 00:16:06,665
Speaker 0: Scott, I will say this, you know what you've actually just said, what I am here by covering my ass to make sure that no one realizes that I did not analyze this book in any depth.

288
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:07,939
Speaker 1: I analyze it in depth.

289
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:16,880
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that I want to get the guy to do to talk about all the scholarliness on another episode and not this episode.

290
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,663
Speaker 0: I do agree with that.

291
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:23,480
Speaker 0: I want to split up because it's kind of like I read Steppenwolf, not necessarily from the academic perspective.

292
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:31,269
Speaker 0: Like if I was reading a book to analyze, like I used to do in high school and college or with certain books that I reread, like The Prince of Nothing, I'll sit there and like I'll analyze.

293
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,860
Speaker 0: I'll take notes.

294
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,140
Speaker 0: I'll think I'll try to like, oh, well, he quoted this.

295
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,680
Speaker 0: I wonder if it was referencing this earlier and all that sort of stuff.

296
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,400
Speaker 0: But I read this the way I would approach reading like any fiction novel.

297
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:43,080
Speaker 0: I just read it straight up, just go, let's go.

298
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,926
Speaker 0: I didn't go back.

299
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,760
Speaker 0: I didn't find quotes again or anything.

300
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,240
Speaker 0: And I just have my straight up unadulterated opinion.

301
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,639
Speaker 0: I never read this book in school.

302
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,280
Speaker 0: I never had anyone like analyze it for me or explain anything for me.

303
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,379
Speaker 0: I even avoided looking at the Wikipedia page.

304
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't look at the Wikipedia page at all.

305
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,819
Speaker 1: I know nothing about this book other than what was in the book.

306
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:10,663
Speaker 0: So I want to point out before we continue, if you have not already read Steppenwolf, stop listening, because we're about to talk about Steppenwolf as though you've already read it.

307
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,519
Speaker 1: Can we really spoil Steppenwolf?

308
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:21,790
Speaker 0: I mean, I kind of even then if someone listens, I'm not going to be like, so the plot was that there was this man named Herman Allen stabs a bitch.

309
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:24,888
Speaker 0: The end.

310
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:25,115
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:34,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, but just warning, we're going to spoil this book and it's not that spoilable, but I'd recommend you read it before you listen to what we're about to say.

312
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:36,083
Speaker 1: Right.

313
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:40,000
Speaker 0: So the first thing I want to jump right into the pretty much the biggest part.

314
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:41,840
Speaker 0: I don't think Hermione was real.

315
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,979
Speaker 0: I think that was just all in his head the whole time.

316
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:46,208
Speaker 1: You don't think what was real?

317
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,980
Speaker 0: The girl, the main character girl.

318
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:51,219
Speaker 0: I don't think there was any from the very beginning when he first met her.

319
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,960
Speaker 1: I was the way you said her name.

320
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,740
Speaker 1: I guess I was mispronouncing your name where you are on her mind.

321
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:56,752
Speaker 0: What are you going to call her?

322
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:57,259
Speaker 1: I don't know.

323
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,928
Speaker 1: Herman.

324
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:58,659
Speaker 0: Her many.

325
00:17:59,563 --> 00:18:00,189
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

326
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,320
Speaker 0: I go with Hermione.

327
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,053
Speaker 1: OK, whatever.

328
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:07,260
Speaker 0: That's probably just like hung himself.

329
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:07,761
Speaker 1: Yeah.

330
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:08,023
Speaker 1: Right.

331
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,860
Speaker 1: But that's actually that gives us a good tangent.

332
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,102
Speaker 1: Right.

333
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:13,420
Speaker 1: This book is really written in German.

334
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:13,781
Speaker 1: Right.

335
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,360
Speaker 1: We're reading a translation.

336
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:16,491
Speaker 1: Is that correct?

337
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:16,693
Speaker 0: Yes.

338
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:17,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

339
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:20,880
Speaker 1: So, I mean, I wonder what was lost in translation here.

340
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:22,280
Speaker 1: Obviously something.

341
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,204
Speaker 1: I mean, there's parts in this book where there are like poems and rhymes and various things of that nature.

342
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:31,842
Speaker 1: You know, how well were those translated from, you know, the original?

343
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:45,842
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I was like every time something like that came up, a poem or a rhyme or something or some song lyrics or anything along those lines, like I always just thought like, huh, I wonder what I'm missing here, that it not being in German.

344
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,720
Speaker 0: Well, here's a note from the translation.

345
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:56,060
Speaker 0: This is the first revised edition of Basil Creighton's translation of 1929.

346
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,302
Speaker 0: Whoa.

347
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,740
Speaker 0: That's good in a way, because it was contemporary English.

348
00:18:59,341 --> 00:18:59,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

349
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,980
Speaker 0: In the revision, we were intent on a more exact.

350
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,801
Speaker 0: So they revised it in 1963.

351
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:05,711
Speaker 0: But the base is the 1929 one.

352
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,140
Speaker 0: We exact and more readily understood rendition.

353
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,499
Speaker 0: British spellings and idioms have been Americanized.

354
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:17,764
Speaker 0: Germanisms removed, awkward sentences improved and misleading translations corrected.

355
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,000
Speaker 1: I want the Germanisms, though.

356
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,944
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yeah.

357
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:23,900
Speaker 0: But how are you going to go down the road of the fan subs?

358
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,640
Speaker 1: No, but I just wonder what I'm missing.

359
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:35,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I feel in any translated work, if you really if you go beyond, I mean, let's be perfectly honest here, right?

360
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:43,040
Speaker 1: What's lost in translation matters a lot more in a great literary work than it does in an anime, even if it's a great anime.

361
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,967
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

362
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:44,312
Speaker 1: Right.

363
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:44,860
Speaker 1: Seriously.

364
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:45,482
Speaker 1: Yeah.

365
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:54,559
Speaker 0: So well, what I would just say is that if you're going to take any work seriously, like if you really like if Steppenwolf meant something to you beyond just being a novel, you got to learn German and read in German.

366
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:06,260
Speaker 0: Well, what I would recommend is in the very least read of any work like this, a literal kind of translation and independently of that, a kind of like modernly rendered, you know, proper translation.

367
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,680
Speaker 1: Not a bad idea either.

368
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:09,323
Speaker 1: Yeah.

369
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:19,182
Speaker 1: Usually reading multiple translations, you can sort of add them together and sort of sort of infer what the original route was that someone could translate in those two different ways.

370
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:39,520
Speaker 0: But pretty much from the beginning, I just I figured that she was completely in his head and that was all just either in his head or in the very least he was you know, the character was taking his experience and writing about it as though the experience, everything was this girl, you know, because this is all read by the other main character nominally.

371
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,826
Speaker 1: Well, yes, that's the thing, right?

372
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,537
Speaker 1: You look at this book as a whole, right?

373
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:50,660
Speaker 1: And what really drew me into the book was that first part where you have the guy talking about the Steppenwolf who lived in his same apartment building as he was.

374
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:51,043
Speaker 1: Right.

375
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:53,520
Speaker 1: And that part was pretty awesome.

376
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:58,100
Speaker 1: And then the rest of the book is not the Steppenwolf talking directly.

377
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:03,060
Speaker 1: But this dude read, you know, reading the memoirs that the Steppenwolf left behind.

378
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,022
Speaker 1: And he even says straight up like, yeah, I think a lot of the stuff in here is obviously not real.

379
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:18,298
Speaker 1: And I basically assumed like, OK, not all this anything in it that happens here that is fantastic in any sort of way is obviously not real.

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,342
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

381
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:23,940
Speaker 0: But I'll go one step further and say that even the non fantastic meeting with this girl was completely.

382
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,954
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, as soon as he pretty much from the point in the.

383
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,504
Speaker 1: Memoirs where he like started seeing like the words appear like, you know, not for everyone.

384
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:36,720
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, it's not from here on out.

385
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,462
Speaker 1: Everything's fake.

386
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,229
Speaker 0: We'll see

387
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,976
Speaker 1: hints of truth here and there, like

388
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:55,071
Speaker 0: having read other works by the author, I just I kind of got this impression that the intent there was to kind of express the this meta intent, the intent of the Steppenwolf, the guy writing this memoir, was that he had a profound revelation.

389
00:21:55,653 --> 00:22:05,319
Speaker 0: and the profound revelation, if he had just explained the revelation, would not have felt so profound to someone analyzing it or reading about it, who didn't actually experience it.

390
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:19,119
Speaker 0: So he translated his, you know, internal experience into this fantastical experience in order to express upon other people just the gravity of the feeling that he felt and the gravity of what happened to his life in his mind.

391
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,740
Speaker 0: So, you know, he didn't literally find a magic theater.

392
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:29,302
Speaker 0: He had some revelation that would have felt like finding a magical theater that opens your mind.

393
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:36,740
Speaker 1: And I think I think the part where he went to the to the professor's house, that was probably that was one of my favorite scenes.

394
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,423
Speaker 1: That was pretty good.

395
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,733
Speaker 1: That was probably actually a mostly.

396
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:42,780
Speaker 1: I mean, like we talk about this, like, oh, that part was real.

397
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,424
Speaker 1: That part wasn't.

398
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:45,640
Speaker 1: the whole book is a work of fiction, right?

399
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,199
Speaker 1: It's one of those books in a book.

400
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:51,260
Speaker 1: And the thing is, the book in a book always feel you think that would be sort of cliche.

401
00:22:51,781 --> 00:23:00,080
Speaker 1: But every time I see the book in a book or even the book in a book in a book, which I have seen, it's out there, it works like really well.

402
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,176
Speaker 1: I guess it's because nobody dares to do it unless they they're going to do it.

403
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,081
Speaker 1: well, you know.

404
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:09,459
Speaker 0: But that's that whole scene where he sees that painting of Goeth and he's just like, fuck you painting.

405
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,862
Speaker 0: But actually, the reason I like that scene, too, is the thing is, I can really identify with that.

406
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:21,845
Speaker 1: You like how many times I see a painting of like some old historic character or a fictional character.

407
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:24,379
Speaker 1: And I'm like, that's not what the fuck that dude looks like.

408
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,686
Speaker 1: But that wasn't his feeling.

409
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:33,840
Speaker 0: It was more it was such a complex feeling that at first he appreciates the painting and then he goes through these different like he and like he sees the painting and all these different layers.

410
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,464
Speaker 0: And every time he peels away a layer, he gets more and more pissed off about the painting.

411
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:53,760
Speaker 0: But that scene, too, is up until that point, the book pulls a couple of switcheroos on the Steppenwolf, because first, from the perspective of the dude just reading the memoir, you know, that bourgeois guy reading the memoir, the Steppenwolf is this fascinating and alluring character.

412
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,760
Speaker 0: And he seems cool.

413
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,887
Speaker 0: He seems powerful.

414
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:58,640
Speaker 0: You think that is a man.

415
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,222
Speaker 0: Look at that.

416
00:23:59,383 --> 00:23:59,504
Speaker 1: Yeah.

417
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:14,288
Speaker 1: I mean, like, look at what the dude says about the Steppenwolf in the scene where they're like both in the music house and this or no, when they both go to see the lecturer and Steppenwolf gives them a look and he's like, oh, that look is incredibly powerful.

418
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:16,159
Speaker 1: Look, that's, you know, said so much.

419
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,544
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

420
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:20,540
Speaker 0: And then you get you get inside the Steppenwolf's head with his memoir.

421
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:23,020
Speaker 0: And again, like, oh, it's a man of two natures.

422
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,879
Speaker 0: You feel like you're going along a certain way.

423
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,300
Speaker 0: And then you find the Steppenwolf treatise and it's basically like, yeah, stupid old Steppenwolf making bullshit up in your head.

424
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,772
Speaker 0: That's all just crap.

425
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:34,478
Speaker 0: And you know it.

426
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:35,383
Speaker 1: Yeah.

427
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,480
Speaker 1: I liked how, you know, it was totally right.

428
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,920
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, you sort of prevent for they present you with this analogy of, you know, that the the duality of the wolf and the man and whatever.

429
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:45,724
Speaker 1: And then.

430
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:45,965
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:53,417
Speaker 1: And then the Steppenwolf book, the Steppenwolf treatise shows up and is like, look, is actually like a thousand bajillion components to the man.

432
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,368
Speaker 1: that are all, you know, blah, blah, blah.

433
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:57,120
Speaker 1: It's like you can't possibly even understand.

434
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,987
Speaker 1: It's so complex.

435
00:24:58,047 --> 00:24:59,300
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, yeah, that's right.

436
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,100
Speaker 1: It's like someone gives you an analogy.

437
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:07,927
Speaker 1: And then, you know, at least in the book, they can just make this fictional world match that analogy.

438
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:09,279
Speaker 1: So you totally buy into it.

439
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,180
Speaker 1: And then they sort of just like hit you over the head to remind you.

440
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,680
Speaker 1: It's like, no, shit ain't that simple.

441
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,103
Speaker 1: Stupid.

442
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,660
Speaker 1: It's like but then it was very refreshing.

443
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:25,360
Speaker 0: Even then, you still you know, the way he reacts to the treatise and all that, you still feel like they're all these scenes where you feel like he's a a powerful and enigmatic and cool figure in general.

444
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,923
Speaker 0: But the scene where he just kind of loses his cool and yells at the professor and like all of that together.

445
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:46,960
Speaker 0: And as the book goes on, you start to realize that, no, he's kind of just a jerk and a loner and he did it all to himself and he works himself up into these just fevers of just I don't know, he gets mad about stupid things for no good reason.

446
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,963
Speaker 0: He blames it on himself and he's Steppenwolf and he's not a very likable fellow, both within and without.

447
00:25:53,083 --> 00:26:01,700
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the thing that I thought is like, you know, they build him up sort of early on, you know, they show him like saying really wise things like what was that really wise thing?

448
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,804
Speaker 0: He said, oh, God, as the beginning, never, never have I read a book more quotable than this book.

449
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:09,700
Speaker 0: But there are quotes that you have to memorize.

450
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:20,759
Speaker 1: They're like paragraph long quotation, just like my favorite one was still that one that was in the introductory part, like talking about men who live in their time and before their time and after their time.

451
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,303
Speaker 1: No, but about, you know, men were made for land, you know, and that was the analogy at the end of that.

452
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:33,060
Speaker 0: But the whole thing before that was that, you know, the men who suffer, those who were born before the time where they would, you know, that's right.

453
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

454
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:34,006
Speaker 1: That one, too.

455
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,679
Speaker 1: Both of those pretty much.

456
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:37,766
Speaker 1: I sort of feel like that.

457
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:43,170
Speaker 1: both of those are what the books about, but regardless, the I forget what I was saying.

458
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:44,000
Speaker 1: Right.

459
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,522
Speaker 1: All right.

460
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:44,844
Speaker 1: All right.

461
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,980
Speaker 1: Like men were made for, you know, the land.

462
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,045
Speaker 1: And if you go into the sea and the sea, if you go in the sea, then you'll you know, you'll eventually drown.

463
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,757
Speaker 1: And how I forget how much I had the exact quote.

464
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:57,989
Speaker 1: and on the book in front of me, I thought about getting all the.

465
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:00,503
Speaker 0: early on when I was reading, I was thinking, oh, that's a good quote.

466
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:01,126
Speaker 0: I was noting them.

467
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:06,200
Speaker 1: all like these are things I want to bring up, but not things that you can say quickly, like I Caramba.

468
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:18,562
Speaker 0: Well, not only that, I realized that this book is one of those quotation per page books where it's just insight upon insight upon insight and quotation upon quotation upon quotation.

469
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:24,962
Speaker 0: And there are so many just half paragraph long aphorisms that I don't know what to say.

470
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:25,566
Speaker 0: They're brilliant.

471
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:29,720
Speaker 0: I just have to memorize them all because there is a quote for every occasion in Steppenwolf.

472
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,510
Speaker 1: If you need to put someone down, it's like Queen, they got a song for every possible scenario.

473
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,440
Speaker 0: It's exactly that.

474
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:45,643
Speaker 0: If you need to be able to just trump anyone in any kind of philosophical argument, there is a Steppenwolf quote for you that will be relevant to whatever it is that you're talking about.

475
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,440
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things like that.

476
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,308
Speaker 1: I mean, you could probably do the same with like a playdoh, you know, you just any situation.

477
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:52,279
Speaker 1: I got a playdoh for that.

478
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,841
Speaker 1: Watch out.

479
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:57,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Steppenwolf ones are more pragmatically relevant to the real world.

480
00:27:57,963 --> 00:27:59,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's weird.

481
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:10,987
Speaker 1: It feels like the book is set up in a way at least that like I feel like, you know, it's like you read it and there are certain parts that you can like strongly relate to and there are certain parts that you don't.

482
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:17,844
Speaker 1: But I sort of feel like the book was constructed so that no matter who you are, if you read it, you're going to strongly relate to some portion of it.

483
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:22,384
Speaker 0: Well, I think that's why on purpose people seem to really have very mixed feelings about this book.

484
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:27,999
Speaker 0: And a lot of people identify with it in basically completely opposite ways for the completely opposite reasons.

485
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:39,340
Speaker 0: I think it's because the idea of the Steppenwolf, like the idea of what he is, feels very alluring because it's almost this cop out, this answer like, ah, that explains me.

486
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:40,789
Speaker 0: I feel like the Steppenwolf.

487
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:42,440
Speaker 0: sometimes I feel like the outsider.

488
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:50,780
Speaker 1: That's the thing is they show you the Steppenwolf feeling so many different ways that you felt some of those ways before, no matter who you are, if you're a human being.

489
00:28:51,302 --> 00:29:05,240
Speaker 1: And you sort of identify with those commonalities you have with the Steppenwolf and then those, you know, the things that you have in common with the Steppenwolf, you know, sort of grow larger in your view of him and the things you don't have in common with him sort of grow smaller.

490
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:07,720
Speaker 1: So then he just looks like you no matter who you are.

491
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,839
Speaker 1: But he looks different to every person because every person is a different person.

492
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,161
Speaker 0: Yep.

493
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:15,924
Speaker 0: And you could go one step further and say that the book means whatever you really wanted it to mean.

494
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:16,386
Speaker 0: But it does.

495
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:24,984
Speaker 0: it does it kind of cleverly where I could see people seeing the end of this book as a tragedy and as a victory, like I could see both interpretations.

496
00:29:25,326 --> 00:29:28,771
Speaker 0: And I think it's really just a reflection of what kind of person you are as to how you take it.

497
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:29,179
Speaker 1: Yeah.

498
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,000
Speaker 1: The thing is, I took it sort of like in this weird, completely neutral way.

499
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:36,853
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I just didn't like.

500
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,320
Speaker 0: I took it that I took it.

501
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:47,901
Speaker 0: I felt a lot at the end of the book, probably the same way Mozart felt about the Steppenwolf at the end of the book, just shaking your head like, dude, you just didn't get it.

502
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,080
Speaker 1: That was so weird when the Mozart showed up.

503
00:29:51,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Speaker 1: That was great because because it was kind of like I just I just like imagined it like this crazy movie, like like suddenly Mozart appears and like I imagine I got my imagination of it was like completely unlike what was actually written.

504
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,089
Speaker 1: Like I saw them like sitting like in chairs somewhere with like stars everywhere, like they were in outer space or something.

505
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,580
Speaker 0: I got that exact same vibe.

506
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,146
Speaker 0: Really?

507
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:11,814
Speaker 0: And I think why?

508
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:20,942
Speaker 0: Because he hinted this all the time and it was when he looked at that painting of Goeth and then later when he, you know, he talks about the celestial immortality and all those things.

509
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,560
Speaker 0: There is that feeling and I know you've experienced it.

510
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,404
Speaker 0: I know I've experienced.

511
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,114
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people have experienced it where you.

512
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:32,527
Speaker 0: it's easy to forget that the immortals of the world and when I say immortals, I mean, you know, really.

513
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

514
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Speaker 0: People who effectively became immortal through their works, though not obviously living forever somewhere in a bunker.

515
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,708
Speaker 1: Elvis.

516
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:41,179
Speaker 0: Yes.

517
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,023
Speaker 0: Not like Elvis.

518
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:58,200
Speaker 0: But the whole the idea that is very easy to forget that they were people and to something to esteem upon their works, almost undo praise, maybe not undo is not the word, but it's almost easy to feel that they were transcendent geniuses.

519
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,159
Speaker 0: They perceive the world beyond what anyone today could or beyond what I could, that they're beyond me.

520
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,060
Speaker 0: And to strive for genius is to strive for this unattainable, peaceful, the celestial laughter of the sky and all those sorts of things.

521
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:20,660
Speaker 0: And you see the step of doing that, like he envisions these people, like he hates that painting of Goeth, but that's exactly how he sees Mozart.

522
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:23,840
Speaker 0: His mental picture of Mozart is the same as that painting.

523
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,765
Speaker 0: And he didn't realize it.

524
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:27,360
Speaker 0: And then he meets Mozart and Mozart.

525
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,340
Speaker 1: Mozart is just totally normal, like a jerk like everybody.

526
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mozart was a jerk like everyone.

527
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:49,458
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, whenever I start to like, you know, like praise famous people in that sort of way, which I do on occasion, you know, like raise, you know, these these sort of figures up to like a above human level, you can always think about Van Gogh is just completely nuts.

528
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:51,539
Speaker 1: But and that brings me back down.

529
00:31:51,901 --> 00:32:01,844
Speaker 0: I think that's why we both pictured the same idea of like Mozart and all these people kind of sitting serenely among the stars, laughing the laughter of the immortals and this sort of.

530
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:03,420
Speaker 0: and that's what the Steppenwolf felt.

531
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,739
Speaker 0: And he felt like that's what he was striving for.

532
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,199
Speaker 0: And that's what he had to do.

533
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,156
Speaker 1: They were laughing at him, not with him.

534
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:15,520
Speaker 0: Except that's literally because that is kind of the point of the book.

535
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:22,080
Speaker 0: I think that, you know, Mozart was a normal person and he got the world.

536
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,607
Speaker 0: He got it.

537
00:32:22,627 --> 00:32:23,338
Speaker 0: He laughed at it.

538
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,240
Speaker 0: At least Mozart of this book.

539
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:26,419
Speaker 0: Maybe not the real Mozart.

540
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it depends on what version of Mozart you're looking at.

541
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:34,020
Speaker 1: Oh, I could Salieri genius.

542
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:39,519
Speaker 0: These are originals.

543
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:43,763
Speaker 1: OK.

544
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,236
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

545
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,898
Speaker 0: But that whole scene at the end, it actually reminded me I don't actually I got to.

546
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:50,682
Speaker 0: I need some help.

547
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,280
Speaker 0: Listeners, I saw something when I was a kid.

548
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,720
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was a film, a short film.

549
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,419
Speaker 0: I have no idea what it was.

550
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:10,942
Speaker 0: But it kept cutting between this old man talking about how he realized that he can sharpen pencils with a knife rather than using a pencil sharpener by just going around the edge with the knife.

551
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:22,920
Speaker 0: And these clowns in like this World War One prison and they kept making jokes and it ended with the clown giving the greatest joke of all.

552
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:25,160
Speaker 0: And he says he's going to do a magic trick for everyone.

553
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,920
Speaker 0: And then they put him up against the wall and they shoot him and he just dies.

554
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:29,885
Speaker 0: And that was the trick.

555
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,299
Speaker 0: And I have no idea what this was.

556
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:35,680
Speaker 0: And like I have these student film.

557
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:37,029
Speaker 0: No, it was on TV, whatever.

558
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:44,899
Speaker 0: But I was the whole end of Steppenwolf from the murder cars all the way to the end.

559
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:49,460
Speaker 0: I couldn't think of anything but this film and I have no idea what it is.

560
00:33:49,883 --> 00:33:52,018
Speaker 0: And I wish I had more to explain, but I don't.

561
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,039
Speaker 0: There's a tank in it at one point, like World War One kind of tank.

562
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:58,280
Speaker 1: I think one thing that was weird for me was that like murder cars.

563
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,822
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

564
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:08,971
Speaker 1: Like earlier in the book, I sort of you know, I sort of was imagining like an older time, like, you know, obviously, I mean, what's the time period for this is like earlier 1900s, I'm guessing.

565
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,918
Speaker 0: The book was written, you know, between World War One and World War Two.

566
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,402
Speaker 0: Right.

567
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:13,683
Speaker 1: Right.

568
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:17,684
Speaker 1: But I was sort of like imagining it in like an almost like almost a Victorian world.

569
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:21,460
Speaker 1: Like I was imagining shit being old, like way, you know, much older.

570
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:35,300
Speaker 1: And then like as the book got later on, you know, it's like the time, at least in the imagining in my head, like pushed it way up, like I was almost imagining like, you know, the 20s, you know, which I guess is what it's supposed to be.

571
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

572
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:42,480
Speaker 1: So it's like the way there was something about, you know, it you know, it started when like you met the girl and that sort of thing.

573
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,040
Speaker 1: You know, the book like the time just fast forward in my head, sort of imagining like a different time period.

574
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:50,940
Speaker 0: Well, I feel the book was very timeless.

575
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,960
Speaker 0: And I think ahead of its time in its perception of technology and the future.

576
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:07,920
Speaker 0: I mean, murder car aside, that whole part near the end where there was the talk of like modern world and the changing world and the whole idea that every generation feels like this is the end and everything's coming to chaos.

577
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:08,918
Speaker 0: That was true.

578
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:17,482
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's one thing we know that it's one of those things where, you know, that I know that the world's not falling apart anymore now than it was during the Greek Dark Ages.

579
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:22,723
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it really was falling apart during the Greek Dark Ages, but it was a renaissance.

580
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:26,821
Speaker 0: But that aside, like the whole every generation, like everything's falling apart.

581
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:43,313
Speaker 0: And yet to read the feeling of that in a book from the 30s to so literally see someone describing the decay of society exactly the way someone like me would feel it and describe it today in almost the exact same words, more

582
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:45,362
Speaker 1: shit changes, more shit stays the same.

583
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:51,090
Speaker 0: That whole murder car segment and the whole thing where Mozart pulls out the crappy gramophone.

584
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,360
Speaker 0: He's like, listen to that.

585
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:54,639
Speaker 0: You can still hear the music even through the static.

586
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:55,443
Speaker 1: Yep.

587
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,240
Speaker 1: That was that part with the gramophone.

588
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,640
Speaker 1: That was fucking sweet.

589
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,360
Speaker 1: That was brilliant because I was like, hells yeah.

590
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,219
Speaker 1: You know, there's the obvious surface level shit of shut the fuck up audio files.

591
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,380
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's like it's so true.

592
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:18,500
Speaker 1: It's not the the actual, you know, the the the like the the details of the sensory input that really matter.

593
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:21,420
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you can dance to it just as well.

594
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:28,040
Speaker 1: If it's, you know, full of static as if it's not as long as it's dance, as long as the signal is coming through, it's all good.

595
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:30,080
Speaker 0: You know, you can leave your friends behind.

596
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:30,721
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:35,761
Speaker 1: And that, you know, that analogy is good for, you know, so many different kinds of messages.

598
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:37,955
Speaker 0: I think it was a broader metaphor, though, for it was.

599
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,542
Speaker 0: it was back to the whole Mozart thing of.

600
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:47,660
Speaker 0: he imagines this perfect clarity of, you know, the immortals of Mozart, of these people, of these achievements of genius.

601
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:58,219
Speaker 0: And he doesn't realize that the real world is full of static and noise and that nothing's ever as clear cut and perfect as he wants it to be in his head.

602
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:04,724
Speaker 0: And in the real world, you have to just accept the static and listen for the music behind the static.

603
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:08,823
Speaker 0: But if you look for just the music and you issue the static, you'll never find anything.

604
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:15,000
Speaker 0: And you'll die and boring old lonely man who may or may not have had gay orgy sex while taking cocaine.

605
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:16,638
Speaker 1: May or may not.

606
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:33,862
Speaker 0: Actually, a funny moment when he when when he was talking to Hermione about Maria, who I want to talk about her separately, and he there's the point at which he's asking her like Maria tells him about something or Hermione tells him about some like technique of kissing that Maria

607
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:34,183
Speaker 1: had

608
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,897
Speaker 0: and they talk about it and they're like, oh, no, we can't.

609
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:39,248
Speaker 0: we can't talk about that yet.

610
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:40,159
Speaker 0: We're not lovers yet.

611
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:48,780
Speaker 0: And then he thinks about it for a second and he wonders how the two girls would be so acquainted with each other's ways of loving.

612
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,780
Speaker 0: And there's a sentence somewhere near the end of that chapter where he's basically like.

613
00:37:53,302 --> 00:38:02,018
Speaker 0: and then the Stephen Wolf considered these brave new ramifications of the world or something like that, which is this kind of thinly veiled lesbian joke that was I found.

614
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,184
Speaker 0: I laughed out loud.

615
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:06,442
Speaker 1: One thing that I've noticed and I sort of have a theory about this, right.

616
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:23,300
Speaker 1: All the literature is that I read, you know, when I was you know, when I was in school, most of the books that I read that were highbrow or because school told me to and, you know, sexy parts were there, but not often for, you know, school politically correct bullshit reasons.

617
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:23,801
Speaker 1: Right.

618
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:35,959
Speaker 1: And I've sort of noticed that, like almost all of the highbrow books I've read in college and then since usually have some strong sexual elements to them.

619
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:46,543
Speaker 1: And I think pretty much like I'm getting the feeling is my theory that all the highbrow literature has strong sexual elements and that schools are basically like desperate.

620
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:50,002
Speaker 1: They pretty much give you all the ones that don't, which is pretty much all they got.

621
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:55,256
Speaker 1: That's why everyone reads all the same books in high school because the only ones that are not offensive.

622
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:59,960
Speaker 0: Sadly, I'm very surprised that more high school.

623
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,023
Speaker 0: I mean, this would be Stephen Wolf is like the perfect book to give to like a senior high school class.

624
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:10,680
Speaker 1: I read Siddhartha as a senior in high school, same dude, but that didn't have nearly as much sexiness in it.

625
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,391
Speaker 0: I got to read that again.

626
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:11,939
Speaker 0: That was a good book.

627
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:12,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was good.

628
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:13,359
Speaker 1: I like that one.

629
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,499
Speaker 1: I like it better than this one.

630
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:15,206
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

631
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:16,760
Speaker 0: See, I got to read Demian again.

632
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,340
Speaker 0: I don't know Demian more or not.

633
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,220
Speaker 1: So I mean, as as something to read, to enjoy.

634
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,420
Speaker 1: I mean, like I didn't really enjoy Stephen Wolf that much.

635
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,760
Speaker 1: Like, it's not something I would read because I want to, you know, it wasn't like fun or pleasant, but I thought it both fun and pleasant.

636
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:39,719
Speaker 1: It was it was intellectually stimulating and it wasn't intellectually draining, which is which a lot of things are.

637
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,000
Speaker 1: It was a book that that's a point in its favor, but it wasn't like a pleasure.

638
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:47,461
Speaker 0: It was a book that really forced me to analyze a lot of things about myself, to be honest.

639
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:54,319
Speaker 0: And while I didn't necessarily change any of my opinions, I analyzed them and I thought about a lot of kind of very personal, internal things.

640
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:57,259
Speaker 1: I also do that with any book that doesn't suck.

641
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:01,280
Speaker 0: I also I didn't analyze anything in myself when I read Hyperion.

642
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,251
Speaker 0: It was a good book, but it was.

643
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,300
Speaker 0: it was not an introspective book.

644
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:07,898
Speaker 0: It was an extrospective book.

645
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:12,839
Speaker 1: I did a little bit when I was thinking about the the console guy.

646
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:23,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, no, the only inward looking thing I thought at the end of that, not to not to spoil, but when you find out who the traitor is, the first thing I thought was the fuck is wrong with me that I didn't see this guy.

647
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:26,932
Speaker 0: Like I just I draw.

648
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:27,740
Speaker 0: I sat the book down.

649
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,920
Speaker 0: I'm like, am I that stupid?

650
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:30,280
Speaker 0: Am I really that stupid?

651
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,764
Speaker 1: Yes.

652
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:32,018
Speaker 0: And yes, we all are.

653
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,521
Speaker 1: All right.

654
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:46,654
Speaker 0: But I feel like if I had read Steppenwolf when I was younger, I might have turned out slightly differently because I was closer to being the Steppenwolf when I was younger than I am now.

655
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:59,079
Speaker 0: Perhaps I'm talking like if I had read this in like middle school, I would have been a slightly different person or in the very least, I think I would have become the person I am now more rapidly than I did.

656
00:41:00,143 --> 00:41:01,820
Speaker 1: Maybe the thing is, it's weird.

657
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:11,080
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I've obviously consumed a great deal of media in all mediums, right, that are available to us as, you know, human beings.

658
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:25,540
Speaker 1: And while there is no doubt that many of them have probably changed who I am or contributed to me being the way I am today, I can't actually make a lot of like direct connections like because I read that book at that time.

659
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,959
Speaker 1: That's why I do this.

660
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,720
Speaker 1: I can't really do any of it's weird.

661
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:35,540
Speaker 0: I can, but only in retrospect, like, you know, I watched Captain Tyler a long time ago and I missed a bunch of episodes and all that.

662
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,699
Speaker 0: But I watching it again now.

663
00:41:38,341 --> 00:41:42,200
Speaker 0: It's almost frightening to see how influential it probably was on me.

664
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:48,900
Speaker 1: I think that is maybe if I did like reread something that I read way back and then remembered when I read it originally.

665
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,459
Speaker 0: I think that's what you have to do.

666
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't do a lot of that, though.

667
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Speaker 1: I try to always get something new because, you know, I try not to do repeats, especially on something as, you know, time consuming as a book.

668
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:00,320
Speaker 0: It's so difficult, though.

669
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,440
Speaker 1: I mean, my coworker, this book is time consuming.

670
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,399
Speaker 1: I read it in a few days.

671
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,160
Speaker 0: My coworker watched some Cowboy Bebop and he was like, man, that scene.

672
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,320
Speaker 0: And he started talking about a scene.

673
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:12,680
Speaker 0: And all I could think was I got to watch Cowboy Bebop again.

674
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,500
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

675
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,783
Speaker 1: I started rewatching it again like some months ago, but then I stopped before I finished it.

676
00:42:18,026 --> 00:42:19,298
Speaker 0: I think I'm going to rewatch it again.

677
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,260
Speaker 1: I already did that recently.

678
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,339
Speaker 1: I watched the whole thing on the train some months ago.

679
00:42:24,482 --> 00:42:26,500
Speaker 1: Anything else you got to say about Der Steppenwolf?

680
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,357
Speaker 0: Murder car.

681
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,366
Speaker 1: Murder car.

682
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:33,104
Speaker 1: That was that was I think, you know, I said the book was unpleasant, you know, well, not.

683
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:34,639
Speaker 1: but, you know, wasn't really fun.

684
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:47,120
Speaker 1: The part at the end with all the doors and the murder cars and all that, that was probably the most enjoyable part, other than the very, very introductory part where it wasn't the step before you actually read the Steppenwolf's memoirs themselves.

685
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,597
Speaker 0: Each of the doors, I was fat.

686
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:57,278
Speaker 0: I felt like I identified with him one last time where I I desperately wanted to enter several of the doors that he did not enter.

687
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:02,959
Speaker 0: And I was kind of pissed off that he entered murder car, of all things, because there were better doors than murder car.

688
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:10,920
Speaker 1: Well, you could tell that like he was, you know, sort of still resisting, you know, you know, look at the whole metaphor, the the room with the chess pieces.

689
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:19,220
Speaker 0: And he got them out and he kept wanting to use the chess pieces and make worlds and make lives and rearrange everything.

690
00:43:19,785 --> 00:43:21,580
Speaker 0: But he kept getting distracted by all the other doors.

691
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,779
Speaker 0: And then eventually it was too late.

692
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:23,343
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:43:24,692 --> 00:43:25,920
Speaker 0: That was a important part.

694
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:28,439
Speaker 0: Also, the have every girl door.

695
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,120
Speaker 1: I would have just stayed in that one forever.

696
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,399
Speaker 0: But that was that was I think that was one of the most powerful parts of the book.

697
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:42,901
Speaker 1: Just that, you know, as I wondered, I mean, which dude does not have pretty much all that.

698
00:43:43,282 --> 00:43:43,583
Speaker 1: Right.

699
00:43:43,844 --> 00:43:51,079
Speaker 1: It's like there is not a guy, a human, a man on earth who cannot identify with that door and what happens beyond it.

700
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,023
Speaker 1: Not one.

701
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:53,640
Speaker 0: But think about the moral of that door.

702
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,459
Speaker 0: The moral of that is basically Courage Wolf.

703
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,380
Speaker 0: The moral of that door is literally Luke Morgan's ask every girl out.

704
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,519
Speaker 0: Don't be a pussy.

705
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:05,805
Speaker 1: That's true.

706
00:44:05,825 --> 00:44:07,900
Speaker 0: That's kind of the moral of the book.

707
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,884
Speaker 0: I mean, really, if you break it down, I mean, there are a lot of higher morals and there's a complex.

708
00:44:11,904 --> 00:44:18,420
Speaker 1: And I'm sure, you know, according to the dude who is all scholarly, he's like, yeah, nobody really understands this book on their first go.

709
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:19,679
Speaker 1: So we're probably totally wrong.

710
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,479
Speaker 0: It's a complicated book and it says a lot.

711
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,020
Speaker 0: But I think complicated man, the core understands the core moral of the book.

712
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:34,489
Speaker 0: to break it down into a very, very simple and possibly vulgar vernacular is do drugs at least once in your life.

713
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:35,519
Speaker 0: Don't be a pussy.

714
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,485
Speaker 0: Live a little.

715
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,057
Speaker 0: Have an orgy at least once.

716
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:40,385
Speaker 0: I'm not kidding.

717
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:42,820
Speaker 0: Like it's basically a just live your life.

718
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,620
Speaker 0: Listen to the music through the static.

719
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:46,100
Speaker 0: Don't worry about the static.

720
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,352
Speaker 0: Do the best you can.

721
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:47,960
Speaker 0: Don't be a pussy.

722
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:49,360
Speaker 0: Seriously, don't be a pussy.

723
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,005
Speaker 0: Good God.

724
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,419
Speaker 0: Just don't be a pussy.

725
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,539
Speaker 0: Don't strive for things that don't exist.

726
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:57,743
Speaker 1: Dance.

727
00:44:58,276 --> 00:44:58,440
Speaker 1: Yeah.

728
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,200
Speaker 1: Learning to dance is like a large, large portion of the book.

729
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,379
Speaker 0: It was a good metaphor to notice how it culminated in a dance.

730
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:06,042
Speaker 1: Yep.

731
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,859
Speaker 1: Incredibly long and multi-dance.

732
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:10,362
Speaker 0: Yep.

733
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:15,145
Speaker 1: I like that one part of the dance where like, you know, the one girl's like, oh, you're you suck.

734
00:45:15,185 --> 00:45:19,559
Speaker 1: And then later she's like, whoa, you don't suck anymore because he transformed just by getting in.

735
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:24,199
Speaker 0: Well, actually, that's my going into hell because, you know, I'm back.

736
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:26,179
Speaker 1: I'm sure you've had again.

737
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,060
Speaker 0: And I know a lot of people experience this and part of that's why I think people identify with the Steppenwolf.

738
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:45,420
Speaker 0: He's at like the concert when he sees all the people around him, like enraptured by the concert or like he sees that he has this impression of other people, that they are fully engaged by the concert, by the music.

739
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:46,471
Speaker 0: They're dancing.

740
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:47,340
Speaker 0: They're enjoying themselves.

741
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,124
Speaker 0: They're doing whatever.

742
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:52,767
Speaker 0: But he is distracted in his own mind and he can't lose himself in the music.

743
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,520
Speaker 0: He's thinking about all these other things.

744
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:56,480
Speaker 0: And as a result, he feels a part.

745
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:59,500
Speaker 0: All those other people are drawn into this thing.

746
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:00,250
Speaker 0: And I am not.

747
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:01,000
Speaker 0: I'm the Steppenwolf.

748
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:01,563
Speaker 0: I am.

749
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,420
Speaker 0: He's thinking about all these other things.

750
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,000
Speaker 0: He can't be drawn in and he feels like he's missing out and he doesn't know why.

751
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,804
Speaker 0: And it bothers him.

752
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:11,500
Speaker 1: And he just and he starts thinking about it.

753
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:12,630
Speaker 1: Why am I missing out?

754
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:13,780
Speaker 1: And that doesn't help you.

755
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,160
Speaker 1: That's basically just going the opposite direction.

756
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:17,200
Speaker 0: I'm sure you felt that you're at a concert.

757
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:24,200
Speaker 0: But you get the the matter where you start thinking after the concert, what do I do where I should move my arms in the air?

758
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,920
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, a lot of people have problems like that, like they can't go to sleep because they just keep thinking about shit or like lately.

759
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:33,483
Speaker 1: I just been thinking about all this shit I got to do for moving and I can't like do other stuff.

760
00:46:33,664 --> 00:46:37,282
Speaker 0: But look, the the only time in this whole book, well, one of the only times.

761
00:46:37,382 --> 00:46:38,106
Speaker 0: Well, no, the only

762
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,854
Speaker 1: time you're drowning in your thinking

763
00:46:40,216 --> 00:47:01,340
Speaker 0: when he's happy, really, are when he just gives in and actually is able to enjoy what he is doing for what he is doing without worrying about the details of what he is doing and without trying to ascribe whatever he's doing to some higher purpose when he loses himself and making love to Maria, when he loses himself at the ball at the end.

764
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,900
Speaker 0: Those are the only times he loses himself.

765
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:07,100
Speaker 0: And he's not like he becomes stupid or like literally loses his mind.

766
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:10,417
Speaker 0: He just gives in and doesn't.

767
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:11,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

768
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:12,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

769
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:20,520
Speaker 1: Also, I just sort of say, you know, he gets those, you know, there's that theater and it's like not for everyone for Mad Men only.

770
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:21,223
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

771
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,940
Speaker 1: You know, and that's sort of like mysterious kind of shit like that.

772
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,267
Speaker 1: Like, I love that kind of action.

773
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:28,680
Speaker 1: Like what was that Schwarzenegger movie?

774
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,785
Speaker 1: Last Action Hero.

775
00:47:30,427 --> 00:47:33,260
Speaker 1: Ah, where they go like that mysterious movie theater.

776
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,710
Speaker 1: You know, you know all that.

777
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:35,900
Speaker 1: I love that kind of shit.

778
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,007
Speaker 0: I'll say straight up.

779
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,039
Speaker 0: That was a pretty good movie for what it was.

780
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:39,785
Speaker 1: Yeah.

781
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:40,840
Speaker 1: I just I just, you know, whatever.

782
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,199
Speaker 1: There's that sort of like mysterious crap like that.

783
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:44,634
Speaker 1: Like, I like that.

784
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:46,912
Speaker 0: Oh, we didn't even get to talk about it.

785
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:47,940
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into it.

786
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:55,440
Speaker 0: We've already gone on a while, but the whole thing about the bourgeois and just the whole, you know, the comfortable people never accomplish anything.

787
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:02,220
Speaker 0: They're always torn between two worlds, the the very poor and the very rich and the adventure and all the all the ways that you can be forced to live life.

788
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:13,000
Speaker 0: And then like the the middle class of mind, life is the worst one because you can't you're not ever shaken up and you basically live this comfortable, precarious existence forever.

789
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:14,799
Speaker 0: The clean doorstep and all that.

790
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,719
Speaker 0: And there's a lot to say about that, but we've gone on long enough.

791
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:18,203
Speaker 0: Yep.

792
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:19,699
Speaker 1: All righty.

793
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,060
Speaker 0: So what's the next book?

794
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,057
Speaker 1: We can do things of the day.

795
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,785
Speaker 0: There's Scott.

796
00:48:22,826 --> 00:48:23,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

797
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:24,945
Speaker 1: All right.

798
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:26,900
Speaker 1: So no things the day to day.

799
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,658
Speaker 1: This is going to be weird.

800
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:29,326
Speaker 1: The next book.

801
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:34,698
Speaker 1: Well, OK, so the goal of the book club is to get people to fucking read.

802
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:35,020
Speaker 1: Right.

803
00:48:35,301 --> 00:48:36,632
Speaker 0: I suggested The Little Prince.

804
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:37,600
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

805
00:48:37,741 --> 00:48:38,309
Speaker 1: We'll do that next.

806
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:38,978
Speaker 1: Right.

807
00:48:40,581 --> 00:48:44,879
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to think what book is going to get people to read.

808
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,317
Speaker 1: So I'm like, aha, I know what we'll get people to read.

809
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:47,740
Speaker 1: Right.

810
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,237
Speaker 1: You can't come out with like some book they never heard of because then they might not want to read it.

811
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:52,540
Speaker 1: Right.

812
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,879
Speaker 0: You might have to come up with a book that everyone's heard of, but no one's read.

813
00:48:56,381 --> 00:49:00,600
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, it's not a but I didn't come up with one that everyone's heard of, but no one's read.

814
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:05,800
Speaker 1: I came up with one that everyone's heard of, but probably not everyone's read.

815
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:06,661
Speaker 1: Right.

816
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,120
Speaker 1: At least I haven't read it in like a bajillion years.

817
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:14,420
Speaker 1: And once, like, you know, like they hear it and we give them an excuse.

818
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:18,060
Speaker 1: There's like they're going to be like, oh, you can't I got to read it.

819
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,073
Speaker 1: How could I not?

820
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:19,579
Speaker 1: Right.

821
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:21,913
Speaker 1: So the book.

822
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:22,560
Speaker 1: Right.

823
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:29,879
Speaker 1: And I also I wanted to pick one that would be, you know, sort of fun and entertaining and not so heavy and intellectual and brainy.

824
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:37,259
Speaker 1: You know, that way, you know, everyone could sort of get into it and, you know, not like shy away from something that might be all schoolish.

825
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,660
Speaker 1: And also I wanted to get something that be relatively short and easy to read.

826
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,139
Speaker 1: I went, you know, I'm like, what?

827
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,539
Speaker 1: There couldn't possibly be a better book, at least not within like.

828
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:53,586
Speaker 1: after I thought of it like a couple of weeks ago, I could not think of any possible better book club.

829
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,760
Speaker 1: pick for a show called Geek Nights.

830
00:49:56,322 --> 00:49:56,585
Speaker 1: All right.

831
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,379
Speaker 1: And you still have no idea what it is, dude.

832
00:49:59,403 --> 00:50:01,339
Speaker 0: Maybe one of those chocolate war kind of books.

833
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,659
Speaker 1: No, not even close.

834
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,800
Speaker 1: OK, the book we are going to read is you're in the right.

835
00:50:09,044 --> 00:50:09,730
Speaker 1: No, OK.

836
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:10,760
Speaker 1: Not that one either.

837
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:13,840
Speaker 1: It is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

838
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:20,858
Speaker 1: Now, they they have a like a huge mega deluxe editions that have like all the books in it.

839
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:21,240
Speaker 1: Right.

840
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:27,119
Speaker 1: I am only assigning you kiddies the very first original Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book.

841
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:28,071
Speaker 0: All right.

842
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:28,720
Speaker 0: A little hint.

843
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:32,500
Speaker 0: A lot of people probably have not actually read these this book or any of them.

844
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,860
Speaker 0: What I will recommend is that, like Scott said, you're brilliant.

845
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,820
Speaker 0: This is your excuse to read them and never let anyone know your dark secret.

846
00:50:41,102 --> 00:50:41,404
Speaker 1: Right.

847
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:43,300
Speaker 1: I haven't read it since like forever.

848
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,879
Speaker 1: I barely remember half of it.

849
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:49,059
Speaker 0: So I remember listening to radio dramas of it.

850
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:49,602
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:55,699
Speaker 1: I remember there's the radio drama and there's the more recent movie that I never saw, but I saw the trailer radio drama, which is brilliantly.

852
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,505
Speaker 0: voice acted good.

853
00:50:56,526 --> 00:50:56,929
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:50:57,293 --> 00:50:58,020
Speaker 0: Anyway, quick.

855
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:58,552
Speaker 0: They're coming.

856
00:50:58,635 --> 00:50:58,820
Speaker 0: Nobody.

857
00:50:59,261 --> 00:51:02,340
Speaker 1: So everyone go on Amazon buy a link.

858
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:13,740
Speaker 1: I'm going to link to like the the mega deluxe edition that includes like all this stuff and also link to just, you know, the original book by itself with nothing extra added.

859
00:51:14,524 --> 00:51:15,980
Speaker 1: And that's all we're going to talk about.

860
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,720
Speaker 1: We're only going to talk about the very first book.

861
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,327
Speaker 1: We're not going to talk about, you know, like freaking Sammons of Doubt or any shit like that.

862
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:22,649
Speaker 1: Right.

863
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,060
Speaker 1: So keep that to yourself.

864
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:32,480
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
