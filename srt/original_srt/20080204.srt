00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,260
Speaker 0: You don't give a shit.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,498
Speaker 0: You're probably thinking why are they talking about football and all you people from other countries are like, that's not football.

29
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:33,287
Speaker 0: soccer is football Football American.

30
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:33,990
Speaker 0: That's right.

31
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:34,853
Speaker 1: And you know what it is.

32
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:36,359
Speaker 0: and you're saying it's a stupid sport.

33
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:37,346
Speaker 0: rugby He's better than that.

34
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:43,773
Speaker 1: It's a stupid sport, you know I'll say this I used to always think yeah rugby is a real man's sport.

35
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:45,018
Speaker 1: forget football rugby.

36
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:48,080
Speaker 0: rugby is a real Footballs a real man's sport.

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,520
Speaker 1: But once I watched a bunch of rugby and I played some rugby and I learned that playing rugby sucks because it just hurts.

38
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,554
Speaker 0: That's true.

39
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:57,520
Speaker 1: Watching rugby is more like watching a brawl.

40
00:01:58,302 --> 00:01:59,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a real man's sport.

41
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,508
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna dis run.

42
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:04,225
Speaker 0: see the thing is people who are rugby It's sort of like this right?

43
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:07,660
Speaker 0: They some guy was talking about this when it comes to comics fans, too, right?

44
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,342
Speaker 0: Oh, you know what?

45
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:10,951
Speaker 0: I know rugby fans go rugby is awesome.

46
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,640
Speaker 0: football sucks, but football fans like rugby is cool.

47
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:14,913
Speaker 0: But football is also cool.

48
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,988
Speaker 0: It's like People who are anti-underwear.

49
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:18,991
Speaker 0: perfect comic would be like.

50
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:20,356
Speaker 0: comics are cool, but not underwear.

51
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:21,540
Speaker 0: perfect comics, you know.

52
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,989
Speaker 0: But the underwear perfect constant Blake underwear.

53
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:24,973
Speaker 0: perfect comics are cool.

54
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:28,326
Speaker 0: Some of those non-underwear perfect comics It depends on the underwear pervert.

55
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:29,230
Speaker 0: It does it does.

56
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,700
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember though those two guys.

57
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:35,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm here to buy a silvery right nothing else.

58
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:42,200
Speaker 0: But you know, it's it's the the pretentious people are more likely to discount the thing that they feel is lower.

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,800
Speaker 0: Well, you know like the NASCAR fan will respect Formula One, but the Formula One fan will often look down upon the NASCAR.

60
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:51,240
Speaker 1: Ah, but then again, I think there's a lot of NASCAR fans who look down on the Formula.

61
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,144
Speaker 0: I don't think they look down at.

62
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:53,853
Speaker 0: they'd probably just don't care about or know about it.

63
00:02:53,913 --> 00:03:03,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think a good analogy Well a straight-up analogy is snowboarders and skiers - because yeah, look at snowboarders like yeah, you're nothing And that's the correct opinion.

64
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:05,213
Speaker 0: But snowboarders like skiers, whatever.

65
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:05,916
Speaker 0: Yeah.

66
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:06,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

67
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:07,080
Speaker 0: All right.

68
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:15,848
Speaker 0: But yeah, I know it's probably not important to most people but when you know it Sports fandom is like inherited.

69
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,974
Speaker 1: Well, it's not just that.

70
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:19,960
Speaker 1: I mean Scott is he's got sports in the blood.

71
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,348
Speaker 1: I mean his dad and his parents visit.

72
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,652
Speaker 0: you have people you have a family.

73
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:26,040
Speaker 0: they came from Eastern Europe to New York.

74
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:31,940
Speaker 0: Your grandfather was a fan of the New York Giants and your father was a fan of the New York Giants.

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,684
Speaker 0: I don't know how I know.

76
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:35,780
Speaker 0: a lot of other people pick their sports teams in other ways.

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,859
Speaker 0: You know, they some like a lot of people my age or Chicago Bulls fans because the Bulls were you know Very good when they were kids, you know, and I was almost a Bulls fan, too.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,857
Speaker 0: Yeah A lot of people are Cowboys fans because the Cowboys were very good when we were kids and they're front runners and they were kids And they stuck with that team, you know

79
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 1: People who they look at who's winning or who's good and they're fans of the good team.

80
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,458
Speaker 0: You know, maybe they you know, some people like I know some people who like the Pittsburgh Penguins just because they like penguins.

81
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,120
Speaker 0: No, they like the logo or there's something or they pick the team that happens to be near where they live.

82
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,000
Speaker 0: You know, they they move to Indianapolis and now they're Colts fans, you know, it's how it happens.

83
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,600
Speaker 0: But when your fit your entire family is like together on something you pass along the fandom to your children.

84
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:24,433
Speaker 0: It has another meaning beyond a guy throwing a piece of rubber tradition tradition.

85
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:35,399
Speaker 1: But you know it's because I think my my family on my dad's side pretty much like my great-grandparents came from Belgium moved to Detroit and We've been hockey fans.

86
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:42,215
Speaker 1: my family's been hockey fans as long as they've been in this country and You know my parents had Rangers season tickets in the 70s before.

87
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:43,180
Speaker 0: they were zillion dollars.

88
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:49,700
Speaker 1: A lot of my relatives saw Red Wings games in the Coliseum the most dangerous fucking arena in the world.

89
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:56,700
Speaker 1: Yeah But just you know, we've said this before but I know we have a lot of new listeners.

90
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:01,486
Speaker 1: So you might be if you're thinking hey geek nights You're not real geeks talking about sports.

91
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:05,859
Speaker 1: now that talking about sports does not make you not a geek makes you not a nerd.

92
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,485
Speaker 1: There's a big difference.

93
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:09,411
Speaker 0: because I mean think about all those guys.

94
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:12,000
Speaker 0: turn on your local sports radio station, right?

95
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:15,673
Speaker 0: You're gonna hear especially in New York or in Boston, right?

96
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,643
Speaker 1: Oh, well, Joey Jojo was 24/7 Last year.

97
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:19,806
Speaker 0: they have these TV shows.

98
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:25,487
Speaker 0: They had these radio shows where they got guys, you know sports guys call in and they're like Oh, what do you think about this?

99
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:26,452
Speaker 0: What do you think about that?

100
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,135
Speaker 0: I think this.

101
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:27,859
Speaker 0: I think that right?

102
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,845
Speaker 0: These people are sports geeks.

103
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:34,100
Speaker 0: Just like you're you're a computer geek or science geek or an anime geek.

104
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:38,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, there are sports nerds to watch out for sports nerds.

105
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:43,798
Speaker 1: Sports nerds are possibly the guys who are not drunk but yet still body-painted.

106
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,292
Speaker 1: Yes The not drunk I think is key there.

107
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:49,279
Speaker 0: you watch out for them.

108
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:50,704
Speaker 0: Yeah.

109
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:51,247
Speaker 0: Yeah.

110
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:51,690
Speaker 1: All right.

111
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:52,898
Speaker 0: So it's that's good.

112
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:57,073
Speaker 1: We might talk about the the sporting event in a little bit more detail.

113
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,360
Speaker 1: But before we get in the future probably maybe Thursday.

114
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:03,372
Speaker 1: Yeah, now we were like, oh next Thursday, but we're going to katsu khan.

117
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 1: We're not gonna have time to talk to you.

118
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,019
Speaker 1: We're gonna be setting up stuff on like the stages and and then we're gonna lock yourself We hanging out in the in the game cats.

119
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:27,189
Speaker 1: Mostly what we're gonna do is we're gonna stand there while everyone else wheels in all the arcade cabinets And then we're going to test the rampart machine all night.

120
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:28,233
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

121
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,020
Speaker 0: Yes, it needs adequate testing.

122
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:34,451
Speaker 0: How do we know the track balls are fully functional?

123
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:37,542
Speaker 0: you got it what the tournament wouldn't be fair if we didn't thoroughly check to Make sure.

124
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 1: but tomorrow is actually an important day.

125
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,210
Speaker 1: See, it's nice because Scott and I take a tape parade.

126
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:45,680
Speaker 1: both have reasons to be excited about tomorrow.

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,625
Speaker 1: I mean for Scott though.

128
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:47,570
Speaker 1: I also am excited.

129
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:54,180
Speaker 1: There's going to be a ticker tape parade One of those old I think as Scott said key to the city type actions.

130
00:06:54,361 --> 00:07:00,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically they go from Battery Park Which if you don't know is the bottom of the city where you can see the Statue of Liberty.

131
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:06,180
Speaker 0: and they go north You know down Broadway past where the old Trade Center used to be well up Broadway up Broadway.

132
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I always say down whenever I say I walk down the street, you know, even if it's north I always say walking down.

133
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually say walk up the street, but I get messed up if I'm going east or west I don't always use down.

134
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:25,090
Speaker 0: But even though I know I should I don't say I later allies across the way and there is a portion of that street That is known as the Canyon of Heroes We just aptly named.

135
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,460
Speaker 0: that's why they had the praise there, right?

136
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,821
Speaker 0: It's all.

137
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:39,600
Speaker 0: you should always also go there because it's there's a reason they called the Canyon of Heroes And they go through the Canyon of Heroes and then they go to the city hall Where they have a little key to the city type thing and then they're going back to Jersey where the stadium is.

138
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,505
Speaker 0: we need Stadium Jersey.

139
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,080
Speaker 1: if only we could have because there's no more real estate.

140
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:55,120
Speaker 1: But at the same time if there were extra-dimensional spaces Where what better place to have the sports arena than just connected to Grand Central or something?

141
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:59,840
Speaker 1: If only we could have some sort of floating stadium just right above Manhattan.

142
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,519
Speaker 0: No, I think you just put it out in Queens next to Shea Stadium.

143
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:06,118
Speaker 1: Well, are we just make a barge right off of Manhattan and we wheel it in?

144
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,299
Speaker 1: every time There's a some sort of big sporting event.

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not gonna work.

146
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,534
Speaker 0: it would sink when 80,000 people got on it.

147
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:17,960
Speaker 1: No, you just have some ballast.

148
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:19,104
Speaker 1: Well, maybe not ballast.

149
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,671
Speaker 1: you need some some lifts.

150
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:22,117
Speaker 1: Yeah have it floating.

151
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:22,800
Speaker 1: It's a dirigible.

152
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,960
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this parade, you know, New York City it I'm probably gonna go to the parade.

153
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,626
Speaker 1: I have work to do unlike people.

154
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:35,440
Speaker 0: I know I have work to do but I might go with some co-workers at the parade.

155
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:38,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only reason I won't is that I'm way uptown and to go.

156
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:41,865
Speaker 1: compared to where the parade's gonna be Yeah, taking it.

157
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:45,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but and taking the subway I think to the parade is not gonna be a fun experience.

158
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:45,866
Speaker 0: Maybe fun.

159
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:47,840
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think I'd really get out of subway.

160
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,612
Speaker 1: I I've worries about all the people are gonna be trying to get down.

161
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:53,111
Speaker 0: take the six train to Brooklyn Bridge I'll get out.

162
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:53,498
Speaker 0: I'll walk.

163
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,249
Speaker 1: But tomorrow there was also something else going on.

164
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,986
Speaker 0: It is Super Tuesday the pretty much Why they call it Super Tuesday?

165
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,098
Speaker 1: because the Giants won the Super Bowl.

166
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:05,500
Speaker 1: That's right.

167
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,347
Speaker 1: Yes, that is in fact the etymology of the word word.

168
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:13,120
Speaker 1: You see when the Giants won the Super Bowl yesterday the term Super Tuesday.

169
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,512
Speaker 0: No, I think it just has to do with the Super Bowl in general.

170
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,664
Speaker 1: no, it has nothing to do with that It does.

171
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,897
Speaker 0: it's a Tuesday at the Super Bowl.

172
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:24,720
Speaker 1: But you realize that now there have been other Super Tuesday anyway.

173
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,920
Speaker 1: Basically every primary in this country that matters is happening tomorrow.

174
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:33,151
Speaker 1: And pretty much if you're a Republican, it doesn't matter.

175
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,540
Speaker 1: don't even bother voting because it doesn't matter.

176
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,390
Speaker 1: There's no way to tell but with the Democrats.

177
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,160
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say who to vote for.

178
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:40,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am gonna say who to vote for.

179
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:44,156
Speaker 1: I hereby officially endorsed Barack Obama for president of the United States.

180
00:09:44,537 --> 00:09:47,246
Speaker 0: I hereby endorse My mom.

181
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:48,777
Speaker 0: my mom would be better than these candidates.

182
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,099
Speaker 0: You know what?

183
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,617
Speaker 1: I will also endorse your mom but secondarily to your mother and to my mother.

184
00:09:53,637 --> 00:10:03,190
Speaker 1: your mom So tertiary Lee nice mom for president Anyone but Scott Johnson's mom.

185
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,214
Speaker 1: actually, you know what I think.

186
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,325
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson's mom We better than any can.

187
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:09,120
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson's mom polls pretty well clean up this country.

188
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:18,019
Speaker 1: If I know other thing the name recognition I mean who is brought up more in conversation among the front row crew than Scott Johnson's mom your mom.

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,540
Speaker 1: Anyway if you are registered as a Democrat or if you're in a state where you can vote in any primary or caucus or what?

190
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,756
Speaker 1: Have you if you care the caucus stay home?

191
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:31,440
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

192
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:32,640
Speaker 1: No caucuses are awesome.

193
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:35,394
Speaker 0: You don't if you don't have all day you really don't know.

194
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,500
Speaker 1: most caucuses are at night.

195
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,196
Speaker 1: But I can say this if you have never been to a caucus caucuses are awesome.

196
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:45,678
Speaker 1: They're super fun Especially if you have nothing better to do.

197
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,767
Speaker 0: no Especially what I'm afraid to go to.

198
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:55,494
Speaker 1: if you were there to cause trouble if you were there to be Yelling about Mike Revell the whole time then a caucus is where you run Paul people.

199
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,119
Speaker 0: Don't go to the caucus to stay home.

200
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:07,300
Speaker 1: But Seriously the the deal with this election is pretty much if young people turn out then Barack Obama's probably going to win the nomination.

201
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:10,772
Speaker 1: If young people don't turn out then Hillary Clinton is probably going to win.

202
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,920
Speaker 0: young people go to the caucuses old people stay home.

203
00:11:13,302 --> 00:11:15,900
Speaker 1: I really I mean, I really want Barack to win.

204
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:27,020
Speaker 1: But at the same time if the worst thing that can happen is Hillary Clinton is president I think the country is doing pretty well and all there's a lot of haters But I think a lot of you are unreasonable.

205
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:29,127
Speaker 0: I'd rather have Mike Revell.

206
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:34,104
Speaker 0: Mike Revell is actually pretty weird Mike Revell because I agree with him on 99% of everything.

207
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:38,540
Speaker 0: but then he says blah blah blah crazy fair tax and I'm like what the fuck is wrong with you.

208
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,240
Speaker 1: I feel like if I could just sit down with him for five minutes and be like, here's why fair tax is stupid.

209
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:46,675
Speaker 0: Why doesn't he just sit down like Alan Greenspan for five minutes to be like?

210
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:47,780
Speaker 0: it changes mind.

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,119
Speaker 0: So fair taxes, you know what I'd vote for her.

212
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:58,997
Speaker 1: I really don't get how the internet is backing Ron Paul But early on Mike Revell and Ron Paul were kind of this equal level of like internet and nowhere else.

213
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,040
Speaker 1: Are they known or popular?

214
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,020
Speaker 1: Why is the internet which is nominally pretty well informed for Ron Paul?

215
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:16,720
Speaker 1: Who is 90% crazy and 10% smart as opposed to Mike Revell who is 90% smart and 10% crazy Because the Internet's 90% crazy conspiracy theories.

216
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:27,800
Speaker 1: Anyway I'll put it this way if you want Barack Obama to get the nomination Go out and vote in the primary because pretty much no one under the age of 30 votes in primaries.

217
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:31,580
Speaker 1: So, uh, if you go and vote that's actually a really big deal.

218
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,469
Speaker 1: So that is that is my political message of the day.

219
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,898
Speaker 0: Your real vote isn't gonna matter later.

220
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:38,142
Speaker 1: Trust me No, it's not.

221
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:38,663
Speaker 1: because.

222
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:46,791
Speaker 0: so your only chance you have of making any difference whatsoever because nothing else you do will make a difference Is to vote tomorrow, that's all you've got.

223
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:52,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, because unless I can't vote tomorrow though I'm an independent and it doesn't matter cuz it's New York and I have no choice.

224
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,538
Speaker 0: Anyway, my vote can't matter no matter what well mine can which is why I'll go to the parade instead.

225
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,080
Speaker 1: my vote.

226
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:01,164
Speaker 1: You see the thing is and I'll go For two hours.

227
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:09,028
Speaker 1: I actually changed my party membership from independent to Democrat just for this and you know What gasps the day after tomorrow?

228
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:13,040
Speaker 1: I'm switching it either to independent or to Golisano's party independence party.

229
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,738
Speaker 1: Yeah independent or independence.

230
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:18,146
Speaker 1: Things I like.

231
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:19,694
Speaker 0: yeah, it's sort of like that trick.

232
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:22,942
Speaker 1: No one special Nobody's special, you know It's too bad.

233
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,773
Speaker 1: all the other parties with good names are always evil.

234
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:27,882
Speaker 1: every time anytime you see a political party That's a name.

235
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,768
Speaker 0: institution party is our worst party.

236
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:34,684
Speaker 1: or like the freedom or anytime a party has a good word in the name It is probably something bad.

237
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:37,373
Speaker 0: I know it's like in theory the Constitution Party.

238
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,700
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh man, they want to restore the Constitution.

239
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:40,283
Speaker 0: All right.

240
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,400
Speaker 0: No go look at what the Constitution Party believes.

241
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,393
Speaker 0: They're all complete nutjobs like the nuttiest religious nutjobs you'll ever come up with.

242
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,438
Speaker 0: but they call themselves the Constitution Party.

243
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:51,674
Speaker 0: great way to be honest.

244
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:59,225
Speaker 1: Anyway in a news that you probably actually expect us to talk about We'll just do in one news today.

245
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:12,419
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is this is actually a pretty big important news in terms of Regardless of what happens the landscape of Internet has possibly changed forever, which is something that happens more and more often.

246
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,683
Speaker 1: but Yeah, who right?

247
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:18,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was one of those like big names like they've been.

248
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:20,300
Speaker 1: they're one of those huge internet companies.

249
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:21,144
Speaker 1: They do a lot.

250
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:22,872
Speaker 1: They're kind of like these stalwart.

251
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:27,689
Speaker 1: Well, uh Microsoft just said hey, we want to buy.

252
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:30,678
Speaker 1: you will offer you this ludicrous amount of money.

253
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:31,460
Speaker 1: Give us your company.

254
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:37,375
Speaker 0: It's actually a little more complicated than that but that we're not gonna go into the details like it's not.

255
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:40,759
Speaker 0: it didn't happen yet It'll take a long time.

256
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,236
Speaker 0: How exactly something what it could it might not even happen.

257
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:45,140
Speaker 1: and things like this.

258
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,533
Speaker 1: I mean companies make offers like that on a like.

259
00:14:48,553 --> 00:15:06,420
Speaker 1: they make offers a lot like that on regular basis but the fact that this one is credible and Serious and the fact that Yahoo couldn't immediately say no and it's it's not a hostile takeover like that Monty Python thing But it's closer to a possible hostile takeover than you might otherwise expect.

260
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,560
Speaker 0: I mean imagine if you had a company right that was worth five hundred dollars.

261
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,250
Speaker 0: We're just you know, theoretically right and you had.

262
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,979
Speaker 0: you're on the stock market or a publicly traded company, right?

263
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,140
Speaker 0: Well, if your company is worth five hundred dollars someone with five hundred dollars could buy your company.

264
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:29,060
Speaker 0: They could go to the stock market and if everyone who had shares is willing to sell them They could buy your entire company and there's nothing you the founder of the company could do about it.

265
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,525
Speaker 0: You're a publicly traded company, right?

266
00:15:31,026 --> 00:15:33,996
Speaker 0: Unless you had 51% of the shares and refused to sell them.

267
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:42,374
Speaker 0: now Basically they did is they went to Yahoo and they said we would like to buy you and Yahoo was like All right.

268
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,185
Speaker 0: How much money?

269
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:44,939
Speaker 0: and the amount of money they said?

270
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,475
Speaker 0: Was enough money where if they wanted to they could have done a hostile takeover on the stock market, but they didn't.

271
00:15:52,157 --> 00:16:02,566
Speaker 1: now beyond that Yahoo No one knows if this is related or not, it's probably unrelated because no one used this anyway, but Yahoo's music service is done.

272
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,951
Speaker 1: They're basically shutting it down.

273
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, who should done a lot of it seems like Yahoo.

274
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:08,564
Speaker 0: They their search.

275
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:13,580
Speaker 0: it still exists because that was the first thing they ever did but it's not really used that much anymore.

276
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:17,974
Speaker 0: Their maps are okay, but Google Maps seems to have mostly beaten them right.

277
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 0: their mail is wicked popular.

278
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,252
Speaker 0: I think it's the most popular webmail.

279
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:24,426
Speaker 0: you compare it, you know As good as Gmail is.

280
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:28,638
Speaker 0: it's scary that hotmail and Yahoo mail is still way more popular than Gmail.

281
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,929
Speaker 0: way Lots, right.

282
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:33,683
Speaker 1: Well, I think a lot of that cuz Like.

283
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,995
Speaker 1: it's weird, but adults don't get it even at my work.

284
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:39,627
Speaker 1: We're like everyone's like crazy Technological and everyone.

285
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,340
Speaker 1: so few people use Gmail.

286
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,720
Speaker 1: They all use like the account that Comcast gave them or like whatever email account they got last and no one switches.

287
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:50,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's.

288
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:52,520
Speaker 0: it's very hard for people to switch out of email.

289
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:03,010
Speaker 0: It's also hard for people to switch out of instant messaging and MSN and Yahoo are Combined would be the basically the instant messaging Kings and I mean as we can use Google Talk and aim.

290
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,299
Speaker 0: but and aim I think is the single biggest.

291
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,926
Speaker 0: but MSN and Yahoo together would be bigger.

292
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:22,444
Speaker 0: and then you look Yahoo has sort of like these content you know, like they have Yahoo News and Yahoo Finance things like that and They have Yahoo's advertising thing which is kind of meager compared to Microsoft or Google but it's not insignificant.

293
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:31,414
Speaker 0: and then the rest of the stuff that Yahoo has that you care about right is the things they bought like flicker and Delicious and such like that.

294
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:37,720
Speaker 0: and yeah It's been really good about buying that stuff like flicker and delicious and then not fucking it up like they buy it.

295
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,387
Speaker 0: They let it go and that's it.

296
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:41,174
Speaker 0: But flicker doesn't make money.

297
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:42,198
Speaker 0: flicker hemorrhages money.

298
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,875
Speaker 0: Delicious doesn't really make money either.

299
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,445
Speaker 0: It's not a Bookmarking.

300
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,571
Speaker 0: There's not much money in that.

301
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:53,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time What does Yahoo really have to offer anymore?

302
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:58,160
Speaker 1: Like seriously from it not from a business standpoint, but from us as technological people.

303
00:17:58,682 --> 00:17:59,466
Speaker 0: Delicious and flicker.

304
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:04,123
Speaker 1: Yeah things that Yahoo didn't make they just bought right The reason.

305
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:12,160
Speaker 0: you know Microsoft probably buying them up so they can combine their advertising thing You know their web advertising with the I'll advertising to take on Google, you know.

306
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,185
Speaker 0: It's like Microsoft exists, right.

307
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:20,020
Speaker 0: and then you know, because it's like Google isn't even competing with Microsoft directly.

308
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,084
Speaker 0: You know, they're a search engine.

309
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:25,080
Speaker 0: Microsoft makes Windows and Office, you know, these are not competing companies, right?

310
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,006
Speaker 1: Well, Microsoft has a search right?

311
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:39,372
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I mean, you know, but Microsoft for some reason sort of like Turned its whole company away from Windows and Office and all that shit Right in order to fight with Google a non-competing company.

312
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:40,716
Speaker 0: and sure Google has.

313
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:47,495
Speaker 0: you know things that do sort of fight Around with Microsoft like they've got the Gmail the Google Docs and and these sorts of things, right?

314
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:50,322
Speaker 0: But you know Google.

315
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,693
Speaker 0: none of those things really are that successful.

316
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:54,320
Speaker 0: They're not that you know widespread.

317
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:56,086
Speaker 0: No one really uses a lot of those things.

318
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:57,451
Speaker 0: Google only.

319
00:18:57,531 --> 00:19:07,029
Speaker 0: really their search and their ads are Successful and now their mobile stuff is starting to be successful and the Gmail only a little bit and all the other stuff is kind of right.

320
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:12,539
Speaker 0: so Microsoft is like rearing up to compete with these people that weren't fighting with them.

321
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,045
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it.

322
00:19:14,065 --> 00:19:17,660
Speaker 0: It's like turning this giant ship around to shoot at someone who wasn't shooting at you.

323
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,139
Speaker 1: Well, I think what Microsoft realized is that they have this big old clunking ship, right and they're going along and nothing can touch them.

324
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:32,380
Speaker 1: But then they started to notice that there's all these coves They can't get into with their big ship and in those coves was treasure and they saw Google whipping into all these coves.

325
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:36,080
Speaker 0: And then they realized that Google only got treasure from like two coves.

326
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:37,424
Speaker 1: That was it.

327
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,832
Speaker 1: well the thing is there's more coves in the future.

328
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:44,431
Speaker 0: theoretically, I mean granted I Google analogy is breaking down.

329
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,220
Speaker 1: Well, that's going down with the ship.

330
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:49,260
Speaker 1: The real problem here is that there are two sides to this.

331
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,174
Speaker 1: there's the make of money from a business side and the provide useful technology side.

332
00:19:54,274 --> 00:20:08,152
Speaker 1: and if I look at it from a From a personal perspective as in me as a technologist as a technology professional as a human being as a user of the Internet Google provides Almost everything I need to use my computer.

333
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:12,045
Speaker 1: between Google and Linus Torvalds I have the internet.

334
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:15,035
Speaker 0: all I worry about with this news here, right?

335
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:16,460
Speaker 0: Really won't hurt me at all.

336
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,820
Speaker 0: The only thing I worry about is the state of delicious in the state of flicker.

337
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,560
Speaker 0: I mean if flicker gets fucked up by Microsoft theoretically, which wouldn't even if it happened.

338
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,979
Speaker 0: It wouldn't happen for a year more than a year from now, right?

339
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:30,029
Speaker 0: I would just move to Google's Picasa and I'd be fine.

340
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,099
Speaker 0: You know, it's not as nice as flicker, but whatever it works, right?

341
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:36,854
Speaker 0: If delicious is screwed, I don't know what the fuck I would do.

342
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:39,567
Speaker 1: we'd have to make a competitor I don't know just for us.

343
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:41,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, they they better not fuck up delicious.

344
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:42,280
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

345
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:45,012
Speaker 1: No, if they screw it up, we'll just make our own for us.

346
00:20:45,173 --> 00:20:49,128
Speaker 1: And if anyone else wants to use it great We'll become a web 2.5 billionaires.

347
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,820
Speaker 1: And if no one else uses it, well, we have our own personal delicious.

348
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,823
Speaker 1: That's all I care about.

349
00:20:53,843 --> 00:20:58,118
Speaker 1: We'll call it geek issues geek nights dot something.

350
00:20:58,539 --> 00:20:58,820
Speaker 0: I just.

351
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:02,391
Speaker 0: It's a Google needs a delicious competitor of some kind.

352
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:04,258
Speaker 0: I don't care if they put their Google ads on it.

353
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:07,691
Speaker 1: You know, I pretty much block Google ads.

354
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:08,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

355
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:09,680
Speaker 0: But that's why I said it.

356
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,118
Speaker 0: I don't care if they put the ads on it cuz I won't see it.

357
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:18,038
Speaker 1: But the thing is I mean Google provides most of the stuff I need and Yahoo indirectly provides a few other things, but they're not things I need.

358
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:21,026
Speaker 1: but From a business standpoint Google.

359
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:28,809
Speaker 1: It's I don't know how they're gonna make money in the long run because advertising is is Slowly but surely I think becoming something dead.

360
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,234
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

361
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:34,171
Speaker 1: and there's also the problem of alright We've got Microsoft Yahoo and Google.

362
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,105
Speaker 1: Oh wait now we've got Micro who?

363
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:40,136
Speaker 1: and Google great yah soft.

364
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:43,409
Speaker 1: Yeah That sounds vaguely sinister.

365
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,340
Speaker 1: Yeah now I've also heard rumblings now.

366
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,983
Speaker 1: This is from.

367
00:21:46,003 --> 00:22:03,440
Speaker 1: it was on Reuters, but it was on Reuters quoting an as-yet-unnamed anonymous source saying that Yahoo has tentatively responded by approaching Google about the two of them partnering up and Doubling their advertising together instead of letting Microsoft in on the action.

368
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:08,740
Speaker 0: Well, I mean Microsoft, you know It's sort of decided that it wants to be in that business that it never was in.

369
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:17,548
Speaker 0: So if Google and Yahoo team up with that I don't think anyone the SEC would allow that or the FTC or whoever it is Right, because that's just monopoly the end.

370
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:19,014
Speaker 0: You can't they can't let that happen, right?

371
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,740
Speaker 0: They let the double-click business happen.

372
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,680
Speaker 0: They can't let Yahoo Google, but if they did Microsoft would be basically like, okay, we have to go back to Windows Office.

373
00:22:26,822 --> 00:22:28,059
Speaker 0: We can't compete in that area.

374
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:32,616
Speaker 1: See at the same time if Google bought Yahoo, that would be like a nerd's wet dream.

375
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,584
Speaker 1: ignore the business side But just for a nerd.

376
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:37,416
Speaker 1: now Google's gonna be in control of flicker and all that business.

377
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:42,296
Speaker 0: Everything's gonna be great But Google delicious and then flicker and picasa hooking up together.

378
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:43,180
Speaker 0: good times.

379
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,216
Speaker 1: I just I don't know what the future of any of these companies is gonna be.

380
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:50,959
Speaker 1: to be perfectly honest I feel like the internet is Changing so quickly that good.

381
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,203
Speaker 1: The only thing Google has is the fact that they're massive and they have a lot of power and money to back up their technology To make it work.

382
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:57,885
Speaker 1: things.

383
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:05,618
Speaker 1: that I mean we Scott and I could make something like Google Google apps just fine But we could never afford to put together the infrastructure to support it.

384
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:09,659
Speaker 1: Yep That's all Google has to offer really is the fact that they already have money.

385
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:13,740
Speaker 1: All Microsoft has to offer is that they already have money and they have installed base.

386
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:18,840
Speaker 1: All Yahoo has to offer is that they had money so they bought a bunch of stuff that was useful to people.

387
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:22,720
Speaker 0: And Yahoo does have a lot of stuff that is used by a lot of people.

388
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not stuff that we really care about.

389
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:27,580
Speaker 1: I think most of that is just a Yahoo Games is not bad?

390
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:28,324
Speaker 1: No, it isn't.

391
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,877
Speaker 1: but I think a lot of what Yahoo has is just name recognition.

392
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:31,299
Speaker 1: people who?

393
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,840
Speaker 1: Were in there the poor were adults in the 90s think back and oh, yeah Yahoo Yeah, it was just like one of those names one of those internet things.

394
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,215
Speaker 1: So when they think I got to do something they either think Google or they think Yahoo.

395
00:23:42,737 --> 00:23:47,775
Speaker 1: Yep Wow, I guess we didn't have much to say because we're not business analysts.

396
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:48,800
Speaker 1: We don't know what's gonna happen.

397
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:49,796
Speaker 0: No, you don't know shit.

398
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:01,930
Speaker 1: football Things of the day the bears know.

399
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:04,849
Speaker 0: There's law laws last year.

400
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,937
Speaker 1: I'd like to yell hockey but it's really not appropriate.

401
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:11,544
Speaker 1: what would have been one of those inappropriate yellings.

402
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:15,537
Speaker 0: Hockey is the awesome and Hockey's actually better than football.

403
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:17,870
Speaker 0: Yes, you know, but the Rangers are not so good.

404
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:20,792
Speaker 1: The specific RIT hockey Yeah The one.

405
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:28,606
Speaker 0: the one great thing about the Super Bowl is when the Super Bowl is over The only sports left are hockey and basketball.

406
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:29,650
Speaker 0: who gives a shit about basketball?

407
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:36,350
Speaker 0: So it's pretty much just hockey now hockey only until baseball season starts and the Red Wings is doing pretty well.

408
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:45,399
Speaker 0: Okay, you're doing pretty well, but that Oh vegkin the guys just oh my god Here we go.

409
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:46,668
Speaker 0: easy thing of the day.

410
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:59,448
Speaker 0: Unlike some other professional sports baseball The NFL is not so stupid when it comes to the Internet's, you know They might take your videos off of YouTube or they might not.

411
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:02,970
Speaker 1: you know They won't let you show your football game in a big screen at the church.

412
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,655
Speaker 0: But no, they won't.

413
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:16,270
Speaker 0: but at NFL comm slash videos where they have a few tasteful ads that you can ignore They give you all the highlights of pretty much every freaking game and all the coverage and all the all this stuff.

414
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,930
Speaker 0: You can just watch it right there on the website for free NFL comm slash videos.

415
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:20,777
Speaker 0: It's real simple.

416
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:27,670
Speaker 1: now if you didn't watch the Super Bowl Even if you don't really like sports I'd recommend you watch some of these highlights because some crazy things happen near the end of this game.

417
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,295
Speaker 0: Right, even if you don't care about football, even if you don't even care about you know Less about the team is playing.

418
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:36,589
Speaker 0: if you care if you in fact hate football watch this.

419
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:46,962
Speaker 0: Anyway, because you watch and just watch like the highlights reels like the Giants defensive highlights reel or like the Eli Miracle play that's the best play.

420
00:25:47,002 --> 00:25:49,452
Speaker 0: the whole game right there Watch.

421
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:51,478
Speaker 1: I watch that at work like three times.

422
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:52,461
Speaker 0: just watch.

423
00:25:52,862 --> 00:26:02,410
Speaker 0: and even if you don't know what's going on Or even though a lot of the drama of the play is knowing the exact situation and why that basically won in the game.

424
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:06,845
Speaker 0: But just watch what the people do in the play.

425
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,450
Speaker 0: It's it's feats of strength.

426
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:15,496
Speaker 0: It's like, you know You go to the circus and you watch the trapeze guy and he does something amazing and you think wow Think about what he had to do to do that.

427
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:18,206
Speaker 0: That's an amazing human being can accomplish.

428
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:19,390
Speaker 0: That is amazing.

429
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:31,290
Speaker 0: And then you watch, you know Sasuke or you know aka ninja warrior and you watch these guys doing the obstacle course and you say wow Look a human being accomplished that amazing feat, you know a guy ran the mile in four minutes.

430
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:34,238
Speaker 0: You know Muhammad Ali beat the shit out of that guy.

431
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:35,783
Speaker 1: and then you watch.

432
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:37,930
Speaker 1: what was that quote that we just recently heard from?

433
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:51,430
Speaker 0: There was a Mike Tyson quote that was very applicable to this Super Bowl and that's Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face Right or something along those lines.

434
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,393
Speaker 0: I might have paraphrased it.

435
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:57,510
Speaker 0: but watch like these highlight reels and see what the people do in the game.

436
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,947
Speaker 0: But then you maybe if you hate football or you just don't care you'll understand why people like it so much.

437
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:12,727
Speaker 0: in a small way Because you watch a game and you know while a lot of the game might not be as exciting as all that you watch and you see someone execute an amazing feat.

438
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:17,085
Speaker 0: that is Just unbelievable that a human can accomplish that.

439
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:28,182
Speaker 0: and yet Against when a whole bunch of guys, you know, 11 12 other guys are trying to stop them from doing it They managed to do it anyway, and it's like holy shit.

440
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:29,325
Speaker 0: Look at what that guy just did.

441
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:30,429
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

442
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:37,070
Speaker 1: So speaking of football it has been argued that the aa-12 is the world's deadliest shotgun by the internet.

443
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:41,584
Speaker 0: I don't know much about what I don't you know, I know about weapons.

444
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:49,930
Speaker 0: when I know from counter-strike I was about to say my knowledge is extended by counter-strike and a little out of strike movies and a few YouTube.

445
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,094
Speaker 1: It depends on the movies.

446
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:55,349
Speaker 1: I mean Rambo taught me that machine guns never run out of ammo and never miss.

447
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:56,775
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know, you learn.

448
00:27:56,815 --> 00:28:02,962
Speaker 0: you'll learn some stuff from you, you know, but I do not have a Military fanboy level of weapons knowledge.

449
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,450
Speaker 0: So enlighten me now.

450
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,727
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is this video my thing of the day is not specifically the weapon though.

451
00:28:08,748 --> 00:28:28,412
Speaker 1: I want to say the this video in this weapon basically just show the thing that all science including military science is always improving and this is a pretty Crazy shotgun, especially when they get to the part about 3/4 the way through the video Where they point out that this shotgun doesn't just shoot shotgun shells, but also Grenades,

452
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:31,870
Speaker 0: yeah anything that you can put in a shotgun shell it can shoot.

453
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,608
Speaker 0: So if they make a grenade that goes in a shotgun shell you can shoot it.

454
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:38,681
Speaker 1: So when the zombies come tracked is gone down.

455
00:28:38,721 --> 00:28:40,589
Speaker 1: This is like the best anti-zombie gun ever.

456
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:46,840
Speaker 0: P90 and possibly the Would not be good against zombies.

457
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,050
Speaker 1: Yes, it would single single tap, right?

458
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,670
Speaker 1: Just pop pop pop shot to the head as long as you can aim.

459
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:54,441
Speaker 0: Yeah, you gotta aim but this thing you don't to aim for shit.

460
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:56,450
Speaker 0: No, it's very easy to aim.

461
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:58,270
Speaker 0: This would be the best zombie weapon.

462
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,110
Speaker 0: The only thing I worry is that if you shoot the shells too quickly That you will in fact have to keep reloading and it doesn't look like you can reload that quick.

463
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:06,850
Speaker 1: No, you can't reload this thing quickly.

464
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:11,315
Speaker 0: I mean, well, I guess if you had a separate like, you know Cuz it looks like a tommy gun.

465
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:13,543
Speaker 0: where has you know, like the round of shells, right?

466
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:15,270
Speaker 1: You call the drum the drum.

467
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:15,954
Speaker 0: Yes, thank you.

468
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:16,317
Speaker 0: See shit.

469
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,223
Speaker 0: See how much you know about guns.

470
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:21,370
Speaker 0: You could probably Tiny bit more because I'd say I have a gun.

471
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:28,310
Speaker 0: Oh, no, if you had separate loaded drums, you could price switch the drums out and keep going But if you had to refill a drum that would take a while.

472
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,810
Speaker 1: I think this thing though has like no recalls like this crazy cool weapon.

473
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:40,027
Speaker 1: But my thing of the day is not so much that the weapon exists or the video But it's the the person in the video because you see guy the bald guy.

474
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:40,890
Speaker 0: He's a scary dude.

475
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:48,976
Speaker 1: This is some Discovery Channel, you know those documentaries on like the History Channel or the Discovery Channel that are basically Check this thing out.

476
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:54,270
Speaker 1: We're gonna show you a video and then talk about how cool it is But you're not gonna actually learn anything useful.

477
00:29:54,270 --> 00:30:07,348
Speaker 1: It's just gonna be videos of some guy shooting something or in the History Channel Videos of black and white footage from World War two while we talk in generic terms about the war and nothing interesting or new but this guy

478
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:07,408
Speaker 0: is

479
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:15,002
Speaker 1: At least he's acting as if he is not in fact one one of those Military fanboys the military otaku.

480
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,570
Speaker 1: they check out this weapon.

481
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:19,723
Speaker 1: I can kick some ass with this weapon like you feel the guy.

482
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:25,830
Speaker 1: he has the Probably minor hard-on talking about these weapons and I've seen other videos with this guy before.

483
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,981
Speaker 1: This guy scares me a little bit and I hope that he's acting.

484
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:33,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy is a. He's one of those guys where he's like, you know, he's.

485
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:34,563
Speaker 0: it's sort of like.

486
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,370
Speaker 0: ever see Full Metal Panic, right?

487
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,135
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean Full Metal Alchemist?

488
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,118
Speaker 0: No Full Metal Panic.

489
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:42,289
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, yeah, I guess a real movie as opposed to a geek movie.

490
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:44,719
Speaker 0: Well panic wasn't a geek.

491
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:45,401
Speaker 0: It was an anime.

492
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:48,682
Speaker 1: I Was thinking about Full Metal Jacket.

493
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:49,610
Speaker 0: No Full Metal Panic.

494
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,275
Speaker 1: I didn't actually see that.

495
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:55,810
Speaker 0: but you know Full Metal Panic is about this military guy who has to like hide in high school.

496
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,144
Speaker 0: But yeah, he's totally a military fanboy and he freaks everyone out all the time.

497
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:00,350
Speaker 0: That's what this guy's like.

498
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:05,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually grew up near a lot of people who are kind of like that, you know, Michigan militia that sort of thing.

499
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:06,079
Speaker 1: survivalist.

500
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,278
Speaker 1: enough jobs Yeah, these people are scary and that is the gist of this video.

501
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,210
Speaker 1: but enough talk about scary military fanboys.

502
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:15,815
Speaker 1: Check out this weapon.

503
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:23,707
Speaker 1: it can fire a blow anyway, so, uh All right, I got in a giggly fit there.

504
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,859
Speaker 1: but Network attached storage.

505
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:26,442
Speaker 1: Yep.

506
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,889
Speaker 1: That's what we're gonna talk about tonight.

507
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,324
Speaker 0: We're not gonna go in a great detail of like how to set it up.

508
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,690
Speaker 1: free ness free ness.

509
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,579
Speaker 0: But these are the solutions of the free ness ness.

510
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,990
Speaker 0: light open filer by drobo by a buffalo thing.

511
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,814
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of things.

512
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:44,850
Speaker 1: buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo right.

513
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,213
Speaker 0: What is a naz?

514
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:48,637
Speaker 0: naz is nas.

515
00:31:48,717 --> 00:31:51,143
Speaker 0: it stands for network attached storage.

516
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:55,658
Speaker 0: now don't confuse it with San Storage area network.

517
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:04,629
Speaker 1: the difference pretty much from a from your perspective Is that a naz is a little box full of hard drives connected to a network and you can just get files off of it.

518
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:18,530
Speaker 1: Yes, an is what a company like the companies I have worked for puts their like mission critical production data on terabytes and terabytes Worth well the floor area like yeah, and then like multiple servers will connect to it with fiber optics.

519
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:19,473
Speaker 1: The.

520
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:24,010
Speaker 0: the technical difference between a San and a naz is that when you connect to a naz, right?

521
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,359
Speaker 0: Your computer thinks of it as a network drive.

522
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,004
Speaker 0: It doesn't just you know, it goes.

523
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:32,209
Speaker 0: All right, I'm gonna use NFS I'm gonna use Samba.

524
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:44,090
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use something like that some network file transferring sharing folder protocol To connect to some drives in some other computer somewhere just to read and write files.

525
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:49,490
Speaker 1: Yeah with this and mount those things as though there are local says you can and all this stuff.

526
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:59,010
Speaker 1: But if under the hood under the hood though, it's still using one of those protocols Yeah, well the thing is they use a protocol that basically make them operating system or access method agnostic.

527
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:07,269
Speaker 1: Yes in that they don't care what you're running because you connect to it via a known standard protocol But a San.

528
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,850
Speaker 0: Theoretically on paper the diff it unlike a naz your computer actually thinks it's a local drive.

529
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:15,616
Speaker 1: Like the way they'll work.

530
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:28,255
Speaker 1: like we had a lot of those the hospital haven't been my current company and we had him at IBM Where you have a big box full of like a raid six of a crazy number of hard drives And there's fiber coming out of the back and you connect servers Directly to that.

531
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:32,010
Speaker 1: and like you'll have a cluster of database servers and they all serve the database.

532
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:38,508
Speaker 1: But all of them share a common file system and the file system is handled by the sand.

533
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:39,250
Speaker 1: and it's crazy.

534
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:40,690
Speaker 1: You're never gonna have one.

535
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,340
Speaker 0: You're never gonna use a sand but a NAS.

536
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:51,037
Speaker 0: if you have more than one computer in your house Or if you have friends who come over to your house or anything like that Or if you're in college or if you're in college.

537
00:33:51,478 --> 00:33:57,321
Speaker 0: a NAS is a very good thing to have and nowadays They are very cheap and they're getting very popular.

538
00:33:57,763 --> 00:33:59,410
Speaker 0: So we're gonna tell you a little about NAS.

539
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,370
Speaker 0: Alright, so a NAS is network attached storage.

540
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,200
Speaker 0: You could just if you wanted to.

541
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:05,930
Speaker 0: you can turn any two computer into a NAS.

542
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:09,329
Speaker 0: All you need is a computer and a single hard drive and you could do a NAS.

543
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:17,226
Speaker 0: It is you can use a free NAS NAS lite open filer that any of these operating systems will set up a NAS easily for you though.

544
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:24,726
Speaker 0: I mean you can just install Ubuntu and then manually, you know set up file sharing and then you've got a NAS, you know You don't have to do it with.

545
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:29,123
Speaker 0: you know You don't have to dedicate an entire Operating system to the NAS unless you want to have a box.

546
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:30,290
Speaker 0: that's a NAS and nothing else.

547
00:34:30,581 --> 00:34:41,449
Speaker 1: Yeah but before we talk about all like the how to set it up or what you'd want to do or you know all the different intricacies of Not sans but NAS is talk about why you would want one.

548
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,168
Speaker 1: very Layman's terms like what do they give you us?

549
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:51,429
Speaker 1: I mean I could just Share my Samba and Scott could share his Samba and the Mac downstairs could share it Sam.

550
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,920
Speaker 1: But we can all connect to whatever we want.

551
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:54,049
Speaker 1: So how is it better?

552
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:56,726
Speaker 0: Well, let's say, you know, I want to give you some mp3s, right?

553
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:03,819
Speaker 0: Well now I got to open up your Samba and drag the files over to you and put them on your hard drive and now They're on my hard drive and your hard drive.

554
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,870
Speaker 0: and then you know, you want to get some files for me.

555
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,510
Speaker 0: So, you know open up mine you copy files from you to me And then we got to go down to the Mac and now I want to get some files.

556
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,221
Speaker 0: Do I go to rim?

557
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:12,830
Speaker 0: do I go to Scott?

558
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,352
Speaker 0: Where do I go?

559
00:35:13,473 --> 00:35:16,470
Speaker 1: or Scott Johnson comes over and we want to give him like all our ROMs?

560
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,258
Speaker 1: Well, the ROMs are on five different computers.

561
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:19,323
Speaker 1: You got to connect to all of them.

562
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:20,488
Speaker 1: figure out what you want grab it.

563
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:31,970
Speaker 1: Would it be nice if there was just a central box called I don't know naz.local and you connect to it and all the important files you would ever share are on there.

564
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:39,819
Speaker 0: yes, you have one box full of hard drives just sitting somewhere in your house hidden away and You know on your computer the one you actually use.

565
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:43,150
Speaker 0: all you have in there is like the operating system and the software that you use.

566
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:49,890
Speaker 0: You know your Firefox your games, whatever and your mp3s, you know your documents all that other stuff that you use.

567
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,954
Speaker 0: You know your files.

568
00:35:51,355 --> 00:35:55,430
Speaker 0: you keep them on this central drive somewhere else, you know, and it'll probably be a raid.

569
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:56,277
Speaker 0: So it'll be.

570
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:57,629
Speaker 0: you know, you have backups of it.

571
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,933
Speaker 0: It'll be nice and safe.

572
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:03,025
Speaker 0: And even if your computer gets fried all your data is safe.

573
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:08,170
Speaker 0: on this other drive on your computer There's just software that you can download again And also now it's all from CD again.

574
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,873
Speaker 0: Who cares like?

575
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:15,830
Speaker 1: you can have your home directories or all sorts of things on there so that every computer in your house Can get all your data all the time without you having to do anything.

576
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:16,954
Speaker 0: Yeah You don't have to worry about.

577
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,843
Speaker 0: is the mp3 on this computer that computer?

578
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:24,141
Speaker 0: all your mp3s are in one's Drive in one place accessible from any computer in the house.

579
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:25,144
Speaker 0: You can bring.

580
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,448
Speaker 0: someone brings a laptop in up.

581
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,593
Speaker 0: They just connect.

582
00:36:28,175 --> 00:36:30,985
Speaker 0: all their files are there that they you know, you let them have access to.

583
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:38,010
Speaker 0: you know with the guest account Whatever they can get all the music all the movies one place easy to access, you know rim download something.

584
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:39,496
Speaker 0: It goes on to the Nez.

585
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:42,590
Speaker 0: when I want to go watch a video I go up in the video folder on the Nez.

586
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:44,750
Speaker 0: Oh, look all the things rim downloaded are already in there.

587
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,212
Speaker 0: I don't have to.

588
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:46,558
Speaker 0: you know, they're there.

589
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,106
Speaker 0: I don't have to go and look it around.

590
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,010
Speaker 0: What did rim download?

591
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,993
Speaker 0: What did I download?

592
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,517
Speaker 0: What's downloaded on the other computer?

593
00:36:51,738 --> 00:36:58,606
Speaker 1: now if you're living with other people which that's why we said college is a Big place for this or you got roommates or you got a family.

594
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:01,999
Speaker 1: and you know I have my mp3 collection Scott as his mp3 collection.

595
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,146
Speaker 1: Emily and Alex both have their mp3 collections.

596
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:07,495
Speaker 1: What if we Consolidated all of our kiss?

597
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:08,579
Speaker 1: look right now.

598
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,307
Speaker 1: I have a separate collection from Scott.

599
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,642
Speaker 1: So on my computer I have every song.

600
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:13,650
Speaker 0: we don't actually have a nasty.

601
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:19,848
Speaker 1: No I have every song from initial D ever and Scott has the exact same collection of mp3s.

602
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:30,170
Speaker 1: that's super redundant and waste a lot of space and Administration and all sorts of what if we just took our mp3 collections merge them together so that there was the authoritative one?

603
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:31,048
Speaker 0: That would take a long time.

604
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:36,349
Speaker 1: But once it's done or if we'd like all new music we get we put on the sand or the NAS, right?

605
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:41,089
Speaker 0: So I keep mine, it's slowly but surely we put more and more music over there.

606
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we move collections of things over there.

607
00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:45,249
Speaker 1: It's like all the initial D music.

608
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:47,058
Speaker 1: fine We know we both have the same files.

609
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:49,812
Speaker 1: or I just downloaded the whole lutena ost.

610
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:54,769
Speaker 1: so we both delete all of our antenna crap and then we just get it from the sand or the NAS.

611
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,514
Speaker 1: and Eventually, there's nuts.

612
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:01,690
Speaker 1: and I say sand because in my work, I've never done anything but like the highest of enterprise.

613
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,161
Speaker 1: So yeah, but I deal we're never going to have a sand.

614
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,909
Speaker 0: people give up now unless you even if you win a lot You're never gonna have one.

615
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:19,910
Speaker 1: I mean look we do geek nights right at most like the most we're ever gonna have is gonna be a rack with like Three servers in it and one router and maybe one switch and that would pretty much be everything we'll ever need forever.

616
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,357
Speaker 1: Yep, you might upgrade those servers.

617
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:29,516
Speaker 0: thing about NAS is is that you know when we were in college we were thinking wow soon It'll be to the point where for a thousand dollars You can have a terabyte.

618
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:32,430
Speaker 0: now you can buy single drives that are a terabyte.

619
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,811
Speaker 0: You can get like five of those things for like a thousand dollars, you know it's.

620
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:48,490
Speaker 0: you're getting to the point where you can have a lot of storage and a small amount of physical space for really cheap and You buy a NAS and you'll be able to store your videos and your music and everything forever in one nice easy place.

621
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:51,669
Speaker 0: When it'll be nice that you get backups and you get raid and it's safe.

622
00:38:52,011 --> 00:38:53,598
Speaker 1: Well, you the thing is it depends if you're.

623
00:38:54,161 --> 00:39:00,650
Speaker 1: if you're backing stuff up to it Independently of other collections then yeah, you have backups of the things you have backed.

624
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,426
Speaker 0: That's sort of what Apple's new time capsule is all about.

625
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:13,037
Speaker 1: It's just an ass yep, but if you put all your files on it, then you have the one kind of backup the live backup in that if a Drive dies or something the raid takes care of it.

626
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:17,150
Speaker 1: You replace the drive and everything's cool, but you don't have backup backup.

627
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,330
Speaker 0: So I was assuming that you were smart enough to back up the NAS to somewhere else.

628
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:27,110
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is there's no media other than tapes that could fit the whole thing on another NAS.

629
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:43,610
Speaker 1: So yeah What I was gonna say is if you're cool and you got money and you really want to have your data safe You have a NAS and all your files are on it Then you have another NAS that's running maybe a slower like slower drives that are more reliable or a more reliable slower kind of raid.

630
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:48,977
Speaker 1: there's all sorts of things you could do and You back up Periodically and they're there did.

631
00:39:48,997 --> 00:39:51,950
Speaker 1: we should do a show on exactly how to back up data like the schema.

632
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:56,204
Speaker 0: Another good idea is if you just keep your files on your local computer, right?

633
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:57,810
Speaker 0: It's because it's probably it's faster than that.

634
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:01,269
Speaker 1: I mean look I have like 700 gigs of space on my computer.

635
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:02,658
Speaker 1: now I'm like an eighth of that.

636
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,310
Speaker 0: you keep your files on your computer.

637
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:12,750
Speaker 0: You just back them up to the NAS with the time capsule is supposed to be If your computer hard drives crash, you can just get all your files from the NAS again.

638
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:16,370
Speaker 1: You can also read only access all the files from other computers.

639
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,339
Speaker 1: So the laptop can get all.

640
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:24,762
Speaker 1: your mp3 is via the backup read only But yet the master copy is still on your computer to update and change and whatever.

641
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,630
Speaker 1: then the updates get replicated every night or whatever.

642
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:31,116
Speaker 1: Yep There's not much more to say than that other than that.

643
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:40,146
Speaker 1: We're coming into the time where I feel like every technologically proficient Geeky household that has money and they're getting cheap to her.

644
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,250
Speaker 1: You can always pretty cheaply.

645
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,118
Speaker 0: We're also getting to the point where people are.

646
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,082
Speaker 0: they're not using so much software, you know You're using Firefox and web-based stuff more and more.

647
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:51,050
Speaker 0: you have less software on your computer.

648
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:56,327
Speaker 0: What computer you use matters less and less, you know, and it you know.

649
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:59,930
Speaker 0: people have laptops They're moving around they're changing computers all the time.

650
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:08,540
Speaker 0: I use Google Apps so much but you know the less people use local installed software the less people are stuck to any one computer.

651
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:28,525
Speaker 0: and if you really want to free yourself from having to use a specific computer And NAS is a great way to do that because you can use any Computer and as long as you can connect to your NAS it's like you're you know at your personal computer Even though it could be like your friend's computer, you know, cuz you got Firefox You can connect all your shit on the web and you connect to the NAS.

652
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:29,710
Speaker 0: But what else do you need?

653
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:36,330
Speaker 1: It's like your home and also I know a lot of you because most new motherboards support gigabit Ethernet just like straight up.

654
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:39,045
Speaker 1: I mean my motherboard does but I haven't used it.

655
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:48,874
Speaker 1: cuz I've no reason to switch when you give it switch, but Geeks what you can do and this is something that I will do eventually like we ever get something like this I'll do it.

656
00:41:49,277 --> 00:41:50,850
Speaker 0: I don't get a house gigabit wiring.

657
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,550
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I don't need gigabit for the main network.

658
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,177
Speaker 1: That's kind of silly.

659
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:59,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the gigabit is faster than the cable modem So it wouldn't help.

660
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:05,210
Speaker 1: but what you can have is a parallel network And if you're a geek you can run wires all over your house.

661
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,227
Speaker 1: Anyways, you don't care though wireless things like the time capsule are actually really cool.

662
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:10,231
Speaker 1: Don't discount them You're.

663
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:12,539
Speaker 1: you don't need that good performance.

664
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,446
Speaker 0: Wireless is fast enough for you people.

665
00:42:14,486 --> 00:42:19,103
Speaker 1: Trust me pretty much I mean if you're streaming like HD, whatever then you're probably need a wire.

666
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:20,810
Speaker 1: but what you do for cool, right?

667
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,105
Speaker 1: If you want it like you're one of those people's like man I want to use all the cool stuff my computer has.

668
00:42:25,185 --> 00:42:25,769
Speaker 1: I want to do it.

669
00:42:26,553 --> 00:42:29,930
Speaker 1: You have a two-tiered network where you have the normal switch, right?

670
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,082
Speaker 1: You can do this with one switch.

671
00:42:31,102 --> 00:42:37,710
Speaker 1: if you get a good switch You have the normal switch Connects to the router connects to the FiOS or the cable modem or whatever and all your computers connect to that.

672
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,130
Speaker 1: That's your normal network, but all these new motherboards you notice have two network holes.

673
00:42:42,615 --> 00:42:50,130
Speaker 1: You have a second network That is connected to by all your computers in the house and is not connected anywhere else not accessible to the internet.

674
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:57,970
Speaker 1: Nothing completely private and your run gigabit over that and the only thing on there is your local NAS and all your computers.

675
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:06,656
Speaker 1: Yep, so then you have a full backplane so you can stream as much as you want as fast as you possibly can faster The computer can hand you.

676
00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:09,250
Speaker 0: because right think about if you had one network, right?

677
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:11,249
Speaker 0: You only had one network and the NAS was on it.

678
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,798
Speaker 0: Well, let's say I'm downloading something from BitTorrent on.

679
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:14,901
Speaker 0: that's on the normal network.

680
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:17,830
Speaker 0: And then I'm also listening to music on the NAS.

681
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:23,630
Speaker 0: Well, now I'm downloading from two places into my computer through this normal sized network hole.

682
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:27,110
Speaker 1: A switch doesn't help you if your one computer is doing everything.

683
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:31,410
Speaker 0: Yes, you have one computer downloading from something in the house and it's also downloading from the internet.

684
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,690
Speaker 0: That's gonna clog that up cool right quick.

685
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:43,601
Speaker 0: But if the downloading from the thing in the house is on a separate network and the BitTorrent is on another network It's gonna be not interfering with each other.

686
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,930
Speaker 0: You're gonna have you know, they're using different bandwidth there.

687
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:52,750
Speaker 1: Also, it's just I don't know maybe it's cuz I'm a network geek but I like setting up complex network setups and something like that.

688
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,717
Speaker 0: It's not a bad network setup for an advanced house.

689
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:58,735
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is that's the kind of thing that enterprise, you know, whatever That's.

690
00:43:58,776 --> 00:43:59,429
Speaker 1: that's what you do.

691
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:05,610
Speaker 1: You have the backplane of data transfer and the kind of front plane or that the main network of everything else.

692
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:07,276
Speaker 0: I think a normal person though.

693
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:10,106
Speaker 0: Just a regular gigabit LAN in the house would be just fine.

694
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:14,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely Yeah, but it's something cool you can do and that's pretty much it.

695
00:44:14,672 --> 00:44:22,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want a Nez you can either just built like I said build a computer with some hard drives in it and then install some software that does network sharing and you're done.

696
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:30,498
Speaker 0: or many companies like Buffalo and Drobo and There's a whole bunch of companies.

697
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:31,604
Speaker 0: I forget the names of the other ones.

698
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:38,068
Speaker 0: they sell these boxes Right and sometimes the boxes come with drives and sometimes they don't and you just put drives in the box.

699
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,158
Speaker 0: if it doesn't come with Them it's a little tiny box.

700
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:42,250
Speaker 0: you plug the box in you connect to the network.

701
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:43,926
Speaker 0: It takes care of the rest for you.

702
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:44,953
Speaker 0: you're done Right.

703
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:45,817
Speaker 0: and the boxes?

704
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:52,824
Speaker 0: you can be anywhere from like a few hundred to like a thousand dollars Maybe even more depending on how many drives and what features it has.

705
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,630
Speaker 0: and just do your research on them.

706
00:44:54,971 --> 00:45:01,489
Speaker 0: You know, the Drobo is probably the simplest one because like USB, you know When it has some pretty advanced features, it looks cool.

707
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:08,747
Speaker 0: But this is other ones and if you want a Nez and you don't want to bother setting it up You can just buy a pre-built one and it's the easy way out.

708
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:11,406
Speaker 1: Yep We'll probably show in the future on.

709
00:45:11,426 --> 00:45:16,710
Speaker 1: you know How to set one up and how to go about all that business, but that is a much less interesting much more.

710
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:24,510
Speaker 0: We'll do this then do this Shows on the specific network sharing protocols like NFS and Samba and such.

711
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:30,970
Speaker 1: We also have to do a show on a like data schema and data storage and how you like information.

712
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:44,509
Speaker 1: I'll say this because this is kind of important the way that you structure how you save your data is becoming more and more Important because it is more and more difficult to get the data you want and to get it efficiently and to maintain it efficiently And to back it up efficient.

713
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,889
