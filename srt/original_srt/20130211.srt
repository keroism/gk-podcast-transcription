1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,511
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday February 11th 2013.

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:17,489
Speaker 0: I'm ran I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight talking about routers.

3
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,127
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:33,873
Speaker 0: So I'm walking down that long ramp just now coming back to the studio and from the four five six to the seven train Under Grand Central.

5
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,981
Speaker 1: Oh that ramp long ramp.

6
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:36,844
Speaker 0: It's pretty wet.

7
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:38,590
Speaker 0: So it's kind of slippery and it's downhill.

8
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:46,015
Speaker 0: I'm walking I'm walking and a girl next to me wearing these tall boots just like falls out of nowhere Just like our age.

9
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:46,718
Speaker 1: that'll happen.

10
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:50,350
Speaker 0: She just falls and she goes like and doesn't get up right away.

11
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:55,942
Speaker 0: So I kind of paused and do the kind of New York thing If you look a little bit just to see if it's something you should get involved with.

12
00:00:56,002 --> 00:01:05,964
Speaker 0: Yep, and her ankle is 90 degrees Okay, and she probably some weird-ass shoe and she's like trying to get up and like she can't get up and she's not yeah No for a second.

13
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:10,470
Speaker 0: I'm like, whoa But she's not really yelling or anything.

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,310
Speaker 0: So she her friends like get her up on her feet and then she reaches down and pulls her boot back up.

15
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:25,922
Speaker 0: She fell because her foot misaligned in the boot and the boot itself turned 90 degrees Yeah, and her foot was like six inches up in the boot.

16
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:27,005
Speaker 1: What the hell?

17
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:28,390
Speaker 1: Why don't you put your foot in your shoe?

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,092
Speaker 0: I don't know.

19
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:32,529
Speaker 0: So basically her fail was that she was wearing jank as boots.

20
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:42,245
Speaker 0: So I went from thinking she had broken her ankle sideways which would have been Kind of disturbing and I probably wouldn't have brought it up on geek nights to kind of funny instead.

21
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:43,890
Speaker 0: and it what seals?

22
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:47,822
Speaker 0: It is her friend Once like picks her up and she's like man.

23
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,209
Speaker 0: I told you these boots are shit.

24
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,997
Speaker 1: As brings up you are these things.

25
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:55,170
Speaker 1: this brings up something that is a bother of mine, right?

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,049
Speaker 1: That is often Exposed when people come to the city where much walking must happen.

27
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:05,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we had a friend who wears high heels when they visit us not even high heels But I am.

28
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:10,250
Speaker 1: I am opposed to any shoe that is not functional, right?

29
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,458
Speaker 1: It's like what is the point of a nice-looking shoe?

30
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:16,929
Speaker 1: you buy it because it's super nice-looking even though I don't agree that those Shoes are even nice-looking.

31
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,264
Speaker 1: personally That egg cannot be worn or walked in or run in or anything, right?

32
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:24,990
Speaker 0: I have one metric in New York City.

33
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:40,750
Speaker 0: Can you walk as fast as I plan to walk For at least a mile on New York City streets without with neither discomfort Nor damage to the shoe because they are damaged to your foot because if you cannot you probably either shouldn't wear those shoes.

34
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:42,950
Speaker 0: I wouldn't come to New York, right?

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,850
Speaker 0: If you're way shorter than me then you basically we have to prorate your speed of walking to how long your legs are.

36
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,412
Speaker 0: I'll give you that.

37
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:50,014
Speaker 0: Hmm.

38
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:59,530
Speaker 0: I 4.6 miles per hour down the street at a sustained rate because for them that's running.

39
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,864
Speaker 0: But I guess I got a much more related thing that happened.

40
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:04,526
Speaker 0: So work today.

41
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,418
Speaker 0: coworker Had a problem.

42
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:14,926
Speaker 0: He has an old laptop and basically the reason I Like a year - that's not that old.

43
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:15,409
Speaker 1: It's kind of old.

44
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:30,938
Speaker 0: So basically I'm asking you this Kim curious if you would suggest what I did because I was the office hero Because I gave advice and he was able to recover the data hard drive and Laptop got immersed in water.

45
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,990
Speaker 0: Oh, let's forget about how laptop fucked.

46
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:36,062
Speaker 0: Done forget the laptop.

47
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:37,010
Speaker 1: Okay, take the hard drive.

48
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,181
Speaker 0: Yep, he dried it and everything.

49
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:50,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you waited days But like you do, you know if a hard drive if you get a phone or something What you turn it off take the battery out and just wait a few days And hope it dries out and see if it'll start at the end.

50
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:51,874
Speaker 0: So he does that.

51
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:52,737
Speaker 0: and what he does?

52
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,322
Speaker 0: he takes one of those external enclosure.

53
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:59,322
Speaker 0: things up good idea plugs it in Mm-hmm, and just turns on the power.

54
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,950
Speaker 0: doesn't look into a computer just turns on the power.

55
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,594
Speaker 0: It's a good idea.

56
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:02,037
Speaker 1: Good idea.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,719
Speaker 0: And all it does is go click Click Oh click nothing happens.

58
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,050
Speaker 0: Oh, so he of course tries plug into a computer same thing.

59
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,615
Speaker 0: It just goes click click.

60
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:13,597
Speaker 0: So Scott.

61
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,165
Speaker 0: My question to you is in that situation.

62
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:16,807
Speaker 0: It's magnetic.

63
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:17,790
Speaker 0: Obviously what?

64
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,860
Speaker 0: yes it's a spinning disk a Ladled standard laptop size SATA spinning disk.

65
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,727
Speaker 0: I think it's 80 gigs or 120 something like that.

66
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,545
Speaker 0: Mmm, what would you suggest he do?

67
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:34,480
Speaker 1: There are three tricks I know each of which are the more extreme option.

68
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,289
Speaker 1: right option number one smack it once then try again.

69
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:41,615
Speaker 1: option number two The old freezer trick.

70
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:50,701
Speaker 1: but I would be hesitant on the freezer trick because of the water possibility But with the three days of drying I would be.

71
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:50,961
Speaker 1: so.

72
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:52,907
Speaker 0: the freezer trick works, of course straight up.

73
00:04:52,947 --> 00:05:00,804
Speaker 1: they basically You put in a ziplock bag you put it in the freezer you take it out You know start up and you get the data off really quick before breaks again.

74
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:04,237
Speaker 0: So basically, yeah We thought along the exact same lines.

75
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:04,678
Speaker 0: We know.

76
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,030
Speaker 1: and an option three is the bathroom clean room.

77
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:12,190
Speaker 0: Scott I think you and I know the same amount about hard drives.

78
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,569
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't we?

79
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,315
Speaker 0: Well, there's some things like.

80
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:16,541
Speaker 0: I know more about networking.

81
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,089
Speaker 1: You had a freezer at work that you used.

82
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, how long?

83
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:20,281
Speaker 1: how long did you put it in the free?

84
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:22,876
Speaker 0: and so basically he's like Well, how do I get the data off?

85
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,150
Speaker 0: and I was like, did you try hitting it?

86
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,732
Speaker 0: He's like what?

87
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:26,777
Speaker 0: and I'm like, well you get his.

88
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:29,950
Speaker 0: I explained like the torque and how you want to get it spinning again.

89
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,250
Speaker 1: Maybe just the thing is off the edge of the discs and you know the reader and if you smack it'll bounce back.

90
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:35,661
Speaker 0: Okay, but now that's not gonna work.

91
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:42,490
Speaker 0: So basically I'm like, alright Here's what I would suggest and I explained like let's put it in the ziplock bag put it in the freezer.

92
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:46,330
Speaker 0: I said at least two hours, which is about right for a consumer freezer.

93
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,290
Speaker 1: I would have been slightly wary because of the water but it's already dead.

94
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:57,449
Speaker 0: So I mean I would assume that the water was gone because it's been dried for a long time And if water got in like fully water is very unlikely to get in.

95
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,989
Speaker 1: It's most likely to be on the contacts on the board if the water was still in there.

96
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:06,657
Speaker 1: Then it's fucking water is very unlikely to get in where the discs are But it'll get maybe into where the bearings are.

97
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:10,570
Speaker 0: That's what I was thinking.

98
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:18,001
Speaker 0: the main reason these tricks work is because you're trying to just reduce the the Torque necessary to get that disc spinning.

99
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:19,830
Speaker 0: because once it's spinning you're good.

100
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,210
Speaker 1: Unless the control you have to get the the reader has to fly on the surface.

101
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:26,943
Speaker 0: It might if it falls off, but those are all secondary problems.

102
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,830
Speaker 0: and the click click click was obvious.

103
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:30,769
Speaker 0: It can't spin the disc up at all.

104
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:32,196
Speaker 0: If it did nothing.

105
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:35,570
Speaker 0: I would assume the controller was dead if it had spun up, but there was no data.

106
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:43,706
Speaker 0: I would assume there's some problem in the platters, but the fact that it did the click click Click like that meant it was trying to spin the disc up.

107
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:48,730
Speaker 0: hmm So I'm explaining like what to do and he's looking at me and now the whole office is watching like what?

108
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,436
Speaker 1: What did you bet money on it?

109
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:55,249
Speaker 0: No, I was like it can't hurt just trust me.

110
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,210
Speaker 0: So he does it and sure enough spun up just fine got all the data off of it.

111
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,961
Speaker 1: Can't they never heard of the freezer trick?

112
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:07,405
Speaker 1: now you hired a whole bunch of Technological people to work at a company that make software and not one of them knows guys are trick.

113
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:11,457
Speaker 0: most tech people I know Don't know how to recover data from hard drives.

114
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:20,267
Speaker 0: hmm because that is a skill that was only relevant in the day Back when one you and I we could only afford one hard disk.

115
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,300
Speaker 1: now I have some more than I need.

116
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:23,550
Speaker 1: I got rid of a bunch of them.

117
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:28,710
Speaker 0: You'd buy a new hard disk But you're gonna fill it up with stuff and the old one you never to put that data.

118
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:29,432
Speaker 0: We didn't.

119
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:34,350
Speaker 0: couldn't afford an external hard disk back then no and also back then spinning discs.

120
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,638
Speaker 0: We're way more prone to failure.

121
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:44,097
Speaker 0: They were yeah, so we and Even if I backed up my data I couldn't afford to buy a new disc.

122
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:47,858
Speaker 0: so if it has died like anything I could do to get it spinning again just To use it for another day.

123
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,469
Speaker 1: Why don't we try to put the old?

124
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,536
Speaker 1: The old disc in the freezer?

125
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:52,341
Speaker 0: you know that my oldest.

126
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:55,276
Speaker 0: you think I didn't try that You think I didn't try.

127
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,240
Speaker 0: it's the platter thing.

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,525
Speaker 0: I think is the only way to get that data.

129
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:05,290
Speaker 0: hmm though I looked and apparently it's only a few thousand dollars now for like those data recovery people instead of the few tens of thousand.

130
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,763
Speaker 1: Is it worth a few thousand dollars to get that mp3?

131
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, it might be.

132
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:11,894
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll kick start.

133
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:12,657
Speaker 0: I'll kick start.

134
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,927
Speaker 0: Let's see if we can get that mp3.

135
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:19,752
Speaker 1: That's all you Tell you.

136
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:21,460
Speaker 0: so it's a it's Monday.

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,263
Speaker 0: It's not the lounge.

138
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:22,906
Speaker 0: It's tech day.

139
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:23,749
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

140
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:27,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's a rumor going around and I love this room.

141
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,717
Speaker 1: There's no real good news going on.

142
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:34,090
Speaker 1: so it's good as rumor news is rumor of Apple watch.

143
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:40,924
Speaker 1: But this rumor was an old rumor and it's been reinvigorated and I kind of want one.

144
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:43,357
Speaker 0: I've wanted one forever.

145
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:52,430
Speaker 0: the only reason I didn't kick start the pebble is that Because the pebble and this is just me with my own uninformed opinion not slandering or labeling or anything.

146
00:08:53,412 --> 00:09:02,369
Speaker 0: To me a thing like the pebble coming through Kickstarter mostly out of nowhere Implies that it'll probably work and do what it says.

147
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:24,810
Speaker 0: But the time to market for something like that versus say if Apple or Google did it for their respective platforms the time to market is gonna be so much shorter for Apple or Google and they have so much more access to R&D and manufacturers that even if the pebble comes out tomorrow a Month after that the Apple one is gonna be a hundred times better.

148
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,930
Speaker 1: It's funny that you said that because I just got an email today and you know what the email said.

149
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:31,258
Speaker 0: Your hexbrite flashlight shipped.

150
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:32,824
Speaker 1: your pebble watch has shipped.

151
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:34,008
Speaker 0: Oh you kick-started it.

152
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:34,510
Speaker 1: I did.

153
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:41,370
Speaker 1: And so the thing is if this Apple watch comes out You can expect an eBay listing pebble watch for sale.

154
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:55,389
Speaker 1: But yeah the thing about this app new Apple watch rumor is it's combined with a non rumor of Corning willow glass and Corning is pretty much number one glass there is.

155
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:58,163
Speaker 1: Their factory is in New York.

156
00:09:58,425 --> 00:09:58,887
Speaker 1: I've been there.

157
00:09:58,988 --> 00:09:59,350
Speaker 1: It's cool.

158
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:05,096
Speaker 1: and the willow glass is basically this flexible glass and Theoretically you can.

159
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:08,330
Speaker 1: right now when you make an LCD you have to basically make it in layers.

160
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:22,750
Speaker 1: So it's like you get the color layer and the light and then a piece of glass and another piece of glass and then the Touchscreen glass goes on top right with this willow glass Everything in the willow glass which is in itself thinner than any of those individual layers and is flexible.

161
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:27,118
Speaker 1: so This you know.

162
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:29,090
Speaker 1: there could be some ridiculous Apple watch.

163
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,095
Speaker 1: I guess on paper.

164
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:39,855
Speaker 1: that would be like ultimate future where it's a strip of glass There's a strip of glass with a watch in it, and you wrap it around your wrist even though It's entirely made of glass.

165
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,421
Speaker 0: This is what people are saying.

166
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:45,598
Speaker 0: the problem with high with with Kickstarter But more in general that just that.

167
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,869
Speaker 0: the idea of yeah Why don't I have a watch?

168
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,935
Speaker 0: That does what you know.

169
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:54,930
Speaker 0: back in the day the watch was just a convenient way to show a very useful metric of information.

170
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:59,800
Speaker 0: Now I have so much information on my phone Why don't I just have another display on my wrist?

171
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,206
Speaker 0: like why don't we have that?

172
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:01,889
Speaker 0: the answer is?

173
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,678
Speaker 0: Material science battery science wireless science.

174
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,570
Speaker 0: there wasn't enough a consumer market processing power.

175
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,894
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons we're right about at the time where that can happen And it's a sure thing.

176
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:21,078
Speaker 0: so the actual specific implementation details of how it's done hardware and software is Literally all that matters.

177
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,190
Speaker 0: this has been the obvious idea for a decade.

178
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:33,301
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I hate watches mostly because I always lost Because I have that information somewhere exactly so and then it's like well Why do I want something that has a timer and a stopwatch?

179
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:34,367
Speaker 1: should I have that in my pocket?

180
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:34,970
Speaker 1: well now?

181
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:42,635
Speaker 1: It's at the point where aha if the watch doesn't suck Then that means I never have to take the thing out of my pocket Which is annoying.

182
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:43,540
Speaker 1: to do so.

183
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:48,522
Speaker 0: I actually have a kind of reason Why I'm gonna try out all these fancy watches.

184
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:52,035
Speaker 0: so back in the day like middle school I know I got watches.

185
00:11:52,437 --> 00:12:01,210
Speaker 0: I wore this watch in middle school because I wanted to know exactly what time it was Because I could do the cool thing like middle school kid like when you need to go out on that high note.

186
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,509
Speaker 0: You know middle school equivalent of a high note.

187
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:14,950
Speaker 0: it's the one day where you're sitting in class like in June right before school gets out and You're sitting in like fourth period English or something and your watch is timed where you know the exact second the bells gonna ring.

188
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,835
Speaker 0: Yep, so you just kind of get up and start walking toward the door, and it's usually like hey Where are you?

189
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,170
Speaker 0: and then the bell rings the second you hit the threshold?

190
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,811
Speaker 0: That's right.

191
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,944
Speaker 0: you you your whole middle school career to pull something like that off.

192
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:36,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, then in high school I realized that I don't want to know what time it is all the time But I want the ability to know what time it is But I don't want the time to always be like.

193
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:39,340
Speaker 0: oh You know if I'm waiting for like an allergy shot or something.

194
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:39,902
Speaker 0: I don't wanna be like.

195
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:48,310
Speaker 0: well four minutes have passed 401. fuck I'm bored, but I needed to know what time it was for example at RIT.

196
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,716
Speaker 0: If am I going to miss my class?

197
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:51,980
Speaker 0: I just get up.

198
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,077
Speaker 0: yes, I just woke up in an unidentified room I think in building six.

199
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:57,902
Speaker 0: who am I?

200
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:58,385
Speaker 0: what time?

201
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,330
Speaker 0: is it something?

202
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,364
Speaker 1: I just want to point out of all these watches right the pebble is like a hundred bucks.

203
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:10,042
Speaker 0: the Apple one who knows what it'll be right if it ever exists, but Pay six hundred bucks for one that did what I want like an awesome one.

204
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:12,110
Speaker 1: the point is even six hundred bucks.

205
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:17,852
Speaker 1: Compare that to the price of like the extremely fancy like Tag Heuer Folex.

206
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,820
Speaker 1: I mean Rolex real Rolex right it's like.

207
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:27,070
Speaker 1: it's ridiculous that the best watch in the world you know Technology-wise like a few hundred dollars.

208
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:34,473
Speaker 1: But like there's people still trying to sell watches for a whole jillion dollars because rich people buy Fashion statements.

209
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:37,783
Speaker 1: Rolex gotta put computers in that shit with no.

210
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:42,809
Speaker 0: that would actually ruin the reason Those people buy those things.

211
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:46,401
Speaker 0: Why they buy them purely for the fashion statement?

212
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,565
Speaker 0: They don't look at those watches.

213
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,050
Speaker 0: I've seen dude Scott.

214
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:50,610
Speaker 0: I go to business meetings.

215
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:57,330
Speaker 0: I meet people at conventions who have more money in their checking account than I will ever have made in my entire life.

216
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,442
Speaker 0: All right those dudes are wearing the $10,000 watch.

217
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:02,430
Speaker 0: they pull their cell phone out and look at it.

218
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,634
Speaker 0: See what time it is Straight up.

219
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:06,641
Speaker 1: isn't the watch really uncomfortable and big?

220
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,347
Speaker 0: I don't know they.

221
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:09,130
Speaker 0: they wear them.

222
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,786
Speaker 0: They probably wearing a watch for the last 40 years.

223
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:11,735
Speaker 1: That's the number one thing.

224
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,530
Speaker 1: all these watches is the discomfort.

225
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,110
Speaker 1: But I imagine a strip of glass that is flexible might be more comfortable.

226
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,209
Speaker 1: I just hope it's more comfortable than a stupid wristband thing that you get it mag fast.

227
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,323
Speaker 0: So I want to do there's a lot of obvious things that we could say.

228
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,290
Speaker 0: so I want to talk about the less obvious things.

229
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,190
Speaker 0: But this is an article talking about basically how and why?

230
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:48,167
Speaker 0: Professors and this extends to just teachers and faculty in general in educational institutions reject classroom technology and And there's a lot of easy low-hanging fruit things we could say about this.

231
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:49,870
Speaker 0: but obvious things yes.

232
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:57,003
Speaker 0: But to summarize them all one a lot of these teachers Just literally know nothing about technology.

233
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:57,766
Speaker 1: That's not a.

234
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:14,578
Speaker 0: Independently of that the people making the purchasing decisions for you know the IT Equipment or the software know nothing about technology, so they buy a busted ass like written in Delphi.

235
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:24,982
Speaker 0: it's a bird like Scheduling stain it's a plane and then they give it to the teacher who all who not only sucks at computers But also is going to suck it using this thing that itself sucks.

236
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:25,986
Speaker 1: It's captain obvious.

237
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,568
Speaker 0: meanwhile the kids I'll have their iPhones and their tablets, and they know better.

238
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:33,743
Speaker 0: But there's also a kind of a side that despite all of that.

239
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:41,044
Speaker 0: It's not just that these people don't know technology But reading some of the quotes of like what these people say about technology.

240
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:42,248
Speaker 1: Oh are they hilarious?

241
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:51,950
Speaker 0: it basically means That these people even if that you know they don't recognize that maybe the software They're getting is bad, but there could be a good solution.

242
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,866
Speaker 0: They reject the fundamental idea of bringing new technology into the classroom.

243
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:59,750
Speaker 1: well a lot of people You know what is to be gained?

244
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,720
Speaker 0: This is a quote for students by bringing IT into the class.

245
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,683
Speaker 0: there isn't any.

246
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,490
Speaker 0: you could teach all of chemistry with a whiteboard.

247
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:08,964
Speaker 0: I don't really think you need IT or anything beyond a pencil and a paper.

248
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:09,467
Speaker 0: Well.

249
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:16,046
Speaker 1: That's true You could teach chemistry with a chalkboard Could write software with a notepad.

250
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:25,870
Speaker 1: in my life scheme If you have a classroom full of children who are from this millennium and not the last one They're gonna be bored to fuck with your slow-ass boring whiteboard.

251
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:32,659
Speaker 1: And maybe if you had some IT that did cool stuff You could keep their fucking attention on the chemistry and then actually learn it.

252
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:47,847
Speaker 0: not even that there's basic things like the teachers like Managing grades and scheduling things that should be trivial, but it's the teachers seem to and obviously I'm generalizing, but the people who are the are going to bear the brunt of my ire in this article.

253
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,506
Speaker 0: anyone who's anti-technology are the people who are.

254
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:57,570
Speaker 0: They deny the fundamental idea that technology can be used to make something better because they're small minded.

255
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:57,871
Speaker 1: They don't.

256
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,250
Speaker 1: they're not technologically minded, then they see a technology in use that is bad.

257
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,029
Speaker 1: They don't know how to use it and make the most of it.

258
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,469
Speaker 1: So then they can't imagine one that doesn't suck because they don't know.

259
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,325
Speaker 0: But I ran into this all the time when I worked in the hospitals.

260
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,756
Speaker 0: I mean I had this one moment I talked about.

261
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:27,128
Speaker 0: this is the whole world 2006 or so on geek nights, but basically we were installing in a bunch of hospitals in New York State Prescription printers, so there you use some system to you know say it's the stickers that goes in the bottles right.

262
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,898
Speaker 0: no No, the actual prescription you take to the pharmacy

263
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:30,379
Speaker 1: okay,

264
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:33,710
Speaker 0: so rather than having a doctor write gibberish on a piece of paper

265
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:36,172
Speaker 1: Oh, it prints out a piece of paper The only

266
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:37,338
Speaker 0: way to write a prescription

267
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:38,082
Speaker 1: is to

268
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:44,262
Speaker 0: go into the system and say this drug This patient this dosage you know whatever and it has.

269
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:46,830
Speaker 0: then the printers are locked and have a serialized.

270
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,810
Speaker 0: So it prints with a unique barcode.

271
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:55,070
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's totally legit, so you can't fake a prescription and the doctor can't mess up a prescription.

272
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:57,763
Speaker 0: Hmm, and it's a. it was a great system.

273
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,727
Speaker 1: That's really good about.

274
00:17:58,788 --> 00:17:59,250
Speaker 0: it is great.

275
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:07,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, one doctor in particular, and this is the most egregious thing that happened But this sort of thing was the norm and not the exception.

276
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:13,669
Speaker 0: Literally I knocked on his door, and he's a little private office, and I was like hey I'm here to install your and he says get the fuck out of my office.

277
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:15,112
Speaker 0: And I'm like.

278
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:16,597
Speaker 0: but we scheduled this.

279
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:21,936
Speaker 0: I did and he's like I don't want your technology bullshit in my office I don't need a printer.

280
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:24,610
Speaker 0: and I point out he did not in fact have a printer in his office.

281
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,503
Speaker 0: I'm gonna write my prescriptions, New York State can't tell me what to do.

282
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:29,347
Speaker 0: do not leave it here.

283
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,130
Speaker 0: I'll throw it away.

284
00:18:30,773 --> 00:18:34,529
Speaker 0: Now I didn't really care about my job at that point cuz I decided to quit.

285
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,342
Speaker 0: anyway I would have fought with that guy so hard.

286
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:40,323
Speaker 1: I would have been like fine I guess I'll take all your x-ray machine - how about the stethoscope?

287
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,790
Speaker 1: because you apparently don't like technology.

288
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:48,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now instead what I did is I said fine And I left then went back to his office when he wasn't there.

289
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:52,118
Speaker 0: unlock the door because I have the master key And I installed it anyway mm-hmm.

290
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:52,902
Speaker 1: Did he throw it out?

291
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:53,685
Speaker 0: Yes?

292
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:55,793
Speaker 0: He threw it away Mm-hmm.

293
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,990
Speaker 0: he literally threw it in the garbage.

294
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:00,230
Speaker 0: We got a report from the loading dock people.

295
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,405
Speaker 0: They're like hey, it looks like someone threw away brand new equipment.

296
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:07,016
Speaker 0: you want to come take a look at it And I go and it's that printer.

297
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:08,787
Speaker 0: I'm like let me guess where this came from.

298
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:10,989
Speaker 1: Why don't you go tell his boss?

299
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:15,644
Speaker 1: If I was that would just be like you're fired.

300
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:17,453
Speaker 1: welcome to the 20.

301
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:18,929
Speaker 0: Why I did not tell his boss.

302
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:23,024
Speaker 0: This is this is completely non technology related rim anecdote.

303
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:24,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, well cuz you didn't care.

304
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:28,858
Speaker 0: so I've only ever quit one job In style.

305
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:30,710
Speaker 0: I believe it was that one.

306
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:36,746
Speaker 0: I believe firmly that everyone needs to quit at least one job at one point in their life in style.

307
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:41,984
Speaker 1: the big fuck you Just for one day then quit in style just to fulfill now.

308
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,230
Speaker 0: It's got to be justified.

309
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:56,880
Speaker 0: but so basically I was done with that fucking job and I but I In that court you know I had that printer right and I like took it and put it in this storage thing Temporarily, and then it was like the.

310
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:59,090
Speaker 0: it was like three days before I was gonna quit.

311
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:06,190
Speaker 0: so I take the printer and They'd like the office like oh you got to bring it back to the office so we can like do something with it.

312
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:07,756
Speaker 0: So I go to walk out of the hospital.

313
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:11,610
Speaker 0: the security guards like you can't leave with that without your requisition form.

314
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:13,910
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have a confiscator if you try to walk out this door.

315
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:17,882
Speaker 0: And I looked at him, and I was like all right.

316
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:19,608
Speaker 0: I handed it to him, and I just walked away.

317
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:20,070
Speaker 1: nice

318
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:37,766
Speaker 0: He was like ah and he really did not know what to do and was and I don't know what he did And then I quit and that was when I got swore at and then in the exit of you I told everyone what I thought of them and Don't regret doing that.

319
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:41,740
Speaker 0: no So I got one other little article I want to bring up because I can.

320
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,130
Speaker 0: we can answer this question very easily.

321
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:47,767
Speaker 0: Someone asked on slash shot is it possible to erase yourself from the internet?

322
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:50,500
Speaker 1: no no Depends how much you put on the internet.

323
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,653
Speaker 1: if you have never been on the internet ah You're already erased from it.

324
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,094
Speaker 1: Nope.

325
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,458
Speaker 0: I disagree okay.

326
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:57,621
Speaker 0: Here's the reason why.

327
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:03,660
Speaker 0: now yes, there might be a special case, but I Do not have a Facebook account mm-hmm.

328
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,810
Speaker 0: Let's assume that I have no other internet presence.

329
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,579
Speaker 1: I have friend who's never had a computer in your life.

330
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,285
Speaker 0: I just don't use the internet at all mm-hmm.

331
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,446
Speaker 0: so one now How do I even know?

332
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,208
Speaker 0: to you Thinking that I'm a Luddite just make a Facebook account put my name on and start tagging me and stuff.

333
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,941
Speaker 0: now There's a whole trail about me on the internet.

334
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:26,855
Speaker 0: people are taking pictures of me It's all there And I have no control over that.

335
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:31,267
Speaker 0: anyway the metadata of the people around you will involve you.

336
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:39,090
Speaker 0: the question of Erasing yourself from the internet is patently ridiculous as is the question of keeping yourself off the internet.

337
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:40,616
Speaker 1: You could just be someone who's.

338
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:41,279
Speaker 1: there are people.

339
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:43,950
Speaker 1: there is six billion people seven billion people on earth.

340
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:52,123
Speaker 1: Most of them have information about them on the internet, so yes the edge cases Most of humanity is as no information about.

341
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:59,093
Speaker 0: okay, so if you want to get into that argument among the first world elite Everyone's on the internet.

342
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:01,402
Speaker 0: Yes, the first world problem.

343
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:03,108
Speaker 0: Can you erase yourself from the internet?

344
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:03,690
Speaker 0: Yes?

345
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,506
Speaker 0: You know how go to the third world physically and never come back, but you do.

346
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:19,395
Speaker 0: information from your time Would still be in the internet But you can argue that it could no longer reach you because if you abandon your first world lifestyle You're still.

347
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:20,870
Speaker 1: there is data about you on the internet.

348
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,856
Speaker 1: You're not erased from it.

349
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:23,990
Speaker 1: even if you are dead you can kill yourself.

350
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,347
Speaker 0: But so the best you're doing there is preventing further information from appearing.

351
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:31,316
Speaker 0: so This kind of article appears.

352
00:22:31,336 --> 00:22:34,648
Speaker 0: I don't know every year and the answer has always been no.

353
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:41,069
Speaker 0: Now why do people keep asking do people not get that we're in a fundamentally new kind of society?

354
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:48,190
Speaker 0: no Except the people who are ready for the new kind of society Yeah, or the people who throw their internet away, so no one can put it in their office.

355
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:49,796
Speaker 1: You know you can see.

356
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,545
Speaker 1: it's all those people who turn their heads and the major walks down the street And she's just looking straight ahead.

357
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,150
Speaker 0: That is perhaps the best analogy to everything.

358
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:10,300
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day that now I kind of want to make it the opener to ghost in the show.

359
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:12,672
Speaker 0: Anyway, tomorrow is the new ghost in the show.

360
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:13,637
Speaker 1: is it really tomorrow.

361
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,084
Speaker 0: I suppose Title tomorrow.

362
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:16,827
Speaker 0: I don't know.

363
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:20,199
Speaker 0: all I know is that that event in Roppongi Hills is I believe tomorrow.

364
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:22,358
Speaker 1: Roppongi Hills yeah.

365
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:29,465
Speaker 0: Anyway my thing of the day, so we and geek nights not on the show But in the forum.

366
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:34,323
Speaker 0: the debate about gun control and whatever's been going on for a while I'm not talking about.

367
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:34,504
Speaker 0: well.

368
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:35,888
Speaker 0: No I the prop.

369
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:38,978
Speaker 0: my problem with that debate is not the issue.

370
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,270
Speaker 0: my problem Is that every debate about it on the internet is the same.

371
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,979
Speaker 1: points being made in every debate about everything on the internet.

372
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:45,200
Speaker 1: is the?

373
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,539
Speaker 1: Same and people have it over and over again, and they can't shut up.

374
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:49,707
Speaker 1: The only need one.

375
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:56,049
Speaker 1: leave it there and just greet it again, and don't type anything new Any of the topics that you know or bring.

376
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:56,370
Speaker 1: now.

377
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,273
Speaker 0: there is one difference.

378
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:00,242
Speaker 0: the problem is everyone has this sort of generic Bullshit argument.

379
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:14,540
Speaker 0: if you're gonna debate something like gun control on the internet the only reasonable way to have that debate is to put forth your personal Specific full opinion on the issue and Then get enough people to do that and look for consensus.

380
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,285
Speaker 0: But I digress.

381
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:19,687
Speaker 0: one of the topics that always comes up is What about when we can just print guns?

382
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:24,790
Speaker 0: because that's why my we've talked about this a hundred times we have but it's always been A pretty big hypothetical.

383
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,836
Speaker 1: I mean it's day of the day.

384
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,339
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

385
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:35,079
Speaker 0: I could make a zip gun but if I make a zip gun with PVC pipe and put anything other than like a 22 round in there not that gonna work out to so well.

386
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:48,267
Speaker 0: So here is a video of the straight-up lower receiver firing what appears to be a 5-7 pistol round and It works just fine.

387
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,536
Speaker 0: so someone printed.

388
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:51,705
Speaker 1: well It doesn't work just fine and breaks.

389
00:24:51,765 --> 00:25:02,980
Speaker 0: eventually it fires six shots and then breaks with a lot of shots for a commodity You know printed with like current maker bot technology without a lot of like extra work.

390
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:14,130
Speaker 0: That's pretty impressive because I'm thinking on the horizon of five years from now You can print an assault gun that lasts for one rampage worth of activity Because once you get one rampage out of it.

391
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,777
Speaker 0: You're pretty much good to go.

392
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much So.

393
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:22,620
Speaker 0: the probably the reason I bring this up is thing today because one it's cool to see the lower receiver.

394
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:29,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually discuss this often many times, but this is actually a video of it working a gun that someone printed.

395
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:37,310
Speaker 0: So if you're gonna have the debate use this video to piss off all the people who are trying to argue about gun control Because gun control is gonna be moot.

396
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,740
Speaker 0: as soon as we have maker bots that print metal Just like copyright law is moot gun control law will be moot.

397
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:46,940
Speaker 0: Except how come copyright law is not yet moot and a lot of people are getting really fucked over by it.

398
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,939
Speaker 0: Oh wait, because the same thing will happen with guns exactly.

399
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:57,380
Speaker 0: But I'm telling you in the next few years You're gonna get a printed assault rifle that has at least one rampage worth in it.

400
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,267
Speaker 1: Let's put have a betting pool.

401
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:06,176
Speaker 1: Everyone picks a date on the calendar to when the first Murder with a printed gun will occur.

402
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:08,742
Speaker 0: Here's a problem This.

403
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,825
Speaker 0: here's the problem with that betting pool Scott.

404
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,308
Speaker 0: I let's say I bet December 25th 2014 you do it.

405
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the toy sure go for it Go for it.

406
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:22,799
Speaker 0: So what do you got for me?

407
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:24,420
Speaker 1: So check this out.

408
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:24,960
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

409
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:33,794
Speaker 1: You know when you have some printed text right on and they can see a newspaper if your vision is good You can sort of sit comfortably if your vision is bad.

410
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:39,260
Speaker 1: You might have to get close to it You might have to squint you might have to use a eyeglass, you know, I'm at these various things.

411
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:49,113
Speaker 1: Control plus yeah, if you got a computer you might have to press some control plus control minus to make the text bigger smaller At least in a browser if it's not a browser.

412
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:50,339
Speaker 1: good luck, right?

413
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:55,220
Speaker 1: So what we have here is someone made a web page with this incredibly clever thing.

414
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:20,220
Speaker 1: It uses the HTML 5 webcam API to basically have the web page look at your face and it figures out based on facial recognition where your face is and how far away your face is from the Webcam assuming you have one of those webcams attached to the monitor Or built into the monitor like in a laptop and then as you get closer to the screen with your face It makes the text smaller and when you get farther away from the screen of their face.

415
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,305
Speaker 1: It makes the text bigger.

416
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:22,491
Speaker 1: have a girl.

417
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:27,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so you might think well wait I can't read the text so I get closer and it gets smaller.

418
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:28,660
Speaker 1: That doesn't help.

419
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,700
Speaker 1: I'll press ctrl plus a few times right to get it to be the right size and now it'll be really useful.

420
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:38,679
Speaker 1: I see this being the most useful and not sitting at the computer, right but these days.

421
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:50,828
Speaker 1: Well TVs maybe yes But also let's say you've got a tablet sitting on the counter and with a recipe Or something like that right and you take a few steps away to go to the fridge.

422
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:56,357
Speaker 1: you turn your head around to look at it and the text is Real big because it knows you walked far away from it.

423
00:27:56,418 --> 00:28:01,556
Speaker 1: now It says motherfucking cucumber and when you get back to it, you can see the whole recipe.

424
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:07,100
Speaker 0: while this is cool and cute Augmented reality will happen before it's practical and useful.

425
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,227
Speaker 1: I think in the extreme short term.

426
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:22,433
Speaker 1: if someone deploys this into a tablet because they all have webcams built in if someone makes this Feature built into the tablet OS the same way that say swipe is built into some Android devices It would have to be obviously much smoother.

427
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,000
Speaker 1: Yes, it would have to be improved here.

428
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,105
Speaker 0: Here's the main problem with it.

429
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:26,351
Speaker 0: It keeps reflowing the text.

430
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,340
Speaker 1: That's only because the webcams janky.

431
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:32,111
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying every time you change the font size you're reflowing text.

432
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:32,493
Speaker 1: Yep.

433
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,880
Speaker 0: Reflowing text is impossible to read wall.

434
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:36,967
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's the problem.

435
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:39,014
Speaker 0: It's the use cases around this.

436
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:40,620
Speaker 0: it would be to calibrate it.

437
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, even then basically as soon as someone's moving whenever you're reflowing the text is unreadable till they stop moving.

438
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:50,976
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure if Apple tried to put this in iPads and built it into iOS.

439
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:51,558
Speaker 1: It would work great.

440
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,410
Speaker 1: Now I'm just saying wouldn't take them more than maybe a month to get it right.

441
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:59,639
Speaker 0: getting from clever girl to in a production product Is what I kind of do now for a living and that I foresee.

442
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,040
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's not like swipe is taking over the world either right now, but it could reach that same level.

443
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:07,631
Speaker 0: This is really awesome right now.

444
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,560
Speaker 1: It's something some guy made on a web page.

445
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,880
Speaker 1: It's just cool to mess with and I'm betting it actually won't ever be used in any way for reals.

446
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:17,507
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying it's possible.

447
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:18,089
Speaker 0: make a bet.

448
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:19,895
Speaker 0: So what I would do is that pushed it.

449
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:21,220
Speaker 1: who is a device manufacturer?

450
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,439
Speaker 0: Here's what I would do with this.

451
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,400
Speaker 0: So remember there is a prank a long time ago where you could Oh use it for a prank website.

452
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,055
Speaker 1: Were you getting close and it goes now?

453
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,282
Speaker 0: I was gonna say this.

454
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:34,920
Speaker 0: so remember when people would make an image and people still do this.

455
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,660
Speaker 1: Like if you go to 4chan, yeah, we have a few seconds and it goes.

456
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:39,785
Speaker 0: No, no much more clever.

457
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:45,130
Speaker 0: so you can have an image that from up close looks like one thing but from far away It looks like something completely different.

458
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,360
Speaker 0: So I click on the image.

459
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:52,484
Speaker 0: I'll see a picture of a kitten because I'm sitting next to my monitor, but then my boss across the room sees a penis Like.

460
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,232
Speaker 0: that's pretty easy to do so.

461
00:29:56,241 --> 00:30:00,600
Speaker 0: Another thing you can do is you have a thumbnail that looks like one thing because the way the thumbnail is compressed.

462
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:03,299
Speaker 0: But when you click in the full image, it expands to the penis.

463
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:08,699
Speaker 0: So you could set this up to where it's always showing the penis to everyone except you.

464
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,261
Speaker 1: What?

465
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:13,529
Speaker 0: so it manipulates.

466
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,614
Speaker 1: it looks at one face.

467
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:17,626
Speaker 1: So if your face is close to this, okay So obviously wouldn't be perfect.

468
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,032
Speaker 0: but say there's someone across the room.

469
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:29,128
Speaker 0: if I get close to it It's gonna make it so that the big you know It'll make like the big image where I see what I'm looking at, but my boss sees the penis But if I get far away, it keeps you.

470
00:30:29,148 --> 00:30:34,059
Speaker 0: maybe it just keeps showing me the cat so I'll never figure it out Because it's locked onto your face.

471
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:54,840
Speaker 1: I think a better idea is just the real problem Is that to give to give the browser your permission to use the webcam so it'll get to say yes You can make a prank where someone gets their face closer and closer to the screen and then it goes They get all oh shit and it makes a good YouTube video because it's simultaneously capturing.

472
00:30:56,001 --> 00:31:02,599
Speaker 1: They're you know getting closer and surprise it is with the webcam while it's also evaluating their face distance dual purpose webcam.

473
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:07,232
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, we're gonna be at PAX East doing two or three lectures.

474
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:08,576
Speaker 1: We don't even know.

475
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:15,375
Speaker 0: mastering game mechanics Practical game theory and a one that is TBA and or TBD.

476
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:18,323
Speaker 1: This is in March something something I'm not gonna bother to look it up.

477
00:31:18,785 --> 00:31:22,174
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think April or May is anime Boston.

478
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:22,816
Speaker 0: Yep.

479
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:24,019
Speaker 0: I assume we'll be there.

480
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, Connecticut submit your panels.

481
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:27,531
Speaker 0: We are currently scheduling.

482
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:29,678
Speaker 0: I have personally scheduled like 11 panels.

483
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,711
Speaker 0: It's not public yet because we're gonna schedule in batches and then release them all.

484
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:40,415
Speaker 0: if you want to do a panel lecture workshop Juggling event, whatever submit them now because the longer you wait the less likely it is.

485
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:41,600
Speaker 0: I won't even look at your submission.

486
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:48,350
Speaker 1: the weekend after Kinetic on Paxos We gotta start working on all we gotta decide.

487
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,274
Speaker 0: we gotta decide for sure.

488
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:57,698
Speaker 0: if we're gonna go and start looking at plane We should get the time off where you get the hotel at least for that weekend in the Melbourne.

489
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:58,100
Speaker 1: Melbourne.

490
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:02,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we should at least get the hotel for the convention and we can worry about the other stuff.

491
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:03,200
Speaker 0: and I'm debating.

492
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:07,860
Speaker 0: You know Otacon ever since they blacklisted us basically never accepts panels from us anymore.

493
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:13,472
Speaker 0: So I'm debating just giving up entirely and just never going again hurt to send an email Yeah, but it.

494
00:32:13,512 --> 00:32:18,440
Speaker 0: but then again I'm at the point now where if so many other big cons going on that if Otacon was like accepts.

495
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:24,240
Speaker 0: It would be a shame if they blacklist us for years after doing like a decades worth of panels for them.

496
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:27,860
Speaker 0: They unblacklist us and we immediately turn them down depends on the weekend.

497
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even know what Otacon is.

498
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,420
Speaker 0: guys Tell us if you want us to be at Otacon and also tell Otacon if you want us to be at Otacon.

499
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:36,406
Speaker 1: I think people already did that.

500
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:37,671
Speaker 0: I don't know if they did or not.

501
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:44,640
Speaker 0: I think you were accused of a Conspiracy to incite a riot the last time we suggested that people suggest to Otacon that we come.

502
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:46,667
Speaker 0: I think I still.

503
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:48,320
Speaker 0: I think I saved that thread in the staff.

504
00:32:49,921 --> 00:33:02,107
Speaker 0: Everyone should go to the feedback panel and say something and then even though someone else already said it Later I get an email from some Otacon staff guy who's like we've got a Situation that we got to talk about.

505
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:04,056
Speaker 0: your co-host is trying to incite a riot.

506
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:05,060
Speaker 0: This is kurtie thing.

507
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,736
Speaker 1: I was like what I was like.

508
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:11,960
Speaker 1: Look, they really got to mail the badges and know what they still fucking have to mail the badges.

509
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:13,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone.

510
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:15,920
Speaker 1: if since they're not gonna mail them go up.

511
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:16,739
Speaker 1: This is what I said.

512
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:34,219
Speaker 1: I said everyone should go to the feedback panel go up to the microphone and say Mail the badges and then you sit down and then even though they already heard mail the badges which they hear every year anyway Someone else should go to the microphone and say mail the badges again and everyone who goes up should keep saying it

513
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,623
Speaker 0: Really

514
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,430
Speaker 1: drive it home and embarrass them mailing

515
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,052
Speaker 0: the badges.

516
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:42,675
Speaker 0: if your convention has more than like five thousand I mean Connecticut, I wish we would mail the badges.

517
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:43,600
Speaker 0: I want it to happen.

518
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,057
Speaker 0: I'm working for it as much as I can in my little fiefdom.

519
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:48,888
Speaker 0: Magfest really fucking needs to mail the badges.

520
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:50,293
Speaker 0: Oh good guys, though.

521
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:52,360
Speaker 1: Their line isn't too bad, but still mail the badge.

522
00:33:52,401 --> 00:34:04,483
Speaker 0: Oh, the line is not bad now But Magfest is growing rapidly and also mailing the badges means that they're gonna have to give up on their stupid wristband Which is my primary motivation there That wristband.

523
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:06,048
Speaker 0: All right, so in our topic.

524
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,797
Speaker 1: Oh the book club book is well the Greg Gatsby.

525
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:09,380
Speaker 0: We read it.

526
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,295
Speaker 0: We're gonna do shows probably next week.

527
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:11,920
Speaker 1: We'll do the episode.

528
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:17,820
Speaker 0: Scott you pick another book yet Maybe yeah, you're not gonna say I'll tell you next Thursday.

529
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,674
Speaker 1: All right, when I've really picked and of course forum videos you're ten of all that stuff.

530
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:23,275
Speaker 0: It's out there.

531
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:23,858
Speaker 0: It's happening.

532
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,402
Speaker 0: So routers We did.

533
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:33,309
Speaker 1: I tried to think of something we didn't do an episode on and I saw we did a printer episode and I think We did a mouse keyboard episode.

534
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:36,143
Speaker 1: So it's like well, let's try to cover all the equipment We didn't cover.

535
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:44,628
Speaker 1: so I want to point out we did an episode on home networking where I think we covered a lot of this area But we didn't do a show specifically on routers.

536
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,172
Speaker 1: so whatever loophole.

537
00:34:46,493 --> 00:34:47,175
Speaker 0: so here's the.

538
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:47,815
Speaker 0: here's my deal.

539
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,159
Speaker 0: I go to Rick Wikipedia.

540
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,460
Speaker 0: I have a router just for the show just in case you're talking about the power tool.

541
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,146
Speaker 0: So the descent.

542
00:34:54,186 --> 00:35:00,352
Speaker 0: there is a disambiguation page and of the four things here I think one of them really doesn't deserve to be here.

543
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:01,900
Speaker 0: Let's see if you can pick out which one.

544
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,070
Speaker 0: Okay router woodworking a rotating cutting tool.

545
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,299
Speaker 0: Yep router computing a computer networking device Routing electronic design automation software.

546
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:19,764
Speaker 0: MC router born 1986 nerdcore rapper, but Never even heard of him.

547
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,149
Speaker 1: really MC router.

548
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,854
Speaker 1: He has a Wikipedia page.

549
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,500
Speaker 1: You should mark him as not notable.

550
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:26,455
Speaker 0: She has a Wikipedia page.

551
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:31,758
Speaker 1: Okay, nice But yeah mark is not notable unless they're notable and I've just never heard of them because I'm not that into it.

552
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:41,299
Speaker 0: Ah She is looking at these press things about as notable as we are But I don't think she deserves to be on the router disambiguation page.

553
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:46,660
Speaker 0: Like if the I don't know podcast disambiguation page was like geek nights.

554
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:57,539
Speaker 1: Well, if you were on the geek disambiguation page like geek or the night disambiguation Night the time of day opposite daylight geek nights.

555
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:04,524
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we're talking about computer routers in Computing.

556
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:04,946
Speaker 1: okay.

557
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:07,600
Speaker 1: So what for those of you who are really out of the loop?

558
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,489
Speaker 1: what the hell does at least a home router do?

559
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:11,612
Speaker 1: and basically what it does?

560
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:21,240
Speaker 1: is you get a cable modem or a DSL or a FiOS or something and it's only got one ethernet cable coming out of that motherfucker and you got five motherfucking computers.

561
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:24,859
Speaker 1: How do you plug a whole bunch of computers to get internet for that one guy?

562
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,480
Speaker 1: You plug a router into that guy then you plug all the computers into the router.

563
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:32,777
Speaker 0: Well, well, let's back up a little bit because in the home world, you know, there was a time where?

564
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,028
Speaker 0: Switches were not generally available to the consumer.

565
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,455
Speaker 0: No, nor were routers.

566
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:46,500
Speaker 0: No, you had to buy a hub so I would have a cable modem and Directly plugged into that would be my computer.

567
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:49,740
Speaker 1: Well in the dial-up days you couldn't do shit, right?

568
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,680
Speaker 1: The computer had basically had a dial-up modem in it And if you wanted to share the internet you had to share it had an external modem, right?

569
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,620
Speaker 1: You had to basically share the internet from that computer that had the modem on it to the other computer.

570
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:01,929
Speaker 0: You want to share your 300 bod exactly.

571
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, you kids even know what bod means without looking it up and why we don't use that term anymore.

572
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:10,783
Speaker 0: bod.

573
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:24,063
Speaker 0: I had a 300 bod modem I Yeah, then I upgraded to a 2400 bod which could almost play mad maze but not quite anyway, so Really?

574
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:25,772
Speaker 0: Let's talk about terminology here.

575
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,380
Speaker 0: I'm gonna back out from the home routers a bit.

576
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:42,660
Speaker 0: Whenever someone you go to a network class like you think oh there's switches and there's routers and there's hubs, but really those terms just refer to sort of multi-port versions of other more fundamental things.

577
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:49,439
Speaker 0: So if you think about networking the way you think about say electronics, you know, there's an integrated circuit, but then there's a logic gate.

578
00:37:50,787 --> 00:37:55,586
Speaker 0: so our hub is Really just a hub.

579
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:58,400
Speaker 0: it's the same thing as a repeater, but it repeats out multiple ways.

580
00:37:58,762 --> 00:37:59,867
Speaker 0: We don't need to talk about the details.

581
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,280
Speaker 0: beyond that hubs don't exist in the modern world anymore.

582
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:03,460
Speaker 1: No one uses hubs anymore.

583
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,860
Speaker 1: The only place I still see hubs is at land parties that don't have a big budget usually have like these.

584
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:13,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have like these hundred port hubs that they stack up at the end of the table.

585
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,280
Speaker 0: They're all like 10 megabit.

586
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:17,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have 10 or 100 megabit.

587
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,936
Speaker 0: It's got 100 bucks.

588
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:24,720
Speaker 0: You can buy a 54 port 48 gigabit backplane like switch from a gray market, right?

589
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:32,160
Speaker 1: But a lot of these land parties bought this equipment in the olden days and it still works so that they have no reason to Replace it and it actually if you can play land games on a hub like that

590
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:34,408
Speaker 0: No, you really can't with too many computers on them.

591
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:36,254
Speaker 0: It depends not anymore.

592
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:36,816
Speaker 1: They used it.

593
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:37,860
Speaker 1: packs had no problems.

594
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,825
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

595
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:40,352
Speaker 0: are you sure those were hubs?

596
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:42,020
Speaker 1: next time we're at pecs look at the end of the road.

597
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,630
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm just asking if you were sure they were hubs.

598
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,493
Speaker 1: look like hubs to me.

599
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:47,139
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, how?

600
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:47,400
Speaker 0: what?

601
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:50,819
Speaker 0: What does a hub look like compared to a switch?

602
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,608
Speaker 1: You can tell by the blinky lights the way the way they blink is there.

603
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:54,849
Speaker 1: Nope.

604
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:55,170
Speaker 1: Yep.

605
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:55,751
Speaker 1: Nope.

606
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:56,012
Speaker 1: Yep.

607
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:56,935
Speaker 0: Nope.

608
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:57,195
Speaker 0: Yep.

609
00:38:57,697 --> 00:38:58,619
Speaker 0: That is not true.

610
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:11,292
Speaker 0: Anyway, so a repeater, you know in the old days you're sending data Over a wire and say your cables really long.

611
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:12,496
Speaker 0: you put a repeater in the middle.

612
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:13,660
Speaker 1: There's a limit on that length.

613
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,547
Speaker 1: You can't make a cable infinitely long here.

614
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,554
Speaker 0: receives all the data coming in.

615
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:21,160
Speaker 0: now, it's analog electricity But we interpret it as digital.

616
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:29,872
Speaker 0: So there's no loss and we just make new packets a new digital signal coming out the other end Electricity and then it rewrites the same electricity.

617
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:31,257
Speaker 1: So it goes in and not.

618
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:34,139
Speaker 1: well our Lost some power over the wire.

619
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:45,320
Speaker 0: It's a little more subtle than that which is why I want to make the distinction that an amplifier takes the electricity and Kind of regenerates like Chris like adds to it to make it the right electricity again.

620
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:59,528
Speaker 0: Not a whole hub aka a repeater actually reads the signal and does something to interpret it as digital data inside of itself and Basically makes an entirely new signal from scratch.

621
00:39:59,588 --> 00:40:01,473
Speaker 0: Yep, if it didn't do that.

622
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,098
Speaker 0: It's not technically a repeater.

623
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:03,960
Speaker 0: It's an amplifier.

624
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:09,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, well an amplifier might you know amplify too much or not enough because you don't know the exact strength of what's coming.

625
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:12,770
Speaker 0: You need a variable amplifier.

626
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,160
Speaker 0: the problem with an amplifier is that or it also amplifies the noise.

627
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:21,280
Speaker 0: So it doesn't really buy you much with digital communication exactly in this context.

628
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:25,935
Speaker 0: so hub is just a repeater where anything that comes in one part goes off all the other parts.

629
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:40,165
Speaker 0: a switch is Basically a multi-port bridge and all a bridge says is I'm gonna do what a hub does But if I know that the dude a packet was for is not on the other side of this I'm not gonna repeat it.

630
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:44,660
Speaker 0: So all bridges do is limit the amount of traffic on any given network segment.

631
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:47,389
Speaker 1: I thought that the switch is also smart enough to know.

632
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:47,871
Speaker 1: Aha.

633
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:50,680
Speaker 1: I know this is for dude number three on hole three.

634
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,145
Speaker 1: I'm only gonna send it on hole three.

635
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:55,115
Speaker 0: I said a bridge does that.

636
00:40:55,255 --> 00:41:03,266
Speaker 0: a switch is just basically a large multi-port set of bridges That are configurable centrally.

637
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:11,720
Speaker 0: Hmm It says this is a packet that I could repeat everywhere.

638
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,640
Speaker 0: But I'm only gonna repeat it to the places that I know someone actually cares about the data.

639
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,683
Speaker 0: Hmm, so it just.

640
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,433
Speaker 0: it means you have more bandwidth overall than collisions.

641
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:21,155
Speaker 0: forget all that stuff.

642
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,297
Speaker 0: a router Basically is the next step where the it has logic.

643
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:29,966
Speaker 0: beyond that This is where we're not just talking about one networking.

644
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:46,284
Speaker 1: a router at its core connects multiple networks to each other Mm-hmm actual networks, for example your home network to the ISPs network or Google's network to sprints network to Microsoft's network.

645
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,579
Speaker 1: All right, I'll have routers in between right?

646
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,720
Speaker 1: That's why the routers are always at the edge of the network, right?

647
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:56,767
Speaker 1: Even if it's an internal or external network or a sub network The routers are always at the edges.

648
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:58,915
Speaker 1: You never see a router in the middle of a network.

649
00:41:58,955 --> 00:41:59,999
Speaker 1: That doesn't really help you that much.

650
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:01,672
Speaker 0: So what is a network?

651
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:12,109
Speaker 0: Well, we did a whole show on this I think a long time ago, but to super summarize it one set of IP addresses and a subnet mask Which you know cider like.

652
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,960
Speaker 0: if you think of class a class B class C and all that stuff.

653
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,065
Speaker 0: That's really kind of obsolete.

654
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:25,419
Speaker 0: But anyway, or the you know, the 255 255 255 0 What the face I made was pretty great.

655
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:30,440
Speaker 0: one Network is like a set of IP addresses that are all together.

656
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,480
Speaker 0: So in the old days assume there's no network, so I got just a giant hub all my computers connected together.

657
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,634
Speaker 0: So I don't even need IP.

658
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,140
Speaker 0: Nope, all my communication can happen down at layer 2 at the data link level all on one big network.

659
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,559
Speaker 0: I assume anything I put in that network anyone can see if they give a shit about.

660
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,719
Speaker 1: yeah You double-click on network and windows and you see fucking every computer that's plugged into the hub.

661
00:42:53,122 --> 00:43:07,394
Speaker 0: So if you have two separate networks You can basically pretend that anything that's on a different network is a completely alien world and Nothing on your home network has any direct way to talk to anyone over there.

662
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:19,933
Speaker 0: So what a router does is Your your OSI stack, you know your TCP IP stack and I'm skipping all the stuff that isn't relevant to TCP IP Because that doesn't matter to any of you who are listening to this.

663
00:43:19,953 --> 00:43:23,819
Speaker 1: We're using normal everyday computers Which 90% of what they do is TCP IP.

664
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:31,280
Speaker 0: So if I want to send a message from the rim network to the Scott network, my network has its own rules of engagement.

665
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,264
Speaker 0: Let's say I you know My addresses are 10 dot.

666
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:42,680
Speaker 0: so 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 is my computer and 10 dot 50 dot 1 dot 109 to 1 is my NAS, you know, whatever I set up I can do any arbitrary bullshit.

667
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:48,040
Speaker 0: It does not matter at all what Scott's network looks like because he can do whatever he wants on his own.

668
00:43:48,302 --> 00:44:02,779
Speaker 0: He might use the exact same addresses as me Yep, so the router is just a complicated set of logic that can deal with two different networks simultaneously and figure out how to get data between the two.

669
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:05,566
Speaker 0: That is at its core what a router does.

670
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:10,098
Speaker 0: it interfaces networks together thus allowing us to have an internet.

671
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:14,432
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Oh my god, it's a collection of multiple internet works networks.

672
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:15,516
Speaker 0: It's yo-dog.

673
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:16,600
Speaker 1: It's the internet.

674
00:44:17,276 --> 00:44:28,860
Speaker 0: So The way a router does this and then we'll get back to the more interesting stuff that you guys probably care about but it's relevant Because almost no one I talk to especially developers really understands this.

675
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,979
Speaker 1: No, they know how to plug it in.

676
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,060
Speaker 1: They plug the ISP into the big separated hole and they plug all the computers in the other hole.

677
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,673
Speaker 0: So let's assume we have a router and on my network.

678
00:44:37,714 --> 00:44:39,420
Speaker 0: So this router has three interfaces.

679
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:44,700
Speaker 0: It has an interface to some ISP somewhere like internet for internet access.

680
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:50,438
Speaker 0: It has a second port in the rim network and I give it an arbitrary address.

681
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:55,740
Speaker 0: in my network It is the third port in the Scott Network and Scott gave her whatever IP address he wanted as well.

682
00:44:56,664 --> 00:45:04,140
Speaker 0: If I send a packet somewhere, you know, I put an IP address in that packet But I also put some other information in that packet.

683
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:11,580
Speaker 0: So if I'm sending something to a PC on my network I say the IP address of that PC and at the low level some arping happens.

684
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:26,612
Speaker 0: So basically my my computer sends a packet out to my whole network that says yo dog I'm looking for the motherfucker that has IP 10.1.1.1. and whoever has it Gets that data link packet and says yo dog.

685
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:27,215
Speaker 0: That's me.

686
00:45:27,496 --> 00:45:28,560
Speaker 0: Here's my MAC address.

687
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:33,940
Speaker 0: Now you can send shit to me for reals and then everything else I send is directed just at that guy.

688
00:45:34,436 --> 00:45:35,844
Speaker 0: No other people might see it.

689
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:40,838
Speaker 0: the network cards and the switches job is to filter out the stuff that people don't need to see.

690
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,960
Speaker 0: but I say hey, I have this address on my network.

691
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:47,487
Speaker 0: I'm trying to get to someone else who has an IP address.

692
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:50,737
Speaker 0: every computer has two addresses, you know MAC address IP address.

693
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:55,639
Speaker 0: So Whoever has this IP tell me how to get to you on the network.

694
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:59,672
Speaker 0: Those MAC addresses don't need to be unique between networks.

695
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:03,287
Speaker 0: Let's assume that my network and Scott Network We have identical MAC addresses.

696
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:05,459
Speaker 0: MAC addresses never leave the network.

697
00:46:06,283 --> 00:46:16,820
Speaker 0: So if I want to connect to Scott's network, I say with an IP address, yo I'm looking for this IP address Now, let's say well, no one no one on your network has that IP address.

698
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:23,738
Speaker 0: Yeah so no one would respond and there's no way on earth I can find the MAC address of anyone on Scott's network.

699
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,174
Speaker 1: and Even if you could it wouldn't do anything exactly because my router which the fuck is this?

700
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:31,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they might overlap You don't know it's a different network.

701
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:33,800
Speaker 0: I can't just send my networks garbage on the Scott's network.

702
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,342
Speaker 0: That's the whole reason.

703
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:37,411
Speaker 0: we have routers and the internet, you know, someone's MAC.

704
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:39,798
Speaker 0: What's all MAC address of anything at Google?

705
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:40,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

706
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:43,367
Speaker 0: So my computer says yo dawg.

707
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:48,844
Speaker 0: I'm looking for IP address 192 168 69 69.

708
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:49,911
Speaker 0: Well, nobody answers.

709
00:46:49,952 --> 00:46:54,164
Speaker 0: Nobody has that except Someone does answer.

710
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:57,875
Speaker 0: the router says yo dawg.

711
00:46:58,397 --> 00:46:59,280
Speaker 0: I can get you there.

712
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:01,319
Speaker 0: So send that shit over to me.

713
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:07,320
Speaker 1: I thought that sometimes what happens is the router doesn't answer but your computer has configured a default gateway.

714
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:11,777
Speaker 1: Okay, so when no one answers he then says, alright, I'll just ask mr.

715
00:47:11,797 --> 00:47:12,440
Speaker 1: Default gateway.

716
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,000
Speaker 0: So let's get a little more complicated.

717
00:47:14,421 --> 00:47:18,535
Speaker 0: You have a default gateway, which is actually just a route that you've configured on your.

718
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:23,719
Speaker 1: you basically tell your computer Hey computer, the router is at this address.

719
00:47:24,262 --> 00:47:25,246
Speaker 1: That's where router be.

720
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:28,820
Speaker 0: so you can basically you can set up complicated routes on your computer.

721
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:31,958
Speaker 0: So say I have multiple networks, which is this is the coolest ever.

722
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:32,300
Speaker 0: get to the end.

723
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:41,857
Speaker 0: I can say yo computer for any 10-dot address Use this physical interface or this gateway or whatever for these other IPs.

724
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:42,640
Speaker 0: use this other gateway.

725
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,000
Speaker 0: So I could have my internal network and my computer could be connected to three different networks simultaneously.

726
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,359
Speaker 1: I can do all sorts of crazy crap.

727
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:52,380
Speaker 1: Well, maybe you got for example, you're out of college and they got internet one and internet two.

728
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:59,940
Speaker 1: So that router says hey any IPs that you know for internet one go this way any I internet to go that way.

729
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:09,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Basically, yes your computer to skip the details because without drawing a diagram of it You're just gonna ignore me talking until I finish talking about this bit.

730
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:17,400
Speaker 0: Your computer will basically have the default gateway which says yo Anything that's not on your network is over at this guy.

731
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:27,100
Speaker 0: And what the router does is you actually at the data link layer send your packets directly to the router With its MAC address and the router takes care all the earth.

732
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:31,680
Speaker 0: That packet says all right now it acts like a computer.

733
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,540
Speaker 0: So it says it is a computer.

734
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:41,306
Speaker 0: I have a computer on Scott's Network and it said now it follows Scott's rules and says yo guys I'm looking for this IP address.

735
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:47,670
Speaker 0: My MAC address is X. So any messages Scott sends back to me He sends them to the MAC address of the router.

736
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,240
Speaker 0: The router does all the translation and all the bullshit.

737
00:48:51,621 --> 00:48:53,349
Speaker 1: So that is probably his router.

738
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,540
Speaker 1: pie talks to another router which talks to another one.

739
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:01,360
Speaker 1: Another one which talks to mine which talks to the computer on my network which then talks all the way back around.

740
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:10,839
Speaker 1: But really everything only talks to the network that they're on and the only machines that ever talked to more than one network at a time are routers.

741
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:16,096
Speaker 0: Basically, yes now a computer can serve the function of a router.

742
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:17,260
Speaker 1: router is just a computer.

743
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,979
Speaker 1: Yes install IP route on your computer and now your computer is doing routing.

744
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:35,240
Speaker 0: Congratulations, so What other than Connect me to the internet and net and pat, you know Network address translation port address translation all the stuff that your router is doing that You actually don't need to do at the router?

745
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:36,464
Speaker 0: There's other ways to do it.

746
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:39,976
Speaker 0: skip all that other than the basic stuff.

747
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,080
Speaker 0: as in you've got a router.

748
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,106
Speaker 0: It connects you to the internet.

749
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:44,700
Speaker 0: There's actually a lot of cool stuff you can do with your router.

750
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,859
Speaker 0: You should log into its admin interface and take a look.

751
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,344
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, depending on how much money you spent on your router There's more stuff you can do.

752
00:49:51,424 --> 00:50:00,715
Speaker 1: and also maybe you've installed a special firmware such as DDW RT or tomato Onto a crappy router to give it much more functionality that it could have had.

753
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:04,689
Speaker 1: because remember router again Just a computer with a bunch of network cards in it.

754
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:12,216
Speaker 1: So there's no reason it can't do a lot of things Except they may be too CPU intensive and the router will shit itself.

755
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:12,799
Speaker 1: try to do them.

756
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:14,987
Speaker 0: Yep, not a lot of power in there now.

757
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:18,380
Speaker 1: So one thing a lot of routers have wireless access points built in.

758
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,249
Speaker 1: That's pretty obvious.

759
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:26,700
Speaker 0: Yeah now Notice if you set that up, usually what it's actually doing is your wireless has a separate set of IPS.

760
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:28,987
Speaker 0: It's actually a separate network.

761
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,632
Speaker 0: Some routers do that automatically.

762
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:32,960
Speaker 0: Yep, or you know something like that.

763
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,464
Speaker 0: Now you can do clever stuff there.

764
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:38,314
Speaker 0: You can set up your router such that all right.

765
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:40,400
Speaker 0: Anyone can connect to my wireless.

766
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:45,680
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna let that network access my internal network.

767
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,867
Speaker 0: I only route them directly to the internet.

768
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:49,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can have the router right.

769
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,060
Speaker 1: remember the router connects networks together.

770
00:50:52,603 --> 00:51:02,182
Speaker 1: You can tell the router to make multiple networks Like my house has like three networks as a wireless one a wired one and then it has a guest Wireless.

771
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:07,040
Speaker 1: or if anyone connects in the guest wireless like they can't see my nose because it's not on the same network as them.

772
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want people to get on my nose.

773
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:10,880
Speaker 1: They might delete my files.

774
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:11,884
Speaker 0: I did a different.

775
00:51:11,924 --> 00:51:13,270
Speaker 0: I put my security different level.

776
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,720
Speaker 0: My NAS is accessible on my entire internal network.

777
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,485
Speaker 1: But you put security in the NAS itself.

778
00:51:18,706 --> 00:51:29,420
Speaker 0: Yes, the NAS itself is set up to where anyone can get media files off of it But they can't write to it and I actually have a Dropbox or anyone can dump anything but can't read back off of it.

779
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:36,880
Speaker 1: I got all sorts of cool stuff set up there that it was easier for me to just say NAS be Completely accessible drive that way to configure anything.

780
00:51:37,121 --> 00:51:45,780
Speaker 0: The reason I set up the way I did is that a lot of times people come over and say oh Hey, you've got anime X. Can I borrow and I say yeah, just pull it off the NAS and they fail to do so.

781
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:46,783
Speaker 0: No, they succeed.

782
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:49,853
Speaker 0: the people who fail to do so are not the ones.

783
00:51:49,913 --> 00:51:54,451
Speaker 1: I offer that to look how many people still be like trading hard external drives and USB sticks.

784
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:58,866
Speaker 0: and there are reasons for that sometimes Technological.

785
00:51:58,906 --> 00:52:02,084
Speaker 0: if I'm getting like I'm downloading I'm all right.

786
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:04,720
Speaker 0: I am allegedly downloading a target right now.

787
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,141
Speaker 0: You know what?

788
00:52:05,282 --> 00:52:08,693
Speaker 0: It is all of Seinfeld in the HD remaster.

789
00:52:08,713 --> 00:52:09,395
Speaker 0: It's 130 HD remaster of Seinfeld.

790
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:12,112
Speaker 0: It's like a booray release yourself.

791
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:14,764
Speaker 1: Does it have an Removed laugh track.

792
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:15,567
Speaker 0: I don't know.

793
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:17,775
Speaker 0: All I know is it's a hundred and thirty two gigabytes.

794
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:24,260
Speaker 0: Okay, so It might take a little while to transfer that over my wireless to someone's laptop.

795
00:52:24,923 --> 00:52:27,296
Speaker 1: Do they even have a hundred and thirty two gigs exactly?

796
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:27,900
Speaker 0: It might be easy.

797
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,139
Speaker 1: They're gonna have hundred thirty two gigs stick.

798
00:52:30,682 --> 00:52:35,217
Speaker 0: It might just be easier to hand them a small external hard drive with like two terabytes on.

799
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:36,060
Speaker 0: just they bring it back.

800
00:52:36,522 --> 00:52:39,718
Speaker 0: Oh, and it also has all the robot openers and everything else I've ever collected on it.

801
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:41,734
Speaker 0: cuz whatever It's my throwaway external hard drive.

802
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,625
Speaker 0: great Other cool things you can do.

803
00:52:45,147 --> 00:52:47,937
Speaker 0: set up segregated networks for different things.

804
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:55,140
Speaker 0: For example One thing you can do on a router is there's always this option called the DMZ the demilitarized zone.

805
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:57,308
Speaker 0: Sounds cool.

806
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:00,524
Speaker 1: Most people ignore it sounds really cool But only really weird.

807
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:01,125
Speaker 1: people use it.

808
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,269
Speaker 0: what it basically means.

809
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:15,020
Speaker 0: you can have one computer that is on the outside of your router So that people if they connect to your external IP address, whatever it might be That computer is basically what they hit.

810
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:19,179
Speaker 1: Yeah Right now somebody tries to connect to whatever IP address my ISP gave me.

811
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:23,220
Speaker 1: They're gonna hit the router itself and maybe the router will do something and maybe it won't.

812
00:53:23,762 --> 00:53:29,104
Speaker 0: Usually your router is set to not let anything through unless it's part of an existing connection Exactly.

813
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:32,120
Speaker 0: So because you don't want some jackass just SSHing into your box.

814
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:35,860
Speaker 1: If I put a computer and I plug it into the router that's gonna be on the inside.

815
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,885
Speaker 1: It's gonna be on my network.

816
00:53:36,905 --> 00:53:39,919
Speaker 1: But if I click on the router, I say hey make that computer DMZ.

817
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:48,060
Speaker 1: It's gonna be as if that Computer is actually between the router and the internet or sort of next to the router on the other side.

818
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:55,495
Speaker 1: So I could put you know a web server on there and if someone visits my IP address Of my house in their browser, they'll see a web page.

819
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:56,420
Speaker 1: It comes from that computer.

820
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:02,712
Speaker 1: I could put a counter-strike server on there and then I won't need to fuck around with the port forwarding nonsense It'll just freakin work.

821
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:05,683
Speaker 0: Yeah Another cool thing you can do that I haven't.

822
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:09,920
Speaker 0: I'm actually working on setting this up now a lot of modern routers.

823
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:14,100
Speaker 0: You can set them up to receive VPN connections.

824
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:29,240
Speaker 0: So then if you have a laptop with some VPN software or you set up your phone your smartphone with certain VPN software And you use something like dyne DNS So you have an external DNS name that maps to whatever bullshit IP your ISP gives you that might change.

825
00:54:29,965 --> 00:54:35,933
Speaker 0: You can just be like boop and have a direct VPN that's secure and encrypted to your own personal internal network.

826
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:38,360
Speaker 0: to like our desktop on your PC or pull something off your NAS.

827
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:40,814
Speaker 0: Yep, how totally useful is that?

828
00:54:41,136 --> 00:54:41,780
Speaker 1: super useful?

829
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:47,100
Speaker 1: The kind of person to keep stuff in your house Right now what a lot of people do because that's such a pain in the ass.

830
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,268
Speaker 0: They use like go to media not go to meeting.

831
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:53,905
Speaker 0: they use like use all sorts of cloud go to or they use like go To my PC or those janky.

832
00:54:53,945 --> 00:54:58,935
Speaker 1: Well, not just that but like they use Dropbox and all these other sorts of cloud services Right where it's like.

833
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:04,500
Speaker 1: hey I can't send the files directly to the computer in my house or get them from the computer in my house while I'm at Starbucks.

834
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:11,973
Speaker 1: So what I'll do is I'll pay someone else who has computers out in the cloud on the internet Right that aren't behind routers.

835
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:15,960
Speaker 1: Yeah all locked up I'll upload files there go home and download the files.

836
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,440
Speaker 0: You have a computer that's already on the internet.

837
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:27,400
Speaker 1: Why can't you send them directly from your laptop to your house and back and forth because you have this router in the way That's not doing fancy things for you because you didn't configure it because it's not that easy.

838
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,100
Speaker 0: Now the use case is this for example, I use Google Drive for that like my laptops and everything.

839
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,051
Speaker 0: Yep, all just you know, I have access to all my Google Drive stuff everywhere.

840
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:37,300
Speaker 0: But you know what that's only five or ten gigs.

841
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:37,762
Speaker 0: I'm not.

842
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:39,570
Speaker 0: it's not everything.

843
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,920
Speaker 0: That's the stuff that I know I want to back up and share.

844
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:50,160
Speaker 0: But what if say I'm on vacation and oh shit the Dave and Joel fast karate for the gentleman episode didn't upload, right?

845
00:55:50,902 --> 00:55:52,875
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't put that on my Google Drive.

846
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:58,234
Speaker 0: Nope Well, if I don't have a VPN back to my house, there's literally no way to do anything about that.

847
00:55:58,636 --> 00:56:01,658
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm that actually happened many years ago.

848
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:05,433
Speaker 0: So we had to wait an extra week until we got home from our week at the shore.

849
00:56:05,553 --> 00:56:10,899
Speaker 0: our writers retreat after Otacon to Put up the fantastic episode of geek nights that Dave and Joel did for us.

850
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:18,316
Speaker 0: Had I set up a VPN on the home router I could just logged in Sent a wake on ethernet to wake up my PC and just done it.

851
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:22,252
Speaker 0: Yep What other cool things could we do that you guys would actually do?

852
00:56:22,272 --> 00:56:25,491
Speaker 0: because there's crazy stuff you can do that You probably shouldn't do.

853
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:26,599
Speaker 1: it shouldn't do.

854
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:30,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, like don't unless you know what you're doing.

855
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,576
Speaker 0: Don't fuck with your DHCP setting.

856
00:56:32,596 --> 00:56:35,183
Speaker 0: You're just gonna break everything You know.

857
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:46,900
Speaker 0: one DHCP thing you should do actually is if you're having your router do your DHCP which most people do You probably shouldn't just because routers kind of suck at that and have problems sometimes.

858
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:51,540
Speaker 0: But at the same time you can only get off of the router if you have another PC in your house.

859
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:53,306
Speaker 0: That isn't your actual PC.

860
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,478
Speaker 0: that is guaranteed to always always always always always beyond.

861
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:05,273
Speaker 0: Yep But then you can set up your DHCP to pass Google DNS to all your internal PCs instead of your ISP.

862
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:06,457
Speaker 0: is garbage DNA, right?

863
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:12,300
Speaker 1: or what you have to do Otherwise is go to each and every PC in your house and change the DNS settings to use the Google public.

864
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,429
Speaker 0: The whole point of computers is to make that stuff easy.

865
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:14,870
Speaker 0: Did?

866
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:22,677
Speaker 0: the whole point of DHCP is you don't have to configure anything Your computer or you can set up a computer that's always on that is a DNS server and have that.

867
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:29,329
Speaker 1: use the Google DNS And all the computers in your house use that but then you have to tell your DHCP Server to tell all your computers to use.

868
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:30,092
Speaker 0: that is the deal.

869
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:31,357
Speaker 1: You already have a computer.

870
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:36,987
Speaker 1: That's the computer That's always on doing the DNS To turn off its DHCP.

871
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:40,840
Speaker 0: because let me tell you son you got two DHCPs on your network.

872
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:42,032
Speaker 0: It's a bad day.

873
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:49,710
Speaker 0: bad day especially because the kinds of people who will let two DHCP servers be on their network are not the kinds of people who know how To recognize that.

874
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:50,439
Speaker 0: that's the problem.

875
00:57:50,721 --> 00:58:09,888
Speaker 1: And if you have a DHCP server either in your router or separate from your router You can go to it and say hey look see the mat see this computer That's connected to you right now make that IP address on that computer 192 168 110 and make it always 110. so your desktop will always have the same internal IP all the time Which makes it really easy.

876
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:12,944
Speaker 1: if like you connect between your computers a lot It's like you won't be like.

877
00:58:12,964 --> 00:58:13,988
Speaker 1: where'd my NAS go?

878
00:58:14,048 --> 00:58:19,954
Speaker 1: it moved from 15 to 17. well shit if you can make it So it's always 15 all the time no matter what.

879
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:22,359
Speaker 0: yep now I actually didn't bother with that.

880
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:29,420
Speaker 0: But that's partly because since I'm on a one network my NAS and everything just show up because everything's kind of broadcast.

881
00:58:29,701 --> 00:58:32,950
Speaker 1: Well, they're using like the windows stuff.

882
00:58:33,772 --> 00:58:34,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the?

883
00:58:34,354 --> 00:58:35,677
Speaker 1: what's the frickin Apple Apple?

884
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,367
Speaker 1: Bonjour uses that.

885
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:43,888
Speaker 1: yeah, whatever Apple yeah Another really cool.

886
00:58:43,928 --> 00:58:45,998
Speaker 0: I don't need to run a win server anymore.

887
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:49,975
Speaker 1: something That's incredibly useful if you have a lot of people use on your network.

888
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:50,578
Speaker 1: right.

889
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:57,120
Speaker 1: especially Untrustworthy of evil is to use QoS which is called stands for quality of service.

890
00:58:57,221 --> 00:59:00,320
Speaker 1: But really what it means is you fucking choke a bitch.

891
00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:05,720
Speaker 0: I log into my router and I can see you know like Scott's a laptop because he's on the network.

892
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,450
Speaker 0: I can log in right now, and it gets his host name.

893
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:13,067
Speaker 0: it gives him IP and I can see oh, that's Scott's laptop That's the IP and I know his MAC address.

894
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:14,632
Speaker 0: I could set it up to where.

895
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:19,147
Speaker 0: hey anytime that fucking MAC address connects Only give him five megabit.

896
00:59:19,448 --> 00:59:21,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can make sure don't let him torrents.

897
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:30,876
Speaker 1: well Yeah you can regulate people's bandwidth and set rules based on which computer and Also based on time of day and all sorts of other factors.

898
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:37,540
Speaker 0: have your router Automatically throttle down your torrents when you're home and let him go nuts when you're at work?

899
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:44,700
Speaker 1: Yep, so you can just leave your torrents running all the time and the router automatically forced the torrents to all be like one megabit.

900
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:49,295
Speaker 1: You know whatever when during hours when you would be at home and let it be.

901
00:59:49,656 --> 00:59:51,441
Speaker 1: use up all the bandwidth when you're not at Home.

902
00:59:51,461 --> 00:59:57,200
Speaker 1: or maybe you've got a neighbor that's stealing your Wi-Fi, but you want to let them steal your Wi-Fi for some reason.

903
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,272
Speaker 1: Maybe they're paying you to share something because they're lazy.

904
01:00:00,332 --> 01:00:00,653
Speaker 1: I don't know.

905
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:01,396
Speaker 1: maybe you're just.

906
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:02,380
Speaker 1: I wouldn't recommend it.

907
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,935
Speaker 1: I say get your own ISP and don't let anyone else use it.

908
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:08,639
Speaker 0: now There's a very good reason why you let all your neighbors use it.

909
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,726
Speaker 1: Plausible deniability.

910
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:13,320
Speaker 1: you better of using your neighbors or pause not had to be ability.

911
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,969
Speaker 0: They don't know a combination of the two.

912
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:28,426
Speaker 0: you do your legal shit on theirs And if they do anything on yours, or if you accidentally do anything on yours I don't know much, but anyway You can say limit neighbors to 500 K So they can't really do anything nasty.

913
01:00:28,948 --> 01:00:30,673
Speaker 0: or if you want to do crazy stuff.

914
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,000
Speaker 0: so say you get a VPN like I predator.

915
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:38,660
Speaker 0: Right yeah, so you can put that in your router and set up a routing table.

916
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:43,514
Speaker 0: You could do something like this something so cool and clever, and it'll all be automatic.

917
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:49,453
Speaker 0: every time you start up a torrent It just automatically goes through I predator.

918
01:00:49,794 --> 01:00:51,760
Speaker 0: hmm, but nothing else goes through I predator.

919
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:58,700
Speaker 0: Yep Or you can set it up to where every time I'm connecting to my illegal offshore bank account to finance the barge.

920
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,480
Speaker 0: It knows all those routes go through I predator.

921
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:06,240
Speaker 0: So you can still do your normal stuff on your computer and you can set up routes for all these different connections.

922
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:12,620
Speaker 1: Usually when you pay for one of those VPN services like I predator you can only have one computer attached to it at a time.

923
01:01:13,062 --> 01:01:22,300
Speaker 1: So if I were to attach to it would say my desktop well my laptop and my phone Which is still in my house would not be able to send their traffic over it to Sweden before they send it to the internet.

924
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:25,372
Speaker 1: But if I have my router connect to I predator well not.

925
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:30,820
Speaker 1: all the internet traffic in my house Could be encrypted and sent to Sweden and anonymized before it's sent to the internet.

926
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:36,398
Speaker 0: Or I could set it to where the only traffic that gets sent over I predator is my burner laptop That doesn't have a hard disk in it.

927
01:01:38,514 --> 01:01:42,492
Speaker 0: You know that Burner laptop guys if you're gonna commit crimes.

928
01:01:42,553 --> 01:01:43,900
Speaker 0: This is the crime aside.

929
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:45,153
Speaker 0: We should make that a bit in geek night.

930
01:01:45,173 --> 01:01:48,570
Speaker 1: crime aside Get it get it commit crimes and get away with it by geek night.

931
01:01:48,611 --> 01:01:52,006
Speaker 0: get a cheapo laptop with an optical drive Though a USB.

932
01:01:52,026 --> 01:01:52,830
Speaker 0: you could do with USB.

933
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:54,419
Speaker 1: now don't put any hard drives in it.

934
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:58,557
Speaker 0: No hard drives optical drive only optical drive and as much RAM as you can.

935
01:01:58,618 --> 01:01:59,140
Speaker 0: fit in that motherfucker.

936
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:04,339
Speaker 0: Boot a Linux live CD and hibernate it, but never turn it off.

937
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:06,355
Speaker 1: Yeah and remove the Linux live CD.

938
01:02:06,658 --> 01:02:11,053
Speaker 1: then Install you know download and install whatever illegal things you have to install from the internet.

939
01:02:11,113 --> 01:02:12,899
Speaker 1: configure them while the laptop is on.

940
01:02:13,581 --> 01:02:17,497
Speaker 1: Attach the laptop to some wireless network in a Starbucks or something.

941
01:02:17,557 --> 01:02:20,829
Speaker 1: hide it somewhere Plugged into power or keep it in your house.

942
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,700
Speaker 0: set up to route through I predator and do all your evil shit there.

943
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:24,386
Speaker 1: Yeah, have it.

944
01:02:24,426 --> 01:02:27,804
Speaker 1: Well I predators maybe not that secure Inequivalent of I pray.

945
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:31,320
Speaker 1: yeah, but the point is you know just have this laptop doing all this evil shit.

946
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:44,180
Speaker 1: And if the police ever find it or the FBI ever come for it and they confiscate it cuz that's what they do They're gonna unplug it or whatever or maybe they'll try to turn it on and look at it, and it's like okay They can't really log into it, so what is their usual game plan?

947
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:53,693
Speaker 1: They take the hard drive out and they examine it and if it's an encrypted hard drive well You know they can try But if there is no hard drive, then what the fuck did they do?

948
01:02:53,713 --> 01:02:54,637
Speaker 1: they just turned it off.

949
01:02:54,757 --> 01:02:55,360
Speaker 1: all the evidence.

950
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,839
Speaker 0: now There are basic ways to deal with that.

951
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,316
Speaker 1: But you can run that is you can put the RAM in the freezer really quick.

952
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:08,480
Speaker 0: in the time Between when they beat down my door, and they get to my room I can probably pull the plug on the laptop yep, and then you want to be extra paranoid.

953
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,990
Speaker 0: There's no battery in there either.

954
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:16,733
Speaker 1: if it's the kind of laptop that'll run with that Just unplug it and there's no battery in it and boom everything's toast.

955
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:18,037
Speaker 0: and that was the gig night's.

956
01:03:18,137 --> 01:03:19,804
Speaker 0: crime aside That's right.

957
01:03:19,844 --> 01:03:21,652
Speaker 1: They can't scan a hard drive if there isn't one.

958
01:03:22,155 --> 01:03:23,240
Speaker 1: Oh, no you found the CD.

959
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:27,100
Speaker 0: That is a Linux live CD, so what's the moral of all this you know?

960
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,890
Speaker 0: What routers do now which is basically anything a computer can do?

961
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:36,740
Speaker 0: Log into the admin interface of whatever your router is and look at what options you have and think to yourself.

962
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:45,146
Speaker 0: Normally we say come up with something you want to do and then look up how to do it But in this case my homework for all that you didn't know you could do.

963
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:46,569
Speaker 1: that you probably do want to do.

964
01:03:46,609 --> 01:03:47,090
Speaker 1: you just don't.

965
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:55,341
Speaker 0: So if you want to learn about networking computers everything just log into your router look at all the options and think all right What can I do with that option?

966
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:56,650
Speaker 1: also if you have a cheap router?

967
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,738
Speaker 1: You're probably not gonna have the options right.

968
01:03:58,899 --> 01:04:06,190
Speaker 1: I have the net gear WNDR 3700 which is a really expensive and fancy router that does all sorts of fancy shit.

969
01:04:06,412 --> 01:04:07,682
Speaker 0: I have the shitty files router.

970
01:04:07,702 --> 01:04:11,683
Speaker 0: this is actually pretty good But I got to buy another router to put between it and my network.

971
01:04:12,346 --> 01:04:14,529
Speaker 1: you do do yeah You should do that.

972
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:23,170
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

973
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:26,842
