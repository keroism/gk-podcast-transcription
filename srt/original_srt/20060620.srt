00:00:58,236 --> 00:00:59,060
Speaker 1: That's why it sucks.

18
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,051

46
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:35,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, those have been a distinct drought of board games lately mostly due to the fact that we haven't had much time to play them Since it's con season, but this weekend is crazy board gaming weekend.

00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:53,320
Speaker 1: I know me either, but I might just buy something kind of mediocre or average or slightly above.

54
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,135

Speaker 0: Oh, really?

71
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:51,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the guy's name?

72
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:56,240
Speaker 0: Hold on Hold on I can't edit anything out because we're using garage band.

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you just keep talking while I find this guy's name about frapper.

74
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:11,172
Speaker 0: All right Well, we got a frapper map which is basically this cool little integrated with Google Maps thing where anyone who wants to can join the front row crew geek nights pepper map and Put a little dot on the map so you can see where all our listeners are.

75
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:20,343
Speaker 0: and you might be surprised You know being meant that many of you are probably Americans that we have a lot of overseas and foreign listeners Which I think is awesome.

76
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:24,977
Speaker 0: We seem to be particularly popular in Australia and the UK.

77
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:25,660
Speaker 1: kind of yep.

78
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:28,119
Speaker 1: What else is there?

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:43,297
Speaker 1: Oh if you send us feedback in the form of audio meaning you attach an mp3 to an email or something or If you just send us an email to geek nights at front row crew calm Then we will most likely talk about it in the show or something.

80
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,360
Speaker 0: now We often talk about non audio feedback we get but we really don't attribute it or anything because it wasn't audio.

81
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,446
Speaker 0: So what do you want us to do?

82
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:53,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, the forums are also good.

83
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, our forums are pretty rockin actually surprisingly.

84
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,700
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and that's what this show is all about.

85
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:00,907
Speaker 1: Right pretty much everything we covered.

86
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:06,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay the PayPal guy some awesome person Seems to be a Chinese person.

87
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,052
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing by the name.

88
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,259
Speaker 1: So if I'm wrong, oh, I'm sorry.

89
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:13,310
Speaker 1: Named Bey way Chang.

90
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:14,655
Speaker 1: I think I got that right.

91
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:15,859
Speaker 1: sent us.

92
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,363
Speaker 1: You're awesome.

93
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though we distinctly asked everyone not to send us money.

94
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,880
Speaker 0: We're not going to turn away money.

95
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is we.

96
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,930
Speaker 1: I put a PayPal on the site because you know It's more expensive for us to do the podcast now.

97
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:37,135
Speaker 1: Well and because that one listener asked us to Yeah, and the thing is is I don't want to ask for money.

98
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,100
Speaker 1: I don't need money.

99
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,525
Speaker 1: I don't want money.

100
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:41,032
Speaker 1: if no one sent me money.

101
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,016
Speaker 1: I'd be perfectly happy.

102
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:50,808
Speaker 1: but People out there want they're like trying to put money into my pocket and you know I really you know, you've only.

103
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,500
Speaker 1: you have to say no three times and then you have to let them put it there.

104
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,564
Speaker 1: That's that's the rule.

105
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:58,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of like that rule of how many times a boy is allowed to break a promise.

106
00:05:58,511 --> 00:06:10,800
Speaker 1: Yep So there's a PayPal hidden in the bottom right corner of our main site hidden down there and you know People can give us money if they are incredibly compelled, but we will not ask for it.

107
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,535
Speaker 0: In fact, if someone said yeah, we won't ask for it yet.

108
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:14,340
Speaker 0: You keep bringing it up.

109
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:18,920
Speaker 1: If someone came to me and said I want to give you PayPal money I'd say don't give it to me now.

110
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:35,275
Speaker 0: I will tell you right now that if you're thinking about giving us PayPal money hold off and wait because now that our logo contest and everything is mostly finalized if If you want to give us money, you'd be better off giving the company We're gonna contract to make awesome geek night swag giving them the money.

111
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:36,480
Speaker 0: We won't see any of it.

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,607
Speaker 0: Then you get swag swag.

113
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,353
Speaker 0: We'd rather you head of nothing.

114
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,340
Speaker 0: We'd rather you have swag than us have money.

115
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,346
Speaker 0: Yep, so stay tuned for the t-shirts.

116
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:59,235
Speaker 1: We've actually got a really good really relevant to today's show t-shirt but if you do want to get mad props on the show then giving us money is a good way to do that as Bayway Chang has evidenced.

117
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,787
Speaker 0: Yeah Great.

118
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:02,199
Speaker 0: So you've just told everyone we can be bought.

119
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:09,039
Speaker 1: No We're gonna say your name we're not gonna pimp your company or your website or anything like that.

120
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:23,958
Speaker 0: Yeah Though I do have to give an awesome shout out to James and Lisa good friends of ours who recently well not recently was actually a while ago moved to Texas and I've got this new Mac Mini and tomorrow we're going to be interviewing the con chair of Otacon.

121
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:24,258
Speaker 0: Mr.

122
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:24,800
Speaker 0: Jim Vowles.

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,620
Speaker 0: He was an awesome man And his cousin Jim consonants.

124
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,171
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I'll bet no one's ever made that joke to him.

125
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:33,939
Speaker 1: Maybe I should make it to him.

126
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:43,808
Speaker 0: But we decided to do the interview over iChat because it as apparently this nice GarageBand interface even though I hate GarageBand But I won't get into that today because it's not that day.

127
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,858
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can listen to yesterday's podcast for all that shit.

128
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:53,280
Speaker 0: Yeah But I had to test it because I can't really test it without opening an actual conversation.

129
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:59,160
Speaker 0: So I looked and you know, not many of the people we know have Macs and far fewer of them use iChat.

130
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:06,740
Speaker 0: So James and Lisa were gracious enough to turn on their Macs and their iChats and talk to me and I recorded it.

131
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,637
Speaker 0: Thus I was able to prove that it works and now I learned everything about it.

132
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,084
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Cool.

133
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:13,612
Speaker 1: Yeah news time.

134
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,080
Speaker 0: I think it's news time.

135
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:19,620
Speaker 0: We'll go with yours first since yours is actually video game news and mine is just piss you off news.

136
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:21,849
Speaker 1: Great piss me off news girl.

137
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,215
Speaker 0: I'm real good at piss you off news.

138
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,440
Speaker 1: Well, here you go ready.

139
00:08:24,662 --> 00:08:26,520
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read it straight from the website.

140
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:39,240
Speaker 1: In a bid to steal Sony's thunder Microsoft is rumored to be slashing the 360s price tag by almost a hundred dollars whoa sometime around autumn of 2006.

141
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,861
Speaker 1: Microsoft.

142
00:08:39,942 --> 00:09:00,139
Speaker 1: maybe they'll redesign the system or you know with better cheaper hardware or something and They'll bring the core system down to Currently $300 and will be cheaper than the Wii and the pros super complete Xbox 360 would be slightly more than the Wii.

143
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,788
Speaker 1: And this is this isn't for sure.

144
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,514
Speaker 1: This is an industry.

145
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,180
Speaker 1: It's not even like a rumor.

146
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:09,816
Speaker 1: It says rumor, but it's like it's like a good guess.

147
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,388
Speaker 0: now I'll point out one that we won't talk about.

148
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,552
Speaker 0: Let's not take Nintendo right away.

149
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:17,360
Speaker 0: Let's just compare this to what's going on with Sony.

150
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:23,980
Speaker 0: I'd say that that's another nail in Sony's coffin because there are a lot of nails hanging around lately, but it doesn't matter.

151
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,586
Speaker 1: You can't go beyond the maximum.

152
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:29,160
Speaker 1: It's oh when the nail is driven all the way into the wood hitting it more.

153
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,024
Speaker 1: It doesn't do anything.

154
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:35,532
Speaker 0: I guess what I want to say is that if this is true There is just a giant nail buried in the ground.

155
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:36,255
Speaker 0: There's no coffin.

156
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,785
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

157
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:44,202
Speaker 0: the Xbox 360 which in as far as the I mean forget what you know about the Technology.

158
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,029
Speaker 0: the vast majority of people don't.

159
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,205
Speaker 0: they know that Xbox is hardcore gaming and PlayStation is hardcore gaming.

160
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:55,880
Speaker 0: I think the vast majority of people equate the two in terms of power and performance and everything.

161
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:14,984
Speaker 0: now if some mom wants to buy a video game system for Johnny for Christmas and The two hardcore gaming systems that are as far as she's concerned identical One of them is $600 and one of them is Hmm, huh?

162
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:15,184
Speaker 0: Cuz

163
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:28,494
Speaker 1: I mean right now it's like okay the Wii was 250 the super Xbox Which pretty much it seems to be the opinion of most people that the core Xbox the cheap one is basically worthless and you need the good one that cost more

164
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,280
Speaker 0: kind of like the Mac mini solo

165
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,537
Speaker 1: Kind of like the Mac mini course.

166
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:36,165
Speaker 1: Oh, yes So it's right now.

167
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:42,003
Speaker 1: It's Wii 250 Xbox 400 PlayStation 3 600.

168
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,802
Speaker 1: What if it was Wii 250?

169
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:50,513
Speaker 1: Xbox 360 300 so only $50 more than the incredibly cheap Wii.

170
00:10:50,954 --> 00:11:09,094
Speaker 1: So it's a Wii plus a game and PlayStation 3 600. now the gap between the 360 and a PlayStation 2. a PlayStation 3 will be two Xboxes in price or Slightly less than two Xboxes in price.

171
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,619
Speaker 0: that's Ridiculous, I don't even know what to say.

172
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,132
Speaker 1: I mean back in the day when you had to choose between an SNES and a Genesis.

173
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:22,064
Speaker 1: a Genesis was cheaper by me at 50 bucks usually, you know and It didn't really matter.

174
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:26,700
Speaker 1: But if the Genesis was half the price of the Super Nintendo, that would have been insane.

175
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:28,850
Speaker 0: Now it's like huh.

176
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:32,085
Speaker 0: in terms of Nintendo there are two ways to look at it.

177
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:41,035
Speaker 0: either you could say that now that the Xbox is so cheap and Especially considering that normal people really equate the Xbox brand with hardcore gaming.

178
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:47,175
Speaker 0: It might put a dent in Wii sales But at the same time it might just make people more inclined to buy both.

179
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:55,999
Speaker 0: because you only need one of the Xbox 360 in the PlayStation 3 There are very few games that you can't play on one.

180
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:59,678
Speaker 1: there were many many surveys that were like, what are you going to get?

181
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:07,920
Speaker 1: and When you looked at the numbers, it seemed like even though very, you know people getting just a Wii wasn't super many.

182
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:11,803
Speaker 1: Of course only super gamers are voting, of course Yeah except slash dot.

183
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:20,396
Speaker 1: when you took into account the number of people who are buying something else and a Wii and you Combined it all it ended up where more than half the gamers had.

184
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:27,213
Speaker 1: we wanted wheeze You know, they just more than half of those guys also wanted something else in addition.

185
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,757
Speaker 0: so stay tuned.

186
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:32,960
Speaker 0: if this is true We'll talk about it again because there are far-reaching ramifications.

187
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,229
Speaker 1: Possibly buying an Xbox 360.

188
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:37,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's so cheap.

189
00:12:37,253 --> 00:12:38,237
Speaker 1: It's hard to say no man.

190
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,100
Speaker 0: What's going on with us?

191
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,184
Speaker 0: I bought a Mac.

192
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:42,094
Speaker 0: now we're thinking of buying an Xbox.

193
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:43,220
Speaker 1: I don't know.

194
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,522
Speaker 0: You know what?

195
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,709
Speaker 0: It's like remember way back.

196
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:53,575
Speaker 0: I switched from gen 2 to Ubuntu Ubuntu When the Xbox came out the first Xbox and everyone made fun of it.

197
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:57,457
Speaker 0: In fact penny arcade Ruthlessly made fun of it.

198
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,663
Speaker 1: Giant controllers.

199
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:05,579
Speaker 1: Hey did like eight comics about how terrible the Xbox was all the while game was becoming the master of mecha salt.

200
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:07,384
Speaker 0: Fast forward to today.

201
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:08,788
Speaker 0: They're freaking Xbox gamers.

202
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:09,309
Speaker 0: They love it.

203
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, they complain about it.

204
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:15,003
Speaker 0: But every gamer complains about every game they play They do.

205
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what they do.

206
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,095
Speaker 0: And that's what this is.

207
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:20,366
Speaker 1: That's what this is All.

208
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,319
Speaker 0: right now to the piss you off news.

209
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:32,889
Speaker 0: Now I was going to talk about Scientologists because I really don't like Scientologists, but there's another Pseudo-religious group that has the word science in it.

210
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:40,334
Speaker 0: that in many ways bothers me more Mainly because Scientology for the most part harms adults.

211
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:50,339
Speaker 0: it harms adults and families But it harms people who while I feel sorry for them and I think we should help them They kind of bring it on themselves by joining this crazy group.

212
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,940
Speaker 0: Christian scientists harm children and that's not cool.

213
00:13:55,802 --> 00:14:06,588
Speaker 0: now to gloss over a lot of the details many Christian scientists don't believe in such things as Immunization or going to the doctor.

214
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:08,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, just remember Christian scientists.

215
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:20,673
Speaker 1: when someone says Christian scientists They don't mean a person who is a scientist who also happens to be a Christian which would be an awesome thing and they don't Scientologists which is something very different than a Christian scientist.

216
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:46,473
Speaker 0: Christian scientists are Generally a God will save you if you're sick And there have been so many court cases where a family will have a child and the child gets sick and they won't take the Child to the doctor because it's against their faith and then the child dies or sometimes the state will sue and take the child away from them to give the child treatment and then the parents will kidnap the Child run to Mexico and then the child will die.

217
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:47,620
Speaker 0: that happened recently.

218
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:53,531
Speaker 0: now Science, I guess has won a round in that.

219
00:14:53,611 --> 00:15:00,019
Speaker 0: in Boston just now there is a minor measles outbreak in a Christian science group.

220
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,480
Speaker 0: Measles measles is the disease that does not really exist in the civilized world anymore.

221
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,046
Speaker 0: We eradicated it.

222
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:23,959
Speaker 0: we through science technology and a concerted effort of mankind Practically eliminated a horrible disease similar to what we did with polio or typhus or What we almost did to malaria before Greenpeace got involved, but I won't talk about that today.

223
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:25,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pet.

224
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,034
Speaker 1: that reminds me.

225
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:36,097
Speaker 1: on Penn show today He was talking about genetic engineering But there was a relevant bit at the end where he talked about a t-shirt his friend has that says God wants you dead or God wants to kill you.

226
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,718
Speaker 1: He goes without science or any medicine or anything like that.

227
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:52,608
Speaker 1: Half of babies just die and half of mothers who make babies will die and Everyone else will die before the age of 30 most likely.

228
00:15:52,628 --> 00:16:02,751
Speaker 1: I think the average life expectancy of a non science human is like 27 28. yeah, so Science is what lets you live.

229
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,579
Speaker 1: God will kill you.

230
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:07,367
Speaker 1: Don't be a Christian scientist.

231
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:08,832
Speaker 1: Christian science doesn't work.

232
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 1: only real science will let you live now.

233
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,542
Speaker 0: Don't get confused.

234
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:15,152
Speaker 0: I'm not attacking faith religion Christianity not today.

235
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:15,513
Speaker 1: Anyway.

236
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,860
Speaker 0: I'm attacking Christian science today.

237
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:20,820
Speaker 0: I want to bring this up mainly because the issue here was vaccinations.

238
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:30,217
Speaker 0: These parents decide did not want to vaccinate their child with the MMR the measles mumps rubella Vaccine which every child in this country gets now.

239
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:30,840
Speaker 0: there are a lot of reason.

240
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,520
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people who object to this vaccine for non religious reasons, which is just as stupid and just as dangerous.

241
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:43,740
Speaker 0: It so happens that many vaccines use a compound that has mercury in it to stabilize them or to preserve them.

242
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:55,251
Speaker 1: Now if you tell some idiot on the street They know that mercury is poisonous and you tell them that vaccine has mercury in it So they put two and two together and they say it's poison.

243
00:16:55,632 --> 00:17:09,694
Speaker 0: even worse a couple of crackpots a while ago Brought forth some evidence that has mostly been discredited saying that Autism looks like it is caused in many cases by Vaccines and the mercury in vaccines, which is just not true.

244
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:10,700
Speaker 1: not true at all.

245
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,896
Speaker 0: It's it's definitely a genetic type of thing and or I mean there could be environmental.

246
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:15,920
Speaker 0: We really don't know.

247
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,325
Speaker 0: We know there are genetic factors.

248
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:21,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there is no substantial evidence that vaccines have anything to do with it.

249
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:30,913
Speaker 0: and Furthermore I would argue that even if they did the net benefit to mankind of vaccinating every child is You know good of the many.

250
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:31,820
Speaker 0: it's a greater good.

251
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:41,475
Speaker 0: You'll save far more people from far worse fates by vaccinating everyone if 0.01 percent of the people vaccinated develop Autism, even though that doesn't actually happen.

252
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:46,559
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I just wanted to make the intellectual argument here in case anyone, you know decided to argue against it.

253
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,150
Speaker 1: Yep, you know my argument against vaccines is they hurt.

254
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:51,334
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

255
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:51,996
Speaker 0: you're a little baby.

256
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:53,260
Speaker 0: You don't know it hurts.

257
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:57,500
Speaker 0: Actually, I've gotten many interesting vaccines in my adult life.

258
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:58,303
Speaker 1: It doesn't hurt.

259
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,870
Speaker 1: Let me give you all kinds of shots then.

260
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,412
Speaker 0: Uh, Scott you realize that while I was young I had allergy shots for over eight years where twice a week.

261
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:07,580
Speaker 0: I would go in and get two shots in each arm.

262
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:08,745
Speaker 0: Shots don't hurt.

263
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:10,252
Speaker 0: I just they don't even bother me at all.

264
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:14,039
Speaker 0: All right, then I'll give you some Only if they do something useful for me.

265
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:19,280
Speaker 0: I mean I while ago I got the hepatitis vaccine and the meningitis vaccine cuz I work in hospital.

266
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,770
Speaker 1: All right, I'll put something in the shots.

267
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,294
Speaker 1: I'll put in.

268
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:24,176
Speaker 1: Um, yeah Heroin heroin will work.

269
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:27,404
Speaker 1: You Like everyone right?

270
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:29,830
Speaker 0: Yeah heroines just great perfect.

271
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,034
Speaker 1: We'll go we'll get to that.

272
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:33,320
Speaker 0: I just I saw this news.

273
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:40,930
Speaker 0: I was gonna talk about something stupid thing and then I saw this news about a measles outbreak in the United States And I just couldn't let that stand.

274
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:41,936
Speaker 0: I had to say something about it.

275
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:53,539
Speaker 0: But happily that music means that it's time for things of the day.

276
00:18:54,182 --> 00:19:04,380
Speaker 1: Yes, if you're a new listener every episode we do the things of the day Which is where we pick a thing from the internet that we think is humorous interesting, etc.

277
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:09,200
Speaker 1: And the link to it is on the website in the show notes.

278
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:14,320
Speaker 0: Yep, or many people apparently just look at my delicious because I usually put in there what I'm gonna link to.

279
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine is in my delicious.

280
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,080
Speaker 0: Anyway what I discovered on a much lighter note from what we were just talking about Hulk Hogan is selling his mansion.

281
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:32,858
Speaker 1: Now I'll note right now that I do a Hulk Hogan impression, but I almost did a macho man ready savages by accident.

282
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:41,185
Speaker 0: I can only do macho man Randy Savage and quagmire All right now.

283
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:56,240
Speaker 0: the interesting thing I noted is one he's selling the mansion for 25 million dollars and the mansion has a lot of Weird rich guy things in it like special hardwood floors from only the hearts of Oaks and woven in a pattern Whoa and weird stuff.

284
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:07,146
Speaker 0: But the very interesting thing I noticed and Scott noticed it too when I read it to him was that this house has five bedrooms and eight Bathrooms, okay.

285
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:07,447
Speaker 1: Okay.

286
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,677
Speaker 1: So wait there is a bathroom for each bedroom.

287
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:11,279
Speaker 1: That's five.

288
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:17,401
Speaker 1: there's one downstairs six I Don't know.

289
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:18,325
Speaker 0: there's another.

290
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:22,580
Speaker 1: maybe there's like three stories of non bedroom.

291
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:25,368
Speaker 1: Maybe it's how many stories is it?

292
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,094
Speaker 0: You know, I didn't even read the whole article.

293
00:20:27,135 --> 00:20:27,837
Speaker 0: I suggest I'll read it.

294
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,688
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe there's like one for the maid quarters.

295
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,972
Speaker 0: No just in the house.

296
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:34,937
Speaker 0: There are more bathrooms in the maids quarters.

297
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:43,953
Speaker 0: Uh The only thing I can think of is a quote from an old webcomic that I read where I Want a bathroom so big it has a bathroom in it.

298
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,503
Speaker 0: Uh-huh That's all I got.

299
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:52,280
Speaker 1: Hulk Hogan selling his house, yeah, it seems to me like is he selling the house?

300
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,809
Speaker 1: I don't think he's selling it cuz he's poor.

301
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:55,640
Speaker 0: No, he's selling it because he moved to Miami Beach.

302
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:59,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like he's selling this mansion cuz it's a crazy mansion.

303
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:02,899
Speaker 1: It's not really the greatest most practical thing to live in.

304
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,359
Speaker 0: He's not like MC Hammer selling his mansion because his manager stole all his money.

305
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:14,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think MC Hammer had problems besides his manager ceiling is true He did but his manager was probably the final nail in that nail.

306
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:18,520
Speaker 1: Yep The manager just jumped off the sinking ship in the last lifeboat.

307
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:22,167
Speaker 1: The ship was already sinking with all the money.

308
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,953
Speaker 0: it was a ship made of money.

309
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the lifeboat made of money.

310
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:29,137
Speaker 1: He folded up the little dollar bills to make a boat.

311
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,229
Speaker 1: so gaming day excite bike.

312
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:37,978
Speaker 0: do Now first off.

313
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:39,979
Speaker 0: You all know excite bike.

314
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:49,730
Speaker 0: I would like to mention right now even though this isn't Scott's thing of the day That if you've ever thought you were good at excite bike No, you're wrong and there's a Google video to prove it.

315
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:55,827
Speaker 1: but anyway Oops, I started the thing of the day.

316
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:56,390
Speaker 0: All right.

317
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:56,932
Speaker 0: So what's your thing?

318
00:21:56,972 --> 00:22:03,130
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's this flash game That's excite bike, but it's not the excite bike you're used to.

319
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,261
Speaker 1: What did?

320
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:04,943
Speaker 1: what you do?

321
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:10,360
Speaker 1: is the excite bike guy starts going and you can't really change lanes or anything like that.

322
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,038
Speaker 1: it's just you're on the bottom row and First is a meter that goes back and forth.

323
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:19,370
Speaker 1: need to push the spacebar when the meter is full to get a good start.

324
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:20,976
Speaker 0: All right, whatever.

325
00:22:21,077 --> 00:22:21,358
Speaker 0: Yeah,

326
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:37,372
Speaker 1: then the guy goes and he hits a jump and Using the ASD keys and the arrow and the W key and the arrow keys You do tricks while you're in the air like flipping over the bike, you know, all kinds of crazy motocross east All right,

327
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:40,049
Speaker 0: so it's just excite bike style and it's not really excite bike.

328
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,514
Speaker 1: No, it's not really excite bike.

329
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:49,441
Speaker 1: and the more tricks you do the faster you go the more airtime you get the more tricks You do the faster you go.

330
00:22:49,461 --> 00:23:00,650
Speaker 1: Uh-huh now Even more fun than that for me at least was this other mode Where you choose a number of trucks to jump over one through ten?

331
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,494
Speaker 1: And you jump in.

332
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:09,062
Speaker 1: the way you build up speed in that mode is by going ASASASASAS hitting the A and S keys in rapid succession.

333
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:11,010
Speaker 0: I got a mad Nintendo finger.

334
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:15,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is the Nintendo finger test for everyone out there.

335
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:18,170
Speaker 1: I was able to jump over all ten trucks.

336
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,884
Speaker 1: Whoa, you jump over all ten trucks.

337
00:23:21,306 --> 00:23:22,090
Speaker 1: That is the question.

338
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:26,064
Speaker 1: If you can't don't play Mario Party with me, you'll just lose.

339
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:35,764
Speaker 0: I Remember that time you and me were on a team in Mario Party and I forget who we were playing against and it was the Game where it was teams and it was who can it a the most?

340
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,340
Speaker 0: and we won by like 400 button presses or something sick.

341
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,088
Speaker 1: It was something really sick.

342
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:47,250
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright anyway, it's gaming day and we haven't talked about board games in a while.

343
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,625
Speaker 0: So we decided we pull out a game that we we like.

344
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:51,630
Speaker 0: we've played it a bunch of times.

345
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:53,209
Speaker 0: I bought it completely on a whim.

346
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:58,484
Speaker 1: It's a real impressive looking game and it's also a computer game that go.

347
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,548
Speaker 1: that's almost the same.

348
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,843
Speaker 0: Yep It is railroad tycoon.

349
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:09,799
Speaker 0: Yeah Now it's not true while the game is railroad themed and it plays like a railroad game.

350
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:24,974
Speaker 0: It is not a Railroad game not with a capital R. Anyway, yeah, it's like I'm a libertarian but not with a capital L. railroad game with a capital R or capital L is Kranz and wax paper.

351
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:33,784
Speaker 0: if you've ever seen a game with a bunch of scary dudes sitting around a table with a bunch of wax paper And maps and they're drawing colored lines on it and they're yelling at each other.

352
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,490
Speaker 0: That is a railroad game.

353
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:39,653
Speaker 0: I find them scary and frightening Mm-hmm.

354
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:43,061
Speaker 0: This is just a fun happy game to play with your friends and move little cubes around.

355
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:44,786
Speaker 1: Oh the cubes.

356
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:48,875
Speaker 0: It's not the most Intellectually demanding game.

357
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:53,670
Speaker 0: It's not the most hardcore German game, but it's a solid game.

358
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:57,182
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fun and it's very tactical and strategic.

359
00:24:57,202 --> 00:24:57,945
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

360
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,735
Speaker 1: It's also Pretty free.

361
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:03,250
Speaker 1: like you can do all sorts of different stuff in this game.

362
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,400
Speaker 1: It's not like other games that there's just a few decisions to make.

363
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:11,602
Speaker 1: you're you're free to do all kinds of crazy stuff Yep, and many of them are profitable.

364
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,250
Speaker 0: The game is very well balanced in that regard.

365
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like no matter what you do.

366
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,040
Speaker 1: You'll always profit.

367
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:22,827
Speaker 0: The key is to just profit faster and more Yep, and the game will come down to a lot of little decisions you made throughout the game.

368
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:24,532
Speaker 0: Yep Yep.

369
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:24,853
Speaker 1: Yep.

370
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:25,135
Speaker 1: Yep.

371
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:25,657
Speaker 1: Okay.

372
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:27,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game works.

373
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,230
Speaker 0: All right, the game is very simple.

374
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,121
Speaker 0: You have a very large board.

375
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:31,509
Speaker 0: That is the eastern United States.

376
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,319
Speaker 1: You know it the eastern half of the United States.

377
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:42,432
Speaker 0: it goes all the way out to the middle of the country where Kansas is Yep, and then it has two links that represent the West but you don't need to worry about them There's.

378
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:42,492
Speaker 0: no.

379
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:45,887
Speaker 0: I've seen people who made expansions, but it's just not worth it.

380
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:53,270
Speaker 0: Yeah and Basically, here's the thing you have money and you use money to buy railroad tracks between cities.

381
00:25:53,651 --> 00:26:12,957
Speaker 0: you also use money to buy other things like upgrading trains and buying equipment and Buying the right to go first on a turn and your main goal is to ship cubes from one sit from cities to other cities Thereby generating profit thereby using that profit to ship more cubes and in the course of all this getting victory points Mm-hmm.

382
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,054
Speaker 1: So let's say there's a city.

383
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,318
Speaker 1: every city has cubes in it.

384
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:19,406
Speaker 1: at the beginning a random assortment a random assortment.

385
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:24,542
Speaker 1: and you know Different cities have different numbers of cubes based on how much industry is in that city.

386
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:26,870
Speaker 0: Yep, and each cube represents an industry.

387
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,095
Speaker 0: It's a very abstract thing very abstract.

388
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:37,381
Speaker 1: So let's say there's a red cube in Florida somewhere and I guess it'd be some city in Florida Tampa, I guess.

389
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:38,486
Speaker 1: Is that on the map?

390
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:52,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tampa's on the map all right, and the nearest red city because you can only send red cubes to red cities you see is I don't know somewhere in Carolina or something some other city.

391
00:26:52,527 --> 00:27:00,071
Speaker 1: Yes So now you had to build railroad track from Florida to Carolina in order to send the cube from one city to the next One.

392
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:04,450
Speaker 0: now you can only lay certain amounts of track per round.

393
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:07,080
Speaker 0: So there are a lot of links that just can't be made.

394
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,410
Speaker 0: Yep, so you have to stop over in other cities.

395
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:16,169
Speaker 0: so you'll make a track from Chicago to Detroit and then Detroit to Toledo and then Toledo to whatnot.

396
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:25,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then if you want to ship from Chicago to whatnot and it goes through to other cities You need an upgraded train to make that trip because it has too many stops.

397
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:32,781
Speaker 0: Now the one gimmick here is that when you build a track because you paid for it It's your track, but anyone can use any track on the board.

398
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:35,430
Speaker 0: The thing is you have to pay for the privilege.

399
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:49,430
Speaker 1: So if I send a cube from what my city Across my track then across my track again then across the rims track I get two points and he gets one point because I used one of his tracks and two of my tracks.

400
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:52,659
Speaker 0: So there's definitely a competitive thing going on.

401
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:56,890
Speaker 0: plus because of that say there's a city and two people have rail lines going out of it.

402
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:59,849
Speaker 0: They'll be fighting to ship those cubes out first and get rid of them.

403
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:06,369
Speaker 1: Yeah people will often ship cubes out over other people's tracks just to force cubes to be shipped.

404
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:20,430
Speaker 1: and Maybe you know Maybe it's a six player game and rim is lost and I'm in second place and I can ship a cube Over my track and then maybe five of rim tracks and I get one point for that.

405
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:21,494
Speaker 1: I might do it.

406
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:22,779
Speaker 1: it empties cubes.

407
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:25,952
Speaker 1: It does also, you know, there's all kinds of crazy stuff You can do.

408
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:26,775
Speaker 0: now.

409
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,024
Speaker 0: you have used money to do all these things.

410
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:33,861
Speaker 0: but gimmick number two You don't start with any money.

411
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:37,894
Speaker 1: you start with jack and shit for money actually, nothing.

412
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:42,489
Speaker 0: you start with all the lowest level train you can have and nothing.

413
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:44,495
Speaker 0: So, how do you do anything?

414
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:48,387
Speaker 0: and I really like this mechanic and I'd love to see more games that involve money.

415
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:49,634
Speaker 0: use a mechanic Like this.

416
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:53,259
Speaker 0: you can sell Stock in yourself.

417
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:54,144
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

418
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,350
Speaker 0: You can sell shares.

419
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:59,081
Speaker 0: Basically, you will sell say five shares.

420
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,468
Speaker 0: I think you get five thousand dollars for every share.

421
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,853
Speaker 0: you sell Every round.

422
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:12,789
Speaker 0: well every turn you then have to pay interest on all those forever Dividends dividends, you can never buy off or pay off a share, right?

423
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,250
Speaker 0: So you say in the beginning of the game you take two shares.

424
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:18,061
Speaker 0: So now you get ten grand every round.

425
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,350
Speaker 0: for the rest of the game you pay two grand back to the bank.

426
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:24,985
Speaker 1: Yep, so you want to take as few shares as possible, but at the same time.

427
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:33,334
Speaker 1: if you take more shares Maybe you can get a big start in the game with a big pile of money, you know, so it's all about Managing.

428
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:43,630
Speaker 1: if you take too few shares other people will jump ahead of you in the game But if you take too many you won't be able to make anything profitable early in the game and you'll end up just.

429
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:53,337
Speaker 1: You can screw yourself over by taking too many shares and end up with a very slow-moving Useless unprofitable railroad company.

430
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:59,473
Speaker 0: You can also screw yourself by not taking enough shares not expanding fast enough and being cut out of all The important markets.

431
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:00,156
Speaker 1: Yep.

432
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:00,597
Speaker 1: Yep.

433
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:00,838
Speaker 1: Yep.

434
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,974
Speaker 0: There's a very fine line that I have often crossed Often.

435
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,624
Speaker 1: the first time I played I took way too.

436
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,170
Speaker 1: I thought I was trying to limit shares.

437
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:12,889
Speaker 1: I took two way too many because what happened was you get in the ultimate.

438
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:15,860
Speaker 1: worst Situation is when you take a few shares.

439
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:20,649
Speaker 1: you took a couple more than you wanted to but okay, whatever You know, it's only a couple more shares, you know.

440
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:28,730
Speaker 1: And then you don't have enough money to pay those shares off and now you have to take a share to pay off the shares.

441
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:34,010
Speaker 0: That and for anyone who knows math and even if you don't you can figure out as a bad idea.

442
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,585
Speaker 1: You pretty much have no choice though.

443
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,510
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not good.

444
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:44,490
Speaker 1: So then you have no money to do any railroading to get more money to pay off these shares no money.

445
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:45,879
Speaker 1: So what do you do?

446
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,469
Speaker 1: you take some shares?

447
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,012
Speaker 1: Great.

448
00:30:49,775 --> 00:31:00,010
Speaker 0: Now there's another gimmick involving the shares in that at the end of the game You lose one victory point and one victory point in this game is a big deal for every share that you have.

449
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:05,150
Speaker 1: So Shaking shares is not good, but necessary.

450
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:11,990
Speaker 1: It's like you must do something that hurts you in order to win, but everyone must do it.

451
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,417
Speaker 0: So it's who manages that must the best.

452
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:14,798
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,105
Speaker 1: The game also has these cards.

454
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:17,788
Speaker 0: These are.

455
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:18,590
Speaker 0: these are a real nice.

456
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,312
Speaker 0: I don't want to call them a gimmick But they.

457
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:29,950
Speaker 0: without these the game would be very stagnant because aside from the randomization of the cubes on the cities The strategies would pretty much always be the same because the board static.

458
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:30,632
Speaker 1: Yep.

459
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:30,933
Speaker 1: now.

460
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:36,110
Speaker 1: so even though the cards add randomness they add flavor and they're not secret.

461
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:38,846
Speaker 1: So everyone can look at them and make a decision based on it.

462
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:39,490
Speaker 1: So it's not bad.

463
00:31:40,513 --> 00:31:51,719
Speaker 1: And what they do is all their different kinds of cards but the interesting ones are the ones that say if you do this you get a pile of money or If you do this, then you get all these goodies.

464
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,490
Speaker 1: It's like first person to ship a cube here.

465
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,376
Speaker 1: So everyone will race to ship a cube there.

466
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:59,823
Speaker 0: a lot of more abilities to like.

467
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:03,253
Speaker 0: anyone who has this card can build extra tracks You know.

468
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:11,479
Speaker 1: or anyone who has this card can put more cubes in a city Yep, or just take an extra turn all sorts of fun stuff.

469
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,860
Speaker 0: Yep.

470
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:15,550
Speaker 0: There are also character cards, which there's definitely another gimmick.

471
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:20,284
Speaker 0: Every person in the game has a secret card and they're doled out randomly

472
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:21,387
Speaker 1: at the beginning of the game

473
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:30,757
Speaker 0: and you look at it And it gives you a name a name of some famous old railroad tycoon and a relevant goal and you get bonus victory points at The end if you accomplish that goal,

474
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:34,190
Speaker 1: so for my favorite one is take the least shares.

475
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:39,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're that guy and you take the least shares at the end of the game you get like 10 points.

476
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,236
Speaker 1: now There's nothing like that.

477
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:44,073
Speaker 0: There are two cards that say that Mm-hmm.

478
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:58,930
Speaker 0: So you might have two people who neither one of them knows it, but they're both competing for the least shares And Crazy cuz then one of them's gonna get points and one of them isn't don't don't Yep.

479
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:01,804
Speaker 0: But other than that, I mean the game is very simple.

480
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:02,609
Speaker 0: you build tracks.

481
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:06,909
Speaker 0: Well, basically we'll go over the road how the game actually works now that we've covered all the gimmicks.

482
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:14,572
Speaker 0: Okay, you you get your money with the shares and the game is could consist of turns and every turn Consist.

483
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,176
Speaker 0: well every round just call them rounds.

484
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:16,678
Speaker 0: go that way.

485
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,930
Speaker 0: there are rounds and within a round there are three sets of turns.

486
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:23,982
Speaker 0: So it goes around and everyone takes the turn.

487
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:25,730
Speaker 0: then it goes around and everyone takes the turn.

488
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:28,169
Speaker 0: Then it goes around a third time and everyone takes the turn.

489
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,735
Speaker 0: Then the whole thing is over.

490
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:35,910
Speaker 0: then you do the paying dividends out and taking new shares and all the stuff between.

491
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:46,319
Speaker 0: Now the other mechanic here is that when you build railroad tracks you can only build I think four Sections of track for each of your turns.

492
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:48,046
Speaker 1: so you can at most.

493
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:54,930
Speaker 0: you can build twelve Yep, and that's if you do nothing, but build the maximum every time it's your turn for an entire round.

494
00:33:56,011 --> 00:34:04,104
Speaker 0: And if you build any tracks that don't connect to cities within the scope of your three turns Then they're wiped off the board and you just wasted all your money.

495
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:05,170
Speaker 1: Good job.

496
00:34:05,992 --> 00:34:09,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to pay for each tile of track you put on the board.

497
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:15,150
Speaker 0: You also have to pay more if you go over like mountains or over rivers or through it to make a tunnel.

498
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:18,761
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really it sucks to pay for building track.

499
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,427
Speaker 1: That's pretty much what it comes down to.

500
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:21,429
Speaker 0: it costs a lot.

501
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:33,942
Speaker 0: The thing is once the game's going especially towards the end of the game or the middle of the game Especially you'll have so much money and profit that you don't care and you're just blowing tracks through mountains everywhere left and right unless you suck And then you suck.

502
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:41,850
Speaker 1: Yep But there's also lots of strategy and placement of track because you can prevent other people from building tracks in efficient ways.

503
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:45,243
Speaker 1: They'll have to go and take an inefficient route that cost more money.

504
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:51,929
Speaker 0: also deciding where to build I mean say it's a four player game and three players are all fighting over the Northeast in New York.

505
00:34:52,753 --> 00:34:55,449
Speaker 0: You just start building in the Midwest where no one's competing with you.

506
00:34:55,931 --> 00:35:01,990
Speaker 1: Yep, even though you have to the cities there in the Northeast are closer together and have a lot of cubes.

507
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:09,643
Speaker 1: So early in the game, that's really good because it doesn't cost a lot to Set something up that can ship cubes, but later on in the game.

508
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:11,689
Speaker 1: There won't be any cubes left over there.

509
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:18,604
Speaker 1: But you it's harder to start out in the middle of nowhere early in the game Because you have to spend more money because the cities are farther away.

510
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,733
Speaker 1: you had to build more track Of course.

511
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:23,781
Speaker 0: our friend Pete showed us very very powerfully one game.

512
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,323
Speaker 0: We played.

513
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:26,810
Speaker 1: what happens when no one is watching what you're doing?

514
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:31,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're all fighting over the Northeast and the Southeast and a little bit over the Midwest.

515
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:38,630
Speaker 0: Pete just built tracks all over the West And we weren't paying attention and then we realized that he had built the Western link.

516
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,370
Speaker 0: So he connected to the West and then he built lines from there all the way to Chicago.

517
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:45,778
Speaker 0: Which is this crazy thing in the game?

518
00:35:45,818 --> 00:35:48,790
Speaker 1: There's a card about it and everything and then all the way to New York.

519
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:56,330
Speaker 0: yeah, he got Yeah more points from that than all of us had gotten from our squabbling in New York combined.

520
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:09,050
Speaker 1: basically because what it does is the Western link to Chicago and this card makes a whole pile of red cubes and then if you connect Chicago to New York and You have a good enough train that can make that whole trip.

521
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:13,730
Speaker 1: All of those red cubes get you like five the zillion points each.

522
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:23,435
Speaker 1: so every turn he just shipped those red cubes and All we could do about it was maybe steal those red cubes and ship them somewhere else on our own Which is tough.

523
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:29,330
Speaker 0: one of the mechanics of shipping cubes, which we should probably talk about Is that you can ship cubes over any train lines?

524
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:35,370
Speaker 0: But the first line that any cube goes over that you're trying to ship has to go over one of your trains.

525
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:40,615
Speaker 1: so if you want to steal cubes from Chicago, you need to have a Connection with you.

526
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:42,102
Speaker 1: that is belongs to you.

527
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:43,930
Speaker 1: from Chicago to somewhere else.

528
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:45,536
Speaker 0: Nope.

529
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:46,185
Speaker 0: Yeah.

530
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:53,331
Speaker 0: Yeah The way cubes work is that all the cities have cubes of different colors and you want to ship cubes to the city of their Color.

531
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:57,269
Speaker 0: if a red cube starts in a red city, you have to take it to a different red city.

532
00:36:57,971 --> 00:36:58,493
Speaker 0: Simple as that.

533
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:04,730
Speaker 0: you can't ship cubes over a city of the relevant color to another city of the relevant color.

534
00:37:05,231 --> 00:37:15,010
Speaker 1: yeah, so if it's like you have a purple cube in a blue city and then a train track goes to a red city then a Purple city then a yellow city and then a purple city.

535
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:22,529
Speaker 1: You can't ship it to the second purple city has to go to the closer Purple city because the first purple city will take the cube not the next one.

536
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:26,786
Speaker 0: Yep, which the reason that's important is that the way you get victory points.

537
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,909
Speaker 0: now on your rounds I said you can build four up to four sections of track.

538
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:37,315
Speaker 0: the other options you have are take one of those cards that may be leather to be laying face up or Ship a cube.

539
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:44,210
Speaker 0: So anytime you do something It's at the expense of shipping a cube or taking a card or doing one of the other things.

540
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:52,810
Speaker 1: It's really hard to decide sometimes on your turn because they'll be a really good piece of track You want to build and there'll be some cubes you want to ship and you can't do both.

541
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:58,650
Speaker 1: So it's always a fight should I ship the cubes or should I build the tracks, you know?

542
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:06,233
Speaker 1: It's like okay if I build the tracks then he'll get X points because he'll build the track first and then he'll ship that cube And all that.

543
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then he's thinking the same thing and the poison ends up going in both cups done.

544
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:18,370
Speaker 0: Now Say you get one point when you ship a cube for every section of track that it goes over.

545
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:19,434
Speaker 0: That is yours.

546
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,570
Speaker 0: And like we said any other sections of track that it goes over those people get the points.

547
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:36,849
Speaker 0: Now the interesting thing about this game is the way Scoring and income and all that work because we keep talking about money and dividends and selling shares in your stock But we didn't explain how to get actual money to pay all this off.

548
00:38:38,112 --> 00:38:40,530
Speaker 0: Every victory point you get moves you up on this scale.

549
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,010
Speaker 1: There's a scale going up both sides of the board and everyone starts at zero, which means your income is like four thousand.

550
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:47,801
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

551
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:48,729
Speaker 1: It's really low.

552
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,658
Speaker 1: you basically barely get any money at the beginning.

553
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,129
Speaker 0: for every victory point that you get you move up the scale.

554
00:38:55,149 --> 00:39:02,530
Speaker 0: and As you move up the scale the income you get for every round, you know set of three turns increases.

555
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:07,076
Speaker 0: So shipping a bunch of cubes Increases your income permanently.

556
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:10,065
Speaker 0: Thus you have more money to build more things to ship more cubes.

557
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:11,550
Speaker 1: The thing is the scale.

558
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:16,030
Speaker 1: Eventually when you get a ton of it now, of course over as the most victory points wins.

559
00:39:16,331 --> 00:39:25,021
Speaker 1: Yes, more victory points is always better no matter what but if you get too many victory points I think around like 30 or 40 50 victory points.

560
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:33,430
Speaker 1: when you start getting up there your income starts Decreasing because your railroad is large and unwieldy and you're to pay to maintain it and all that.

561
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:40,610
Speaker 1: So someone who's getting way ahead in the game gets slowed down by decreased income.

562
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,150
Speaker 0: But at the same time you want to build up to that high income while you're profitable.

563
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:53,183
Speaker 0: Then during that time instead of shipping cubes and dropping out of that income area You just start building tracks everywhere or picking up all those cards.

564
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,427
Speaker 0: You're gonna need later in the game.

565
00:39:54,447 --> 00:39:57,098
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm There's a lot of strategy involved in that.

566
00:39:57,118 --> 00:39:59,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's ship cubes ship cubes ship cubes.

567
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,238
Speaker 1: My income if I ship any more cubes will decrease.

568
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,808
Speaker 1: Let me build a bunch of tracks while my income is high.

569
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:17,909
Speaker 1: now That I've built a bunch of tracks I will ship cubes ship cubes to get a bunch of victory points not caring that my income will decrease Because I've already built all my tracks while my income was high.

570
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:28,110
Speaker 0: Meanwhile everyone else in the game is doing the exact same thing you're doing and there's crazy competition and you can't really predict What everyone is going to do and there's so many chaotic factors involved.

571
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:33,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way the game works really goes along with the theme of competing railroad tycoons.

572
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:34,870
Speaker 1: I must say it does.

573
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:43,370
Speaker 0: Now you ship the cubes get the victory points use the cards get victory points and in the end it comes down to victory points.

574
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:48,030
Speaker 0: Now the game ends when a number of cities have run out of goods.

575
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,870
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of strategy in that as well.

576
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:51,415
Speaker 1: You know, you'll.

577
00:40:51,475 --> 00:41:06,630
Speaker 1: you'll see a city with one cube in it And if you want the game to end sooner Which is usually because you're winning you will try to to take the last cubes out of cities You know you and make those cities empty out because if a city has no cubes you put a brown thing in it.

578
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,014
Speaker 1: And what?

579
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:08,370
Speaker 1: how many brown things ends the game?

580
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,788
Speaker 0: It depends how many players you have.

581
00:41:09,955 --> 00:41:17,770
Speaker 1: Yeah But you want to get a lot of brown things out there to end the game quickly if you're winning if you're losing the game You want to use cards?

582
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:25,670
Speaker 1: To put cubes in empty cities to bring them back to life and you want to ship cubes From cities that have a bunch of cubes in them.

583
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:32,111
Speaker 1: That way they won't empty out and you'll be safe and the game can go longer and you have a chance to dethrone the current Winner.

584
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,681
Speaker 0: Yep, and the game is really volatile.

585
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:38,415
Speaker 0: I mean if someone pulls ahead in the beginning There's a decent chance.

586
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:41,527
Speaker 0: someone who's smart can just blow them away by the midpoint of the game.

587
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:41,948
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

588
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,115
Speaker 0: Now the game itself.

589
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:49,130
Speaker 0: the production values are very high except for a few tiny niggling little issues.

590
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:51,296
Speaker 0: The board is huge.

591
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:54,486
Speaker 1: The board is actually three boards and it's big.

592
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:57,117
Speaker 0: you lay them all next to each other And it's big and impressive looking.

593
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:58,545
Speaker 1: it takes up a whole table.

594
00:41:58,605 --> 00:41:59,430
Speaker 1: This thing is giant.

595
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:03,524
Speaker 0: It comes with a whole bunch of colored little train pieces made out of plastic.

596
00:42:03,544 --> 00:42:03,664
Speaker 0: Yep.

597
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:05,290
Speaker 1: Those are pretty cool.

598
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:07,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, except the their problems is like.

599
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,410
Speaker 1: the board is not a really fancy board.

600
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:19,019
Speaker 1: It's sort of a cheap board and make what it makes up for what it loot what it lacks in Thickness and sturdiness it makes up for in size.

601
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,410
Speaker 1: Yeah quantity and those little plastic trains are really cool But some of them little chimneys break off whatever.

602
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:26,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it comes.

603
00:42:27,357 --> 00:42:31,270
Speaker 0: the only real drawback other than the fact that the boards a little cheap is that it comes with paper money.

604
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:33,318
Speaker 1: Oh paper money is the worst.

605
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:35,570
Speaker 0: paper money is annoying but it kind of works in this game.

606
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, the shares are nice.

607
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:38,444
Speaker 1: The cards are nice.

608
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:45,186
Speaker 1: the train Upgrade things are really thick cardboard like tiles.

609
00:42:45,226 --> 00:42:52,166
Speaker 1: I don't know why they did that But it works, you know, everything is pretty good except for the paper money.

610
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:53,750
Speaker 0: Also the game is real expensive.

611
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:57,721
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game is pretty expensive and the board is big and it's heavy.

612
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:01,090
Speaker 0: The thing is I mean, we're hardcore German gamers.

613
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:06,270
Speaker 0: We like the the brains banging against each other bevagon odor very schlagen see games.

614
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:08,761
Speaker 0: And this gives a really fun game.

615
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,690
Speaker 0: it's a good game to get six people together.

616
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:13,710
Speaker 0: I don't recommend playing it with fewer than two or three.

617
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,285
Speaker 0: Well, not fewer than two, but fewer than three or four people.

618
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:17,069
Speaker 0: It's just not as fun.

619
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:19,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, we played it with two and it was kind of a.

620
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:21,510
Speaker 0: yeah, we played it with three and it was okay.

621
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:24,450
Speaker 0: but if you play it with a full set of players it becomes.

622
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:45,250
Speaker 1: Thing is even though the game has ways to make up for the fact that there aren't enough players and that it takes a different number of empty cities to end the game if there aren't that many players what ends up happening is There isn't enough of that land-grabbing competition with a lot of players.

623
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:47,910
Speaker 1: You're really right into the game.

624
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,304
Speaker 1: You're fighting for.

625
00:43:49,324 --> 00:43:54,425
Speaker 1: you know The cities and the connections and all that stuff because someone else will get it before you do.

626
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:55,850
Speaker 0: and that's the fun part of the game.

627
00:43:55,971 --> 00:44:06,290
Speaker 0: I mean you can't directly screw people you can't directly make deals with people But there's just all this fierce competition and there's a long time between when you take your turn and everyone else takes theirs

628
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,210
Speaker 1: Yep, and in a two or three player game, you're everyone pretty much has all the room.

629
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,904
Speaker 1: They want to build whatever they want without anyone else getting in the way.

630
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,956
Speaker 1: It's like oh if he's gonna go over there I'll just go over here where he's not.

631
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:19,706
Speaker 0: the game causes a lot of yelling which is good.

632
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:20,890
Speaker 0: We like games that cause yelling.

633
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,091
Speaker 1: Yep, yelling is fun.

634
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:29,418
Speaker 1: How long is it?

635
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:32,020
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

636
00:44:42,021 --> 00:44:45,180
Speaker 0: So I mean in some railroad tycoon is probably a good buy.

637
00:44:45,822 --> 00:44:50,380
Speaker 0: I can't imagine any board gamer who would dislike this game significantly.

638
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:56,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you are a board gamer, you will probably like railroad tycoon and I was just a normal person.

639
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:56,850
Speaker 1: I don't know.

640
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:57,439
Speaker 0: You know what?

641
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:12,560
Speaker 0: I know I think normal people, you know Normies or muggles or people who aren't really into heavy German board games Would probably really enjoy this game as long as they played it with at least a few Gamers who knew how to play and were hardcore knew what was going on to kind of guide them.

642
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:22,352
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game definitely is more accessible to normal folk than say a Tigris and Euphrates But it's not as accessible as say a battleship or an UNO.

643
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:24,660
Speaker 0: true true, but you get a lot out of it.

644
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,220
Speaker 0: I mean someone who doesn't know much about board gaming could really enjoy this game.

645
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:38,915
Speaker 0: And the thing is even if you're losing Even if you're just getting your ass kicked into the ground handed to you and beaten You're still building some tracks and putting some trains on them and it's real fun.

646
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:43,350
Speaker 0: moving moving some cubes around You always feel like you're accomplishing something.

647
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:56,639
Speaker 1: the first time I played I started out basically You know in the hole going deeper into the hole, but after a few turns, you know I I managed to just slowly crawl out of the hole and I was profiting and building stuff.

648
00:45:57,503 --> 00:45:59,212
Speaker 1: You know, I never was able.

649
00:45:59,534 --> 00:46:05,620
Speaker 1: everyone else, you know I was already way ahead of me on the curve and was building a lot more stuff and shipping a lot more cubes.

650
00:46:06,142 --> 00:46:09,437
Speaker 1: But I you know, I did something and it felt pretty good.

651
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:10,582
Speaker 0: Yep That's the thing.

652
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:14,677
Speaker 0: The game is very fun in addition to the fact that it's very tactical and very strategic.

653
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:18,508
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But that's enough about railroad tycoon.

654
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,036
Speaker 0: I know we haven't talked about board games a lot.

655
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:22,260
Speaker 0: We're glad to bring it back.

656
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,069
Speaker 0: We'd like to get some feedback as always.

657
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:26,360
Speaker 0: I don't know how many of you out there have played this game.

658
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,048
Speaker 0: I recommend picking it up if you find it cheap.

659
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:30,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did the game cost you?

660
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,142
Speaker 1: 60 80.

661
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:34,529
Speaker 0: I think it was like 60 but I got that discount.

662
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,412
Speaker 0: That's right.

663
00:46:35,472 --> 00:46:36,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's.

664
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:38,020
Speaker 1: it's a big expensive game.

665
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:40,589
Speaker 1: You know in size and everything.

666
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:41,733
Speaker 0: it's real impressive looking.

667
00:46:41,753 --> 00:46:50,820
Speaker 0: if you're at a convention where there's a lot of space It's a great game to set up somewhere, especially since you'll you're gonna need like two tables stuck together to play.

668
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:52,726
Speaker 1: Conventions are a great place.

669
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:53,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll got.

670
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,234
Speaker 0: you'll gather a crowd real quick.

671
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:56,960
Speaker 1: Yeah people say what's this?

672
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:04,840
Speaker 1: it's huge and look at all those trains and whoa, it's big and They'll just hang around you and watch everything you're doing.

673
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:15,137
Speaker 0: Yep, and I'll find a little meta bit here because I know after yesterday's show I've gotten a lot of feedback and some people are giving me some really good advice on things I can do to make my Mac experience better.

674
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:19,596
Speaker 0: Most people seem to agree that garage band doesn't have a lot of deficiencies.

675
00:47:19,616 --> 00:47:43,508
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm but the only real point of contention I've seen now is that a lot of people are Saying that the PC itself the Intel core Little single core is not fast enough or that there's a performance problem with the hardware which I am 99% sure is not true because this is a screaming little machine for what it's worth.

676
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:45,826
Speaker 0: and This week at some point.

677
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:58,948
Speaker 0: We're going to boot camp and install Ubuntu Ubuntu on it and Then run resound and audacity and do the podcast the way we do in Linux in Linux just on this hardware Mm-hmm, and I'll have a full report on that.

678
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:10,734
Speaker 0: All right, because we do know that there is a lot of overhead in OS X. OS X is really pretty and great for day-to-day use But there's just there's a lot of overhead and we're going to be able to see exactly how much overhead.

679
00:48:10,895 --> 00:48:14,890
Speaker 1: plus most of our complaints Aren't the fact that it's slow.

680
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,680
Speaker 1: I mean or that, you know, it ran out of RAM?

681
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:19,674
Speaker 1: Okay, the problem is not that it ran out of RAM.

682
00:48:19,714 --> 00:48:20,880
Speaker 1: The problem is that it ran out of RAM.

683
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,286
Speaker 1: It didn't say anything though.

684
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:27,854
Speaker 0: If you look at the forums, it looks like that was just an even stupider bug About tempo and beats per minute.

685
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:39,358
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, it's like I'm verifying it now, but it looks like GarageBand is limited severely in that it can only keep track of X number of events.

686
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:47,544
Speaker 0: so by default it has a beats per minute thing a tempo which because it was originally a Music program.

687
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:49,031
Speaker 1: Well, it still is a music program.

688
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:51,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but now they hype it for podcasting.

689
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,908
Speaker 0: They don't say much about the music aspect of it.

690
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:53,290
Speaker 0: Yep.

691
00:48:54,053 --> 00:48:55,580
Speaker 0: It still has that in the podcasting.

692
00:48:55,981 --> 00:49:00,138
Speaker 0: It has a feature that has no context in podcasting, but it's still there.

693
00:49:00,158 --> 00:49:00,720
Speaker 0: Wait, wait.

694
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,537
Speaker 1: So there's beats per minute in our podcast.

695
00:49:02,698 --> 00:49:03,723
Speaker 0: Yes Which get this?

696
00:49:03,844 --> 00:49:05,009
Speaker 1: um, dumb dumb.

697
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:08,943
Speaker 0: when it maxes out the number that it can deal with It just stops recording.

698
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:19,119
Speaker 0: and the way to fix that as two people told me is to set the tempo to like 40 beats per Minute instead of the standard 120. that way it won't run out so quickly and you can record longer.

699
00:49:20,262 --> 00:49:26,360
Speaker 0: Wow that that is a prime example of Context being used improperly.

700
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:29,120
Speaker 1: That is the kind of stuff that we're complaining about.

701
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,340
Speaker 1: It's the design of the software design of the interface of the software the code of the software.

702
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:40,567
Speaker 1: The reason we bought it was for the software and the software is bad But it was not free and I want to say right now.

703
00:49:40,627 --> 00:49:49,533
Speaker 0: It's not OS X. I am absolutely enjoying OS X. It's running really well and other than GarageBand things are generally pretty awesome.

704
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:57,518
Speaker 0: I'm mostly complaining about GarageBand Yep, and I'm complaining about Apple for hyping GarageBand saying it can do things that it doesn't do so well.

705
00:49:57,859 --> 00:50:02,560
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But anyway, that's talk for next Monday and yesterday and yesterday.

706
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,329
Speaker 1: Well next Monday is gonna be I think how computers work some more.

707
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:11,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless we have a lot to say after we Ubuntu eyes Yeah, actually we could do it.

708
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,532
Speaker 1: We since we just did a show about Mac we could do a show about.

709
00:50:14,552 --> 00:50:16,640
Speaker 1: I think we didn't Ubuntu show before.

710
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:16,784
Speaker 1: Yeah

711
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:36,312
Speaker 0: Actually, what I'd like to do is do a show on UI and context and all this stuff because I've noticed that I've had trouble explaining to people why I dislike GarageBand mostly because a lot of people don't seem to know all of the interface design or human computer interaction or Usability engineering terms or terminology like.

712
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,236
Speaker 1: they don't know what it means.

713
