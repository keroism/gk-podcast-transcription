1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,669
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, August 8th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,250
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:12,972
Speaker 0: I'm Skun.

4
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:15,760
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, Australia!

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,245
Speaker 0: It's down under today.

6
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:22,171
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:26,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like we said last week, we're back from Australia.

8
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:33,827
Speaker 1: We didn't talk much about Australia because we mostly talked about the semi-related things that happened at, I don't know, PAX.

9
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:39,032
Speaker 0: We gotta save up our load so that we can have a Thursday show idea because you know what's gonna happen.

10
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,709
Speaker 0: the next time is a Thursday episode is gonna be like, "I want you to do the show about...".

11
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,423
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things I would like to do the show on.

12
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:45,848
Speaker 0: Yeah.

13
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:46,610
Speaker 0: All bad ideas.

14
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:47,733
Speaker 1: Lots of good ideas.

15
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:48,756
Speaker 0: Bad ideas.

16
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:52,570
Speaker 1: I bet if I brought it up and I mentioned one or two ideas ahead...

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,910
Speaker 0: You could say any idea and the listener would say that it's a great idea.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,359
Speaker 1: I think the listener is usually on my side.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,692
Speaker 0: There is no idea you could say no matter how bad it was.

20
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:05,318
Speaker 0: Like, talk about Starfish.

21
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:06,743
Speaker 0: The listener would be like, "Fuck

22
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:07,165
Speaker 0: yeah!".

23
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:12,147
Speaker 1: I could talk about Starfish for about four minutes and I'd be out of Starfish talk.

24
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:12,850
Speaker 0: They're cute.

25
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,936
Speaker 0: The legs grow back.

26
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:15,142
Speaker 0: There's big ones and small ones.

27
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:15,706
Speaker 0: I like them.

28
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,116
Speaker 1: It's kind of funny the way they move around.

29
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,101
Speaker 1: The way they eat is cool.

30
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:19,988
Speaker 0: They can get stuck on things.

31
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:20,429
Speaker 1: Yup.

32
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:22,436
Speaker 1: Their little beak is kind of cute.

33
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,042
Speaker 0: I'd say they're cute already.

34
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:25,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the beak is particularly cute.

35
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,641
Speaker 0: The star part is cuter than the beak part.

36
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:33,034
Speaker 1: They have a different kind of symmetry from what we have in many ways.

37
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:37,412
Speaker 1: I think we can pad that out a little bit with some banter back and forth.

38
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:42,454
Speaker 0: I don't think you have nineteen and a half minutes remaining of Starfish stuff.

39
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:46,990
Speaker 1: I get the feeling that the listener is usually on my side and I think you're correct in that sentiment.

40
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:48,355
Speaker 0: Anyway.

41
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:48,857
Speaker 0: I don't know.

42
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,724
Speaker 1: We keep stealing that listener joke.

43
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,034
Speaker 1: Points to anyone who knows what we stole it from.

44
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:53,536
Speaker 0: Whatever.

45
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:54,560
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

46
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:59,343
Speaker 1: Not going to talk much about news, but we got some Australian news since we were just in Australia.

47
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically there's nothing going on in this country.

48
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:04,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no NSA scandal.

49
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:07,198
Speaker 1: A man named Wiener didn't show his dick to people again.

50
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,142
Speaker 0: That's not news either.

51
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,329
Speaker 0: It's the same old, same old.

52
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,979
Speaker 0: At least to us because we live in this country.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,006
Speaker 0: So we hear about that stuff.

54
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:13,698
Speaker 1: There was a mass shooting right before we left.

55
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,045
Speaker 1: There was a mass shooting while we were gone.

56
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,613
Speaker 1: There's a mass shooting like yesterday.

57
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not news either.

58
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:19,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:22,215
Speaker 1: So we're going to talk about Australian news.

60
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:29,704
Speaker 0: The only Australian news I noticed when I was there that wasn't sports was this news about a refugee boat or two.

61
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:30,790
Speaker 1: Now it was interesting.

62
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,274
Speaker 0: It wasn't clear how many there were because I was paying attention to other things and I only saw this news in passing.

63
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:53,519
Speaker 1: But what I noticed was that all the places I saw news around, like newspaper headlines on TV, it was pretty much almost entirely about this with a secondary thing about how some states are going to in Australia are going to legalize gay marriage ahead of the federal government doing it.

64
00:02:54,661 --> 00:03:03,510
Speaker 1: But it's interesting that because it was very, it's rare that the news in the US would have an issue like that that held the forefront.

65
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:08,689
Speaker 1: Is it just because we have more scandalous kind of news that makes national attention?

66
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,829
Speaker 1: Is it that we have more international connections so more stuff makes it to be news?

67
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,003
Speaker 1: It was weird to see a single narrative lasting for weeks.

68
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:17,548
Speaker 0: We weren't.

69
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,853
Speaker 0: No, you don't know.

70
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,908
Speaker 1: It was basically in the news the entire time we were there, which was just about two weeks.

71
00:03:23,691 --> 00:03:25,216
Speaker 1: We know we were there for weeks.

72
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:26,380
Speaker 0: No, you weren't.

73
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,802
Speaker 0: We were there.

74
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,167
Speaker 0: All right.

75
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,151
Speaker 0: Under two weeks.

76
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:29,492
Speaker 1: Yeah.

77
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:30,496
Speaker 1: More than one week.

78
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,440
Speaker 1: Therefore plural.

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,724
Speaker 0: No for it to be weeks.

80
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:33,165
Speaker 0: Plural.

81
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:38,987
Speaker 1: It must be at least two total and it was one full week and then portions of another week.

82
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,353
Speaker 0: So that doesn't make weeks.

83
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,284
Speaker 0: It involved two weeks and makes over a week.

84
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:46,252
Speaker 1: It involved two individual week.

85
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:48,860
Speaker 0: This is the rim strategy of exaggeration.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,185
Speaker 1: My point is simple.

87
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:56,295
Speaker 0: If you're going to exaggerate, you should just do what I do and do extreme hyperbole be like in the news for like a fucking 10 years.

88
00:03:56,315 --> 00:04:03,003
Speaker 1: I don't think that was much of an exaggeration also because I noticed that news before we went and then it's still in the news now.

89
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:08,100
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I had some boat full of people who came from a country I forget.

90
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,087
Speaker 1: You don't remember any of the details.

91
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:18,255
Speaker 1: So there's a wider problem in that Australia seems to have very liberal refugee laws compared to other countries.

92
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:33,565
Speaker 1: And those laws appear to be fairly popular and the government seems to have been trying to not exactly follow the spirit of those laws because they don't want all these refugees being resettled inside of mainland Australia.

93
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,563
Speaker 1: So they're trying to resettle refugees that are coming in and other places.

94
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,508
Speaker 1: Like they tried to make a deal.

95
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,328
Speaker 1: I think they did make a deal with a pop on New Guinea to have him go there instead.

96
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,526
Speaker 1: And that seems to be what is generating the liberal outrage in Australia right now.

97
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:47,631
Speaker 0: Yeah.

98
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:57,343
Speaker 0: It's like we went to the fucking immigration museum in Australia, which is all about, look, Australia, you know, forgetting the aboriginal situation, right?

99
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:00,798
Speaker 0: Is a, it's like, look, this is a place that's pretty much all immigrants.

100
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:01,743
Speaker 0: We all came here.

101
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,607
Speaker 0: We let people in.

102
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,120
Speaker 0: Look how awesome it is to let people in from all over the place.

103
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,702
Speaker 1: Glad we went to.

104
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,405
Speaker 1: that museum is the kind of, it was not a museum for people like us because we were foreigners.

105
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:11,310
Speaker 1: We're not Australians.

106
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,264
Speaker 1: And that was really, it'd be like if of someone who had no ties to the?

107
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:17,678
Speaker 1: u s whatsoever in any part of their family came to the?

108
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,082
Speaker 1: u s and went to Ellis Island.

109
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:19,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

110
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:29,600
Speaker 1: But seeing what Australia presents to its own people on that issue was great because the whole museum was pretty much, yeah, look how fucking racist we were.

111
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,366
Speaker 1: and yeah, we're still pretty racist.

112
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,132
Speaker 0: Let people fucking in.

113
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,036
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

114
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:34,497
Speaker 0: Yep.

115
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:37,246
Speaker 1: Or at least don't be really.

116
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:43,749
Speaker 1: It wasn't that long ago that major political parties in Australia had a, they called it the white Australia policy.

117
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

118
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,202
Speaker 1: Pretty much means exactly what it sounds like it means.

119
00:05:47,524 --> 00:06:00,210
Speaker 1: So this is a big issue, but it seems like at least from the media, there's a lot of popular support for the refugees and for the sort of more liberal ideas around it and the government's all fighting about it.

120
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,722
Speaker 1: And this was different nuances on this story.

121
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:05,500
Speaker 1: We're in the forefront of the news for pretty much the entire time we were there.

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,741
Speaker 0: Really?

123
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:11,368
Speaker 0: If you're a modern country and someone wants to move to your country, just say yes, just say yes every time.

124
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:12,473
Speaker 0: What's the fucking problem?

125
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:12,995
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

126
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:14,722
Speaker 0: If someone like Mexicans wants to come to the?

127
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,288
Speaker 0: u s just let them in.

128
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,616
Speaker 1: Uh, so you say we should have 100% open borders.

129
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:21,262
Speaker 0: Yeah.

130
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,190
Speaker 1: When I wouldn't cause any problem whatsoever.

131
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:23,733
Speaker 0: Criminal.

132
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,275
Speaker 0: All right.

133
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,856
Speaker 1: So already you have to have a system to not let anyone in and vet them if you want that.

134
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,949
Speaker 0: But you don't like set some number or something, right?

135
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:32,632
Speaker 0: And if there's like,

136
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:55,107
Speaker 1: you know, actually you kind of do to a degree, especially because people who immigrate fresh to a country tend to not go very far from where they came in and tend to settle in a very small number of places, which would put extreme load on local infrastructure and services coupled with the fact that u s uh, places don't really have very good social services for people who don't speak the language very well and don't have a lot of money.

137
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:56,352
Speaker 0: Those people moved here.

138
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:00,191
Speaker 0: They do just moving from one piece of land to another piece of land.

139
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,598
Speaker 0: If there's no infrastructure there.

140
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:01,739
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,889
Speaker 0: You're the person who lives there.

142
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,125
Speaker 1: What if more people than can comfortably and safely live in Finland want to go to Finland?

143
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,172
Speaker 1: It's a small place.

144
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:11,536
Speaker 1: Now watch these.

145
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:16,862
Speaker 1: Let one, one person in and it literally pushes another person out into the water to those people that live there.

146
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:17,764
Speaker 0: Right.

147
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:24,848
Speaker 0: You know, to take care of New York used to not be able to handle that many people, but you know what?

148
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:28,204
Speaker 0: Millions of people moved here and they built really big buildings.

149
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,374
Speaker 1: There were decades of misery in here as a result.

150
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,317
Speaker 1: This is earth.

151
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,335
Speaker 1: Everywhere is miserable in this right now is only slightly miserable.

152
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:43,540
Speaker 0: Basically say, okay, someone else is miserable and I'm happy, so I should keep that person miserable to maintain my happiness.

153
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,588
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying that spread the misery more.

154
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:50,666
Speaker 1: I'm saying that ridiculous idealism really falls flat in the face of basic pragmatism.

155
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:54,135
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, this is a boat full of people.

156
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,151
Speaker 0: There's no reason not to let this boat full of people move.

157
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,703
Speaker 1: But that's not what the arguments were all about.

158
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:02,351
Speaker 1: That boat was sort of a catalyst.

159
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:05,043
Speaker 1: They're saying in general, what should the policy be?

160
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:12,157
Speaker 1: Because there has been a fairly long standing flood of boat people, which is kind of what we've been calling people who came here from Cuba in the past.

161
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,609
Speaker 0: Someone comes in Cuba, we should also let them in.

162
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,900
Speaker 0: They voted all the way across the Caribbean.

163
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,933
Speaker 1: What if everyone in all of Europe simultaneously decided to come here?

164
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:21,796
Speaker 0: Sweet.

165
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:23,021
Speaker 1: That wouldn't work.

166
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,747
Speaker 1: There'd be mass starvation along the coasts.

167
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:25,731
Speaker 0: Okay.

168
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:26,975
Speaker 1: That's okay.

169
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:27,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would.

170
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,572
Speaker 0: People would come here and be like, oh, why did we come here?

171
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:31,739
Speaker 0: And then they would move.

172
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,205
Speaker 1: Where would they move?

173
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,238
Speaker 1: They'd die of starvation before they could move.

174
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:37,048
Speaker 1: There wouldn't be that much food along the coast anymore.

175
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:41,614
Speaker 0: The point of people are moving away from a place is because they didn't like that place and had problems.

176
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,284
Speaker 0: So they moved to a place that doesn't have problems.

177
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:47,007
Speaker 0: If that place starts to have problems, people aren't going to be attracted to that place anymore.

178
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:51,548
Speaker 1: And yet you did not want to do a Thursday show on immigration, but seemed to have a lot of opinions on immigration.

179
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,457
Speaker 1: This is when the news.

180
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:56,327
Speaker 1: Listener, should we do a show on immigration and continue this argument?

181
00:08:56,367 --> 00:09:01,023
Speaker 0: You could say any idea and people say yes.

182
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,593
Speaker 0: So do you want to do us to do a show on X?

183
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:04,497
Speaker 0: The answer is yes.

184
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,229
Speaker 1: Well, the letter X is not that it's not up to the listeners.

185
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,274
Speaker 0: What should we do?

186
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:09,058
Speaker 1: I say it should be.

187
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,102
Speaker 0: No, let's do it.

188
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,734
Speaker 1: Why shouldn't we just do whatever other people say.

189
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:13,959
Speaker 1: Why deny them happiness?

190
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,924
Speaker 1: Why say you don't get to have any input?

191
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:17,407
Speaker 1: You individual person.

192
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,188
Speaker 0: It's not your show.

193
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:24,483
Speaker 1: It's see what I did there.

194
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,229
Speaker 1: Let's move on.

195
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:40,714
Speaker 1: What really struck me about the news in Australia was that this was in the news and the other item that I saw at the top of my national news and I was poking around every morning was a single gun murder.

196
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:52,336
Speaker 1: I cannot imagine a situation in the U S where a single gun murder that doesn't have multiple political situations tied to it would make national news because there's a local gun murder.

197
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:57,297
Speaker 1: That's single gun murder pretty much everywhere in the U S pretty much every day.

198
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:57,397
Speaker 1: Yeah.

199
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:05,693
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not as crazy gun shooting is like you would think from say Japanese people seem to think that everyone in the U S has guns for some reason.

200
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,980
Speaker 1: A lot of us do have guns,

201
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,957
Speaker 0: but yeah, it's like, yeah, that's a local news and not a national news,

202
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:21,625
Speaker 1: but the fact that the national news had an article about the kind of shooting that would not even be the regional news in the U S says a lot about how effective gun control was at reducing gun violence in Australia.

203
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:25,140
Speaker 0: Well, who knows about violence in general, but yeah, gun violence.

204
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, it worked.

205
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:26,525
Speaker 0: Yeah.

206
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,398
Speaker 1: Regular violence is pretty low as well as far as I can tell.

207
00:10:29,598 --> 00:10:38,931
Speaker 1: Probably there's, uh, there's been an uptick according to the media in hooliganism and sort of bar fights and things like that among young white people.

208
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:41,160
Speaker 0: Oh, well that's common everywhere.

209
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Speaker 1: And there was a bunch of racial tensions in the Western, Eastern part, Western part.

210
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,672
Speaker 1: I forget what part already of Melbourne, the part of Melbourne.

211
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:52,048
Speaker 0: There was some racial, racial tension across the tracks.

212
00:10:52,551 --> 00:11:03,300
Speaker 1: I also learned that Melbourne very recently ended what was called, I think the gangland war where there were decades of gangland mafia murders and there's a huge, crazy history of mafia bullshit in Australia that I heard.

213
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,954
Speaker 0: New York recently ended decade long history of gangland wars.

214
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,908
Speaker 0: We didn't have a name recently entered the same way.

215
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:12,873
Speaker 1: the Australian one was.

216
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:25,339
Speaker 1: action was much more interesting because it was a sort of defined set of, it was kind of like a look back in history, the story of who was being murdered and why red like stories in America from the twenties.

217
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:31,440
Speaker 0: I heard that LA recently sort of mostly ended a long decade, multi-decade history of gangland wars.

218
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,467
Speaker 1: Actually, no, they didn't for one and two.

219
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,806
Speaker 1: that's different kind of gang from the kind of gangs I'm talking about.

220
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:48,854
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, I'm just saying they're two completely unrelated things, but anyway, things of the day.

221
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:55,734
Speaker 0: So I found this video of a machine that makes the day are the only things in this episode that aren't Australian.

222
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:59,029
Speaker 1: I could have found an Australian one if I tried hard enough.

223
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:02,445
Speaker 1: I didn't even think to, and I haven't uploaded any pictures from the trip yet.

224
00:12:02,727 --> 00:12:12,630
Speaker 1: This is a machine that constructs the paper airplane from a single sheet of paper and then launches it and it appears to be able to do this in rapid fashion and I thought that was really cool.

225
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,172
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

226
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:20,855
Speaker 1: But then there was a love related video and that related video was actually pretty great.

227
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:34,624
Speaker 1: Basically by this related video, I stumbled upon the community of people who is dedicated to making crazy origami paper airplanes out of single sheets of paper using no tools other than a single pencil or pen.

228
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:36,511
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew these people existed.

229
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,342
Speaker 0: I knew, I assume they never searched for them on YouTube.

230
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:49,790
Speaker 1: In fact, I interacted with them because when I was a kid, I did science Olympiad and one of the events had to do with making paper airplanes under similar constraints that would either go for distance or airtime.

231
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,045
Speaker 0: In the paper airplane contest, I almost won for most flips, but I was short by one.

232
00:12:56,091 --> 00:12:59,360
Speaker 0: Mine went up and it went, and they hit the ground.

233
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,859
Speaker 1: I made a pretty good paper airplane to compete that it was going for airtime.

234
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,802
Speaker 1: It would go up in the air and it basically kind of circle very slowly for a long time and eventually come down.

235
00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:22,870
Speaker 1: But the kid who beat me, I still don't know exactly what he made, but the airplane went up and just went across and up and then flipped over and went across the other way and up and flipped over and it did that basically forever.

236
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,936
Speaker 1: It was up so long.

237
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:28,914
Speaker 1: It was up more than double the time of any other airplane in the competition.

238
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,618
Speaker 1: It was ridiculous.

239
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,718
Speaker 1: And as soon as it ended, he walked over and he tore it up so no one could look at it.

240
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,991
Speaker 0: We should YouTube the world record for that shit.

241
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:37,861
Speaker 0: Oh wait, he tore it up so no one could look at it.

242
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:38,967
Speaker 0: Cheating.

243
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:40,173
Speaker 0: He was definitely cheating.

244
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,102
Speaker 0: He might had a paper clip on that motherfucker or something.

245
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,892
Speaker 1: No judges inspected them ahead of time.

246
00:13:43,912 --> 00:13:44,696
Speaker 1: They didn't want any.

247
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,308
Speaker 0: He could have modified it after the inspection.

248
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,032
Speaker 0: You got it.

249
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:48,433
Speaker 0: That's why F1.

250
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,805
Speaker 0: they inspect your car before and after the race.

251
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:54,001
Speaker 1: They inspect it and they hand it back to you and you have to immediately launch it.

252
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,387
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh, slate a hand.

253
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:06,707
Speaker 1: So here is someone making the 12 a BAC TSR two out of paper and it's pretty off the hook.

254
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:09,255
Speaker 1: However, warning motherfucker doesn't throw it.

255
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,026
Speaker 1: So go to this video.

256
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:31,269
Speaker 1: and if you ever doubted that there isn't a community for pretty much everything on the internet, go to this video and sometimes, you know, you'll get into the situation, you're poking around on YouTube and you hit that one video that is tied to a ghetto of the internet where from that point onward, every related video will just be related to that one thing and it's a loop from which you can never escape.

257
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,723
Speaker 0: So here's a video that is super funny and awesome.

258
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:37,192
Speaker 0: It is an MMA fight of some variety.

259
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:44,757
Speaker 0: I can't tell which one and on one corner we have a small Japanese MMA guy, maybe 160 something pounds.

260
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,444
Speaker 1: I like those kind of scrappy guys.

261
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,253
Speaker 0: You know, he's lighter.

262
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:52,431
Speaker 0: He weighs less than me, but he could definitely beat me up cause I have no strength whatsoever and my arm is broken.

263
00:14:53,456 --> 00:15:00,713
Speaker 0: And in the other corner we have Emmanuel Yarbrough who weighs over 600 pounds.

264
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,017
Speaker 0: A basically monster.

265
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:08,838
Speaker 0: Not as tall as Andre the giant, but I think he weighs more than Andre the giant did.

266
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:11,993
Speaker 1: I think that was, that's what that mediocre commentator said at one point.

267
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:14,624
Speaker 0: I think one of the commentators is Bas Rutten.

268
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:21,186
Speaker 0: I'm not sure, but Bas Rutten is not mediocre person, but the commentary was mediocre.

269
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:21,648
Speaker 1: I don't know.

270
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,312
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

271
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:26,448
Speaker 0: I've heard better kind of pretty average anyway, but yeah, you got to watch this.

272
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:27,391
Speaker 0: This is crazy.

273
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:33,168
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like rigging King Hippo or it looks like a boss fight.

274
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:34,291
Speaker 1: Attack on Titan.

275
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:34,872
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

276
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,875
Speaker 0: Attack a ton.

277
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:40,857
Speaker 1: I got to take that video and just add the attack on Titan theme to and re upload it.

278
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,002
Speaker 0: It might already have been.

279
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:44,749
Speaker 1: If it hasn't, I'm going to do that before we go to Wildwood.

280
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:45,511
Speaker 1: I'll.

281
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,537
Speaker 1: it's like a boss fight from one of those walk around and hit people.

282
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:55,114
Speaker 1: Games are like a resident evil where there's the lumbering monster in the middle.

283
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:55,797
Speaker 1: That's huge.

284
00:15:55,857 --> 00:16:01,427
Speaker 1: That is slowly coming at you and you got to keep kiting it because as soon as you stop cutting it, it just punches you and say hiding.

285
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:01,990
Speaker 0: How are you playing?

286
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,364
Speaker 1: the mob is now with that term has been around for a while.

287
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:06,307
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

288
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:06,949
Speaker 1: Yeah.

289
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,778
Speaker 1: Now I'm, I have tried the mobas.

290
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,304
Speaker 1: Don't like the mobas still.

291
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:13,455
Speaker 1: We'll talk about the mobas at some point in the future.

292
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,505
Speaker 1: Might talk about them in our bad games, panel of packs.

293
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, man met a moment in the meta moment.

294
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,394
Speaker 1: We're back from Australia and we're about to go to packs.

295
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:26,759
Speaker 1: We're on Monday at noon.

296
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,572
Speaker 1: We're going to be presenting bad games in the theater.

297
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:39,972
Speaker 0: You should probably, instead of going to bad games, there's like a Robert coup interviewing Mike and Jerry panel, which was originally scheduled as mystery panel, but then they revealed it.

298
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:42,366
Speaker 1: You know what mystery panel, you know what they're doing?

299
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:43,814
Speaker 1: They're doing the same shit.

300
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,965
Speaker 1: We used to do a kinetic on with the crab people panel.

301
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:46,607
Speaker 0: Yup.

302
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,097
Speaker 1: The, well, we can't fill this hole now.

303
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:52,813
Speaker 1: Let's assume we'll have something good to put there and we're competing with that.

304
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,320
Speaker 1: So that's fine.

305
00:16:55,943 --> 00:17:02,045
Speaker 1: Uh, I think we'll be fine because one, you guys all know what we're going to say in a bad games panel.

306
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:05,540
Speaker 1: I kind of want people who don't know who we are to show up to this thing.

307
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,464
Speaker 1: They're unlikely to cause they'll be at the anyway now cause that thing can only hold so many people.

308
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:10,711
Speaker 0: It's also Monday at noon.

309
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,099
Speaker 0: I don't know what Monday is going to be like.

310
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,507
Speaker 1: I think the whole con is sold out.

311
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:18,140
Speaker 0: So I know anyway, what else is in the meta moment?

312
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,076
Speaker 1: The book club book is very apropos to what is going on in the U S right now.

313
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:29,629
Speaker 1: And while we always assume that this shit was going down in the U S now there's evidence of it kind of mad that people aren't mad about it.

314
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,380
Speaker 1: So I hope that you guys read this and get mad.

315
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,404
Speaker 0: They weren't mad before.

316
00:17:32,444 --> 00:17:33,529
Speaker 0: Why would they be mad now?

317
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:38,531
Speaker 1: Maybe because they lack the imagination to really think about what, where this road goes.

318
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,399
Speaker 1: Cause it's not nowhere.

319
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:50,138
Speaker 1: Uh, other than that, after packs, there's going to be kind of a calm down period.

320
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,370
Speaker 1: I don't know if we'll go to the New York comic con.

321
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,476
Speaker 1: We skipped it last year.

322
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:55,185
Speaker 1: Kind of done with the New York comic con.

323
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,722
Speaker 0: There's nothing really there that I need to say, but there will be mad.

324
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:02,171
Speaker 1: I'm doing it quiet.

325
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,437
Speaker 1: Like it's too soon.

326
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,022
Speaker 0: You can hear the mag fest in the distance.

327
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,870
Speaker 0: It's out there.

328
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,914
Speaker 0: It's a few months down the road.

329
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:12,608
Speaker 1: I kind of want to make a YouTube video on how to do the mag fest.

330
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,193
Speaker 1: Roar at mag fest.

331
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:20,579
Speaker 1: Do it like video, other people doing it and make the thing because mag fest is going to be off the hook and crazy.

332
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:20,800
Speaker 1: Awesome.

333
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,462
Speaker 1: Like it always is.

334
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:22,988
Speaker 1: We will be there doing our usual thing.

335
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,537
Speaker 0: And so will so well.

336
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:26,480
Speaker 1: Oh right.

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,555
Speaker 1: Machine supremacy or you may incorrectly know them as mock and I supremacy.

338
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:39,944
Speaker 0: You may, but they have never before in the history of the universe performed music in the United States of America.

339
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:43,861
Speaker 1: If I had to say one thing to convince you to go to mag fest, it would be this.

340
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:45,707
Speaker 1: I love packs.

341
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:49,720
Speaker 1: If you can't tell Scott packs is a big part of every pack since away.

342
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,853
Speaker 1: We flew to fucking Australia to go to packs Australia.

343
00:18:53,873 --> 00:19:01,262
Speaker 0: If mag fest was at the same time as packs Australia with machine supremacy being there, I probably would not have gone to Austria.

344
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:10,088
Speaker 1: Pax aside, mag fest is the best gaming convention in the Western hemisphere and two packs Australia packs.

345
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,352
Speaker 0: You've never even been to Gen Con.

346
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:15,624
Speaker 1: Oh, mag fest has a better arcade than packs.

347
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:19,013
Speaker 1: true to a degree that is painful to behold.

348
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:19,555
Speaker 1: True.

349
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:23,087
Speaker 1: Pax has a tiny little room with some arcade machines in it.

350
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:29,153
Speaker 1: Mag fest has a football field of arcade machines and Scott will tell you, I am not exaggerating at all.

351
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:29,635
Speaker 0: It's true.

352
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:30,980
Speaker 1: It is a football field.

353
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,023
Speaker 0: 100% true.

354
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:32,585
Speaker 1: It is.

355
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,811
Speaker 1: It is ridiculous.

356
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:37,546
Speaker 1: Last year they had one of those VR machines that used to be in malls in the nineties.

357
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:38,772
Speaker 1: Just hanging out.

358
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:40,037
Speaker 1: It was just hanging out.

359
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:43,150
Speaker 1: You just fucking walk up and be like, Hey, I want to play this and be like, okay.

360
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:43,873
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:45,700
Speaker 0: Mag fest is awesome.

362
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,846
Speaker 0: You should check us.

363
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:51,694
Speaker 0: If you're listening to this podcast, you should know that we're all over the internets and all the places that are on the internets.

364
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:56,456
Speaker 0: So go to all your favorite internet places, all your social networks and our websites and all those things.

365
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,916
Speaker 0: And if you go to front row crew.com, you can have help finding those places.

366
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,149
Speaker 1: Also, we're slowly uploading videos from Connecticut and packs.

367
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,236
Speaker 0: Australia is one of those places.

368
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:23,604
Speaker 1: Lots of our old lectures are on YouTube and, and, and, and we're actually doing another show called a geek nights presents shoujo kakame Utena, where we're going through a 39 episode anime and talking about each episode for longer than the episode runs, seems to be moderately popular.

369
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:28,567
Speaker 1: And if you guys spread it around, the more views it gets, the more likely we are to do it faster.

370
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:31,620
Speaker 0: Well, we're likely to do it faster after packs prime.

371
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,975
Speaker 1: We're going to try to at least record some episodes before packs prime.

372
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,782
Speaker 1: So we'll see where that goes.

373
00:20:38,243 --> 00:20:38,564
Speaker 0: All right.

374
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,614
Speaker 0: So back to Australia, the land down under.

375
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,367
Speaker 0: There were no poison things, not anywhere near us.

376
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:46,831
Speaker 0: I didn't even see a big spider.

377
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:54,475
Speaker 1: The flight in my opinion was easier and better and more pleasant than when I fly to Mumbai.

378
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,593
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't fly to Mumbai so I can't compare because my flight to Mumbai is one shot.

379
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,620
Speaker 1: There's no layover.

380
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:07,117
Speaker 1: The layover in LA before I get on the flight to Melbourne actually really helped.

381
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,964
Speaker 0: It didn't help me that one.

382
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,602
Speaker 1: It gave me an accused to walk around a whole very annoying on the way back.

383
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,776
Speaker 0: That layover going through customs, getting my bags and putting them back.

384
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,483
Speaker 0: That was a pain in the ass.

385
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,870
Speaker 1: That was a, that was a super pain in the ass.

386
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:20,231
Speaker 0: Yeah.

387
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:27,712
Speaker 1: But two because the time zone change is pretty much the other side of the world.

388
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:29,557
Speaker 1: Zero jet lag.

389
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:42,263
Speaker 1: Well, literally I woke up, you know, on the plane and had breakfast and then we got out of the airport and it was like late morning, early afternoon in Melbourne on Thursday and I was fine around 10 o'clock.

390
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:47,045
Speaker 1: I was like, let's go to bed, went to sleep, woke up the next morning and I was in Australia time.

391
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:47,467
Speaker 1: Yeah.

392
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:57,491
Speaker 0: I mean, I set my watch when I got on the plane to Australia time and then the plane seemed to be operating on Australia time cause they gave us dinner like right away when it was dinner time in Australia.

393
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:58,255
Speaker 1: That's the secret.

394
00:21:58,396 --> 00:22:00,166
Speaker 1: And I tweeted this in a bunch of people.

395
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:03,424
Speaker 0: I even tweeted and then they gave us breakfast during his breakfast time in Australia.

396
00:22:03,605 --> 00:22:08,665
Speaker 1: All of you who experienced jet lag, I have so simple advice that will save you.

397
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,136
Speaker 1: Do whatever the plane is telling you to do.

398
00:22:11,176 --> 00:22:12,784
Speaker 1: The airlines have this shit figured out.

399
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:13,005
Speaker 1: Yeah.

400
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:19,634
Speaker 0: And then like after dinner I did some stuff for a little bit and then I went to bed and then I woke up and it was breakfast.

401
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:21,562
Speaker 1: You're on a plane and they serve dinner.

402
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:21,944
Speaker 1: Eat it.

403
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,396
Speaker 1: No matter what, if they bring you food, eat all of it.

404
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:27,754
Speaker 1: If they ask you if you want water, you say yes, you drink that goddamn water.

405
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,564
Speaker 1: If the lights are on, you stay awake.

406
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:31,073
Speaker 1: If the lights are off, you go to sleep.

407
00:22:31,094 --> 00:22:32,743
Speaker 0: They made everyone close all the windows.

408
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:34,514
Speaker 0: They didn't let you control your little plane window.

409
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:37,108
Speaker 1: If the lights go off and you can't sleep, close your eyes.

410
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,195
Speaker 1: Just lay there anyway.

411
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:38,818
Speaker 0: That's what I did.

412
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:42,071
Speaker 0: I was because even though I could sleep, I was tired.

413
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:46,246
Speaker 0: I basically have trouble sleeping, sitting up, even reclining the stupid.

414
00:22:46,266 --> 00:22:48,232
Speaker 1: I have no trouble with that reclining chair.

415
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:49,095
Speaker 0: Thank glob.

416
00:22:50,519 --> 00:23:01,344
Speaker 0: So I was just sort of, you know, uncomfortably drifting in and out, but that was, you know, it was shitty sleep, but it was sleep and I was rested when we landed and I did the same thing on the way back.

417
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:03,595
Speaker 1: So Melbourne airport, whatever, all normal.

418
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,466
Speaker 0: It's the first time for their gigantic duty free.

419
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:09,437
Speaker 1: Uh, that was not a gigantic duty.

420
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,064
Speaker 0: That's the biggest duty free I've ever seen.

421
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,354
Speaker 1: That was an average size duty free.

422
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:18,400
Speaker 0: It was like they make you, as you're walking to the gate, you have to go through this incredible duty free like Wonderland.

423
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:19,262
Speaker 1: Yeah.

424
00:23:19,403 --> 00:23:23,594
Speaker 1: Fly through a Tokyo or something sometime or go to Istanbul.

425
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:24,276
Speaker 0: Okay.

426
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:28,129
Speaker 0: But it's like, why would anyone buy this full priced garbage?

427
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,284
Speaker 1: So we landed and we got a bunch of Australian money from an ATM.

428
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:33,971
Speaker 0: Australian money is awesome.

429
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,598
Speaker 1: Australian money is the best one.

430
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:39,008
Speaker 1: The default bill is the 50 not the 20 to.

431
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:43,362
Speaker 0: the bills are different colors and different sizes for blind people.

432
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:43,684
Speaker 1: Three.

433
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:50,471
Speaker 1: They have a really cool, clear part on them and every vending machine and everything takes cash and it just works every time.

434
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 1: The coins are great because they don't have pennies and while they're not having pennies is great, but the coins are flawed.

435
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,266
Speaker 1: I don't think they're flawed.

436
00:23:58,488 --> 00:23:58,890
Speaker 0: They're okay.

437
00:23:58,911 --> 00:23:59,696
Speaker 0: So here's the one thing, right?

438
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:01,526
Speaker 1: I think they're in fact the opposite.

439
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:05,505
Speaker 0: It's good that the gold money is worth something and the silver money isn't right.

440
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,520
Speaker 0: So you can easily separate worthwhile money from unworthwhile money.

441
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,953
Speaker 0: But why is the $2 coins smaller than the $1?

442
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:12,796
Speaker 0: easily?

443
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:16,450
Speaker 1: Because you're going to carry a lot more one and $2 coins around because they're useful.

444
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,663
Speaker 1: I need any big coins that you get by accident.

445
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,094
Speaker 1: You leave his tip the next chance you get.

446
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:25,025
Speaker 0: But I'm saying, why were the twos smaller than the one?

447
00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:34,085
Speaker 1: Because you're going to carry more of them than you are ones because that they're, that the smallest bill is a five and they don't even seem to ever give you fives and change.

448
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,916
Speaker 1: They just give you a pile of those coins and you know what?

449
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:39,698
Speaker 1: I did an audit of my pockets because this is an issue that really bothers me.

450
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:40,160
Speaker 1: The fact that the?

451
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,963
Speaker 1: u s still has pennies.

452
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:50,717
Speaker 1: One, I noted that pretty much because tax is already included and everything, prices are proud into the nearest dollar pretty much everywhere.

453
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,866
Speaker 1: Maybe the nearest 50 cents.

454
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,574
Speaker 0: There was one or two times or something.

455
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,006
Speaker 0: It was like nine 95 and I was seriously 95.

456
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,854
Speaker 0: I haven't seen that in this country anywhere.

457
00:24:59,095 --> 00:24:59,316
Speaker 0: Yes.

458
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,768
Speaker 1: I almost never saw, I got maybe three or four nickels.

459
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:04,433
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, the tax is built in.

460
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:08,571
Speaker 0: So I got a nickel and change and I was like, really?

461
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:08,812
Speaker 1: Yeah.

462
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:09,999
Speaker 1: Those are the only times they got nickels.

463
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,963
Speaker 1: But my car, my pockets had fewer coins in them on average that were annoying than I have in the u s.

464
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:23,935
Speaker 0: I had a lot of coins in my pockets that were annoying, but I then I would just dump them all out because they were these worthless silver coins.

465
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:27,189
Speaker 1: I didn't get a lot of those silver coins because I left them for tips everywhere.

466
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:39,074
Speaker 1: Anyway, the $2 coin, the u s should get rid of the one and $2 bill, replace them in one and $2 coins, get rid of the quarter and replace it with the much superior 20 cent coin.

467
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:41,624
Speaker 1: That 20 cent coin was so much better.

468
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:45,078
Speaker 0: I didn't use any, any silver coin at any point to pay for anything.

469
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,904
Speaker 1: I use my 50 cent coins a lot too.

470
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,737
Speaker 0: I took a stack of 50 cent coins and use them to buy.

471
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,154
Speaker 0: Uh, they came out to a bunch of dollars when I was at the base.

472
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:57,551
Speaker 0: I put all those useless coins in a bag and I took them with me home.

473
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:02,853
Speaker 0: And when I was at the airport about to leave, I took all the big 50 cent coins and bought like two candy bars.

474
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,566
Speaker 0: And I was like, Oh, got rid of those big fuckers.

475
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:16,152
Speaker 1: So we got out of the airport, we check in our hotel, we wander around Melbourne and we decide that we want to get some food and we walk around.

476
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:24,388
Speaker 1: And the of meat raft in pastry bread.

477
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,092
Speaker 0: That was most of the food.

478
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,817
Speaker 0: That was the default food.

479
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:27,918
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,992
Speaker 1: The secondary default food was the sandwich.

481
00:26:32,032 --> 00:26:37,616
Speaker 1: And I got to tell you, we live in New York, which is while not the king of submarine sandwiches, cause we don't have them.

482
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:40,028
Speaker 0: The king of other sandwiches, normal sandwiches.

483
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,991
Speaker 1: New York was until this point, the king, but Australia or at least Melbourne, my hat is off to you.

484
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:45,734
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

485
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:49,692
Speaker 0: So if you're talking like Carnegie deli, it's like, no, my hat is not off to you.

486
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,260
Speaker 0: You didn't have a competition for that.

487
00:26:51,380 --> 00:27:00,517
Speaker 0: But if you're talking about the average place, right, you just walk into a deli or a cafe and they have that little refer display case refrigerator that has sandwiches in it.

488
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:09,478
Speaker 0: Usually in New York, when you go to one of those places that has a display case refrigerator with sandwiches in it, it's all the same paninis, the same wraps, the same sandwiches.

489
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:13,092
Speaker 0: They all look really bland and mediocre.

490
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,417
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, I could eat that.

491
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:15,340
Speaker 0: It won't poison me.

492
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,777
Speaker 0: It will taste fine, but it is not something I want or would actively seek out.

493
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:20,600
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

494
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,403
Speaker 1: I ate way.

495
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,854
Speaker 1: I had a lot of sandwiches just because they look so good.

496
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:30,623
Speaker 0: Almost every place I saw with the display case, refrigerator had sandwiches that were obviously made at that place.

497
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:37,150
Speaker 0: They were using a high quality bread and high quality ingredients and a clever and interesting flavorful combination.

498
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:39,500
Speaker 1: Those sandwiches were so good, but they got nothing.

499
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:47,070
Speaker 1: They looked like restaurant presentable, but I didn't eat as many of them as I wanted to because I kept getting meat pies instead.

500
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,720
Speaker 0: I ate, tried to eat a nice mix of things.

501
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:53,032
Speaker 1: But I got different kinds of meat pies and I was amazed.

502
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:55,240
Speaker 0: I had a curry one and I had a lamb.

503
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,764
Speaker 1: There were pasties.

504
00:27:56,784 --> 00:28:12,211
Speaker 1: I vote the pasties seem to exist in a small number of places in the world, a small number of places in the United Kingdom, Albion, the Northern upper peninsula of Michigan, and apparently all of Eastern Australia.

505
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:13,535
Speaker 1: pasties.

506
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:14,197
Speaker 1: Look them up.

507
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:14,839
Speaker 1: They're delicious.

508
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,772
Speaker 1: You might've heard of them in Neil Gaiman's, uh, American gods.

509
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:19,560
Speaker 1: That's where most people seem to learn.

510
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,503
Speaker 1: the pasties exist.

511
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:25,399
Speaker 1: But, uh, all that food stuff aside, we decided to eat at this pub.

512
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:26,545
Speaker 1: They're like, Oh, we'll get some pub food.

513
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:27,349
Speaker 1: And there was this prefix.

514
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:27,992
Speaker 1: that looked pretty good.

515
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,766
Speaker 1: And this is when our adventure began.

516
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:34,042
Speaker 1: This was the first point where we ran into culture that was different from our own.

517
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:36,791
Speaker 1: There was a surreal experience.

518
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:40,484
Speaker 1: We only had one other surreal experience the whole time we were in this country.

519
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:46,302
Speaker 1: So we go into this pub and we walk in and it's not really clear where to go.

520
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:48,414
Speaker 1: There's like a bar area and there's some people hanging out.

521
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,166
Speaker 0: Well, it's sort of a weird in between lunch and dinner time.

522
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:51,588
Speaker 0: Yep.

523
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,460
Speaker 1: But there was a prefix thing like advertised outside.

524
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,667
Speaker 1: It was pretty cheap and it looked good.

525
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:58,021
Speaker 1: It was like pub food, like bangers and mash and that kind of stuff.

526
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:01,695
Speaker 1: And we kind of look around and go, there's one bartender.

527
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,100
Speaker 1: So like, yeah, how do we get food?

528
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,892
Speaker 1: And she's like, Oh, you can sit up here or you can sit downstairs.

529
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:11,840
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, so go to the middle floor where it seems like there's an actual restaurant and it's basically dark and closed.

530
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:15,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, we go even lower and it's a basically, it's really a bar.

531
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:19,090
Speaker 1: There's just a bar down there and there's a bunch of guys hanging out with the bartender.

532
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:25,333
Speaker 0: It was so stereotypical, like a thing you would see on TV, like people hanging out behind around the bar, talking wise.

533
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:33,357
Speaker 1: This is a weekday during the day after lunchtime, but long before anyone gets off work.

534
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:40,525
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of guys like 10 of them just hanging out, doing basically reenacting a scene from a movie that would be going on in the background.

535
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:45,725
Speaker 1: So kind of walk in and they all stop and look at us like, and then they go back to their business.

536
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:47,091
Speaker 1: We sit down for a while.

537
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,401
Speaker 1: It's not obvious how to order food.

538
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:49,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

539
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:53,278
Speaker 0: They asked us like, you know, we're like, should we go upstairs?

540
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,309
Speaker 0: Like, well, you shouldn't go to the middle cause that's closed.

541
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:56,234
Speaker 0: They're like, all right.

542
00:29:56,676 --> 00:30:00,757
Speaker 0: So you sit down at a table and no one really talks to us or anything and North tries to serve us.

543
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:02,465
Speaker 0: So like, Oh yes, this isn't how you get food.

544
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:02,928
Speaker 1: Yup.

545
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,154
Speaker 1: There were no menus or anything.

546
00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:11,060
Speaker 1: So eventually we just kind of walk back upstairs and go to the regular part and we'd go to the bartender and ask for food.

547
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,507
Speaker 0: Cause no one came to ask us.

548
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:12,890
Speaker 0: Yup.

549
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,136
Speaker 1: And then after that it was fine.

550
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:15,222
Speaker 1: So we get our good food, we're eating it.

551
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:20,827
Speaker 1: There's people hanging out and there's a mix of people in this bar, like a surprising panoply of people.

552
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:32,739
Speaker 1: And then a panoply, a gentleman, not a panoply, a gentleman, an elderly gentleman where dressed in that sort of shabby but fine way.

553
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,293
Speaker 1: Like he was wearing fine clothes that just looked like they were kind of old and worn out.

554
00:30:37,298 --> 00:30:42,338
Speaker 1: And you're wearing like a jacket and he walks in and he bows to everyone and sits down at the piano.

555
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:45,150
Speaker 1: that's there and just starts singing the kind of song.

556
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,603
Speaker 0: Well he asked the bartender if he could play the piano, if it would be all right.

557
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:48,964
Speaker 1: Yup.

558
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,590
Speaker 1: And she was like, you know, no worries.

559
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,036
Speaker 1: Go for it.

560
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:59,400
Speaker 1: And he just starts playing at the piano and then he sings what I can only describe as a British pub song.

561
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:02,251
Speaker 0: I don't even remember the song, but it was weird.

562
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:09,201
Speaker 1: It was one of those songs that like you'd expect someone to sing and a bunch of people are singing along with them around a piano in a movie from the twenties.

563
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:14,158
Speaker 1: And then he stops playing and he gets up, bows to everyone and just walks out.

564
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:22,682
Speaker 0: He said something to us about like, you know, he was like a performer and his stage is the street or something like that.

565
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,949
Speaker 1: He kind of sounded like James Mason.

566
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:28,882
Speaker 0: He was, you know, a weird eccentric kind of guy.

567
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:32,754
Speaker 1: And all this just kind of happened while we were trying to get lunch in this pub.

568
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:41,565
Speaker 1: And then we get our meal, we leave like a $20 tip and we go to walk out and the bartender's like, Whoa, what are you guys doing?

569
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:42,229
Speaker 0: Come back here.

570
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:42,872
Speaker 0: We're like, what?

571
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,240
Speaker 1: There's no tipping in this country.

572
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,524
Speaker 1: I am paid very well.

573
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:46,247
Speaker 0: Yeah.

574
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,478
Speaker 0: Apparently ever the minimum wage is really good there.

575
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:49,779
Speaker 1: Yeah.

576
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:52,691
Speaker 1: For service people it's like 20, 25 bucks an hour.

577
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,519
Speaker 0: Well, it's a bit, you know, it varies.

578
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,410
Speaker 1: service like, like that kind of hospitality.

579
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,334
Speaker 0: It's some number.

580
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,888
Speaker 0: Apparently it goes, it can be like, if you're a high school kid, it can be way low, like $8.

581
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:10,990
Speaker 0: And if you're, you know, have, you know, as if you have more and more years of working, it goes up and up and it can be like, I think it's around 16, $18, something like that.

582
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,388
Speaker 1: But it seems like all the bartenders and waiters and people make 20, 25 bucks an hour.

583
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:15,669
Speaker 0: Yeah.

584
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,462
Speaker 0: People are getting paid real money there, so they don't need your tip.

585
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:22,801
Speaker 0: And there's also things like reward wages, which I still can't figure out what those are.

586
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:26,295
Speaker 1: And also they were almost as complicated as the Mikey card.

587
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:26,435
Speaker 0: Yeah.

588
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:34,145
Speaker 0: There's also concessions, which is like, if you, I guess if you're old or infirm or concessions, I figured out pretty quick were oldenings.

589
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:34,828
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,651
Speaker 0: It's, you know, social security or something, but it's like, they would always be on everything, but have concession prices.

591
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,340
Speaker 0: It'd be like, Oh, you want to buy this?

592
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,564
Speaker 0: It costs 10 bucks.

593
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,110
Speaker 0: concessions, six bucks.

594
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:50,436
Speaker 0: And it's like, what old people just, you know, seniors, it's like senior citizen discount, social security, et cetera.

595
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:51,682
Speaker 1: This is why I said the money is fine.

596
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:52,566
Speaker 1: Cause what did she say?

597
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:55,460
Speaker 1: She said, you leave a tip of pretty much all your silver money.

598
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:58,755
Speaker 1: So all your 50 cent and 20 cent coins, you just leave them.

600
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,242
Speaker 1: And that's, that's the tip you leave.

601
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:04,000
Speaker 1: And while we're standing there, this old gentleman at the bar is like, Americans, eh?

602
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,271
Speaker 1: And we're like, you couldn't tell from our accent.

603
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,180
Speaker 0: He was like, you'll give yourself away.

604
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:10,753
Speaker 0: tipping like that is for tourists tipping like that.

605
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,723
Speaker 0: I'm like, Oh, our accents won't give us away.

606
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:16,200
Speaker 1: And then we were like, so what's the, what's the only thing we could do to offend people here?

607
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,557
Speaker 1: And there were, and the guy was basically like, try to do an Australian accent.

608
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:20,421
Speaker 0: That's not how it was.

609
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:21,968
Speaker 0: I said, what should I do?

610
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:23,534
Speaker 0: Should I fake an Australian accent?

611
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:25,402
Speaker 0: And he was like, no, no, no, no, no.

612
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:25,824
Speaker 0: Good day.

613
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:26,125
Speaker 1: Good day.

614
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:26,367
Speaker 1: Good day.

615
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:26,608
Speaker 1: Good day.

616
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:27,050
Speaker 1: Good day.

617
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,371
Speaker 1: Good day.

618
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:27,874
Speaker 1: Yeah.

619
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:28,476
Speaker 1: Good on you.

620
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:29,862
Speaker 0: You know, whatever.

621
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:31,067
Speaker 0: I never heard anyone say that.

622
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:32,815
Speaker 1: I heard several people say it.

623
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:35,145
Speaker 1: Enforcers seem to be saying it a lot.

624
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,491
Speaker 0: They would say no worries.

625
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:37,596
Speaker 1: That's got to be like, Oh, don't worry.

626
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:38,280
Speaker 1: I got this up.

627
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,083
Speaker 1: And they gotta be like it on you.

628
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:44,309
Speaker 1: I helped, uh, I helped coo move a chair at one point just cause he was trying to move a chair and he couldn't get it unlocked.

629
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:47,105
Speaker 1: And some enforcer came over and like was trying to help too.

630
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:48,415
Speaker 1: And he saw me and he was like, Oh, good on you.

631
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:49,079
Speaker 1: And then he walked away.

632
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,081
Speaker 1: Yeah.

633
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:57,488
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah, then we went to packs, then we went to bags, bags, bags, bags, bags, well, no way you missed a very important part.

634
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:02,393
Speaker 0: So we spent the other part of that day walking around, just walking around the city, walking around, looking around.

635
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:06,991
Speaker 1: Scott almost got hit by a car immediately because he looked right instead of left to jaywalk.

636
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,674
Speaker 0: That happens.

637
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:11,387
Speaker 1: Also, people don't really jaywalk in Melbourne.

638
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:17,387
Speaker 1: And the reason for this is because cars are actually going pretty fucking fast there because traffic's not that bad.

639
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:22,164
Speaker 0: And also the street lights does super help for the blind there.

640
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,130
Speaker 0: So like if I'm blind, I'm moving there.

641
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:29,654
Speaker 0: Cause every street, like the buttons to tell you when to cross and the lights and the Tokyo's like that.

642
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:30,337
Speaker 1: So is Istanbul.

643
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:30,759
Speaker 0: All right.

644
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,063
Speaker 0: The bumps on the sidewalk.

645
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:32,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:33,770
Speaker 0: Way better than in New York.

647
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,396
Speaker 1: So is fucking Mumbai.

648
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:42,402
Speaker 0: But I got way used to it because I was busy using the noise to tell me when to cross the street and not the lights.

649
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,197
Speaker 0: And I was worried that I would get messed up when I came back to New York.

650
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:49,739
Speaker 1: I realized the reason I wouldn't mess this up is because we don't look at the lights in the U S either.

651
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,382
Speaker 0: That's right.

652
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:53,715
Speaker 1: But yeah, you can't, it's actually kind of dangerous to jaywalk.

653
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:58,816
Speaker 0: Also there's trams like actual trends, all these pictures everywhere that you're like rhinoceroses.

654
00:34:58,836 --> 00:34:59,719
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

655
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,006
Speaker 1: That rhino picture was the best.

656
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:05,006
Speaker 0: And it's basically trying to say like, look, the tram weighs as much as like a bunch of rhinos.

657
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,110
Speaker 0: Don't get hit by it.

658
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:07,294
Speaker 1: Yeah.

659
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:11,049
Speaker 1: So mass transit in Melbourne, they don't have a subway, which kind of sort of did.

660
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,077
Speaker 1: The subway has five stations.

661
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:17,295
Speaker 0: It's basically, from what I could tell, it wasn't used because they're building it right now.

662
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:17,657
Speaker 1: Yeah.

663
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:21,214
Speaker 1: It's supposed, it's going to connect all the major transit centers inside of the city, apparently.

664
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:24,647
Speaker 1: And they've got light rail and they've got trams.

665
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,618
Speaker 1: The trams do not replace subways of New York.

666
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,686
Speaker 1: had these trams into the subways to have those trams.

667
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:31,187
Speaker 1: Yes.

668
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:37,846
Speaker 1: Those trams, each tram in a fully loaded situation holds fewer people than one subway car.

669
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:38,307
Speaker 0: Correct.

670
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,061
Speaker 1: But they run pretty much constantly and they're really good.

671
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:46,916
Speaker 1: My take on these trams is that they do not replace real mass transit.

672
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:53,595
Speaker 1: New York needs the subway, but they augment mass transit because they replace walking.

673
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:54,136
Speaker 0: Right.

674
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:59,797
Speaker 0: So a lot of times, so for example, the S subway that could be replaced by a tram, right?

675
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:02,429
Speaker 0: You know, it's the, you can just cross town walking.

676
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:08,014
Speaker 0: So it's like if you're walking and you have to walk three blocks from the subway station to a place, well you would start walking.

677
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:12,112
Speaker 0: And if a tram happened to pass, you would get on it and then it would take you the rest of the way.

678
00:36:12,132 --> 00:36:18,474
Speaker 0: And I think, you know, based on another piece of evidence, everyone there walked really slow.

679
00:36:18,494 --> 00:36:18,895
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

680
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:19,557
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

681
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,608
Speaker 1: You people walk slower than Tennesseans.

682
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:23,251
Speaker 0: Right.

683
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:33,801
Speaker 0: So the fact that they walk so slow, I think is because the tram is augmenting their walking or as New Yorkers walk fast because we don't have a train.

684
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,146
Speaker 1: Just about anything.

685
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:50,829
Speaker 1: If New York city implemented trams going cross town in Manhattan only just back and forth 24 seven and in that nebulous area between Queens and Brooklyn, like that area, if there were trams just going up and down every street there, that would make New York city the best ever beyond

686
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:51,592
Speaker 0: what it already is.

687
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:56,280
Speaker 0: You know what would be so great about that is they see all the slow people would get on those and I would walk and the sidewalk could be empty.

688
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,081
Speaker 1: Yeah.

689
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,530
Speaker 0: So I could get there even faster just by walking.

690
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:09,468
Speaker 1: So we wanted to use the tram and we'd been warned ahead of time that you can't like, it's not like New York where there's a thing to buy a Metro card in every subway station.

691
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:16,390
Speaker 1: You can't buy Mikey cards basically anywhere you could get on a tram or a train.

692
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:22,149
Speaker 0: There were a couple of tram stations that had the machine, but not many in seven 11.

693
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:22,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

694
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,880
Speaker 0: You buy them in seven 11 or you buy them at like the huge stations.

695
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:39,538
Speaker 1: Now I thought, because I have an anecdote from our friend Adam where, you know, he had a friend from New York that has a real subway system and that friend was visiting him in DC and he told him, take the red line to station named X. And the friend was like, what do you mean?

696
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,566
Speaker 1: red line, like uptown downtown?

697
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:42,410
Speaker 1: What, like, what?

698
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:43,816
Speaker 1: And I was like, are you seriously?

699
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:44,640
Speaker 1: You're from New York.

700
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:50,303
Speaker 1: If you look at a map at any station in DC, it will look like the New York subway map drawn with crayons.

701
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:51,086
Speaker 1: You'll figure it out.

702
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:54,860
Speaker 0: The DC Metro is Fisher Price first subway.

703
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,244
Speaker 1: Baby's first subway.

704
00:37:57,928 --> 00:38:00,917
Speaker 1: So I figured, and Scott also figured we're New Yorkers.

705
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:02,822
Speaker 1: I'm looking at my Metro card right now.

706
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:09,240
Speaker 1: How hard can this other modern urban centers transit system be to figure out?

707
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,503
Speaker 1: And we stood there.

708
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:13,855
Speaker 0: I still don't 100% know all the rules of it.

709
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:16,525
Speaker 1: I feel like sometimes I should touch off, but not always.

710
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:17,148
Speaker 0: Right.

711
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:18,473
Speaker 0: So here's the deal with it, right?

712
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:22,209
Speaker 0: Is they've sort of done something that the New York didn't do in New York.

713
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,783
Speaker 0: A Metro card will only get you on a bus or a subway.

714
00:38:24,863 --> 00:38:26,612
Speaker 1: It won't get you on Metro North, the light rail.

715
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:29,022
Speaker 1: It won't get you on special express bus.

716
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:30,247
Speaker 0: It won't get you on the path.

717
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:31,752
Speaker 0: It won't get you on air train.

718
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:32,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't.

719
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:38,040
Speaker 0: Well, it will get you on air train, but only if you have dollars, not if you have infinite swipes.

720
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,035
Speaker 1: Now they gave you a way to put dollars on an infinite swipe card.

721
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:41,376
Speaker 0: Did they?

722
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:41,758
Speaker 0: Yeah.

723
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,141
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

724
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,294
Speaker 1: that's putting an infinite swipe card and you can add cash to it.

725
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:44,777
Speaker 0: Oh, nice.

726
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:45,341
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

727
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:45,582
Speaker 0: All right.

728
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:50,562
Speaker 0: So, but anyway, uh, but yeah, in New York, you don't use the Metro card for everything.

729
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:52,271
Speaker 0: You just use it for a certain set of things.

730
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:55,187
Speaker 0: And because you only use it for a certain set of things, it's really simple.

731
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:56,795
Speaker 0: You swipe it and you're in the system.

732
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,870
Speaker 0: You can now ride as much as you want until you leave the system.

733
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,909
Speaker 0: If you want to get back into the subway, you swipe, and it's always the same price to swipe.

734
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:07,224
Speaker 0: And no matter how far you go, no matter where you go, it's just pay to get in.

735
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:09,573
Speaker 0: And when you leave, you pay to get back in.

736
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:12,244
Speaker 1: Now I'm reasonably okay with the alternate system.

737
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:16,943
Speaker 1: Some cities have a, you put your card in, you go in and then you swipe again on your way out.

738
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:17,585
Speaker 0: Yup.

739
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,892
Speaker 0: Like DC Metro, you put a ticket in the thing.

740
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:20,975
Speaker 0: It lets you in.

741
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:23,746
Speaker 0: then on your way out, you can't get out.

742
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:24,892
Speaker 0: You put your ticket in the thing.

743
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:26,580
Speaker 0: It sucks it in and it lets you out.

744
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,453
Speaker 0: So it's, it's, you can't not figure out how it works.

745
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:34,752
Speaker 0: You buy a ticket to where you're going and the turnstiles force you to obey the system.

746
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,437
Speaker 1: So we stare at this thing.

747
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:38,403
Speaker 1: We can't figure it out for the life of us.

748
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:41,635
Speaker 0: So finally is Mikey pass and Mikey cash.

749
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:43,683
Speaker 1: I know when I go to a machine, I'm like, all right.

750
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:44,827
Speaker 1: And it gave me two options.

751
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:46,875
Speaker 1: Top up my Mikey card.

752
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:50,727
Speaker 1: I didn't have a Mikey card yet or buy a Mikey pass.

753
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,899
Speaker 1: And it was obvious I didn't want the Mikey pass, but I hit.

754
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,927
Speaker 1: top up, but I didn't have a Mikey card to put in.

755
00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:00,000
Speaker 1: So we went to this hub in the main train station.

756
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:03,350
Speaker 1: We were staying right across from a Southern cross.

757
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:07,103
Speaker 1: I was thinking about a dimension century Southern cross.

758
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:13,764
Speaker 1: I was thinking of that every time we walked past entered or exited that station or so 10, no Ken.

759
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:19,242
Speaker 1: So we go into this PT hub, which is like the place where tourists and people can get help.

760
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,012
Speaker 1: And one, there were other people in there.

761
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:28,923
Speaker 1: Some of whom were native Melburnians, or at least Australians there for packs who themselves could not figure out the fucking Mikey card.

762
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:30,449
Speaker 1: Apparently it's relatively new.

763
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,674
Speaker 1: Yeah.

764
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:32,598
Speaker 0: Here's how it works is?

765
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:41,593
Speaker 0: it's basically, it's a card you use to go anywhere, any kind of the transportation, the trams, the trains, the trains that go really far, the trains that don't go so far.

766
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,224
Speaker 0: They all use the Mikey card, fucking everything uses it.

767
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:49,002
Speaker 0: So because everything uses it, but not everything is the same price, right?

768
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,854
Speaker 0: They have to actually sort of gauge it differently.

769
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:55,369
Speaker 0: So from what I could tell is we never left zone one, zone one is the city.

770
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:59,706
Speaker 1: It was possible to leave zone one because there's like three tram stops that are outside of.

771
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:02,836
Speaker 0: zone two is commuting, right?

772
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:03,960
Speaker 0: So we weren't going anywhere.

773
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,545
Speaker 0: Commuters are from in the suburbs.

774
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,870
Speaker 0: So we were in zone one.

775
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:15,397
Speaker 0: So in zone one, we paid three 50 to the Australian dollars to, to go around for a two hour time limit.

776
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:16,722
Speaker 0: We could do as much as we wanted.

777
00:41:16,762 --> 00:41:19,535
Speaker 0: And then it would automatically sort of undo us after two hours.

778
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,749
Speaker 0: And then we would pay three 50 for another two hours, but there was a limit of $7 a day.

779
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:32,495
Speaker 0: So once we paid $7 a day, we could go around in zone one, unlimitedly on pretty much anything.

780
00:41:32,776 --> 00:41:36,010
Speaker 1: Now you can touch on, which is like swiping to get on a swipe.

781
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,882
Speaker 0: You just sort of hold it near the thing and you can touch off when you get off.

782
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:46,024
Speaker 1: But people we talked to kept giving us different advice on when you should and should not touch off.

783
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:46,928
Speaker 0: I saw Australia.

784
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:48,194
Speaker 0: It's it's an honor system.

785
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:49,218
Speaker 0: It wasn't a turnstile.

786
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,730
Speaker 0: So I saw people getting on and getting off without doing anything.

787
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:58,160
Speaker 0: I saw people religiously tapping, touching on and off at every single, I saw most people touched on, but did not touch off.

788
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:06,897
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of people doing that, but someone else told me, yeah, you should touch off because if you don't, then it assumes you went the farthest you could possibly go.

789
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:10,272
Speaker 1: I had another person tell me that you shouldn't always touch off.

790
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:13,869
Speaker 1: And he tried to give me all these examples of times when touching off costs you more money.

791
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:14,552
Speaker 0: Yeah.

792
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:20,280
Speaker 1: And like, I went to refill my Mikey card at one point and it showed that I was still touched on somewhere, I guess.

793
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:23,650
Speaker 1: I really never quite understood it.

794
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:33,447
Speaker 1: And, uh, by the end of the trip, because I'd been using it sub optimally, I ran out my money and I kinda just kept riding for the rest of the day without paying money without paying more money.

795
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,074
Speaker 0: I think I had like $3 left.

796
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:37,784
Speaker 1: I didn't balance of negative $3 on mine.

797
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:39,108
Speaker 0: I didn't know you can get to negative.

798
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:46,996
Speaker 1: It appears that once you go over the first time, it says, instead of like touched on, it says like top up your Mikey card.

799
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:48,762
Speaker 1: So I guess they give you a credit.

800
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:55,344
Speaker 0: So then if you try to fill that card, you would have to put in the money and even more money.

801
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:55,605
Speaker 0: Yep.

802
00:42:55,726 --> 00:42:57,493
Speaker 1: And it costs money for the Mikey cards.

803
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:58,738
Speaker 0: Cards are anonymous.

804
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:02,734
Speaker 1: So why not just throw the card out because it costs $6 to get a new card.

805
00:43:02,835 --> 00:43:03,959
Speaker 0: So just go for credit.

806
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,682
Speaker 0: Oh, blower than $6.

807
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:11,304
Speaker 1: I think the maximum credit you could get is like $3 and change because you touched on once.

808
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:13,853
Speaker 0: So you're better off refilling it than buying a new one.

809
00:43:14,034 --> 00:43:14,777
Speaker 0: Yeah.

810
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:15,620
Speaker 1: Clever girl.

811
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,393
Speaker 0: So yeah, we steal someone else's card from the ground.

812
00:43:18,573 --> 00:43:29,196
Speaker 0: Point is we couldn't figure it out and neither could most of the Australians we talked to, but they did tell us that apparently even the Mikey system as messed up as it was, was still better than other cities.

813
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:36,267
Speaker 0: Like they told me that in Sydney, you have to buy a paper ticket for everything to go from point a to point B con like everything is Metro North or whatever.

814
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:37,231
Speaker 0: And that's not good.

815
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,717
Speaker 1: Istanbul is plastic tokens.

816
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:39,460
Speaker 0: That's cool.

817
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:39,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:40,727
Speaker 0: I like that.

819
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:41,854
Speaker 1: That's because you buy tokens.

820
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:42,478
Speaker 1: They were super cheap.

821
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:45,732
Speaker 0: It's like, that's like the old New York city tolls used to have tone.

822
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:46,797
Speaker 1: I kept a couple of them.

823
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:50,212
Speaker 1: It basically costs like a quarter to ride the subway in Istanbul.

824
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:53,469
Speaker 0: The thing with the toll tokens is like, if you had a token, it'd be like easy pass.

825
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,164
Speaker 0: You drive up, you throw one token and you drive, you keep going forward.

826
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:57,050
Speaker 0: You don't have to make change.

827
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:05,570
Speaker 0: But if you needed to buy tokens, you basically stop at the toll hand, the guy at 20, he would give you like a fistful of tokens in a role, and then you would drive away.

828
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,839
Speaker 0: And that would be cause long lines of the tolls.

829
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,945
Speaker 0: Easy passes way better.

830
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:11,175
Speaker 0: They had an easy pass kind of system there.

831
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,043
Speaker 0: It was just called something else like E tag.

832
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:13,646
Speaker 0: It worked.

833
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:17,767
Speaker 0: I think it made a little noise whenever it charged you money and they didn't actually have like booths.

834
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:19,800
Speaker 0: It just sort of charged you money as you went down the highway.

835
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:23,115
Speaker 1: So the trams worked fine as like local mass transit.

836
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:25,283
Speaker 1: We used them the whole time and they were pretty much great.

837
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,309
Speaker 1: It was nice being in a modern city.

838
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:30,018
Speaker 1: I skip around a bit food.

839
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:44,753
Speaker 1: It was interesting that food, so Asian food, there is a Chinatown in Melbourne, which was about one third Japanese, one third Chinese, one third Korean, but then interspersed around all of those zones was pretty much every other Asian nation.

840
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:45,255
Speaker 0: Yeah.

841
00:44:45,356 --> 00:44:49,417
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of Asian stuff there cause it's really close to Asia and there's a lot of Asian people there.

842
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:49,658
Speaker 1: Yep.

843
00:44:49,939 --> 00:45:01,925
Speaker 0: And we noticed that there were teppanyaki and hibachi restaurants and they were actually called teppanyaki and hibachi appropriately as opposed to the U S where everything is called hibachi, even if it is teppanyaki.

844
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:02,186
Speaker 1: Yup.

845
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:13,127
Speaker 1: So we decided one night that we haven't had teppanyaki in a long as we Googled for the best teppanyaki in the city of Melbourne and we went to it and it was really expensive.

846
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:14,814
Speaker 0: It was really good and really good.

847
00:45:14,935 --> 00:45:26,547
Speaker 0: And what I thought, but it wasn't as expensive as it appeared because remember the, between the built-in tax and the no tipping in restaurants, cause they're getting paid well, but it raises the, obviously that causes the prices of menu items to be raised.

848
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:35,436
Speaker 0: Like it says $70 on a menu for like some of the things, but really that's the equivalent of like a 45 $50 meal in the U S right.

849
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:36,259
Speaker 0: So expensive.

850
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:40,479
Speaker 0: Yes, but not as crazy expensive, like a $70 meal in the U S. I would've been like, hell no.

851
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:43,716
Speaker 1: So we had a pack shirt on and the girl who's seated is like, Oh, you went to packs.

852
00:45:43,897 --> 00:45:44,359
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

853
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:45,663
Speaker 1: I was there to packs is the best.

854
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:51,861
Speaker 1: And that, that played out many times throughout our trip around the city.

855
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:55,376
Speaker 1: People went to packs and new packs and we're totally chill.

856
00:45:55,396 --> 00:45:59,934
Speaker 1: And we kept meeting packs, people all around the city and like gaming shops and on the street.

857
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:04,657
Speaker 1: And even someone we met at the con and hung out with, we tweeted like, Hey, we're going to go eat here.

858
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:05,462
Speaker 1: He just showed up.

859
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,024
Speaker 0: Yeah.

860
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:06,486
Speaker 0: Cool guy.

861
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:07,049
Speaker 0: Hang out with us.

862
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,335
Speaker 0: I think it's Paul, right?

863
00:46:08,395 --> 00:46:08,656
Speaker 0: I think.

864
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:08,938
Speaker 0: Yeah.

865
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:09,360
Speaker 1: Cool guy.

866
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:09,962
Speaker 0: Cool guy.

867
00:46:10,263 --> 00:46:11,207
Speaker 1: And uh, yeah.

868
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:14,340
Speaker 1: The other thing I noticed kind of generally, he's not good at hive though.

869
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,626
Speaker 0: He's got to improve his hive skills.

870
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:24,639
Speaker 1: All the Australians we talked to, even people who didn't have great jobs had a lot more disposable income than the average American.

871
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,748
Speaker 0: Well, things are more expensive, so I hope they did.

872
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:27,210
Speaker 0: Yeah.

873
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:40,432
Speaker 1: But in terms of their purchasing power, like people who, if the equivalent socioeconomic class in the U S at a con would go eat McDonald's because they could literally cannot afford to eat out fancy every night.

874
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:49,282
Speaker 1: Those equivalent people with equivalent jobs in Australia appeared to be able to eat out at nice restaurants in a downtown fancy city.

875
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:53,636
Speaker 0: So, you know, we didn't really go to areas where poor people live.

876
00:46:54,197 --> 00:47:04,292
Speaker 1: Oh, I did run in and I just kind of kept an eye out and the restaurants everywhere were nicer than the equivalent restaurant would be in the U S nice.

877
00:47:04,532 --> 00:47:04,773
Speaker 0: Okay.

878
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,078
Speaker 1: That was my experience.

879
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:11,742
Speaker 1: I have a ton of pictures from a lot of the kind of like normal residential, like the equivalent of far out Queens places.

880
00:47:12,524 --> 00:47:17,317
Speaker 0: Something else that really surprised me in Australia was how big the queen is.

881
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:19,164
Speaker 0: She is kind of a big deal.

882
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:22,842
Speaker 1: We're walking around the botanical garden on Thursday and Scott keeps seeing this building.

883
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:29,252
Speaker 0: Well, we saw, okay, so in the distance we see this castle basically tower with a flag and I'm like, whatever that is, it looks touristy.

884
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:31,161
Speaker 0: It looks the kind of place that Australians won't go.

885
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:32,386
Speaker 0: It also looks like a castle.

886
00:47:32,988 --> 00:47:35,599
Speaker 0: I definitely want to check that the fuck out cause castle.

887
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,025
Speaker 1: So we kind of keep it as a vague.

888
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:42,388
Speaker 0: I know that whatever's there isn't very old cause it's Australia, but I know that it looks like a cast.

889
00:47:42,428 --> 00:47:47,993
Speaker 1: So we basically wander all these gardens with the idea that let's slowly try to edge your way toward this thing.

890
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:50,143
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff between us and that that looks cool.

891
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:58,734
Speaker 0: We saw giant amphitheater that was pretty sweet and awesome pictures of birds and flowers and all kinds of cool stuff in the park.

892
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,383
Speaker 1: People hanging out actually get closer to this thing.

893
00:48:01,764 --> 00:48:06,180
Speaker 0: There's a fence in the way and it's like, huh, why, why is this closed?

894
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,969
Speaker 0: That looks like a thing we should be able to get into.

895
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,659
Speaker 0: The entrance must be on the other side.

896
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:13,493
Speaker 0: So I see an Australian guy walking around in the park.

897
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:17,047
Speaker 0: It was pretty quiet cause it was a Thursday weekday during the day in a giant park.

898
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:20,180
Speaker 0: And I'm like, Hey, uh, do you know if I can get in there?

899
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,803
Speaker 0: How I can get in here?

900
00:48:20,823 --> 00:48:23,298
Speaker 0: He's like, Oh no, the governor, that's the governor's house.

901
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:24,082
Speaker 0: You can't get in there.

902
00:48:24,524 --> 00:48:25,387
Speaker 0: Maybe twice a year.

903
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:27,878
Speaker 0: They open it for like one day for people to go.

904
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:31,051
Speaker 1: I believe at this point you were thinking what elected governor.

905
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:39,208
Speaker 0: I was thinking the governor of Victoria, the person who was elected by the people to be the governor of Victoria, sort of like Gracie mansion, the mayor lives in, in New York.

906
00:48:39,248 --> 00:48:42,200
Speaker 1: Then we realized this is governor in the Sid Myers pirates.

907
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:50,408
Speaker 0: Governor governor, as in like, please, sir, may I have a letter of Mark and go privateering to bring back riches for you governor.

908
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,508
Speaker 0: And I was like, now I really fucking want to go in there and you can't, can't go in there.

909
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,134
Speaker 0: I'm going to go in there.

910
00:48:57,154 --> 00:49:00,446
Speaker 0: I don't care what kind of international incident is going to happen.

911
00:49:01,109 --> 00:49:06,133
Speaker 0: Well, later, later we went into the, I'm going to figure out like the day it's open and that's when I'm going to go to Australia.

912
00:49:06,354 --> 00:49:10,176
Speaker 1: So we went to the tallest building in Melbourne, you know, God, we got to do the touristy stuff and see those things.

913
00:49:10,236 --> 00:49:15,115
Speaker 1: because you like in New York city, you say, Oh, the Eureka tower is touristy.

914
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:16,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's touristy.

915
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:16,541
Speaker 1: You know what?

916
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,067
Speaker 1: It's also a fucking amazing view.

917
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,587
Speaker 1: All the big tall buildings in New York have great views of the city and it is kind of worth it.

918
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:25,100
Speaker 1: So we went and we got a great view of the whole city.

919
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:28,351
Speaker 1: They had this thing called the edge, the edge.

920
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:33,949
Speaker 1: You could pay extra money to stand in a glass cube that moved like 10 feet out and back in.

921
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,798
Speaker 0: It was really, really late.

922
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:38,044
Speaker 0: They didn't let you take cameras in there.

923
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:38,628
Speaker 0: We didn't do it.

924
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:38,970
Speaker 0: Obviously.

925
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,876
Speaker 0: It was really stupid.

926
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:43,413
Speaker 1: Like we're out there, like on this balcony, hanging out with Aaron C and a bunch of enforcers.

927
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:46,851
Speaker 1: And then we look and we see the edge just kind of popped out next to us.

928
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:48,922
Speaker 1: A bunch of kind of bored looking people were standing in there.

929
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:49,524
Speaker 0: Yep.

930
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,049
Speaker 0: They paid 12 bucks for that.

931
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:51,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

932
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:51,672
Speaker 1: Each.

933
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:52,334
Speaker 0: Yeah.

934
00:49:52,675 --> 00:49:52,896
Speaker 0: Wow.

935
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:57,658
Speaker 1: And we could see the governor's house and I think we could have hang glided their base jumped there.

936
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:58,542
Speaker 0: Something like that.

937
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:10,819
Speaker 0: Apparently the previous tallest building in Melbourne, they told us a story that the someone put a restaurant at the top and then some people went to that restaurant, got drinks at the bar and then base jumped off the balcony, which is awesome.

938
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,766
Speaker 1: Oh, here's the story for daredevils.

939
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:15,980
Speaker 1: Do a base jump from Rialto towers after cocktails.

940
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:27,760
Speaker 1: I knew of this story because it's one of those things that was on FARC and you just knew about it a long time ago, but like it was in a collection of like crazy cool things people have done.

941
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:30,469
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize it was in Melbourne.

942
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:31,012
Speaker 1: Yeah.

943
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,302
Speaker 1: And that it was right there that it happened.

944
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:36,840
Speaker 1: And I did not realize the full extent of what these awesome dudes did.

945
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,566
Speaker 0: Awesome people, heroes.

946
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,911
Speaker 1: This is the awesomest thing.

947
00:50:40,012 --> 00:50:42,522
Speaker 1: I encourage more people to do things like this.

948
00:50:42,843 --> 00:50:43,787
Speaker 0: I do as well.

949
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:48,406
Speaker 0: Even if it gets you arrested, which it probably will in the U S it would probably get you really arrested.

950
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:55,346
Speaker 1: If you get arrested after successfully base jumping, that is a badge of honor.

951
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:55,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

952
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:57,153
Speaker 0: That's like an achievement.

953
00:50:57,514 --> 00:50:59,864
Speaker 0: Got arrested, did a base jump that got you arrested.

954
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,070
Speaker 1: I would put that on my resume.

955
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,216
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it was arrested.

956
00:51:02,497 --> 00:51:02,758
Speaker 1: Yeah.

957
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:04,787
Speaker 1: Base jumping off the empire state building.

958
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:06,875
Speaker 0: I would also put that on my resume.

959
00:51:06,895 --> 00:51:08,181
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing.

960
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:11,417
Speaker 1: It's one of those situations where the judge should, yes, it was illegal.

961
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:12,463
Speaker 1: Here's your punishment.

962
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:15,317
Speaker 1: I'm also going to high five you before they put the handcuffs on.

963
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:15,920
Speaker 0: That's right.

964
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:18,504
Speaker 0: Uh, trying to think.

965
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,370
Speaker 1: So, uh, we'll jump around.

966
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:22,799
Speaker 1: We went to an Aussie rules football guy.

967
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:23,622
Speaker 1: I almost want to do it.

968
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:24,547
Speaker 0: That was on Friday.

969
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,260
Speaker 1: I feel like we should do a Tuesday show on Aussie rules football.

970
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:27,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

971
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:35,232
Speaker 0: Let's just say that it was sort of a combination of professional sports and college sports in the way the fans reacted, the way the game is played.

972
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:39,411
Speaker 0: I like certain aspects of the game and I also dislike certain aspects of the game.

973
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:42,684
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it a thousand times more than any soccer game I've ever seen.

974
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,194
Speaker 0: That's your, I would be a fan of this sport.

975
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:52,310
Speaker 0: Were it on, uh, you know, TV in the U S in Jersey, because I love, did you actually buy one?

976
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:56,481
Speaker 1: They're hard as bucks.

977
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:56,964
Speaker 1: So I got it.

978
00:51:57,044 --> 00:51:57,527
Speaker 0: That was a lot.

979
00:51:57,587 --> 00:51:59,416
Speaker 0: I didn't buy one because it's too much money, dude.

980
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:01,104
Speaker 1: I spent like Essendon.

981
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,249
Speaker 0: I was for that.

982
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:03,314
Speaker 0: They got their asses kicked.

983
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:06,568
Speaker 1: It's got, I spent like a hundred and I spent like $200 in my red wings.

984
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:06,889
Speaker 1: Jersey.

985
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:14,159
Speaker 0: So seven bucks for I was, I was for them simply for the fact that a, they seem to be the home team and B their logo is way awesome.

986
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,586
Speaker 0: It's just like a fucking stealth bomber.

987
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:16,249
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh fuck.

988
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,540
Speaker 1: I will say this about AFL and about footy fans.

989
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:19,686
Speaker 1: The game is called footy.

990
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:22,379
Speaker 1: I used to kind of think when people said footy, they meant soccer.

991
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:24,747
Speaker 1: No footy is AFL specifically.

992
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:25,229
Speaker 0: Yeah.

993
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:28,500
Speaker 0: It's way easier to say footy than say to AFL or Aussie football.

994
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:32,256
Speaker 1: We went to pretty much the craziest game that like would happen ever.

995
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:32,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

996
00:52:32,498 --> 00:52:38,041
Speaker 0: Basically there were three, we knew we wanted to go to a game and there were three games happening during the time we were there.

997
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:42,342
Speaker 0: And we asked around and people said, well, look, those two games, one of them's at one stadium.

998
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:44,029
Speaker 0: One's at the other, but those are the shit games.

999
00:52:44,049 --> 00:52:47,284
Speaker 0: That's like Mets versus crappy other crappy team, right?

1000
00:52:47,304 --> 00:52:48,891
Speaker 0: You don't want to see those games like all right.

1001
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:49,835
Speaker 1: Lions Brown.

1002
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:50,438
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1003
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:57,426
Speaker 0: One of the games was at the Melbourne cricket grounds, which is this huge hundred thousand seat stadium, but that was one of the crappy ones.

1004
00:52:57,847 --> 00:52:59,754
Speaker 0: There was also a soccer game.

1005
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:07,276
Speaker 0: Liverpool was in town to play Melbourne in soccer, every hotel in the entire goddamn city.

1006
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:13,360
Speaker 0: So we left town that day because once he found out about that was happening, the concierge was like, yo dog.

1007
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,002
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1008
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:15,430
Speaker 1: There's going to be no hotels in the cities.

1009
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:15,751
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1010
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:16,174
Speaker 0: Get out.

1011
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,346
Speaker 0: So that was also the Melbourne cricket grounds.

1012
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:23,911
Speaker 0: So I kind of wanted to go to the Melbourne cricket grounds because that was the superior arena, the superior field stadium.

1013
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:31,742
Speaker 0: But we ended up going to Eddie hot stadium where the superior game was happening, which is Hawks Essendon, which are the two top teams.

1014
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:39,619
Speaker 0: So that's like fricking seeing, you know, the super bowl, but it wasn't, it was a regular, it was a regular season game between the number one team and the number two team.

1015
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:41,086
Speaker 0: So we went to that one.

1016
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:41,649
Speaker 1: It was great.

1017
00:53:41,729 --> 00:53:45,328
Speaker 1: I want to make the one cultural thing, even though it was a blowout, the cultural observation.

1018
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:45,509
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1019
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:47,158
Speaker 1: We rooted for the wrong goddamn team.

1020
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:49,851
Speaker 1: That's for the cultural observations I want to make about it.

1021
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:55,475
Speaker 1: in this show, as opposed to the separate show we'll do on footy one, you can bet on fucking everything.

1022
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:56,840
Speaker 1: Gambling is just totally legal.

1023
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,829
Speaker 0: Gambling was legal everywhere in Melbourne.

1024
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:00,298
Speaker 1: So Scott and I were at the game.

1025
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,993
Speaker 1: I was like, Hey, I'm going to go see if I can place a bet on the game.

1026
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:03,918
Speaker 1: And I go to the kiosk.

1027
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,749
Speaker 1: You can bet on everything.

1028
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:15,357
Speaker 1: It was like first team to 20 points, first team to 30 points, first team to this spread point spread in either direction, number of behinds.

1029
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,544
Speaker 1: Like you could bet on anything.

1030
00:54:17,624 --> 00:54:18,728
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

1031
00:54:18,748 --> 00:54:20,534
Speaker 0: I would not bet on that.

1032
00:54:20,554 --> 00:54:21,276
Speaker 0: and horse racing.

1033
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:23,564
Speaker 0: I saw horse racing everywhere with betting everywhere.

1034
00:54:23,985 --> 00:54:26,955
Speaker 0: It's like we used to have OTV and it's gone.

1035
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:29,102
Speaker 0: Now they have, what was it called?

1036
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:30,968
Speaker 0: It was like you, Oh, Tats.

1037
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,983
Speaker 0: No, Tats was the lottery, the private lottery, private lottery.

1038
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:40,043
Speaker 0: I think it was UBT or something that was like the, the way to bet on sports from pretty much anywhere.

1039
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:42,697
Speaker 0: And it was like, Whoa, there is betting all over the place.

1040
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:48,081
Speaker 1: They rolled up a truck that just had a horse racing betting outside the stadium for Eddie out of stadium for the footy.

1041
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:48,583
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1042
00:54:48,864 --> 00:55:04,745
Speaker 1: So the other thing I want to point out is that at first, if I had stayed for the first quarter of this game and then left, I would have told you that fans of footy are surprisingly genteel because they are the, a lot of the people were old ladies route that they've been rooting for this team their entire lives.

1043
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:05,387
Speaker 0: Yup.

1044
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:08,758
Speaker 1: And it was a very interesting anti hooliganism culture.

1045
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:19,242
Speaker 1: Like footy fans seem to take pride in the fact that there's very little hooliganism and they really look down on it and they really pride themselves in not being soccer fans with all their bullshit too.

1046
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:24,036
Speaker 1: The, uh, the people were shouting things like, come on bombers.

1047
00:55:24,498 --> 00:55:24,718
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1048
00:55:24,758 --> 00:55:25,842
Speaker 1: Like these very sort of like.

1049
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,066
Speaker 1: the ref is a joke.

1050
00:55:27,126 --> 00:55:28,691
Speaker 1: That was a joke call ref.

1051
00:55:29,354 --> 00:55:32,404
Speaker 1: Like it felt just very quaint and very pleasant to genteel.

1052
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:33,327
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1053
00:55:33,467 --> 00:55:47,346
Speaker 1: After the second half, a man next to us put his hands up to his mouth and yelled immortal words, shit down his throat, shit in his fucking mouth, shit in his fucking mouth and then rip off his head.

1054
00:55:47,366 --> 00:55:53,486
Speaker 1: And it was so beautiful because that was the same man who had been saying the ref is a joke.

1055
00:55:53,908 --> 00:55:55,274
Speaker 1: Not 10 minutes prior.

1056
00:55:55,495 --> 00:55:58,286
Speaker 0: He was one, that was the yelling guy pretty much that was standing behind us.

1057
00:55:58,346 --> 00:56:00,515
Speaker 1: But he was the w. so we showed up, right?

1058
00:56:00,977 --> 00:56:02,163
Speaker 1: And the game like where is?

1059
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:08,970
Speaker 1: hours before the game, we were some of the first people and there's a guy sitting in the seat and he yells footy.

1060
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:18,477
Speaker 1: I was never more proud of a man that I've met who was a stranger than at that moment because all my mind, I was like, did he just say hockey?

1061
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:20,182
Speaker 0: That's what they say.

1062
00:56:20,383 --> 00:56:21,227
Speaker 1: I almost yelled.

1063
00:56:21,267 --> 00:56:22,451
Speaker 1: That's what this is.

1064
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:25,966
Speaker 1: But I didn't want to engage because I was in a foreign land and a foreign sport.

1065
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,034
Speaker 1: I didn't know all the protocols yet.

1066
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:31,206
Speaker 1: I wondered if someone else was going to yell a call back to him.

1067
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,877
Speaker 1: But yeah, we'll talk more about footy in another show.

1068
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:40,220
Speaker 0: So the big thing we did while we were there is we went to the penguin Island, also known as Phillip Island.

1069
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,483
Speaker 1: So Phillip Island to give you a very brief history, penguins everywhere and seals and awesome nature.

1070
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:49,435
Speaker 1: Australians ruined it by moving onto it and building houses.

1071
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:54,254
Speaker 0: They all moved there and built crazy vacation places like holy crap, vacation land.

1072
00:56:54,836 --> 00:56:57,025
Speaker 1: So the Australian government was like, look, you fuckers.

1073
00:56:57,266 --> 00:56:59,254
Speaker 1: So they picked, they took a big chunk of the Island.

1074
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:02,127
Speaker 1: They eminent domain, everybody off of that chunk.

1075
00:57:02,409 --> 00:57:04,640
Speaker 1: And now they're reintroducing the penguin populations.

1076
00:57:06,682 --> 00:57:09,854
Speaker 0: Most of the Island seems to be nature or touristy.

1077
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:11,740
Speaker 0: And there is a town called cows, C?

1078
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,976
Speaker 0: O W E S where people live and there's hotels and restaurants and houses.

1079
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,167
Speaker 0: And it's sort of vacation beach town, right?

1080
00:57:19,347 --> 00:57:23,881
Speaker 0: But a large chunk of the Island is just like, yeah, this is penguin land.

1081
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:28,885
Speaker 0: And then there's other chunks where it's like this, please buy this land and build a housing development and move to it.

1082
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:36,582
Speaker 1: But what's interesting is that a lot like we went to the penguin thing, you know, the, the parade of penguins, you can look up what the parade of penguins is.

1083
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,630
Speaker 1: It is exactly what it sounds like.

1084
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:49,590
Speaker 1: And Scott and I, we figured, you know, everyone on the internet, even people who are cynical jaded travelers, like we are said the penguin thing, it's touristy, but you must see the penguin thing.

1085
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,159
Speaker 1: So we paid for the ultimate penguin experience.

1086
00:57:52,640 --> 00:58:00,651
Speaker 0: So the regular penguin experience, you sit in these bleachers on the beach, the sun goes down, the moon comes up, they turn on lights so you can see.

1087
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:04,965
Speaker 0: And these penguins come out of the water and go to their houses at night.

1088
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:05,988
Speaker 1: It is adorable.

1089
00:58:06,008 --> 00:58:14,500
Speaker 1: The ultimate penguin experience is you go privately with like there was me, Scott and three other people and the ranger and a park ranger, right?

1090
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,543
Speaker 0: Took us into a private, take you to a different beach while the private room first to tell you what's going on.

1091
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:23,160
Speaker 1: And then you give, they give you night vision and shrouds and things to sit on.

1092
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:29,385
Speaker 0: And they take you to a private beach where you watch different penguins come on and go to their homes in the dark.

1093
00:58:29,566 --> 00:58:31,194
Speaker 1: I mean, it's, it's a long experience.

1094
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,591
Speaker 0: Usually like she explained, you sit there for like an hour in the sand and you learn it.

1095
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:35,918
Speaker 1: She really knew her stuff.

1096
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:39,255
Speaker 1: She told us everything about the penguins and what's her job is to know about penguins.

1097
00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:49,878
Speaker 1: And then this tiny group, we walk out into the beach that we'd been hiking on during the day, but now it was closed and we just huddle up on the beach in our black with our night vision and we wait with radios.

1098
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:52,370
Speaker 1: And then the baby penguins, well, they're not baby.

1099
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:53,013
Speaker 1: They're just tiny.

1100
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:55,164
Speaker 0: They're called, they're called the little penguin.

1101
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:55,667
Speaker 0: They're like a foot.

1102
00:58:55,687 --> 00:59:01,780
Speaker 0: They're also known as the fairy penguin, but the official name, I guess, is the little penguin and the little penguins just form rafts in the ocean.

1103
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,953
Speaker 1: Apparently they didn't have babies on the land in penguin town.

1104
00:59:05,013 --> 00:59:07,786
Speaker 0: It wasn't the time yet in this time of year because it was winter.

1105
00:59:08,028 --> 00:59:09,173
Speaker 1: So they don't have to come in.

1106
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:09,515
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1107
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:16,843
Speaker 0: Basically the penguins live in the water and they also have houses on land, but they can stay in the water for fucking ever if they want to.

1108
00:59:16,864 --> 00:59:17,869
Speaker 0: They don't have to come back home.

1109
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:19,438
Speaker 1: They come home to socialize.

1110
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:19,599
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1111
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,410
Speaker 0: Basically, it's like going to work and go into the city.

1112
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:25,920
Speaker 0: It's like they can stay at work for a long time and they can stay at home for a long time and they sleep during, they seem to be nocturnal.

1113
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,462
Speaker 0: Really?

1114
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:29,099
Speaker 1: Now they're pretty safe in penguin town and we keep saying penguin town.

1115
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,407
Speaker 1: No, there was a penguin.

1116
00:59:30,427 --> 00:59:32,499
Speaker 0: That was basically fucking penguin New York right there.

1117
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,150
Speaker 1: The penguins all make their own little houses.

1118
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:40,134
Speaker 0: It's like we're in this place during the day and you don't see or hear any penguins, but they stay signs everywhere.

1119
00:59:40,174 --> 00:59:40,757
Speaker 0: Like watch out.

1120
00:59:40,817 --> 00:59:42,566
Speaker 0: Penguins live here in holes in the ground.

1121
00:59:42,807 --> 00:59:43,892
Speaker 0: Don't step on this shit.

1122
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:47,750
Speaker 0: And then at night they basically all come out and go, they're so loud.

1123
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:49,498
Speaker 1: They're just like walking around talking to each other.

1124
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:53,199
Speaker 1: Like one penguin goes to someone else's house and that guy's like, get the fuck away from my house.

1125
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,379
Speaker 1: The females are like, find a mate and hang out or go to their mate's house or whatever.

1126
00:59:57,459 --> 01:00:05,171
Speaker 1: And they socialize and they're super loud and just walking around all night and interspersed among them are just rabbits everywhere and wallabies everywhere.

1127
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:07,380
Speaker 1: Just hanging out animal gooses.

1128
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,827
Speaker 1: They are so loud.

1129
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,173
Speaker 0: They're loud at night when they work.

1130
01:00:11,213 --> 01:00:14,809
Speaker 1: They're not loud on the beach because the beach is where predators might get them.

1131
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:15,171
Speaker 0: Right.

1132
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,985
Speaker 0: See when they're hanging out in the grass area, they can just go into their house.

1133
01:00:18,226 --> 01:00:22,949
Speaker 1: Imagine if you work in New York city and you commute back to beacon, you know, upstate New York on the train.

1134
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:24,818
Speaker 1: So in New York, New York's awesome.

1135
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:27,870
Speaker 1: You can just stay in New York forever, but occasionally you got to go home.

1136
01:00:28,271 --> 01:00:32,670
Speaker 1: So every day you kind of meet with all the other workers like near a subway train.

1137
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,836
Speaker 1: You're like, should we go home?

1138
01:00:33,957 --> 01:00:34,319
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1139
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:35,423
Speaker 1: Well, that's all.

1140
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:35,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1141
01:00:35,705 --> 01:00:36,046
Speaker 1: Okay.

1142
01:00:36,067 --> 01:00:36,791
Speaker 1: Let's get on the train.

1143
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,244
Speaker 1: So we all get on the train and then the train gets to beacon roll.

1144
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:40,329
Speaker 1: Like you want to get out.

1145
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:42,399
Speaker 1: And then there's wolves at the train station.

1146
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:43,665
Speaker 1: We're not this time.

1147
01:00:44,147 --> 01:00:45,011
Speaker 1: Takes the train back to New York.

1148
01:00:45,031 --> 01:00:46,900
Speaker 0: They basically, they group up so that they're safe.

1149
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,036
Speaker 1: They cross the beach in a group up and decide if they're even going to come in.

1150
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:51,558
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1151
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:53,548
Speaker 0: So they'll see them like the come out of the water.

1152
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:57,005
Speaker 0: The first they'll be in the water and they'll form a group in the water where it's safe.

1153
01:00:57,427 --> 01:01:01,869
Speaker 0: Then they come out onto the beach where they basically have no camo and they have to run across the beach really fast.

1154
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:07,213
Speaker 0: So they'll be in a group on the edge of the water and they'd be like, is there any wolves or foxes on this beach?

1155
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:08,940
Speaker 0: And they'd be like, oh shit danger.

1156
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,004
Speaker 0: And they'll run back in the water and then they'll come back on the beach and be like, I think we can go for it guys.

1157
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:13,527
Speaker 0: Let's go for it.

1158
01:01:13,568 --> 01:01:14,030
Speaker 0: All right, let's go.

1159
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:14,553
Speaker 0: Let's go.

1160
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:16,665
Speaker 0: And they go and they run across the beach really fast.

1161
01:01:16,725 --> 01:01:19,759
Speaker 1: So fast and so quiet, but they're also kind of derpy.

1162
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:20,843
Speaker 1: They keep tripping over stuff.

1163
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:21,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1164
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:22,591
Speaker 0: But they climb big.

1165
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:27,617
Speaker 0: It's like you think these little floppy fins, like they're meant for swimming, not for walking, but they climb right up that hill.

1166
01:01:27,637 --> 01:01:27,958
Speaker 0: Like whoop.

1167
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,999
Speaker 1: What was funny is that there's always a whole bunch of penguins and then that penguin.

1168
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:32,160
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1169
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:32,844
Speaker 0: The brave guy.

1170
01:01:32,864 --> 01:01:35,800
Speaker 1: Well, there's the, there's the brave guy who goes first, all the normal guys.

1171
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:39,280
Speaker 1: And then I can only assume that it's the, that guy of penguins that no one wants to talk to.

1172
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:40,848
Speaker 1: He's always last by himself.

1173
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,938
Speaker 1: And I think everyone just hoping the Fox will get him.

1174
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:43,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

1175
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:47,599
Speaker 0: We saw signs everywhere that like, Hey, we're trying to get the Foxes off the Island.

1176
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:48,664
Speaker 0: If you see one, call us.

1177
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,288
Speaker 0: We never saw one.

1178
01:01:49,328 --> 01:01:56,396
Speaker 1: The ranger said that they have through a combination of poisoning and trapping gotten rid of all but 11 Foxes on this entire Island.

1179
01:01:56,878 --> 01:02:01,596
Speaker 1: And the ranger was like, yeah, those last 11 Foxes are the good God, bad-ass Foxes.

1180
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:10,951
Speaker 1: We can't get them to the smartest of the Fox rabbit in the lion's den because apparently you know, penguin city, there really weren't predators like Fox in the human's den.

1181
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,237
Speaker 0: That's a bad-ass Fox.

1182
01:02:12,257 --> 01:02:16,051
Speaker 1: So if a Fox goes to penguin town, he'll kill like 400 penguins.

1183
01:02:16,473 --> 01:02:16,974
Speaker 0: Of course.

1184
01:02:16,995 --> 01:02:19,424
Speaker 1: So yeah, they're trying to get rid of all the Foxes.

1185
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,493
Speaker 1: Apparently what's sad is I'll be.

1186
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:30,924
Speaker 1: another big problem for the penguins is feral cats and humans who have cats that they let wander around, but due to public sentiment, they don't poison the cats.

1187
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:35,464
Speaker 1: They trap them and release them on other places and they still let people own cat.

1188
01:02:35,504 --> 01:02:37,595
Speaker 1: So the cats are pretty much always going to be a problem.

1189
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:40,370
Speaker 1: I say if you're going to poison the Foxes, you poison the cats too.

1190
01:02:40,652 --> 01:02:40,812
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1191
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:41,134
Speaker 0: Why not?

1192
01:02:41,516 --> 01:02:42,180
Speaker 1: Because they're, they're.

1193
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,317
Speaker 1: similarly, uh, there's similar threat levels to those amazingly adorable.

1194
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:47,402
Speaker 0: We don't have a cat shortage.

1195
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:48,426
Speaker 0: We have a penguin shortage.

1196
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:48,767
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1197
01:02:49,108 --> 01:02:49,309
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1198
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:54,291
Speaker 1: But yeah, having the night vision was kind of cool because the penguins couldn't see at first.

1199
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:55,839
Speaker 0: I'm like, Oh, they gave us the night vision.

1200
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,005
Speaker 0: I just want to see the penguins.

1201
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:57,768
Speaker 0: I'm not going to use it.

1202
01:02:57,909 --> 01:02:59,055
Speaker 0: I can see them without it.

1203
01:02:59,376 --> 01:02:59,879
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

1204
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,004
Speaker 1: It is so dark.

1205
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,953
Speaker 1: It is dark until you see all this other stuff.

1206
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:05,566
Speaker 0: And it was nice to have some darkness after living in New York city.

1207
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:11,891
Speaker 0: That was the first time in a while I've seen like fucking stars and shit, but the wallabies could see the IR splash.

1208
01:03:12,212 --> 01:03:17,131
Speaker 1: So I'd be like scanning and I'd see a wallaby and the wallaby would see me looking at him like, what the fuck dude?

1209
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:18,617
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

1210
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:21,128
Speaker 1: Cause he could see it like a flashlight aimed at him.

1211
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:22,877
Speaker 1: But the penguins couldn't see that.

1212
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:23,961
Speaker 1: The rabbits couldn't see that.

1213
01:03:23,982 --> 01:03:24,483
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1214
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:25,688
Speaker 0: All right.

1215
01:03:25,788 --> 01:03:27,032
Speaker 0: Other things on that Island.

1216
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,622
Speaker 0: Uh, another surreal experience at a restaurant.

1217
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:30,566
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

1218
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:38,682
Speaker 1: So we went to this great restaurant that has this great dog and got some great food, but it was like this beer place, but we run by a guy who was clearly a beer nerd of Australia.

1219
01:03:38,702 --> 01:03:39,848
Speaker 1: That guy is such a beer nerd.

1220
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:42,764
Speaker 1: It was one of the only places in Australia that you had his horsey beer, right?

1221
01:03:42,925 --> 01:03:43,005
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1222
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:43,587
Speaker 1: I did have a source.

1223
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:45,154
Speaker 0: It was really good.

1224
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:47,764
Speaker 1: Most of the beer I had in Australia was mediocre.

1225
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:48,005
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1226
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:49,190
Speaker 1: No fosters in Australia.

1227
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:50,636
Speaker 1: You narrow shit.

1228
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:54,307
Speaker 1: Beer is Carlton, Carlton dress mediocre.

1229
01:03:54,407 --> 01:03:55,531
Speaker 0: It's basically, isn't it?

1230
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,220
Speaker 0: sort of like, uh, no, what's it called?

1231
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,724
Speaker 0: What's that shit that people drink in New York?

1232
01:04:01,227 --> 01:04:01,709
Speaker 0: No, no.

1233
01:04:02,992 --> 01:04:05,498
Speaker 1: Uh, Emily's yelling suggestions.

1234
01:04:05,518 --> 01:04:06,421
Speaker 0: It's not that one.

1235
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,307
Speaker 0: It's a mediocre beer.

1236
01:04:08,688 --> 01:04:11,396
Speaker 1: It's a step below Stella in terms of goodness.

1237
01:04:12,038 --> 01:04:12,599
Speaker 0: Just man.

1238
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:12,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1239
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,282
Speaker 0: That's right.

1240
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:13,564
Speaker 0: Stella.

1241
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:14,027
Speaker 0: That's the one.

1242
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:16,341
Speaker 1: It's not the same kind of beer really, but it's mediocre beer.

1243
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:16,924
Speaker 0: But it's the same.

1244
01:04:16,964 --> 01:04:21,846
Speaker 1: It feels the same as niche and there's this local blonde that's like the other local beer also kind of meh.

1245
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:27,788
Speaker 1: But uh, we went to this Mexican restaurant, a family Mexican cantina because it was late at night.

1246
01:04:27,808 --> 01:04:29,234
Speaker 0: There was only two other people there.

1247
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:32,467
Speaker 1: Not a lot of Mexican food in Australia.

1248
01:04:32,528 --> 01:04:32,748
Speaker 0: Nope.

1249
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:34,114
Speaker 0: So we're like, well, let's check this out.

1250
01:04:34,355 --> 01:04:35,420
Speaker 1: So we go to this place.

1251
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:38,171
Speaker 1: It's like 45 minutes before the place is supposed to close.

1252
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:39,897
Speaker 1: There's one girl up front.

1253
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:42,368
Speaker 1: There's some people finishing a meal and about to leave.

1254
01:04:42,448 --> 01:04:44,035
Speaker 1: So we're like, yeah, table for two.

1255
01:04:44,055 --> 01:04:49,648
Speaker 1: And it was just quiet and empty and surreal and weird.

1256
01:04:50,049 --> 01:04:50,710
Speaker 0: So we are.

1257
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,674
Speaker 0: So we order and super hungry.

1258
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:53,255
Speaker 0: Every plate.

1259
01:04:53,275 --> 01:04:59,150
Speaker 0: We're so far has had normal size portions, not American portions.

1260
01:04:59,390 --> 01:04:59,611
Speaker 0: Right.

1261
01:05:00,052 --> 01:05:03,824
Speaker 0: So we ordered a big nacho and just an entree each.

1262
01:05:04,045 --> 01:05:04,245
Speaker 1: Yup.

1263
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:12,736
Speaker 1: So we wait in like 40 minutes go by and now it's like five minutes before the place closes and we get our nachos at some point and they're gigantic.

1264
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:14,384
Speaker 1: They're, they're more food that we can eat.

1265
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:20,529
Speaker 1: So we're picking at him like assuming we're going to eat a bunch and take a bunch home and our main dishes never come.

1266
01:05:21,693 --> 01:05:23,418
Speaker 0: It's meanwhile, eventually we sit there.

1267
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,265
Speaker 0: It's quiet and eerie and surreal.

1268
01:05:25,285 --> 01:05:27,655
Speaker 0: I think they refilled our water once or twice.

1269
01:05:27,716 --> 01:05:36,488
Speaker 1: And the lady comes over a few times and never bring, I think she was waiting for us to finish those fucking nachos before she was going to even start cooking our main dishes.

1270
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:37,150
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1271
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:37,793
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1272
01:05:37,853 --> 01:05:43,691
Speaker 0: But then eventually after a super long time, it's way past closing time, they bring our actual meals.

1273
01:05:43,952 --> 01:05:46,158
Speaker 0: Now gigantic.

1274
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:48,305
Speaker 1: I'm full.

1275
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:49,609
Speaker 0: We can barely eat it.

1276
01:05:49,749 --> 01:05:53,320
Speaker 0: I had, I got, it was like, mine was like a taco and an enchilada.

1277
01:05:54,402 --> 01:05:58,522
Speaker 1: Like something I normally would have been able to eat, but I kept picking those nachos of other mush.

1278
01:05:59,204 --> 01:06:00,770
Speaker 1: So we eat and even wasn't that good.

1279
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,058
Speaker 1: So finally I go up to the front.

1280
01:06:03,098 --> 01:06:04,284
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, can we get the check?

1281
01:06:04,324 --> 01:06:04,927
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

1282
01:06:05,148 --> 01:06:05,289
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1283
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:09,129
Speaker 0: And I was like, you know, I just wanted to take mine back cause I so much foods.

1284
01:06:09,149 --> 01:06:10,254
Speaker 0: It's like a whole taco.

1285
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:11,139
Speaker 1: Can we get a takeaway?

1286
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,646
Speaker 1: And she's like, we don't allow takeaway.

1287
01:06:12,827 --> 01:06:13,771
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what do you mean?

1288
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,444
Speaker 0: So we're like, what are you going to do with that taco?

1289
01:06:16,665 --> 01:06:19,980
Speaker 0: We look at this and I'm just like, I'm just like, fine, take, take my money.

1290
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:21,506
Speaker 0: Getting out of this weird situation.

1291
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:25,582
Speaker 1: So now we leave like almost two hours after we walked into this place.

1292
01:06:25,883 --> 01:06:27,006
Speaker 1: It's so late at night.

1293
01:06:27,287 --> 01:06:28,370
Speaker 1: I'm so tired.

1294
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,734
Speaker 1: I'm so full.

1295
01:06:29,995 --> 01:06:34,710
Speaker 1: We left multiple pounds of food behind us and the lady paid for a story.

1296
01:06:35,272 --> 01:06:41,231
Speaker 1: And the lady, the reason it was so surreal is that it was quiet, like deathly quiet the whole time.

1297
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:51,221
Speaker 1: The lady never said a non-functional word to us the entire time and never changed the completely blank expression on her face at any point.

1298
01:06:51,903 --> 01:06:55,837
Speaker 1: And when we were like, we left and she just kind of stood there.

1299
01:06:56,057 --> 01:07:03,331
Speaker 1: Like as we walked out, I looked back and she was just standing there behind the bar, like not doing anything, just kind of looking really weird.

1300
01:07:03,411 --> 01:07:04,034
Speaker 0: It was weird.

1301
01:07:04,094 --> 01:07:05,780
Speaker 1: We went back to our seahorsee hotel.

1302
01:07:06,321 --> 01:07:07,064
Speaker 1: That was pretty great.

1303
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,816
Speaker 0: It was, it was a typical drive in motel.

1304
01:07:09,837 --> 01:07:12,985
Speaker 0: It was a beach, vacation kind of place.

1305
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:13,868
Speaker 1: So that was kind of fun.

1306
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:14,129
Speaker 1: Yep.

1307
01:07:14,712 --> 01:07:21,745
Speaker 1: And at this beach motel in the winter, we were like some of the only people there were maybe a handful of people staying at this place and it was a great place.

1308
01:07:22,066 --> 01:07:27,182
Speaker 1: But the guy who checked us in was super nice, super friendly tourist, welcoming guy.

1309
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:29,572
Speaker 1: He knew everything about this island.

1310
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:30,355
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1311
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:30,837
Speaker 0: He lives there.

1312
01:07:31,038 --> 01:07:32,888
Speaker 1: And then he starts giving us advice like, well, you should do this.

1313
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:33,432
Speaker 1: You should do this.

1314
01:07:33,734 --> 01:07:35,464
Speaker 1: Oh, you might be able to take a boat to go with these.

1315
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:35,926
Speaker 1: The seals.

1316
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:38,879
Speaker 0: He's like, he's like, he tells us about the seals.

1317
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:40,688
Speaker 0: And I'm like, is there a boat that goes to the seals?

1318
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:41,653
Speaker 0: He says, let me check.

1319
01:07:42,276 --> 01:07:45,950
Speaker 0: And he gets a computer printout of the boat status of that day.

1320
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:54,946
Speaker 1: Not just the boat status, but the status of the seas, all the ferries, all the, everything that happens on the island, whether or not it's like how high tech is this little island.

1321
01:07:55,006 --> 01:07:58,259
Speaker 0: And this little motel is hooked up to the high tech island system.

1322
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,789
Speaker 0: No place in the U S is like that.

1323
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,909
Speaker 1: We want to see the koala preserve because koalas kind of got out.

1324
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,997
Speaker 1: They kind of got out competed by the world.

1325
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,054
Speaker 1: They're not the most efficient animal, so they need a lot of help to not be extinct.

1326
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:16,310
Speaker 0: So we went to the preserve to see them and they're sleeping as they said they would be.

1327
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:16,633
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1328
01:08:16,653 --> 01:08:19,805
Speaker 1: They're basically just balls of fur that hang out in trees, not moving.

1329
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:21,571
Speaker 0: They move, not a lot.

1330
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:26,731
Speaker 1: And one of them long enough to scratch his stomach for a little bit and then go back to sleep.

1331
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:27,374
Speaker 1: It was kind of cute.

1332
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:28,439
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

1333
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:29,783
Speaker 1: Have you ever koala?

1334
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:30,225
Speaker 0: Yep.

1335
01:08:30,688 --> 01:08:33,642
Speaker 0: I mostly, I was actually more impressed with all the birdies than the koalas.

1336
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:35,652
Speaker 1: Oh, the bird photography and the birds.

1337
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:36,053
Speaker 1: We're all took.

1338
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:38,023
Speaker 1: My favorite bird is that little blue rain.

1339
01:08:38,264 --> 01:08:39,830
Speaker 0: You like the blue guy, little blue guy.

1340
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:43,749
Speaker 0: I actually like the guy that we just saw even outside preserve areas.

1341
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:44,513
Speaker 0: It's like in the city.

1342
01:08:44,593 --> 01:08:45,800
Speaker 0: He was sort of white and black.

1343
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:49,362
Speaker 0: And it's like, Oh, that looks sort of like an interesting tropical bird, but he's just sort of everywhere.

1344
01:08:49,582 --> 01:08:49,764
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1345
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:53,639
Speaker 1: There were a bunch of parrots on the, uh, the, uh, old racetrack that I went to.

1346
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:56,828
Speaker 1: We might have to do multiple shows.

1347
01:08:56,849 --> 01:08:57,734
Speaker 1: We got on for a while.

1348
01:08:57,754 --> 01:08:59,624
Speaker 1: I got a lot of cool stuff to say still about Australia.

1349
01:08:59,865 --> 01:09:00,126
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1350
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:02,015
Speaker 0: Australia is a lot going on there.

1351
01:09:02,035 --> 01:09:02,256
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1352
01:09:02,276 --> 01:09:04,666
Speaker 1: We didn't even talk about how Scott broke his arm.

1353
01:09:05,127 --> 01:09:06,153
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess we didn't.

1354
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:06,635
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1355
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,398
Speaker 1: We'll save that for it.

1356
01:09:07,438 --> 01:09:08,684
Speaker 1: We'll do another Australia show.

1357
01:09:08,825 --> 01:09:09,026
Speaker 1: Good.

1358
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,272
Speaker 0: We'll get through another Thursday.

1359
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:12,202
Speaker 0: This is what happens when you save your laser.

1360
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:14,612
Speaker 0: So much more to laser, not fully uncharged.

1361
01:09:14,652 --> 01:09:18,203
Speaker 1: We've barely even scratched the surface of the cool shit that happened to us in Australia.

1362
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:19,064
Speaker 0: All right, good.

1363
01:09:25,216 --> 01:09:27,764
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1364
01:09:27,804 --> 01:09:32,644
