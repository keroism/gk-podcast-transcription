1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,448
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, January 24th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:10,729
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:14,000
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,440
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight to strategy guides for your games.

5
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:23,848
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,659
Speaker 0: It's me and Mario.

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,350
Speaker 0: I feel like I should have gone to a convention.

8
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:34,530
Speaker 1: It's the opposite of convention season until March, April.

9
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:35,470
Speaker 0: Until PAX.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,434
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

12
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:38,790
Speaker 0: We're just waiting on PAX at this point.

13
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,250
Speaker 0: And Anime Boston, which is actually the same time.

14
00:00:42,894 --> 00:00:43,369
Speaker 1: Good job.

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,120
Speaker 0: Well, what do you mean good job?

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,150
Speaker 0: There's really no way around that.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,710
Speaker 0: It's the only holiday weekend in that general vicinity.

18
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,658
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

19
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:50,770
Speaker 1: Good job, guys.

20
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:53,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I foresee neither of them moving.

21
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,270
Speaker 1: No, we already know neither one's moving.

22
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,875
Speaker 1: Yeah.

23
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:57,119
Speaker 0: No, no.

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,710
Speaker 0: I mean, this year.

25
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,789
Speaker 0: But I'm saying in the future years, Anime Boston traditionally is always on.

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,489
Speaker 0: Of course, I think Anime Boston published like the next 10 years or so of ABs.

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,328
Speaker 0: Maybe just look at that.

28
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,019
Speaker 1: Yup.

29
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:12,638
Speaker 1: Anyway, are you looking?

30
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:13,260
Speaker 1: are you looking at it?

31
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,795
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you were looking to say something.

32
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,699
Speaker 0: So in other news, guess what?

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,699
Speaker 0: Guess what?

34
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,399
Speaker 1: New York Giants.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,248
Speaker 0: Yeah.

36
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:24,717
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

37
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,180
Speaker 1: And you know, I just want you know, OK, they don't have to win.

38
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,068
Speaker 1: It'll be all right.

39
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:30,917
Speaker 1: You know, we won in '07.

40
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,300
Speaker 1: I can live off that for a long time.

41
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,540
Speaker 0: Well, I want to say that I think they have a chance of winning.

42
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,355
Speaker 1: They actually that's that's scaring me because in '07 I go in.

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,253
Speaker 1: I'm like, they can't win this game.

44
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:41,718
Speaker 1: It's impossible.

45
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,207
Speaker 1: And then they won.

46
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:44,520
Speaker 1: It was like, holy shit.

47
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,326
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me?

48
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,860
Speaker 0: We actually might win this year.

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,700
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, actually, they look like the best team because they suddenly got really good when everyone was no longer injured.

50
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 0: My company is working on contingency plans in case we can't get into the office due to parades and shenanigans.

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,222
Speaker 1: Yeah.

52
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,000
Speaker 1: Here's the contingency plan.

53
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,108
Speaker 1: Go to parade.

54
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:02,580
Speaker 1: Enjoy parade.

55
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,179
Speaker 1: Wait for parade to finish.

56
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,060
Speaker 1: Eat lunch, then go to work.

57
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,360
Speaker 0: Oh, I will go to the parade.

58
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,020
Speaker 0: But my ops guys have to at least, you know, monitor the production system from their phones while watching the parade.

59
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:24,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, I do want to point out, though, you know, I'm going on the Twitters and, you know, a lot of the people I follow on Twitter are, you know, Silicon Valley nerds.

60
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:26,080
Speaker 1: They were all like forty niners.

61
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,464
Speaker 1: Whoo.

62
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:27,460
Speaker 1: That's that's understandable.

63
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:34,740
Speaker 1: But there is an equally large number of people I'm following and also just people in general, nerdy people are like sports.

64
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,466
Speaker 0: We've talked about that.

65
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:39,060
Speaker 0: How we have talked about it is no different from gamer.

66
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,640
Speaker 1: We have talked about it before, but I thought that it just bears repeating, considering we're two weeks away from the Super Bowl.

67
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:48,500
Speaker 0: The Bears, the Bears, the Bears, the Bears, didn't make the playoffs.

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,020
Speaker 1: The Bears, the Bears repeating share that you should not be disrespecting the sports.

69
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,263
Speaker 1: Sports is good.

70
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:58,899
Speaker 1: Well, I know why first nerdery this combat needs to end.

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:08,500
Speaker 0: Well, we know why it happens, because look at most schools like middle school, high school, the nerdier, smarter kids tend to take band as opposed to gym.

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,580
Speaker 0: And in many school districts, they're mutually exclusive, which is one of the first.

73
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:18,724
Speaker 1: big people who tend to be better at the brain activities tend to not be as good as the arm and leg.

74
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:21,100
Speaker 0: I would actually disagree on that front.

75
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:29,780
Speaker 0: No, you know, you look at most of the people I know, Scott, who are nerds or geeks, who are like really anti sport and are really physically unfit.

76
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:31,559
Speaker 0: Not that bright either.

77
00:03:31,782 --> 00:03:33,079
Speaker 0: Nerdy interest does not mean smart.

78
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,880
Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying you go to the high schools, right?

79
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,241
Speaker 1: Show me the high school where the nerdiest kid is also the quarterback of the football team.

80
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:54,578
Speaker 0: So, Scott, the quarterback of my the quarterback of my high school's football team was also the homecoming king, and he skipped football games to go to the band stuff because he was also in the marching band.

81
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,985
Speaker 0: Yeah.

82
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,340
Speaker 1: No, anyone in my school.

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 1: I mean, there were smart people who also played sports.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,979
Speaker 0: We've talked about that, too.

85
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,240
Speaker 0: I went to kind of school where the smartest people like the band was the popular kids and generally like the football players were kind of like, hey, who are they?

86
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,413
Speaker 0: Like it was a weird.

87
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:09,959
Speaker 1: show me that.

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,599
Speaker 1: Show me the kid who's like the nerd sitting in the back of the class playing pokemons and then is also pick first in gym class.

89
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,459
Speaker 1: Well, here's sure that guy exists.

90
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,060
Speaker 0: Here's my argument as to why that is the case.

91
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,759
Speaker 0: Gym class in the majority of schools in America barely involves physical activity and is basically just bullshit.

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Speaker 1: My gym class always involved physical activity.

93
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:30,627
Speaker 0: Yeah.

94
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:31,680
Speaker 0: What kind of physical activity?

95
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,348
Speaker 1: All kinds.

96
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:32,940
Speaker 0: Like what?

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,019
Speaker 0: Most gym classes that I've seen playing sports.

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

99
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:39,320
Speaker 0: Most gym classes that I've seen that people talk about, especially if it's not a specific gym class.

100
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,820
Speaker 0: Like I took tennis and that was tennis.

101
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,563
Speaker 0: That was pretty good.

102
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:52,640
Speaker 0: But like general phys ed in middle school and elementary school is structure comes out, throws some balls out, says play dodgeball and then goes to his office to jerk off or sleep or whatever dodgeball.

103
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
Speaker 1: We played and is a physical activity.

104
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:54,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

105
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,540
Speaker 0: With poorly defined rules.

106
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,520
Speaker 1: Usually we had excellently defined rules and no cheating.

107
00:04:59,661 --> 00:04:59,861
Speaker 0: I know.

108
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,548
Speaker 0: I'm saying that's usually not.

109
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,804
Speaker 1: the gym person did not go back and jerk off in their office.

110
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,115
Speaker 1: They were refereeing.

111
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:06,760
Speaker 1: quite excellent.

112
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,300
Speaker 0: Scott, what I'm saying is that is atypical of the average gym experience anyway, partly because gym teachers aren't paid that well.

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,620
Speaker 1: And you got off topic.

114
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,402
Speaker 1: The point is.

115
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,900
Speaker 1: All you guys in Green Bay, you said, well, it's simple.

116
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:24,760
Speaker 0: New Orleans, you suck one's understanding of Thaco or for example, you suck the most.

117
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:38,772
Speaker 0: For example, whether or not it is Tanari or the other kind of demon that is, you know, the opposite of immune to cold, rots, steel or iron or whatever be as cold iron gets the demons, not the devils.

118
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:39,240
Speaker 1: Sure.

119
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:39,950
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

120
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,479
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

121
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,460
Speaker 1: I'm not 100 percent sure, but I'm pretty sure that it works against demons, but not devils.

122
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,500
Speaker 0: I was trying to make a flaw anyway.

123
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,758
Speaker 0: So that level of knowledge is literally no different than the guy who knows the batting averages of the nineteen seventy eight.

124
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:57,059
Speaker 0: I was going to say jets just to see if anyone even noticed among our listenership.

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,060
Speaker 1: Stop disrespecting sports instead.

126
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,620
Speaker 0: Maybe you should go now you're allowed to disrespect baseball because it's boring as fuck.

127
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,600
Speaker 1: You should go research some and learn about it, maybe.

128
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,302
Speaker 1: And then maybe, you know, you won't because basically you're calling the kettle black, right?

129
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,760
Speaker 1: Some sports guys like nerdy bullshit, blah, blah, blah.

130
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,199
Speaker 1: It's like, well, you're being the same thing.

131
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,539
Speaker 1: You both, you know, stop hating the other guy's geekery.

132
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,194
Speaker 1: Now, instead, learn about more geekery.

133
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,260
Speaker 1: is that is what we preach.

134
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:29,075
Speaker 0: I'm a hater on soccer nights, but I hate on soccer in the same way that I hate on particular video games.

135
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:29,360
Speaker 0: Right.

136
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:37,660
Speaker 1: It's only you know, I'm not going to just you know, it's like it's one of those things where it's like people get down on a category they like anime sucks or manga sucks.

137
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,580
Speaker 1: Whereas like if I'm hating on soccer, that's a specific sport.

138
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,222
Speaker 1: I am not down on sport, but it seems like a lot of nerds will be down on sport in general.

139
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:52,920
Speaker 1: But if you were to say be down on fantasy, they would go nuts and be like, you can't just draw an entire category.

140
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,260
Speaker 1: It's like, well, you're throwing out sport.

141
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:05,920
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, learn about some, you know, not not to cast any dispersions, but there's the stereotype of the fat, sad nerd who can't get any action on the opposite sex or the same sex, depending on their preference.

142
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:12,258
Speaker 0: Maybe if you move around a little bit, maybe you should enjoy more.

143
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,284
Speaker 1: geekery is not less.

144
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,540
Speaker 1: sport is a geekery.

145
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,565
Speaker 0: The idea.

146
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:15,907
Speaker 0: also.

147
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,640
Speaker 0: think of this idea of the classical education.

148
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:22,180
Speaker 0: You know, you have to be of sound mind and sound body.

149
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:22,962
Speaker 1: Yeah.

150
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,460
Speaker 1: Anyway, and sound body doesn't mean it makes a sound when you walk.

151
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,619
Speaker 0: So I got the do sex.

152
00:07:32,842 --> 00:07:33,834
Speaker 0: I'm playing the do sex.

153
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,259
Speaker 0: You know what?

154
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:35,675
Speaker 1: You like to do sex.

155
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,699
Speaker 1: The do sex also is pretty fucking good.

156
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,119
Speaker 1: I could do sex every day.

157
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,807
Speaker 0: In fact, most people wish that.

158
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,560
Speaker 0: I decided that my favorite thing in the world.

159
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:52,179
Speaker 0: In the do sex is to tap a guy on the shoulder and then cold cock him in the jaw with my metal motherfucking arm.

160
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,539
Speaker 1: So you're a rapist?

161
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:56,780
Speaker 0: There's X human revolution.

162
00:07:57,421 --> 00:07:58,480
Speaker 0: Scott's going to be down on it.

163
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,205
Speaker 0: He hasn't played it.

164
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,080
Speaker 0: He's he's going to talk about how it sucks.

165
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,964
Speaker 0: He's so uninterested.

166
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:05,748
Speaker 1: I've never played it, so I don't know if it sucks, but I really did not like the first one.

167
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:06,696
Speaker 1: It is it is super fun.

168
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,600
Speaker 0: And I did not like the first day sex that much either.

169
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,247
Speaker 0: But I am really enjoying the new day of sex, probably because I only paid fifteen dollars for it.

170
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:15,959
Speaker 1: That's a good price.

171
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

172
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,299
Speaker 1: Maybe here's why.

173
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,119
Speaker 0: Here's why this game is fun.

174
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,418
Speaker 0: This is not I don't know.

175
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,620
Speaker 0: Dude, Scott, it's fifteen dollars.

176
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,446
Speaker 1: That's a lot of money.

177
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,440
Speaker 0: I spend more than that on lunch every day.

178
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,609
Speaker 1: I spent a lot less than that.

179
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,880
Speaker 1: And I actually had two lunches today.

180
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,779
Speaker 1: I got a pizza and a pasta.

181
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,539
Speaker 1: Ah, and that was still less than fifteen dollars.

182
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,203
Speaker 0: You know where I went?

183
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:37,119
Speaker 0: There's a Japanese bakery right by me.

184
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:41,558
Speaker 0: OK, so I got a hot dog with like a hot dog and a bun.

185
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:43,919
Speaker 0: No, it was a hot dog and a croissant.

186
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:48,520
Speaker 0: OK, with like ketchup and some other weird stuff on it.

187
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,420
Speaker 1: Was it one of those ones where the hot dog is cold?

188
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:51,005
Speaker 0: Yes.

189
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:52,040
Speaker 1: I don't like that.

190
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,823
Speaker 0: I like stuff like that.

191
00:08:53,264 --> 00:09:02,320
Speaker 0: And I got a a custard coronet, which is basically a coronet of pastry filled with custard, like Pinkie Pie levels of custard.

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,600
Speaker 1: It was I researched how to make, you know, pastry cream.

193
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:12,380
Speaker 1: Oh, and then I was like, well, I can you know, it's actually kind of hard to make just, you know, in your house.

194
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,062
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

195
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:17,003
Speaker 1: It requires many steps, but I'm like, well, it requires many steps, but I could do it.

196
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:20,263
Speaker 1: The thing is, and it's like, well, what the fuck can you do with pastry cream?

197
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:21,479
Speaker 1: besides just eat it straight up?

198
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,679
Speaker 1: Just eat it straight up.

199
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Speaker 1: The only the only thing that I could find to do with it is basically put it into buns and make puffs like basically homemade beard papa.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,799
Speaker 1: But the thing is, you need to buy the puffs somewhere.

201
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 0: So I'm sad to say that fresh direct.

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,740
Speaker 0: I was like, I wonder if I can just buy pastry cream.

203
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,264
Speaker 0: No, I can't.

204
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:41,800
Speaker 0: No, I get whipped cream.

205
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,867
Speaker 0: But then you get beard.

206
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:43,855
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

207
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:45,631
Speaker 0: I want a beard papa.

208
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:46,620
Speaker 0: You know what I hate in Japan?

209
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:48,099
Speaker 0: I went to beard fucking papas.

210
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:48,708
Speaker 0: That's right.

211
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,540
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

212
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,599
Speaker 0: I forgot how much I love them.

213
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,124
Speaker 1: That's good.

214
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:52,398
Speaker 1: So I'm just saying we can make those.

215
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:05,439
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's funny we got on a tangent about food because the reason I bought Deus Ex and played it now instead of waiting for it to be a dollar was that Dave Riley and Joel White went nuts about this game.

216
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:17,759
Speaker 0: And pretty much everything I have to say about the game can be summed up by listening to Dave Riley say what he thought about the game, because I enjoy it for the same reasons with one additional thing.

217
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:19,780
Speaker 0: You know why I'm enjoying this game so much?

218
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:20,860
Speaker 0: You know, you know, it's Deus Ex.

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,179
Speaker 0: So you like level up your stuff like I'm going to walk around and shoot things.

220
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,520
Speaker 0: Actually, no, I don't really shoot things so much.

221
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,194
Speaker 0: I mostly do the stealth and the stealth actually work.

222
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,044
Speaker 1: because in the first one, the stealth doesn't work.

223
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,008
Speaker 0: The stealth works.

224
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 1: only the only game I've ever played in my life.

225
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,419
Speaker 1: You know, there are a lot of games out there that say they're stealth games.

226
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:43,572
Speaker 1: The only game I've ever played in my life for the stealth actually works and is actually stealth is thief and the other thief games.

227
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,300
Speaker 0: in this game, the stealth actually works.

228
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:48,172
Speaker 0: In fact, the stealth is modified by a lot of stuff.

229
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:54,642
Speaker 0: like in one mission, you have to bust into the police station and like steal something out of the skull of a guy you shot earlier.

230
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:58,340
Speaker 0: OK, he's in the morgue and it's all on lockdown.

231
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:01,600
Speaker 0: So let me count the ways you can approach this one.

232
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:10,899
Speaker 0: You can just fucking break in through the roof and like sneak around the police station, don't get caught, maybe tase a couple of guys, cold cock him in the face, bust in, steal the thing, get out and the stealth works great.

233
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,734
Speaker 0: Or you can convince the guy on the front desk to let you in, in which case the people walking around don't immediately go, hey, what the fuck.

234
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:25,400
Speaker 0: and like attack you because you're kind of supposed to be there, like someone let you in, but they're wary of you.

235
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,226
Speaker 0: They kind of watch you.

236
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,723
Speaker 0: So they're just kind of like walking around, like kind of looking at you.

237
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:35,320
Speaker 0: And if you do anything weird, they walk over like, hey, what are you doing trying to climb into that grate there?

238
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:36,386
Speaker 0: What's up?

239
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:37,899
Speaker 0: Maybe you should leave.

240
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:41,808
Speaker 0: And if you just try to like hack a computer and they see you, they're like, oh, what the fuck is this?

241
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:42,276
Speaker 0: They shoot you.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,840
Speaker 0: OK, so it actually works pretty intelligently.

243
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:49,740
Speaker 0: The line of sight, like the hiding and everything is pretty spot on.

244
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,060
Speaker 0: Like, guys, if they could have seen you, they can see you.

245
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,559
Speaker 0: Like if you're like you pick up and a guy's looking right at you, he just sees you.

246
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:58,337
Speaker 0: But if he wasn't looking right at you, he doesn't see if you just pick up.

247
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:08,360
Speaker 0: But the reason and the way I'm enjoying this game is that I decided that what I want to do is play the major Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell.

248
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,279
Speaker 0: So I'm only leveling up things and doing things that she would do.

249
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:21,284
Speaker 0: And as a result, I basically turned the character into the major and I'm jumping off of buildings, landing behind a guy, cold cocking him, turning invisible and then shooting people.

250
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:22,760
Speaker 1: OK, it's great.

251
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,221
Speaker 0: Sure.

252
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:24,240
Speaker 0: The game is awesome.

253
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,010
Speaker 0: Don't listen to Scott.

254
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:25,659
Speaker 0: You should all play it.

255
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,183
Speaker 0: I don't know.

256
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:27,658
Speaker 1: I just haven't played this game, so I don't know.

257
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:41,138
Speaker 1: But I'm just extremely skeptical of a game that is a sequel to a game that was extremely overhyped and reviewed like, oh, my God, a billion hundred stars, greatest ever and is kind of sucky.

258
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,241
Speaker 1: So if there's a sequel to that game, I'm going to be extremely skeptical that it is any good.

259
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:47,239
Speaker 0: Also, the game is basically Robocop.

260
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,043
Speaker 0: That's the plot.

261
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,766
Speaker 0: And in fact, I busted into this police station and there's a guy talking to another guy.

262
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:52,820
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, I saw this movie.

263
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,260
Speaker 1: I'll buy that for a dollar.

264
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,940
Speaker 0: I saw this movie about a guy who got shot and he was a cop and then they made him into some kind of like Robocop.

265
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,959
Speaker 0: I don't remember what the movie was called, but yo dog, it's set in Detroit and the other cops like, yeah, I guess I haven't seen it.

266
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,582
Speaker 0: I don't know.

267
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:10,591
Speaker 0: OK, then I tase both of them and hacked their computers and read their email.

268
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:10,940
Speaker 1: Right.

269
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,340
Speaker 1: So in other gaming news, right, there's a game that was released on GOG.com recently.

270
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,940
Speaker 1: that too much fanfare.

271
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,620
Speaker 1: You know, they put out a lot of games to much fanfare or too much fanfare.

272
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:23,507
Speaker 1: Too much.

273
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:24,740
Speaker 1: Both.

274
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:27,620
Speaker 1: OK, called Syndicate and Syndicate.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,589
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

276
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,280
Speaker 0: Fuck that game.

277
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,640
Speaker 1: I'd never heard of this game.

278
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:31,145
Speaker 1: Really?

279
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:32,097
Speaker 1: No, hold on.

280
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,462
Speaker 1: Let me finish.

281
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:39,918
Speaker 1: It's already really it's like, yeah, you know, I'm saying I had never heard of this game until at RIT.

282
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,320
Speaker 1: Alex is like some game he remembered from some time.

283
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,022
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

284
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:48,400
Speaker 0: So my really that you didn't hear about the game till RIT stands.

285
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,141
Speaker 1: All right.

286
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:50,890
Speaker 1: But, you know, it was like he was.

287
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,626
Speaker 1: Alex is trying to remember some game and he could never remember it.

288
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,440
Speaker 1: And then eventually he remembered it was Syndicate.

289
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,980
Speaker 1: And everyone was and some people were like, oh, yeah, that game.

290
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,344
Speaker 1: And that was that.

291
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:07,620
Speaker 1: And I just, you know, and the game again, been well, you know, people it was one of those games that was remembered as being awesome and old.

292
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:08,650
Speaker 0: So I have a question for you.

293
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,135
Speaker 0: Did you play it?

294
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,123
Speaker 0: So because if you I just want to ask you a pointed question, then you can tell your story.

295
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:14,355
Speaker 1: So I went on GOG.com.

296
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:16,299
Speaker 0: Completely incomprehensible.

297
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,263
Speaker 0: You didn't know what to do.

298
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:22,980
Speaker 1: So I went on GOG.com and the game came out and it was really, you know, popular.

299
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,500
Speaker 1: And, you know, it was such a heralded old game.

300
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,440
Speaker 1: I'm like, I should, you know, I should know this game.

301
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,200
Speaker 1: So I paid what, six bucks for it.

302
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:29,503
Speaker 1: Right.

303
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:30,679
Speaker 1: And I got it.

304
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,939
Speaker 1: I started playing it and it kind of worked.

305
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,362
Speaker 1: Yeah.

306
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:35,739
Speaker 1: And it was sort of excomish.

307
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:36,505
Speaker 0: Sort of.

308
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:37,219
Speaker 0: But it's real time.

309
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,403
Speaker 1: But it's real time.

310
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:42,096
Speaker 1: And it was actually first.

311
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,320
Speaker 1: I sort of died immediately.

312
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,280
Speaker 1: I was like, what the hell just happened?

313
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,200
Speaker 0: Because you guys kind of stand in there and someone shoots at him.

314
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,152
Speaker 0: He doesn't do anything.

315
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:47,820
Speaker 0: And then you're right.

316
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,049
Speaker 1: So then I went on the Internet and I looked at the controls because they don't give any instructions.

317
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,820
Speaker 1: That's a big problem.

318
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,880
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh, right click on guys to shoot them.

319
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,725
Speaker 1: Why didn't you tell me?

320
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:59,140
Speaker 1: So then I was killing everyone like doo doo doo, because I just gave everyone shotguns.

321
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,520
Speaker 0: About half those people are civilians.

322
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,540
Speaker 1: I went, no, I just went in with shotguns.

323
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,360
Speaker 1: I was like, boom, dead, boom, boom.

324
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,420
Speaker 0: Because who were you shooting?

325
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,680
Speaker 0: Because most of the people in most missions are civilians.

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,628
Speaker 1: These are all bad guys.

327
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,519
Speaker 1: They're all shooting at me.

328
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,285
Speaker 1: They're all guards.

329
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,220
Speaker 1: My mission was to assassinate somebody.

330
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:13,046
Speaker 1: Oh.

331
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,320
Speaker 1: So I just went in with the shotguns.

332
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,800
Speaker 1: I was like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

333
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:18,064
Speaker 1: But.

334
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,619
Speaker 1: There's one major flaw in this game.

335
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:24,016
Speaker 1: When you go inside a building, you can't see in the building up.

336
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,540
Speaker 1: And I went to online like, oh, how do I see inside the buildings?

337
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:28,283
Speaker 1: You can't.

338
00:15:28,986 --> 00:15:36,465
Speaker 1: And it's like I went in this building and like the building had like some sort of conveyor belt or something, because all my guys kept walking in a circle in the building and I couldn't get them out.

339
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,820
Speaker 1: And there's a bad guy in the building who shot all my guys.

340
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:39,657
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the fuck?

341
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:45,202
Speaker 0: And that game, because the actual game is actually pretty incomprehensible and difficult to control.

342
00:15:45,282 --> 00:15:50,320
Speaker 1: The other thing I read in the instructions is that like there's these three stats you control on your guys, but the drugs change.

343
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:50,501
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:51,799
Speaker 1: The change is how they behave.

345
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:59,539
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the blasters in X-Wing where you got to like like you can scale them back and make your guys suck, but then you build up kind of a laser.

347
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,240
Speaker 1: So I read all about that, but I didn't really need it for the first mission, because in the first mission, I could just right click and shoot everyone.

348
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:04,523
Speaker 1: Yeah.

349
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:05,860
Speaker 1: But two of my guys died.

350
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,900
Speaker 1: And I was like, fuck, I spent all my money to get more guys, giving those guys.

351
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,820
Speaker 1: Well, I had some extra guys, but you could only send four on a mission.

352
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,740
Speaker 1: But yes, the point is, I had six, two died, so I was still good.

353
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,754
Speaker 0: But the game had the RTS problem of.

354
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:19,560
Speaker 0: I've got four guys.

355
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:24,480
Speaker 0: The only strategy I ever had in that game was select all four and always attack only one.

356
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,102
Speaker 1: Exactly.

357
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,240
Speaker 1: But it's like I went in with four guys, two died.

358
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,284
Speaker 1: I had to buy two more.

359
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:33,082
Speaker 1: I just put cybernetic implants in two of those guys and now they're gone.

360
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,100
Speaker 1: So I was like, I learned immediately on the first mission.

361
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,439
Speaker 1: First of all, I started the game over because there's only one mission in.

362
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like never give everyone cybernetic implants.

363
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,740
Speaker 1: No bother researching just research weapons and equipment.

364
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,200
Speaker 0: No, you need the cybernetic implants, but they're good.

365
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,248
Speaker 1: Everyone's going to die.

366
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,420
Speaker 1: And I'm just going to lose all that money.

367
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,300
Speaker 1: So until I'm getting big income, don't buy in that game.

368
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,707
Speaker 1: I get because I didn't need.

369
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:57,240
Speaker 1: I gave everyone cyber legs thinking they would move fast and it worked, but they still died.

370
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:58,546
Speaker 1: Some of them, not all of them.

371
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:02,400
Speaker 1: So the strategy, I'm not going to waste money upgrading everyone on like the mission.

372
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,063
Speaker 1: I don't need it.

373
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:06,767
Speaker 0: One, you know, you can use that thing to get like civilians just to like follow you and help out.

374
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:08,460
Speaker 1: I didn't get past like the second mission.

375
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:16,281
Speaker 0: Oh, I'd walk around maps where there's civilians just gathering like an army of civilians and just use them as cannon fodder and then I'd bring them all back with me or whatever.

376
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:21,680
Speaker 0: But two, I would get nothing but Gatling guns and give everybody Gatling guns.

377
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even have.

378
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,300
Speaker 1: you know, you know, I only started it.

379
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,144
Speaker 1: So I didn't have Gatling guns.

380
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:31,199
Speaker 1: I had shotguns and I gave everyone a scanner and a med kit and, you know, whatever, a pistol, whatever else you can get.

381
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,351
Speaker 1: But I was then I started researching automatic weapons and I was like, well, how much should I spend on research?

382
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,179
Speaker 1: I don't even fucking know.

383
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:43,739
Speaker 1: So I just spent until it looked like the syndicate cost benefit ratio is about as unforgiving as Age of Steam.

384
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,905
Speaker 0: So take that as you will.

385
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:45,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty.

386
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:51,480
Speaker 0: it's another one of those things like XCOM where you need to take this core concept and just bring it into the modern era.

387
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,514
Speaker 1: Well, I think this is something I've noticed about GOG.com.

388
00:17:54,554 --> 00:18:02,860
Speaker 1: is that when someone's making a remake of a game and someone is making a syndicate remake, I'm not sure if it's going to be anything like the original, but, you know, it'll be the same universe and the same.

389
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:04,500
Speaker 1: the word syndicate will be in the title.

390
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:04,982
Speaker 1: Right.

391
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:11,040
Speaker 1: Is that what they tend to do is they'll tend to take the old version and put it on GOG.com and then come out with the remake.

392
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,722
Speaker 1: So it's like, let's remake XCOM and put the old XCOM on GOG, you know, that's what they tend to do.

393
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:20,040
Speaker 0: Man, if only, you know, other media people would do the exact same thing.

394
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,879
Speaker 0: I mean, when Robocop was popular again, why didn't someone just like immediately re-release Robocop on Blu-ray?

395
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's like, hey, if you're going to make a Robocop remake, you know, like they made a Clash of the Titans remake.

396
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:31,723
Speaker 1: Right.

397
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,332
Speaker 0: And why wasn't the old one?

398
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,600
Speaker 1: another make this big?

399
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
Speaker 1: Now they're making a sequel to the remake.

400
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:48,106
Speaker 1: They should have at the same time just put the old one out there on like Netflix and every streaming service and maybe sell it for like a dollar on iTunes or any download places and just been like this way.

401
00:18:48,206 --> 00:19:01,294
Speaker 1: everyone will see the old one, you know, like it'll just get the most exposure and basically will use the old one as number one, you'll profit by making some money off the old one because you get paid for those watches on Netflix and for those one dollar downloads

402
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:01,760
Speaker 0: and whatever.

403
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,160
Speaker 1: And it's basically just advertising the new one.

404
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,458
Speaker 1: But no one does that.

405
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:10,768
Speaker 1: They're still, you know, they keep the old one close to the chest and try to sell it for 15 bucks.

406
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,579
Speaker 1: It's like, what the fuck?

407
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:17,398
Speaker 0: So remember, I was playing a Binding of Isaac and it's fun, but it's the kind of game where I really want to play it unlike my DS.

408
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,660
Speaker 0: Like it's not a game I would just sit down and play as my primary activity in my house.

409
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,179
Speaker 1: I played a little bit and then I stopped.

410
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:26,340
Speaker 0: Thing is, it looks like Zelda.

411
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:32,340
Speaker 0: It's not really Zelda and it looks like Robotron, but really at its core, it's NetHack.

412
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,360
Speaker 1: Well, it has shootings.

413
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:42,869
Speaker 0: It's more like Doom, it's more like NetHack, though, or like or like Dragon Crystal or all those NetHack ish roguelike kind of games.

414
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:48,620
Speaker 0: in terms of like the you mean roguelike games and the items and all the items are incomprehensible.

415
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,038
Speaker 0: I can't have to use and figure them out.

416
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,259
Speaker 0: And every run is a unique run and all that stuff.

417
00:19:53,882 --> 00:20:00,720
Speaker 0: But there was the bullshit that when I bought the game and I clicked on it to set up my gamepad and it had gamepad as an option.

418
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,039
Speaker 0: When I selected gamepad, it said download Joy to Key.

419
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:05,616
Speaker 1: Oh, Bobo said the same thing.

420
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,300
Speaker 0: That's what I was getting at here.

421
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,840
Speaker 0: So Bobo and Binding of Isaac did not have gamepad support.

422
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Speaker 0: A Bobo I kind of understand because it was a flash game, whatever.

423
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,300
Speaker 1: I didn't know it was going to be a flash game.

424
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,966
Speaker 1: I was disappointed.

425
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,240
Speaker 1: I thought it was going to be a downloading game.

426
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:24,819
Speaker 0: But the fact that Joy to Key is their answer to this.

427
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,451
Speaker 0: Seriously, Joy to Key looks like now.

428
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,840
Speaker 0: I know that the actual Joy to Key, if you get the legitimate version, does not appear to be malware or anything.

429
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,362
Speaker 0: It's fine.

430
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:37,280
Speaker 0: But good God, does it have all the trappings of malware.

431
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,819
Speaker 0: And good God, do not half of the places I found that claim to have a download of it pretty much straight up put malware in it.

432
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:53,660
Speaker 0: So to all you gamers who independently have computer problems, it's because you download shit like that, that you have computer problems.

433
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,123
Speaker 0: That's right.

434
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,500
Speaker 0: I'm not saying Joy to Key is bad.

435
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,960
Speaker 0: I'm saying you are bad as a person if you trust something that looks like Joy to Key.

436
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,069
Speaker 1: Yep.

437
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:04,040
Speaker 1: I would never install Joy to Key on anything.

438
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,103
Speaker 1: I don't trust that shit.

439
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:14,319
Speaker 0: At least a Bobo linked directly to a download of the binary executable for Joy to Key as opposed to Binding of Isaac, which was like...

440
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,879
Speaker 1: How can you trust that link, though?

441
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,379
Speaker 0: I trust it slightly more.

442
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,219
Speaker 1: Slightly, but not much more.

443
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,321
Speaker 1: Right.

444
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:24,902
Speaker 1: I want to see, I would trust it if it was like, you know, an open source project or something.

445
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:28,820
Speaker 1: But it's like, still, don't make me use a separate thing like that.

446
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,480
Speaker 1: Friggin include the joystick support.

447
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,919
Speaker 1: It's not fucking hard.

448
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,626
Speaker 1: Do it.

449
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,099
Speaker 0: And also, you know, gamers out there.

450
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, Binding of Isaac is a fine game.

451
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,860
Speaker 0: It has this flaw, but it's otherwise a good game.

452
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:52,180
Speaker 0: Don't defend that flaw as a feature by saying something to me like, and I'm paraphrasing someone who actually said this to me, but the game really is better suited to being played on the keyboard.

453
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:53,177
Speaker 0: And no, fuck you.

454
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,078
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

455
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,040
Speaker 0: That'd be like if Google murdered a thousand poppies.

456
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,320
Speaker 0: You was like, yeah, well, you know, it's a lot better to do Google searches with your tongue than with the keyboard.

457
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,260
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, it's really best suited to the tongue interface.

458
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:08,219
Speaker 0: That wouldn't be a bad interface.

459
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:10,060
Speaker 1: It depends.

460
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:16,024
Speaker 1: Go ask someone who has to use their tongue because they have some, you know, disability of some sort.

461
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,620
Speaker 1: So ask them if they'd rather use a keyboard or their tongue.

462
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,999
Speaker 0: So did you play a Bobo?

463
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,512
Speaker 1: I played level one of a Bobo and then I died in level two and then I didn't play it again.

464
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:24,963
Speaker 0: Really?

465
00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:26,540
Speaker 0: I pretty much beat it in one go.

466
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,520
Speaker 0: It's actually super easy.

467
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,520
Speaker 1: I got electrocuted by the Teenage Uniginal Water electrocuted bits.

468
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,139
Speaker 0: So briefly, a Bobo, now that I played it all the way through, is a great one shot experience.

469
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:40,320
Speaker 0: It is a beautiful homage to NES gaming.

470
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,960
Speaker 0: It is very cleverly done homage.

471
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,500
Speaker 0: There are so many tiny little touches.

472
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,115
Speaker 0: And who the square boss is at the end is priceless.

473
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,859
Speaker 0: Absolutely priceless.

474
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:59,738
Speaker 0: However, many people have said things to the effect of, yes, it's an homage to Nintendo hard games.

475
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:12,962
Speaker 0: It is not Nintendo hard, but it gives a simulacrum of Nintendo hard like it has all the trappings of a Nintendo hard game, but without the actual Nintendo hard difficulty level.

476
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:21,980
Speaker 0: So someone who is not a hardcore old school gamer will play a Bobo and understand what Nintendo hard felt like without actually playing Ninja Gaiden.

477
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:36,340
Speaker 1: No, you can't understand what Nintendo hard feels like unless you play the same exact level over a hundred times using all your lives and all your continues, only to be sent back to the beginning of the game and then try it again every single day when you come from school for a whole month and then beat the level only once.

478
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,940
Speaker 1: And then once you get to the next level, it's so much harder.

479
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,160
Speaker 1: You die instantly and then you don't even know what to do.

480
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,927
Speaker 0: That is that experience is not available to modern kids, except for those who are very dedicated.

481
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,720
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

482
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:49,550
Speaker 1: It is available.

483
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,258
Speaker 1: You can just do it.

484
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,820
Speaker 1: The thing is, you have to do it.

485
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,304
Speaker 1: It has to be.

486
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:53,819
Speaker 0: Yes, but you know what?

487
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,640
Speaker 1: Can you do it or will you be distracted and go play Angry Birds?

488
00:23:57,301 --> 00:24:02,526
Speaker 0: I don't fault any kid for not doing it today because the only reason I did it back then is because that was it.

489
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,963
Speaker 1: I think you should force yourself to do it at least once.

490
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:08,240
Speaker 1: And in fact, I can recommend a Ninja Gaiden.

491
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:09,924
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

492
00:24:09,944 --> 00:24:15,084
Speaker 0: Hell, Mario three beat Mario three without warp whistles.

493
00:24:16,452 --> 00:24:17,437
Speaker 0: I've never actually done it.

494
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:19,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a game.

495
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:22,629
Speaker 0: Well, I've done it with save states, but that's not really Nintendo.

496
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,139
Speaker 1: What the hell is the name of that game?

497
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,482
Speaker 0: But a Bobo.

498
00:24:25,502 --> 00:24:32,185
Speaker 0: Is super fun and awesome, but I was personally disappointed for the same reasons.

499
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,539
Speaker 0: I was disappointed by Team Fortress two.

500
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:39,100
Speaker 0: It was such a great game, a Bobo, but it wasn't actually like I expected.

501
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,987
Speaker 0: I sat down like.

502
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:41,480
Speaker 0: this is going to be the hardest fucking thing ever.

503
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,125
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

504
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,525
Speaker 0: I'm going to play this game and I'm going to beat it no matter what.

505
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:46,599
Speaker 0: Then I beat it like in an hour.

506
00:24:47,342 --> 00:24:50,578
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, I guess there's no more Bobo.

507
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:57,098
Speaker 1: If you want to get that experience right, I would recommend playing Conquest of the Crystal Palace game.

508
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:57,705
Speaker 1: No.

509
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

510
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,319
Speaker 1: Do you even know what game that is?

511
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,800
Speaker 0: Actually, no, I'm thinking of Crystal Castle, so never mind.

512
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:06,407
Speaker 1: No, Conquest of the Crystal Palace was.

513
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:10,400
Speaker 1: it's an NES side scroll platform game, right?

514
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,960
Speaker 1: It's a lot simpler than Ninja Gaiden or Gayden.

515
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:22,040
Speaker 1: You start the game and there are like three crystal balls to choose from, like one's power, one's, you know, sort of like the beginning of what's it called?

516
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,964
Speaker 1: The Mickey Mouse game.

517
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:32,939
Speaker 1: Kingdom Hearts, where you can choose to be the one of the three and then you sort of walk sideways and hit things while platforming a lot like most games of that day.

518
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,666
Speaker 1: But it's like it's.

519
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:40,620
Speaker 1: you know, it's got that Nintendo hardness of Ninja Gayden, but it's not impossible hardness.

520
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,142
Speaker 1: Right.

521
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:45,320
Speaker 1: It's like so you can get the experience, but you'll still make progress.

522
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:47,460
Speaker 1: You will still actually get to the next level.

523
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,179
Speaker 1: And the bosses are just crazy awesome all over the place.

524
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,519
Speaker 0: Are they on the level of Mike Tyson's Punch Out bosses?

525
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:55,120
Speaker 1: They're pretty hilarious.

526
00:25:56,683 --> 00:25:57,330
Speaker 1: But not racist.

527
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,200
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

528
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:07,987
Speaker 0: So Sequelitis.

529
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,059
Speaker 0: Many people are fans of this, but if you are not, you will be now.

530
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
Speaker 0: Dude basically reviews.

531
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:16,246
Speaker 1: This is my thing today.

532
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,938
Speaker 1: I was going to use and I forgot to use.

533
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:20,379
Speaker 0: So Scott showed it to me.

534
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,268
Speaker 1: Burglar.

535
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:22,618
Speaker 1: Megaman, Megaman, Megaman.

536
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:23,418
Speaker 1: Turd burglar.

537
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,162
Speaker 1: This

538
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:45,634
Speaker 0: is one of the most succinct, intelligent, well-constructed explanations of at its core, what I hate about most modern games and what I like about a lot of old games and what makes a game good purely in the context of teaching the player what to do without forcing them to read a manual and without going

539
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,537
Speaker 1: Megaman, Megaman, those blacks are going to fall.

540
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,297
Speaker 1: You'd better not step on them.

541
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:50,778
Speaker 1: Yep.

542
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,539
Speaker 0: I don't want to even say anything else other than you should watch this.

543
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:02,240
Speaker 0: And to be sure, to be clear, to be fair, I watched a bunch more of the Sequelitis to make sure, you know, there's a chance someone might be a one trick pony.

544
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:07,280
Speaker 0: Now I pretty much agree with this guy on 99% of what he has to say.

545
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:13,159
Speaker 0: He is way smart and I'm going to do everything I can to trick him into doing a panel of packs if he's not already.

546
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:16,579
Speaker 1: So I saw a link to this.

547
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,097
Speaker 1: I haven't played it yet, so it might suck, but I don't know, but I'm going to find out tonight when I get home.

548
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,398
Speaker 1: Scott, Scott, Scott.

549
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,699
Speaker 1: The game might suck.

550
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,111
Speaker 1: It might.

551
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,076
Speaker 1: You better watch out.

552
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:28,099
Speaker 1: But it's going to be a thing of the day anyway.

553
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:30,420
Speaker 1: There is a game.

554
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,680
Speaker 1: It is a free mod for the Half-Life 2.

555
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,598
Speaker 1: You should have Half-Life 2 Episode 2 if you want all the textures and such, called Elevator Source.

556
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,838
Speaker 0: Chase told you about this.

557
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:39,800
Speaker 1: No, I saw it on the internet.

558
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,640
Speaker 0: Oh, because Chase invited us to a party where we're going to, as a group, play this game.

559
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:45,820
Speaker 1: Why play it as a group?

560
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:47,218
Speaker 0: Because it'll be more fun.

561
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,218
Speaker 1: Eh, whatever.

562
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,860
Speaker 1: Elevator Source is a single or co-op.

563
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,699
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess or co-op.

564
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:52,700
Speaker 1: Elevator Experience.

565
00:27:52,721 --> 00:27:53,480
Speaker 0: Have you looked at the game?

566
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,477
Speaker 0: Like, have you actually, like...

567
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,020
Speaker 1: That is different each time you play.

568
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,760
Speaker 1: What floor will you stop on next?

569
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,318
Speaker 1: What will happen?

570
00:27:58,441 --> 00:27:58,819
Speaker 1: Who knows?

571
00:27:58,961 --> 00:27:59,539
Speaker 1: We don't even know.

572
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,440
Speaker 1: And we made the game.

573
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:01,400
Speaker 1: It's that exciting.

574
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,860
Speaker 1: Up to 28 randomized floors to stop on with DLC packs in the future.

575
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,119
Speaker 1: Hopefully they'll also be free.

576
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,799
Speaker 1: A thrilling co-op experience, realistic elevator physics, cunning state-of-the-art AI that really goes into the elevator and waits.

577
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:15,600
Speaker 1: Real moral choices.

578
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,699
Speaker 1: What floor do you get off at?

579
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,439
Speaker 1: Do you ever get off?

580
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:19,439
Speaker 1: Only you are able to craft your elevator story.

581
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:24,640
Speaker 0: I'm actually a big fan of the games that are sort of experiences.

582
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,518
Speaker 0: I feel like this game is going to give me the same fun that We Didn't Play.

583
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:29,275
Speaker 0: 'Tis This Game Did.

584
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:35,559
Speaker 0: Where it's really, it's about the experience and the exploration and doing it with a bunch of friends and yelling.

585
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,460
Speaker 1: Want to create your own elevator floors?

586
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:38,179
Speaker 1: Check out the SDK.

587
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,719
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a mod for Garry's Mod.

588
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,019
Speaker 1: Does that mean I need Garry's Mod?

589
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,979
Speaker 0: Probably yes.

590
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,487
Speaker 0: Fuck.

591
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,639
Speaker 0: Just come to our party.

592
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,519
Speaker 0: We're gonna play this game as a group.

593
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:47,656
Speaker 1: Not interested.

594
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:52,300
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the book club books are not one, but two books.

595
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:54,900
Speaker 1: It's gonna be real soon, this book club.

596
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:56,160
Speaker 0: Maybe Thursday.

597
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:56,831
Speaker 1: Maybe.

598
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,837
Speaker 1: Did you finish it?

599
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,087
Speaker 0: Yeah.

600
00:28:58,522 --> 00:28:59,220
Speaker 0: Oh, let's do it Thursday.

601
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,260
Speaker 1: The books you need to read are one, The Little Prince, and two, Wind, Sand, and Stars, both of which are written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

602
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:12,280
Speaker 0: I have a lot to say about both of these books.

603
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:13,258
Speaker 0: I read them both.

604
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:14,180
Speaker 0: I took notes.

605
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:15,419
Speaker 1: I am ready to rock.

606
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:16,720
Speaker 1: One of them is crazy short.

607
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,279
Speaker 1: One of them is relatively short.

608
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,059
Speaker 1: They're both the awesomeness.

609
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:24,080
Speaker 1: If you didn't read them both by now, I mean, you've had enough time.

610
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,400
Speaker 1: I will say- What the fuck?

611
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,840
Speaker 0: I was pleasantly surprised.

612
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,140
Speaker 0: Wind, Sand, and Stars, I expected a certain thing, and for most of the book, I got that.

613
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,460
Speaker 0: And then at the end, he went somewhere very different.

614
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,160
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't really that different.

615
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,451
Speaker 0: No, no.

616
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,640
Speaker 0: Thematically, it wasn't.

617
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,159
Speaker 0: Actually, it kind of fit into everything.

618
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:43,500
Speaker 1: It was exactly the same.

619
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,600
Speaker 0: Thematically, it was the same.

620
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:50,760
Speaker 0: But in terms of, I don't know, I did not expect that part of the story to be what it was.

621
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,940
Speaker 0: I'm obviously not spoiling anything.

622
00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:00,220
Speaker 1: Maybe you should just save what you have to say for a show that we have to do instead of using all the material up and then not being able to- I have plenty of material.

623
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:00,877
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

624
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:05,619
Speaker 1: So, Strategery.

625
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:10,259
Speaker 0: I think, when I think of strategy guides- Do we have any other meta first?

626
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:10,827
Speaker 0: Nah.

627
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,374
Speaker 1: Okay.

628
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:12,440
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

629
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,999
Speaker 0: You want some meta?

630
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:13,456
Speaker 0: All right.

631
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:14,898
Speaker 0: Game of Thrones.

632
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:16,520
Speaker 1: That's not a meta moment.

633
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,580
Speaker 0: I made a mashup of Chunk from the Goonies and Tyrion from Game of Thrones, and Scott hasn't seen Game of Thrones.

634
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,378
Speaker 0: He doesn't know, but you should all watch Game of Thrones because it's basically a series of failed burning wheel rolls.

635
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,980
Speaker 1: So, if that's all the meta you got, then you don't got none.

636
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:46,640
Speaker 0: So I think, when I think strategy guide, there's really, there are two and only two, and these two strategy guides kind of epitomize everything that I think a strategy guide should be, and also why I hate pretty much all strategy guides.

637
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:51,620
Speaker 0: These are that Super Mario Brothers awesome book.

638
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,080
Speaker 1: The Mario 3 one that was on card stock.

639
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:55,780
Speaker 1: That was the one I had.

640
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,859
Speaker 1: That was the best.

641
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,417
Speaker 1: Unbelievable book.

642
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,500
Speaker 1: Well, it had so much history- I should try to buy it on eBay.

643
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:07,492
Speaker 0: I have two copies, and asides, and one's in mint condition, and one was read to fucking death.

644
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,900
Speaker 1: Mine was destroyed.

645
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,700
Speaker 0: In fact, I have all four of the original Nintendo Power strategy guides.

646
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,378
Speaker 0: Oh my God, here we go.

647
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,280
Speaker 1: Lot of four, right?

648
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,460
Speaker 1: Four player extra, Final Fantasy, Mario 3, and something else.

649
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,599
Speaker 1: Four Nintendo Power strategy guides, Final Fantasy, Mario 3, Ninja Gaiden 2, and these are going on eBay for 20 bucks.

650
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:27,198
Speaker 0: Okay.

651
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:29,840
Speaker 0: I own multiple copies of all of them.

652
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:37,343
Speaker 0: Anyway, the other one that really springs to mind as being the idea of what these should all strive to be.

653
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:45,819
Speaker 0: is that Final Fantasy 1 one, because let me tell you, it was pretty much as enjoyable to read that entire guide as it actually would be to play the stupid game.

654
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,560
Speaker 1: So, the thing with strategy guides, first I want to talk about, it's like, is it cheating?

655
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:52,460
Speaker 1: Right?

656
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:53,579
Speaker 1: It's like, you get this book.

657
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:54,418
Speaker 0: You know what?

658
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,380
Speaker 0: I'm going to say something.

659
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:56,100
Speaker 0: Very simple.

660
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,979
Speaker 0: I'm going to head you off.

661
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:59,740
Speaker 0: If we're talking about single player games- There is no cheating.

662
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,419
Speaker 0: There's no such thing.

663
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,399
Speaker 1: Unless you're cheating yourself.

664
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,540
Speaker 0: But that's not, that's a different kind of cheating.

665
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:03,838
Speaker 0: Who cares?

666
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,800
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, is it cheating?

667
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:12,411
Speaker 1: If I buy a crossword puzzle book and I just look in the back and copy all the answers to the front of the book, right?

668
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,480
Speaker 0: It's not cheating.

669
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:15,400
Speaker 0: It's just sad.

670
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,678
Speaker 1: It's like you're just cheating yourself out of the experience of solving the crossword puzzle.

671
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:35,740
Speaker 0: Or perhaps, for example, Final Fantasy 1, by getting kind of this awesome, very well put together explanation of everything that's going on and kind of reading ahead and spoiling some things for yourself, you could almost be enhancing the experience of the game.

672
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:44,240
Speaker 1: Well, and Final Fantasy 1 is the kind of game where you can literally just follow instructions and that will take you through the game, like the answer to a crossword puzzle.

673
00:32:44,581 --> 00:32:47,079
Speaker 1: But for Mario 3, you might know where to go.

674
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,719
Speaker 1: You might know where all the secrets are.

675
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,679
Speaker 1: You might know, you know, all this stuff.

676
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:55,160
Speaker 1: But you actually, at some point, there aren't enough P-wings and clouds.

677
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:57,080
Speaker 1: You actually have to do it.

678
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:04,139
Speaker 1: And if you use, say, a cloud and then a P-wing and then you die or something like that, you might have to do something else that you didn't, that you clouded.

679
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
Speaker 0: Scott, never cloud then P-wing.

680
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,860
Speaker 0: Always P-wing then cloud.

681
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:19,740
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, if you cloud some level and then you, you know, fuck it up, you might end up in a bad place and where you just wasted the cloud and the P-wing and now you have to actually beat levels with your skills.

682
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:27,339
Speaker 1: You know, the strategy guide isn't going to help your jump timing or your reflexes, which you will need to win.

683
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,740
Speaker 1: It's like I read a whole lot of strategy guides, especially fighting games.

684
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,819
Speaker 1: A fighting game, I think there's nothing wrong with the strategy guide, you know.

685
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,280
Speaker 0: Well, a strategy guide for a fighting game is basically just the real instruction book.

686
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,059
Speaker 1: It's like in the olden days, the fighting games didn't really come with instruction books.

687
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,938
Speaker 1: It's like, you maybe if you had the arcade cabinet, you would see, it would list the special moves in a little square and it wouldn't even give you all the special moves and only give you a few of them.

688
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:51,999
Speaker 1: And it wouldn't tell you any combos or anything.

689
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:57,679
Speaker 1: But even if you had that, it's like I saw, I knew that Hadouken was a quarter circle forward and a button press.

690
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:01,060
Speaker 1: I couldn't do one for the longest fucking time.

691
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,680
Speaker 1: I tried so much and I just like swinging the stick back and forth and jamming the punch button and maybe one would come out somewhere.

692
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,139
Speaker 1: It will not help you.

693
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,938
Speaker 1: It's just real instructions.

694
00:34:13,141 --> 00:34:20,280
Speaker 1: But in other games like Final Fantasy, or especially a point and click text adventure game, the strategy guide is the game.

695
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,938
Speaker 1: You can just read the strategy guide and not play.

696
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,458
Speaker 0: But I think the Final Fantasy I one, as an example, it had so much good art and stuff in it.

697
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,139
Speaker 0: It was kind of like an experience in and of itself.

698
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:40,300
Speaker 0: And I feel like the only strategy guides that I have a problem with are the ones that exist solely to make an otherwise unplayable game playable.

699
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, this isn't an unplayable game, but Ogre Battle 64 is a great game, actually.

700
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:51,100
Speaker 1: But it has all this crazy stuff that I haven't seen many other games have since.

701
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,478
Speaker 1: But my brother had that game and played it like crazy and he had the strategy guide for Nintendo Power.

702
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,519
Speaker 1: At least I think it was Nintendo Power.

703
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:03,839
Speaker 1: And you'd go through the strategy guide and you'd see shit in there and you'd be like, are you fucking kidding me?

704
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:11,540
Speaker 1: And the one that I remember specifically was the most powerful unit in the game was like this angel unit that you could get in your army to get the angel unit.

705
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,278
Speaker 1: You had to get this.

706
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:16,780
Speaker 1: There's a clock and a calendar in the game, right?

707
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:29,780
Speaker 1: You had to go to a certain map, which is a very early map, an early map in the game, go into it on a certain day on the in-game calendar at a certain time, go to a certain house at that time and do a certain thing.

708
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:36,420
Speaker 1: There was no way to know that in the fucking universe without freaking reading that strategy guide.

709
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:45,913
Speaker 1: You cannot convince me that anyone in the history of the world who has played that game has ever figured out to do that and did it without looking it up in the strategy guide, right?

710
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,219
Speaker 1: It's just impossible that you would know that.

711
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:51,739
Speaker 1: So it's like you could beat the game and you could have tons of fun with it.

712
00:35:52,201 --> 00:36:00,840
Speaker 1: But there are a lot of things they put in that game that are just complete arbitrary bullshit that are in the game that is sealed by this.

713
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,439
Speaker 1: It's almost like the strategy guide was like a DLC.

714
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,000
Speaker 1: It's like this stuff in the game already, it's unlocked DLC.

715
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,777
Speaker 1: It's already, we already gave it to you.

716
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,540
Speaker 1: But even though it's unlocked, you won't know where to find it.

717
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,440
Speaker 1: It's the most hidden of hidden, hidden.

718
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,380
Speaker 1: So the instructions on how to find that hidden, hidden, hidden cost 10 bucks.

719
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,980
Speaker 0: Do not strategy guides that serve that sole purpose and no other purpose.

720
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,320
Speaker 0: It also told you no longer have any sort of reasonable means of selling in light of the internet.

721
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:30,380
Speaker 1: Well, that's true.

722
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,000
Speaker 1: It did have real strategies in it, first of all, right?

723
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,940
Speaker 1: For the regular game.

724
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,857
Speaker 1: It just also had that.

725
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:35,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

726
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,600
Speaker 0: But I mean, all that nowadays, all that stuff is on game facts or something anyway.

727
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

728
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,459
Speaker 1: Which is why I think the strategy game market has gone pretty downhill ever since the game facts came out.

729
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,860
Speaker 1: No, the thing is- A lot less people are buying strategy guides.

730
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,980
Speaker 0: I never actually really use strategy guides to learn about games that I played.

731
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:01,439
Speaker 0: I use them to explore games that I wasn't actually ever going to buy or play or games that I rented once and it was kind of fun and then I didn't buy it.

732
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:12,951
Speaker 0: So what I do is when Nintendo Power reviewed the game, I kind of live vicariously through Nintendo Power by looking at all the crazy levels that were later I didn't get to and looking at what the ending is and all the codes and all the BS.

733
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:20,400
Speaker 0: and it was very similar to now when I said that I pirated Poker Night at the Inventory by watching all the cut scenes on YouTube.

734
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, back in those days, right?

735
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,259
Speaker 1: It's like now there's such an abundance of video games.

736
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:28,520
Speaker 1: You don't need to live a video game vicariously.

737
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:38,100
Speaker 0: And if you do, because I've found a lot of people, I enjoy watching someone play some kinds of games, 95 percent as much as I would just playing the games themselves.

738
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:43,908
Speaker 0: So that's why we have this popularity of like Dave and Joel live streaming stuff when they play like Fatal Frame or something.

739
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,075
Speaker 0: or let's play.

740
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,940
Speaker 1: In the olden days, you had an NES and you have a lot of money.

741
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,239
Speaker 1: You didn't buy every NES game for 50 bucks each.

742
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:54,840
Speaker 1: You only own so many games and your friends only had so many games.

743
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,057
Speaker 1: There are a lot of games you would never play or you didn't even hear of or like would never be in the store near you.

744
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:12,020
Speaker 1: And you know, you'd go to the book fair in your elementary school and for five, ten bucks, you would buy a strategy guide that had, you know, how to beat like, you know, or at least tips and tricks for hard parts of like a bunch of different games.

745
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,899
Speaker 0: Do you have that one, the yellow paperback book that was just text that was like codes and tricks?

746
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,859
Speaker 1: No, I had ones that had pictures in them.

747
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:19,679
Speaker 0: I had those too.

748
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,779
Speaker 1: A blue one and a red one.

749
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:23,318
Speaker 1: They were all... They were sort of thin, but they were big.

750
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:24,580
Speaker 0: I remember those too.

751
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:32,697
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid, all the off brand, like non Nintendo Power were pretty much ghetto, not only ghetto, but often wrong.

752
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,859
Speaker 0: Like as a kid, I'd look at them and be like, that's not right.

753
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:36,460
Speaker 0: That code doesn't do anything.

754
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:37,399
Speaker 0: That's wrong.

755
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,079
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

756
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:39,239
Speaker 1: Yeah.

757
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,480
Speaker 1: The Nintendo Power ones, they really put the extra effort, you know, into making it complete.

758
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,740
Speaker 0: Like I said, it was the polish.

759
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,760
Speaker 1: Like it told you, it showed you every pixel of every map.

760
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,440
Speaker 1: It told you what was in every mushroom house.

761
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,939
Speaker 1: It told you every bad guy you could see right there.

762
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,820
Speaker 1: You know, it showed everything.

763
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,040
Speaker 1: Every piece of information about the entire game was in there.

764
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,740
Speaker 0: It let you explore the game.

765
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,280
Speaker 0: Because remember, there's the mechanical aspect of playing a game like Mario 3, but there's also the exploratory aspect.

766
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,479
Speaker 0: Like when I was flipping through that guy...

767
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,159
Speaker 1: You were never going to go to those ice world levels with the fireball and burn your way into all those, you know, ice blocks to go in all those pipes to see what's in there.

768
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:17,740
Speaker 0: But when I saw Curry Bow's motherfucking shoe in that guy, I was like, what is this?

769
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,219
Speaker 1: I had gotten the shoe before.

770
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:21,360
Speaker 0: I didn't get the shoe.

771
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:21,959
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

772
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,599
Speaker 0: I think I just ended up always skipping that level.

773
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:28,780
Speaker 1: No, see, I would go because I would warp to level five because I didn't know the third whistle.

774
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:29,799
Speaker 1: I only needed two whistles.

775
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,660
Speaker 0: I was obsessed with World 4, the giant world, so I'd always go there just because it was crazy.

776
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:36,380
Speaker 1: I would, you know, I just like the giant level.

777
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,500
Speaker 0: I never wouldn't, you know, that's a separate discussion.

778
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,739
Speaker 0: How as a kid, I often wouldn't even try to beat those games.

779
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,130
Speaker 1: Have we done a Mario 3 show?

780
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:44,078
Speaker 1: I don't know.

781
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,360
Speaker 0: I would just kind of dick around.

782
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:54,471
Speaker 0: Like I'd go to World 4 because World 4 was fun and just play around, then I'd go get Curry Bow's shoe and then I'd peter around and stuff on the pipe world till I got sick of it.

783
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,578
Speaker 0: Then I turned the Nintendo off.

784
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,128
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

785
00:39:56,942 --> 00:39:58,258
Speaker 1: Anyway, because you couldn't be because you suck.

786
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,180
Speaker 0: I beat Mario 3, but I've never beaten it without using at least one warp whistle.

787
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:07,078
Speaker 1: Well, you're allowed to use whistles, you're just not allowed to use any cheating, like save states.

788
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,740
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's trivial to beat Mario 3 if you just, you know, use warp whistles.

789
00:40:13,122 --> 00:40:14,859
Speaker 1: No, because you get the last level, they need to beat it.

790
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:16,740
Speaker 0: The last level is actually pretty easy.

791
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:21,479
Speaker 0: I have a lot of trouble with some of the levels leading up to it, which is why I need three P-wings or I can't do it.

792
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,099
Speaker 1: I've managed, I used to need P-wings when I was a kid, but I need less P-wings now than No, Scott, I will say this.

793
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,480
Speaker 0: As a kid, I really, like beating the game was never really my goal.

794
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,820
Speaker 0: After I'd beaten the game a few times even, like I didn't care about beating the game.

795
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:39,879
Speaker 0: I cared about getting the tanooki suit and the hammer suit and then using them as much.

796
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,480
Speaker 1: I didn't even know there was a hammer suit.

797
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,280
Speaker 1: Like the hammer suit to me was one of those things that was like a rumor.

798
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:49,080
Speaker 1: Like, you know, oh my God, people get naked in, you know, these games.

799
00:40:49,261 --> 00:40:51,260
Speaker 1: It was like one of those bullshit rumors that kids spread.

800
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,620
Speaker 0: I knew about the hammer suit.

801
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:52,943
Speaker 0: Right.

802
00:40:53,246 --> 00:40:54,620
Speaker 1: And it was like Nintendo Power.

803
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:03,460
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying it's like, you know, it's one of those things like Pete, in those days, you couldn't get reliable information and people with kids would spread all kinds of misinformation every game.

804
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,143
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

805
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:07,980
Speaker 1: You can get Nudalities in Mortal Kombat 2.

806
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:18,683
Speaker 0: If you go to the top of that tower in Final Fantasy six or I guess three back then and you walk around it like seven thousand times, then General Leo comes back from the dead.

807
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:20,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you will spread all kinds of shit.

808
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:24,080
Speaker 1: So the idea of a hammer suit was just like, yeah, it's some made up bullshit.

809
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,120
Speaker 1: And then I got the strategy guide and it was like, there is a hammer suit.

810
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,411
Speaker 1: Here is where to get it.

811
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,400
Speaker 1: Here's what it does.

812
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,599
Speaker 1: And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

813
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,320
Speaker 0: I was obsessed as a kid with getting all the weird power ups just to get them.

814
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,680
Speaker 0: And once I got them, I kind of wouldn't know what to do with myself.

815
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,918
Speaker 0: Like I'd never actually want to use them.

816
00:41:41,963 --> 00:41:43,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I got the hammer suit.

817
00:41:43,483 --> 00:41:45,120
Speaker 1: I do not want to lose this hammer suit.

818
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,624
Speaker 0: Because back then I had not yet seen Nausicaa Valley of the Wind, so I did not have my favorite quote.

819
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:51,657
Speaker 0: If not now, then when?

820
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,942
Speaker 1: Exactly.

821
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:58,019
Speaker 1: But then you get that hammer suit, you turn it on and you throw a hammer at a Thwomp and it kills him.

822
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,540
Speaker 1: You're like, oh, shit.

823
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,480
Speaker 0: When that happened, I literally got killed by a Podburos because I stopped.

824
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,286
Speaker 0: I was like, what?

825
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:05,780
Speaker 0: That's right.

826
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,138
Speaker 1: Hammers kill Thwomps.

827
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:11,240
Speaker 0: The saddest thing was I'd lose the hammer suit almost right away.

828
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:13,840
Speaker 1: Even though if you crouched in it, you were almost invincible.

829
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,839
Speaker 0: I know, but I'd have to eventually stop crouching.

830
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:19,558
Speaker 1: Start throwing hammers anyway.

831
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,940
Speaker 0: So do strategy guides have a place at all in the modern world?

832
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:29,280
Speaker 0: Or because, look, the mechanical aspects of telling you every individual detail about a game is covered by the Internet.

833
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:38,880
Speaker 0: The exploratory aspect of seeing the parts of the game you either couldn't get to, wouldn't get to, didn't care about, didn't know in the game is also covered by the Internet.

834
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:39,343
Speaker 1: Yep.

835
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:41,480
Speaker 0: And that's it.

836
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:48,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think in general, I mean, I don't see, like, good, well-designed strategy guide.

837
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,440
Speaker 0: Granted, I haven't gone to a GameStop in years.

838
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,240
Speaker 1: But even if you did, you would never even look at the strategy guides.

839
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,203
Speaker 1: You wouldn't even consider looking at them because they're completely unnecessary in the current day.

840
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:01,260
Speaker 1: You know, but in the olden days, they were very necessary.

841
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:14,640
Speaker 1: You couldn't get this information, you know, even just people would put codes in their games and then give the codes to magazines and then the magazines would use the fact that they had the codes in them as like a selling point, except now they're on the Internet already.

842
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:15,822
Speaker 1: Yep.

843
00:43:16,164 --> 00:43:16,848
Speaker 1: And it's like now.

844
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:19,039
Speaker 1: do games even really have codes anymore?

845
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:21,409
Speaker 0: A Bobo does.

846
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:22,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure it does.

847
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:28,020
Speaker 0: I was actually really disappointed in a Bobo that in the Zelda world there were no secret doors or anything.

848
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:30,860
Speaker 0: I pushed every fucking block and bombed every fucking thing.

849
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,499
Speaker 1: There was nothing good that I won't do it.

850
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:37,322
Speaker 0: Well, not bombs, but I did the I assume to be like second quest for bombs or candle action.

851
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:42,580
Speaker 0: There is something reminiscent of candle action, but it's not you.

852
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:44,600
Speaker 0: It's basically one dungeon.

853
00:43:45,383 --> 00:43:47,240
Speaker 0: The only great thing is the shape of the dungeon.

854
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,920
Speaker 0: And then I guess what happens to your sword.

855
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:50,903
Speaker 1: Great.

856
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:53,358
Speaker 0: And what happens when you meet a man in a cave?

857
00:43:56,183 --> 00:43:56,989
Speaker 1: I got something.

858
00:43:57,372 --> 00:43:58,300
Speaker 1: It's a secret to everybody.

859
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,776
Speaker 1: Pay me for the door repair charge.

860
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:10,244
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm still to this day, I mean, I wore out between me and my little brother, the Final Fantasy one strategy guide, because we just read it like over and over again.

861
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:11,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read Mario three one.

862
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,360
Speaker 1: Mario three one was destroyed.

863
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,732
Speaker 1: The other ones had a lot of games with them that I never played, like Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom.

864
00:44:17,874 --> 00:44:18,320
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

865
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:19,674
Speaker 0: I played that game or Monster.

866
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,886
Speaker 1: What was the game?

867
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:21,998
Speaker 1: Monster something.

868
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,639
Speaker 1: Oh, what the fuck is this game?

869
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,523
Speaker 0: What game?

870
00:44:24,986 --> 00:44:27,440
Speaker 1: It was a game that like few people have actually played.

871
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,820
Speaker 0: I have no idea what you're talking Monster Party.

872
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,367
Speaker 1: Monster Party.

873
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,100
Speaker 1: There was a strategy guide for Monster Party.

874
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,459
Speaker 1: And I read that and I was like, oh, shit, are you kidding me?

875
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:35,863
Speaker 1: It was.

876
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:36,660
Speaker 1: it looked so cool.

877
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,190
Speaker 1: And it was actually playing those games.

878
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:41,460
Speaker 1: now, you know, not necessarily as good.

879
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:50,482
Speaker 1: But the experience that I got, the idea I got of those games, reading the strategy guide for them and seeing all the parts of them was way better than actually playing them.

880
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:51,186
Speaker 0: Yep.

881
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,140
Speaker 1: Wizards and Warriors, all of them.

882
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,808
Speaker 1: I've read strategy.

883
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:54,439
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

884
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,600
Speaker 0: Fucking Wizards and Warriors.

885
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,080
Speaker 0: That was all three of them was incomprehensible and impossible.

886
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,400
Speaker 1: Like that second one was even harder with the elements.

887
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,500
Speaker 1: It was so fun in the strategy guide because like, oh, he's fighting the fire boss.

888
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,486
Speaker 1: Oh, he's fighting the earth boss.

889
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:09,946
Speaker 1: I never got to any boss actually playing those games.

890
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:10,540
Speaker 1: Impossible.

891
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,940
Speaker 0: Remember, Wizards and Warriors three with different classes, like you turn into the thief to walk by the giant and then you turn into the impossible.

892
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:17,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

893
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:22,463
Speaker 0: I couldn't figure out what was going on in that game and you couldn't save as far as I could tell.

894
00:45:22,503 --> 00:45:23,409
Speaker 0: I remember I'd like like.

895
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:29,503
Speaker 0: I started the game like Friday night and then I paused it when I went to bed, praying to all the gods that it would unpause in the morning.

896
00:45:29,946 --> 00:45:34,140
Speaker 1: And there are other games that were just like, you know, the kind of games that people don't make anymore.

897
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,979
Speaker 1: Nowadays, people make beatable games.

898
00:45:36,221 --> 00:45:37,991
Speaker 1: And I'm not even talking about this kind of stuff.

899
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:41,520
Speaker 1: I talked about with Ogre Battle, where the game has some secret you're never going to find.

900
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,404
Speaker 1: It's just the game.

901
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:45,420
Speaker 1: The instruction book just doesn't give you enough information.

902
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,225
Speaker 1: There's no map.

903
00:45:46,486 --> 00:45:48,940
Speaker 1: There's just not enough to go on like syndicate.

904
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:50,082
Speaker 1: Right.

905
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:58,639
Speaker 1: There is not enough to go on to to really get anywhere in the game without some more information like Legacy of the Wizard or something like that.

906
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:11,129
Speaker 1: You know, it's like you need some help to be able to beat that game unless you just, you know, try everything and just make your own maps and go crazy and devote like your whole life to it.

907
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:11,960
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

908
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,600
Speaker 0: I remember Legacy of the Wizard.

909
00:46:14,182 --> 00:46:20,900
Speaker 1: Were you, you know, you'd be walking and you'd see the awesome sword, but you couldn't get to it because it's underneath your feet in that little box and the dragon to be there.

910
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,300
Speaker 1: But he'd be asleep and you'd do a thing to get him to awaken.

911
00:46:23,462 --> 00:46:24,680
Speaker 1: But only after you got the sword.

912
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:30,000
Speaker 1: And you can get to go all the way back to the beginning of the game all the time to change between the different family members.

913
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:34,844
Speaker 1: And you would use like the little pet or the, you know, the girl and the kid who could jump.

914
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:36,740
Speaker 1: But the dad had the awesome weapon.

915
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,543
Speaker 1: He could break shit.

916
00:46:37,683 --> 00:46:49,776
Speaker 0: And so I'd recommend if you, you know, if you want to experience a little bit of what it was like to be a kid in the 80s playing NES games, get the Final Fantasy one strategy guide or the Mario three strategy guide, a game.

917
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:53,160
Speaker 1: you get a strategy guide for a game you haven't played or that you don't remember.

918
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,940
Speaker 0: Maybe you played a little, but you didn't get very far into it.

919
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,526
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll.

920
00:46:57,927 --> 00:47:05,523
Speaker 0: you'll be surprised how fun it is to kind of read all the crazy stuff because some of these NES games are actually a lot more complex than they would lead you to believe.

921
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:07,500
Speaker 1: Go on eBay, buy an old strategy guide.

922
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,393
Speaker 1: Don't buy some new one.

923
00:47:08,414 --> 00:47:08,739
Speaker 1: Right.

924
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,649
Speaker 0: Go buy the old strategy guide for something or play that retro game master game on the game on the DS.

925
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:22,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'll give you sort of a hint, but it's not, you know, that's a simulacrum of the experience, much like a Bobo is a simulacrum of Nintendo Heart.

926
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,655
Speaker 1: Exactly.

927
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:31,800
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

928
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,103
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

929
