Speaker 1: Tonight at the game shows Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:32,022
Speaker 1: Been biking to work every day as I say a lot at the beginning of the show, but I've run into some trouble Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:41,620
Speaker 1: So I don't ride my real bike because due to my building's Union Shenanigan bullshit, I can't actually take it up into the building and there's no way.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,020
Speaker 1: I'm parking my expensive bike out on the street in Midtown in the most bike steel in a city in the country.

9
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:48,484
Speaker 0: Yeah, my building.

10
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,357
Speaker 0: between the hours of 8 and 6 I can ride the elevator with my bike.

11
00:00:52,397 --> 00:00:53,219
Speaker 0: So I do yep.

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,636
Speaker 1: So I ride my mountain bike and I park it outside and I tie it to the.

13
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:57,560
Speaker 1: you know How?

14
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,403
Speaker 1: there's municipal like.

15
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:02,338
Speaker 1: you can just tie your bike to almost anything unless it's something that you obviously can't like.

16
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:05,188
Speaker 1: you can't put it On the fence outside a subway station.

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,060
Speaker 0: You can't tie it to the antenna on top of the Empire State Building.

18
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,044
Speaker 0: It's out of reach.

19
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:14,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's a little too big but like if you put it around certain kinds of private property They're you know, you can't do that.

20
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:23,020
Speaker 1: There's laws against that but there are Places you can guarantee to be able to do it for a bike rack the municipal bike racks and the municipal bike poles.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,887
Speaker 1: Yeah and one thing the city did a while ago and they're old but they're still there is on a lot of light poles at the Bottom is a little thing.

22
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,880
Speaker 1: You can put your bike lock through and it has this bike logo on it and everything.

23
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:39,513
Speaker 1: Yep, so there's a bunch of them right around my building one grand central place.

24
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, aka the former Lincoln building.

25
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,398
Speaker 1: so I parked my bike there outside.

26
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,240
Speaker 1: and Every day these union assholes come out of the building and yell at me and threaten to cut my bike down.

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,213
Speaker 1: They don't want me parking my bike anywhere near their building.

28
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:52,180
Speaker 0: call police.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,505
Speaker 1: So what I did?

30
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:56,778
Speaker 1: because the guy came out and actually threatened to cut my bike down one.

31
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,171
Speaker 1: I took a picture of him which freaked him the fuck out and then I was like I'm gonna call the police right now if you threaten me again.

32
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you say to that?

33
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:05,490
Speaker 1: Then he's like, come on blah blah blah.

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,073
Speaker 1: It's my job.

35
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,280
Speaker 1: I'm like, I don't care if my bike's gone.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,067
Speaker 1: I got a picture of you.

37
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:08,934
Speaker 1: I've got a picture of the bike.

38
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:09,598
Speaker 1: I'll call the police.

39
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, if my bike is fucking and I and you know what my bike was still there.

40
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:14,300
Speaker 0: That's right.

41
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:18,840
Speaker 1: So I lodged a complaint with the city and I lodged a complaint with the building through my HR department.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,580
Speaker 1: But I saw them over lunch today harassing some poor bike messenger who tied his bike to another municipal thing again next to the building.

43
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:30,211
Speaker 1: So fuck those guys fuck those guys But I'll win this one.

44
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,160
Speaker 0: that's that's the thing.

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,582
Speaker 0: You know.

46
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:34,960
Speaker 1: my bike seat is worth more than my bike and I carry the bike seat with me.

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,809
Speaker 1: so if they actually do steal my bike, I Will go all out to fuck them.

48
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,111
Speaker 0: Let's you know who did it and I'm not really out much Yeah, but yeah, it's in New York.

49
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,674
Speaker 0: There's a lot of.

50
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:49,940
Speaker 0: there's a lot of rules and You know, the unions are very strong here.

51
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,900
Speaker 0: But there are some rules that hold them back and hold various people back like taxis.

52
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,767
Speaker 0: They have to take you somewhere.

53
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:59,340
Speaker 1: However, I often pull bullshit to get anywhere out of the Javits.

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,026
Speaker 1: This isn't the airport.

55
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:07,500
Speaker 1: You basically have to lie and be like, yeah I'm going to the airport and we're just getting the cab be like actually no take me here And you got to be willing to call the police when they won't do it?

56
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,152
Speaker 0: Oh, no, actually don't need to call the police.

57
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,220
Speaker 1: You call that number in the cab.

58
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:15,180
Speaker 0: Well, you call three one one, right in New York You can always call three one one if it's not nine one one.

59
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,528
Speaker 0: But you still need to call something right.

60
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:18,560
Speaker 1: the other thing the cabbies do mess with people.

61
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,100
Speaker 1: They always quote unquote break their credit card machine.

62
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,340
Speaker 1: They're like, ah, it's not working and then they freak out and attack you if you don't have or won't give them cash.

63
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like you just got to fight for it.

64
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,954
Speaker 0: Sometimes if you're not willing to fight for it, you're gonna lose out.

65
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,566
Speaker 1: but the cool thing about Gotham Is that the laws are.

66
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,259
Speaker 1: if you know what the laws are you do win in the end?

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that they you know, and there's not.

68
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:38,871
Speaker 0: you know, there's.

69
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:41,664
Speaker 0: of course it's impossible to know all the laws Yeah, but there are.

70
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:44,233
Speaker 0: but there's plenty of laws that you can learn.

71
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:47,162
Speaker 0: that are the ones that matter for everyday Geekery.

72
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,512
Speaker 1: if you're an anime geek, you know about your anime.

73
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,480
Speaker 1: if you're a I don't know hentai geek.

74
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,790
Speaker 1: You know about the laws related to hentai in your jurisdiction.

75
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,960
Speaker 1: So if you're a biker, don't give me that jurors my addiction.

76
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,480
Speaker 1: I think there's a hentai about jurors in your dick.

77
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:06,840
Speaker 1: Anyway, so if you're a biker you got to know pretty much like you should be an expert on the bike laws.

78
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:12,854
Speaker 1: Yeah in your town if you'd have a car and you own it in Manhattan You'd better damn well know where you can park.

79
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:13,498
Speaker 1: cuz I don't know.

80
00:04:15,582 --> 00:04:17,880
Speaker 0: So anyway, I was speaking of biking yesterday.

81
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:23,987
Speaker 1: Oh, and I saw a guy riding a bike over the Queensborough Bridge on my way home And he was carrying another larger bike over his back.

82
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:24,689
Speaker 0: Nice.

83
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:33,100
Speaker 0: I was biking to work yesterday, right and There's like there's a crowd of people standing around and a guy laying on the ground.

84
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,884
Speaker 0: So I'm like up.

85
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:35,514
Speaker 0: is this guy having trouble?

86
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:36,500
Speaker 0: What's wrong with this guy?

87
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:45,458
Speaker 0: All right, so I stopped to check out and see what's wrong with this guy and I don't know He might have had a heat stroke or a very minor heart attack or who knows what right?

88
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,131
Speaker 0: He's complaining of chest pain couldn't breathe, you know, whatever.

89
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:50,472
Speaker 0: Yep.

90
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,960
Speaker 0: So some people calling on one one.

91
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:59,380
Speaker 0: I'm standing around thinking I know CPR and if he stops breathing, you know, I'll help him out.

92
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:06,000
Speaker 0: Plus I had read recently just supposed to do chest compressions and forget the whole mouth thing and then they have a better chance of survival.

93
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,024
Speaker 0: So I was like up.

94
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,109
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see what happens.

95
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm waiting there and his people around And then one guy's like I gotta go to work.

96
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:17,339
Speaker 0: You know the guys like I'm gonna go down and talk to the traffic cop at the end of the bridge.

97
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:20,571
Speaker 0: Another guy so suddenly just me and this guy.

98
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:21,976
Speaker 0: basically we're New Yorkers.

99
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:26,090
Speaker 1: We get bored quickly Like anything crazy is happening.

100
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,705
Speaker 1: everybody stops for like a second like whoa Okay, I gotta get to work.

101
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:33,200
Speaker 0: All right, so basically I'm standing with this guy and he's you know, he's recovering.

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,828
Speaker 0: He didn't he didn't die or need CPR, right?

103
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:39,560
Speaker 0: He was just probably heat-stroked and extremely exhausted.

104
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,280
Speaker 0: Right and he recovered.

105
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:50,040
Speaker 0: but I was basically standing there waiting for an ambulance to show up on the pedestrian part of the bridge for like over a half hour and It never showed lesson.

106
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:54,959
Speaker 0: Don't hurt yourself on the pedestrian part of the bridge because the ambulance will not get there.

107
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,582
Speaker 0: You know what?

108
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:59,520
Speaker 1: I'm very alone with the ambulance driving on the pedestrian part of that bridge to get to you.

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,193
Speaker 0: It didn't even but it didn't even like show that we didn't hear a siren nothing.

110
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:10,692
Speaker 0: There was no no no cops No, no, no one tried to come even though 911 was called Almost like 45 minutes to an hour.

111
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:11,960
Speaker 0: I left before it showed up.

112
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,660
Speaker 1: I think the moral there is don't ever need an ambulance.

113
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,088
Speaker 0: But I mean, it's like, you know, I guess it was the morning rush hour Who knows but it never it.

114
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,979
Speaker 0: I had to leave before it showed up But the guy was able to recover and walk down because to the end of the bridge yesterday

115
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:32,872
Speaker 1: I was walking to lunch and an old guy just like like he was walking in front of me and he just like fell Yeah on nothing and he was fine.

116
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,998
Speaker 1: I helped him up and he was.

117
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,420
Speaker 0: he tripped.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,840
Speaker 1: He didn't like no there was nothing to trip on walking and he didn't trip.

119
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:43,952
Speaker 1: It wasn't like his foot like went and then he thought it was but it was a fall It wasn't an aneurysm or he just felt a stroke.

120
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:45,256
Speaker 1: He fell straight down.

121
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,039
Speaker 1: All right, like.

122
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:50,473
Speaker 1: Then he got up and I was like you okay, and he's like leave me alone.

123
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,811
Speaker 1: And then I just like a fading goat Yeah, he didn't even faint just kind of like fell.

124
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,025
Speaker 0: All right, it was kind of I don't know Maybe it was a very minor seizure.

125
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,255
Speaker 1: and also today I saw a dude who was biking.

126
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,620
Speaker 1: Yep, and he just fell.

127
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, like he didn't hit anything.

128
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,840
Speaker 1: He was like riding and then his front he just like wobble falls over.

129
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,385
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

130
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:11,392
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened there.

131
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:15,929
Speaker 1: He was like he was young Reasonably fit on a normal bike bike was fine.

132
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,514
Speaker 1: I don't know what his deal was, but he just fell.

133
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:18,337
Speaker 0: that happens.

134
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,327
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

135
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:24,631
Speaker 1: All right, so There's some irony in my news today.

136
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:25,556
Speaker 1: It's this Thursday.

137
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:26,340
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
Speaker 1: So The irony I'll get to in a second.

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,089
Speaker 1: But here's an article pointing out that phone books are actually still a pretty big problem because people keep delivering them Despite the fact that no one uses them.

140
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,017
Speaker 0: No one uses what phone books.

141
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:40,720
Speaker 0: That's true.

142
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,164
Speaker 1: Yes, now the cool thing is I?

143
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:45,173
Speaker 1: well, I forgot that there's two kinds of phone books.

144
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:47,600
Speaker 1: There's the yellow pages and the white pages.

145
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,800
Speaker 1: So apparently no one uses the white pages like no one.

146
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,487
Speaker 0: That's right.

147
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,660
Speaker 1: and the yellow pages?

148
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:57,326
Speaker 1: Well, basically here's the deal.

149
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:01,119
Speaker 1: the article is talking about how the phone book delivery system is finally coming down.

150
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,586
Speaker 1: Books are finally starting to disappear.

151
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:06,655
Speaker 1: check out this obsolete antiquated shit finally going away.

152
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:09,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know who's reporting that USA today?

153
00:08:15,664 --> 00:08:19,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, but some gems from this article because I didn't really I better.

154
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,000
Speaker 0: I better report on this.

155
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,051
Speaker 0: You know these newfangled iPods.

156
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 0: here it the news reports coming over the ticker.

157
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:33,080
Speaker 0: Apparently People are getting music in some sort of digital format.

158
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:39,419
Speaker 1: So apparently get this the people who are really pushing for this because apparently took legislation to bring this stupid industry down.

159
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,222
Speaker 0: Oh, thank god.

160
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:42,229
Speaker 1: So a quote from the article.

161
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:50,600
Speaker 1: There's a guy who's works for the product Stewardship Institute Which is a nonprofit whose sole goal is to limit the environmental impact of consumer products.

162
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:55,020
Speaker 1: All right, he basically said we all know if you were in fever people to use the phone book every year.

163
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,090
Speaker 1: It's an antiquated antiquated industry.

164
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:57,714
Speaker 1: We should get rid of it.

165
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:13,791
Speaker 1: and Basically some laws were passed in Seattle Yeah Seattle saying that people should be allowed to opt out of the delivery of any phone book yellow or white Simple law that people should have the right to opt out.

166
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:14,575
Speaker 1: Yep.

167
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:15,880
Speaker 1: A similar law was passed.

168
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,548
Speaker 0: What's the penalty for giving someone a phone book who opted out?

169
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,150
Speaker 1: I don't know.

170
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:20,153
Speaker 0: Is there penalty?

171
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:20,735
Speaker 1: Yes.

172
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,139
Speaker 1: I'm as I assume so, okay.

173
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:30,138
Speaker 1: So San Francisco passed a similar law and The phone book companies the private company lost their tribute.

174
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:38,500
Speaker 1: them Filed lawsuits against these laws saying there's a violation of free speech to allow people to opt out of receiving their phone books.

175
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:42,626
Speaker 1: Okay So think about this.

176
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:46,400
Speaker 1: how whenever has an industry in one stroke?

177
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Speaker 1: Both fought against its demise and proved why it needs to go away in a single sentence.

178
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:56,366
Speaker 0: But I mean, okay, so if you say it's free speech Let's say they win.

179
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,860
Speaker 0: It's free speech - for the phone book, right?

180
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,918
Speaker 0: You can't opt out of it.

181
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:05,160
Speaker 0: That means I can drop anything on everyone's porch no matter what even if they have a sign.

182
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,273
Speaker 0: This is no soliciting or don't leave your menus here it.

183
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,782
Speaker 0: that means it's legal for me to drop anything I want.

184
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:15,537
Speaker 0: that is speech on anyone's doorstep and they're not allowed to say no forget that.

185
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,460
Speaker 1: let's go a little closer.

186
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,887
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go and make something some sort of art.

187
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,756
Speaker 0: It's an artistic piece of dog poop, right?

188
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:21,936
Speaker 0: It's.

189
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,120
Speaker 0: it's a dog poop sculpture.

190
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,525
Speaker 0: It's it's speech.

191
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 0: It's art and I'm gonna leave it on everyone's doorstep because that's part of the artistic message.

192
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,674
Speaker 1: Simpler argument.

193
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:39,919
Speaker 1: All right They're saying that they want the right to deliver phone books to people who don't want them so badly That they will file paperwork to make sure they don't get them.

194
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:44,499
Speaker 1: Now clearly the people who get them who don't want them are not going to open them.

195
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:52,660
Speaker 1: So this industry is Proving that all it is doing is using its fake circulation numbers to trick people who don't know better to buying ads.

196
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,479
Speaker 0: It's all advertising is the same way.

197
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,460
Speaker 1: So that's pretty much it.

198
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:06,380
Speaker 1: I just thought it was interesting And I thought that the fact that the phone book companies are suing for the right to foist their garbage upon people is kind of amazing.

199
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:09,728
Speaker 0: Nothing surprised me anymore.

200
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,477
Speaker 0: I've been seeing the same thing for 15 years.

201
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:24,158
Speaker 1: Remember every year they would bring the phone books on a big pallet and put him in Gracie's and anyone who wanted a phone book would just take him and Pretty much no one took him and they all went into the dumpster.

202
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:28,435
Speaker 0: I mean, this is yet another one of those things where it's like it took this long.

203
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:29,640
Speaker 0: It's like I could have you know.

204
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:36,703
Speaker 0: So behind the times this should have been done in like 1997 not 2012 Mm-hmm.

205
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,288
Speaker 0: The thing is the.

206
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,322
Speaker 1: there's a quote from the article to from the industry itself saying that they believe they don't Believe.

207
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:47,989
Speaker 1: they say that seventy five percent of people Actively use the yellow pages and I call bullshit on that.

208
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:48,972
Speaker 0: That's absolutely bullshit.

209
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,680
Speaker 1: There's no way I have not used a yellow page.

210
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,100
Speaker 0: Okay, someone who buys in yellow pages ad should sue them for false advertise.

211
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,053
Speaker 1: I can't imagine the last time I used a yellow pages for anything.

212
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:01,000
Speaker 0: I think I used it in Beacon once.

213
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

214
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:04,547
Speaker 1: I looked up.

215
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:05,630
Speaker 1: I was looking for what.

216
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,535
Speaker 1: was it a plumber or something?

217
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:17,999
Speaker 1: So once in ten years Plus I Decided a long time ago and I've stuck to this Unless I walk past a place or I specifically know about it due to some other means.

218
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:22,756
Speaker 1: Pretty much no one who doesn't have a website is ever gonna get business for me ever.

219
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:23,519
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

220
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:29,891
Speaker 0: So yeah, the biggest news of today Was YouTube adding creative common support right now.

221
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,898
Speaker 0: This is you know, it's like well, what's the big deal?

222
00:12:31,938 --> 00:13:01,460
Speaker 0: Well Flickr has always had creative common support and the way flickers stuff worked was that you could go and mark your photos With a creative commons license any creative commons license you desired and then it would clearly display on your photo What license it had and would also put the appropriate metadata in the HTML so someone could programmatically Determine, you know, which flicker photos were licensed with which you know restrictions and whatnot in which terms which you know.

223
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,932
Speaker 0: YouTube has now added that and I'm like good god.

224
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:08,310
Speaker 0: It's like you flicker had that Decade ago, why isn't YouTube had that?

225
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:09,858
Speaker 0: but they finally have it.

226
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,270
Speaker 0: but What they've added is pretty much just one license.

227
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,474
Speaker 0: It's the same license.

228
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,039
Speaker 0: We have attribution only which is great.

229
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:19,216
Speaker 0: Because I really don't you know, there's a reason I picked that one.

230
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:34,767
Speaker 0: Yeah And would also be kind of difficult for them to add the no commercial license because then YouTube couldn't put an ad on your video And it would be a little difficult for them to do, you know, the share alike license, you know, because it's like well Would

231
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:37,059
Speaker 1: be really easy for them to do it because there's nothing for them to do.

232
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,740
Speaker 0: Well the point I think that other thing is that they wanted to keep it simple for the user.

233
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, they why it's just creative commons or not?

234
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:45,293
Speaker 0: right?

235
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:47,200
Speaker 0: not pick a license, duh?

236
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,932
Speaker 1: Well, I also like think about this the subtle it.

237
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:57,483
Speaker 1: by using this as the intelligent default It just people who don't know better will end up giving up more rights They would have.

238
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,080
Speaker 0: they'll use the most permissive best license the one that everyone should use for almost everything.

239
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:02,286
Speaker 0: Anyway.

240
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:07,737
Speaker 0: But so that's you know, they added basically the same thing that flicker has kinda.

241
00:14:07,757 --> 00:14:09,705
Speaker 0: so it's like, okay Well, what's so exciting about that?

242
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:11,713
Speaker 0: What's exciting is the other feature they have added.

243
00:14:12,777 --> 00:14:19,186
Speaker 0: if you don't know this There's actually a sort of mediocre video editor built into YouTube right like.

244
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:28,980
Speaker 0: you can edit videos right in your web browser and This video editor now searches through YouTube for all the creative commons license videos Right and allows you to edit them together.

245
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:35,574
Speaker 0: And if you're looking if you're watching a video that is creative commons license You can click a button to start editing it right away right in the browser.

246
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,040
Speaker 1: So, you know, what's gonna happen here?

247
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,652
Speaker 1: See, yes, I think you know what's gonna happen here a creative explosion.

248
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:49,344
Speaker 0: I know what flicker really needs to do right is They need to make it so that when you click on a photo that's creative commons license as an in-browser Photoshop.

249
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,671
Speaker 0: kind of situation going on.

250
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,420
Speaker 0: That would be pretty awesome.

251
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,220
Speaker 1: Well, something's got to happen because I'm not paying for any more Adobe Premiere after the version I've got now.

252
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it it amazes me that premiere to this day cannot deal with a vast majority of formats of video out there.

253
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:06,844
Speaker 0: I know right.

254
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:14,799
Speaker 0: It's like it was funny because today we got an intern at work And he had an Ubuntu machine and he was like the video player was like install a codec.

255
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:16,378
Speaker 0: Yes No, and I was like, oh, that's right.

256
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:23,374
Speaker 0: like Ubuntu the open source stuff just Automatically gets any codec in the universe for every kind of video and plays it all perfectly.

257
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,840
Speaker 0: and it's only on Windows and Mac That you need to go get some other video.

258
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,250
Speaker 1: Also weird codec packs are the worst Adobe that you know.

259
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,514
Speaker 1: people always excuse them.

260
00:15:32,554 --> 00:15:38,640
Speaker 1: Adobe themselves usually say things like oh well It's for professionals not amateurs and professionals only use X format and Y form.

261
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,603
Speaker 0: It's like the commercial software is the one that's missing all the codecs and all the features in the open source software as every codec In the universe.

262
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:53,760
Speaker 1: the other argument they'll make is that oh well format X or container Y is not suited to Frame by frame editing to which my answer is so why don't you just have it important convert?

263
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:57,440
Speaker 0: Because that would be more work for them and it wouldn't sell them any more copies.

264
00:15:57,763 --> 00:15:59,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you always say.

265
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:00,164
Speaker 0: They would.

266
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:02,132
Speaker 0: they sell it if they added MKV support.

267
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:03,880
Speaker 0: how many more copies of premiere would that sell them?

268
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,019
Speaker 1: I know I know that's why I have premiere now because it's still better than any open source thing there is.

269
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:15,500
Speaker 1: But that's not gonna be the case forever and I just got a hold out on this shit ass version of premiere.

270
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:27,738
Speaker 0: Until the open source world is good enough for me to edit together videos of Rainbow Dash What happens right is they wouldn't sell any more copies or premiere But someone else has a business selling a premiere plug-in that makes MKV's work.

271
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,528
Speaker 1: Oh good So we were sorry.

272
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,500
Speaker 0: premiere added that feature.

273
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:35,380
Speaker 0: All they would do is put that other company out of business, but they wouldn't make any more money for themselves.

274
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,719
Speaker 1: You know what really grinds my gears.

275
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,100
Speaker 1: Yeah that but let's zoom out because a better example that people are more familiar with is Twitter.

276
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,176
Speaker 1: Twitter has a thing people might use it.

277
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:46,840
Speaker 1: It's called Twitter.

278
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:51,900
Speaker 1: You can tweet and there's an API that lets you do cool stuff that Twitter doesn't do by default.

279
00:16:52,505 --> 00:17:07,560
Speaker 1: So a lot of people built whole Businesses around providing little features that Twitter didn't provide and then Twitter then provides those features and those people are now mad Claiming that Twitter is unfairly competing with them or driving them out of business or somehow tricked them.

280
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,507
Speaker 0: This isn't really your.

281
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:12,640
Speaker 1: their dumb ass is for even thinking that that was a viable business model.

282
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is an old old story in the software world, right?

283
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,451
Speaker 0: I mean, I think the best example is Visual Studio.

284
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:21,907
Speaker 0: right Visual Studio as many versions I mean.

285
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:28,280
Speaker 0: when I was in high school We were using Visual Studio like five and now they're on Visual Studio 2011 or 2010 or who knows what right?

286
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 1: I installed the newest free version on my computer at work and I really like it anyway.

287
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:36,580
Speaker 0: But the point is is that Visual Studio has lots of plugins for all sorts of shit, right?

288
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:56,846
Speaker 0: Cuz it has to integrate with all sorts of different development things, you know, if you're developing some particular thing Well, you know instead of say, you know Writing your own development environment You just make a Visual Studio plug-in so that people can then use Visual Studio to develop software for whatever your weird platform is right and there's tons and tons of plugins out there.

289
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:08,139
Speaker 0: and this whole business is that survived by making Visual Studio plugins and doing things that Visual Studio doesn't do and Occasionally as you can imagine over many many years 10 plus years of Visual Studio, maybe even 15 years.

290
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:08,917
Speaker 0: I don't know It's really old.

291
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:19,106
Speaker 0: they've added a lot of features to Visual Studio that have made a lot of those plugins useless and made basically a lot of those companies that make those plugins Not need to exist anymore.

292
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:20,230
Speaker 0: And it's just a reality.

293
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,459
Speaker 1: This is what happens and nothing of value was lost.

294
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,028
Speaker 0: Yeah This is what happens when you build a business Based on someone else's business.

295
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,360
Speaker 0: that business that is underneath you can owns you right?

296
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:43,240
Speaker 0: It's like if I made an accessory for Ford cars and then Ford change the design of their cars so that my accessory doesn't work Anymore or they provide that feature in the car already so that my accessory is no longer necessary.

297
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,240
Speaker 0: Well, I basically my business depended on Ford.

298
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:54,000
Speaker 0: So am I pretty much my hopes are Ford buys me and I become part of Ford and or they ignore me.

299
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:58,655
Speaker 0: You know, I'm basically putting a whole bunch of risk because this other company.

300
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,442
Speaker 0: I'm dependent on them You.

301
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:04,700
Speaker 0: if you want to have a long-term business, you need to be dependent on nobody but yourself.

302
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:07,080
Speaker 1: Well and the general economy?

303
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, that's but that's true with any business.

304
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,020
Speaker 0: But you know, it's especially true in software where a lot of things are plugins.

305
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,160
Speaker 0: I mean even making something simple, right?

306
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,960
Speaker 0: Like if you make a video game and you use DirectX and you make you make a Windows video game, right?

307
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,702
Speaker 0: Using DirectX.

308
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:28,900
Speaker 0: Well, guess what Microsoft owns you if they decide to just discontinue DirectX or remove it from Windows or Who know?

309
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,895
Speaker 1: The same time they go?

310
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:31,540
Speaker 0: it's unlikely.

311
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,223
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's not a great example because that's more like using Like.

312
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:39,080
Speaker 1: that's a platform for developing and you understand the consequences of the platform these people.

313
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,680
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's obviously that is a low-risk a very low-risk situation, right?

314
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,485
Speaker 0: But the point is you are still.

315
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:48,359
Speaker 0: there is an extremely tiny but existing risk that you are dependent on.

316
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:52,492
Speaker 1: Microsoft Congress is gonna make your entire industry illegal.

317
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:57,808
Speaker 0: That's also always true Right, but the you know, you ought to reduce those risks.

318
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,495
Speaker 0: so don't build something that like.

319
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:04,780
Speaker 0: if you're making a website using You know, it's okay to integrate with Facebook, right?

320
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:12,664
Speaker 0: But you probably don't want Facebook connect being your only means of logging in because then Facebook can totally owns your company basically Indirectly.

321
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,351
Speaker 0: you need to also have your own logging in.

322
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,284
Speaker 0: in case Facebook connect dicks you over You can just drop them and your website will still work.

323
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:28,060
Speaker 1: So speaking of dicks is time for things of the day.

324
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:32,579
Speaker 1: So I was trying to think oh, wow, that's actually really relevant to your thing of the day.

325
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,800
Speaker 0: Intentionally, I was trying to think of a classic thing of the day, right?

326
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,242
Speaker 0: Cuz I couldn't.

327
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,878
Speaker 0: there have been any new things of the day that aren't College Humor.

328
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:40,260
Speaker 0: lately.

329
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,948
Speaker 1: We've got College Humor's down right now.

330
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,240
Speaker 0: Is it really because it worked for me a few minutes ago?

331
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:45,264
Speaker 1: Maybe it just came back out.

332
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:49,140
Speaker 1: We've got some old classics that we've already done like here born to be alive.

333
00:20:49,301 --> 00:21:02,399
Speaker 0: yeah, I tried to go and look up some classics and figure out if we hadn't done them like Kakugo Jui Chi or push a robot shovel robot secret of space or You know, have we done all your base or belong to us?

334
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:03,404
Speaker 0: Right?

335
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:05,380
Speaker 0: and it was like we've done all those things in the day, right?

336
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,847
Speaker 0: I couldn't find any things of the day.

337
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:13,296
Speaker 0: We haven't used except for one I think and I realized Oh, this is something that is sort of an inside joke and we always bring it up.

338
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,409
Speaker 0: It's horrible It's in the show.

339
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:16,760
Speaker 0: We bring it up all the time.

340
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,460
Speaker 0: This is one of those people probably don't know what the hell we're talking to.

341
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:31,080
Speaker 1: You've probably heard us on the show say It's a little bit more obscure than it's goofy time, right?

342
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,665
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, we say that the dragon does all the time But I don't think most.

343
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:39,360
Speaker 0: I think pretty sure most people have no idea what we're referring even in our crew.

344
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,550
Speaker 1: About half the crew either don't know what we're talking about.

345
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:48,950
Speaker 1: a few of them know vaguely what we're talking about in that They know it's a horrifying thing that they don't actually want to see.

346
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,551
Speaker 0: All right.

347
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,400
Speaker 0: Well if you are curious, here's the YouTube video.

348
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:55,332
Speaker 0: We're gonna reveal the inside joke my year.

349
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:59,457

353
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,732
Speaker 1: I just didn't finish it yet, but I'm mashing that up with spike in my little pony.

00:22:08,932 --> 00:22:09,273
Speaker 1: Nice.

355
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:10,537
Speaker 0: That's horrible.

356
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:11,420
Speaker 0: That's the greatest.

357
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,125
Speaker 1: There's one deeper.

358
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,268
Speaker 1: It's like goofy.

359
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:18,480
Speaker 1: time is like this level and then under that is the dragon the year.

360
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,098
Speaker 1: You know what's under that?

361
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,745
Speaker 0: Which the Basically there's.

362
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,739
Speaker 0: this is not a thing of the day because we can't actually find it.

363
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,980
Speaker 1: I don't think it's on the internet ride and to my credit trying to find that is a trying process.

364
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,860
Speaker 1: There was like the things you see in Google.

365
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:42,960
Speaker 0: There was a really really shitty flash animation that was poorly drawn in MS Paint by like a teenager.

366
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:45,220
Speaker 1: But it started out, you know back when flash animations.

367
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:51,612
Speaker 1: It was basically just the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme with some kind of mediocre from the year 2000 of they of it.

368
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:54,023
Speaker 1: and it starts out benign like okay This is lame.

369
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:57,840
Speaker 1: and then little penises like pop up like for a second.

370
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,084
Speaker 1: You're like was that a penis?

371
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:06,870
Speaker 1: and you're not sure and then it just goes full tilt from there like Michelangelo Is a party dude and we can't.

372
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,913
Speaker 0: there's a flash animation.

373
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,659
Speaker 0: That's this horrifying Ninja Turtles.

374
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,744
Speaker 1: hard It is the search for this.

380
00:23:22,107 --> 00:23:22,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, does it?

381
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,660
Speaker 0: so that's not a thing of the day because he can't find it.

382
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,540
Speaker 1: But if you find it, you'll get a free geek nights t-shirt.

383
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:31,114
Speaker 0: My year with the dragon is a thing of the day.

384
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,160
Speaker 0: and what's rims thing of the day?

385
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,962
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is Emily works with and knows a lot of talented people and she went to the NYU School of Film and Animation.

386
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:42,700
Speaker 1: so what I have for you and it's a link to our forum post that has three of them in a row.

387
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:50,700
Speaker 1: Three of her co-workers have three of their animation theses from SVA And they're pretty goddamn bad ass.

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,540
Speaker 0: If you don't know SVA is the School of Visual Arts in New York City and basically everyone who goes there is like the best Artist in the world school for visual awesome.

389
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:03,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much you go to like mocha festival and there's like just like a row of SVA students and it's like how do you?

390
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,327
Speaker 0: What are they teaching you at this school?

391
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,635
Speaker 0: I have no art skills.

392
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,088
Speaker 0: if I went to this school Would I suddenly be like Van Gogh?

393
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,836
Speaker 0: I don't know how this shit works.

394
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,425
Speaker 1: I have a feeling It's like RIT.

395
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:17,220
Speaker 1: if you don't already know how to code when you get to RIT You're not coming out knowing how to code.

396
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,086
Speaker 0: Yeah But SVA is some kind of magic.

397
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,853
Speaker 0: everyone who goes there is the best artist ever.

398
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:25,012
Speaker 1: Naomi George and Eugene Made three videos three animations.

399
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:25,676
Speaker 1: They're pretty great.

400
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:26,480
Speaker 1: I'm linking to them.

401
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:29,519
Speaker 0: How could they if they were you just tell me it doesn't matter who they are.

402
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,549
Speaker 0: So and so what school they go to SVA?

403
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:33,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to see whatever art they did because it's the best.

404
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:37,680
Speaker 0: So of course in the meta unless they failed out we're talking about people great.

405
00:24:38,282 --> 00:24:40,108
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're horrible artists who fail out.

406
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:42,296
Speaker 0: Maybe that's their trick is they just kill everyone.

407
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, who's bad?

408
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:45,507
Speaker 0: Just maintain the reputation.

409
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,360
Speaker 1: So the book club book is still Isaac Asimov's foundation.

410
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,811
Speaker 1: We'll do the show on it at some point.

411
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:58,880
Speaker 1: the unofficial book Book is the entirety of the Prince of Nothing series by our Scott backer because we're gonna do more shows on it.

412
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, that deserves a set of dedicated shows that we could almost make.

413
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:03,520
Speaker 1: that will be pod.

414
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,426
Speaker 0: We'll be doing shows on it for years.

415
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a perennial favorite.

416
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:09,499
Speaker 1: I don't know what else.

417
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,380
Speaker 0: I should say It's like it's the front row crew book, right?

418
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:18,251
Speaker 0: It's not that it's not the best fantasy book ever but it's great and it's it, you know, it has special meaning for listeners

419
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:26,200
Speaker 1: are proving my expectations right because about every month or so Someone will post in the forum or email us and be like, I finally read that fucking our Scott backer book.

420
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,124
Speaker 1: Why'd I wait this long?

421
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:27,928
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ?

422
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:28,309
Speaker 0: Yeah.

423
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,836
Speaker 1: Oh man when ne'er died.

424
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:39,520
Speaker 0: Yeah Everyone's favorite scene lately is is With it with the Emperor being like yeah your guards are outside mine.

425
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,559
Speaker 1: Oh, that is one of my favorite scenes, too.

426
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,038
Speaker 1: That was an any kiss the Emperor's ring when I read that scene when I first read the book That was the moment when I stopped and went.

427
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,725
Speaker 0: Hells yeah, cuz like they play.

428
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:55,300
Speaker 0: play the Emperor like he's a crazy, you know, almost like, you know nutty inbred Roman guy.

429
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:59,440
Speaker 0: But then it's like oh, there's a reason he's still the Emperor and not dead already.

430
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:04,346
Speaker 0: He's more like with this.

431
00:26:04,447 --> 00:26:05,773
Speaker 0: he's more like a Stalin.

432
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:07,300
Speaker 1: only should I stack.

433
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,300
Speaker 0: It's more like a Stalin in the paranoia sense and not in the killing everybody's or in the chest.

434
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:15,108
Speaker 1: I don't think I could behead him the ceremonial sword.

435
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:15,931
Speaker 1: Isn't that sharp?

436
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:20,146
Speaker 1: Oh Man that's some good stuff.

437
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:22,420
Speaker 1: We're gonna be at PAX not prices conference.

438
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,300
Speaker 1: Probably a PAX dev Connecticut will be at not at Otacon, but that's their call not ours.

439
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,263
Speaker 0: Anyway That's enough.

440
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:33,512
Speaker 0: Oh, let's talk about e-commerce right ram.

441
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:35,300
Speaker 0: Have you sent t-shirts to everyone who's supposed to get them?

442
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,827
Speaker 1: They're going out actually this week.

443
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:37,631
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

444
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:38,535
Speaker 0: You're a little slow there.

445
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,319
Speaker 1: I am a little slow.

446
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,268
Speaker 0: Did you get the international shipping work?

447
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,880
Speaker 1: Oh, I have two people who request international orders.

448
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:54,540
Speaker 1: I tested with one of them to see if it would work and it looks like it'll work Alright, so all the people all the people have already posted in the forum or emailed me about international orders.

449
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:59,420
Speaker 1: Those should go out by Saturday and you'll get an invoice from Google checkout.

450
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,340
Speaker 0: So if somebody can it so can somebody just go to the shop front recruit calm and buy something internationally.

451
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,608
Speaker 1: Well, you want an international shipping of a t-shirt.

452
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:08,551
Speaker 1: You have to email me.

00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,618
Speaker 0: rim at front recruit calm.

454
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:14,873
Speaker 0: Yep I'll maybe I'll make shop at front recruit calm and make it point to you.

455
00:27:15,073 --> 00:27:16,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, we might have already done something like that.

456
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,851
Speaker 1: I forget what we did with the shot.

457
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:18,618
Speaker 1: I got a look in the head.

458
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:26,560
Speaker 1: Anyway, so anyone who has a t-shirt order pending if you don't receive it with within about a week of today then something went wrong.

459
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then as soon as the merch runs out, we're gonna have about three of them left.

460
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:32,842
Speaker 1: after I ship the outstanding order We'll get.

461
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:33,746
Speaker 0: we'll get new merch.

462
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:34,489
Speaker 1: We got some.

463
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:35,875
Speaker 0: we'll make it a higher priority.

464
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,120
Speaker 1: Maybe we should make it dragon.

465
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,924
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

466
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:41,660
Speaker 0: Maybe we could do it in time for not kinetic on but packs West.

467
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:46,296
Speaker 1: Ah, actually what I want to do for the next packs East is make geek nights trading cards.

468
00:27:46,537 --> 00:27:47,039
Speaker 0: We could do that.

469
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,434
Speaker 0: Good getting with all the other trading card people.

470
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:51,625
Speaker 1: Yeah our buttons I don't know both.

471
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:56,566
Speaker 1: we can make some buttons for prime we but we always say we'll do that and someone else did it for Us and then it's a month before the car.

472
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:57,391
Speaker 0: some awesome people.

473
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,898
Speaker 1: I know cuz we're not awesome enough.

474
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:03,579
Speaker 1: every year I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna make buttons and then it's a week before packs and I'm like, oh right buttons.

475
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, that's enough meta.

476
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:06,812
Speaker 0: That's enough.

477
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:16,884
Speaker 0: So game shows Alright, so this status feels like a show we've done before but I extensively searched the archives for a show about TV game shows And I did not find one.

478
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:18,631
Speaker 0: if this is a repeat.

479
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:19,515
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

480
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:20,880
Speaker 0: Call me out and you are right.

481
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:23,252
Speaker 1: No, because they people have been requesting repeats.

482
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:24,860
Speaker 1: We've been planning to do this for a while.

483
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,603
Speaker 1: We just haven't bought.

484
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:28,535
Speaker 0: but the thing doesn't matter cuz I'm pretty sure it's not a repeat like 99% sure cuz.

485
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:30,441
Speaker 0: I searched Extensively.

486
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,324
Speaker 1: but one last meta.

487
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:39,490
Speaker 1: something we were planning to do at some point is go take a particular random old episode of geek nights From like - nothing you were planning to do not me.

488
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,317
Speaker 1: the listeners want it and I want it.

489
00:28:41,358 --> 00:28:41,900
Speaker 1: I think it'd be cool.

490
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:43,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, you always want this weird to take a top.

491
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:54,639
Speaker 1: take a show we did in like 2005 2006 right take the exact same topic Record it again and then you know, listen to the old show and see if our opinions have changed.

492
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:55,604
Speaker 0: Probably.

493
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,393
Speaker 0: yeah find any show.

494
00:28:57,413 --> 00:28:57,694
Speaker 0: We're like.

495
00:28:57,714 --> 00:29:02,262
Speaker 0: PC gaming is dead Nintendo.

496
00:29:02,563 --> 00:29:03,125
Speaker 1: I disagree.

497
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:05,793
Speaker 1: we weren't wrong then because then PC gaming was dead.

498
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,080
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it is having a renaissance.

499
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:10,660
Speaker 1: I'm just saying which we did not say could not happen.

500
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,380
Speaker 1: I'm just saying but I digress now.

501
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:17,660
Speaker 1: We argued at length before recording this whether or not this was a Tuesday or a Thursday show.

502
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,591
Speaker 1: The reasons why we were doing it on Thursday are one.

503
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,318
Speaker 1: We needed a Thursday show.

504
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:23,763
Speaker 0: That's right Number.

505
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:24,806
Speaker 0: that's the number one reason.

506
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:25,388
Speaker 1: I have some.

507
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:26,732
Speaker 1: that's the number one answer.

508
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:29,160
Speaker 1: I have some post-hoc reasons.

509
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:42,767
Speaker 1: If we were going to do a show on game shows, that was a Tuesday We'd talk more about the mechanics of the shows and the strategy and individual shows in great mechanical detail Mm-hmm, but we're not talking about that.

510
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:46,660
Speaker 1: We're talking about them as television shows as entertainment as us at home watching.

511
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:47,445
Speaker 0: That's a post-hoc.

512
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:48,310
Speaker 0: Excuse the real it's.

513
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,920
Speaker 0: the real reason is we need Thursday shows.

514
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,529
Speaker 1: I did not say it was not a post-hoc excuse.

515
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,576
Speaker 1: In fact, I already had that disclaimer there.

516
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:58,389
Speaker 1: I'm just saying me I'm the king of post-hoc trash talk.

517
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,092
Speaker 0: That is right.

518
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:05,694
Speaker 0: So you're you're in fact not the king of No, you're the god of post-hoc trash talk.

519
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:06,055
Speaker 0: you go down.

520
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:07,340
Speaker 0: it's like Thor lightning.

521
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,866
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm rim.

522
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:11,119
Speaker 0: post-hoc trash talk.

523
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,445
Speaker 0: Scott giant penises.

524
00:30:13,526 --> 00:30:13,747
Speaker 1: Okay.

525
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:16,960
Speaker 1: It's very rare that I will say I'm gonna win this game before the game.

526
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:22,246
Speaker 1: I rarely will pull the Babe Ruth and point out over the outfield After the game's over.

527
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:22,708
Speaker 1: I'll be like.

528
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,156
Speaker 1: I knew I was gonna win the whole time.

529
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:24,980
Speaker 0: That's right.

530
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:27,375
Speaker 0: Anyway, so so TV game shows.

531
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:28,180
Speaker 0: it's weird.

532
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:31,086
Speaker 0: We were when we were preparing for this show Which we spent about five minutes on.

533
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:38,535
Speaker 1: we went to Wikipedia and found a list of TV game shows And I right-clicked on every one that I watched and I clicked on like 30 game show.

534
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:39,779
Speaker 0: I couldn't figure out it's like.

535
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:44,216
Speaker 0: I didn't Realize it until now just like how much I liked TV game shows.

536
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:46,545
Speaker 0: when I watch TV It's like I didn't like.

537
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:53,689
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that was actually sort of a moderate to major Geekery of mine because I didn't even it was just.

538
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,234
Speaker 0: it's just sort of like always there.

539
00:30:55,294 --> 00:31:00,133
Speaker 0: the same way that like when I was A kid Disney afternoon was like always there and I wasn't like.

540
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:06,871
Speaker 0: you asked me if I was a big fan of it I would have been like no, it's just the thing I Every goddamn day it was on.

541
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:08,140
Speaker 0: yeah, so it's like game shows.

542
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,260
Speaker 0: I realized just now just within the past hour that they're one of those things that I just sort of always watched.

543
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:15,500
Speaker 0: Never felt like I was a big fan.

544
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:22,260
Speaker 0: I've never you know Expressed never wore t-shirts about them or bought merch for them or anything like that to be on them desperately.

545
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:24,893
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, of course cuz I knew if I was on the Price is Right.

546
00:31:24,913 --> 00:31:26,240
Speaker 0: I was gonna kill I was gonna win everything.

547
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,706
Speaker 1: Oh my god Legend of the Hidden Temple.

548
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:37,520
Speaker 0: I know I'd win all that when that to watch that guard out Nick arcade Win that shit, but when Nick arcade Nick and broken anyway, it's true, but I would have done better than those punk kids.

549
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:42,812
Speaker 0: But it's like I didn't realize that I was actually such a big fan of them.

550
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:46,084
Speaker 0: and there's like so many that I liked and watched Frequently.

551
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:59,043
Speaker 0: and it's actually kind of sad because even though I don't watch TV now I realize just from what I know, you know I guess from being one or two spaces away from TV that most there aren't really that many game shows Left.

552
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:01,639
Speaker 0: a lot of them are changed and aren't what they want to work.

553
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:08,760
Speaker 0: Well to think this one to a lot of reality shows now are actually game shows that they just call reality show.

554
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,200
Speaker 1: Well, that's what I noticed when I was looking through the list.

555
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:16,254
Speaker 1: It's that there was like this Boom of game shows in the 60s and another boom in the 80s.

556
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:24,970
Speaker 1: and then in the 90s There was like this weird like side boom where all the game shows got very slick but also very gimmicky and less gamey.

557
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:29,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was we and like I remember this whole era of that like remember who wants to be a millionaire?

558
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:35,577
Speaker 1: Like these very high production value game shows that were actually less Entertaining to me as game shows.

559
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:39,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the like, you know, there are the things that were still game shows, right?

560
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,799
Speaker 0: Like let's make not let's meet it.

561
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,410
Speaker 1: Let's make a deal is like my face.

562
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,538
Speaker 0: What's the one with the suitcases?

563
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:49,710
Speaker 0: Oh dealer no deal and I knew I had the workshop I knew I had the word deal in it, but now I learned about that show.

564
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,230
Speaker 1: This is how disconnected I am from from television reality now, you know back because it's an arcade machine.

565
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:59,029
Speaker 0: No, I knew about pen radio How he was on pen radio.

566
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, he talked about how he hated the game and was tricked into being on it as the host and then he liked it.

567
00:33:04,308 --> 00:33:11,739
Speaker 1: Yep but anyway Look at that game show Dealer no deal and it's like.

568
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:21,612
Speaker 1: alright the optimal strategy Basically involves ignoring what anyone says and choosing randomly and then stopping when you've either won enough money or have a possibility of winning enough Money.

569
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:34,670
Speaker 0: Yep, that there was a guy in a Forum that I frequent right who was on a more recent episode of who wants to be a millionaire And he just went on and answered questions and he made it to like 60k or something like that.

570
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:35,499
Speaker 0: And he's just like, you know what?

571
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:35,903
Speaker 0: I'm stopping.

572
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:36,409
Speaker 1: I would do that.

573
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:38,378
Speaker 0: I was like I was like hell.

574
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:39,844
Speaker 0: I went in the forum and I was like cuz.

575
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:45,184
Speaker 0: he posted a YouTube bit of his appearance And I was like dude, you're the awesomest you did the smartest thing ever.

576
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:45,505
Speaker 0: Yep.

577
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:46,890
Speaker 1: Don't go over the million dollars.

578
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:49,246
Speaker 0: What kind of moron are you?

579
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:54,730
Speaker 0: it's like 60,000 for 15 minutes work and there's a risk if you keep going that you're gonna lose it all.

580
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,800
Speaker 0: How would you possibly not stop and take the money home?

581
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:00,950
Speaker 1: So that's game theory and mechanism design.

582
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:05,590
Speaker 0: Okay, the psychology the mechanisms, but they also have psychology of the sets.

583
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:12,856
Speaker 0: It's like a casino right where the the the audio video lighting of the of the place Yeah makes you do.

584
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:16,989
Speaker 0: they're trying to trick you into doing certain behaviors and the guy totally didn't fall for it.

585
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:22,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, so what I think the my favoritest game show of all time?

586
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,190
Speaker 1: Oh the one that we have to break this up because there's favoritest and there's also most watched.

587
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:27,833
Speaker 0: Well, I think they're both the same.

588
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:28,436
Speaker 1: price is right.

589
00:34:28,496 --> 00:34:29,098
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

590
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:37,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, whenever I was home from school at 11 o'clock I'd watch the price is right and watch lunch if I was home for school from school for any reason.

591
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,016
Speaker 1: Reruns of the price is right.

592
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:40,639
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

593
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,902
Speaker 1: It's not like you can remember the episode Yeah, and I remember thinking as a kid that I was really good at it.

594
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:47,830
Speaker 1: And I think nowadays I would be terrible at it.

595
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:55,435
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is is that a lot of the products that you to know the price of right are probably they wonder the manufacturers suggested retail price.

596
00:34:55,475 --> 00:35:03,830
Speaker 1: as a kid for some reason I always knew when I finally figured out why a Lot of the stuff which things were things you've seen grocery stores and in malls.

597
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:09,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I spent a lot of time as a kid in grocery stores following my parents around buying stuff.

598
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:23,350
Speaker 1: But the point is that because you never pay manufacturer suggested retail price but MSRP was usually listed on the labels of things and because I was a bored kid who Couldn't walk and play my game gear at the same time because the battery only lasted like 10 minutes.

599
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:29,270
Speaker 1: Anyway, I was reading everything that I could read because I just I needed something.

600
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:36,152
Speaker 0: My the reason I knew the prices is because I watch the prices right a lot and I didn't actually know prices of things in Stores.

601
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:46,047
Speaker 0: and then when I you know now I sort of know the prices because I buy things I credit the price is right with a very important like first step toward game theory mastery.

602
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,395
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid I learned how to be.

603
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:49,439
Speaker 0: you knew when to bid $1.

604
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:58,100
Speaker 1: because one day when I was watching the show one day and someone bid a Dollar and I was like what and then it dawned on me Yeah, and then I learned a lot from watching that show.

605
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,110
Speaker 1: and I remember one day a guy bid $1.

606
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 1: He was the second to last person.

607
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,546
Speaker 0: the second guy bid the last guy bid $2.

608
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:11,869
Speaker 1: Yep And the first guy like the guy who bid $1 didn't seem to understand what his mistake was.

609
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,270
Speaker 0: Come on old ladies wouldn't even make that mistake and old ladies can spin the wheel.

610
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:18,316
Speaker 1: Yeah You know usually makes the worst mistakes.

611
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:23,770
Speaker 1: were the the people who are in there like 30s 40s who are these super Excitable like Bob Barker's there and they're just like.

612
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:25,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, they fuck up all the time.

613
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:29,262
Speaker 0: but the other thing about that show right is the thing I actually like the most.

614
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:33,018
Speaker 0: for all the weird games like Plinko or Punching the holes to grab the money.

615
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:34,444
Speaker 1: I always like the mountain climber.

616
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,710
Speaker 1: We got a mountain climber.

617
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:39,725
Speaker 1: Ah, I like this because a surprising number of people were so stupid.

618
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,849
Speaker 1: They let him fall off the top.

619
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:42,161
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I don't understand that.

620
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:45,137
Speaker 0: at least if you're gonna Go to the top stop.

621
00:36:45,197 --> 00:36:45,759
Speaker 0: I'm at the very.

622
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,407
Speaker 0: it was a tiny tiny chance.

623
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:47,990
Speaker 0: You could be right.

624
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,140
Speaker 1: I guess I like the show because it was a real like.

625
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,253
Speaker 1: it was a test of knowledge and skill Mostly skill.

626
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:54,257
Speaker 1: it wasn't that random.

627
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:54,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was.

628
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,130
Speaker 0: you know, I mean the mini golf game right you the putt.

629
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,837
Speaker 0: You actually just had the fucking putt.

630
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,609
Speaker 1: I love how he would always putt and he'd always get it in.

631
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,628
Speaker 0: I of course, you know, he practiced it.

632
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:05,838
Speaker 0: But you know, he's avid golfer.

633
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:06,843
Speaker 1: Did you see happy Gilmore?

634
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:08,090
Speaker 0: Yeah prices, right was the shit?

635
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:08,552
Speaker 0: I don't know.

636
00:37:08,613 --> 00:37:11,267
Speaker 0: I think as I nowadays I don't know if it's the shit anymore.

637
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:11,749
Speaker 0: I don't know.

638
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:12,797
Speaker 0: I mean we.

639
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,234
Speaker 0: I remember I had a thing of the day once Whatever.

640
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:17,966
Speaker 1: It's just Bob Barker was so perfect in that role.

641
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:18,850
Speaker 0: He's the best guy.

642
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,440
Speaker 0: Little microphone No one no one can touch.

643
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,010
Speaker 0: the original price is right.

644
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,823
Speaker 0: It's just like the untouchable best game show there ever was.

645
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:29,290
Speaker 1: it was also funny.

646
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,439
Speaker 1: It had this good mix of just everything going for it.

647
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:31,820
Speaker 0: Yep.

648
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,230
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it didn't even matter, you know.

649
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,790
Speaker 0: It wasn't like a competition between people like jeopardy where there's winners and losers after in the showcase showdown.

650
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then you're in the showcase.

651
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:41,967
Speaker 0: that means you won something.

652
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,500
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, there's there's a split in game shows to between.

653
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,149
Speaker 1: there's some game shows especially older game shows.

654
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:48,370
Speaker 1: where?

655
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,980
Speaker 1: Winner takes a whole bunch of stuff home and the loser gets buckets.

656
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:55,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now I'll like dealer no deal.

657
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,700
Speaker 1: There are shows where the odds are.

658
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,207
Speaker 1: if you get on the show in the first place.

659
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:02,302
Speaker 1: You've already won You're already gonna get a whole pile of money.

660
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,850
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of how much money you get.

661
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:04,959
Speaker 0: I mean even shows.

662
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,290
Speaker 0: if you ever watch like double dare, right?

663
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,517
Speaker 0: You'd always you didn't pay.

664
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,830
Speaker 0: really pay so much attention to this, but I do remember it.

665
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:15,714
Speaker 0: It's like you'd watch and one family be eliminated and be like and then there would be like this announcement Totally ignore.

666
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:22,196
Speaker 0: their parting gift is a bunch of bicycles or their parting gift is a bunch of video games Because those were all ads.

667
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:27,249
Speaker 0: those are all ads paid for by the people giving out the prizes obviously But you know, it's like you didn't pay attention to it.

668
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:35,039
Speaker 0: But there were parting gifts for pretty much everyone who lost at every stage of the way same thing on legends of hidden temple Every part every kid that was eliminated.

669
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,877
Speaker 0: the more stages you went in the prizes got better Better and better.

670
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:45,887
Speaker 0: So it's like if you had eliminated immediately in the water crossing part You got like some video tapes and if you got to the next part you maybe got a bicycle.

671
00:38:45,928 --> 00:38:48,001
Speaker 0: and if you won Then you won like a trip.

672
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:49,230
Speaker 1: so they don't just like take you out back.

673
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, you won like a trip.

674
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:53,889
Speaker 0: you wouldn't like a trip, you know back to Florida again or something like that.

675
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,590
Speaker 1: You know, I think you know I price is right.

676
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,202
Speaker 1: I watched the most and I got the most total enjoyment out of it.

677
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:03,518
Speaker 1: just cuz I watched so much of it But really I enjoyed.

678
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,945
Speaker 1: let's make a deal a lot more really you think?

679
00:39:05,965 --> 00:39:07,730
Speaker 0: so cuz I actually didn't watch that all that much.

680
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,630
Speaker 0: I've only watched it maybe like less less than 30 times the host and the psychology of it.

681
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,302
Speaker 1: Monty Hall was just a genius and it was.

682
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:15,430
Speaker 0: he was indeed a genius.

683
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:18,290
Speaker 1: There's something about that like, you know, there's different eras of comedy.

684
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,758
Speaker 1: There's a certain level of this kind of.

685
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:28,981
Speaker 1: I'm a game show host from the 70s 80s or early 90s Especially like early 80s mid 80s and late 70s.

686
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:31,790
Speaker 1: that just is different from other kinds of game show hosts.

687
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:35,464
Speaker 1: The only part of it is a certain amount of snark and a certain amount of like.

688
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:38,229
Speaker 1: we know we're taking the piss But we're doing this anyway.

689
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:46,470
Speaker 0: the only part of the show though that really stands out for me is like the great part was when he would go into the Audience and be like I'll treat you who's got like a coffee cup.

690
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:52,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know and people would start bringing weird shit just in case he would say that, you know Anyway, I got a handkerchief.

691
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,695
Speaker 0: you got a handkerchief.

692
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:58,150
Speaker 0: All right you I will trade you such-and-such for the handkerchief.

693
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,002
Speaker 1: So Scott, do you remember the mathematical solution to the Monty Hall of question?

694
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:04,290
Speaker 1: No, do you remember the Monty Hall problem?

695
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:09,835
Speaker 1: No, what do you always do is give you a choice of three doors, I know the three doors Yeah, so you pick one, right?

696
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:16,329
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you could either know and then he'd reveal one of them Mm-hmm, and then he'd be like you want to switch?

697
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's an absolute answer whether or not you should switch.

698
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,810
Speaker 0: Well, it depends what he revealed.

699
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,056
Speaker 0: What if you revealed like the best thing ever?

700
00:40:24,778 --> 00:40:25,440
Speaker 0: Of course, I'll take it.

701
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:35,149
Speaker 1: No, if you reveal all that anyway So well you should look up the Wikipedia not you but you the audience of geek nights the Monty Hall problem.

702
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:37,570
Speaker 1: because Don't like spoil it for yourself.

703
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:39,308
Speaker 1: Just read on the internet what the question is.

704
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:45,476
Speaker 1: See if you can work out the answer for yourself and then read the answer because you know what all those game theory books I Bought that's all they do.

705
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:46,541
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

706
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:48,168
Speaker 1: solve it then they're like, here's the answer.

707
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,072
Speaker 1: Here's the man Isn't it?

708
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,400
Speaker 0: You should always switch no matter what.

709
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:55,301
Speaker 0: I don't want to spoil it for the people But the point is if he reveals something that's like the best thing ever.

710
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:57,428
Speaker 0: How could you not go to it?

711
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:59,940
Speaker 0: It's like You know, it all depends on what's revealed.

712
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,650
Speaker 1: You should read how the Monty Hall question works.

713
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,140
Speaker 1: But anyway, I like to snort like the match game.

714
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:06,685
Speaker 0: Yeah match game was.

715
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:12,637
Speaker 0: the match game wasn't really about winning It was just about the humor of making That level like that kind of.

716
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:16,687
Speaker 1: I'm a game show host except it's a whole bunch of people all playing that game.

717
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:18,633
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, it's weird.

718
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:19,496
Speaker 0: It's like, you know every.

719
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:34,613
Speaker 0: even though these game shows all all they really have in common is that you had people Competing in some sort of way doing something to win prizes, right even you know Like stuff that didn't even really seem like it was a game show like Takeshi's Castle like you can't win There's.

720
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,850
Speaker 1: there's no winner except the audience, right?

721
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:41,619
Speaker 1: You know, I really like Takeshi's Castle.

722
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,566
Speaker 0: it's pretty much people do something.

723
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,350
Speaker 0: then there's a potential prize.

724
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:49,615
Speaker 0: But really the goal was to make Entertainment right?

725
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:53,510
Speaker 0: It was crafting a game where spectating was you know?

726
00:41:53,861 --> 00:42:00,734
Speaker 0: the Sports sort of have this right but sports also tend to try to make a competition and Entertainment.

727
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:05,389
Speaker 0: at the same time and a lot of times, you know Like a game will be boring because it was just a bad game.

728
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:09,364
Speaker 0: But a game show is pretty much a crafted experience to always be entertaining.

729
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:11,050
Speaker 0: Here's the game fail.

730
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,055
Speaker 1: Here's an idea.

731
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:13,302
Speaker 1: game shows are entertainment, right?

732
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:13,664
Speaker 1: Yep.

733
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,630
Speaker 1: I Think someone should do now they kind of do this with reality TV, but I say make a straight-up game show.

734
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,629
Speaker 1: That and you know ahead of time it's not you hide it.

735
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:28,253
Speaker 1: It's like a basically professional wrestling of a game show a staged all Actors game show.

736
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:30,521
Speaker 1: that itself is basically a comedy drama.

737
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:32,067
Speaker 0: You know what it is for wrestling.

738
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:32,970
Speaker 0: No, you know it is.

739
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:34,499
Speaker 0: It's called the gong show.

740
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,370
Speaker 1: Oh the gong show.

741
00:42:37,592 --> 00:42:40,010
Speaker 0: Hey, dude, you go up and you perfect who can entertain.

742
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:45,870
Speaker 1: Was not that the gong show was more of a sort of like talent competition?

743
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, but it was all about being able to entertain the audience.

744
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,416
Speaker 1: People like it like it made like.

745
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:54,770
Speaker 1: the reason the match game worked is that it was all people who were good at that.

746
00:42:54,872 --> 00:43:02,840
Speaker 1: They were good actors They had jokes ready and it was basically the game show was just kind of like the setting For this comedy of all these people.

747
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,090
Speaker 0: well Hollywood Squares is the same thing also exactly.

748
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:15,350
Speaker 1: But someone should go one step further and not like make a straight-up Fabricated game show that is a TV show because the gimmick of that alone would probably make it weirdly retro popular on TV.

749
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:16,193
Speaker 0: Well, they do have.

750
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:20,610
Speaker 0: there are some reality shows that like only have famous people on them or at least semi-famous people, right?

751
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,976
Speaker 0: So that's you know, a reality show.

752
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,226
Speaker 0: most reality shows aren't actually reality shows.

753
00:43:24,246 --> 00:43:25,050
Speaker 0: They're game shows, right?

754
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:27,718
Speaker 0: Like look at Survivor, right?

755
00:43:27,778 --> 00:43:29,910
Speaker 0: Like I've never actually watched Survivor, but I know how it works.

756
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,663
Speaker 0: They put people on an island and make them do certain game show.

757
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,010
Speaker 1: Yes, basically, what would you do?

758
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like alright everyone.

759
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:38,990
Speaker 0: now you have to eat now you have to eat nasty bugs and it's like wait a minute.

760
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:40,059
Speaker 0: That's not reality.

761
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,326
Speaker 0: That's a game show and then you know The person who's left at the end is the winner and they win a prize.

762
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:44,910
Speaker 0: That's a game show.

763
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:49,870
Speaker 0: If it was a reality show it would be we're dumping you on an island that has hidden cameras everywhere.

764
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,599
Speaker 0: You can do anything you want except tamper with the cameras.

765
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,944
Speaker 0: Whoever's alive.

766
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,409
Speaker 0: That's a reality show.

767
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, a game show.

768
00:43:57,094 --> 00:44:02,270
Speaker 0: everything is so scripted and this you know specific tasks you have to achieve and prizes.

769
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:03,301
Speaker 0: That's a game show.

770
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:08,350
Speaker 1: I Really really liked Family Feud - Family Feud is alright.

771
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:09,555
Speaker 0: I like playing.

772
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:15,216
Speaker 1: Family Feud is the best one to play but to actually Watch it is okay.

773
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:18,510
Speaker 1: I actually really like playing the old NES SNES versions of it.

774
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:26,504
Speaker 0: I like it when we set up one to do anime Family Feud at an at a you know Anime Club or oh my god, this is kind of a tangent, but it's a tragedy.

775
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,030
Speaker 1: but back at RIT anime, right?

776
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,277
Speaker 1: we used to run Family Feud, but it was anime Feud and Because fanboy feud.

777
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:39,730
Speaker 1: Yep, because the people in this anime club actually Watched anime unlike people who go to anime conventions.

778
00:44:40,392 --> 00:44:52,883
Speaker 1: We had some pretty inside baseball questions and topics and people would do surprisingly Well, like if it was something like I don't know How many episodes is an anime on average people in like.

779
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,850
Speaker 1: the top answer is 26 13?

780
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,882
Speaker 1: Like people would give answers that made sense.

781
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:06,190
Speaker 1: We try to run Fanboy feud equivalents and match games at modern anime conventions and we'll be like name a Pokemon and people that whisper to me as the host.

782
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,276
Speaker 0: They're like, what's Pokemon?

783
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:18,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're like name a character from anime who eats too much and they'll be like, uh Pikachu Gee couldn't think of any character.

784
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:25,269
Speaker 0: He's too much even though pretty much every anime has 10 Cuz Eating is their favorite joke.

785
00:45:26,632 --> 00:45:30,630
Speaker 1: But family feud I also enjoyed because people would give some dumb fucking answers.

786
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,018
Speaker 0: Well, I don't care about the dumb answers.

787
00:45:32,058 --> 00:45:34,190
Speaker 0: what I always cared about were the slip-up answers.

788
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,290
Speaker 0: You can always see these on YouTube, which is why I don't need to watch Family Feud.

789
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,249
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know name something's on grandma.

790
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:50,930
Speaker 0: People always accidentally give a match game answer when they're on Family Feud.

791
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:52,475
Speaker 1: I love how match game it was.

792
00:45:52,535 --> 00:46:03,790
Speaker 1: it would quote unquote accidentally like they say something raunchy when really if you look at the questions They were all pre-scripted to do nothing but make as much reference to sex as they could without getting in trouble.

793
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, the family feud thing was like name something that the last thing a burglar wants to see is when he breaks into a house naked.

794
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:18,550
Speaker 1: grandma Used to watch wheel of fortune, but it made me feel really smart and made me really not like other people.

795
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,696
Speaker 0: Yeah wheel of fortune is.

796
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:25,473
Speaker 1: I don't think it's that great Pat Sajak, yeah for some reason I like Pat Sajak really I don't.

797
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,009
Speaker 0: I really actually kind of didn't like him.

798
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:30,070
Speaker 0: I mean, he's not like a bad guy, but it's like the way he came off.

799
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,784
Speaker 0: He didn't come up as like he was like excited came off as one.

800
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:33,749
Speaker 1: It's a job.

801
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:38,670
Speaker 1: Yeah - he's better than these people and he is being degraded by doing this show.

802
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:43,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is why I liked him because you could see all of that through his fake smile.

803
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:47,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but see Alex Trebek was the same sort of way, but it's like I hear he's actually a huge jerk.

804
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:48,758
Speaker 1: I don't know.

805
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:52,638
Speaker 1: I just that's what I hear but Fit the feel of jeopardy.

806
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:56,370
Speaker 1: Pat Sajak fit the pathetic miss of wheel of fortune.

807
00:46:57,895 --> 00:47:01,617
Speaker 0: They definitely do fit their shows but that just because they've done those shows actually.

808
00:47:01,678 --> 00:47:09,404
Speaker 1: because if you want look at you to ever for like wheel of fortune fail because Pat Sajak couldn't like rip into someone who was stupid.

809
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:24,884
Speaker 1: So when someone gave like amazingly Disastrous answers or they guess like X when there's only one spot left in afraid he would always like kind of make this smile and be like Like he'd sigh on the inside like a part of him died.

810
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:27,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then he'd be like Frayed.

811
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:30,104
Speaker 1: that doesn't quite cut it or nope.

812
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:34,409
Speaker 0: Nope You're spitting so-and-so number three.

813
00:47:37,411 --> 00:47:38,576
Speaker 1: I never liked jeopardy though.

814
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:39,339
Speaker 1: I'll be honest.

815
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:43,295
Speaker 0: Well, I mean jeopardy is sort of you know, it's got its good Little kid.

816
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:44,240
Speaker 1: I never knew the answers.

817
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,230
Speaker 0: It's got good parts and bad parts, right?

818
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,565
Speaker 0: You know, it's like it was weird cuz like you'd.

819
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:51,021
Speaker 0: either you know You crush a category or you wouldn't.

820
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:54,109
Speaker 0: or to be about something so obscure That's like only some genius guy.

821
00:47:54,210 --> 00:48:05,338
Speaker 1: Well, once I learned how they prepare people for jeopardy and how the selection process works as a kid I was one much less impressed very much less impressive once I saw learned the buzzer matters a lot more than you know The answer.

822
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:13,163
Speaker 1: and even as a kid I hated the fact that you couldn't just buzz in early and then as when I got into high school and join quiz bowl I hated it even more.

823
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:17,603
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, you know jeopardy is it's sort of fun because you couldn't.

824
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,190
Speaker 0: you know, it's like you can play along at home.

825
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,060
Speaker 0: But then why not just do Trivial Pursuit?

826
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:22,790
Speaker 1: or why not play jeopardy on the SNES?

827
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,715
Speaker 0: Because you run out of answers.

828
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,083
Speaker 0: like I had I had junior jeopardy for the NES.

829
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:29,030
Speaker 0: I learned over time.

830
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,215
Speaker 0: I learned every single answer.

831
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:33,249
Speaker 1: I had wheel of fortune the board game.

832
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:40,890
Speaker 1: My cousin's had that had this huge board with this complicated mechanism for loading up the the phrases and these clickers.

833
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,380
Speaker 1: Yep, it was a surprisingly complex game.

834
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,388
Speaker 0: my cousin with my cousin's also had jeopardy.

835
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:47,573
Speaker 0: the board game Is.

836
00:48:48,016 --> 00:48:50,110
Speaker 0: I never understood why you needed a board game?

837
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:50,691
Speaker 1: It's weird.

838
00:48:50,712 --> 00:48:54,566
Speaker 1: I watched a lot of shows kind of half-assed Lee like I watch anything.

839
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:57,590
Speaker 0: when you're watching a game show It's like you never really give it your full attention.

840
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:02,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'd always watch win lose or draw just because it was on before golden girls, which I watch.

841
00:49:02,892 --> 00:49:07,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know We always watch like wheel of fortune in jeopardy because they were on before or after the evening news.

842
00:49:08,353 --> 00:49:16,450
Speaker 0: On in the kitchen they're eating during dinner, you know I watched Price is Right because it was on after the early morning cartoons and I was home from school and I was eating lunch.

843
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:21,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know, I couldn't play video games while holding a sandwich but like finders keepers.

844
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:21,910
Speaker 1: I hate it.

845
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,918
Speaker 1: I thought it was a stupid like.

846
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:24,490
Speaker 0: really I actually kind of like that one.

847
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:30,110
Speaker 1: I didn't like it mostly because it I always caught that tail end of it and it was toward the end of its run.

848
00:49:30,511 --> 00:49:34,106
Speaker 1: So it looked kind of chintzy compared to it shows that came on after.

849
00:49:34,206 --> 00:49:39,550
Speaker 0: it did look chintzy But the thing I liked about it was all was pretty much the tear apart the room looking for shit part.

850
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:43,290
Speaker 0: The other parts didn't really care about but it wasn't that that was even great entertainment.

851
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:45,198
Speaker 0: It's just at that age.

852
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,910
Speaker 0: I really wanted to do that like a part of room.

853
00:49:47,950 --> 00:50:00,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, go into some fake room that was full of shit and tear it apart looking for something That was actually actually well hidden But not it was like not so hidden that you could never find much better than the find the flag in the goop on double dare.

854
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:01,120
Speaker 1: That was my.

855
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,638
Speaker 0: that was Yeah, double dare was so hit or miss with like.

856
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:14,345
Speaker 1: some of the challenges were really good challenges and some of them were just Sort of broken, but it was funny because when they were broken It's like everyone on the set knew it was broken and laughed about it.

857
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:17,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it was like Oh, wow, those you can't really actually throw those chickens.

858
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:23,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, they sling, you know use the the slingshot to get the eggs in the bowl.

859
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,898
Speaker 0: It's like you get half an egg in the bowl.

860
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:27,048
Speaker 0: you won because no one could possibly do that.

861
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:30,076
Speaker 1: at least Double dare the questions looking back.

862
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:34,930
Speaker 1: I remember again really hating the kids up there who never knew the answers to anything.

863
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,200
Speaker 0: I don't know why double dare even bothered with the questions.

864
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,373
Speaker 0: They should just done physical challenges all the time Yeah and they should.

865
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:47,089
Speaker 1: it had like three levels every now and then you'd see like there'd be a smart kid or like two smart kids and They were just answer every question to do no physical challenges and win.

866
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:52,910
Speaker 0: But at least but at least on double dare the obstacle course always actually worked pretty well.

867
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,710
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I want that to be the omegathon finale.

868
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:01,107
Speaker 0: I don't like obstacle course like the hidden temple where incompetent people would just go in and be like derp derp derp.

869
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:06,940
Speaker 0: No one really derped the double dare Obstacle course, they would just physically fail.

870
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, they wouldn't derp it out of losing.

871
00:51:08,971 --> 00:51:10,230
Speaker 0: You know not knowing what the fuck to do I

872
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:20,546
Speaker 1: always was vaguely like I wanted to be on double dare because some of the things were really crazy And I just wanted to do them like the the bubble gum Machine where you jump into the top and like just fall through that funnel.

873
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,489
Speaker 0: Yeah Some of them were pretty good.

874
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:30,788
Speaker 0: You know some of the most fun ones like were the ones you stayed clean was like the big The the gopher wheel or the hurt the hamster hamster wheel.

875
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:35,650
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, there's a hamster maze also the wheel where you just run in the wheel enough to get out all the way through.

876
00:51:36,091 --> 00:51:42,314
Speaker 0: But then some of the ones that were actually tricky like here is a slippery surface covered in like chocolate syrup make it to the Other end.

877
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:42,656
Speaker 0: Yep.

878
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,408
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, yeah, let's do that.

879
00:51:46,472 --> 00:51:49,350
Speaker 0: But yeah, man there was a. it's weird because there was like this whole job.

880
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,170
Speaker 0: It was like two genres like the whole kids game shows versus the adult game shows.

881
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:57,019
Speaker 0: But I watched both even though it was the same age Yeah And I watched a lot of reruns.

882
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:03,165
Speaker 1: and like when I was little I watched like press your luck Mm-hmm, and I didn't even pay attention to it enough to really understand the rules.

883
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:03,948
Speaker 1: I just watched it.

884
00:52:04,651 --> 00:52:10,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I remember is no, I mean, oh, let me hit the button at the right time The little whammy animation would happen.

885
00:52:10,998 --> 00:52:12,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was always fun to watch the way of animation.

886
00:52:13,107 --> 00:52:14,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird It's kind of like I want.

887
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,590
Speaker 1: when I was really young I watched game shows the same way that I played video games.

888
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:20,939
Speaker 1: Wasn't really trying to win or paying attention?

889
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:22,967
Speaker 1: just kind of doing what kids do not 100% sent you.

890
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,613
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I was.

891
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:29,232
Speaker 0: I wasn't trying to win because like I wasn't playing but I was yelling by the time the Hidden Temple was On.

892
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,039
Speaker 0: I was yelling.

893
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,470
Speaker 0: I was like, are you stupid?

894
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:37,029
Speaker 0: How could you not know how to put together the fucking silver monkey, you know Why have you not even watched this show if I was there?

895
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,732
Speaker 1: I'm Scott if

896
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:44,730
Speaker 0: my partner failed to put together the silver monkey and then when they came out of there I want to punch them in the face so hard kicked him right in the junk

897
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,132
Speaker 1: Silver

898
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:50,088
Speaker 0: my I would have taken the silver monkey and shoved it right down his throat like you cost me fucking trip to.

899
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,479
Speaker 0: oh my god I kill you being slightly older.

900
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,307
Speaker 1: I at least know now that they filmed it all in one go So the kids on it couldn't have seen it.

901
00:52:57,233 --> 00:53:04,325
Speaker 0: I'm just saying in the second end by season two then in season two You should have fucking known how to put together the silver fucking monkey.

902
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:09,830
Speaker 1: worse than that I think and I hate amazing me that I'll say it was worse than that where the kids on Nick arcade.

903
00:53:11,053 --> 00:53:18,090
Speaker 1: They just like kids you've never played a video game in their lives The final battle where you go inside the video game and it was that crappy blue screen.

904
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,850
Speaker 1: Yeah kids just like didn't listen to the host at all.

905
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:27,750
Speaker 1: He'd be like like this one this one video I watched again recently because I remembered it from my childhood.

906
00:53:28,114 --> 00:53:30,735
Speaker 1: there's this one kid and He's one.

907
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:39,310
Speaker 1: all he has to do is reach up and touch something Yeah, and there's like 20 seconds left with all the monsters pause before they start up again.

908
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:44,738
Speaker 1: He just kind of stands there like looking around and the guy's like all you have to do Come on, just put your hand up.

909
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,770
Speaker 1: all you just put just grab it all you.

910
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,022
Speaker 1: I'll just put your head and then the kid dies and loses.

911
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,570
Speaker 1: He's like, ah, you gave it your best.

912
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:53,678
Speaker 0: That was your best.

913
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,208
Speaker 0: kill yourself, where's that kid now?

914
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:56,956
Speaker 1: There's no way.

915
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:58,610
Speaker 0: he made an interview him on nerd alert.

916
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:03,089
Speaker 0: They seem to love interviewing people who are like, you know, we should suggest that.

917
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,958
Speaker 0: But anyway, I never liked like.

918
00:54:05,978 --> 00:54:07,443
Speaker 0: I remember it was a busy.

919
00:54:07,483 --> 00:54:09,370
Speaker 0: It's just frustrating in general, right?

920
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:19,384
Speaker 0: Even if it's not a game show to watch somebody fail at something that is so easy for you yourself to do Right, even if you're just watching someone play Mario 1 and they run to the first Goomba.

921
00:54:19,686 --> 00:54:20,830
Speaker 0: It's just frustrated babies.

922
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:22,029
Speaker 1: You can't swing this high.

923
00:54:22,616 --> 00:54:28,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know You watch someone try to ride a bicycle and they just keep falling over and it's like oh, come on.

924
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:28,678
Speaker 0: Really?

925
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:29,340
Speaker 0: Come on.

926
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,899
Speaker 0: Or watch someone swimming in a pool in the drowning.

927
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,904
Speaker 0: It's like really kick.

928
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:35,049
Speaker 0: Is it kick?

929
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:36,293
Speaker 0: Kick.

930
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,840
Speaker 1: I guess what bothered me the most wasn't the uncommon.

931
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,874
Speaker 1: so simple because that was more that was entertaining to be so angry at these children But it was.

932
00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:50,430
Speaker 1: I hated the game shows when I realized that there was no skill involved or that the initial rounds didn't matter.

933
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:52,089
Speaker 1: Anything that had a poorly designed game?

934
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:57,470
Speaker 0: Really bothered me like yeah, cuz like you'd watch something like guts right and some of the things on guts.

935
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,375
Speaker 0: Well, actually like pretty cool, you know, like the obstacle course part None of it mattered.

936
00:55:01,415 --> 00:55:03,490
Speaker 1: the agro Craig was worth more points than fucking anything.

937
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,438
Speaker 0: I know that we had to get to the agro Craig, right?

938
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:11,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, but hey, but there were other things that were kind of boring Like like bungee jump basketball.

939
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,485
Speaker 0: It's like alright boring.

940
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:14,970
Speaker 0: Why do they even have that here?

941
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:29,829
Speaker 0: You know, it should have been more like American gladiators Was on right after Saturday morning cartoons and right before pro wrestling and it was the perfect cross between the two.

942
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:33,010
Speaker 0: I love that shit so much because it was the closest thing.

943
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:40,930
Speaker 1: But all those gladiators run roids so much to gladiatorial combat the fact that it was direct direct fucking competition.

944
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,873
Speaker 1: It was the kind of thing that you always wanted to do I mean as a kid.

945
00:55:43,994 --> 00:55:48,490
Speaker 0: even then some of the games are more entertaining than some of the others are like joust was the shit?

946
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,240
Speaker 0: Yes, but like put.

947
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:51,910
Speaker 0: you know, the volleyballs in the basket.

948
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:57,525
Speaker 0: That was okay, but it wasn't as good as you know, the cages into the things was great.

949
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,568
Speaker 0: That was okay.

950
00:55:58,689 --> 00:55:59,170
Speaker 0: It was okay.

951
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:06,146
Speaker 1: I also like the one where you had to get on the the hanging suspended rings and make your way across Because no one ever made it across and they grab you with their legs.

952
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:06,850
Speaker 1: Just pull you down.

953
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:12,582
Speaker 0: Oh the one where you had to there was the sea of And the guy was coming after you.

954
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:13,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I seen it.

955
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:20,897
Speaker 0: The thing is it was so awesome at American gladiators when there's a hard game like that and the the the competitor was just so Good, they actually did it.

956
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:21,441
Speaker 0: It was like fuck.

957
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at that guy.

958
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,385
Speaker 0: He totally did it and it was the thing about American gladiators.

959
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:30,066
Speaker 0: It was sort of like You know that the the Japanese thing.

960
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:30,590
Speaker 0: what's it called?

961
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:31,473
Speaker 1: Takeshi's castle?

962
00:56:31,573 --> 00:56:33,322
Speaker 0: No, the one that Nagano won.

963
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:34,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, what the hell is that?

964
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:35,010
Speaker 1: Ninja warrior?

965
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's it's what's it really called because it begins with an S. I'm gonna look it up real quick.

966
00:56:40,547 --> 00:56:42,656
Speaker 0: Okay, Sasuke It's sort of like it was.

967
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:49,750
Speaker 0: Sasuke was like designed to be really impossible But American gladiator was like, you know Sasuke is also on your own.

968
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,557
Speaker 0: It's like what can you do on your own?

969
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:58,720
Speaker 0: but American gladiator was like versus Sasuke against these Steroid lunatics and I really like direct competition.

970
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,950
Speaker 0: Yes, but also the games were less ridiculous.

971
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,950
Speaker 0: It's like they were balls hard, but they weren't impossible hard.

972
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:12,569
Speaker 0: My favorite I think was the one with the guns and you had yeah, you had to go from station to station shooting different pieces of

973
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:18,677
Speaker 1: No one almost almost no one ever hit with anything and had to get all the way to the end like throw the grenades up There the

974
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:19,425
Speaker 0: tennis balls.

975
00:57:19,627 --> 00:57:26,370
Speaker 0: Yep I loved it though in something you would shoot the gladiator to disrupt them right with that with like the the air-powered like missile.

976
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:32,170
Speaker 0: But I was always impressed when somebody would just go up there grab the first weapon and shoot the target and be like dang.

977
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:41,310
Speaker 0: And he'd be like, yeah, that's right bitches yep, but I love they always gave me that last chance to escape and That tennis ball that the gladiator shot you with had to hurt us like oh my god.

978
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,339
Speaker 1: I saw a replay where hit a guy on an ankle.

979
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,284
Speaker 1: He had a bruise.

980
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:45,690
Speaker 1: That was it was amazing.

981
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:48,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd sue if that game show still exists.

982
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:52,612
Speaker 0: But yeah, no man there was Like.

983
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:53,736
Speaker 0: it's so surprising.

984
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:59,457
Speaker 0: It's like you don't realize it, but there were so many of these game shows And I liked almost all of them.

985
00:57:59,637 --> 00:58:02,087
Speaker 1: I mean as wild and crazy kids that was.

986
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:02,990
Speaker 0: I didn't like it that much.

987
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,700
Speaker 0: I watched it cuz it was on my watch.

988
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,544
Speaker 1: It was on before.

989
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:09,541
Speaker 0: something like It was on when you got home from school and it actually was.

990
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:12,401
Speaker 0: they were only a few episodes and they showed him over and over again.

991
00:58:13,787 --> 00:58:17,040
Speaker 1: Uh Who can forget the acapella ditty?

992
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,270
Speaker 1: from where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

993
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, people forget that that was a game show.

994
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:24,650
Speaker 0: right the game show was actually the first thing and it was the biggest thing.

995
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,602
Speaker 0: But everyone remembers like the video game and mostly now.

996
00:58:27,702 --> 00:58:29,430
Speaker 0: but the game show was actually really great.

997
00:58:29,732 --> 00:58:34,038
Speaker 1: Just the music the cast was funny They had a high production values for what it was.

998
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:36,526
Speaker 0: and that was yet again the kids were stupid.

999
00:58:36,606 --> 00:58:43,769
Speaker 0: yet again the frustrating Final event where you had to put the sticks on the countries and because I had watched the show I knew every fucking country.

1000
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:46,819
Speaker 0: And these kids just didn't fucking know it.

1001
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,863
Speaker 0: and it was the worst thing.

1002
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:48,446
Speaker 0: kids didn't even know.

1003
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:49,430
Speaker 0: it's like their own state.

1004
00:58:49,932 --> 00:58:51,779
Speaker 0: It was like you just need to go die in a fire.

1005
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:52,361
Speaker 0: You don't know.

1006
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:54,730
Speaker 0: you got us map is your final challenge.

1007
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:55,814
Speaker 0: It's not like they gave you.

1008
00:58:55,894 --> 00:58:59,988
Speaker 0: you know Africa or Asia right you got us state and you failed it.

Speaker 0: we need to.

1012
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,775
Speaker 0: I think we need to bring back more of the these older game shows and Less of the reality shows.

1013
00:59:10,795 --> 00:59:12,180
Speaker 1: I just want more.

1014
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,087
Speaker 1: I want different kinds of game shows.

1015
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:16,403
Speaker 1: I want unique stuff I want like the Monopoly game.

1016
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:17,230
Speaker 0: That's awful.

1017
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:24,761
Speaker 1: I loved Monopoly the board game as a kid when I was stupid and I heard oh There's gonna be in a Monopoly game show and I was just excited.

1018
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:25,745
Speaker 0: I really wanted to watch it.

1019
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:26,167
Speaker 0: real bad.

1020
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:38,700
Speaker 1: the opening theme Oh and oh P o ly and I'm halfway through it and I realized that at no point the skill or Intelligence have anything to do with who win.

1021
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,550
Speaker 0: I really wanted to watch and I was able to watch it like once or twice.

1022
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:49,386
Speaker 0: I don't remember how it worked But like it was something about the timing of it or like it got replaced with other shows so quickly because it was so bad I didn't get to see it that much.

1023
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:52,921
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like I really wanted to watch it very badly.

1024
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:54,810
Speaker 0: You know when I was when I knew it was coming out?

1025
00:59:55,493 --> 00:59:58,869
Speaker 1: Oh, well, so Scott I had to get the years before I called you on this.

1026
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:04,382
Speaker 1: You said that Carmen Sandiego the game show was the first.

1027
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:05,785
Speaker 1: Carmen Sandiego was I wrong?

1028
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,510
Speaker 1: you're wrong so hard.

1029
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,337
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I can't believe that because I was.

1030
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:09,879
Speaker 0: I was very.

1031
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:10,822
Speaker 0: I was so sure.

1032
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:13,131
Speaker 1: show debuted in 1991.

1033
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:19,050
Speaker 0: I was so sure that all of the video games and everything else were based on the game show on TV.

1034
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:20,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, really?

1035
01:00:20,114 --> 01:00:21,560
Speaker 0: I guess I was totally wrong.

1036
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:22,404
Speaker 1: You're wrong.

1037
01:00:22,424 --> 01:00:23,730
Speaker 0: Why did the first video game come out?

1038
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,462
Speaker 1: So, alright, so the program aired on PBS.

1039
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:30,752
Speaker 1: Yep from 1991 until 1995.

1040
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:34,563
Speaker 1: All right, the first video game came out.

1041
01:00:35,285 --> 01:00:41,557
Speaker 1: Well, it was proposed in 1983 and The first game came out in 1985.

1042
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:41,738
Speaker 1: Oh, I fail.

1043
01:00:41,778 --> 01:00:45,119
Speaker 0: I Can't believe.

1044
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:45,527
Speaker 0: that's weird.

1045
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:47,778
Speaker 1: It's not that weird.

1046
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:48,464
Speaker 0: It's weird.

1047
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,773
Speaker 0: It's Broderbund Yeah, but it's like.

1048
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,118
Speaker 0: the thing is is like the these.

1049
01:00:52,239 --> 01:01:01,006
Speaker 0: the format of the video game and the format of the gate of the Game show are actually so similar That I was so sure that the video game was based off the game show because

1050
01:01:01,026 --> 01:01:06,854
Speaker 1: it was very rare For a game show based on anything to in any way resemble the thing it was based on Mm-hmm.

1051
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:08,929
Speaker 1: That's why some of the best video games were.

1052
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:17,130
Speaker 0: the Game shows were the ones that weren't based on yeah I guess you could categorize game shows right just things that were based on other things and things that were based on nothing like prices.

1053
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:19,684
Speaker 0: Right isn't based on anything, but there was a game show for Scrabble.

1054
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:28,062
Speaker 0: remember that It was actually pretty bad hit a really bad time slot but like $100,000 pyramid was based on nothing Yeah, you know except itself.

1055
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:29,490
Speaker 1: That was all right getting Egypt.

1056
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:36,890
Speaker 0: But yeah, I guess I think the best game shows though if I think back are the ones that are based on nothing but themselves.

1057
01:01:37,454 --> 01:01:43,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're also the ones that either were Contrived like match game where we're basically just funny the whole time.

1058
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:46,752
Speaker 1: Yeah ones that were actual games Mm-hmm.

1059
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:51,897
Speaker 0: We need to we need to come up with something, you know We'll see hopper.
