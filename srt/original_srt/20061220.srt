1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,458
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 20th.

2
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,270
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and I'm Rin, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,563
Speaker 0: Tonight we discuss dubs.

4
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:20,848
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:31,563
Speaker 1: So weekly anime review kind of punked us in that despite the fact that we have you know 200 and a lot episodes under our belt like 250 or something like that.

6
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:33,549
Speaker 1: We don't have our t-shirts out.

7
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:36,650
Speaker 0: yet We don't even have anything to put on the t-shirts.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,287
Speaker 1: Well, we have lots of things to put on the t-shirts But they're very conceptual and not very actually drawn on a piece of paper.

9
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:55,370
Speaker 1: Yeah but yet they took it upon themselves to Take advantage of the popular swag for swag program whereby any Podcast who sends us swag will get swag in return, but we don't have anything yet.

10
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,189
Speaker 1: So it's kind of just rubbing salt in the wounds.

11
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:09,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't think we've mentioned that program before but if you send geek nights your swag We will send you equivalent geek night swag provided you are a legitimate cosplayer.

12
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:14,378
Speaker 1: a cosplayer No, not cosplayer Legitimate podcaster.

13
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,804
Speaker 0: Well, you don't have to be a podcaster.

14
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:16,989
Speaker 0: You might be a webcomic.

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,509
Speaker 0: er Yeah, or you know something else.

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:30,236
Speaker 1: But but if our friend Peter sends us a white t-shirt where he has written the name Peter on it in black marker We were not going to send him a geek night shirt No and said we'll sell him.

17
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,344
Speaker 0: you send him a turd in an envelope.

18
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:33,810
Speaker 0: that is a fair exchange.

19
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,900
Speaker 1: It has to be a polished one.

20
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:36,935
Speaker 0: Yes Right.

21
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's speaking of other podcasters.

22
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:50,110
Speaker 1: For those of you who listen to anime world order, which is a decent number of you I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of crossover between our Wednesday listeners and anime world order.

23
00:01:50,976 --> 00:02:02,230
Speaker 1: They recently had their one year anniversary special which consisted of episode 42 and At the end of that episode there was a short audio drama.

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:14,255
Speaker 1: If you want to call it that I will say that in terms of the actual source material, I think it was very faithful To the spirit.

25
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,010
Speaker 1: I mean that that stuff is pretty much unintelligible anyway.

26
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,323
Speaker 0: So we're we act in it.

27
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:22,510
Speaker 0: We have two bit parts.

28
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:29,509
Speaker 0: So if you want to hear us do something funny You can go listen to the end of the newest anime world order as of right now.

29
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,183
Speaker 1: yep, and we will congratulate them on successfully completing 42 episodes in 52 weeks.

30
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:42,788
Speaker 0: and It just reminded me if that's their one year anniversary We're even podcasting longer than they have.

31
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:44,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have.

32
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:47,510
Speaker 1: so I guess that makes us uh, I don't know veterans.

33
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:49,918
Speaker 0: We're definitely their seniors.

34
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:50,924
Speaker 0: They have to call a senpai.

35
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:54,244
Speaker 1: They'd better call a senpai Because we're probably gonna see him at katsu-kan.

36
00:02:54,405 --> 00:03:01,664
Speaker 1: That's right bitches Right, so in the news we'll get right to it because the use there is.

37
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:06,850
Speaker 1: it isn't often that there's anime news We really feel like talking about or we care about in any stretch.

38
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,661
Speaker 1: I mean, we're not gonna tell you that some company licensed some show.

39
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:11,704
Speaker 1: That's just not what we do.

40
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:17,767
Speaker 0: We're not gonna tell you Oh OMG some you know movie got this many tickets sold.

41
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:23,984
Speaker 1: Ooh Yeah, and I don't even anime world order often has trouble finding interesting anime news.

42
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:27,327
Speaker 0: Lucas anime news just tends to be bland.

43
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,997
Speaker 1: Except oh this DVD came out Except when fans are involved.

44
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,186
Speaker 1: because you see you might all remember that before last year's.

45
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:46,488
Speaker 1: well this previous Otacon They made some changes to the artist alley rules and as a result the internet as a collective body Decided to go apeshit.

46
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:50,567
Speaker 0: At least the internet the part of the internet that cares about Otacon.

47
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,790
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, the thing is anyone who wants to cause a ruckus on the internet can do it easily.

48
00:03:55,212 --> 00:03:56,720
Speaker 1: I don't care if there's only two of you.

49
00:03:56,741 --> 00:04:02,154
Speaker 1: if you're loud enough on the internet It can seem like thousands of people it can Go to enough websites.

50
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:05,666
Speaker 1: Yep, or just make them up enough noise or have enough shill accounts on dig.

51
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:06,970
Speaker 0: No shill accounts.

52
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,699
Speaker 1: But anyway The Otacon thing.

53
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,990
Speaker 1: long story short we covered this in great detail.

54
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,728
Speaker 1: We did a bunch of interviews everything about it.

55
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:26,930
Speaker 1: Otacon changes policy to Generally restrict, you know bootlegs or fan art that is blatantly violating copyrights in mass quantities things like that.

56
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:34,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rule used to be that if you manufactured plush Pikachu's you couldn't sell those because well, that's illegal.

57
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,109
Speaker 0: But if you drew a picture of Pikachu, that was cool.

58
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:46,978
Speaker 0: So they changed the rule to sort of not totally disallow you from selling a picture of Pikachu that you drew but To sort of discourage it.

59
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:47,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

60
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,490
Speaker 1: Well, you can listen to our previous episodes about that to get the details, right?

61
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,412
Speaker 1: but suffice to say there were people who were disappointed with this change or who didn't understand it and as a result were very Indignant.

62
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:00,541
Speaker 1: and while they were it was a relatively small number of people.

63
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:15,910
Speaker 1: They did make a very large internet ruckus and That may have been justified except for the fact that the actual result of Otacon's rule change was that artist Ally carried on pretty much as usual and in fact, if anything the quality was improved.

64
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:26,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd say the artist Ally definitely I mean the number one thing that was always wrong with that artist Ally anyway was a bad Arrangement of tables for inefficient space usage and they seem to have fixed that.

65
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,130
Speaker 1: Yeah I think it's pretty much as good as it can be in that regard.

66
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:32,080
Speaker 1: But the whole sky is falling.

67
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,929
Speaker 1: thing of the people who were complaining about Otacon's artist Ally.

68
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:41,970
Speaker 1: rules Really didn't come to pass and the artist Ally Almost everyone who went could do just about what they would have done anyway, and everything worked out really well.

69
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:43,874
Speaker 0: So some hot art.

70
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:48,187
Speaker 1: so I have some of that hot art sitting right over there waiting to be framed still.

71
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:54,347
Speaker 1: Oh god So it ended and the save artist Ally people went back into the woodwork.

72
00:05:54,968 --> 00:06:07,650
Speaker 1: until now Katsu khan is coming up and they have made some changes to their artist Ally and the generally same group of people is Making almost the exact same ruckus with in fact the same live journal community.

73
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:08,772
Speaker 0: Great.

74
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:14,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's basically the same issue except that the rules changes are a little bit odd.

75
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,709
Speaker 1: So I guess we'll cover them a bit.

76
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:21,708
Speaker 1: but in terms of that the main argument here is the same as with Otacon that the people are mad about.

77
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:28,800
Speaker 1: you know Katsu khan changing the way they handle the artist Ally and making rules that Exclude what some of them like to do in the artist Ally.

78
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:35,890
Speaker 1: and the argument that they made When Otacon was coming was that the artist Ally is going to suck and no one is going to on a table.

79
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,341
Speaker 1: Yet the artist Ally at Otacon sold out.

80
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:40,210
Speaker 1: I don't know within a half a second.

81
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,870
Speaker 0: Well, I think the rules that they were originally angry about weren't the rules that ended up actually being the real rules at Otacon.

82
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,840
Speaker 0: so it's not really a An equivalent situation true.

83
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:56,238
Speaker 1: there was in fact a large Miscommunication on Otacon's part as to what the rules.

84
00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:02,386
Speaker 0: it was sort of like someone coming up and saying hey if you cross this Street you go to jail for ten years what that's crazy.

85
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:07,810
Speaker 0: No, just kidding If you cross the street, then we just hit you on the head a little bit a little bit.

86
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,171
Speaker 1: Yeah,

87
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:13,690
Speaker 0: so and that you know, it's like people yelled and screamed about the first thing but the second one they were like, all right

88
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:25,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I was reading through the various protests against Katsu khan on this and a lot of them look like the same people and if they're not the same people they write with the exact same style.

89
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:46,761
Speaker 1: almost every complaint I've seen is someone who starts off by either quoting or making up a quote about International copyright law or possibly the First Amendment Claiming that Katsu khan or as they did with Otacon is is being unfair or violating some human right that they have or Ruining their livelihood or going to ruin the artist alley.

90
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:47,884
Speaker 1: and then they go.

91
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:52,599
Speaker 1: then they go on to make some statement like Well, good luck with an empty artist alley.

92
00:07:52,699 --> 00:08:00,126
Speaker 1: and I'll just note before we continue that despite these rules changes Katsu khan's artist alley is sold out as expected.

93
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,959
Speaker 0: Oh Well, look at that.

94
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:02,646
Speaker 1: So, huh?

95
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,259
Speaker 0: Well, was it sold out before the rule changes or after?

96
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,434
Speaker 0: how many of those people who bought a table knew the rules changes and Actually comprehended them?

97
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:21,589
Speaker 1: in their mind it the rules changes are pretty straightforward and from all the argument looks like most of the people arguing Didn't actually get a table anyway.

98
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:27,049
Speaker 0: Or maybe they just didn't buy one because they saw the rules and then decided not to.

99
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:32,710
Speaker 1: yeah But even if that's the case, it doesn't matter because there were enough people who despite the rules changes wanted a table.

100
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:41,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how many of those people actually read the rule changes and how many of them I can guarantee that all of them Because of the way Katsu khan handles artist alley now.

101
00:08:41,745 --> 00:08:42,929
Speaker 0: really how did they handle it now?

102
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:55,627
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is we'll go over the rules changes first because part of that is how they handle the artist alley itself Because it isn't quite as clear-cut as caught as Otakon with their and be careful with fan art.

103
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:56,730
Speaker 1: Don't bootleg.

104
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,940
Speaker 1: The first rule they've added is that now this is really the big one.

105
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:07,269
Speaker 1: quote artist alley is intended for amateur artists working in a print paper medium.

106
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,496
Speaker 0: So what about the webcomic artists?

107
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:10,881
Speaker 0: They can't go to artist alley.

108
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:12,488
Speaker 1: I guess not.

109
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:19,967
Speaker 1: technically It is also intended for artists who make 3d renditions of their own art or 3d renditions of licensed anime characters.

110
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:25,830
Speaker 1: in that spirit Artists are required to use 75% or more of their table space for such art.

111
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,468
Speaker 1: So I guess geek nights could not have a table in the artist alley there.

112
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:33,480
Speaker 0: What about like a guy who sells cool t-shirts or something?

113
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,640
Speaker 0: Nope.

114
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,342
Speaker 1: Can't do that.

115
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:35,064
Speaker 0: What if you like?

116
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:39,215
Speaker 0: you sew cool hats You do crafts.

117
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:40,319
Speaker 0: Crafts are no good.

118
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:40,640
Speaker 1: Nope.

119
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,703
Speaker 1: Anything like that has been.

120
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:51,830
Speaker 1: in fact, I remember last year at Katsucon there was an issue with someone who had a table in artist alley Who was selling chain mail and they either asked him to leave or disapproved of what he was doing.

121
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,114
Speaker 1: I don't remember the details.

122
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,460
Speaker 1: see since I was very drunk.

123
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,090
Speaker 0: that doesn't even anything to do with copyright or anything at all.

124
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,754
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's not.

125
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,510
Speaker 1: That's why I'm saying that the Katsucon issue is a little bit different.

126
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:15,343
Speaker 1: They're not just changing the rules for copyright but they are definitely trying to shape the kinds of things that are in their artist alley and they're trying to at least in my Eyes make it distinct from other conventions.

127
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:17,929
Speaker 0: artist alleys Yeah, make it distinct.

128
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,426
Speaker 0: But also what people like about anime convention artist alleys is that they have these other things.

129
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,516
Speaker 0: those things make a lot of money A lot of.

130
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:26,949
Speaker 0: why would they get rid of those things?

131
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they even if your artist alley still sells out, you know as a con you don't care.

132
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:37,228
Speaker 0: You know about not bringing in artist alley revenue that way but you might care about.

133
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:47,470
Speaker 0: you know People who come to cons who really enjoy artist alley might not enjoy your artist alley anymore though And then Katsucon will get a reputation for having a bad artist alley.

134
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,650
Speaker 0: It doesn't have cool stuff like chain mail and crafts and and all that other goodies.

135
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:58,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, they definitely seem to want to encourage original art by original artist on paper and very little if anything else.

136
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,763
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's a go to a comic-con.

137
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,010
Speaker 0: if you want that this is an anime.

138
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:05,570
Speaker 1: Well, at least I mean in terms of a lot of the cool t-shirts.

139
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:11,570
Speaker 1: You see it a lot of cons in the artist alley tend to be ripoffs of licensed things and illegal and banned.

140
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:17,050
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but most of the cool t-shirts are that guy's a webcomic artist and those are his t-shirts.

141
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,210
Speaker 0: You know that that's where I see the cool ones.

142
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:27,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure but it does look like they really wouldn't allow Webcomic artists unless they were drawing stuff or just selling their own art and they weren't really promoting.

143
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,026
Speaker 0: What if I'm a webcomic artist like order the stick but now I have a book.

144
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:31,709
Speaker 0: is that okay?

145
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,094
Speaker 1: I don't know.

146
00:11:33,174 --> 00:11:42,700
Speaker 1: but it does say let's see that the artist alley reserves the right to refuse and turn away any artist selling solely Fabrics trinkets or other merchandise not appropriate for artist alley.

147
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,724
Speaker 1: Selling of commercial merchandise is prohibited.

148
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,312
Speaker 0: Well that that's a Given.

149
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,175
Speaker 1: but no, but they don't.

150
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:52,445
Speaker 1: if that's true then selling your own published book is commercial merchandise.

151
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,239
Speaker 1: Oh, wow You didn't think of that part.

152
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,585
Speaker 0: So what if you are An independent comic artist who self-publishes your own books?

153
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:06,260
Speaker 1: you can't sell your books there Technically according to what they've got written on the website.

154
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,850
Speaker 0: No, so isn't that sort of going against themselves?

155
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:16,447
Speaker 0: It's like we want this artist alley to be only for artists or you know amateurs working in the print medium But you can't actually sell their stuff.

156
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:17,976
Speaker 1: They also.

157
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:20,890
Speaker 1: artists may not solely display and sell fan art.

158
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:25,866
Speaker 1: It is strongly suggested that fan art should not make up more than 25% of your tablespace.

159
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:30,422
Speaker 1: Fan art and print should be kept to 20 copies or less.

160
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:32,850
Speaker 0: Well, at least they're not just saying no fan art.

161
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,118
Speaker 0: They're saying well they have.

162
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,370
Speaker 1: I mean if they actually said no fan art Which the thing is with the original Otacon thing?

163
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:52,970
Speaker 1: I would have been in a little bit up in arms too with the original rules where they actually Said they were going to ban fan art straight up and then when they clarified that that was not the case Everyone settled down except for the very very dedicated opponents.

164
00:12:53,552 --> 00:13:00,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it here I mean if there's an artist alley without fan art I I don't know if I'd care to even wander into it.

165
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,537
Speaker 1: I mean I see enough original art online as it is and I usually don't go to an anime con looking for original art.

166
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:12,982
Speaker 1: if anything I go to an anime con looking for new web comics to read and Cool art that probably is based on some sort of licensed property.

167
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you go to a comic-con, right?

168
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,902
Speaker 0: You know you you're not going around looking for new stuff.

169
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,110
Speaker 0: the people with new stuff are trying to hawk it on you.

170
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:24,655
Speaker 0: But you tend to avoid those people, you know all those guys are like.

171
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:32,404
Speaker 0: I like spider-man and I want to get spider-man art and Anyone that you walk up to at a comic-con no matter what the artist is.

172
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:35,828
Speaker 0: They'll draw you a spider-man Whatever, you know.

173
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:44,570
Speaker 0: So if you go to an anime con and you like them full metal alchemists and you can't get a full metal alchemist What that what kind of defeats the part?

174
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:51,430
Speaker 1: You know I can't get my picture of Roy and Al and link and Epona all kissing each other then this is not an anime con.

175
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:52,354
Speaker 0: I know it's.

176
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:53,339
Speaker 0: it's what.

177
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:54,786
Speaker 0: is it an independent art con?

178
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:55,188
Speaker 0: It's not.

179
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:58,053
Speaker 0: It's an anime con.

180
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,699
Speaker 0: There should be anime and manga everywhere.

181
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,480
Speaker 0: That's what it's about.

182
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:13,100
Speaker 1: well that see that's what it traditionally is about, but it looks like they're definitely trying to Push the way the katsu kans artist alley is to make it different from other cons.

183
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:15,571
Speaker 1: I can't say if it'll be successful or not.

184
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:17,380
Speaker 1: We'll be there and we'll see it firsthand.

185
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:37,186
Speaker 1: now the other interesting part of this and this is what I was alluding to in the beginning in terms of enforcement a part of the process of getting an artist alley table is that you have to give them a list of All the items you plan to sell in the artist alley and then they personally approve or disapprove of you And if they approve you get a table.

186
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:38,190
Speaker 1: if they disapprove you don't.

187
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:42,000
Speaker 0: so they've already approved the whole artist so that's well.

188
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:51,860
Speaker 1: So everyone who is currently got a table in the artist alley is fully aware of the rules and unless they're lying on that Form in which case they're gonna be in for a load of trouble when they get to the con.

189
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,639
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, huh?

190
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:56,187
Speaker 0: I think that's actually a pretty good idea.

191
00:14:56,207 --> 00:15:09,812
Speaker 0: is that if they tell the con what they're selling before they get there or Actually like said a sampling of work to the con before they get there that way the con can arrange the artist alley in a Much more efficient fashion, you know with like goes with like.

192
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:15,778
Speaker 0: or possibly, you know Put don't put all the really popular things right next to each other to clog up the aisles, etc.

193
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:15,898
Speaker 0: Etc.

194
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:17,805
Speaker 0: That's a good thing.

195
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:24,754
Speaker 1: I think another interesting thing they're doing with the artist alley Now is that if you have a table you have to claim it by 9 p.m.

196
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:25,979
Speaker 1: On Friday or you lose it.

197
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:27,908
Speaker 0: No, that's that's cool cuz.

198
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:41,620
Speaker 0: a lot of people try to get those tables and they you know They buy it up for the whole weekend and they only sit there for like a few hours on Saturday And then someone else who couldn't get a table who would have sat there all weekend and really wanted to sell their stuff.

199
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,289
Speaker 0: You know, it's yeah, normally

200
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:55,340
Speaker 1: I would be against any sort of restriction like that But just due to the fact that Cons like Hobsicon and Otacon have such limited space as it is if you're not gonna use the table all weekend Then it will probably be better served in someone else's hands.

201
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:02,100
Speaker 0: Yeah If your demand for artists alley is bigger than your supply for of tables Then you have to have a rule like that just to make it fair.

202
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:06,840
Speaker 0: If your demand is not that high then having a rule like that is kind of annoying.

203
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:13,660
Speaker 1: I guess in the end these rules seem a little bit draconian But we'll have to actually go to katsucon to see how it turns out.

204
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:18,060
Speaker 1: Unless we get an interview with someone from katsucon or something.

205
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,319
Speaker 1: I think we'll just leave it at that for now and we'll report on it again after we go.

206
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:30,777
Speaker 0: So it doesn't sound good because at least Otacon, you know when the first rules came out Everyone was like that's not what the rules are gonna be and then it wasn't what the rules ended up being.

207
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:34,549
Speaker 0: this time It's like well, wow, there's the rules and they're crazy.

208
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:40,431
Speaker 0: So I don't know does not bode well Of course in the end.

209
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:43,488
Speaker 1: I'm not really worried because Katsucon is a not a con.

210
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:45,657
Speaker 1: I have gone to for the artist alley ever.

211
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,367
Speaker 0: Yeah I wasn't I had.

212
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:53,400
Speaker 0: no I've never been to katsucon yet But I did not imagine that it's artist alley would be among the greatest.

213
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:00,563
Speaker 1: I'll be perfectly honest in that Otacon really has the only artist alley I've ever been impressed by All right.

214
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:02,811
Speaker 1: I mean most most cons.

215
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:10,359
Speaker 1: we go to have a tiny artist alley like maybe 15 tables and often there's not much there or even worse.

216
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:21,040
Speaker 1: We went to a whole bunch of cons this summer and I saw the same group of people at all these cons Filling the artist alley like I'd already seen all this person's art and they're at every con I go to and that's that

217
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:21,682
Speaker 0: Yep,

218
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,451
Speaker 1: and Otacon just is such an amazing artist alley.

219
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:24,852
Speaker 1: I don't know.

220
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:27,220
Speaker 1: I don't even bother really to go through them.

221
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:28,171
Speaker 0: I think it's.

222
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:32,271
Speaker 0: I think what it is Is that there are artists alley people who go to every artist alley.

223
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,434
Speaker 0: they can get into.

224
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,240
Speaker 0: that's close enough to their location.

225
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:49,660
Speaker 0: And then when you have a big con you see the artist alley people from places far away from where you are Because it's a bigger artist alley It's a bigger draw and you also get people who they're too good to show up at a tiny little artist alley.

226
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:50,958
Speaker 0: They only show up for the big ones.

227
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:57,596
Speaker 0: You know It's like if you had an artist alley big enough like that comic cat thing in Japan You could freaking get everyone in the whole country to show up.

228
00:17:57,657 --> 00:18:06,029
Speaker 0: It's crazy Things of the day.

229
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:12,095
Speaker 1: Oh shit now I've been using a lot of videos lately and I got to say that this is one of my.

230
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:13,420
Speaker 0: you didn't use a video yesterday.

231
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:23,019
Speaker 1: No, I didn't but in general I've been using a lot of videos a lot of things on dig Or things that end up on dig in the time between when I find them and when I decide to use them.

232
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,889
Speaker 1: Today, however, I'm doing something very special.

233
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,848
Speaker 1: I found a video of Iron Man Acting stuff out in the real world.

234
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,252
Speaker 1: Iron Man is the man.

235
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:34,580
Speaker 0: Wait, you mean Iron Man the Marvel superhero.

236
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,445
Speaker 1: Oh, oh the underwear pervert.

237
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:36,927
Speaker 1: Yeah.

238
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:37,829
Speaker 1: No, not really.

239
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,050
Speaker 1: No.

240
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,474
Speaker 0: Okay good cuz I hate that Iron Man.

241
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:41,400
Speaker 1: Not if why do you hate Iron Man?

242
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,366
Speaker 0: I just don't like Iron Man.

243
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,520
Speaker 1: What his power is just he's made of iron.

244
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,403
Speaker 0: No, he's not.

245
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,789
Speaker 0: He's a guy in an iron suit.

246
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:51,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so effectively the power is made of iron.

247
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:52,985
Speaker 0: No, I just don't like Iron Man.

248
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:53,467
Speaker 0: I never liked.

249
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:54,811
Speaker 0: I don't know.

250
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:55,513
Speaker 0: I just never did.

251
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,439
Speaker 1: All right, I don't like spider-man.

252
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,185
Speaker 1: I'll be perfectly honest.

253
00:18:59,305 --> 00:18:59,787
Speaker 0: That's fine.

254
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:04,140
Speaker 1: But now I call it Iron Man only because that is the name of the video.

255
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:10,663
Speaker 1: It is in fact a man in a suit of armor that is probably made out of steel and not iron Mm-hmm.

256
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,858
Speaker 0: now steel is part iron.

257
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:17,440
Speaker 1: It's not cold wrought iron that he is wearing.

258
00:19:18,851 --> 00:19:25,749
Speaker 1: Yes Anyway I've been using a lot of practical jokes lately too.

259
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:33,549
Speaker 1: And I got to say that this is not as good as the Guy But it's up there.

260
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,780
Speaker 0: You mean the skeleton on the motorcycle?

261
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,675
Speaker 1: Yeah because they put this guy this little guy in his little suit of armor and you can't tell.

262
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:45,440
Speaker 1: there's a person in it and he Stands there in a museum like he's just some piece of armor on display.

263
00:19:45,982 --> 00:20:02,576
Speaker 1: so people walk up and they're looking at him one guy's filming him and he moves a little bit and the guy like he's sitting there looking through the camera and he backs up and has this puzzle look and he takes the camera away and he's like looking At the thing and looking in the camera and it's not moving now and he's trying to figure out.

264
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:05,999
Speaker 1: he thinks he's going insane And then it moves again and he about loses it runs out of the room.

265
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:11,119
Speaker 0: It's pretty good and of course, there's always the one person who goes ha ha ha ha ha ha.

266
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,359
Speaker 0: You fooled me instead of running away like I was.

267
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:25,460
Speaker 1: But what makes it funny for me is the way the guy in the armor moves because he must not know how to wear armor Very well, and also the armor is probably not very comfortable because he moves very oddly.

268
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:31,180
Speaker 1: And I think a video of a guy that guy walking around in that armor would be almost as funny as the practical joke itself.

269
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:33,007
Speaker 0: I think you might be correct.

270
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:34,272
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

271
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:40,312
Speaker 0: Okay, I actually do a lot of research About this thing today because I couldn't comprehend it when I read the original story.

272
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,820
Speaker 0: So, you know Second Life, right?

273
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:44,644
Speaker 1: I'm aware of it.

274
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:48,820
Speaker 0: Okay, Second Life is sort of like an MMO except there's no actual game.

275
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:52,600
Speaker 0: It's just this big world that you walk around in and do almost whatever you want.

276
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:59,253
Speaker 1: If you ever read The Escapist, you might be under the impression that everyone in the world But you play Second Life and it's the best game ever made.

277
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:06,615
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, yes Second Life you make an avatar you walk around you talk to people.

278
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:07,257
Speaker 0: you do things.

279
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:16,240
Speaker 0: now in Second Life Some things you want to do usually getting land or getting objects from other people requires money called Linden dollars.

280
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:22,880
Speaker 0: To get Linden dollars you give the company that runs Second Life your real dollars.

281
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,820
Speaker 0: They convert it and I think this is an exchange rate.

282
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,600
Speaker 0: But I know the exchange rate is to Linden dollars and then you can use those Linden dollars in the game to do stuff.

283
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:36,200
Speaker 0: You can also convert Linden dollars back into real money.

284
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:47,020
Speaker 0: So if you do things in Second Life and people give you their Linden dollars You can turn those into real dollars and you could run a business as in Second Life.

285
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:52,068
Speaker 0: And that's basically how Second Life the company You know the that runs it makes.

286
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:57,852
Speaker 0: Linden Labs makes their money is because they don't have to create game Content because they basically hire you to do it.

287
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:04,274
Speaker 0: and the more game content you create The more other players will give you Linden dollars and then the more regular dollars you get.

288
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:06,580
Speaker 1: I really like the concept of Second Life.

289
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:10,754
Speaker 1: It's just the game itself doesn't look like I would find it interesting.

290
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,239
Speaker 0: I've never actually gone into it.

291
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,450
Speaker 0: I've seen I've seen screenshots and I read about it on the internet.

292
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, there is a person in the game.

293
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,493
Speaker 0: They are known as Anshay Chung and apparently they're famous and they run.

294
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,800
Speaker 0: their avatar was on the cover of Newsweek and stuff.

295
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,161
Speaker 0: What?

296
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:26,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

297
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:27,310
Speaker 0: I didn't know about this.

298
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,940
Speaker 0: The real name of this person is Aylin Grafe.

299
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:31,387
Speaker 0: I don't know if I said that right.

300
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:33,377
Speaker 0: I don't even know if I said the name of their avatar, right?

301
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:34,000
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

302
00:22:34,602 --> 00:22:35,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll preachy.

303
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:39,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, this person started with ten bucks in Linden dollars.

304
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:43,980
Speaker 0: Well, originally they had a business, you know farming in games like Asheron's Call.

305
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:51,140
Speaker 0: Then they went into Second Life and they bought ten dollars worth of Linden dollars and they started selling shit in Second Life.

306
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:57,900
Speaker 0: And now this person has a million dollars real dollars Wow from doing Second Life business.

307
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:09,020
Speaker 0: Basically, they were just really opportunistic and like when there was a new game feature I think the game feature they mentioned was like your characters able to do like different poses and like, you know movements.

308
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:17,040
Speaker 0: They started selling people like all these custom movements as soon as that became a new feature And thus they were able to make a lot of money anyway.

309
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:24,777
Speaker 0: in Second Life This famous Second Life millionaire was going to do an interview with CNET.

310
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:30,557
Speaker 0: in Second Life The CNET reporter was was Greeter Dan Godell, whatever.

311
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,469
Speaker 0: now Here's where the thing of the day comes in.

312
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:40,400
Speaker 0: they go to this, you know in Second Life There's some building the CNET building and the CNET guy shows up, you know.

313
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:50,864
Speaker 0: and then people show up to listen to this interview and then the famous person shows up and then lo and behold I Can't count them.

314
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:56,723
Speaker 0: hundreds maybe thousands of rubber phalluses Are.

315
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:58,451
Speaker 0: just just look at these.

316
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:58,933
Speaker 0: look at these.

317
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:03,918
Speaker 0: good God It's just they just start raining from the sky at this interview.

318
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:04,360
Speaker 1: What is this?

319
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,415
Speaker 1: It's like Dominion tank police when they release the ultimate weapon.

320
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:11,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, so The famous person runs away.

321
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,100
Speaker 0: the CNET guy can't keep it under control.

322
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:23,340
Speaker 0: And before you know it there are these two monsters like literally monsters sitting in the interview chairs And it's basically some group called room 101 that goes around.

323
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:28,358
Speaker 0: This is the equivalent of griefing in Second Life because you can't grief really in a game where you can't.

324
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:28,860
Speaker 0: you know.

325
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,460
Speaker 0: There's no fighting or anything, you know, but this is griefing.

326
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,398
Speaker 0: Someone was trying to do an interview in Second Life and you ruined it by filling the room with penises.

327
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,137
Speaker 1: now I think my opinion of this is that it is awesome.

328
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,165
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean in other MMOs.

329
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:54,260
Speaker 0: while I think playing a lot of those standard MMOs is dumb in the first place Griefing is even more dumb and a game designed in such a way that allows griefing to even happen is bad design.

330
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,136
Speaker 0: However, this isn't really a game.

331
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:58,138
Speaker 0: It's just sort of this virtual world.

332
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:04,940
Speaker 0: So anything that increases entropy in a humorous way, especially humorous for people who aren't playing is awesome.

333
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:12,597
Speaker 0: The best thing to ever come out of World of Warcraft was Leroy Jenkins And as far as I'm concerned the best thing to ever come out of Second Life was a rain of penises.

334
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,215
Speaker 1: Well The evidence just keeps stacking up Scott.

335
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:16,840
Speaker 0: It sure does.

336
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:31,520
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think the issue there is simply that a lot of other MMOs You can do things in game or you can do things by coordinating out of game That the game designers decide they don't want you doing even though the game allows you to do it.

337
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:35,619
Speaker 1: So they'll punish you in game or out of game for the things you've done.

338
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:37,991
Speaker 1: Second Life doesn't really do that so much.

339
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,900
Speaker 1: the system works internal to itself.

340
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:44,513
Speaker 1: If you cause trouble people do things to you and your reputation gets hurt in a real way.

341
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:50,860
Speaker 1: and the actual people running the game Don't seem to take external punitive action on any regular basis.

342
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:56,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't seem like these guys got in trouble or anything About over what they've done.

343
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:58,720
Speaker 1: I mean if anything seen that just needs better security.

344
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got it.

345
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:06,109
Speaker 0: If you have a building in Second Life and you're doing stuff in it and you don't want Penises to come flying at you.

346
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:10,770
Speaker 0: You better build big walls on it Which might cost you some extra linen dollars.

347
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:20,780
Speaker 0: for you know, the penis eliminator Some sort of penis screen, you know if they were really cool What they could have done is you can just make stuff in Second Life, right?

348
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:25,232
Speaker 0: I don't know enough about it But I imagine you know from what I've been told you just make stuff.

349
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:38,688
Speaker 0: so I would have had you know If someone attacked me with penises, I would just sit down and code and model an anti penis automatic turret and And then I would just start popping them out.

350
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,767
Speaker 1: This is an arms race with dangerous dangerous Possibilities I know but think about it.

351
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:57,279
Speaker 1: you were thinking that you will design a device your sole purpose to seek out and destroy penises Mm-hmm, except my own, okay Okay Don't ever try to do that in the real world.

352
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:08,754
Speaker 1: Oh bad idea, even if someone makes some sort of penis replicator and starts filling houses with them All right, all right, so this week we haven't really talked about specific.

353
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:10,860
Speaker 0: we didn't talk about a specific game yesterday.

354
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:13,670
Speaker 0: We didn't really talk about specific technology on Monday.

355
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,220
Speaker 0: We'd sort of had topics that were more general.

356
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,951
Speaker 0: So today we're not gonna talk about an anime a manga or a comic.

357
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,100
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk about dubs in general.

358
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna talk about specific studios.

359
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,700
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk much about specific examples.

360
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:30,900
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about specific voice actors or anything.

361
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,760
Speaker 1: We're just the idea of dubs and how they affect us and how we feel about them.

362
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,377
Speaker 0: Well for anyone who might be completely stupid a dub is when you take a show that is in.

363
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:46,559
Speaker 0: well Technically a dub is when you have some video and you put audio on it.

364
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:56,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you're talking about anime you're talking about Hey, the original audio for this TV show was Japanese people talking.

365
00:27:56,421 --> 00:28:03,360
Speaker 0: We're gonna erase the Japanese talking and put in English talking and we need to get some English-speaking people to do that talking.

366
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:04,326
Speaker 0: And that is a dove.

367
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:18,412
Speaker 1: now all factors aside Probably the most annoying thing when it comes to dubs is simply the fact that among the anime community There's this whole dubs versus subs like made-up war.

368
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:21,660
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't even realize that this war was going on.

369
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,732
Speaker 0: I mean when I was in my first discovered anime, you know And I knew it was anime and like high school or whatever.

370
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:31,239
Speaker 0: I was watching on sci-fi channel Everything was dubbed, you know.

371
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,200
Speaker 0: And I knew intellectually on some level that this was a Japanese thing.

372
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:43,126
Speaker 0: And if I would have thought about it for a minute, I would have said hey, wait a minute That's not the original voices.

373
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:46,114
Speaker 0: There must have been Japanese voices something something.

374
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,240
Speaker 0: but that never actually occurred to me.

375
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:57,418
Speaker 0: I just kind of accepted the dub track and didn't think about it until I went to college Where it was apparently a big issue that was forced upon me.

376
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:06,159
Speaker 1: Yep I mean when we ran the RIT anime club Like we showed subs as a matter of course partly because attached to RIT is the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.

377
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:10,800
Speaker 1: So as kind of a way to be nice, we just always showed subtitled anime.

378
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could have showed the anime with an English dub and also the subtitles or closed captioning.

379
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,199
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but it was easier to just show a sub.

380
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:26,364
Speaker 1: So yeah by doing that we accommodated the deaf community and we actually had a good number of deaf members of the club and everyone Was happy.

381
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:28,640
Speaker 0: it was basically before DVDs.

382
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:33,601
Speaker 0: It was extremely more convenient because you couldn't really get the closed captioning to work So well.

383
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:38,656
Speaker 0: with the VHS God and the subtitled VHS you had a Japanese audio track.

384
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,987
Speaker 0: when the DVDs came around We had more options, but it didn't care.

385
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:42,951
Speaker 1: Well, see here's the problem.

386
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,259
Speaker 1: So once DVDs came around we want to show a DVD.

387
00:29:46,922 --> 00:29:50,284
Speaker 1: Several times we decided hey, this is a good dub Why don't we just show it dubbed?

388
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:55,060
Speaker 1: and the club would immediately split into equal and angry portions.

389
00:29:55,602 --> 00:30:08,638
Speaker 1: One half would demand that we show the dub because they hated reading subtitles and couldn't keep up with them and the other half Refused to come if we showed a dub because they think that all dubs are terrible and they have some sort of Ideological aversion to dubbed anime.

390
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:12,832
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, we stayed with the status quo because of the sub because that's what we had.

391
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:13,895
Speaker 0: not always.

392
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:16,089
Speaker 0: we showed it did a couple of Times.

393
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:17,885
Speaker 0: yeah Not often though and

394
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:32,893
Speaker 1: I will note that the reason this whole thing is stupid these people who care so much about this Was simply that one time we were gonna show Hellsing and we decided that we were gonna show it dubbed and People bitched and bitched and bitched when we announced it the day of like.

395
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:35,928
Speaker 1: we're about to show Hellsing like by the way It's gonna be dubbed.

396
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,800
Speaker 1: then the lights turn off and there's not for art.

397
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,196
Speaker 1: Everyone's yelling back and forth and people like well, I'm just gonna leave.

398
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:42,000
Speaker 1: This is crap.

399
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:57,075
Speaker 1: I don't want to watch some stupid dub and they all stayed anyway And they all watch the show and at the end a lot of people noted that the dub was pretty good And they enjoyed it and after about 30 seconds worth of watching the show after the opener ended.

400
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:58,840
Speaker 1: They stopped complaining entirely.

401
00:30:59,343 --> 00:31:01,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean before I got there to college.

402
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:12,937
Speaker 0: Like I said, it was a non-issue that as soon as I got there It was the biggest issue in the universe, you know People made all those usual arguments in favor of subtitles like ah, it's not the original you're losing so much.

403
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:15,733
Speaker 0: It's not You've destroyed the work of art.

404
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:18,165
Speaker 0: It's now something else Not what the original was.

405
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:22,200
Speaker 0: and you know, the voice acting is always terrible blabbity blabbity blah.

406
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:27,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't look at the characters and what's going on if you're always looking at subtitles.

407
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:30,219
Speaker 0: But all those arguments don't seem to matter now.

408
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,534
Speaker 0: So I it kind of weird to think back that they mattered then and now.

409
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:39,559
Speaker 1: who cares well see to me I hate to say it but well early on I mean dubs and subs.

410
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,730
Speaker 1: my Relationship with them has changed a lot over the years.

411
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:49,139
Speaker 1: when it started when I first watched anime I only saw dubs and then I started getting anime and I got a lot of subs for various reasons.

412
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:56,500
Speaker 1: and I had trouble watching the subs early on because the Japanese language and the way it's spoken is not like English.

413
00:31:56,962 --> 00:32:00,940
Speaker 1: So you couldn't really glean a lot of the emotional content.

414
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:10,383
Speaker 1: I didn't know what sarcasm sounded like in Japanese or the difference between someone who's happy or someone who's faking being happy or anything like that and The language.

415
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,354
Speaker 1: you sounded strange and alien and foreign to me.

416
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:13,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

417
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,329
Speaker 0: I remember like the first one or two times I watched a sub.

418
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:23,793
Speaker 0: it was kind of just weird and novel in itself to hear So much Japanese being spoken more than I'd ever heard at one time before.

419
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:30,000
Speaker 0: but eventually it was just oh All right, I could just do it and now I still can just watch him.

420
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,440
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is then as I watch more and more subs I started to get it.

421
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,040
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously I didn't learn the language.

422
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,095
Speaker 1: I still don't know the language but you start to.

423
00:32:39,155 --> 00:33:02,050
Speaker 1: if you watch enough Subtitled media now not just anime but anything subtitled in a specific language Even if you never learn the language other than random words, you'll start to pick up on general emotional cues or just all the things that all the subtext and all the things that let you understand the Subtle nature of the language without knowing the actual details of what's being said.

424
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:09,026
Speaker 1: so you can watch an anime in Japanese with subtitles But yet you get all of that Sarcasm.

425
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:10,860
Speaker 1: I just keep using sarcasm as an example.

426
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:13,851
Speaker 1: Yeah because you've listened to enough of it to be able to pick those things out.

427
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:20,380
Speaker 1: you get a sense of the language and I think A lot of people who are opposed to watching subtitled things just haven't watched enough subtitled things.

428
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:31,148
Speaker 0: That is something else that before I had ever watched a subtitled show Well, at least the subtitle anime had watched plenty of subtitled things, you know I didn't really you know prefer either way.

429
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:37,866
Speaker 0: then after I watched a bunch of subtitled things and I was able to you know Get the full subtitled effect.

430
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,917
Speaker 0: then when I watched a dub I freakin noticed how it was different.

431
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:50,579
Speaker 0: it was like oh, oh Yeah, it's like a problem that doesn't expose itself until you've seen the solution elsewhere.

432
00:33:53,022 --> 00:34:00,746
Speaker 1: Plus there was the issue back in the day that isn't a matter now where dubs cost less than subs on VHS simply because they knew

433
00:34:00,766 --> 00:34:01,488
Speaker 0: that

434
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:10,380
Speaker 1: people who wanted a sub would pay the extra money no matter what because they didn't want to listen To the dub and people who didn't care we're gonna buy the dub anyway.

435
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,592
Speaker 1: So they basically just extorted extra money out of the fans who wanted a subtitled version.

436
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:21,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they also printed a lot fewer subtitled VHS tapes.

437
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:28,224
Speaker 1: so lower supply higher price even though at the local Suncoast where I bought much of my anime back in the day Way back in the day.

438
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,940
Speaker 1: They had almost all subtitled anime and the only dub they had was Ranma.

439
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,426
Speaker 0: Well, that was a Suncoast.

440
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:36,940
Speaker 0: if you went to I don't know somewhere else there wasn't anywhere else.

441
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:43,630
Speaker 1: there was blockbuster where I could watch Armageddon and Do Megalopolis over and over again if I wanted.

442
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,536
Speaker 0: yeah, we didn't even have a Suncoast.

443
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:46,199
Speaker 1: really.

444
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was where I bought all my anime even though I remember paying like a hundred and eighty bucks for a VHS subtitled box set.

445
00:34:53,521 --> 00:35:01,767
Speaker 0: And I didn't even realize anime could be bought legally in a store until like freshman year Because I never bought any of it.

446
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:07,609
Speaker 0: and then someone had like a Trigun DVD and I was like, that's a DVD It's not a like a tape from Japan or anything.

447
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,516
Speaker 0: Hold I could just buy that at the media play.

448
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:14,939
Speaker 1: Holy shit It was amazing that I remember buying Tenchi Muyo the original OAV.

449
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,851
Speaker 1: Half of them were subs and half of them were dubs just because.

450
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:24,940
Speaker 1: and I bought him over the course of months because I couldn't Afford to buy it all at once because it was like 30 bucks of tape.

451
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:30,977
Speaker 1: Well, but yeah I mean when I first saw anime and dubs seemed like vampire hunter.

452
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:46,879
Speaker 1: D was awesome and I didn't even think about it and I watched subs and I realized that the subs seemed to be a lot better and the More I started to get the nuances the Japanese language the more I like the subs mostly because the the sad fact Is that most dubs are actually really piss-poor?

453
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:58,110
Speaker 0: Well, you know a lot of people say this and it's absolutely true is that you can be in another room and you can just be listening to whatever is on the television and it within.

454
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:03,508
Speaker 0: you don't even have to hear a single word and you can tell if That's an anime dub on in the other room.

455
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:03,970
Speaker 1: Yep.

456
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,894
Speaker 1: We've tried this.

457
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:06,400
Speaker 1: we've tested this in numerous.

458
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:13,203
Speaker 0: okay, like you could just have someone like with a bunch of like five second mp3s and one of them contains like Godzilla.

459
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:19,066
Speaker 0: one of them contains who knows and you just play one of them and Someone will say anime dub not anime dub.

460
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,229
Speaker 0: anime dub not anime dub.

461
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:22,435
Speaker 0: They have this distinct sound to them.

462
00:36:22,535 --> 00:36:24,742
Speaker 0: That's I Don't know.

463
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,669
Speaker 0: It's generally unpleasant.

464
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but seems to carry across to a lot of cartoons, too.

465
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,388
Speaker 1: I mean in general you can always tell between Cartoon live-action without seeing the screen.

466
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,577
Speaker 1: Mmm with the possible exception of cowboy bebop.

467
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:41,920
Speaker 0: Well, yeah But that's the thing is that dubbing doesn't have to be bad.

468
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,745
Speaker 0: I mean it usually is worse than subtitles in most cases But it doesn't have to be.

469
00:36:48,127 --> 00:37:00,805
Speaker 0: it's very possible for dubs to be as good as or better than the original Japanese audio track because a lot of times Japanese has shitty voice actors too in the original so you can beat them out with Yeah, better English voice act.

470
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:11,469
Speaker 1: I mean it might be do partly or possibly wholly to nostalgia But I have watched eros a otzara to beautiful dreamer Probably 20 times in my life if not more.

471
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:22,723
Speaker 1: it's my favorite movie hands down and despite that I I've seen it subbed and dubbed but I prefer the dub to this day Despite known Inaccuracies in it.

472
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:34,318
Speaker 1: there are absolute inaccuracies that I've noticed that I have researched and that I just I don't worry about Because I think the dub is hilarious and I find the some of the voice acting on the sub to be annoying.

473
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:40,480
Speaker 1: and this is Even now after I've gotten enough of an ear to kind of know what good Japanese voice acting sounds like.

474
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,669
Speaker 0: Well, I think that has it.

475
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:43,120
Speaker 0: that is a lot due to nostalgia.

476
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,199
Speaker 0: I mean on the weekly anime review he played a short clip from the old Akira dub, right?

477
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,902
Speaker 0: Oh Right.

478
00:37:49,962 --> 00:37:57,836
Speaker 0: So the really old Akira dub not the newer one because there are two Akira dubs And I listened to it and it was like this sledgehammer.

479
00:37:57,896 --> 00:38:01,308
Speaker 0: That was half Nostalgia and half good God.

480
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:02,030
Speaker 0: is that terrible?

481
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,635
Speaker 1: It's like watching Robotech again.

482
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,280
Speaker 0: It's like oh, it's like well Robotech's night.

483
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,245
Speaker 0: It's like watching he-man.

484
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:07,873
Speaker 0: It's like oh, there's he-man.

485
00:38:08,074 --> 00:38:15,080
Speaker 0: Oh, it's bad You know and it's like I had this strong feeling for it combined with a strong feeling against it.

486
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:19,960
Speaker 0: But it's a part of me god damn it and it's pretty terrible.

487
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:27,700
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't want to give any disrespect to American anime voice actors But I just don't understand how dubs can be the way they are.

488
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:35,040
Speaker 1: It seems like they go through Errors were like if you listen to anime back in the day like Slayer like the era when slayers was really popular in the u.s.

489
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:37,047
Speaker 1: All the dubs kind of sound the same.

490
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:43,238
Speaker 1: and now listen to anime today all the dubs kind of sound the same But they don't sound the same as the dubs from before.

491
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:45,679
Speaker 1: in fact I'd say that a lot of them are in some ways worse.

492
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:55,680
Speaker 0: Well, I think actually I give the voice actors credit because and I'm not gonna go into great detail on how the dubs are Made and all that jazz, but yeah, I got a rant about how dubs are made.

493
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:06,600
Speaker 0: I get the impression that a lot some of the dubs they do put a lot of time and effort into and they spend a Lot of money to make sure they're awesome, but most of them they try to hack them out.

494
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:14,771
Speaker 0: You know just do a serviceable job and back in the day when they would do that for martial arts movies You would get what you would expect something.

495
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:15,475
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

496
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:15,535
Speaker 0: Oh?

497
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,790
Speaker 0: You would get you know go out your Bruce Lee movies original dub.

498
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,533
Speaker 0: It's just ass.

499
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:22,220
Speaker 0: It's it's completely useless.

500
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:35,341
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think what's actually going on is that most and you know not the big-time anime But most of the anime they're putting as much time and effort and money into the dubs as they did into those bad Bruce Lee Dubs.

501
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:47,940
Speaker 0: yet the product while still not satisfactory to us fans To us crazy fans You know it's a lot better than what you would normally get putting in that amount of time and effort and work.

502
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,208
Speaker 0: So I do think that they are.

503
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:53,580
Speaker 0: you know they're doing the best job that they can under the circumstances.

504
00:39:54,164 --> 00:39:56,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I don't think it's the voice actors fault.

505
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,200
Speaker 1: I think that it's the direction that they get and to an extent sometimes the writing done by the translators.

506
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,080
Speaker 0: Well, and it's also the anime companies for not trying to make their dubs awesome.

507
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:17,813
Speaker 0: They're just trying to get the dub done like it's their job instead of trying to do good art On the dub you know trying to make a good one And I think a lot of it would have to do though things are.

508
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,914
Speaker 1: I hope things are changing But a lot of older dubs.

509
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:26,402
Speaker 1: I know in America The philosophy was totally different and in Japan a lot of times They were dubbing a show.

510
00:40:26,462 --> 00:40:37,301
Speaker 1: they'd have a whole bunch of people like all the actors from a scene in One room or in saw just doing all the acting playing off of each other in real time and record the whole thing in one Shot.

511
00:40:37,762 --> 00:40:44,280
Speaker 1: where in America a lot of times they would tend to record each individual voice actors lines by themselves.

512
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,439
Speaker 1: they'd basically be playing off of nothing or off of the recording that the other person already made.

513
00:40:49,459 --> 00:41:01,140
Speaker 1: and Because it seems like a lot of dubs in America either Lack energy entirely like there's no energy or flow to them or they have this super like tacked on fake energy.

514
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:02,828
Speaker 1: That gets to the point.

515
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:03,874
Speaker 1: We're just so annoying.

516
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:04,759
Speaker 1: I can't listen to it.

517
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:10,985
Speaker 0: The emotions definitely aren't natural and they don't seem to match up between Characters and scenes.

518
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:17,480
Speaker 1: very well also, and I say this to this day, and I'm not sure I mean I'd have to I couldn't come up with a lot of examples.

519
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:24,260
Speaker 1: But it seems like there are things or concepts that you can put forth or get across or say in Japanese.

520
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:28,574
Speaker 1: That don't sound cheesy in Japanese because it's the kind of thing people would say.

521
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:41,300
Speaker 1: but yet if you say those things Translated literally into English or not even literally But even just the meaning behind them to our American Western ears They sound really lame or cheesy because people just don't say things like that.

522
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:47,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is actually more of an issue in manga adaptations, but it's still an issue in Anime, is that?

523
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:49,260
Speaker 0: well big complaint of dubs?

524
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,936
Speaker 0: I remember from freshman year when they you know all those crazy sub Nazis.

525
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:57,653
Speaker 0: they would say Oh the dub isn't the original meaning they change it.

526
00:41:57,713 --> 00:41:58,416
Speaker 0: It's not what was?

527
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:03,290
Speaker 0: you know, you're losing something Not a direct translation and then you know it.

528
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,720
Speaker 0: later I realized wait a minute you can't directly translate.

529
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,824
Speaker 0: It's not possible.

530
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,640
Speaker 0: Sometimes, you know if they tell some Japanese, you know.

531
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:12,382
Speaker 0: And like.

532
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:18,951
Speaker 0: if someone says in America like, you know, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush How do you translate the jet?

533
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:19,820
Speaker 0: That's a Japanese?

534
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,533
Speaker 1: Well, you say a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

535
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:24,979
Speaker 1: you translated literally no one.

536
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:27,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, they might not understand what the hell does that mean?

537
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,192
Speaker 0: You have to come up with the equivalent Japanese, you know thing It's sort of like or you leave it in and let people learn about it.

538
00:42:35,015 --> 00:42:36,040
Speaker 0: It depends on the show.

539
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does like irresponsible captain Tyler.

540
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:41,740
Speaker 1: You could not do that because those puns were just out there.

541
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:43,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, like as among a dial.

542
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:48,395
Speaker 0: It's kind of way out there and actually I was among it as a good example for this whole thing.

543
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:52,140
Speaker 0: because in that show You could go on either road.

544
00:42:52,260 --> 00:43:13,300
Speaker 0: You could either choose to leave everything in there literally and then use the show to teach the American audience about all this weird Japanese puns and jokes and you know all this like monzai comedy stuff going on or you could take it out and You know just translate it into something that makes sense in English and either way it works.

545
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,456
Speaker 0: It's just a decision you have to make in the beginning.

546
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:20,782
Speaker 1: Yep I mean, I guess if if a dub is done well, like if a show is dubbed really well It's done.

547
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:25,320
Speaker 1: Well, then I consider the sub and dub to be equal because there are two very different things.

548
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:42,533
Speaker 1: now the sub is the original Japanese voice acting with a very literal translation of what they're saying underneath because the subtitle now if you're subtitling something doesn't need to be Eloquent spoken it just needs to convey all the information that the person is saying.

549
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:48,839
Speaker 1: so you can have a very novelized style very literal very direct translation of what they're saying.

550
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:53,599
Speaker 1: and Even if the phrasing is a little awkward It doesn't matter because you're reading it while you listen to them talk.

551
00:43:54,042 --> 00:44:00,063
Speaker 1: But in a dub, they definitely have to change it a lot more to make it come across naturally But they also.

552
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:06,100
Speaker 0: another thing dubs all seem to do is they they seem more concerned with matching the characters lips.

553
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:07,376
Speaker 0: Then I think they should be.

554
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:10,169
Speaker 1: yeah I remember I saw a thing a long time ago.

555
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:13,260
Speaker 1: someone demonstrated at some con and it was actually.

556
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,614
Speaker 1: no I wasn't Ohio con it was might have been a concert kind of wasn't that?

557
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:24,705
Speaker 1: I don't know when it was But I remember seeing a little short clip where it showed a dub and a sub and how the dub matched the voice Perfect like the lips perfectly.

558
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,791
Speaker 1: the person talking everything they said.

559
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:38,568
Speaker 1: every syllable matched what the mouth was doing in the anime but yet in the Japanese original it didn't match at all and the person kept talking for a full second after the Person's mouth stopped moving.

560
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,473
Speaker 1: and you know what.

561
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:40,840
Speaker 1: they were both fine.

562
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:44,054
Speaker 1: So why bother trying to match it up if it doesn't even matter?

563
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:50,232
Speaker 0: that is one thing I think that could be fixed with a lot of American dubs of anime right now.

564
00:44:50,373 --> 00:45:06,200
Speaker 0: is they do seem even when it's not Like a big-time production dub like I don't know cowboy bebop or ghost in the shell or anything like that when it's a smaller show and they're obviously not Spending a whole lot of time and money on this dub.

565
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:18,918
Speaker 0: They still try really hard to match those lips and they seem to make you know Sacrifices in other areas in order to achieve that and that's really not the thing you have to concentrate on the most.

566
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:26,500
Speaker 0: you should concentrate On having the dialogue be better to make the show as good as you possibly can and making the characters sound.

567
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:35,020
Speaker 1: Hmm, right Oh going back of it I just thought of a perfect example for my thing I was saying about awkward phrases or things that don't sound right to our Western ears.

568
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:39,560
Speaker 1: You know what a lot of times in anime someone will say something that translates to do your best.

569
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:42,087
Speaker 1: No one says that here.

570
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:44,855
Speaker 1: no one would ever yell that to anyone.

571
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:49,334
Speaker 1: they'd yell something like good luck Or don't go go.

572
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:53,350
Speaker 1: Whoo Exactly, but what do you do now?

573
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,040
Speaker 1: If you translate it literally then it sounds lame.

574
00:45:56,564 --> 00:46:01,591
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not lame the meanings there But it sounds lame if you translate it in a creative way.

575
00:46:01,952 --> 00:46:09,959
Speaker 1: the fans get mad because it wasn't a literal translation Mm-hmm, and they claim that you lose something when really Depending on the situation you don't lose anything.

576
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:12,972
Speaker 0: You don't lose anything as long as the writing is good.

577
00:46:13,132 --> 00:46:22,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the voice acting is good yep, but anyway part of the reason we did this show was that we didn't feel like reviewing anything and We're tired and the holidays are coming up.

578
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:25,196
Speaker 1: So I don't know what you can expect us to talk about tomorrow.

579
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,712
Speaker 0: I Don't freaking know at all.

580
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:28,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to bed.

604
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:45,938
Speaker 1: So if you like geek nights and you join our forums and you join this collective dig body You will have more of an influence on to internet unless you're lame and then no one will dig the things For the green flags with the star.

605
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:50,486
Speaker 0: Yes, and then let your mouse hover over them for a second So you can see who dug it.

606
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:59,750
Speaker 1: Yeah I will also note that some of our overzealous listeners seem to be going through the motions of digging every single episode of our show.

607
00:49:01,675 --> 00:49:06,527
Speaker 1: Okay I'll just ask you if you're gonna dig individual episodes of geek nights.

608
00:49:06,588 --> 00:49:07,010
Speaker 1: That's cool.

609
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:12,310
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say you shouldn't but only dig the ones that you think are above average are particularly good.

610
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:16,905
Speaker 1: Because if something someone digs every episode of geek nights, then that really defeats the purpose.

611
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:19,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever I don't care what the hell people do.

612
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:26,712
Speaker 0: I just use dig podcast so that we can get all these other podcast directories out of business because they're useless and they're terrible and They suck.

613
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:34,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then phase two is putting all these other podcasts out of business And then we're the only podcast in the world No one will care about podcasts anymore.
