Speaker 0: You made.

13
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:52,212
Speaker 1: it amazes me that when I was a little kid like I remember watching Logan's run and not Like.

14
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,862
Speaker 1: I took it completely seriously like kids take everything.

15
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:56,990
Speaker 0: I took it seriously that I like shit like that.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,284
Speaker 0: You know you know sort of eerie and quiet and long and a lot sort of like.

17
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:11,055
Speaker 1: you know get that atmosphere of ooh It's all weird sci-fi and this crazy shit out there, but I mean like I would take like project a co seriously At that same time in my life.

18
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:15,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe but I remember thankfully seriously.

19
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:21,749
Speaker 1: I remember Wanting to know what the deal was with Logan's run, but being too young to like really grasp it.

20
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:28,097
Speaker 1: So I watched it again in like the last five or six years And it's a pretty shit movie.

21
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:29,563
Speaker 1: I like it all things considered.

22
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:30,145
Speaker 0: I still like it.

23
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:31,610
Speaker 1: the thing is movies like that.

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,018
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's a great epic film of all greatness But I like a lot of the aspects.

25
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:45,569
Speaker 1: it just has the problem that a lot of those kinds of movies have where it's really Long, but independently the majority of the scenes don't actually move the plot in any meaningful way.

26
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:48,259
Speaker 1: well Yeah, and they really take a lot of like.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,641
Speaker 1: it's like.

28
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:54,144
Speaker 1: it's like bad cinema 101 like hey Let's take a gigantic detour to explore this part of the world.

29
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,811
Speaker 1: no one cares about That's.

30
00:01:55,892 --> 00:02:00,389
Speaker 1: I like zoom in on the doctor getting cut up because you all wanted to see that.

31
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:06,080
Speaker 1: yep But yeah, I'm gonna run because Yeah, my otaku expiration date.

32
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:08,068
Speaker 0: I don't understand right.

33
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,699
Speaker 0: It's like You can carousel or you can run.

34
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,141
Speaker 0: what happens?

35
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:11,684
Speaker 0: if you run?

36
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:12,589
Speaker 0: they shoot you.

37
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:15,950
Speaker 0: Well, you're dying either way, so you might as least have a chance.

38
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:20,121
Speaker 1: Scott you forget that carousel promises renewal.

39
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,670
Speaker 1: if you make it if you survive you are renewed.

40
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:31,079
Speaker 1: But if you run just like how in the running man if you get away you get that money And you're set for life.

41
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,370
Speaker 0: No one gets away in the running.

42
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,123
Speaker 1: Those two people got away Arnold.

43
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:38,559
Speaker 1: That's the only guy Arnold I really want to.

44
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:53,646
Speaker 1: I don't have the time or the energy to do it now But after we watch commando over the front row crew epic New Year's party I and Conan I Kind of want to take every Arnold movie and mash him up into another movie.

45
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,990
Speaker 0: a lot of people have done that already.

46
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:58,410
Speaker 1: I have not seen even one person who made a feature-length movie.

47
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,099
Speaker 1: That was nothing more than mashups of scenes from all.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,123
Speaker 1: this is internet.

49
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:02,785
Speaker 0: it exists.

50
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:05,718
Speaker 1: I'm doubtful After the show.

51
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,124
Speaker 0: so today, I went.

52
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:08,150
Speaker 0: there was a SOPA.

53
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:09,194
Speaker 0: I mean sure.

54
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,845
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone saw SOPA blackout protests on the Internet's.

55
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:17,122
Speaker 0: I went to the physical SOPA protests near the senator's office in 49th and 3rd, which I'm on 49th and 7th.

56
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,172
Speaker 0: So I just had to walk.

57
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:25,349
Speaker 1: I would have gone however one all the people protesting SOPA have jobs.

58
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,453
Speaker 0: well Yes, I just went.

59
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:27,800
Speaker 0: I didn't want to go there to protest.

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,204
Speaker 0: I just want to go there to see how it was going and There are a few things going on there.

61
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,333
Speaker 0: number one I buy.

62
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:37,117
Speaker 0: that's an area I bike past on the way to work often so I knew the area They basically had.

63
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:39,010
Speaker 0: there's an area with a wide sidewalk.

64
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,564
Speaker 0: they chopped half of it off and they took away the.

65
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:45,359
Speaker 0: you know the show the The parking spots in the street and that was the.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,650
Speaker 0: and they fenced it off with little metal brackets that the cops use.

67
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,298
Speaker 0: The cops are standing around lazily going yep.

68
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,121
Speaker 0: Yep.

69
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:52,342
Speaker 0: Yep.

70
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:56,683
Speaker 0: Yep, because all the protesters are just sort of quiet holding up Their signs because they're just normal people.

71
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,649
Speaker 0: They're not a crazy hippies.

72
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:05,070
Speaker 0: And They had was most interesting is you know, it's filled in like there were hundreds of people there packing into that thing.

73
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:05,909
Speaker 0: I was quite impressed.

74
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know the moral.

75
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:07,917
Speaker 1: don't fuck with the internet.

76
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:11,310
Speaker 0: a lot of people taking photos and such but the cops pretty much what?

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,030
Speaker 0: The cops did is they were like you either got to go in the fence or move along.

78
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,654
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to.

79
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,510
Speaker 0: they didn't let people loiter outside the fence, you know.

80
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,336
Speaker 0: So I was like we loitered for about 10 minutes outside the fence took some pictures walked around on my flicker and Then left and got lunch.

81
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:29,210
Speaker 0: because not going in the fence because that means you can't get out of the fence easily and what if you?

82
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:29,632
Speaker 0: Had to pee.

83
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I have to go back to work and it's cold and I want to eat lunch.

84
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like the internet protest is the real force, right?

85
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,355
Speaker 0: But one thing was at the very.

86
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,810
Speaker 0: it was basically sort of this long rectangle right at the very end.

87
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:49,755
Speaker 0: They had they had some guest speakers and and you know, whatever They had a microphone and a sound system and they got on the news crews to show up and I was like, whoa They got a sound system.

88
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:50,399
Speaker 0: That's impressive.

89
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,510
Speaker 0: So it's telling but I was looking at the sound system.

90
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,941
Speaker 0: It's like two speakers on tripods and a microphone and you know a box of equipment and I'm like There's no way anyone is gonna hear that.

91
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:01,599
Speaker 0: as soon as a truck comes by You're not gonna hear shit.

92
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,170
Speaker 0: and the traffic was relatively heavy.

93
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,554
Speaker 0: You know a constant like.

94
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,705
Speaker 0: you couldn't take a picture of it from across the street because there are so many cars.

95
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:13,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, and When they actually started talking you could fucking hear it was loud and clear.

96
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,972
Speaker 0: I was like, whoa, you know it's impressive.

97
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:20,250
Speaker 1: I've looked into those systems because there was a time when we would go to conventions that did not necessarily provide.

98
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:21,574
Speaker 0: So this is like.

99
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:31,564
Speaker 0: this was so good like New York City Street in the air with cars and trucks driving by Only two speakers and you could hear it loud and clear like one or two blocks away.

100
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,750
Speaker 0: That is a good system set up.

101
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:41,310
Speaker 1: Well interesting how this one-time kind of ad hoc not planned that far in advance protest was able to be so well organized.

102
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:45,907
Speaker 0: Well, they were like, you know, it was a meetup and it was the New York Tech meetup Which I don't want to talk about them now.

103
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,686
Speaker 0: Specific message and like the meetup people were there wearing little meetup aprons because they were so proud that meetup was used to get it Together and all kinds of.

104
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:59,310
Speaker 1: yeah I used to be a member of meetup and then I Dropped because I got all these kind of pointless.

105
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,492
Speaker 0: Well, pretty much any time you join a meetup they start emailing you see it to unsubscribe from each and every meetup and it's you Whatever.

106
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:06,054
Speaker 0: Yeah.

107
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:09,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, I sort of managed it by unsubscribing from everything.

108
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:14,306
Speaker 0: But yeah, I was impressed that that many people actually showed up.

109
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:17,722
Speaker 0: and you know If you look right, you know people have these short memories.

110
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:19,590
Speaker 0: It seems like everyone but us is a short memory.

111
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:26,010
Speaker 0: It's like we remember when he fought and lost against the DMCA and like that remember the CBD tPA, right?

112
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,275
Speaker 0: And then we fought and won against that and we fought in one against coaca and I think there were a couple others in there Too right.

113
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:38,609
Speaker 0: and it feels like every year every other year we had to fight off one of these things and won but we barely fought and won and shut down most of these things.

114
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:52,913
Speaker 0: and Now this one right it's just basically it's like people like oh watch out for a PIPA - or SOPA - it's like What do you mean, you know PIPA is just coaca CBD tPA for it's not right It's nice.

115
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:56,567
Speaker 1: over one CBD tPA was pretty much the worst one.

116
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:57,793
Speaker 1: Yeah, luckily We've never.

117
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:06,112
Speaker 1: that never got revisited because if it did You got nothing on these protests, but the point is is we got you know We're.

118
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,785
Speaker 0: it's going the other way that we're getting angrier and more people every time.

119
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,110
Speaker 0: the next time they try this.

120
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,055
Speaker 0: I got mad.

121
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:18,082
Speaker 0: the next time they try this shit like a year or two from now You're gonna see if there were a five hundred to a thousand people this time.

122
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:20,270
Speaker 0: This is gonna be two thousand next time.

123
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,455
Speaker 1: well, look at Next time.

124
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:33,010
Speaker 1: the opposite talking points now are basically things like oh so Obama and all these people are clearly just you know in the pocket of Silicon Valley and these big corporations.

125
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,537
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

126
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:38,380
Speaker 0: if they were in the pocket of Silicon Valley I would vote for them because you know what better at least.

127
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:42,010
Speaker 0: they'll be corrupt on my side as opposed to being corrupt on the other side.

128
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:43,633
Speaker 0: So check this out.

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,456
Speaker 0: and then at the bottom it says trade in any Manga volume number one.

149
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:59,590
Speaker 0: get any DC new 52 number one for free.

150
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:03,275
Speaker 0: So if you go to this a comic shop You can take any manga volume you have.

151
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:08,570
Speaker 0: that's number one trade it in and they'll give you one flimsy ass comic book for free.

152
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:13,130
Speaker 1: So is this just not an extension of the long-standing?

153
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,150
Speaker 1: Comic shop owners like weird anger and hatred over manga being popular.

154
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,664
Speaker 0: This is created a giant internet flame wars of awesome cars.

155
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:24,710
Speaker 0: and you know, there's so many aspects, right?

156
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,450
Speaker 0: It's basically there's the aspect of oh these people recognize that manga makes money, but they don't understand it.

157
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,470
Speaker 0: So they're right and they just want to make money off the shit.

158
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,090
Speaker 1: No, they just want to get a bunch of manga for cheap that they can then sell to make money.

159
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,515
Speaker 0: Well that too, you know, there's.

160
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:40,840
Speaker 0: there's so many aspects of this.

161
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,610
Speaker 0: you can't even you could spend all day going over them.

162
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,039
Speaker 0: But it's just like, you know, wow These comic shops they still don't get.

163
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,850
Speaker 0: they really don't get it and it's like doing something like this.

164
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:58,893
Speaker 0: It's like just you might as well just taking a giant roll of paper like in the olden days when you'd print a banner on your Apple - with two cakes at the end and Just right.

165
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:03,238
Speaker 0: We don't get it and hang it right up above your store But at the same time they might get it.

166
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:11,470
Speaker 1: if you look at this from this like if you assume that they're savvy Like if you try to pretend alright, these guys clearly have an angle and are intelligent.

167
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,172
Speaker 1: What could it be?

168
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:12,393
Speaker 1: which?

169
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:21,690
Speaker 1: funnily enough if you take that approach to a stupid person's, you know attempts at getting something they want You'll usually come up with pretty crazy motivations.

170
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,695
Speaker 1: that's the only way to make it sense, but with these people you could argue that they Don't care about.

171
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:29,921
Speaker 1: the people who read manga and the people have diverse interests.

172
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:32,790
Speaker 1: and the people who are interested in, you know visual media.

173
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:44,190
Speaker 1: They're catering to their base and their base is probably if comic shops I've been to in the last few years with the exceptions of cool ones like Bergen Street are to be any indication.

174
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,750
Speaker 1: Their base is a combination of people who buy every spider-man people who buy airsoft guns.

175
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,717
Speaker 0: You buy everything with Wolverine on the cover.

176
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think the airsoft guns are actually the majority of the market there.

177
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,886
Speaker 0: Alright, but it's sort of like on the one hand.

178
00:10:58,966 --> 00:10:59,610
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

179
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,550
Speaker 0: Are you trying to convert manga people to reading DC Comics?

180
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,493
Speaker 1: That's not gonna work.

181
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,945
Speaker 0: Are they gonna really come in and dump all their shitty manga?

182
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:06,929
Speaker 0: They never want to read again.

183
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,162
Speaker 0: Not likely right.

184
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,258
Speaker 0: number two Maybe there's all the regular comics guys.

185
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:21,990
Speaker 0: all of them have like a spare of manga volume around that they don't want You know, but it's like we have all the DC 52 number one issues and I wouldn't trade a manga volume for any of them.

186
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:24,294
Speaker 0: You should trade you if you know.

187
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:33,730
Speaker 0: if you did trade a manga volume one for a DC 52 trade number one volume That would be a fair trade and then this would be cool and no one would complain.

188
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,235
Speaker 1: I guess what's always fascinated me.

189
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:36,038
Speaker 1: Is this weird?

190
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:50,370
Speaker 0: if I had a comic shop, I would do trade any trade For I would do used for used one one-to-one trades because I would sell you stuff Straight up like GameStop did like a used bookstore does and I would say bring in a used book take a used book.

191
00:11:50,991 --> 00:12:02,568
Speaker 1: I guess I've just never understood the like the weird comic shop or a comic book fan like narrow nerd focus anger at A similar thing being popular among a different demographic.

192
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:03,914
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean why don't you know?

193
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:09,035
Speaker 0: it's always cool to see like there are comic shops that sort of get like you like Comicopia in Boston.

194
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,320
Speaker 0: It's like they load.

195
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,670
Speaker 0: They got some ladies there that understand the mangas.

196
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:16,685
Speaker 0: I mean not to say they load up on the mangas and the regular kind a little bit everything.

197
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:20,544
Speaker 1: not to say that the American Manga industry understood anything and you can see what they did.

198
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:28,730
Speaker 1: well, Tokyo pop Yeah, okay, but I just it amazes me that this sort of sentiment can still exist in the modern era.

199
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:29,854
Speaker 0: It's just.

200
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:30,919
Speaker 0: how do how come?

201
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,130
Speaker 0: no it seems like people who run companies.

202
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,910
Speaker 1: I mean do they think that people like us started reading manga?

203
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:44,990
Speaker 1: Because like we were bamboozled by some marketing And that they just have to trick us back in to remind us how much we love Green Lantern and all of his bullshit?

204
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,690
Speaker 1: Stop reading things like Green Lantern because I've always kind of hated stuff like that.

205
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,164
Speaker 0: It's just in general across all business in society, right?

206
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:54,610
Speaker 0: Especially nerd businesses.

207
00:12:55,112 --> 00:13:05,369
Speaker 0: Why is it that people who work for these companies their job 24/7 is to do this thing comics or comic shop right or whatever it is that they're doing movies.

208
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:05,770
Speaker 0: Who knows?

209
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,013
Speaker 0: They never get it.

210
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:08,617
Speaker 0: None of them.

211
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:11,150
Speaker 0: There isn't there hardly any of them that get it.

212
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:18,250
Speaker 0: it's like who only people get it are like the hot city Miku people and Valve right and it's like who else no one else gets it.

213
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,390
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, there's millions of nerds across the world and all of them get it.

214
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,826
Speaker 0: But no one who actually works for a company who has a job of doing it gets it.

215
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,928
Speaker 0: but people do it Just like in their spare time totally get it.

216
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,342
Speaker 0: Yeah, I look like look at the end or so anyone who gets it running.

217
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:36,473
Speaker 1: look at the enforcers at PAX who run like different Departments and everything.

218
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:46,370
Speaker 1: It's not like they're spending 40 hours a week planning that and yet go to a professionally run like real convention and It's you know, it's a different venue a different kind of event.

219
00:13:46,410 --> 00:14:00,150
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say that like the Board of Trade is gonna have an awesome convention with drinking and partying all night But they fail at the simple stuff like chairs showing up in time or speakers or microphones.

220
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,849
Speaker 0: I just don't know why but it's people whose job it is to do something?

221
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:06,860
Speaker 0: There's almost no.

222
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:13,750
Speaker 0: you could list on like a few hands Maybe even just one hand the companies that get it right and pretty much every other company gets it wrong.

223
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:18,130
Speaker 0: But if you go on the internet and just go to forums and stuff, we're just people doing shit for free.

224
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,610
Speaker 0: Everyone gets it right almost always.

225
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,841
Speaker 1: Comics thing there's there - there's a big Venn diagram.

226
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:27,007
Speaker 1: There's two demographics that are really involved here.

227
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:31,823
Speaker 1: There's the hardcore American superhero comic nerds not American comics.

228
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:33,350
Speaker 1: American superhero comics.

229
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,421
Speaker 1: They're the only demographic this ad is aimed at.

230
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:41,479
Speaker 1: the other demographic is the equal Pretty much identical mirror image of this.

231
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,082
Speaker 1: That is the.

232
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:48,723
Speaker 1: I am a fan of manga Because I like manga and the things that I perceive manga to be.

233
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:52,949
Speaker 1: I therefore hate American comics Which I perceive as being nothing but superhero comics.

234
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:57,682
Speaker 1: Those are the only two demographics involved in this entire internet flame war.

235
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,210
Speaker 1: Anyway, nobody else is involved or cares.

236
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:01,458
Speaker 0: it's still.

237
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:06,193
Speaker 0: it's sort of jingoistic and Ignorant.

238
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:06,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't.

239
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:09,624
Speaker 0: it doesn't reflect good on telling or DC.

240
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:14,233
Speaker 1: We bought all 52 of the new 52 Research purposes.

241
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:18,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna review them on the show and well we you and we should have done it already.

242
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,142
Speaker 0: They're already coming out with like number sixes.

243
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:26,066
Speaker 1: I think I gotta tell you I Expected a slog but I went in with an open mind and you know what some of them remember.

244
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:34,570
Speaker 1: our reviews were pretty good In fact, I liked a lot of them more than Scott did but at the same time It was such a slog to read them all and you know what?

245
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,521
Speaker 0: I was if you buy comics the other day, there are people who buy all.

246
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,990
Speaker 0: think about their people who buy that stack monthly.

247
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,625
Speaker 0: Those are monthly comics every month.

248
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:42,190
Speaker 0: They get this day.

249
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,837
Speaker 1: I was at Bergen Street comics the other day for the Johnny Wander like book thing, which was packed like Crazy small store, right?

250
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,583
Speaker 0: So even like a hundred people would pack it.

251
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was like.

252
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:56,844
Speaker 1: but yeah Of course, so I was there and there were a bunch of the 52 thing.

253
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,730
Speaker 1: issue four or five was up on the shelf.

254
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:06,203
Speaker 1: yeah, so I pick a couple up and The few comics I'd liked have devolved into the bullshit.

255
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,450
Speaker 1: That is exactly why I don't read that kind of comic.

256
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:09,252
Speaker 1: It was all.

257
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:15,711
Speaker 1: see issue 45 or see issue whatever of this where the blah blah blah disease was blah blah blah See.

258
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:18,099
Speaker 0: here's the thing right with those that produce.

259
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:28,390
Speaker 0: editor notes in particular are a topic of great debate Because if you put them in right then it's like well now if I want to know I know where to go.

260
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:33,090
Speaker 0: I don't have to go like hunt on the internet to figure out what the hell is going on because imagine that note isn't there.

261
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,137
Speaker 0: Something happens.

262
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:35,225
Speaker 0: You're like what the fuck just happened.

263
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:42,872
Speaker 1: at the same time A lot element that comes out of nowhere in a narrative that requires this meta External.

264
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:47,810
Speaker 1: it's like a deus ex machina to explain the story because the storyteller didn't do it elegantly enough.

265
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, then there's a more fundamental flaw.

266
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,116
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that's the thing.

267
00:16:52,156 --> 00:17:00,550
Speaker 0: but it's like if you're gonna cross over like that Should you put the note there or should you not put the note there and just let it go unspoken?

268
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,250
Speaker 1: I don't like to see the notes.

269
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:13,912
Speaker 0: I You'd rather have there be no no and then you read and a guy says oh and then you know remember that bitch Sharon is I'm gonna do a different way.

270
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:20,960
Speaker 1: if there is a note I'm annoyed because now it's telling me hey you have to read this other comic series to to know what's going on.

271
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:28,608
Speaker 0: sometimes you do and sometimes you know like sometimes the relation to that of the comic will be so slight and sometimes Bother even crossing it over.

272
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,460
Speaker 0: but then sometimes the relation will be very strong.

273
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:37,900
Speaker 1: But if it's strong then you've got to read both or it's not gonna make sense Even if the notes there you have to go read the other one or it still doesn't make any sense.

274
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:42,905
Speaker 0: Yep, but at least you know which one to read whereas before without the note You don't even know what the fuck.

275
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:44,391
Speaker 1: so all the note does is warn me.

276
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:52,830
Speaker 1: Hey, this is one of those comics And if the note isn't there then it's just a plot element out of nowhere Which you know what happens all the time.

277
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,690
Speaker 1: anyway in a lot of these 52 Didn't some of them already get cancelled?

278
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:57,374
Speaker 0: Yep.

279
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:06,620
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, so I picked out, you know I picked these up and I read through them and they they'd all like they'd all gotten way worse and kind of all blended together.

280
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:11,599
Speaker 1: And I don't want to ever read any more of these except maybe action comics.

281
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,363
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get the trade of action comics number.

282
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:25,580
Speaker 1: I'll read that when it shows up, but anyway things of the day.

283
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:29,191
Speaker 1: so Friend cat pointed this out to us and this kind of amazing.

284
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:34,980
Speaker 1: I'm not really gonna explain much about it You should just watch the video and kind of skip around you'll figure it out pretty pretty quickly.

285
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,080
Speaker 1: But it's a dating game called hot to fool boyfriend.

286
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:43,640
Speaker 0: Alright, is it one where you're a girl trying to date guys or we're a guy trying to date girls?

287
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,927
Speaker 1: So you're a girl human girl.

288
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,095
Speaker 1: Okay, and no warning bell number one.

289
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:48,977
Speaker 1: I had to specify human.

290
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:49,720
Speaker 0: or is it a gay one?

291
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:54,326
Speaker 1: It's not a pony thing or anything because that's the other thing I assume everyone was I'm sure those.

292
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:57,660
Speaker 0: those exist all over the I'm sure as well times a billion.

293
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,848
Speaker 1: So, uh, you're a girl human girl.

294
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:10,907
Speaker 1: you go to a school for pigeons and you Like the bird tweet try to date or not day like the rats of the sidewalk the pigeons Yes, now some of them that.

295
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:15,860
Speaker 1: basically you've got to see this to believe it, but you know It's all the typical dating game stuff.

296
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,959
Speaker 0: Well, there's that other one with the disabled people, right?

297
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,085
Speaker 1: But then you meet the pigeon and it's not even like a drawing of a pigeon It's not even like a stylist.

298
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:30,506
Speaker 1: It is just a picture of a pigeon a photograph and It's pretty great.

299
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:32,980
Speaker 1: Okay, this is this is kind of amazing.

300
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,700
Speaker 0: There's another reason one that's been getting a lot of attention because you date disabled people like a school for disabled people.

301
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,519
Speaker 0: So it's like all these people like girl in a wheelchair girl with a missing leg, you know that kind of stuff.

302
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:46,320
Speaker 1: This one is pretty awesome though, and you should play it All right.

303
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:53,620
Speaker 0: So, you know Sometimes you're in a forum on the internets or you're tweeting or something and you need a JPEG and you want to use your courage wolf.

304
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,813
Speaker 0: Or maybe you want to use that little baby who's making the fist, right?

305
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,676
Speaker 1: You know what he's called.

306
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:58,660
Speaker 0: No, what's he called?

307
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:08,499
Speaker 0: I have no idea but I like that guy or the Raptor who's scratching his chin or the guy who's like why you know or You know fry with the squinty eyes.

308
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:12,200
Speaker 1: So I googled baby fist and I can't find anything right anyway.

309
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:19,252
Speaker 0: And you know, there's a whole bunch of meme generators out there to put you know, your impact font text on Oh, he is called baby success.

310
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:20,340
Speaker 0: Okay, let me all right.

311
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,812
Speaker 0: So let me try this and you know, you know, you you want to make the JPEG with the impact font But you don't have you're not you don't have Photoshop.

312
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:28,422
Speaker 0: You're not any good at it You know.

313
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:32,580
Speaker 0: and it's like you try to find generators for that stuff and none of them are really quite that good.

314
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:37,226
Speaker 0: Well, here you go m3 m3 Us slash meme.

315
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:41,160
Speaker 0: you go to this website and it's the simplest generator in the universe.

316
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,987
Speaker 0: It's three text boxes and a button.

317
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,340
Speaker 0: you type into the second text box, right?

318
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,692
Speaker 0: You got to type in the top text in the bottom text for impact font, obviously And then you just type in the name of the generator.

319
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:54,314
Speaker 0: So what do you say?

320
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,180
Speaker 0: Was it baby success any success?

321
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,326
Speaker 0: So I'll type in baby success and then I'll type in rim Sucks and I'll click do this thing.

322
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:03,650
Speaker 0: and here we have it.

323
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:05,796
Speaker 0: Oh, it said search fail.

324
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:07,340
Speaker 0: It's not actually called baby success.

325
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,540
Speaker 1: Well, that's what the internet called it in my brief brief.

326
00:21:11,364 --> 00:21:14,220
Speaker 0: The only problem with this is you have to know the name of the thing.

327
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,421
Speaker 0: Like.

328
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:21,819
Speaker 0: I know that one guy is named why you know, so I type in why you know And then I type in you know rim why you know.

329
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:28,417
Speaker 0: good and Then I've generated a while, you know, there it is rim why you know.

330
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,546
Speaker 1: good That could be useful.

331
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,639
Speaker 1: now doesn't host the image or I have to save a timger.

332
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:35,266
Speaker 0: Let me try and see.

333
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:37,657
Speaker 0: it gives you a URL for your image.

334
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:38,400
Speaker 1: That could be dangerous.

335
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:45,195
Speaker 1: Like I should make a site like that and then like one year after it goes live all goat.

336
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:50,060
Speaker 0: see it gives you a URL And then you can use that URL and send it to him girl if you want.

337
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:54,920
Speaker 0: That's what I would do but the URL format is actually really straightforward.

338
00:21:55,061 --> 00:22:00,300
Speaker 0: So if you look at that URL format, you can just type the URL directly instead of filling out the form, huh?

339
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,184
Speaker 1: So it's dynamic.

340
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very dynamic.

341
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:05,284
Speaker 0: All right, interesting best meme generator I found.

342
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:06,130
Speaker 0: I'm gonna use a lot.

343
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,022
Speaker 1: very briefly the meta Moment.

344
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:15,126
Speaker 1: the book club books are not one but two books The Little Prince and Wind, Sand and Stars by Antoine de Salle Jupyteri.

345
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,330

346
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,173

Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

349
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:19,580
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

350
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:21,267
Speaker 0: I don't pick shit books like rim.

351
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,977
Speaker 1: We'll do a show on it soon and then I'm gonna pick a book.

352

Speaker 1: great You're gonna love.

353
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:27,278
Speaker 0: hopefully the book clubs will be more frequent.

Speaker 0: The tickets are already sold out.

365
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,817
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the three-day ones are right.

366
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:57,012
Speaker 0: Yep If you don't have a hotel and take it already, you're fucked.

367
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:58,780
Speaker 0: We told you to get one the day that came out.

00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:00,007
Speaker 0: that's tough.

370
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:00,953
Speaker 0: Yep.

371
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:01,737
Speaker 0: You don't deserve to go.

372
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:03,843
Speaker 0: That's about it.

373
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:04,767
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

374
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:07,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't believe we never did a show on this.

375
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,360
Speaker 0: It's like we go through and we're like man.

376
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:13,924
Speaker 0: We haven't done we haven't.

377
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:21,989
Speaker 0: there isn't anything recent that we've both seen read watched whatever to do a show on and usually There must be something old.

378
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,735
Speaker 0: We know we've all seen or read.

379
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:24,960
Speaker 0: Yeah that we've done it.

380
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,510
Speaker 1: But then Scott will be like slayers.

381
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:32,640
Speaker 1: and then I look and I'm like, wow So we reviewed both the slayers movie and the slayers TV show and it's like I can't believe years ago.

382
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,520
Speaker 0: I gamble and there's so many shows.

383
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,946
Speaker 0: It's like anything we come up with.

384
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:45,116
Speaker 1: we've already done the show on but recently for people who weren't paying attention All the jubilees were basically at the IFC in New York, so we're even going to see him.

385
00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:46,600
Speaker 1: and I just saw I'm poco again.

386
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,348
Speaker 0: I didn't see any pom poco.

387
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:51,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I've seen a lot of it is a pretty great movie.

388
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,404
Speaker 0: I didn't see any of the.

389
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:58,218
Speaker 1: I saw it in the theater at least once as opposed to having only seen it on the tiny crappy TV we had in Beacon.

390
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,425
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we came.

391
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:06,457
Speaker 0: we're looking for show ideas because I felt like we had a zillion Wednesday show ideas, but we didn't.

392
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:11,013
Speaker 0: and Lo and behold we came across something we never did a show on.

393
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,619
Speaker 0: I can't believe we haven't done a show on it.

394
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:15,919
Speaker 0: if we Have it's possible and someone will tell us that we suck.

395
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:26,855
Speaker 0: But as far as I got because he is the one who said and I quote as far as I can check as far as I Can tell using my intensive extensive high quality better than anyone else.

396
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,220
Speaker 0: I know Google search skills.

397
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:31,040
Speaker 0: We have never done a show on yotsubato.

398
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,813
Speaker 1: Yotsubato is written by a guy you may know because he also did Azumanga Daioh.

399
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,338
Speaker 1: Kiyohiko Azuma.

400
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:43,800
Speaker 0: Yep Azumanga Daioh was his four panel comic strip that was also turned into a great anime series.

401
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:47,620
Speaker 0: It's called Azumanga Daioh because his name is Azuma and it's a manga.

402
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,524
Speaker 0: I was a manga that he did and it was published in a magazine called Denkeki Daioh, which is mostly Sort of perverted.

403
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:55,388
Speaker 0: Yeah.

404
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,938
Speaker 1: Well, it's the thing that we often talk.

405
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:58,320
Speaker 1: It's weird.

406
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,394
Speaker 1: This is the kind of stuff that full of panty shots and cleavage we talk about at every convention But we don't really talk about on geek nights anymore because we've talked about a lot of these topics.

407
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:06,756
Speaker 1: I don't know.

408
00:25:06,776 --> 00:25:08,558
Speaker 1: in 2005 Yeah.

409
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:15,097
Speaker 0: But anyway, Yotsuba is the comic is working on now that he's still working on new volumes keep coming out No

410
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:26,506
Speaker 1: But the reason that Yotsuba or Azumanga Daioh things like this often Appeared next to the weird or perverted or kind of sexy stuff is that it tend Sainen not Shonen.

411
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:40,615
Speaker 1: but Sainen seems to have two kind of distinct branches really cute stuff and really violent and/or sexy stuff because it's aimed at You know young adults mostly men, but also women to a degree at least here.

412
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:41,558
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

413
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:53,865
Speaker 0: So Yotsuba and Azumanga Daioh are kind of more Sainen than they are anything else even though well It's weird right you look at these things and they look just really cute in my way and you're like, oh god it's gonna be right.

414
00:25:53,905 --> 00:26:02,260
Speaker 0: and there are I guess Azumanga Daioh has a panty shot and A couple boob shots somewhere in it, but Yotsuba has zero.

415
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:12,955
Speaker 0: But the point is is it's like You read these things and you look at them and at first glance they're so cute They must be for little girls or kids and they sort of are.

416
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:13,639
Speaker 0: they work for that.

417
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,813
Speaker 0: But then it's like no actually it's sort of like ponies, but it was.

418
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:19,318
Speaker 0: it's like ponies on purpose, right?

419
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:23,215
Speaker 0: It's like ponies Accidentally appealed to the older male audience.

420
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:27,933
Speaker 0: Yotsuba Intentionally appealed to the older male audience but using the same technique.

421
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,920
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, this is something important.

422
00:26:29,981 --> 00:26:32,849
Speaker 1: This tells me something about marketing.

423
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:41,429
Speaker 1: in America people who advertise things to demographics in America have no goddamn idea what Demographics actually want.

424
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,299
Speaker 1: or I think there's a more subtle problem.

425
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,085
Speaker 0: I there are things demo.

426
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:50,928
Speaker 0: there are things that demographics want that nobody makes so nobody is serving That particular.

427
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:53,080
Speaker 0: there's like a demographic has more than one to me.

428
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,745
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take the secret separate track.

429
00:26:55,107 --> 00:27:03,860
Speaker 1: the things that would be popular for a demographic are not useful Because you cannot use those to sell things to that demographic that they don't care about.

430
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:11,261
Speaker 1: Mmm, so the most coveted demographic is like the 20 to 29 year old like white male demographic Like.

431
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,868
Speaker 1: that's what a lot of people really go after.

432
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:14,394
Speaker 0: is they got money and they're gonna spend it.

433
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:24,460
Speaker 1: but the kind of stuff Are trying to sell to those people It's not gonna work because those people are actually the prime demographic stuff like ponies and Yotsuba.

434
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:25,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you'll look at me.

435
00:27:25,986 --> 00:27:31,369
Speaker 0: For example, right you can make ponies and I'll watch that shit But you can't sell me pony shit.

436
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:38,593
Speaker 0: The only pony shit you could sell me you ain't making Yeah, and you know, you can't profit if you made the good pony shit.

437
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:39,175
Speaker 0: What are you gonna make?

438
00:27:39,175 --> 00:27:39,576
Speaker 0: $100 statue?

439
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,790
Speaker 0: I'm probably not gonna buy that either.

440
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,819
Speaker 0: you have to make a fish.

441
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,743
Speaker 0: They got to do.

442
00:27:43,763 --> 00:27:44,368
Speaker 1: they got to make bus.

443
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,055
Speaker 0: I Wouldn't even I wouldn't buy a pony bus.

444
00:27:48,095 --> 00:27:48,480
Speaker 0: I hate bus.

445
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,544
Speaker 0: I only like a statue.

446
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,375
Speaker 1: what I would buy though that the statue of the horse head.

447
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:53,800
Speaker 1: that's in Twilight's apartment.

448
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:54,744
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

449
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:55,708
Speaker 1: I would I would buy that.

450
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:56,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, very subtle.

451
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:57,475
Speaker 0: Good.

452
00:27:57,495 --> 00:27:58,800
Speaker 1: My grandpa can make that for me.

453
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,730
Speaker 1: He's anyway, anyway, this is the pony show.

454
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:03,527
Speaker 1: if we're gonna review Yotsuba I want to say one thing.

455
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:06,325
Speaker 1: if you have not read Yotsuba What the fuck?

456
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:09,176
Speaker 1: or you haven't watched or read Ozumanga dial the fuck.

457
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:10,300
Speaker 1: don't even listen to this.

458
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:18,093
Speaker 1: Just go read him and watch him because Yotsuba is One of the most charming things I've ever read in my life.

459
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:19,620
Speaker 0: So Yotsuba is a manga.

460
00:28:20,862 --> 00:28:23,480
Speaker 0: It's actually a normal manga, but it's you know, it's not you know.

461
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,786
Speaker 0: Just four panels like Ozumanga.

462
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,180
Speaker 0: die was and it's separated in each chapter stands alone.

463
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,194
Speaker 0: It's very episodic, but there is a little bit of tie-in, right?

464
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:35,030
Speaker 0: So it's like in one chapter They'll be in the hot air balloon and the second the chapter after.

465
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,476
Speaker 0: that might be about something else.

466
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:37,280
Speaker 0: I forget the order.

467
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:39,160
Speaker 0: It might be about the farm or something.

468
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:47,312
Speaker 0: But they'll be like, yeah They'll mention the hot air balloon when they're on the farm or they'll introduce a character in One chapter and that character will still be around.

469
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:48,819
Speaker 0: so you're expected to sort of know who they are.

470
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:51,060
Speaker 0: But other than that, there's no continuity whatsoever.

471
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,520
Speaker 1: It's really like jumbo and yanda are some of the most important ones to know.

472
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like as long as you sort of know the characters you're gonna be set and you can figure out who they are at Any time.

473
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:00,258
Speaker 0: so basically here's how it goes.

474
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,469
Speaker 0: There's a Japanese town.

475
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:04,380
Speaker 0: It's pretty normal suburbia, right?

476
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:11,639
Speaker 0: There is a dude and he has a daughter named Yotsuba and they come from a faraway tropical island, but they speak Japanese.

477
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,403
Speaker 0: and Yotsubas like what?

478
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:14,246
Speaker 0: three four.

479
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,374
Speaker 0: She's real small not even in kindergarten.

480
00:29:16,414 --> 00:29:20,086
Speaker 0: She's like not even nursery school I don't think like barely almost nursery school.

481
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:21,671
Speaker 1: She's smarter than most people.

482
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:23,236
Speaker 1: I know and she's five right?

483
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:35,912
Speaker 0: Okay, so and he brings her to this town and he works from home, but he's busy mostly and some and The Yotsuba just sort of hangs around the house and hangs out with the neighbors and makes mention

484
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:36,394
Speaker 1: the trouble

485
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:41,292
Speaker 0: and she does cute things And such cute every doesn't

486
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:42,236
Speaker 1: do justice.

487
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:42,919
Speaker 1: What is going?

488
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:50,913
Speaker 0: well I mean, you know it's called Yotsuba toe like there's an ampersand at the end of the title and then exclamation point because each chapter is Yotsuba and something like Yotsuba.

489
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:55,247
Speaker 0: and Cardboard card bow Yotsuba and Candy.

490
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:56,619
Speaker 0: Yotsuba and water guns.

491
00:29:56,902 --> 00:30:05,660
Speaker 0: It's a band something and each chapter She encounters a thing like bicycles or flowers or who knows what and then it's all about that thing.

492
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:11,792
Speaker 0: So he's basically if you've got an idea like that Cranking out chapters must be just the easiest fucking thing in the world.

493
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:17,724
Speaker 0: because you just look around your house or outside on the street You see something you're like, oh the bookstore Bookstore episode.

494
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:18,145
Speaker 1: Yep.

495
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:23,480
Speaker 1: What would you do if you encountered my favorite thing a bird scare balloon?

496
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you just walk around you look at things and you just come up.

497
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:37,578
Speaker 0: There's a bridge Yotsuba and the bridge Yotsuba and the cable car Yotsuba and the train Yotsuba and the car, you know, it's just transportation related I mean because I'm looking out the window in New York City, right?

498
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,843
Speaker 0: So that's what I'm thinking of.

499
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:42,457
Speaker 0: but you know, it's like Yotsuba and the office building elevator.

500
00:30:42,477 --> 00:30:46,828
Speaker 0: It's about and You know kindergarten if kindergarten ever starts.

501
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:48,534
Speaker 1: now the real like the drive.

502
00:30:48,594 --> 00:31:02,359
Speaker 1: why this bong is great Is that it's so light-hearted and so just charming and Yotsuba is so Perplexed by the things around her but yet at the same time has a certain level of insight into these things.

503
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:04,764
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean it's typically what it does.

504
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:05,505
Speaker 0: is it takes.

505
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:11,305
Speaker 0: you know that aspect of childhood in that, you know Kids, they're cute.

506
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:17,011
Speaker 0: They react to things In interesting and unexpected ways because they don't understand them.

507
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:19,380
Speaker 1: yet children tend to ask the obvious question.

508
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:29,220
Speaker 0: They also have an incredible insight and it takes those Aspects of childhood puts them in Yotsuba and amplifies them times a hundred and gets rid of all the other aspects.

509
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:31,889
Speaker 1: but at the same time there's a very strong.

510
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:37,947
Speaker 1: it's kind of like Yotsuba is there and then there's the straight man cast of Everyone else in the world around her.

511
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:38,168
Speaker 0: Yeah.

512
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:41,840
Speaker 0: Well, not everyone else is a total straight man, but they're pretty much relative to Yotsuba.

513
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,403
Speaker 1: They are yeah, they're normal people But they had.

514
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:48,739
Speaker 1: they all will have like a little bit of Yotsuba style reactions to certain kinds of things and they do.

515
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,868
Speaker 0: each Character actually has a personality.

516
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:52,133
Speaker 0: It's not just like a whole right.

517
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:53,860
Speaker 0: It's like, you know jumbo.

518
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:59,338
Speaker 0: He's just sort of like this chill cool dude, but he's gigantic and he's a little shy and weird.

519
00:31:59,378 --> 00:31:59,900
Speaker 0: with the ladies.

520
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,321
Speaker 0: I really like Asagi the the oldest sister the oldest sister who's you don't get too much of her early on so Sarcastic.

521
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:10,035
Speaker 0: Yeah, but she's she's like sort of like cynical and slightly badass.

522
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:16,736
Speaker 0: and then you've got you know The the neighbor mom is just sort of like a cool totally awesome mom who's all responsible and shit.

523
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:21,560
Speaker 0: and then You know, basically it's mostly the neighbors of the heaviest used characters right?

524
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:24,035
Speaker 1: I was a thousand feet tall and yonder is no good.

525
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:24,519
Speaker 0: Yeah.

526
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,867
Speaker 0: Yeah I love how yonder like.

527
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:33,417
Speaker 0: oh that guy's no good and they keep talking about him But you don't see him and then eventually he shows up spoilers and he's actually no good.

528
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:34,200
Speaker 0: He's pretty no good.

529
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,043
Speaker 0: He's like.

530
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:35,846
Speaker 0: then does it?

531
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:37,272
Speaker 0: you know the guy in the Baltimore Ravens?

532
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:38,015
Speaker 0: His name is yonder.

533
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:38,597
Speaker 0: No good.

534
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,507
Speaker 1: He's no good you know, it's telling.

535
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:46,248
Speaker 1: you know, we were reading this way back and Yonda became kind of our term for no good.

536
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:49,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like, man, that's so yonder and that meant it was no good.

537
00:32:49,379 --> 00:33:02,011
Speaker 0: Yep So the arts in it is obviously, you know The typical Azuma art style the same as I was among Adele, but the backgrounds he loads up on the backgrounds I was among Adele didn't really have background so much.

538
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:03,116
Speaker 0: Yeah Yotsuba.

539
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:03,920
Speaker 0: He lays it out.

540
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:07,759
Speaker 0: I'm sure his assistant does that shit or something, but I mean the backgrounds are pretty great.

541
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:10,175
Speaker 0: They're almost as good as Death Note backgrounds.

542
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:10,819
Speaker 0: They're crazy.

543
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:14,556
Speaker 0: And that's really important because it's all about like what Yotsuba is doing.

544
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:15,280
Speaker 0: is she in her house?

545
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,345
Speaker 0: Is she in the neighbor's house?

546
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:16,747
Speaker 0: Is she?

547
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:18,776
Speaker 0: you know, she's riding a hot-air balloon.

548
00:33:18,876 --> 00:33:19,760
Speaker 0: She's driving in a car.

549
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:20,159
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

550
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:27,180
Speaker 1: So all that stuff becomes really she in the playground of the bear that she took in the hot-air balloon like Jarleman.

551
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:42,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that like the bear just falls out of the balloon and of course Yotsuba is devastated by this and it just lands in this field like kind of Standing like straight up and I think Asagi or someone's over there and she just has this reaction.

552
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:43,660
Speaker 1: That is priceless.

553
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:47,341
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's always like the facial expression is what it's all about Cuz.

554
00:33:47,381 --> 00:34:00,500
Speaker 1: he you know, you'll see like crazy eyes or dot eyes or wiggly mouth But it's not a pause of you know, multiple panels of the face slightly changing like building up to the reaction aka the explosion.

555
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:08,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like he won't do the cheap cop-out like a lot of old Mangas and animes to do the super deform like, you know slayers even does that where it's like, you know.

556
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:19,054
Speaker 0: But this you'll keep the character on model and then just make the crazy extreme deform facial expression But he won't deform the whole thing and make it crazy chibi with like triangle arms.

557
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,827
Speaker 0: suddenly, you know and It'll do the same thing that you just said.

558
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:31,199
Speaker 0: where it's like you'll see Yotsuba and it'll be the same frame three times Right of her like her head is down and in the fourth frame her head is up and her eyes are like wiggle.

559
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,391
Speaker 1: wiggle I got Yotsuba angry is one of my favorite things which is funny.

560
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:44,860
Speaker 1: cuz with the pet right or a little kid You like them when they're happy, but you also like like it is enjoyable to watch a like a pet animal.

561
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:52,092
Speaker 1: It's like who is annoyed and perplexed by something not harming them But is simultaneously like a dog who can't figure something out like.

562
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:56,147
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter what their emotion is It just matters the form their emotion takes.

563
00:34:56,167 --> 00:35:02,640
Speaker 0: like you can laugh at a baby crying or you can laugh at a baby laugh Standing next to a baby just laughing.

564
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:07,720
Speaker 0: It's like you can laugh at almost any reaction it's having if it's having an extreme crazy.

565
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,635
Speaker 1: Well, like for example, one of our bunnies moogie is a little temperamental like he's.

566
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:18,909
Speaker 1: he's a worried rabbit so sometimes we'll be sitting there and he'll just be like This is no good and he'll like walk over to the corner.

567
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:27,779
Speaker 1: Look at us and thump and just kind of be like And I want to go pet him, but I'm also just kind of I can't help but laugh at him being so moody.

568
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:31,825
Speaker 1: Exactly So, you know what?

569
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,855
Speaker 1: I realize there's a three-way recommendation.

570
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:43,474
Speaker 1: if you like My Little Pony Azumanga die Oh or Yotsuba any one of the three you will like the other two Probably pretty much straight up and it's weird like Yotsuba has started.

571
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:44,236
Speaker 0: if you don't notice.

572
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:48,960
Speaker 0: like Yotsuba You know her name means four leaf clover and she has four pigtails.

573
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,519
Speaker 0: Her hair is green and she has four big tail.

574
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,386
Speaker 1: Unofficial mascot of fortune.

575
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:56,035
Speaker 1: not not by any action on Osmo's part.

576
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:57,540
Speaker 1: That's just fortune being fortune.

577
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:02,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know It's you'll see her around the Internet's and it's like.

578
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:06,645
Speaker 0: don't think that because fortune is fortunes unofficial mascot There's something going on there.

579
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:07,308
Speaker 0: That's wrong.

580
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,720
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the comic is the comic.

581
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:18,540
Speaker 0: It's a good comic on its own Regardless of what people may do with it or use it for or what comics other fans may draw with Yotsuba in them.

582
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:22,149
Speaker 1: And such it was a pretty scary disclaimer.

583
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:22,911
Speaker 0: ignore that.

584
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,960
Speaker 0: I mean, it's you know rule 34 is in effect is basically what I'm saying.

585
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,220
Speaker 0: That's all I'm saying.

586
00:36:28,464 --> 00:36:29,458
Speaker 0: It's always in effect.

587
00:36:31,384 --> 00:36:31,932
Speaker 0: If you didn't really.

588
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:35,040
Speaker 0: it's like, you know Stu Leonard has the three rules and is in the front of his store.

589
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,281
Speaker 0: He's like.

590
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:49,380
Speaker 0: the customer is always right if you if the customer is wrong re re rule number one It's like well rule 34 if this you know, and then rule number 35 is like well, if not rule 34 re re rule 34.

591
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,874
Speaker 1: So there is no anime of Yotsuba and I don't know if there ever will be.

592
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:54,175
Speaker 1: we.

593
00:36:54,336 --> 00:36:55,038
Speaker 0: there was a news.

594
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:55,600
Speaker 0: I what I did.

595
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,545
Speaker 0: I see.

596
00:36:56,565 --> 00:37:00,900
Speaker 1: I could see economic pressure like causing it to happen But I don't think anyone involved would want it.

597
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:04,040
Speaker 0: I did a new I look when I was searching to see if we did an episode on this.

598
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,929
Speaker 0: I found a news where we talked about.

599
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:11,856
Speaker 0: there was a link that Ozzie where Ozzie Doesn't think it would why why he would never do an anime for Yotsuba.

600
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:12,519
Speaker 0: So I don't think he's gonna.

601
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,740
Speaker 1: However, I don't think it's a Calvin and Hobbes situation.

602
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,537
Speaker 1: I think someone could go to him with a sack of money and it might happen.

603
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:20,040
Speaker 0: Who knows?

604
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:23,086
Speaker 0: Who knows what his personality is?

605
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:27,740
Speaker 1: the only person in the world I know of but he actually turned down the sack of money.

606
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,286
Speaker 0: The thing is he keeps doing Yotsuba.

607
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,275
Speaker 0: volumes keep coming out regularly.

608
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:32,500
Speaker 0: There aren't like huge delays.

609
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:36,215
Speaker 0: It was published in the US by a DV which failed obviously.

610
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:51,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then It's now published by I think yen press if I'm not mistaken, which is sadly, you know not to harp on translations But at least initially like the first few yen presses I read the translation was kind of shit compared to the original Translate.

611
00:37:51,362 --> 00:37:58,054
Speaker 0: Well, I think the biggest difference in that fan people care about it so much is you know The new one the yen press one or with the new one.

612
00:37:58,094 --> 00:37:58,556
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

613
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,240
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's yeah.

614
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,340
Speaker 0: It was less like new on it does a lot of the you know, keeping in honorifics and stuff like that.

615
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,445
Speaker 1: Yeah and it's kind of translation like a lot of the sentence is just Really don't sound natural.

616
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:14,880
Speaker 1: and the ADV one by comparison read really naturally and actually yeah a little bit of the charm is lost.

617
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,971
Speaker 0: The thing is I don't even really notice that much.

618
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:18,500
Speaker 0: I just read it and the thing is it's great.

619
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:23,837
Speaker 1: I've read entire volumes of Yotsuba in Japanese and I can't read really any Japanese.

620
00:38:23,857 --> 00:38:28,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know They're may wait There are a lot of Japanese volumes are that are out in the America.

621
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:29,199
Speaker 0: the English ones aren't out.

622
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:35,039
Speaker 0: yet If you can get the Japanese ones It's really even if you don't know Japanese and you'll never be able to read it.

623
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:38,700
Speaker 0: You can get like 50% of the jokes just looking at it.

624
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,869
Speaker 0: You don't really need to read the words so much.

625
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:43,300
Speaker 0: once you know, the character is just looking at what they're doing.

626
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:55,474
Speaker 0: That's usually enough You know, there's fact is like even though the dialogue is it's not like if you're a beginning Japanese reader You probably wouldn't be able to read it because it is real Japanese language and such.

627
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:56,919
Speaker 1: but it's pretty simple.

628
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:59,792
Speaker 0: The quantity of dialogue is low.

629
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:01,540
Speaker 0: There isn't a lot of words.

630
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:05,920
Speaker 0: It's not like incredibly wordy with lots of sci-fi words going on all over the place.

631
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,045
Speaker 0: It's like they don't say much.

632
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:12,528
Speaker 0: they say about as much as normal people say and it's a lot of just you know Panels without even talking.

633
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:18,639
Speaker 0: or you know people looking at something Or a person says one thing and then the rest of the page is them doing the thing.

634
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:23,100
Speaker 0: So you don't really need to read so much at all to understand what's going on.

635
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,680
Speaker 0: You can tell just by the panels and it's it's just that good.

636
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:32,540
Speaker 0: Well a well-produced comic that you you can follow it sequentially, you know, so many comics are you know?

637
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,820
Speaker 0: If you took the words out of like a Marvel comic it wouldn't mean dick.

638
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:42,859
Speaker 0: It would just be like there's a panel with spider-man in it and there's a panel But how will I know whether or not he's actually punching that little guy?

639
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:47,700
Speaker 0: And it's like every panel has a different guy in it in different plays doing something different.

640
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,895
Speaker 0: It would make no sense, but yotsuba makes total sense even without words And you should read it and buy all the volumes.

641
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:54,540
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

642
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,164
Speaker 0: I can't believe.

643
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,569
Speaker 1: there people haven't read this yet now I don't know if we've actually done a show on awesome.

644
00:39:58,589 --> 00:39:59,453
Speaker 1: We got dial either.

645
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:04,175
Speaker 1: So rather than talk about it I'm just gonna let it be for a night like this when it's a late.

646
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:05,300
Speaker 0: same shit in high school.

647
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:11,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, same guy same shit little little different feeling a little more sarcastic at time.

648
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:15,619
Speaker 0: This is primarily humorous though, which is great because there really aren't that many.

649
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:29,000
Speaker 0: You know comics that are good and funny and awesome and you know Except this this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
