1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,892
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday, June 1st, I'm Rem.

2
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:12,414
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:13,900
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

4
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 1: Documentation... Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,530
Speaker 0: So the other day, I slipped out of work for a long lunch.

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,150
Speaker 0: Now, I often take a short lunch, but I decided time for a long lunch.

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,923
Speaker 0: So I walk over to Bryant Park, and I get myself a baguette of some kind.

8
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:43,374
Speaker 1: Bryant Park, where most people are not eating lunch, they're working.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,704
Speaker 0: Ah, Bryant Park.

10
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:45,530
Speaker 0: You know, it's true.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,310
Speaker 0: I mean, I go to Bryant Park, and there's just people with laptops, like half of them from my office.

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,157
Speaker 1: Right, there are many parks in New York City, right?

13
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:54,890
Speaker 1: But Bryant Park has, A, an incredible abundance of chairs and tables.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,130
Speaker 0: It is on 42nd Street, well, near 42nd Street, at Midtown.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:08,370
Speaker 1: It's near a whole bunch of office buildings, and Google has covered the whole thing in Wi-Fi that is free and easily accessible without any bullshit.

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,150
Speaker 0: That Wi-Fi is so overloaded, I use my Verizon card when I'm there.

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,832
Speaker 1: I know, right?

18
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:21,096
Speaker 1: But, as a result of the excessive number of tables and chairs, and also the Google Wi-Fi, a lot of people just go work there.

19
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:25,549
Speaker 1: Freelancers, people who just want to get out of the office, tons of people.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,373
Speaker 0: If I lived in Manhattan,

21
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:28,838
Speaker 1: old guys who play chess,

22
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:32,970
Speaker 0: if I lived in Manhattan, and I were a gigger, or a freelancer, or worked for myself,

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,939
Speaker 1: or even if you're just a telecommuter who also lived in the city,

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,009
Speaker 0: Bryant Park would be my office nine months out of the year.

25
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,470
Speaker 1: Well, it does get cold.

26
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,149
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,390
Speaker 0: Woman.

28
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:44,348
Speaker 0: Never gets cold.

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:44,946
Speaker 0: It gets cold.

30
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,568
Speaker 0: It'll never get cold again.

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,070
Speaker 1: The thing is, once it's cold, they build an ice rink there, so you know to stop working.

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,409
Speaker 0: But then I can ice skate.

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,749
Speaker 1: Yes, but you will not get any monies.

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,315
Speaker 0: I made a critical mistake.

35
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:58,530
Speaker 0: I walked out, and I didn't bring any entertainment with me like I usually do.

36
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,730
Speaker 0: I just forgot my bag, so I didn't have my idea.

37
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,030
Speaker 1: Well, you could buy some entertainment very easily.

38
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,829
Speaker 0: Well, no, I decided- I decided to just sit there and enjoy my lunch and think.

39
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:08,668
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

40
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:14,050
Speaker 0: And, of course, because I'm unoccupied by- Wait, you don't have an iPod or a laptop.

41
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:21,650
Speaker 0: I'm just sitting there in a comfortable chair, staring out over the park going, "Ahh," and eating my hummus and ham baguette.

42
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:28,370
Speaker 1: That means that if there are people's about, they can see that you do not have headphones, which means you can hear what they are saying.

43
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,200
Speaker 0: These two kids, they were like 19, made a beeline for me.

44
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,369
Speaker 0: I can see them from across the park.

45
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:36,350
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,830
Speaker 0: And they're walking directly at me and talking to each other and kind of looking at me.

47
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,935
Speaker 0: It's like, "All right, what's this?

48
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,564
Speaker 0: Are these listeners?

49
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:43,670
Speaker 0: Do they recognize me?

50
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,162
Speaker 0: Am I about to get mugged?

51
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:45,727
Speaker 0: What's going

52
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:45,929
Speaker 0: on?".

53
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,370
Speaker 1: This trouble's brewing.

54
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,010
Speaker 0: And they come up, and they're real, real friendly.

55
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,049
Speaker 0: And right about now is when my missionary alert goes off.

56
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,426
Speaker 1: "Anyone who's too friendly must be

57
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:57,750
Speaker 1: religious.".

58
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,152
Speaker 1: You know what?

59
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:06,650
Speaker 0: That has never been not the case with the possible exception of some mentally not-so-there people who are friendly for other reasons.

60
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,450
Speaker 0: I've had that situation.

61
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:11,579
Speaker 0: "Join me.

62
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,607
Speaker 1: We will start a new

63
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:12,990
Speaker 1: kingdom.".

64
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,385
Speaker 0: "I, too, have lost a

65
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:15,689
Speaker 0: kingdom.".

66
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,670
Speaker 1: It's actually, it's sort of scary.

67
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,610
Speaker 1: Just in general, anyone who's too friendly, it's usually bad news.

68
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:34,490
Speaker 1: When I was in summer camp, when I was a counselor, they had this sort of mandatory training where they taught you, because pedophiles like to become summer camp counselors, right?

69
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:36,710
Speaker 1: So they trained all the counselors.

70
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:44,590
Speaker 1: They basically said, "This is how to identify a pedophile," short of actually seeing them being a pedophile, right?

71
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,946
Speaker 1: And they said, "Watch out for people who are scarily

72
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:48,509
Speaker 1: friendly.".

73
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,710
Speaker 0: Well, "scarily" is the point, because I've noticed.

74
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,483
Speaker 1: They also said that if you are a pedophile, just leave now, and we won't say anything.

75
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,409
Speaker 1: Just get up and go.

76
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,968
Speaker 1: Not at the meeting, but you know.

77
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Joey Jojo doesn't show up to the next meeting after that.

78
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,865
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's just, they said, "After this meeting, just leave camp, and we won't, that'll be

79
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:11,007
Speaker 1: it.".

80
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,310
Speaker 1: And no one left.

81
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,650
Speaker 0: Is it that much of a problem?

82
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,430
Speaker 1: It's a significant thing.

83
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:19,930
Speaker 1: I think that's sort of law, actually, that makes it mandatory at all the summer camps.

84
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,649
Speaker 0: What, mandatory pedophiles?

85
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,230
Speaker 1: No, mandatory pedophile avoidance training.

86
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:31,208
Speaker 0: But "scarily" is the key, because some people are just really friendly, and those people never set off any alarms for me.

87
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,630
Speaker 0: But there are people who are friendly in the uncanny valley of friendliness.

88
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:42,330
Speaker 0: It is either too far beyond what is reasonable for friendly, or just short of actually friendly.

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,370
Speaker 0: And these people reeked of that, the "too far," to a frightening degree.

90
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,863
Speaker 0: And they're being really friendly, and they're like, "Hey, so what are you up

91
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:51,005
Speaker 0: to?".

92
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,330
Speaker 0: I was like, "I'm sitting here enjoying my baguette.

93
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,348
Speaker 0: I'm being real friendly, too.

94
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,947
Speaker 0: I've got the smile that... You've seen this smile

95
00:04:58,968 --> 00:04:59,110
Speaker 0: before.".

96
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,290
Speaker 1: "I did not bring entertainment!

97
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:01,660
Speaker 1: Look!

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,850
Speaker 1: Lo, there must be a God!

99
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,665
Speaker 1: He has brought entertainment unto

100
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:04,908
Speaker 1: me!".

101
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:11,650
Speaker 0: This was the smile of that guy at the anime con who was arguing with the crazy Jesus guy outside of anime Boston.

102
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,230
Speaker 1: That guy at the anime con wasn't smiling.

103
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,949
Speaker 1: I think he was a stupid teenager who still thought that he was gonna, you know...

104
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,530
Speaker 0: I don't know, when he walked up, he had the smile.

105
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,209
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

106
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:19,930
Speaker 1: I don't know.

107
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,469
Speaker 0: The smile might have gone away, I don't know.

108
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,510
Speaker 0: So I'm humoring them.

109
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:25,850
Speaker 0: I'm enjoying this conversation.

110
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,289
Speaker 0: They haven't brought up religion yet.

111
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:28,108
Speaker 0: At all.

112
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,770
Speaker 0: For like five minutes, no religion.

113
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,570
Speaker 0: But I know it's coming.

114
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,970
Speaker 0: I'm so sure it's coming.

115
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,010
Speaker 0: And then they're like, "Yeah, so we're new to the city.

116
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:36,517
Speaker 0: We're

117
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:36,930
Speaker 0: missionaries.".

118
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:39,970
Speaker 0: And we're conducting... Really?

119
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:40,928
Speaker 1: I'm on a mission, too.

120
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:41,646
Speaker 1: To Mars.

121
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:44,010
Speaker 0: We're conducting a survey.

122
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,730
Speaker 0: We're just trying to ask people about their lives and about what they're up to to kind of get a feel for New York.

123
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,949
Speaker 0: You know, we're not from around here.

124
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,310
Speaker 1: Really?

125
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:51,189
Speaker 1: I haven't noticed.

126
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,787
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Oh, where are you

127
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:52,989
Speaker 0: from?".

128
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,350
Speaker 1: You're friendly.

129
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:56,025
Speaker 0: I just engaged them straight up because I got about 48 minutes to kill.

130
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,490
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

131
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,169
Speaker 1: That's a lot of time to fuck them up.

132
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,689
Speaker 0: I was willing to entertain anything they had to say for the next 48 minutes, and they were not going to get away from me politely.

133
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,085
Speaker 0: And they're like, "Oh, I'm from

134
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:09,569
Speaker 0: Michigan."

135
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:10,341
Speaker 0: And, "Oh, I know

136
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:10,728
Speaker 0: Michigan.".

137
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,950
Speaker 0: And I had a lot of anecdotes back and forth, and I kept them talking for a while.

138
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:23,976
Speaker 0: And then their first question is like, "So how do you feel about our mission that we should all be one family under God with no prejudice against anyone and everyone's just cool with

139
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:24,362
Speaker 0: everyone?".

140
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,548
Speaker 0: And I was like, "I'm for all of that, but there's no

141
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:27,770
Speaker 0: God.".

142
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,990
Speaker 0: And the guy's like, "Oh, really?

143
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,089
Speaker 0: Well, how did you come to that?

144
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,026
Speaker 0: Like, why do you believe that there's no

145
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:35,329
Speaker 0: God?".

146
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:36,390
Speaker 0: And I was like, "You know what?

147
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:43,287
Speaker 0: To be honest, for the last 8,000 years of human history, there's never been a single recorded instance of anything supernatural of any kind in any capacity

148
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:43,528
Speaker 0: ever.".

149
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:46,110
Speaker 0: And then I started explaining the James Randi Foundation.

150
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:53,647
Speaker 0: And at this point I realized that one of these people is the seasoned missionary who is training the other one how to do this.

151
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:04,350
Speaker 0: And the one who was being trained was fucked because everything I said, I would get him to agree with it because logic always wins.

152
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,341
Speaker 0: So at one point I was like, "How do you feel about

153
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,007
Speaker 0: homosexuals?".

154
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,129
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Well, they're people too.

155
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,868
Speaker 0: And while I don't agree with what they do, they should be

156
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:14,170
Speaker 0: afraid.".

157
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,268
Speaker 0: He's really backpedaling here.

158
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,410
Speaker 0: But in the end, I pushed him into agreeing that they should have equal rights.

159
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,785
Speaker 0: So then I'm like, "So how about the right to

160
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:22,147
Speaker 0: marry?".

161
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,276
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Well...".

162
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,837
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Because you really can't deny that and still say that it's equal and still say...".

163
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:30,850
Speaker 0: And he basically, after a lot of hemming and hawing, is like, "You know what?

164
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:31,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're right.

165
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,210
Speaker 0: We really should let him get married.

166
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:36,108
Speaker 0: We can't really justifiably...".

167
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,370
Speaker 0: And that's when the other guy interrupts him.

168
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:39,625
Speaker 0: He's like, "Uh, we got to

169
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:39,848
Speaker 0: go.".

170
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:41,889
Speaker 0: And he just wraps this up and drags the kid away.

171
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,470
Speaker 0: I don't know if I opened someone's mind, but it was somewhat hilarious.

172
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,829
Speaker 0: And then I had another half hour to eat because they left.

173
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:52,610
Speaker 1: I wanted him to stay.

174
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,010
Speaker 0: I wanted to convince both of them.

175
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,069
Speaker 0: I wanted to talk to them.

176
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,750
Speaker 1: Well, that proves that, A, there was a God, and he was coming to check on you.

177
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,730
Speaker 1: And he found out, right?

178
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,730
Speaker 1: He was giving you a chance.

179
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:05,270
Speaker 1: He gave you some entertainment, but then he found out that you were still against him.

180
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:06,930
Speaker 1: So he took your entertainment away.

181
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,008
Speaker 0: Luckily, a chipmunk came out.

182
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:12,989
Speaker 0: I was good for the rest of lunch.

183
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,070
Speaker 1: It was a chipmunk in Bryant Park, really?

184
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of chipmunks in Bryant Park.

185
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,489
Speaker 1: Wow, where do they live?

186
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,149
Speaker 0: I don't know.

187
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,109
Speaker 0: They come and they run around and kids feed them.

188
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,730
Speaker 1: Uh, the pigeons don't, uh, dominate?

189
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,169
Speaker 0: Chipmunks are faster than pigeons.

190
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,988
Speaker 1: I don't know, but a chicken can peck the chipmunk in the... Chicken?

191
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:30,459
Speaker 1: Yeah.

192
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:31,947
Speaker 1: All right.

193
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,230
Speaker 1: I had a tiny, quick experience on the train this morning.

194
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,549
Speaker 1: I'm sitting in one of the four-seaters, and in the four-seater across from me is a fat lady.

195
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,530
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

196
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:48,642
Speaker 0: Now, much like how my "these people are missionaries" sense went off, was this person in...

197
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:51,790
Speaker 1: I didn't even notice them, right?

198
00:08:52,290 --> 00:09:03,190
Speaker 1: Some guy basically comes, some guy walks up and he starts, like, he looks at me and he asks me something, and I got my etymotics in, so I'm just like, "Uhhh," you know, sleeping.

199
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,988
Speaker 1: But then he, like, he asks the fat lady something, so I'm looking at him because suddenly there's something to pay attention to, right?

200
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:15,076
Speaker 1: And I pull one of the headphones out and he's like, "Something, something, beeping something, something,".

201
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:20,320
Speaker 1: and I see that one of the fat ladies has a cell phone, and I sort of figured out pretty quickly.

202
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,029
Speaker 1: she was playing a video game on her cell phone that was making lots of beeping noises, and she wasn't turning the sound off.

203
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,649
Speaker 1: So then another guy, right, this guy goes to sit down.

204
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,949
Speaker 1: Someone else comes up and asks her to, like, you know, "Hey, turn it off," right?

205
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,078
Speaker 1: "Indignancy!

206
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:38,047
Speaker 1: Activate!".

207
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:49,090
Speaker 1: And the indignancy passed, the indignancy of the fat lady playing the video game passed to the other fat lady, so it's like they double activated the indignancy.

208
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,127
Speaker 0: Wait, so the person who wasn't playing the game was indignant?

209
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:52,530
Speaker 0: now?

210
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:53,187
Speaker 1: Yes.

211
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:53,736
Speaker 0: Why?

212
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:54,270
Speaker 0: Were they friends?

213
00:09:54,811 --> 00:10:02,001
Speaker 1: No, she just, you know, she got indignant and she just started talking and talking and talking in indignant talk while everyone else is sitting, right?

214
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:08,050
Speaker 1: And she eventually activated, she just activated the indignant talk in the other fat lady after a time.

215
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:08,553
Speaker 0: You know what?

216
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:11,029
Speaker 0: Maybe there must be some sort of API for this.

217
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:14,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, the conductor eventually came and he's like, "What's the

218
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:14,390
Speaker 1: problem?".

219
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:17,536
Speaker 0: You know what?

220
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:26,010
Speaker 0: I gotta say, this is why I love New York and why I love Metro North, because if someone is annoying on the train, the conductor will come and make them shut the fuck up.

221
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,009
Speaker 1: And the conductor, he was basically just like, "Fuck this shit," and he just left.

222
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:32,488
Speaker 1: He's like, "I don't give a fuck

223
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:32,650
Speaker 1: this.".

224
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,730
Speaker 1: Luckily, the original indignant lady got off a Croton Harmon.

225
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,232
Speaker 1: Oh.

226
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,109
Speaker 1: The other indignant lady remained indignant for maybe a minute or two and just talked to herself indignantly.

227
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,497
Speaker 0: What do you say?

228
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,190
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, I know exactly what they said.

229
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,910
Speaker 1: I don't know what they said because I had my etymotics and all I heard was...

230
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,585
Speaker 0: Well, first they'll huff.

231
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:56,964
Speaker 0: They'll be like... And then they'll be like, "I don't know why you people are so rude.

232
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,531
Speaker 0: Why do people have to be so rude?

233
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:00,439
Speaker 1: Why can't people just think

234
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:00,499
Speaker 1: up?".

235
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,668
Speaker 1: And then they shut up for the rest of the ride.

236
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,149
Speaker 1: That's it.

237
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,120
Speaker 0: I've noticed a trend lately, though.

238
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,030
Speaker 0: A lot of people, if I take a later train home...

239
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,770
Speaker 1: I wanted to see someone try to hit the conductor and go to jail for seven years.

240
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,129
Speaker 0: I've seen people get close.

241
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,569
Speaker 1: Over a cell phone video game.

242
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,369
Speaker 0: This old, old guy, when I used to take the train from the Bronx...

243
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,069
Speaker 1: Man, that's a death sentence for an old guy.

244
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:26,694
Speaker 0: This guy was like 90, and he had a cane, and he's sitting there, and the conductor is like, "You gotta pay more.

245
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,309
Speaker 0: The senior citizen's discount doesn't count on peak trains through rush

246
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:31,550
Speaker 0: hour.".

247
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,478
Speaker 1: "That's right, old man.

248
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:33,346
Speaker 1: Pay the full

249
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:33,689
Speaker 1: price.".

250
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,208
Speaker 0: And the old man's like, "I'm not paying, and you can't make

251
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:36,269
Speaker 0: me.".

252
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,684
Speaker 0: And the conductor's like, "I'll call the

253
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:38,008
Speaker 0: police.".

254
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,559
Speaker 1: "You're going to

255
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:38,846
Speaker 1: jail.".

256
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,287
Speaker 0: And the guy raises his cane, and the conductor just says, "Go for

257
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:42,408
Speaker 0: it.".

258
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,047
Speaker 1: He said, "Go for

259
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:44,169
Speaker 1: it?".

260
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,663
Speaker 0: He said, "Go for

261
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:44,808
Speaker 0: it.".

262
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,636
Speaker 1: "All right!

263
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:46,140
Speaker 1: Yeah!".

264
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:53,958
Speaker 1: "That's awesome.

265
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:55,128
Speaker 1: Go for

266
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:55,249
Speaker 1: it.".

267
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,427
Speaker 0: That's second only to, "And they're

268
00:11:58,548 --> 00:11:58,669
Speaker 0: off.".

269
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:00,824
Speaker 1: "Okay.".

270
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:02,541
Speaker 0: So, it's Monday.

271
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:03,290
Speaker 0: It's Tech Day.

272
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,210
Speaker 0: Welcome to all you new people from anime Boston.

273
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,369
Speaker 0: I'm sure some of you accidentally listened to this show.

274
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:12,729
Speaker 1: By the way, I'm going to say this.

275
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,681
Speaker 1: On this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, June 1, 2, 3, 5, and

276
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:20,317
Speaker 1: 6? 4, 5, 6. 5

277
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:21,250
Speaker 1: and 6.

278
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,010
Speaker 1: MOCA Arts Festival, New York City, something or other armory.

279
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,020
Speaker 1: It moved.

280
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,450
Speaker 1: It's not in the Puck Building anymore.

281
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,417
Speaker 0: We'll link to it again.

282
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,130
Speaker 0: We'll probably be there Saturday.

283
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,930
Speaker 1: If you go to Google and you search for MOCA Arts Festival, you will find it.

284
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,670
Speaker 0: We will probably be there Saturday.

285
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,330
Speaker 0: We have stuff going on that weekend.

286
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,630
Speaker 0: If that fails, we'll be there Sunday no matter what.

287
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,689
Speaker 1: What are we going on this weekend?

288
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,688
Speaker 0: A bunch of people might be coming over and then going to the MOCA with us.

289
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,428
Speaker 1: That's Saturday then.

290
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:48,974
Speaker 1: Yeah.

291
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:49,829
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

292
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:50,835
Speaker 1: Yeah.

293
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,570
Speaker 1: Really, it's two days, Saturday and Sunday.

294
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,949
Speaker 1: You only need to go one day.

295
00:12:55,171 --> 00:13:04,830
Speaker 1: There's so few panels that unless you really want to go to a panel one day and a panel the other day, there's not much of a reason to go both days.

296
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:12,130
Speaker 0: Well, my plan though is I was thinking I want to do karaoke with the group, but I also want to go see the World of Darkness before they shut it down.

297
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,909
Speaker 0: Which is already closed.

298
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,230
Speaker 1: It's been apparently, they didn't even give you a lead.

299
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,690
Speaker 1: They were just like, yes, closing closed.

300
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,182
Speaker 0: Ah, ah, ah.

301
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,950
Speaker 1: Plus, you wouldn't have time to see the World of Darkness and do the MOCA in one day.

302
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:26,428
Speaker 0: I would.

303
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,310
Speaker 1: Unless you went to like way early.

304
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,509
Speaker 1: Depends what time the MOCA opens because the MOCA opens.

305
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:34,130
Speaker 1: You could go to it early enough, then go to the World of Darkness.

306
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:36,830
Speaker 1: And depending on when the zoo closes, stay late.

307
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,210
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter when you go to the MOCA because I never go to panels.

308
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:42,870
Speaker 0: I just walk to every single table and look at every single thing.

309
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,370
Speaker 0: Exactly.

310
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:44,029
Speaker 0: And then I leave.

311
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,297
Speaker 0: Yep.

312
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:49,628
Speaker 0: And if someone cool like Jason is there, I stand in line to giggle like a schoolgirl while he draws something for me.

313
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:50,624
Speaker 1: OK.

314
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,890
Speaker 0: That was basically what we did.

315
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,408
Speaker 0: So I had the microphone on.

316
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:57,110
Speaker 1: It's just like a million tech news is, but we're not doing a tech news round up.

317
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,906
Speaker 1: So we had to choose just to talk about Bing.

318
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,067
Speaker 1: No, not OK.

319
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:03,189
Speaker 1: Ready here real quick.

320
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,990
Speaker 1: Bing is a Google clone and it's not significantly better than Google.

321
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:07,928
Speaker 1: So it has no use.

322
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,541
Speaker 1: All right.

323
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,749
Speaker 1: If people are going to use it for a little bit because it's new and it's in the news, then they're going to forget about it.

324
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,690
Speaker 0: The only thing I want to say right now is AOL Time Warner finally.

325
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:19,910
Speaker 0: And well, I actually want to talk about the Palm trees.

326
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,188
Speaker 1: OK, it's the real news.

327
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,169
Speaker 1: Google way.

328
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:23,930
Speaker 0: All right.

329
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:25,349
Speaker 0: So I was at work.

330
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,070
Speaker 0: You know, we were all at work when the news of disappeared.

331
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:31,430
Speaker 0: And I saw the Slashdot article and I was like, all right, Google wave.

332
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,950
Speaker 0: That's probably something stupid I don't care about.

333
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:39,270
Speaker 0: And like an hour later, I you know, I have some time before I go to lunch.

334
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:45,450
Speaker 0: I click on the article and then I click on the thing and I start watching the video and suddenly it's like, wait a minute.

335
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,168
Speaker 0: What is this?

336
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,146
Speaker 0: So I go back and actually read what it is.

337
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:57,549
Speaker 1: So Google Wave, basically, I am really you know, I usually am so the cynical say that's going to be poop.

338
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,769
Speaker 1: I ain't going to do shit.

339
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,330
Speaker 1: Right.

340
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,210
Speaker 1: Google Wave, I think, is going to change everything.

341
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,847
Speaker 0: Well, here's the main reason why it unlike other things that have high potential that never reach it.

342
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:15,190
Speaker 0: This is something that has potential that I alone can force it to reach even if no one else does.

343
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,589
Speaker 0: This is make it reach that potential for me.

344
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,601
Speaker 1: So I have, you know, I have a vision.

345
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:22,670
Speaker 1: You have a vision, a vision.

346
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,729
Speaker 0: We haven't had a vision in over a year.

347
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,570
Speaker 1: Here's my vision.

348
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:33,309
Speaker 1: So right now, the way the Internet and the Web's work right is where you put things up and they sort of stay there and then people get them.

349
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:34,049
Speaker 1: Right.

350
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:36,428
Speaker 1: But I think it's going to happen with the wave.

351
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:37,430
Speaker 1: Right.

352
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:44,410
Speaker 1: Is everyone is going to like make this like stream of shit like it's all these faucets.

353
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,046
Speaker 1: Right.

354
00:15:45,430 --> 00:16:13,330
Speaker 1: So it's like basically it's the Web, but with kinetic energy, everything is moving all the time, you know, and then you'll sort of everyone will also be sort of in addition to, you know, spitting out materials constantly, you know, streaming such there will also be many, many ways of filtering and funneling and sifting said, you know, you know, waterfalls into, you know, different streams for the viewing.

355
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,189
Speaker 1: And I think that is where we are headed from where we are now.

356
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,390
Speaker 1: So it's going to be like, you know, like Twitter.

357
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:19,669
Speaker 1: Right.

358
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,509
Speaker 1: It's just one hundred and forty characters of text.

359
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:28,606
Speaker 1: Think like Twitter times a billion and also not just text, also video and everything in the world.

360
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:31,130
Speaker 1: Well, audio and pictures and everything.

361
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,470
Speaker 0: There's so much potential.

362
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:42,770
Speaker 0: And like, if nothing else, like I could see using this for collaboration on like role playing games, geek nights, collaboration, us planning episodes.

363
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:46,450
Speaker 0: I could even see sharing a wave if we were doing teleconferencing.

364
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:51,946
Speaker 0: Say we do like three different people do a geek nights episode and we share a wave while we're doing it.

365
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,816
Speaker 1: Imagine if there was like that.

366
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:59,665
Speaker 1: somehow integrate like the wave and some Skype or maybe some go to meeting or maybe some WebEx.

367
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,328
Speaker 0: This is the end of WebEx.

368
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,630
Speaker 0: If I get this thing going the way I expect, I can get it going.

369
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,327
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I can just keep thinking of I think what's going to happen.

370
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:11,170
Speaker 1: also right is that people a lot of there are a lot of protocols out there.

371
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,910
Speaker 1: Twitter API, XMPP, Jabber, email, you know, YouTube, right.

372
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,250
Speaker 1: A lot of these protocols underlying things.

373
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:26,490
Speaker 1: I think a lot of existing applications are going to be able to use wave as the back end protocol.

374
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:31,807
Speaker 1: And as a result, it's going to, you know, sort of achieve what XMPP was supposed to achieve.

375
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:32,090
Speaker 1: Right.

376
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,638
Speaker 1: It's just not enough.

377
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:33,348
Speaker 1: people are using it.

378
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,810
Speaker 1: Like imagine, you know, it's I am you can have an IM client.

379
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,390
Speaker 1: It works exactly like every other IM client does today.

380
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,109
Speaker 1: You don't even notice.

381
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:49,708
Speaker 1: But instead of all the messages going over XMPP or AOL or whatever, they're going through some wave somewhere, you know, and that, you know, from your point of view, it doesn't matter.

382
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,050
Speaker 1: You're just using your IM client.

383
00:17:51,451 --> 00:18:00,030
Speaker 1: But because it's wave powered, all this shit is going on in the back and it's totally awesome and apply that to like anything and everything.

384
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:06,648
Speaker 0: It allows this kind of constant sideband communication that is so much more full feature than anything we have now.

385
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:09,297
Speaker 1: It's it I'm going to like.

386
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:12,650
Speaker 1: totally make so many JPEGs for wave things.

387
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,787
Speaker 1: You have no idea.

388
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:15,790
Speaker 0: We didn't even tell that story.

389
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,830
Speaker 0: We should say we're going to save that story to save that.

390
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,230
Speaker 0: But there's always it to say you can you can solve any problem with a JPEG.

391
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,709
Speaker 1: But I want to reiterate, actually, the tweet this weekend was like the best tweet I think possibly ever.

392
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:28,248
Speaker 0: Really?

393
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, really listen to it.

394
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:29,828
Speaker 0: Yeah.

395
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,929
Speaker 0: They talk about the wave.

396
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:32,290
Speaker 1: They talk about the wave.

397
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,449
Speaker 1: Some hey, by the way, one thing that they pointed out that I thought was like the most insightful thing.

398
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:41,477
Speaker 1: It's sort of something, you know, but you don't know it until someone says it right is you?

399
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,570
Speaker 1: look look at right now.

400
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,330
Speaker 1: I got the Bing we just talked about.

401
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,438
Speaker 1: Right.

402
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,170
Speaker 1: What does Microsoft do?

403
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,029
Speaker 1: They make being a product for you to use.

404
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:50,110
Speaker 1: What is Google?

405
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,509
Speaker 1: They make a platform upon for which you to build.

406
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:55,749
Speaker 0: That was quite a sentence.

407
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,904
Speaker 1: I know, wasn't it?

408
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:57,570
Speaker 1: Right.

409
00:18:58,035 --> 00:18:58,970
Speaker 1: So and look right.

410
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:02,290
Speaker 1: I mean, the wave is made by the Google Maps guys.

411
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:02,790
Speaker 1: Right.

412
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,702
Speaker 1: Perhaps Google's second most successful, third most successful thing after search and Gmail.

413
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,009
Speaker 0: I was about to say Gmail.

414
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,930
Speaker 1: It's of course, they're actually maps is sort of equal to Gmail.

415
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,849
Speaker 1: Maybe it even beats it.

416
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:13,309
Speaker 1: I don't know.

417
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:13,581
Speaker 1: Yeah.

418
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:20,710
Speaker 0: But well, the thing is, the only reason I don't rank Google Maps as high as it could be is that it still doesn't have good driving directions compared to MapQuest.

419
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,170
Speaker 1: That's true.

420
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:23,950
Speaker 1: But the actual rest of it is perfect.

421
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:24,310
Speaker 1: Right.

422
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,989
Speaker 0: I use the Google Maps guys.

423
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:34,350
Speaker 1: They made they made the wave and they talked about how the best time in their lives was like an 05 when everyone was making Google Maps mashups.

424
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:35,556
Speaker 1: So now they're just.

425
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:38,189
Speaker 1: they're going to be so thrilled that everyone's making the wave mashups.

426
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,230
Speaker 1: It's going to be like the new best time in their lives.

427
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:42,750
Speaker 1: One other thing I want to say, I think it's kind of scary.

428
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,750
Speaker 1: They called it the wave because not only is wave a good metaphor.

429
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,389
Speaker 0: It's also the name of a great movie.

430
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:48,588
Speaker 1: It's also the movie.

431
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,949
Speaker 0: I was going to make a which is very relevant.

432
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,109
Speaker 0: I can't believe you beat me to the wave joke.

433
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:56,550
Speaker 1: It's obvious.

434
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,749
Speaker 0: Maybe I should use the book for that as the book club.

435
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:01,630
Speaker 1: I didn't know there was a book for that.

436
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,348
Speaker 1: It was based on their TV movie.

437
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,169
Speaker 0: That was that's the movie you're thinking of.

438
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,550
Speaker 1: But I think I went on IMDB looking for it, actually.

439
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,250
Speaker 0: And they remade it in 2008.

440
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,485
Speaker 1: Yes.

441
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:10,608
Speaker 1: What the fuck's up with that?

442
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:11,468
Speaker 0: I didn't watch it.

443
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:12,850
Speaker 0: Let's let's look out the remake.

444
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:14,189
Speaker 0: I'm curious what the deal is with that.

445
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:17,649
Speaker 1: I will have to do some more research on the wave, but watch out.

446
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,929
Speaker 1: Watch out for the wave.

447
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,390
Speaker 1: It's going to blow you over.

448
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,930
Speaker 1: You'll drown if you don't swim.

449
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:23,790
Speaker 1: Maybe get a surfboard.

450
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,170
Speaker 1: I'm getting a surfboard in advance.

451
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:25,769
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing.

452
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:32,225
Speaker 0: So speaking of surfboards, the Palm Pre, which we talked about.

453
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:33,228
Speaker 0: how this is?

454
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,810
Speaker 0: this is make or break for spring.

455
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,569
Speaker 0: This is make or break for Paul.

456
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,508
Speaker 1: Actually, Verizon made a dick move.

457
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:39,150
Speaker 0: Right.

458
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,030
Speaker 1: Basically, they're exclusive to Sprint for six months.

459
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,303
Speaker 0: Yeah.

460
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,229
Speaker 1: So Verizon is pretty much like, yeah, we have that shit in six months.

461
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,229
Speaker 1: Basically, in January, you know, there's going to be a Verizon Pre.

462
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:48,889
Speaker 1: I know.

463
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,425
Speaker 1: Guaranteed.

464
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,190
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like this dick move because like, sure.

465
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,050
Speaker 1: OK, dick over Sprint.

466
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,810
Speaker 1: I don't really care.

467
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:55,127
Speaker 1: Right.

468
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:58,869
Speaker 1: But basically, Palm just needs to sell as many pre's as they can.

469
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,570
Speaker 1: See, at the same time, people are holding out until January.

470
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,049
Speaker 1: That's going to hurt Palm big time.

471
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,349
Speaker 0: At the same time, if they if they do it this way, here's my guess.

472
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,243
Speaker 0: Paul.

473
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:08,750
Speaker 0: Paul might be brilliant.

474
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:14,650
Speaker 0: They might have let Sprint pay out of its asshole for the rights to the six month exclusive.

475
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,250
Speaker 0: And simultaneously, they didn't make that many.

476
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:21,910
Speaker 0: And they pushed the schedule and just, you know, they put it as early as they could.

477
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:23,350
Speaker 0: And they only made enough.

478
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:26,170
Speaker 1: Palm wants to sell as many as they can.

479
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,388
Speaker 1: They don't care who the fucking carrier.

480
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,350
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

481
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,310
Speaker 0: You only make enough now so you can have the release early.

482
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:39,329
Speaker 0: But when you're actually going to have enough to sell is six months later and you now get to release hypes at six month intervals.

483
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,810
Speaker 0: Maybe so it'll get the hype when it comes out the height.

484
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,789
Speaker 1: The second hype will probably just be when there's a big software update that makes significant change.

485
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,021
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, the second hype could be the Verizon hype.

486
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:54,570
Speaker 1: if because remember, they're time the firmware update with the Verizon release, that would be big.

487
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,730
Speaker 0: They're leaving out one feature that they could.

488
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,990
Speaker 0: They have probably already got this feature and they're leaving it out only to add it at the six month interval.

489
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:04,890
Speaker 0: This is my totally, you know, pulling out of nowhere guess.

490
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:07,650
Speaker 0: Visual voicemail is not part of the initial release.

491
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:08,688
Speaker 1: Oh, they're going to add that in.

492
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:09,130
Speaker 0: Yes.

493
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,199
Speaker 1: But that's not.

494
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,430
Speaker 1: that's not a huge deal, though.

495
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:11,875
Speaker 1: That's not.

496
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,069
Speaker 1: it's not like a game changer.

497
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,129
Speaker 1: It's it's cool, but it's not a game changer for me.

498
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:19,910
Speaker 0: It is like visual voicemail is something that's pretty awesome.

499
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,570
Speaker 0: Because I don't listen to my voicemail ever.

500
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,230
Speaker 1: I know, right.

501
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,030
Speaker 1: Like I hate I love the visual voicemail.

502
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,970
Speaker 1: I'm not knocking it, but it's like, you know, it's not.

503
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,610
Speaker 1: No, but it's big, but it's not super big.

504
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:39,830
Speaker 0: If I were Palm, I would have done this and I would I would release the firmware update for a visual voicemail the same day that it is available for Verizon.

505
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,589
Speaker 1: It's a good idea.

506
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:45,809
Speaker 1: Maybe two days before I say, hey, you got to have some other features in that firmware update, though, to get the big hype.

507
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:48,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's got to be features that no one else has.

508
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,017
Speaker 0: But there is a lot of new.

509
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,610
Speaker 0: I mean, normally I would talk about the pre after.

510
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,030
Speaker 0: And the only reason I care is that I didn't buy the Android or the iPhone.

511
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:58,090
Speaker 0: This is this is the third one.

512
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,449
Speaker 0: If I don't buy this one, I'm going to have to buy one of the other two because I need a smartphone.

513
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,170
Speaker 0: It is I can't go any longer without a smartphone.

514
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,026
Speaker 0: I need it now.

515
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:09,310
Speaker 1: You're not going to continue your plan of waiting for the perfect thing.

516
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:10,510
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

517
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:23,210
Speaker 0: I might still wait, but the pre is almost there because the news that came out a little while ago is that supposedly it will synchronize with iTunes and not just synchronize because you can use other MP3 players with iTunes.

518
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,529
Speaker 0: Supposedly, I will be able to synchronize it with iTunes as though it were an iPod with all the features.

519
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,566
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll have all the features, because, see, the thing is, yeah, it might not have one.

520
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,785
Speaker 0: It won't have the old DRM.

521
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,050
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

522
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,788
Speaker 0: I don't care about that.

523
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:37,569
Speaker 1: No, who cares?

524
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:43,410
Speaker 0: And it might not have the play pause play again between all my devices.

525
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,029
Speaker 0: Exactly.

526
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:48,330
Speaker 0: But it might, because supposedly the story is they got old Apple engineers.

527
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,630
Speaker 1: Well, I'll tell you what, the guy who the guy who made it was in charge of the pre was the guy who pretty much, quote, invented the iPod.

528
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:56,649
Speaker 1: He was like that the hardware lead at Apple.

529
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,050
Speaker 0: But Paul basically came out and said, yeah, we pretty much reverse engineered it.

530
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,549
Speaker 0: And as far as anyone can tell, it pretends to be like a generation four iPod in all respect.

531
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,470
Speaker 1: Let me steal from another podcast.

532
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,930
Speaker 1: I'll steal from the GDGT podcast this time, which I also listen to today.

533
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:11,370
Speaker 1: Right.

534
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:15,930
Speaker 1: Basically, what's going to happen here is Palm stole all these Apple people.

535
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,170
Speaker 1: They come out with this phone that synchronizes with iTunes.

536
00:24:20,316 --> 00:24:20,530
Speaker 1: Right.

537
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,610
Speaker 1: So obviously there's some sort of legal thing going on here, right?

538
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,429
Speaker 0: Well, here's well, two things.

539
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:33,710
Speaker 0: My reading of this is that one palm probably has a patent portfolio, the likes of which Apple also has a patent portfolio.

540
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:37,070
Speaker 0: Two companies have equally deadly patent portfolios.

541
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,068
Speaker 0: The only thing that comes out of that is an automatic license.

542
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,870
Speaker 1: Here's the thinking that the GDGT guys came up with a second thinking.

543
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:49,289
Speaker 1: Their thinking is that Apple's like, we're going to get you.

544
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,529
Speaker 1: And Palm is like, bring it.

545
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:59,269
Speaker 1: Because what's going to happen, right, is if Apple brings it, Palm is going to be like, you know, oh, look, you know, they're afraid of competition.

546
00:24:59,370 --> 00:24:59,664
Speaker 1: Yeah.

547
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,210
Speaker 1: They got to bring us down with the law because they can't beat us by making something better.

548
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:03,854
Speaker 1: Yeah.

549
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:05,999
Speaker 1: And it's going to be a big.

550
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,110
Speaker 1: it's going to be a big searing bond.

551
00:25:08,572 --> 00:25:13,421
Speaker 0: If Palm were if Palm and Sprint were really brilliant, like and there's no way this is true.

552
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,132
Speaker 0: This is my.

553
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:18,110
Speaker 0: if I were them, what I would have done is set this up to fail.

554
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:27,050
Speaker 0: And as soon as Apple goes after me and I'd even make it to where Apple can trivially go after me, what I would do is then say, all right, have a big press release.

555
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,470
Speaker 0: Be like, look, Apple won't let us sing to the iTunes store.

556
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,470
Speaker 1: Like what Amazon did to the book people?

557
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:39,070
Speaker 0: Well, I would say here is our store and anyone can sell on it and set any prices they want.

558
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:42,330
Speaker 0: And I would I mean, there are all the details.

559
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:43,909
Speaker 1: That's a little bit out there.

560
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,809
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, you wouldn't.

561
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,390
Speaker 1: And it's not see what it is, really.

562
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:49,150
Speaker 1: It's not about the store, really.

563
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,850
Speaker 1: What it is, is that people manage their media.

564
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,114
Speaker 1: Right.

565
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,950
Speaker 1: Mostly with iTunes is the most popular one.

566
00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:05,588
Speaker 1: And the problem with selling anyone a new portable music device like a Zune or something is that it's a pain in the ass to switch what desktop program using to manage your media library.

567
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:11,150
Speaker 1: So allowing people to continue to use iTunes to manage their media library is a huge boost.

568
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:18,550
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just the difficulty of switching to something else is what keeps a lot of people from switching away from iPod, partially myself included.

569
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:18,987
Speaker 1: Yeah.

570
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:20,630
Speaker 0: So I mean, there's more here.

571
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,768
Speaker 0: I don't think Apple is going to go after him in the end.

572
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:24,068
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't think so?

573
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:24,829
Speaker 0: Well, here's the reasons.

574
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:30,130
Speaker 0: One patent portfolio, Palm and Apple can fuck each other to death with their patents.

575
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:35,490
Speaker 0: And while Apple could take Palm down, they would take a serious beating, I think, in the patent.

576
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:43,150
Speaker 0: I think that basically to Apple, while they make a ton of money with their markups on their hardware, they also make money on the iTunes store.

577
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:47,269
Speaker 0: And if this thing can buy stuff from the iTunes store.

578
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,130
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

579
00:26:48,332 --> 00:26:50,210
Speaker 1: You can buy stuff from the iTunes store and put it on.

580
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,350
Speaker 0: Apple's going to make its money.

581
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,629
Speaker 1: It's not DRM free.

582
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:53,530
Speaker 1: Oh, it's true.

583
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,150
Speaker 1: Apple should be sort of happy with that.

584
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,730
Speaker 1: That's maybe that's what Palm will come back.

585
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:04,950
Speaker 1: Yes, because the other day, you know, music people, Apple is like, you know, we made a device that's very popular and people are buying music from you to put on our.

586
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:05,327
Speaker 0: Yeah.

587
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:07,090
Speaker 1: And that's that's a good one.

588
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,030
Speaker 0: That is what brings me to my third reason Apple is not going to attack them.

589
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:17,090
Speaker 0: If Apple brings them down, everyone else now has a lot more standing for antitrust against Apple.

590
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,156
Speaker 1: Well, it's always like.

591
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,229
Speaker 1: I think what basically what's going to happen is you're going to see lawyers on all the three sides.

592
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:26,870
Speaker 1: Basically, they're going to mill for a whole bunch of months, maybe six to 12 months.

593
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,230
Speaker 1: Right.

594
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:32,882
Speaker 1: Until each set of lawyers figures out the perfect attack plan and then they're going to execute.

595
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:34,889
Speaker 0: I don't think Apple is going to attack.

596
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:38,969
Speaker 1: I think they will if their lawyers figure out something that they know is a lock.

597
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,750
Speaker 1: You know, they're not going to go into it.

598
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,807
Speaker 1: They're not going to rush in.

599
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,110
Speaker 1: They're going to wait to the perfect legal strategy.

600
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:53,450
Speaker 0: It is my guess that Apple's lawyers are going to realize that Palm's portfolio, because Palm was making PDAs when PDAs mattered.

601
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,970
Speaker 0: Palm is just like this.

602
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,810
Speaker 0: They have so many crazy patents for obvious things that they're just keeping.

603
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,970
Speaker 0: I'm sure they've got this gigantic secret portfolio of doom.

604
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,430
Speaker 0: Just right.

605
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,930
Speaker 1: There's a big chess game going on.

606
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,396
Speaker 1: It's it's.

607
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:07,388
Speaker 1: it's just fun for us.

608
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:07,804
Speaker 0: Yep.

609
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,117
Speaker 1: Yeah.

610
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,550
Speaker 0: And but the PRI, I can't talk a lot about it other than that.

611
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,810
Speaker 1: All because we've never seen one, nor does barely anyone.

612
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:32,469
Speaker 0: All of the initial reviews I see are that the multi touch screen is as good or so close that it doesn't matter to being as good as the iPhone and it has gestures at the bottom separate from the screen.

613
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:34,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's really cool.

614
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,190
Speaker 0: Like I saw a video of how that works.

615
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,089
Speaker 1: I saw that it's pretty good.

616
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,490
Speaker 0: Leaves like that trail where you move your fingers.

617
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:39,747
Speaker 0: I really like that.

618
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:42,049
Speaker 0: It's got a real keyboard.

619
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:42,807
Speaker 1: Yep.

620
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,228
Speaker 0: That is like killer for me.

621
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:51,230
Speaker 0: And while people who have touched it said the keyboard sucks, those people qualify that by saying that it's about as good as a Blackberry keyboard.

622
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's like very fine.

623
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,670
Speaker 1: A keyboard, you know, no mobile keyboard is great.

624
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:02,010
Speaker 1: You know, like maybe some of them are, you know, but a keyboard is better than no keyboard.

625
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:02,390
Speaker 1: You know what?

626
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:09,870
Speaker 0: Because I looked at the kind of keyboard they use and I went to a Verizon store and found a keyboard that has a similar keyboard, a similar phone.

627
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:10,889
Speaker 0: It's not the same.

628
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:12,910
Speaker 0: It was bigger and it wasn't the same thing.

629
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:19,170
Speaker 0: But I tried it and I realized everyone who has problems with the with this keyboard either has really, really fat thumbs.

630
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:19,849
Speaker 1: A lot of people.

631
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,767
Speaker 0: Or they cut their fingernails too short because I realized that I type with my fingernails on phones.

632
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:25,365
Speaker 0: Really?

633
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:25,796
Speaker 0: Yeah.

634
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:27,190
Speaker 0: And you know what?

635
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:33,669
Speaker 0: Because this is a givey plastic thing instead of a solid plastic thing, I think I'll be able to type lightning fast.

636
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:38,170
Speaker 1: No, it's definitely better than the onscreen keyboard, that's for sure.

637
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,710
Speaker 0: I guess my my guess is that maybe the new iPhone will have the keyboard.

638
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:49,550
Speaker 0: Maybe the only other complaint I see people saying is that this thing is way too light, which that's not a complaint.

639
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:50,109
Speaker 1: No.

640
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,528
Speaker 0: So I am probably going to buy one unless the thing is what you could do is just get one, right?

641
00:29:57,092 --> 00:30:00,690
Speaker 1: And if it sucks, you can just you have 30 days to just bail.

642
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:02,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's usually how that thing works.

643
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,970
Speaker 0: The thing is, I looked by Verizon contract ends on the 20th of this month.

644
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:07,568
Speaker 1: All right.

645
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:10,809
Speaker 0: So I got to wait until the end of the month.

646
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,748
Speaker 1: Waiting is fun.

647
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:17,970
Speaker 0: Which is fine, because that'll give me enough time for the Internet to point out, like, oh, you'll also want to do any stupid lines, probably.

648
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:18,264
Speaker 1: Yep.

649
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,290
Speaker 0: However, I have some secret radio checks.

650
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:20,976
Speaker 0: Remember, you have to.

651
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:22,190
Speaker 0: it's not two hundred dollars.

652
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:24,550
Speaker 0: It's like four hundred dollars or five hundred.

653
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,450
Speaker 0: And then you got a rebate.

654
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:29,769
Speaker 0: Best Buy and Radio Shack will give you the rebate at the store right then.

655
00:30:30,231 --> 00:30:34,490
Speaker 1: Oh, and I know that in New York City that those Best Buy mobile stores.

656
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:35,669
Speaker 1: Yes, those are good.

657
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:39,748
Speaker 0: And there are like five places within walking distance of my work that will have it.

658
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,709
Speaker 0: So I might just get it and get a new phone number.

659
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:43,970
Speaker 0: I don't know.

660
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:44,769
Speaker 1: I wouldn't do that.

661
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:45,508
Speaker 1: I would wait it out.

662
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:46,088
Speaker 0: I might.

663
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:46,688
Speaker 1: It's a lie.

664
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,690
Speaker 1: It's, you know, a pain in the ass to changing a phone number versus what most a month.

665
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,586
Speaker 0: The other option is waiting for the Verizon plan.

666
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,350
Speaker 1: Not a bad idea either.

667
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,570
Speaker 0: But I kind of want to switch to the Sprint plan because for what I would get, it looks like it's a lot cheaper.

668
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,550
Speaker 1: I mean, if you if you're not going if you're only in place, you know, Sprint, you know, is that is not the greatest.

669
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:17,850
Speaker 0: I would argue having had a Sprint phone forever until relatively recently when I switched to Verizon, Sprint had a great network and good prices and terrible customer service.

670
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:20,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, but their network, you know, is fast.

671
00:31:21,732 --> 00:31:23,266
Speaker 0: And I mean, this thing is, you know, it's 3G.

672
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,668
Speaker 0: It's Avdo Revision A.

673
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:26,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not it's not bad.

674
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:27,650
Speaker 1: And it works.

675
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:33,450
Speaker 0: And the coverage is good enough in places where we are and never run into a problem with Sprint coverage in my entire life.

676
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,430
Speaker 1: You know, and they have one hundred dollars for the unlimited everything.

677
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:43,050
Speaker 0: It's 70 bucks for effectively the unlimited everything, because the only thing you lose there is you only get like 400 minutes of talking.

678
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,202
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I used that's like.

679
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:46,330
Speaker 1: that's like what I have my iPhone.

680
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,890
Speaker 1: The thing is, it actually comes out to ninety dollars after all the bullshit fees I used.

681
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:51,949
Speaker 0: I think 19 minutes last month.

682
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:54,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't use any minutes.

683
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:54,686
Speaker 1: All right.

684
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:56,070
Speaker 0: Plus multitasking.

685
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:56,528
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

686
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,648
Speaker 1: Anyway, OK, that's there's a whole million more tech news that we don't have time to discuss.

687
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:13,240
Speaker 0: We'll save them for later, because it is time for things of the day.

688
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,479
Speaker 0: What do you got for me, Scott?

689
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:25,498
Speaker 1: This isn't an awesome thing like most people would be expecting, like a funny video or some such as a piece of software called DNS mask, DNS, M.A.S.

690
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:26,599
Speaker 1: Q. Right.

691
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:30,000
Speaker 1: And what this is is I wish I would have discovered it earlier.

692
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:30,419
Speaker 1: Right.

693
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:36,120
Speaker 1: It's a DNS server, but it's also a DHCP server and it's also a TFTP server.

694
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,553
Speaker 1: Right.

695
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:42,840
Speaker 1: So, you know, if you've got, say, a small home network.

696
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:43,580
Speaker 1: Right.

697
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:58,250
Speaker 1: And you want to like, you know, give your computers names like so that you can do stuff like SSH space name of computer in the living room or as our paying space name of computer in the bedroom of situations of I.T.

698
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,233
Speaker 0: person versus C.S.

699
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:05,680
Speaker 0: person solving a problem or expert in a field versus expert in another field who just wants to make the field.

700
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,879
Speaker 0: They're not an expert in work as they can do their real work.

701
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:08,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

702
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:14,020
Speaker 1: Or if you want to like, you know, have some local DNS caching, you know, because the other DNS servers are not trustworthy.

703
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,180
Speaker 0: Scott comes to me and he's like, how do I do this?

704
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,620
Speaker 0: How do I just have like a local DNS?

705
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,199
Speaker 0: That was like just run bind locally and make a config.

706
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:20,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,480
Speaker 1: Run the gigantic DNS server of full power with one hundred configuration files.

708
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,900
Speaker 0: Thing is bind as one tiny configuration file and it's actually tiny.

709
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:31,308
Speaker 0: Yeah.

710
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,600
Speaker 1: Well, this is pretty much your answer here.

711
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:35,544
Speaker 0: C.S.

712
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:37,351
Speaker 0: guy just wrote something that does what bind does.

713
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:48,820
Speaker 1: the best thing about the DNS mask is that, you know, it's mainly designed for a small home network with Nat, you know, to run everything on the inside of the net in terms of DNS, DTP and such.

714
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:59,220
Speaker 1: But it is also very good to just install it on your computer and then you can use it to sort of give you DNS for all the virtual machines you're running.

715
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:11,139
Speaker 1: So if you're like a developer like me and you've got all these virtual machines, you can use this to sort of DNS all of them and you can do cool stuff like, you know, basically it's basically gives you a host file on cracks.

716
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:20,040
Speaker 1: You can do stuff like star dot whatever and point every possible sub domain at the same IP address, which is very, very helpful.

717
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:27,860
Speaker 1: If you're doing like a virtual machine with virtual hosts, you know, if you understand what I'm saying, then you will understand why this is useful to you.

718
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,880
Speaker 1: If you don't understand what I'm talking about, then you have no interest in this.

719
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:37,080
Speaker 1: Then there's no point in you figuring what I will say, though, because it's already not useful to you if you don't know what I'm talking about.

720
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:44,558
Speaker 0: If you were in college and you think that you can use this instead of buying for DNS, you're wrong.

721
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:46,764
Speaker 1: It's not.

722
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,760
Speaker 1: it's not a real DNS server replacement.

723
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,659
Speaker 1: It's meant for, you know, a small home network or an individual computer.

724
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,440
Speaker 0: Just, you know, this is a tool that fixes an IT problem for a developer.

725
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,345
Speaker 0: This is not.

726
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:59,020
Speaker 0: this is not solve your DNS problem.

727
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:00,820
Speaker 1: If you have a home network, it's good.

728
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,682
Speaker 1: It does not.

729
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:04,659
Speaker 1: it's not good if you have a real network is very bad.

730
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:13,257
Speaker 0: So the wrong door, as far as I can tell, do these skits, you know, funny humor sketches that involve a lot of CG.

731
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:19,420
Speaker 0: And I found this one pretty amusing and it reminded me of Dave and Joel because it involves dinosaurs.

732
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:21,063
Speaker 0: It's just.

733
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:25,520
Speaker 0: I think they're parodying some either some generic show or maybe there's a specific show in Britain.

734
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,960
Speaker 0: They're parodying Albion.

735
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,938
Speaker 0: I'm sorry, I'm not sure.

736
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:31,880
Speaker 0: But it is just a typical, you know, guy and girl.

737
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:37,899
Speaker 0: The girl is breaking up with the guy in the short term and then has a flashback montage of all the good times they had together.

738
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:42,940
Speaker 0: But it's a velociraptor or a baby T-Rex or something like that.

739
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,660
Speaker 0: And I found this incredibly funny.

740
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:45,899
Speaker 1: I didn't think it was that funny.

741
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,840
Speaker 0: Scott doesn't find anything funny that is not immediately blisteringly funny.

742
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,100
Speaker 0: Like if a YouTube video is 20 seconds long, he's skipping to the end to see what happens.

743
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:57,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found this wasn't funny in any part.

744
00:35:58,306 --> 00:35:58,838
Speaker 0: I think it was.

745
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,550
Speaker 1: I don't think it was.

746
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,779
Speaker 0: Listeners, what do you think?

747
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,420
Speaker 0: Was that funny?

748
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,420
Speaker 1: Oh, they're easily amused.

749
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,238
Speaker 1: They think we're funny.

750
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,099
Speaker 0: I see you've taken a page from the pendulate self-deprecating humor at all turns.

751
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:10,985
Speaker 1: I learned from.

752
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:12,599
Speaker 1: I steal from the forgotten masters.

753
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,440
Speaker 0: Penn's forgotten?

754
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,154
Speaker 1: Yes.

755
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,060
Speaker 0: So how do you document things?

756
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,440
Speaker 0: This is not a trivial question, sadly.

757
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically I want to do a little.

758
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:33,979
Speaker 1: see we're going to do a series of shows here because there is sort of like this suite of applications that businesses need these days, especially businesses with tech people.

759
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:39,880
Speaker 1: And they sort of all they're all these separate tools that need some amount of integration with each other.

760
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:42,139
Speaker 1: And they're all related, but they're all so distinct.

761
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:58,880
Speaker 1: And those tools are the ticketing system, the project and task management system, the version control type systems.

762
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,959
Speaker 1: If you have some sort of code going on.

763
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:01,935
Speaker 0: Well, that's easy to get.

764
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:02,600
Speaker 1: Right.

765
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,560
Speaker 1: But, you know, so you've got all these these sort of things going on.

766
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:07,980
Speaker 0: Right.

767
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:18,640
Speaker 1: And we want to sort of spend a show on each one of these to talk about because basically they all so time tracking is also sort of in there with the project management bit.

768
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:20,299
Speaker 0: They all suck.

769
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,939
Speaker 1: There are no good ones out there.

770
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:28,418
Speaker 1: And we are constantly in our jobs dealing with bad ones, good ones, picking ones out, making ones.

771
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:31,380
Speaker 1: And it's just it's never perfect.

772
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:31,839
Speaker 1: Right.

773
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:35,840
Speaker 1: So we want to we want to dedicate some show time to these these pieces of software.

774
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:46,500
Speaker 0: I have four use cases, I guess, or four scenarios of me as an IT professional trying to have things be documented in any capacity.

775
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:54,060
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the first thing you got to talk about, though, is the difference between like software documentation from the developer side.

776
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,780
Speaker 0: Oh, crap.

777
00:37:55,741 --> 00:38:02,780
Speaker 0: I had a discussion like this with the developer not that long ago where I basically said, yeah, we need a system to document things.

778
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,200
Speaker 0: And you guys got to write documentation.

779
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,639
Speaker 0: You could probably put it in our Twiki.

780
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:09,140
Speaker 0: And the guys like for documentation, we use Doxygen.

781
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,020
Speaker 0: And I was like, that does not solve the problem I'm right.

782
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:13,199
Speaker 0: So any capacity.

783
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,499
Speaker 1: So for people who don't know.

784
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:14,671
Speaker 1: Right.

785
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:22,340
Speaker 1: And when you're writing software, right, you'll put comments in the code, which is just like notes that don't actually do anything like this for loop doesn't do anything.

786
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:22,771
Speaker 1: Yeah.

787
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,589
Speaker 1: You just write in the middle of your code words that explain the code and help you understand it.

788
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:47,099
Speaker 1: So what people will do is they'll sort of have these documentation systems where in front of every function, in front of every class, you will put comments in some particular format and then you'll run some program that will generate sort of websites that, you know, document the code.

789
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,620
Speaker 1: So, you know, if I have a class, you know, and I can I write what the class does and I wrote the arguments to all the functions are.

790
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:56,580
Speaker 1: And then I put the comments in the file and I push a button.

791
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:58,100
Speaker 1: And then there's a website.

792
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:07,938
Speaker 1: So someone else who wants to say work on my source code or integrate with it right can just go to that website and it explains the code so that they don't accept to look at the code.

793
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:12,160
Speaker 1: All the information they need is sort of like the interface, the API parts.

794
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,400
Speaker 1: So that is what that's one kind of documentation.

795
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:21,720
Speaker 1: But systems for that kind of documentation are actually very prevalent.

796
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,920
Speaker 1: And there's quite a few good ones out there.

797
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,640
Speaker 1: And it varies by language and such.

798
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:32,175
Speaker 1: The thing is, a lot of people don't you know, it takes a really good people actually use them.

799
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:40,740
Speaker 1: I mean, I haven't actually gotten into a place that uses it fully and properly since I was in college and we used it in college.

800
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:44,870
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's one of those things where it's like on paper, you know, you should do it.

801
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:46,259
Speaker 1: Some people do do it.

802
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:55,074
Speaker 1: I've never done it just because, you know, you never do things that you know that you only know there's a right way to do things, but you never actually end up doing it that way.

803
00:39:55,348 --> 00:39:55,518
Speaker 0: Yeah.

804
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:03,899
Speaker 0: Just because the realities of the world, 99 percent of these scripts I've written in the course of my professional career to do something on a server for me.

805
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:07,960
Speaker 0: They if you put the wrong argument in, it'll just crash and there's no error handling.

806
00:40:08,102 --> 00:40:08,292
Speaker 1: Yeah.

807
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:09,380
Speaker 1: Anyway.

808
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:16,000
Speaker 0: But my four cases are first at RIT doing IT projects with other students for grades.

809
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:21,360
Speaker 0: We took notes on pieces of paper and we handed these scribbled documents into professors.

810
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:22,879
Speaker 0: We never referred to them.

811
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,279
Speaker 0: We didn't document anything.

812
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:25,770
Speaker 0: IBM.

813
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,420
Speaker 0: Everyone there was actually pretty smart.

814
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,120
Speaker 0: They had a documentation server.

815
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:33,037
Speaker 0: It was just a Windows box running IIS.

816
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:34,540
Speaker 0: All right.

817
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,300
Speaker 0: And you just made documentation in HTML or text and you put it up there and then you added it to this hierarchy.

818
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,440
Speaker 0: It was basically the equivalent of a file server.

819
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,799
Speaker 0: It was a file server, but it served the purpose of a wiki.

820
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:53,596
Speaker 0: It wasn't a good way to go about it, but it kind of encouraged this sort of.

821
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:59,380
Speaker 0: you put up complete awesome documentation as opposed to half as barely finished documentation.

822
00:41:01,004 --> 00:41:03,159
Speaker 0: Then I worked at Emerging Health, the hospital thing.

823
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,520
Speaker 0: There was no documentation for anything anywhere.

824
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:07,039
Speaker 1: So how did you know how things worked?

825
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:08,339
Speaker 0: I would have to ask people.

826
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:08,880
Speaker 1: Okay.

827
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:15,519
Speaker 0: And then I would write documentation for myself, which became one of the most sought after commodities in the history of that company.

828
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:23,780
Speaker 0: And the problem there, though, was that I kept saying, we need a wiki, we need a wiki, we need a wiki, we need a documentation server, we need something.

829
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,980
Speaker 0: And they always said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

830
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:26,479
Speaker 0: And then I quit.

831
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:36,879
Speaker 0: And then where I work now, we had a Twiki wiki, which media wiki seems to be the popular wiki among people who want to set up a wiki.

832
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,319
Speaker 1: The fact is that all wikis suck.

833
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,200
Speaker 0: They all suck.

834
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,779
Speaker 0: Good God, every wiki sucks.

835
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,500
Speaker 0: Google's is probably the least shitty, but it still has its problems.

836
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're all terrible.

837
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,159
Speaker 0: Most people seem to know media wiki and use it because it has a lot of extensions and features.

838
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,400
Speaker 0: Twiki seems to be used primarily by enterprise people.

839
00:41:53,923 --> 00:41:57,300
Speaker 0: I think Twiki is better in the ways that matter.

840
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,660
Speaker 0: But media wiki is still good.

841
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,700
Speaker 0: I think they're equal, but different.

842
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:09,840
Speaker 0: And theoretically, a wiki seems to solve the documentation problem because people just write all of their documentation and the structure of the wiki just emerges if everyone's smart.

843
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,791
Speaker 1: I mean, in my last company, you know, we knew documentation was the way to go and we wanted it.

844
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:18,400
Speaker 1: We just we never actually wrote enough of it, but we did set up a docu wiki.

845
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,340
Speaker 1: It was actually a wiki for documentation called docu wiki.

846
00:42:21,844 --> 00:42:23,540
Speaker 1: It wasn't amazing by any means.

847
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,360
Speaker 1: You know, it was sort of an average wiki, but it was meant for documentation.

848
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:37,980
Speaker 1: And it had, you know, some good versioning type features and such like that, which is good, you know, and we wrote some documentation in it, but, you know, we didn't write enough and now they're out of business.

849
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:45,619
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the problem I really found is that it's really easy to get technical people to write documentation as long as you give them time to do it.

850
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,260
Speaker 0: Project managers seem to always forget that they need to allocate like 10 percent of a project to documentation and knowledge.

851
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:51,799
Speaker 1: That is true.

852
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,940
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, I could never write documentation because I always had to do work, you know.

853
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,230
Speaker 0: Yep.

854
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:05,320
Speaker 0: So if any of you are ever in a position to manage tech people did whatever your project is, give them 10 percent of the time for documentation and knowledge transfer.

855
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:08,780
Speaker 0: You will you will make the best projects ever.

856
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:17,060
Speaker 1: You'll also be easier to fire people and hire new people with more skills, but don't tell them that now because then they won't document.

857
00:43:17,502 --> 00:43:18,119
Speaker 1: Oh, they will.

858
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:23,240
Speaker 1: Maybe if they have the skills and they're and they're going to write if they have this, if they're writing good documentation.

859
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:23,547
Speaker 1: Right.

860
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,359
Speaker 1: Because they don't write good documentation is used.

861
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,678
Speaker 0: I knew a guy at IBM who purposefully did not write documentation so that he could not be fired.

862
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:30,859
Speaker 1: Ah, bad.

863
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,719
Speaker 0: That was his stated goal.

864
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,143
Speaker 1: Wow.

865
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,600
Speaker 1: I mean, I think that that's what he said to sound sort of smart and witty and clever.

866
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,026
Speaker 0: But really, that was really.

867
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,514
Speaker 1: he was lazy and didn't want to write.

868
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:41,840
Speaker 0: that was his goal.

869
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,999
Speaker 0: He he he would refuse to give me the answers I needed to write the program that was going to replace his job.

870
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:49,838
Speaker 0: And then I quit.

871
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:51,696
Speaker 1: OK.

872
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,860
Speaker 0: But the problem I've run into is that you need like it's not just tech stuff.

873
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,540
Speaker 0: If you just look at tech stuff, the documentation problem is pretty easy to handle.

874
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,700
Speaker 0: If it's just tech people writing tech documentation, you set up like a Twicky Wiki.

875
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,620
Speaker 0: You make a good skeleton structure of some kind.

876
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,060
Speaker 1: Like you make a hierarchy and tech people will be smart enough to make it work, even if it's the system is not perfect.

877
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,840
Speaker 0: But you need other people or documentation.

878
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,140
Speaker 1: You also need other people to read the documentation and be able to understand and such and such.

879
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,926
Speaker 0: And I don't want to like.

880
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,023
Speaker 0: basically I just want to point out that there's no good way to do this.

881
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:29,579
Speaker 0: that exists in any capacity as far as I can see.

882
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:29,793
Speaker 1: Yeah.

883
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,520
Speaker 1: Remember, you know, let's for a minute.

884
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:31,754
Speaker 1: Right.

885
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,500
Speaker 1: This documentation we're talking about, you know, it's not the software documentation.

886
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:36,245
Speaker 1: This is like.

887
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:38,320
Speaker 1: it's the business documentation.

888
00:44:38,481 --> 00:44:42,219
Speaker 1: Like, you know, for example, like this is the process for doing this.

889
00:44:42,902 --> 00:44:43,710
Speaker 1: You know, that's like.

890
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,840
Speaker 1: these are the steps you take.

891
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:47,520
Speaker 0: I want to get a new fixed connection for a customer.

892
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,318
Speaker 0: What are the processes?

893
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,740
Speaker 0: Or I want to get a new customer on our platform.

894
00:44:53,204 --> 00:44:54,180
Speaker 0: What are all the steps?

895
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,818
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like, you know, the user manuals for things to think about when you have a company, right?

896
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,840
Speaker 1: Let's you go to the store and you buy something.

897
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,140
Speaker 1: It comes with an instruction manual.

898
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:02,539
Speaker 1: Right.

899
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:06,500
Speaker 1: Well, companies have a lot of things that are specific to them.

900
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:06,838
Speaker 1: Right.

901
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,560
Speaker 1: You some guy makes a piece of software that is for internal use at your company.

902
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,879
Speaker 1: The only place that software ever be used is your company using it for itself.

903
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:17,960
Speaker 1: That needs an instruction manual.

904
00:45:18,322 --> 00:45:20,612
Speaker 1: So that's the kind of documentation we're talking about.

905
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:24,419
Speaker 1: is how do you use the systems and what's the network look like?

906
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:27,378
Speaker 1: You know what IP addresses are these things on?

907
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:34,807
Speaker 0: All that kind of thing that I really find interesting is that different groups seem to all across every company.

908
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:38,380
Speaker 0: I've seen document things the same wrong way.

909
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:46,460
Speaker 0: And it's always the scenario of if all you have is a hammer, you're you're nailing every goddamn thing into whatever you're trying to put it in that screw.

910
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,538
Speaker 1: Hit that screw real hard.

911
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:49,300
Speaker 0: Hit that carburetor.

912
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:49,853
Speaker 0: Make it go.

913
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:52,316
Speaker 1: You broke it.

914
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:57,800
Speaker 0: I mean, every HR department I've ever seen has a Samba share on some Windows server somewhere.

915
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:05,760
Speaker 0: And on that Samba share are all these word documents and PDFs explaining like or like scans of physical documents.

916
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:07,420
Speaker 1: That's better than a physical document.

917
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:15,040
Speaker 0: Yes, but they tell people, yeah, go to the D drive and on the D drive you will find a directory full of files that are named.

918
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,577
Speaker 1: And maybe if you use something like Google desktop or SharePoint, SharePoint is actually pretty good.

919
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,860
Speaker 1: SharePoint is getting better, but it's still not great.

920
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:31,620
Speaker 0: But the thing SharePoint does is you can have versioning of documents that is transparent in the file system, but only if you set it up right.

921
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:39,960
Speaker 1: Just people know SharePoint is Microsoft's solution to many of the things we are going to discuss in this series, but not enough of them for it to be the solution.

922
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:40,577
Speaker 1: Exactly.

923
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,919
Speaker 1: It's like it does some things.

924
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:43,299
Speaker 1: I've used it a couple of times.

925
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:48,400
Speaker 1: Some of the things it does are kind of slick and it's starting to go somewhere, but it's not complete.

926
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,399
Speaker 1: It leaves a lot of gaps.

927
00:46:49,782 --> 00:46:52,960
Speaker 1: So you still need to accommodate it with other things.

928
00:46:53,281 --> 00:46:58,820
Speaker 1: And when those things don't integrate, so it's like, fuck, there's also other popular solutions out there.

929
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,939
Speaker 1: Like Basecamp is a very popular solution to many of the things we're talking about here.

930
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:09,139
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's documentation is like these write boards and it's pretty sad.

931
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:10,079
Speaker 0: Yep.

932
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,163
Speaker 0: But what?

933
00:47:11,184 --> 00:47:14,196
Speaker 0: HR departments always seem to have slightly better documentation than everyone else.

934
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:22,099
Speaker 0: And I've noticed this because HR people tend to have been trained in so-called Microsoft Office Suite power usage.

935
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:30,059
Speaker 0: So they're the ones who make the crazy Excel spreadsheet that like auto calculates everything when you should have just hired someone to make a web app.

936
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,485
Speaker 1: Also, HR people, a lot of their job is procedures like how do you sign someone up for the health care?

937
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,740
Speaker 1: How do you hire a new employee?

938
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,860
Speaker 1: How do you fire a new employee?

939
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,819
Speaker 1: What do you do if someone quits?

940
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,300
Speaker 1: What do you do?

941
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,560
Speaker 1: Right.

942
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:45,400
Speaker 1: So all those procedures, they need to make sure they do those things fucking right now.

943
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,040
Speaker 1: And so they have, you know, procedural documents explaining every single step they need to take and every single form that needs to be.

944
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,980
Speaker 1: It's a lot of bureaucracy.

945
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,940
Speaker 0: Bureaucracy is always well documented the way tech people do that.

946
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,520
Speaker 0: Imagine if you used a ticketing system that had pre-created ticket types.

947
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,379
Speaker 0: So the HR person says, you know, or someone in the company makes a ticket saying, yeah, we hired this person.

948
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:12,752
Speaker 0: And that automatically creates these work orders to all the HR people to do, you know, work order to do all the business processes.

949
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:14,140
Speaker 1: and that's ticket system.

950
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,839
Speaker 1: But yeah, yes.

951
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,720
Speaker 0: But the ticket system in sets up the workflow.

952
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:28,120
Speaker 0: And then there is documentation that was that is managed in an intelligent wiki style way version with like certified versions, like people collaborate.

953
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,260
Speaker 0: And then this is the current official version of the process for onboarding.

954
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,720
Speaker 1: That's the kind of feature that not a lot of the documentation that, you know, even if setting up a wiki is a great start.

955
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,280
Speaker 0: Well, the reason I say the two, the real problem is that there are solutions to all of these tiny problems, but none of the solutions integrate with each other.

956
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:57,580
Speaker 0: If the ticketing system made the work order to the HR person and linked to the most recent certified version of the procedure, you know, and when they finished it, it closed it out.

957
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:09,000
Speaker 0: And then at the same time, like that, the process that you followed created all the secret documents about that person, like it updated the database of all the HR, like all the HR stuff.

958
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,680
Speaker 1: Well, you're going even beyond just the integration of the systems.

959
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:18,590
Speaker 1: You're actually going to the to the point where, you know, the systems enact some of the the documented procedures.

960
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:20,440
Speaker 0: because no one is me.

961
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,327
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the pie in the sky.

962
00:49:22,388 --> 00:49:37,320
Speaker 0: dream of information management, as it should be, that you have technology that manages all of your information between all of your sources intelligently, regardless of the technical skills of the people involved, purely based on their knowledge skills in their relevant fields of expertise.

963
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:39,556
Speaker 0: We are currently nowhere near that now.

964
00:49:40,341 --> 00:49:43,900
Speaker 0: Instead, we have problems like, all right, get the HR people to use Twiggy.

965
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:45,238
Speaker 0: They know how to use word.

966
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:54,720
Speaker 0: They can't use an HTML WYSIWYG editor because HTML WYSIWYG editors, as everyone technological knows, require a lot of fiddling with the stupid HTML.

967
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,840
Speaker 1: I think that is a major hurdle to wiki usage is that no one can do any of the wiki languages or the WYSIWYG editors.

968
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,940
Speaker 0: Don't try to teach them.

969
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:02,560
Speaker 0: I have tried.

970
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,259
Speaker 0: I've given class.

971
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,739
Speaker 1: I mean, you can maybe try to use like one of the Markdown languages, you know, one of the ones is simpler syntax.

972
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:09,639
Speaker 0: No, that doesn't work.

973
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,219
Speaker 1: Doesn't work.

974
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:10,920
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

975
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,520
Speaker 0: I tried to teach people TML, which is simple as shit.

976
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:16,820
Speaker 1: It's just like use a bunch of equals is under the header, you know?

977
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,858
Speaker 0: Can't even do that.

978
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,717
Speaker 1: Can't even do that.

979
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:19,920
Speaker 0: So WYSIWYG.

980
00:50:20,221 --> 00:50:22,000
Speaker 0: But you all know you're all tech people.

981
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,160
Speaker 0: You're listening to Geek Next Mondays.

982
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:26,940
Speaker 0: Half the time you use WYSIWYG, but there's always like that extra bullet point.

983
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:30,460
Speaker 0: And then you hit the HTML button and you get rid of the extra bullet point.

984
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:33,360
Speaker 0: That is already beyond 99 percent of people.

985
00:50:33,982 --> 00:50:34,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't.

986
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,519
Speaker 0: WYSIWYG is not a solution because it does not work.

987
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,400
Speaker 1: If you had one that worked, we could talk.

988
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,777
Speaker 0: But there are ones that work.

989
00:50:41,801 --> 00:50:46,859
Speaker 0: They're all for proprietary crappy wikis or they're for things that aren't wikis.

990
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,220
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

991
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:49,000
Speaker 1: That is.

992
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:56,600
Speaker 1: And the other thing, right, is that, you know, a wiki is good, but sometimes the documentation you don't want a wiki necessarily.

993
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:56,960
Speaker 0: Yes.

994
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,260
Speaker 0: Well, look, wiki is the problem with wiki, especially Twiki.

995
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:00,979
Speaker 0: The philosophy is it's open.

996
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:03,160
Speaker 0: It is hard to lock stuff down.

997
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's meant to be like Wikipedia.

998
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,300
Speaker 1: Like, oh, we assume that every user is going to be able to edit anything.

999
00:51:08,782 --> 00:51:09,063
Speaker 0: Say for

1000
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:09,565
Speaker 0: H.R.,

1001
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:18,660
Speaker 0: you know, you have people collaborating in the wiki on, say, you know, this is the procedure for setting up the health care and you keep changing it like the H.R people will rewrite it and things change.

1002
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:23,597
Speaker 0: But you need an official certified version that someone signed off on and a way to verify that.

1003
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:24,018
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1004
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:27,220
Speaker 0: And then you have like the development version, not edited in a business.

1005
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:27,800
Speaker 1: Right.

1006
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,720
Speaker 1: Even with a wiki, with collaboration and nice things like that, not all users are created equal.

1007
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:39,240
Speaker 1: You don't want, you know, the normal employees to be able to see the employee handbook that's still being worked on.

1008
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,620
Speaker 1: You want them to only be able to see the newest version and that's it.

1009
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,180
Speaker 1: You don't want them to be able to see old versions.

1010
00:51:44,462 --> 00:51:46,060
Speaker 1: You don't have to be able to see working versions.

1011
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:57,116
Speaker 1: You only want certain people to be able to look at the working version and then even fewer people to actually be able to edit the working version and only maybe one or two people to certify and make it the new version and get rid of the old one.

1012
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,020
Speaker 1: And wikis just don't have the features for that kind of stuff.

1013
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,719
Speaker 0: You can do that with Twiki like I'd set up.

1014
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,759
Speaker 1: You also like don't want like, you know, you want everyone in the business to have the access they need to the same one system.

1015
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:18,079
Speaker 1: But you don't want the secretary to see the tech documentation and like the IP addresses of all the network machines and shit.

1016
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:22,240
Speaker 1: They can't be knowing that, you know, and that no wiki takes care of that.

1017
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:23,377
Speaker 1: That that that I've heard of.

1018
00:52:23,842 --> 00:52:26,980
Speaker 0: Well, you can do it with a lot of wikis if you know about technology.

1019
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,300
Speaker 0: I mean, I made a secure Twiki.

1020
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:34,939
Speaker 0: It's people cannot read certain parts of the Twiki unless they have root access on the server with Apache, which is me.

1021
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:36,399
Speaker 0: So that's not a concern.

1022
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,620
Speaker 0: Or they're evil geniuses and they find some crazy cross-eyed scripting attack, which will be hard to do because it's behind a VPN anyway.

1023
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,217
Speaker 1: That's good.

1024
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,140
Speaker 0: And like I made secret webs and I made certifications where you can certify a document.

1025
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,293
Speaker 0: You can make all these workflows into a key to all.

1026
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:54,680
Speaker 1: you did plugins for all this stuff.

1027
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:54,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1028
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,980
Speaker 0: The thing is, they're all not robust, not intuitive.

1029
00:52:58,381 --> 00:53:02,737
Speaker 0: And good God, if I ever am going to teach a non-technical person to use any of this shit.

1030
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:03,275
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1031
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:03,808
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1032
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:06,250
Speaker 1: So, I mean, you know, you could you could.

1033
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:12,415
Speaker 1: the setup doesn't necessarily need to be so easy for a normal person, but using has to be easy for a normal person.

1034
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:22,938
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you know, if you can't get every person in the company to use it, you're not, you know, it doesn't matter even if it's perfect by what we say, if not, everyone's using it.

1035
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:23,959
Speaker 1: It's it's not working.

1036
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:25,317
Speaker 0: So what do we do?

1037
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:26,977
Speaker 0: How do we document stuff?

1038
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:29,920
Speaker 0: There's the problem.

1039
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,880
Speaker 0: There is no answer.

1040
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:44,505
Speaker 1: We ask the question, even if everyone in the company is well-meaning and wants to document and knows it's for the best and agrees on an awesome wiki solution that's perfect and has all these features and, you know, you got to do it too.

1041
00:53:44,800 --> 00:54:00,120
Speaker 1: It's it's like there's so many barriers to making it happen and all of those things sort of while they're good in the long run for awesomeness and having, you know, such any business people always see you doing this and like, that's working.

1042
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:02,640
Speaker 1: You're not making me money right now.

1043
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,160
Speaker 0: I think what we need to outline is for documentation alone.

1044
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,278
Speaker 0: Forget my pie in the sky.

1045
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,400
Speaker 0: A documentation system that I would say solves this problem.

1046
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:18,639
Speaker 0: One needs to involve for the average for the majority of users, no code or markup of any kind.

1047
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,820
Speaker 1: It has to be Microsoft Word at or or just notepad.

1048
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,840
Speaker 0: It has to be Microsoft Word because people need to be able to format.

1049
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,839
Speaker 1: It could be word pad.

1050
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:28,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, that level.

1051
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,819
Speaker 0: It has to be that level, but it has to be that level that works perfectly.

1052
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,500
Speaker 1: You could use RTF maybe.

1053
00:54:34,061 --> 00:54:36,100
Speaker 0: You know how shitty RTF is under the covers?

1054
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, if people are just uploading and editing, you know, RTFs like RTFs in the background, people are editing.

1055
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,584
Speaker 1: So what's this?

1056
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:44,540
Speaker 0: I use to share these collaboratively?

1057
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,800
Speaker 1: Well, you'll have a JavaScript RTF editor right in the browser.

1058
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:48,620
Speaker 0: All right.

1059
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,820
Speaker 1: So I'm just shooting the shit.

1060
00:54:49,963 --> 00:54:50,718
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

1061
00:54:50,940 --> 00:55:01,400
Speaker 0: So I think one way around this, if someone could come up with a sort of simple subset of HTML and make a WYSIWYG editor that only does that subset, that is actually perfect.

1062
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,577
Speaker 0: There aren't any.

1063
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:06,220
Speaker 1: Well, you just have bold, italic, underlined, big font, small font.

1064
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,420
Speaker 0: You need six heading levels.

1065
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,320
Speaker 1: Do you really need six heading levels?

1066
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:10,139
Speaker 0: Good God.

1067
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,380
Speaker 0: Looking at you at least five.

1068
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:12,940
Speaker 1: All right.

1069
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,199
Speaker 1: So you have all the heading levels and then links.

1070
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,179
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

1071
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:18,220
Speaker 0: You need to be able to make colors.

1072
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,099
Speaker 0: You need to be able to quote boxes.

1073
00:55:21,282 --> 00:55:28,480
Speaker 0: You need to be able to indent without bullet points, which nothing freaking does, because there is no good way to do that in HTML for good reason.

1074
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1075
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,439
Speaker 0: But you need it for a document management system.

1076
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:33,820
Speaker 0: You need it for documentation.

1077
00:55:34,144 --> 00:55:34,479
Speaker 0: If you can.

1078
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:42,560
Speaker 1: Well, what you could do is you could just have the CSS automatically set up such that, you know, you have an H, a header, and then it'll indent.

1079
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:43,040
Speaker 1: Right.

1080
00:55:43,362 --> 00:55:44,340
Speaker 0: And then you could do that.

1081
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,100
Speaker 1: So the headers will automatically indent based on the header level.

1082
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,819
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

1083
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:50,400
Speaker 0: That implementation, we need something that does that.

1084
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,002
Speaker 0: We don't need.

1085
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:55,820
Speaker 0: I mean, I could make a system that does that for my company, that serves all my purposes, but it won't get out there anywhere.

1086
00:55:57,081 --> 00:55:59,820
Speaker 0: We we need someone to make something that just does.

1087
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,900
Speaker 1: There are HTML WYSIWYG editors, but they're, you know, that have that limited subset.

1088
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:05,580
Speaker 1: And, you know, they're used in forums and such.

1089
00:56:06,101 --> 00:56:08,017
Speaker 1: But, you know, they don't they don't work.

1090
00:56:08,801 --> 00:56:12,460
Speaker 0: Like they the thing that works the least are bullet points.

1091
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,739
Speaker 0: The thing that people need the most works the least.

1092
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:15,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1093
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:16,647
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

1094
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:17,334
Speaker 0: Yep.

1095
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:23,080
Speaker 0: And linking documents to other documents or categorizing documents needs to be intuitive.

1096
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:29,740
Speaker 1: That's the thing is that even the simplest methods of linking like camel case linking, people can't even write the thing in camel case.

1097
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:29,987
Speaker 0: No.

1098
00:56:30,782 --> 00:56:32,179
Speaker 1: So I don't know how to make it easier.

1099
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:33,097
Speaker 1: I give up.

1100
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,776
Speaker 0: Maybe just highlight it, click link, and then it gives you a gooey of find the document you want to link to.

1101
00:56:40,386 --> 00:56:40,817
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1102
00:56:41,302 --> 00:56:41,840
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1103
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:43,540
Speaker 1: I just.

1104
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:50,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've gone lately with the root of creating like basically I will get people who are non-technical who I want to document stuff.

1105
00:56:50,840 --> 00:57:01,419
Speaker 0: I will make all the framework and all the links and I'll just make all the empty documents with sections that say write a section on this here, write a section on this here, and then they fill it in.

1106
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,339
Speaker 0: And that works really well.

1107
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:08,358
Speaker 0: The other solution I have is that one department is getting an intern and they gave the interns do it.

1108
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,120
Speaker 0: They gave me the intern and they said, make this intern right.

1109
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,139
Speaker 0: Documentation for every business process my department has.

1110
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:16,440
Speaker 0: He knows HTML.

1111
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:17,418
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

1112
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,279
Speaker 0: That kid is a good idea is going to have a miserable summer.

1113
00:57:21,964 --> 00:57:22,819
Speaker 1: He's going to get some monies.

1114
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:24,859
Speaker 0: He's going to get some money and he's going to learn some stuff.

1115
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,780
Speaker 1: He's got some resumes.

1116
00:57:26,224 --> 00:57:27,119
Speaker 0: He's not going to have fun.

1117
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,775
Speaker 1: No, he's not.

1118
00:57:28,784 --> 00:57:29,438
Speaker 1: It's all right.

1119
00:57:29,922 --> 00:57:30,318
Speaker 1: He'll be in.

1120
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:36,527
Speaker 1: Maybe he'll become an HTML documentation Wiki master and then he'll get a job making a better one.

1121
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:37,459
Speaker 1: just that we want.

1122
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:38,518
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1123
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,579
Speaker 0: But listeners, what do you think?

1124
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:39,832
Speaker 0: Why?

1125
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,220
Speaker 0: How do you document stuff?

1126
00:57:41,301 --> 00:57:42,400
Speaker 0: I know the answer is unknown.

1127
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:48,740
Speaker 1: I know that most of the people out there don't really care about all this business process shit, but we're giving you like three or four shows on it.

1128
00:57:48,981 --> 00:57:49,538
Speaker 1: So shove it.

1129
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,119
Speaker 0: All right.

1130
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,339
Speaker 0: I think we're done partly because I really want some pizza.

1131
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:54,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's get some pizza.

1132
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:54,960
Speaker 0: All right.
