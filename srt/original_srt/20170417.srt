1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,333
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 17th 2017.

2
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:13,795
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:16,283
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:18,510
Speaker 1: We're talking about PC cooling.

5
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:29,763
Speaker 0: Let's do this Alright, so remember when I was like man.

6
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,330
Speaker 0: my computer keeps having these blue screens.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,475
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play I can't?

8
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,202
Speaker 0: I gotta find a replacement motherboard.

9
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:35,929
Speaker 0: I remember remember that.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,467
Speaker 0: So I replaced that motherboard and it totally worked Until until stop working.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,752
Speaker 0: No, it didn't stop working.

12
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:44,756
Speaker 0: It's just like the computer.

13
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:45,760
Speaker 0: still it's like it's weird.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,255
Speaker 0: The computer works perfectly and just blue screens randomly and it's not it.

15
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:54,094
Speaker 0: the blue screen message Every time is a different.

16
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:54,860
Speaker 0: one is different.

17
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,120
Speaker 0: So it's like you google all these different ones and you keep getting answers.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:09,167
Speaker 0: It's like none of these are what I have and you google and it's like I keep getting a bunch of different blue screen messages and that doesn't help you either right, I'd still guess either motherboard or Probably mother.

19
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,740
Speaker 0: is it the second motherboard?

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,845
Speaker 1: Well, you gotta use motherboard.

21
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:17,600
Speaker 1: the blue screen and motherboard itself might have a congenital defect the effect of the womb.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,210
Speaker 0: So the blue screening waxes and wanes, right?

23
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,840
Speaker 1: Well based on what I don't know, huh?

24
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,126
Speaker 0: It just waxes and wanes.

25
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,895
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I don't know what you're from.

26
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:26,820
Speaker 1: I don't have these problems.

27
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:28,774
Speaker 0: I just read that's a hardware problem.

28
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:29,016
Speaker 0: It's not.

29
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,527
Speaker 0: I'm saying I Did.

30
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,080
Speaker 1: I have not had problems like this?

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,076
Speaker 1: There must be something wrong with something you did and wrong with some hardware.

32
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:35,338
Speaker 0: Nothing.

33
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:35,639
Speaker 0: I did.

34
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:38,113
Speaker 0: Hardware problem happens to anybody.

35
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:45,700
Speaker 0: so Yeah, cuz the things that I complain about other people doing is like they fuck up their own shit like oh you installed that malware.

36
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,367
Speaker 0: Oh you installed that shitty program.

37
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:48,852
Speaker 0: Oh you you you're complaining.

38
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,720
Speaker 0: your phone is broken, but you jail broke it.

39
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,764
Speaker 0: Why are you complaining?

40
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:54,034
Speaker 0: I don't tell people when they have a hardware problem.

41
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:57,626
Speaker 0: I don't get on the case Hardware breaks sometimes.

42
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,113
Speaker 1: maybe it's just time to buy a new computer.

43
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:00,420
Speaker 1: No, even though you wanted to wait.

44
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:01,940
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to buy a new computer.

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,840
Speaker 0: So I'm like, well, I did a RAM test again of like the tenth time and it says your RAM is a-ok.

46
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:07,504
Speaker 0: So I'm not.

47
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:11,707
Speaker 0: I didn't even try removing RAM sticks or anything Even though that seems like it's what it should be right.

48
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:20,047
Speaker 0: and I figure well if the CPUs busted I'm buying a new computer right, so so It's only that computer right?

49
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:35,560
Speaker 0: Yes, because a thing my new Htbc is so perfect and I think it is never because a thing that could crashed or failed in any way It is the most solid computer since my high energy ionizing radiation could cause single bit errors.

50
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,920
Speaker 1: That would lead to crashes that frequently anyway.

51
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:41,436
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if there was a high rate it like a high source of radiation like.

52
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,420
Speaker 1: so I thought your apartment.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,748
Speaker 0: So obviously blue screens are mostly caused by driver situations, right?

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,280
Speaker 0: So I thought maybe my Nvidia, you know card would be bad.

55
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,920
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll try to use my you know, the built-in card on the motherboard and just take the Nvidia card.

56
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,338
Speaker 1: That's actually a pretty good test.

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,676
Speaker 0: But you know, I figure I just updated the Nvidia driver and that didn't have an effect.

58
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:05,680
Speaker 0: so it's like well I don't really want to not have maybe the video card.

59
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,960
Speaker 0: I don't want to go down to one monitor and have no GPU, right?

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,999
Speaker 1: So in fact, I wouldn't be super surprised about something weird like the video card putting stress on the PSU.

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,099
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'll do that if I have to write it's not a PSU from.

62
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,604
Speaker 1: so Have you done voltage test?

63
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:24,380
Speaker 0: you sure if it was a PSU problem the computer would turn off and not blue screen.

64
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:35,820
Speaker 0: It depends anyway, so I go online, you know, I start researching some of the different blue screen messages Right, and one of them, you know, basically a lot of them were clearly not what was wrong with me?

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were like, oh your RAM is busted.

66
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,095
Speaker 0: I'm like, nope, that's not me.

67
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,120
Speaker 0: They're like, oh you got a malware.

68
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,198
Speaker 0: I'm like, nope, that's not me.

69
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:52,955
Speaker 0: but one of them was like yeah when Windows 10 was brand new there was some problem with this SATA driver and You know, it got fixed in a way in a later Windows update.

70
00:03:53,277 --> 00:04:05,051
Speaker 1: and I'm like Okay So does your motherboard like a lot of old motherboards have the regular SATA driver and then the other SATA chip to give you The newer motherboard?

71
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:10,289
Speaker 0: just is all Intel everything okay, so but anyways cuz I had that problem once with an 8-bit motherboard and it was the.

72
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,929
Speaker 1: there was the normal chipset that gave me like for my And then there was this other chipsets.

73
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:18,959
Speaker 0: obviously my windows 10 is updated so that's not the problem.

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,470
Speaker 0: The problem is not an out-of-date driver.

75
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I was like, huh?

76
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,952
Speaker 0: That's weird though that You know that could cause a blue screen even though it's like storage related.

77
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:31,620
Speaker 0: you figure when storage fails you just get failing storage.

78
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:34,005
Speaker 0: So I figured huh?

79
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,613
Speaker 0: Well about you know, there's a harmless process of elimination.

80
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,980
Speaker 0: I got that really old SSD in there.

81
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:40,734
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna unplug it.

82
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,532
Speaker 0: I'll just unplug the old SSD.

83
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:48,520
Speaker 0: You know, I only for storage I only use it for swap when I'm for scratch space in Adobe.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,036
Speaker 1: I don't use it for anything else just scratch space or also like Windows swap.

85
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,040
Speaker 0: No only scratch.

86
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,331
Speaker 0: So I don't use it for literally anything.

87
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:57,180
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I'll just unplug that and see what happens.

88
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,338
Speaker 0: There hasn't been a blue screen since I am play, huh?

89
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,289
Speaker 0: And I'm like really an SSD can cause blue screens like that and I don't know for sure because it hasn't been long enough To you know, I could you know.

90
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,780
Speaker 0: next step is removing the video card.

91
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,871
Speaker 1: That is the problem with that sort of intermittent hardware.

92
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:14,607
Speaker 1: problem is that unless you have Multiple copies of the same hardware.

93
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:17,480
Speaker 1: There's really no way to like test it to figure it out.

94
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,558
Speaker 0: So if the blue screen happens again hard drives going back in video cards coming out.

95
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:26,999
Speaker 1: But if it never happens again, you still don't know for sure if that was it.

96
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,943
Speaker 0: Oh, no, if it never happens again I'll be confident.

97
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,040
Speaker 0: was that I was that SSD and I bought in your motherboard for nothing.

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,364
Speaker 1: But eh, whatever the worst case would be if it doesn't happen for a while and then it happens once Happens like I run.

99
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,200
Speaker 0: I read I first I got tried reinstalling Windows and it didn't happen for a long.

100
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,491
Speaker 0: And then it happened and I'm like what the fuck.

101
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,480
Speaker 1: so with the computer.

102
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:57,410
Speaker 1: Two or three computers ago that I used to do use like resound and geek nights like in the old days with Gen 2 It would blue screen Occasionally and I figured out there's a bunch of different causes.

103
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:58,134
Speaker 1: that were they were all.

104
00:05:58,154 --> 00:05:59,540
Speaker 1: basically there are multiple things causing it.

105
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:07,580
Speaker 1: One of them was the USBs on the case had subtle shorts And when I unplugged them they stopped happening.

106
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:16,129
Speaker 1: but they then they started happening again less frequently with a different set of error codes and I eventually narrowed that one down to.

107
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:31,608
Speaker 1: if I ever let the computer hibernate or go to sleep Then I would have blue screens and when I disabled all that stuff and powered it down every day before I went to work and only Powered it up and when I was home never blue screened again Unless I plugged in those USBs.

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,578
Speaker 0: No, I'll probably buy a new computer and next to you.

109
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,659
Speaker 0: Yeah Like a 1180 if you can hold everyone else in the 1080s I'd be like, haha 1180 what you could do about it?

110
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,720
Speaker 1: Like if you're gonna buy a computer like we're in this great plateau time to buy one.

111
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,080
Speaker 1: But if you can hold out like another six months or a year, you're gonna get another generational.

112
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's no you know, my computer power wise just fun.

113
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:54,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine was not power wise.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,969
Speaker 1: That's why I got the new one And I so I did a test of a pipeline.

115
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,278
Speaker 1: cuz you know that old advance war show I did a few times.

116
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,062
Speaker 1: people really Liked it.

117
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,210
Speaker 1: people keep watching it.

118
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,680
Speaker 1: There's like tons of views on those old videos.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,204
Speaker 0: There's no other advances content.

120
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:12,835
Speaker 1: the my old CPU was literally not fast enough to fully run the DS emulators out there.

121
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:17,200
Speaker 1: So it would like run slow and cause problems.

122
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,784
Speaker 1: So I tested all that on.

123
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:26,146
Speaker 1: the new computer works like a champ and I turned on the ultra high quality sound processing Including the weird stuff 100%.

124
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,995
Speaker 1: it just maxes out one of my cores and everything's fine.

125
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,760
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna start doing the advanced war show.

126
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:37,232
Speaker 1: I think Yeah, you got any news On this Monday this tech news day.

127
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:38,237
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

128
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:43,898
Speaker 0: so You know Apple Apple made some sort of recent more announcement of.

129
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,388
Speaker 0: we're like, yeah We're actually gonna do Mac Pro.

130
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,540
Speaker 0: We know whatever right but nothing is set in stone for that, right?

131
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,879
Speaker 0: They yeah, they could come out with some more garbage or whatever.

132
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,612
Speaker 0: But basically they admitted like that the Mac the trash can Mac Pro from what?

133
00:07:56,612 --> 00:08:04,828
Speaker 0: 2012 or whatever it was sufficient, you know, they basically designed themselves into a hole where they couldn't like.

134
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:09,623
Speaker 0: upgrade when you know to newer stuff and it's like Dumb asses.

135
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:19,820
Speaker 0: just get the best possible hardware the same computer that I would buy today install OS X on it overpriced it by Thousand to two thousand dollars and sell it.

136
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,520
Speaker 0: Everyone will buy it.

137
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,679
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of nuance to that like the big complaints about the newer.

138
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:27,200
Speaker 1: You can ask book pros not being powerful enough.

139
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,063
Speaker 1: We're a little bit complicated because some aspects of them were criminally underpowered but other aspects of them We're not talking about.

140
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,618
Speaker 0: we're talking about Mac Pro the desktop thing the MacBook Pro, whatever.

141
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:48,020
Speaker 1: Yeah But the people who complained about his performance didn't seem to realize that the storage was all PCIe Which is actually like out of the realm of most computer users experience.

142
00:08:48,321 --> 00:09:00,180
Speaker 0: Whatever the point is, you know, the CPUs the GPUs most of all have always been underpowered and max Yeah, but anyway, you know still eat today and whenever Apple even updates it or price still be overpriced garbage, right?

143
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,140
Speaker 0: They don't know how to make a powerful desktop, right?

144
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:12,207
Speaker 0: I'd be very surprised if they succeeded at this even though if they just put me in charge of it Windows would just die on the desktop Because I would just be like, oh here's a $2,000 computer.

145
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:13,690
Speaker 0: it runs OS X and it's godlike.

146
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,964
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

147
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:16,313
Speaker 0: We now have 100% market share.

148
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:26,757
Speaker 0: That was easy anyway But yeah, so they're gonna fail and people, you know who must keep OS X for whatever reason they just can't Windows They can't bring themselves to Windows and obviously you can't Linux.

149
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:36,549
Speaker 0: It's true they've been doing hackintoshes more and more and hackintoshing has become more and more like Successful like it works better than it used to.

150
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,316
Speaker 1: I mean if you're not still it's still.

151
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,305
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's smooth It's still hacky.

152
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,450
Speaker 0: It's hackintosh, right?

153
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,113
Speaker 0: It's not.

154
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:45,280
Speaker 0: Oh perfectly good Macintosh, right It's hackintosh.

155
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:55,112
Speaker 0: But if you want to do it you can do it like if you don't need to play games and you want a powerful computer and you want to run OS X and You don't want to pay a whole bunch for a shitty computer from Apple.

156
00:09:55,674 --> 00:10:03,975
Speaker 0: You can buy regular parts Just figure out which the right parts beforehand and install OS X on a normal desktop computer With an Intel i7 and a 1080 and whatever.

157
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:17,192
Speaker 0: so What the big news is is that Nvidia put out some new drivers for their new crazy Titan ridiculous video card But also for pretty much all Pascal video cards, which are

158
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,456
Speaker 1: all so the 1050 the 10 series

159
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:25,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, the 10 series and up right all the new ones the ones that you would buy today Not the old ones that you know There's no reason to buy.

160
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:35,037
Speaker 1: it also supports all the older geforce and quadra going all the way back to the 8000 series Sure, but anyway, the point is they released Mac drivers for these things.

161
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:50,843
Speaker 0: It's like wait a minute Wait, you released Mac drivers OS X drivers for a video card that the only way anyone could possibly put one of these video cards into a Mac is either a You've got the old trash can Mac Pro and you find a way to make it fit in there Which

162
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:51,612
Speaker 1: I'm dubious.

163
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,498
Speaker 0: if that's possible I don't think you can do that too.

164
00:10:54,186 --> 00:11:04,868
Speaker 0: You can get one of these like External things were like you take a video card and you plug it into your macbook pro with like a you know Thunderbolt cable kind of deal or USB C cable.

165
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,974
Speaker 1: Why is that a thing?

166
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:08,257
Speaker 0: I think it's possible.

167
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,183
Speaker 0: But yeah, whatever Yeah possible.

168
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,191
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of things are possible with computing.

169
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:14,480
Speaker 1: run J2 the world is possible.

170
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,860
Speaker 0: See you make yourself a hackintosh.

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,900
Speaker 0: So now there's an the one part of hackintoshing that was before You know or one of the parts that was slightly hacky is now significantly less hack.

172
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,456
Speaker 0: You have an official legit Nvidia driver that we presume and video is testing on hackintoshes.

173
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:30,640
Speaker 0: cuz what else the hell could they test?

174
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:31,765
Speaker 1: So that's it.

175
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,273
Speaker 1: The real story here.

176
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:34,460
Speaker 1: Isn't that it happened?

177
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,050
Speaker 1: It's why did Nvidia do it?

178
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,793
Speaker 1: for the fuck of it?

179
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:39,340
Speaker 1: did Nvidia do it because of some agreement?

180
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:49,805
Speaker 0: Oh because they're gonna make some Monet because there's people who are Mac people who are insisting on being Mac people are not buying Nvidia cards and now it's like hey all you people who insist on Not windowsing.

181
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:52,079
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll sell some Nvidia cards to you.

182
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,980
Speaker 0: It was worth it for us to make this driver to get those extra sales.

183
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:04,720
Speaker 1: I don't know if that alone is enough business driver because I've seen Companies leave way more money on the table because it's not worth the effort.

184
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,105
Speaker 0: well, also, I'm pretty sure the Apple computers like have ATI cards in them, right I Don't even know anymore.

185
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:20,379
Speaker 0: I think I don't think this Nvidia's in the max right now From what I've definitely been in there in the past, but I don't think they are now.

186
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:23,467
Speaker 1: Everything is talking about hackintoshes.

187
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:26,720
Speaker 0: when I google for that obviously right just go to app.

188
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh that I think has and I think that is Nvidia.

189
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,311
Speaker 1: That's from 2012.

190
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:30,552
Speaker 0: Yeah.

191
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:34,165
Speaker 1: Oh My god this website.

192
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,010
Speaker 1: I don't even care anymore.

193
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:45,900
Speaker 1: I've already given up but I Wonder if this is part of a longer-term thing where the next max are just going to have modern video cards.

194
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,901
Speaker 1: Or maybe actually if Apple were smart and they didn't want to go your route of put you in charge of everything the smart Route.

195
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:57,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's that there's a middle path where you make them at the new whatever the new Mac.

196
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, no Completely still like trash can.

197
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:13,603
Speaker 1: Mac Pro has AMD cards in it But you make it still the like closed black box except you have a slot where you can put in a commodity video card The.

198
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:19,520
Speaker 1: so someone who buys the new Mac could keep replacing the video card and upgrading it.

199
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:29,473
Speaker 1: but they can't replace anything else without going through the Apple process and that would require probably a Relatively simple deal between Nvidia and Apple.

200
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:30,939
Speaker 1: I could see that happening though.

201
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:35,492
Speaker 1: Imagine the new trash can that has a video card slot you slot the video card.

202
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:41,063
Speaker 0: the MacBook Pros have Intel iris graphics 450.

203
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:49,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably if you want a powerful laptop at this point you just get a surface book Pro with the performance base for service book, whatever.

204
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:50,851
Speaker 1: There's the surface and the surface book.

205
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,260
Speaker 1: get the one that has the performance base.

206
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,518
Speaker 0: No, if you want a powerful laptop you get the gaming one.

207
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,566
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You think it actually has a real GP.

208
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,770
Speaker 0: got ones with 1080s in them.

209
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,838
Speaker 1: that weighs almost as much as my desktop.

210
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:01,360
Speaker 0: It runs.

211
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,922
Speaker 0: It runs.

212
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,914
Speaker 1: not really a laptop so much as a portable computer that has a screen.

213
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:11,767
Speaker 0: It's still smaller than Like a mini ITX desktop.

214
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:12,670
Speaker 1: That is true.

215
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,620
Speaker 0: That is in fact true and doesn't require carrying a monitor.

216
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:25,920
Speaker 1: So in other news, this is this is a good use of technology and I'm really surprised This wasn't more widely deployed sooner and it may have been but I never really noticed it.

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:36,140
Speaker 1: But so cops in Colorado are trying out this technology where the front of the cop car Can shoot a big old dart covered in glue like James Bond.

218
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:41,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sticks to the car in front of them and it's just a GPS beacon.

219
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:47,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean if you're sitting in your car and you're driving and you're trying to get away from the cops and you hear Thunk, you know, you'll be like, huh?

220
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,179
Speaker 0: So then the cops stop following you and you go, huh and you get out of your car.

221
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:53,940
Speaker 1: You've got to stop to get out.

222
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:57,994
Speaker 1: They don't necessarily have to stop following you but it's not a high-speed pursuit.

223
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:04,940
Speaker 1: The only way to deal with this thing Pretty quickly, especially if the cops are chasing you your buddy, you know does a little action scene, right?

224
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,046
Speaker 0: He's hanging out the window.

225
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:07,695
Speaker 1: Well, it's on the back of the car.

226
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:08,600
Speaker 1: I don't think that's gonna happen.

227
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:14,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get on the trunk, you know crowbar I feel like your best option is to because remember that you got to abandon the car.

228
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:18,580
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's just gonna force you to abandon it sooner and turn it into a foot chase.

229
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:26,439
Speaker 1: but cops are actually using this stuff now and technology's actually made it pretty sweet and pretty safe and pretty affordable.

230
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:33,549
Speaker 1: and supposedly they've been using these things for nine months now and They've had 85% success rate.

231
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,174
Speaker 0: success rate is measured.

232
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,000
Speaker 0: how when when do they use them?

233
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,983
Speaker 0: When do they not use them?

234
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:43,100
Speaker 1: in situations where they would have had a high-speed pursuit because the suspect attempted to escape?

235
00:15:44,142 --> 00:16:03,060
Speaker 1: so instead they just shoot the dart and then Helicopters and other cops can just sort of corral them or figure out where they dump the car and then as the foot chase Makes it a lot harder to get away because the whole goal of a high-speed pursuit is To still have the car and be out of line of sight of the cops long enough to get away.

236
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:15,559
Speaker 1: This makes that real hard to do because you can't even if you stop to try to take the thing off the car Like the cops know literally exactly where you are and that you've stopped gonna put an EMP in your car.

237
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,810
Speaker 1: The EMP would also take out the car.

238
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:20,054
Speaker 0: get old car.

239
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:21,560
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you know car.

240
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:26,736
Speaker 1: I feel like the James Bond already have has ways to deal with this.

241
00:16:27,057 --> 00:16:29,859
Speaker 1: This is more for James meth addict.

242
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,684
Speaker 1: I Couldn't come up with another name.

243
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,535
Speaker 0: So just yeah, that's pretty much 90% of the time who's running.

244
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,760
Speaker 1: but this is in my idea.

245
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,496
Speaker 1: this is a good and interesting use of technology because there's a problem.

246
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:45,268
Speaker 1: the problem is Someone doesn't want to get arrested.

247
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:52,591
Speaker 1: when the police decide they're going to arrest them and there's and the cops have a choice Let the criminal go or chase them with their car.

248
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,139
Speaker 1: And as we know when you have cars chasing each other.

249
00:16:55,942 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 1: Blues Brothers is gonna happen at some point and actually a lot of people get killed in high-speed pursuits Usually people unrelated to the high-speed pursuit.

250
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:09,036
Speaker 1: So even the ACLU weighed in saying that as long as they use them as they're intended.

251
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,160
Speaker 1: This is great.

252
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,061
Speaker 1: It's not illegal.

253
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:16,228
Speaker 1: They're pretty much fine with it because this is only used when someone is.

254
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:23,640
Speaker 0: this isn't the kind I mean, you know Long law enforcement in general has misused GPS like they sneak up to your car at night and stick it inside.

255
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,640
Speaker 0: This is a thing that's like funk.

256
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,340
Speaker 0: It's on the back of your car and they're only using it when the cop is behind you and chasing you.

257
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like, you know, there this is.

258
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,255
Speaker 1: You can hide it in your car at night to see what you're doing all they do, but this isn't that.

259
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,907
Speaker 1: yeah This uses.

260
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:41,934
Speaker 0: this is an okay use.

261
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:49,159
Speaker 0: It's also very obvious like, you know, like even if you're even if you're just speeding and they you know They drive behind you and use it.

262
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:54,755
Speaker 1: I love the idea of you know, if we're gonna have cars that humans still drive.

263
00:17:54,775 --> 00:18:04,960
Speaker 1: I am really okay with 100% enforcement of reasonable traffic laws like everyone who ever runs a stop sign immediate ticket immediate never drive again ever.

264
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:06,867
Speaker 0: I think any driving.

265
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:12,610
Speaker 0: if we have cars that are have computers driving them Right and they drive effectively perfectly.

266
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:17,612
Speaker 0: if you don't drive as perfectly as they do You shouldn't be allowed to drive because you're effectively murdering.

267
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:25,700
Speaker 1: the practical reality of shitty Is that you need a car to live unless you live in like one of four places in the entire country, right?

268
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,072
Speaker 0: So we'll give you a self-driving car.

269
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:27,838
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

270
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:34,782
Speaker 0: Okay The problem you don't even have to give you one self-driving cars just driving around everywhere on their own and you just have one get in.

271
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:45,720
Speaker 1: but the leap the leap of society between we have the technology and We give that technology to all Americans to make society better.

272
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,660
Speaker 1: I feel like the Gulf between those two is politically insurmountable.

273
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:50,906
Speaker 0: I'm also okay with the all.

274
00:18:50,926 --> 00:19:05,738
Speaker 0: there's another with another plan right the same opposite plan Which is in places where people have used sidewalks we ban all cars No, and in places where people don't use sidewalks, you know, like the rest of the country We don't have any traffic rules.

275
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:12,196
Speaker 0: Everyone who drives X everyone who drives will just eventually die and will buy buy natural selection will get rid.

276
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,987
Speaker 0: of all people who want to drive Everything will be great.

277
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:25,233
Speaker 1: So I have driven cars in and around Istanbul and I've also ridden on motorbikes in Hyderabad in Mumbai.

278
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,620
Speaker 0: That's like almost the worst in the world.

279
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:30,024
Speaker 1: Also Sao Paulo.

280
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,451
Speaker 0: I've heard a Kyra heard Cairo is possibly the worst.

281
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,440
Speaker 1: Sao Paulo and Brazil like in the downtown.

282
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,149
Speaker 1: It's like New York in the freeways outside of New York.

283
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,352
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

284
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,620
Speaker 1: Four lanes is actually twelve lanes.

285
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:53,129
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

286
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:58,429
Speaker 1: Emily and I the other night stumbled upon this literally just randomly looking at YouTube shit.

287
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,884
Speaker 1: There is a movie slash documentary from 1988 called computer dreams.

288
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:16,218
Speaker 1: Okay, what it is is a showcase of the heights of computer animation in 1988.

289
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:20,534
Speaker 0: so slightly better than Tron, uh Not really.

290
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:20,594
Speaker 0: no.

291
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:26,409
Speaker 1: so a lot of the things that we think of as computer animation were mostly practical effects back then.

292
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:38,270
Speaker 1: This looks like like the the best things in this documentary Look worse than the worst student project you have ever seen in your life from any year since.

293
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,178
Speaker 0: But you said it was 1988 though, right?

294
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, but what year did Tron come out?

295
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:46,438
Speaker 0: 1983 two three something like that.

296
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,986
Speaker 0: I think Tron is definitely before 1982, right?

297
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:49,266
Speaker 1: I was right.

298
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:53,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is six years after Tron.

299
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:55,290
Speaker 0: shouldn't everything look at least as good as Tron?

300
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,762
Speaker 0: So how good should look should look six years better than on.

301
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,307
Speaker 1: how good to try to actually look into.

302
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:04,329
Speaker 1: which parts of Toronto Are you thinking about that are actually computer generated fully?

303
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,499
Speaker 1: Versus which ones actually use a lot of the light cycles.

304
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,306
Speaker 0: The light cycles are computer generated.

305
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:10,470
Speaker 1: They don't look that good.

306
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:11,878
Speaker 0: Tron looks good.

307
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're looking at GL Tron there.

308
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:16,648
Speaker 1: That's the photo on IMDb.

309
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,140
Speaker 0: That might be GL Tron and not actual Tron.

310
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,390
Speaker 1: the point is the best part about the documentary.

311
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,473
Speaker 0: There's this documentary.

312
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:23,516
Speaker 0: that is your thing of the day.

313
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,922
Speaker 0: look better than those screenshots of Tron.

314
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:27,787
Speaker 0: So it's six years better.

315
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:33,230
Speaker 1: Uh So it's kind of all over the place because it's a highlight from a lot of different studios.

316
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,531
Speaker 0: I think it's not the height of 88.

317
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:38,522
Speaker 0: So there's probably some demo scene stuff from 88 that looks better.

318
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,650
Speaker 1: Well demo scene is very different from this stuff.

319
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,890
Speaker 0: Well, you said the height demo scene is the height.

320
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,127
Speaker 1: well so demo scene is a little bit different because that is not so much.

321
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:50,930
Speaker 1: that is computer graphics as opposed to like models and computer like rendering.

322
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:52,818
Speaker 0: It's one of those.

323
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,330
Speaker 0: or what it looks like isn't great.

324
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:59,870
Speaker 1: A lot of demo scene stuff is raster graphics or very specialized draw the pixels.

325
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,572
Speaker 1: I'm just saying as opposed to here is a model of a thing You're not.

326
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,219
Speaker 0: you're not talking about how like how good it looks.

327
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:11,750
Speaker 0: you think about like the the height is in terms of like the Functionality behind it like whoa, this looks like crap, but it's actually a physics engine from 1988.

328
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,658
Speaker 1: So the technology the output the uses of it.

329
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:19,110
Speaker 1: the craziest part is this one bit showed the idea of modeling.

330
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,550
Speaker 1: How do you make a computer model of a person to then like animate?

331
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:39,723
Speaker 1: So they literally sculpted a person and then drew on that physical model basically a mesh of polygons and then used a light pen to trace over the Physical model to input the data into the computer to make the model.

332
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:40,105
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

333
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:41,690
Speaker 0: I remember when they did that.

334
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:42,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, you remember that.

335
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:44,785
Speaker 1: you remember it to them doing that in 1989.

336
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:48,950
Speaker 0: I remember those days I've seen that I've seen I've seen that technology in use before.

337
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:55,714
Speaker 1: This video also gives some pretty heavy vaporwave vibes if you watch it, so Good luck.

338
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:56,095
Speaker 1: Have fun.

339
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:56,456
Speaker 1: Watch it.

340
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:56,978
Speaker 1: Enjoy it.

341
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,041
Speaker 1: And it's pretty.

342
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:00,449
Speaker 1: it's pretty interesting to see this.

343
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:15,050
Speaker 0: So in more crime news, there are some people in prison I don't know what for they were at the what the hell the Ohio department Rehabilitation and Corrections Center somewhere in Ohio Marion Correctional Institution Anyway in Marion, Ohio.

344
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:20,907
Speaker 0: So they were in prison and part of their prisonness was they got computer classes in prison.

345
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:28,410
Speaker 0: and I was like when I read that I was like, hey, maybe I should like go to prison like no just like just like Rikers Island wanted me to teach people.

346
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:32,227
Speaker 0: You know, I guess they're gonna close it right but you know, I'll go teach people in prison.

347
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:32,810
Speaker 0: How do you computer?

348
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,833
Speaker 0: I'll teach him real good.

349
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:36,062
Speaker 1: I suspect they will not pay you enough money.

350
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:37,408
Speaker 0: It's a volunteer job.

351
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:37,910
Speaker 0: I assume.

352
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:51,699
Speaker 0: but anyway, all right, but they got computer classes in prison totally cool and Apparently these the the supervision at this prison was good enough to keep anyone from escaping Because I guess no one escaped as far as I could tell.

353
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:56,841
Speaker 0: but they didn't really give a shit what people did in the prison Which seems to be how prison goes.

354
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:05,870
Speaker 0: Yes, so They took these computer parts and basically took working computers back into some sort of you know place.

355
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,976
Speaker 0: So they're not supposed to have them.

356
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,329
Speaker 0: and not only did they have working computers They plugged them in to the network.

357
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:20,910
Speaker 0: They put the computers in the ceiling and connected them to the network Yep, and logged in using an employee's login when that employee was not at work.

358
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,609
Speaker 0: This wasn't just the prison network.

359
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:29,310
Speaker 0: It was like the state's computer network because it was a state prison and it's all the state places are on the same network.

360
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:34,322
Speaker 0: So I'm assuming they only found out because the state IT guys noticed.

361
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:34,904
Speaker 0: Huh?

362
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,049
Speaker 0: There's a lot of activity coming from like these two.

363
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:40,116
Speaker 0: Where the hell are these computers?

364
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:41,521
Speaker 0: Oh shit, they're in this prison.

365
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,107
Speaker 0: Who's the hell's doing it?

366
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,050
Speaker 0: Oh, it's this guy.

367
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:46,419
Speaker 0: He's doing it when he's not even on the job.

368
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:49,370
Speaker 0: When is he easy logging in on like Sunday morning to internet?

369
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:50,754
Speaker 0: What the hell right.

370
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:55,010
Speaker 0: and then they found out and it's like whoa, but if we are ever in prison obvious.

371
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:57,441
Speaker 0: So so way to go prisoners good job.

372
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,345
Speaker 0: This was on FARC.

373
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,174
Speaker 0: So I don't Prison.

374
00:25:01,194 --> 00:25:02,644
Speaker 0: bad job unless it was just drugs.

375
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:03,489
Speaker 0: in which case good job.

376
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,358
Speaker 1: So, uh, what did you read?

377
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,684
Speaker 1: what they use the computers to do?

378
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:07,568
Speaker 0: look at porn.

379
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:07,970
Speaker 0: I assume.

380
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:19,701
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You assume that to quote the Ohio Inspector General says visitors found inmate use the computer to steal the identity of another inmate Submit credit card applications on his behalf and commit tax fraud.

381
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:21,085
Speaker 0: Well, they just.

382
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:21,768
Speaker 0: you're in prison.

383
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:22,510
Speaker 0: What good is money?

384
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,536
Speaker 0: What good is a credit card?

385
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,020
Speaker 0: You're in prison.

386
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,350
Speaker 0: Amazon ain't gonna deliver shit one.

387
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:30,470
Speaker 1: I assume you're gonna get out of prison at some point at least you think you will - you pry no people on the outside.

388
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:32,790
Speaker 0: You're having your people on the outside buy good shit.

389
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,067
Speaker 0: So when you get out you be like, ah, here's all the good shit about it.

390
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,869
Speaker 1: Maybe or maybe you're sending money to people and then they're getting your.

391
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,270
Speaker 1: you know They're sneaking the contraband in because our prisons let people do whatever they want.

392
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,667
Speaker 0: I see computers in so why not right?

393
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,394
Speaker 0: Yeah That's pretty good.

394
00:25:46,454 --> 00:25:47,841
Speaker 0: I also read that.

395
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:55,610
Speaker 0: I don't know if they had a. I don't know if they had a printer But apparently they made like security passes and use that get through security checkpoints.

396
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:59,826
Speaker 1: So I've known a few people have worked at prison over the years and so have you and I did that.

397
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,838
Speaker 1: the one thing I've Learned from talking to anyone who's ever interacted with their prison system.

398
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,402
Speaker 1: Is that it's garbage.

399
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:14,570
Speaker 1: people in prison are bored and They will eventually figure out how to get around things because they're bored.

400
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,550
Speaker 0: That's right back in the day prisoners used to like, you know study in the library and pass the bar, right?

401
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:29,470
Speaker 0: I'm sure some of them still do that because they know their public defender can't help them because they got 7,000 cases So they end up doing it themselves, you know, cuz they're not guilty or whatever, right?

402
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:36,822
Speaker 0: So that you know, that's just one of the things you can do with your prison time man If I was in prison, I would you know, it was some skill.

403
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,390
Speaker 0: I would practice that I'd be become the god of something.

404
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:44,426
Speaker 0: Nope, no matter at least way and at least one thing possibly more than one thing.

405
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:45,530
Speaker 1: You're real good at shivs.

406
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:49,956
Speaker 0: Oh, man Where's that?

407
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:50,218
Speaker 1: cop?

408
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:54,116
Speaker 1: prison comics momo Shav is like ain't done yet.

409
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:54,537
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,020
Speaker 0: No, man, you go to the MoMA.

411
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,505
Speaker 0: They'd be like Scott's shivs like masterpieces.

412
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:02,661
Speaker 1: I Saw an exhibit in a museum once.

413
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:07,720
Speaker 1: that was a collection of Improvised weapons from US prison.

414
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,150
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the thing of the day a long long time ago.

415
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:12,290
Speaker 1: No when I was a kid, I saw it in a museum in Detroit.

416
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:18,494
Speaker 0: Are you sure it wasn't the thing of the day that we're from a long time ago It was it's been the thing of the day I think multiple times.

417
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:24,491
Speaker 0: that is often a thing on the internet is an extremely early thing of the day like 2005 or 6.

418
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:28,084
Speaker 1: Anyway, oh look a ton of improvised prison weapons.

419
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,414
Speaker 1: Oh Look at this gun.

420
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:31,960
Speaker 0: It's a gun.

421
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,706
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good zip gun there.

422
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:34,630
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

423
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,965
Speaker 1: That looks like a four-barreled shotgun.

424
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,650
Speaker 0: someone made Good job.

425
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:43,253
Speaker 1: Here's some pretty good shivs.

426
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:47,445
Speaker 1: Well, this guy's got like a cross guard for his fans like a dueling spoon.

427
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:47,545
Speaker 1: Yeah.

428
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:55,827
Speaker 1: Yeah In the middle of the book the book is still Frank Gerberts dune Dune a not do.

429
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:57,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll read it.

430
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:58,737
Speaker 0: It's on Carmack's doom.

431
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,261
Speaker 1: We'll read it at some point.

432
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,607
Speaker 1: It's doing some point.

433
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:07,856
Speaker 1: after I Began in I'm hanging out with the bird people now.

434
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:08,920
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna do that great be.

435
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:13,736
Speaker 1: second and I got the master sword Finally, yeah, I just I never.

436
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:19,613
Speaker 1: I only have two stamina wheels and I just went around beating shrines until I got enough heart containers I beat.

437
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,057
Speaker 0: I got I will.

438
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:25,510
Speaker 0: I've never treated with the dark guy in a clean house before I you know, whatever.

439
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:27,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've never treated with the dark God.

440
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:29,610
Speaker 0: I haven't played in a while gonna play probably me today.

441
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,949
Speaker 1: I was playing last night during that awful hockey game.

442
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,715
Speaker 0: anyway What other metamoments we got?

443
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:37,301
Speaker 1: our YouTube channels are pretty good.

444
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:37,983
Speaker 1: You should follow them.

445
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:40,230
Speaker 0: We're making more video contents lately.

446
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,052
Speaker 0: You should watch.

447
00:28:41,293 --> 00:28:42,356
Speaker 0: you follow us on.

448
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,462
Speaker 0: you know, any social media that you got?

449
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:47,010
Speaker 0: Twitter Facebook's Instagram.

450
00:28:47,312 --> 00:28:48,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have all those things.

451
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:50,990
Speaker 0: We are on all the places of the Internet.

452
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:59,128
Speaker 1: so I'm actually trying to post to Instagram more because I made an account and I never really used it and I Noticed that a ton of you are following it even though I never really post anything.

453
00:28:59,148 --> 00:28:59,550
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna start.

454
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:03,698
Speaker 0: I think I have a geek night's Instagram I made I don't know where with the.

455
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:14,429
Speaker 0: I gotta log into it again, but I met when I made it I was like, aha every time we do a thing like go to a convention or whatever I could post like a photo and then I kept meaning to do it and then not doing it.

456
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:17,848
Speaker 0: But maybe now that I've said something maybe we'll do it.

457
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,929
Speaker 0: We can post photos of geek nights things there.

458
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:28,270
Speaker 1: So, uh, otherwise, yeah, let's just get right into it with computer cooling because we've never really talked about this in depth.

459
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,590
Speaker 1: We've always talked about like the side issues around it or we talked about servers.

460
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:41,970
Speaker 0: This is one of those topics right where we feel like we did a show on it because we it comes up all the time And we talk about it all the time, but it never got its own show.

461
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:45,503
Speaker 0: We did do a show on server room cooling which has nothing to do with this.

462
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:47,311
Speaker 1: Yep, and we did that show in like 2013.

463
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:49,170
Speaker 1: I want to say it was a long time ago.

464
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,250
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna start way low cuz that's how we got to do in geek night.

465
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,110
Speaker 1: Yeah Like the old how computers work series I did back in 2006 you got yourself a computer.

466
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:58,915
Speaker 0: And how does the computer work?

467
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:03,186
Speaker 0: is basically this chip which is basically a bunch of wires really tiny.

468
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:04,610
Speaker 1: No, you're going that low.

469
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:09,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a basically a flat piece of silicon with electricity running through it like crazy.

470
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:17,878
Speaker 0: Right now if you take a wire and just put it on a double-a battery, which is not a lot of electricity That wire gets so hot it burns you.

471
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:18,861
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

472
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:21,250
Speaker 1: I mean the battery will get hotter than the wire.

473
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,743
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it gets hot.

474
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:25,110
Speaker 0: That's how electrons work, right?

475
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,034
Speaker 0: They make metal hot.

476
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,516
Speaker 0: what show?

477
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:28,124
Speaker 1: the electron turns through stuff.

478
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:29,490
Speaker 1: they get hot, right?

479
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:41,883
Speaker 0: So when you have a big old power supply on your computer and you're shoving all those watts through this basically extremely thin flat piece of silicon Semiconductor it gets crazy hot right?

480
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:43,069
Speaker 0: That's just how it does now.

481
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:47,970
Speaker 1: Why not let it get hot now in the old days with like old crappy computers?

482
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:55,690
Speaker 0: Sure, a lot of old computers would just be super hot Yeah, and it's like as long as it doesn't get so hot that it breaks.

483
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,438
Speaker 0: Why not right?

484
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,910
Speaker 0: I mean it makes your room warm.

485
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,813
Speaker 0: But it's not really an issue unless it like melts the chip and it stops working Right.

486
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:10,870
Speaker 0: as long as the computer keeps working It's fine any and computer chips can operate at pretty high temperatures actually like hot enough to burn you.

487
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,848
Speaker 0: But the computer is just fine.

488
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:24,557
Speaker 1: But in the old days like 486 like these early days of computing They're like the wires inside of all this stuff were actually pretty big and the things weren't doing that much work And they weren't using that much power.

489
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:30,080
Speaker 1: Like I don't think you realize how slow a 286 is yeah compared to modern computing.

490
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:36,097
Speaker 0: It's like my modern computer is like a thousands of Maybe even hundreds.

491
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:42,490
Speaker 0: I made tens of I don't even know how many a lot Yeah, at least thousands anyway, so in the old days you pretty much just like a computer just worked.

492
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,775
Speaker 1: You didn't really think about cooling.

493
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:48,938
Speaker 1: you definitely never had to do anything about cooling Yeah, you didn't even build your own.

494
00:31:49,058 --> 00:32:01,390
Speaker 0: often often the computer would have you know, even Things that aren't actual like full PCs But just electronics will have heat sinks for any parts that heat up right and a heat sink is a really basic device.

495
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,019
Speaker 0: It's a piece of metal shaped in an interesting way.

496
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:08,637
Speaker 0: So basically all you're trying to do with a heat sink is increased surface area.

497
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:14,469
Speaker 0: right you've got this chip that's flat and It gets hot and the heat comes out the top.

498
00:32:15,254 --> 00:32:27,204
Speaker 0: So if you put a piece of metal on top that conducts heat Right that piece of metal will heat up and then that piece of metal has wings or you know fins on it of some Kind or spikes or some something to increase the surface area.

499
00:32:27,224 --> 00:32:33,310
Speaker 0: It's all about surface area and That will just conduct the heat into the air more efficiently.

500
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,230
Speaker 0: So it cools down faster.

501
00:32:35,312 --> 00:32:43,470
Speaker 0: You know like if you take a heat sink and you just put it on like your forehead like your forehead will feel cool because The heat coming out of your head is being conducted, right?

502
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,342
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

503
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:46,886
Speaker 0: you know We make hats for people in the winter to stay warm.

504
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:51,870
Speaker 0: that insulate We can make heat sink has to cool down in the summer and I just I guess it's not stylish.

505
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,069
Speaker 0: Well, the reason would also be really heavy wearing metal on your head.

506
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:03,201
Speaker 1: The main reason you need to increase all the surface area is because it turns out if you don't know this that air like the air You breathe it's actually a really good insulator.

507
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only reason the air.

508
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:09,430
Speaker 0: That's why winter coats are warm because they're all poofy and the air is insulating.

509
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:13,530
Speaker 0: The only reason the layers keep you warm cuz every layer has area between.

510
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:18,384
Speaker 1: Without a fan like with that heat sink is because the air actually moves around.

511
00:33:18,424 --> 00:33:22,461
Speaker 1: because the convection says the air gets hot It'll start cycling around and moving out of the way.

512
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:24,490
Speaker 1: because there's a lot of reasons not getting into the physics.

513
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:34,190
Speaker 1: But because air is not a good Conductor of heat you need to have the biggest surface area possible to spread that heat out exposed to as much air as possible.

514
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:39,393
Speaker 0: So the heat sink was like the first step of cooling computers that they didn't break from all the heat They made right.

515
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:42,490
Speaker 1: and then the old days you pretty much just had a heat sink on your CPU, right?

516
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:49,330
Speaker 0: So the second step was we had to introduce fans right because the air just from convection alone wasn't moving around enough.

517
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,458
Speaker 0: now You're like, well, wait a minute.

518
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:51,870
Speaker 0: Why do I need a fan?

519
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,881
Speaker 0: Can't I just like not put my computer in a box.

520
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,010
Speaker 0: right if we didn't put our computers in boxes?

521
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:00,150
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you actually probably wouldn't need as much fans.

522
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:09,070
Speaker 0: You could just make sure that like your room has good circulation or you've got an air conditioner on or something You know, but like you would need a lot less fan if you didn't put your computer in a box.

523
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:15,135
Speaker 1: So air that's moved on its own by the heat action alone Doesn't move that much.

524
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,666
Speaker 0: No, but when you've got a lot more air in the room, right?

525
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:19,830
Speaker 0: It's not as much of a problem.

526
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:27,768
Speaker 0: However, the thing is when you put your computer in a box, you know You're trapping that hot air in there to some extent even if you got holes and stuff, right?

527
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:41,610
Speaker 0: So the reason we put the computer in a box, even though it causes a slight heat problem Is because you're gonna expose your expensive computer to someone stepping on it someone spilling something on it someone kicking it.

528
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,172
Speaker 1: So forget all those practical concerns.

529
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:44,594
Speaker 1: only two real reasons.

530
00:34:45,135 --> 00:34:46,237
Speaker 0: one boxes are cool.

531
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:48,000
Speaker 1: electronics attract us.

532
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,449
Speaker 1: So if electronics are exposed to the open air, they will be covered in dust.

533
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,550
Speaker 1: Why do you think you need to dust your TV all the time?

534
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's why even though it's bad for heat.

535
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:08,721
Speaker 1: We put the computer in a box But - if you just have all the components out in the air and you don't have some sort of active Directed movement of air over those heat sinks.

536
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:10,750
Speaker 1: You're not actually gonna get that much cool.

537
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,618
Speaker 0: It'll still be better than in the box.

538
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,170
Speaker 0: Well, it's an improvement over in the box is what I'm saying.

539
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:20,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, assuming you don't have any fans, but by putting it in the box you can direct air through.

540
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,670
Speaker 0: You can direct air through it even without the box, right?

541
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,210
Speaker 1: Yeah with unless you direct the air pretty like if you don't have channels or some way to really direct the air You're not gonna get that much better.

542
00:35:29,812 --> 00:35:42,369
Speaker 1: fans are pretty directed and the first of the big difference between old computers and new computers is that as Computers have gotten more complicated more parts of the computer generate a lot of heat that needs to be distributed.

543
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:42,851
Speaker 0: Yes That's.

544
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,870
Speaker 1: that's why motherboards today have a whole bunch of passive heat sinks and heat pipes all the fuck over them.

545
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:55,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so computers got faster and they got hotter and we figured well, we can't really make them faster without making them hotter very easily.

546
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,924
Speaker 0: Let's just make them faster and solve the heat problem separately, right?

547
00:35:58,984 --> 00:36:00,250
Speaker 0: so fans.

548
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:05,490
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of argument going on the internet like about how you should do fans, right?

549
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,057
Speaker 0: Like what kind of fans you should get?

550
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:07,700
Speaker 0: how many?

551
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,710
Speaker 0: which direction do you aim them all this stuff?

552
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,203
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna tell you what you should do.

553
00:36:11,244 --> 00:36:15,965
Speaker 0: number one You got to make the heat sure the heat sink on the CPU the hottest thing.

554
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,254
Speaker 0: as a fan on it It's gonna come with one.

555
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:21,265
Speaker 1: So right again now this really comes down to you can?

556
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:24,033
Speaker 1: there are passive heat sinks for CPUs.

557
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:32,283
Speaker 1: the drawbacks of these are one it better not be a super high-performing Chip or it's gonna slow itself down because it's gonna get too hot adding.

558
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,535
Speaker 0: having that you got the increased surface area Thanks to this awesome heat sink.

559
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:37,481
Speaker 0: If you start blowing the air onto it.

560
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:40,090
Speaker 0: That's just like whoa super cooling right there.

561
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,227
Speaker 0: It's so good, right?

562
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:54,009
Speaker 0: If you want to see this in action, look at passive heat sinks on modern computers or go Go on YouTube find videos of like CPU fans taken with like thermal like infrared camera type things and it's like Oh, I see how the fan works.

563
00:36:54,552 --> 00:37:09,470
Speaker 1: Ooh, you can also see videos of like blowing smoke into computers to see how the smoke travels through all the fans but the passive heat sinks on modern CPUs are Enormous because they have to be enormous if there's no fan in it actively moving air through it.

564
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:15,790
Speaker 1: Yep, because all the air moving through really does is expose it to more air of a lower average temperature, right?

565
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,974
Speaker 0: You know think about this right?

566
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:20,506
Speaker 0: Imagine you're in your room, right and it's summer.

567
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:21,610
Speaker 0: It's hot summer.

568
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:25,129
Speaker 0: It's so hot that I'm even sweating a little bit and I'm like mmm.

569
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,338
Speaker 0: Maybe I will turn on the air conditioner.

570
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,202
Speaker 0: Maybe right?

571
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:28,764
Speaker 0: That's how hot.

572
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:29,728
Speaker 0: it is crazy hot.

573
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:39,469
Speaker 0: So Do you want a fan to be blowing on you or do you want a fan to be aimed blowing away from you?

574
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:47,190
Speaker 1: All right, so that is actually a difficult question depending on a lot of very specific circumstances, but we're gonna skip all that.

575
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:56,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in general you just want air to be moving over or through Whatever the surface is that you're using to distribute that heat.

576
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:57,069
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

577
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,757
Speaker 0: So, you know you got you're the CPU.

578
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:02,684
Speaker 0: your heatsink is your skins, right?

579
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,630
Speaker 0: You just got to have air moving across.

580
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:11,490
Speaker 0: Yep, right, you know if you'd aim your fan go out the window to try to get the hot air out of your room.

581
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:21,470
Speaker 0: You know that means the cold the new fresh air is gonna be like sucked into your room through like all the not airtight parts of Your room right like underneath your front door and stuff.

582
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:29,455
Speaker 1: Yep So you basically need a fan on the CPU directing air from the water area of your case Into and then out of that Heating.

583
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:30,764
Speaker 0: so it's the same thing with a computer.

584
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,650
Speaker 0: we think about the box.

585
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:39,510
Speaker 0: Your computer is in your case as a room and the CPU is the person in the room Right in the outside is cold and the inside is hot.

586
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:45,307
Speaker 0: You got to have some fans definitely the top fan aiming up blowing the hot air out.

587
00:38:45,328 --> 00:38:47,788
Speaker 0: cuz hot air rises Right, you got to get the hot air out of the box.

588
00:38:48,371 --> 00:39:01,850
Speaker 0: You also got to bring the cool air that's in the room outside the box into the box you have the in intake fans and Outtake fans because when you get that cool air from your room blowing right on to the CPU the CPU goes.

589
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,948
Speaker 0: Now a lot of the same way you go.

590
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:12,380
Speaker 1: Just have the power supply would have its own fan drawing air from inside the case And skicking out the back and we'll have matters.

591
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:14,990
Speaker 1: usually didn't have any other case fans?

592
00:39:15,592 --> 00:39:16,235
Speaker 0: No, usually not.

593
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:19,910
Speaker 1: if they did they maybe had an intake fan in the front someone.

594
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,370
Speaker 0: I don't think my apple 2gs has any fans whatsoever.

595
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:29,193
Speaker 1: My 486 had one intake fan on the front and the PSU was the exhaust fan on the back and it was roughly a static Pressure case.

596
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:32,186
Speaker 0: I think the 486 only had PSU fans.

597
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,230
Speaker 0: I don't think had any other fan.

598
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,437
Speaker 1: I definitely had an intake fan.

599
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:38,236
Speaker 1: cuz I would I would take it apart and dust the hell out of it Dog hair, right?

600
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:40,224
Speaker 0: So that's the other problem, right?

601
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,970
Speaker 0: We talked about dust before right?

602
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,749
Speaker 0: But once you get these fans going on dust becomes a big issue.

603
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:52,630
Speaker 1: now It's less dust than if you just have it out in the open But you're still taking air from the room and pushing it into a closed box.

604
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:55,509
Speaker 0: So all the dust in your room gets sucked in by this fan.

605
00:39:55,992 --> 00:40:03,604
Speaker 0: So on all your fans that suck air in you need to put filters Right to keep the dust out and then you had to clean those filters once in a while.

606
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:08,987
Speaker 0: and I can tell you I have filters On my computer on all my intake fans and my computer is so dust-free.

607
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,768
Speaker 0: when I open it It looks like it looks almost new.

608
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:12,495
Speaker 1: I have some old.

609
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:21,390
Speaker 1: most people did not put filters on their computer intakes unless they were nerds who made custom computers Only recently have a lot of like in the last five or six years of most cases.

610
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, all modern cases will come with filters.

611
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,870
Speaker 1: But I've noticed pre-built computers pretty much never do and a lot of pre-built computers still use negative pressure.

612
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:35,570
Speaker 1: So everything we're talking about what nerds will say is do you have a positive pressure case or a negative pressure case, right?

613
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,884
Speaker 0: So positive pressure means that you got more air being sucked into the box.

614
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,610
Speaker 0: then you have pushing out.

615
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:48,803
Speaker 0: So your fans that spit air out are not pushing out as many Cubic feet per second of air as the fans that push air in.

616
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:59,212
Speaker 0: so now the air pressure inside The box is higher than the air pressure outside the box Which means dust can't like, you know get sucked in through like the crevices in the side of the case Cuz.

617
00:40:59,312 --> 00:41:02,150
Speaker 0: air is getting, you know pushed out of those holes, right?

618
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,058
Speaker 0: So nothing's gonna come in there now.

619
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:12,490
Speaker 1: in my experience people used to argue and I've I've argued on both sides of this based on experience over the years if they're in the absence of any filters.

620
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:18,370
Speaker 1: A lot of people argue that positive pressure still reduces internal dust as opposed to negative pressure.

621
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:26,530
Speaker 1: Some people will argue the opposite and I have found over the course of my entire life that actually that is so highly situational.

622
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,970
Speaker 1: That's very difficult to make a broad judgment, right?

623
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,757
Speaker 0: Now really negative pressure would be.

624
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:36,722
Speaker 0: you got so many so many fans in your computer spitting air out That the air just gets sucked in from the outside.

625
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:45,715
Speaker 0: the pressure inside your computer is so low And now all this cool air is getting just like pulled into the computer on its own and you think oh both of those sound Kind of good, which one do I want?

626
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,570
Speaker 0: and the answer is you want positive be only want a little bit positive, right?

627
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,377
Speaker 0: You don't want to be like super positive Because that's that causes problems.

628
00:41:54,437 --> 00:42:01,502
Speaker 0: all the fans that are trying to suck air in and out fighting against each other Right, like if you had two fans both trying to pull air out.

629
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,710
Speaker 0: It's like they're pulling against each other, right?

630
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,730
Speaker 0: There's like, you know, the air sort of connects them like a rope, you know physics.

631
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:16,189
Speaker 0: So, you know, you don't have too much positive or too much negative, but you want slightly positive so that you don't get dust You know pushing its way into the holes.

632
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,377
Speaker 1: So let's talk practical.

633
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:26,278
Speaker 1: the reality is in the older days You really had to think a lot about how you're gonna route your air and how you gonna where you gonna put all your stupid ribbon Gables and all this nonsense, but now you

634
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,312
Speaker 0: buy a case that had like a whole bunch of fan holes and no fans Like.

635
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:32,030
Speaker 0: well, do I put fans on all these holes and which direction do I point them?

636
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:39,650
Speaker 1: And nowadays pretty much buy a modern computer case from one of the modern companies that sells to nerds and everything is already set up.

637
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,702
Speaker 1: Yep The fans will all be pointing in the right direction and just do what the case says.

638
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,146
Speaker 0: almost everything these days.

639
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:46,974
Speaker 0: a standard mid tower case At least right.

640
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:51,276
Speaker 0: if you buy not standard mid tower case, it's gonna be weird But a standard mid tower case right.

641
00:42:51,316 --> 00:43:00,552
Speaker 1: your PSU is gonna have an intake and an outtake fan on its own and your PSU is Gonna be in the back bottom of the case, which is the opposite of how computers used to be used to be in the top Back.

642
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:01,116
Speaker 0: Yeah.

643
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,747
Speaker 0: Anyway, and it's gonna just deal with itself.

644
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:07,186
Speaker 0: No problem Right, the GPU is gonna have fans built into it that are appropriate to itself.

645
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:08,070
Speaker 0: Just let it do its thing.

646
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,580
Speaker 1: We'll talk a little bit about the three kinds of GPU fans.

647
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:25,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, your CPU will have a Cooler that comes with it and if it doesn't buy a very standard one There's no reason to get one of those ginormous stupid ones unless You're overclocking which you shouldn't do well

648
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:32,284
Speaker 1: or so the the high-end Normal i7 chip today the normal i7 the highest one does

649
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:33,689
Speaker 0: no longer comes with the heatsink.

650
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,090
Speaker 1: Yep So you have to buy an aftermarket heatsink.

651
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,050
Speaker 1: That's correct and the chip will just perform better if you cool it more up to a certain point.

652
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,332
Speaker 1: Bigger heatsink.

653
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not a matter of overclocking.

654
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:44,301
Speaker 0: That's just how it is.

655
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,550
Speaker 1: Well, arguably it's overclocking because it has the spec.

656
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:50,099
Speaker 0: It's not about a semantic argument.

657
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:50,743
Speaker 0: The point is you're not.

658
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:55,450
Speaker 0: when I say overclocking I mean going be trying to push the chip beyond its spec, right?

659
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,370
Speaker 0: It says it's gonna go this fast and you try to make it go even faster than advertised.

660
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,981
Speaker 0: Right that auto scaling with temperature thing is advertised.

661
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:03,663
Speaker 0: Therefore.

662
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:06,071
Speaker 1: It's not overclocking what I'm running out right now Let's see.

663
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:10,167
Speaker 1: So right now my 4 gigahertz CPU is running at.

664
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:14,196
Speaker 1: that's my RAM Maximum speed 4 gigahertz current speed.

665
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:19,150
Speaker 1: It's - clocked down to under a gigahertz cuz I ain't doing much right anyway.

666
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:22,723
Speaker 0: So, you know get if it comes with a heatsink just use that.

667
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,830
Speaker 0: if not get a real standard one.

668
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:27,474
Speaker 0: Get like one with five stars a new egg But nothing ridiculous.

669
00:44:27,514 --> 00:44:28,618
Speaker 0: that like messes you up right.

670
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:40,193
Speaker 0: and then your case if standard mid-tower case is what we're talking about here Is probably gonna have to intake fans in the front Outtake fan on the top and an exhaust fan on the top All right, and the

671
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:41,057
Speaker 1: CPU

672
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:48,219
Speaker 0: all right and an exhaust fan on the back aiming out Yep And that's gonna be even right for fans to in To out the CPU fan.

673
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:50,510
Speaker 0: the GPU has its own fans and the PSU has own fan.

674
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,550
Speaker 0: Now the PS now is enough to cool a modern computer well enough to function.

675
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:57,861
Speaker 1: I've seen two common designs on the PSU though.

676
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:59,287
Speaker 1: Some of them will put the PSU in.

677
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:04,744
Speaker 1: So the PSU is itself static pressure meaning it doesn't affect the pressure right.

678
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:08,797
Speaker 0: a lot of cases these days have it in like a Separate compartment where it doesn't affect the rest.

679
00:45:08,817 --> 00:45:12,109
Speaker 1: like my PSU sucks in from the bottom outside and out the back.

680
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:13,433
Speaker 0: That's a good way.

681
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:15,359
Speaker 1: It's its own loop, but other ones.

682
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,412
Speaker 0: make sure the filter on the bond will act as an Exhaust fan.

683
00:45:19,472 --> 00:45:25,250
Speaker 1: so if this PSU is drawing air from the inside of the case it counts as an exhaust fan.

684
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,150
Speaker 1: You got to take that into account.

685
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:29,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, but then you're pulling hot computer air into your PSU.

686
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,409
Speaker 0: So make sure you got a real good PSU that can tolerate that hot air.

687
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:41,770
Speaker 1: Yep Now in the old days used to worry about things especially though with like old and like the AMD chips You would want to worry about like the idea of impinging air flow.

688
00:45:42,192 --> 00:45:52,510
Speaker 1: So you could often make an old case cooler by having the top fan Coming in instead of going out because you'll have better heat exchange there and then have an exhaust fan in the bottom.

689
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:54,904
Speaker 1: None of that nonsense matters anymore.

690
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:57,595
Speaker 1: Just do what the cases do And buy a reputable case.

691
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,426
Speaker 0: So another thing that's happened recently is back.

692
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:01,650
Speaker 0: water cooling is not new.

693
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:03,146
Speaker 0: I've been seeing water cooling since the 90s.

694
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:09,679
Speaker 1: It used to be only for overclockers and nerds for whom the water cooling is itself And it was always a custom thing.

695
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,130
Speaker 0: like you would buy hoses you would buy a pump, right?

696
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,089
Speaker 0: You'd like, you know You would mod your case to attach the pump and get power to it.

697
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:17,516
Speaker 0: You'd like fill it with like you get.

698
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:18,359
Speaker 0: you wouldn't use water.

699
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:23,830
Speaker 0: you do some like sort of cooling liquid and like you People would mess up and get their computers wet and shit, right?

700
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:30,366
Speaker 0: But more recently this has become a thing that you can do very easily and perhaps even should.

701
00:46:30,446 --> 00:46:30,667
Speaker 0: right.

702
00:46:31,008 --> 00:46:44,870
Speaker 0: if you are building a Computer and you are building something that is top of the line like, you know an a-plus computer like you want horsepower You can buy these cool liquid coolers that come with the case and fit in it perfectly.

703
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:49,130
Speaker 0: Require, no difficult setup like the liquids already in there, right?

704
00:46:50,013 --> 00:46:51,181
Speaker 0: The hoses are already attached.

705
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:52,389
Speaker 0: You don't got to worry about anything.

706
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:59,810
Speaker 0: This is basically a radiator and a heatsink part and you just put the radiator in the case where it belongs.

707
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:07,110
Speaker 1: It just fits in there perfectly and then and the manufacturer will tell you based on the case what direction the fan should point.

708
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:09,377
Speaker 0: Everything is just automatic.

709
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:16,365
Speaker 0: and then you take instead of putting a heatsink on your CPU You just take the thing on the other end of the hoses and put that on your CPU.

710
00:47:17,088 --> 00:47:17,630
Speaker 0: and there you go.

711
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,750
Speaker 0: You've got this now radiator thing which it comes with fans.

712
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:28,416
Speaker 1: It's just like all pre-packaged totally easy and the fact that it's liquid cooling doesn't really matter because all this is The.

713
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,270
Speaker 1: it's not a heat pipe But it's doing the same kind of thing.

714
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:39,041
Speaker 1: All it's doing is taking the heat from the CPU and instead of having the heatsink be right there It's sending it to a heatsink that's far away.

715
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:41,010
Speaker 0: a big heatsink on the front of the case.

716
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're too big-ass fans on it.

717
00:47:43,352 --> 00:47:50,168
Speaker 1: A little heatsink on your CPU CPUs heatsink right at the edge of the case instead of like in the middle of all.

718
00:47:50,188 --> 00:47:50,410
Speaker 1: your not.

719
00:47:50,811 --> 00:47:58,108
Speaker 0: And you got these intake fans pulling the cold air from outside the case right onto that heatsink and that's like Crazy cool in that CP.

720
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:07,909
Speaker 1: now ideally if you really wanted to make this like super optimal the right way to do that would be to have the heatsink with You know be entirely outside of the case just in its own loop.

721
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:12,069
Speaker 1: The only reason we don't do that is silly is because that's a pain in the ass for a lot of reasons.

722
00:48:12,652 --> 00:48:21,250
Speaker 0: So basically if you want to go crazy, you can you know have like a refrigerator where the compressor Send the liquid out into a compressor and like cool it off, right?

723
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,981
Speaker 1: So but the generally the way these things work.

724
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:29,149
Speaker 1: if you do unless you're doing something crazy You only need one of these and you're really only needed for the CPU.

725
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:41,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it'll draw air cold air from your room into the case warming it up by cooling the CPU But then that air in the case will be blown out through your normal cooling loop with the fans.

726
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:44,783
Speaker 0: The best part about this right is something we didn't talk about yet.

727
00:48:44,843 --> 00:48:46,490
Speaker 0: Is that it's way quiet, right?

728
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:48,260
Speaker 0: It's like you're already gonna have.

729
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:54,453
Speaker 0: if you have a fan on your CPU That's probably gonna be among your loudest fans except for maybe your GPU fan Which we'll get to.

730
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:59,170
Speaker 0: and if you're basically use liquid cooling you eliminate that sound a hundred percent, right?

731
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,750
Speaker 0: Even if you get the quietest fan in the world, it's not as quiet as no fan.

732
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:03,937
Speaker 0: So fan.

733
00:49:04,017 --> 00:49:06,150
Speaker 0: you're gonna have those two intake fans on the front.

734
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:11,117
Speaker 0: Anyway, whether you got using liquid or not So you just eliminated a whole fan.

735
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:12,762
Speaker 0: you were saving so much noise.

736
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:20,244
Speaker 1: the only other where the fans on the heatsink With the liquid cooling because they're not right next to CPU can be way bigger.

737
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:24,719
Speaker 1: and the two things that influence how loud a fan Are the faster it is louder it is.

738
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,436
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the bigger it is the quieter It is because it can move slower.

739
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:33,550
Speaker 1: and by moving slower because as bigger fins move the same amount of air.

740
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:41,226
Speaker 0: Fans are measured in like cubic feet per second Like how much how much feet cubic feet of air can the fan push?

741
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:42,150
Speaker 0: you've got a bigger fan.

742
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:43,033
Speaker 0: It spins.

743
00:49:43,254 --> 00:49:47,790
Speaker 0: one time it pushes more air than a little fan spinning like 10. so it can be quiet, right?

744
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,617
Speaker 0: So spinning faster is louder.

745
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:52,528
Speaker 0: bigger fans spin less make less noise.

746
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:57,350
Speaker 0: also Fancy or more expensive fan up with better bearings are quieter.

747
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:00,139
Speaker 1: So there's a reason you buy the $40 fans for your.

748
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:08,710
Speaker 0: if you really the $12 if you really care about quietness You just spend a lot of money and get the highest rated fancy fans like the Noctua's or whatever they are.

749
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, and those are.

750
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:13,247
Speaker 0: I think I put two of those in my htbc because that's a computer.

751
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:18,610
Speaker 0: you want to be quiet And it already had sort of like sad cooling because in a weird htbc case.

752
00:50:18,951 --> 00:50:22,890
Speaker 0: So I wanted to make sure I had really good the best cooling I could get considering limitations.

753
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:28,533
Speaker 0: Yep, so I put two of the fancy Noctua fans in there and like I never hear them ever now It's very important.

754
00:50:28,553 --> 00:50:30,401
Speaker 0: I think they cost me like 20 or 30 bucks.

755
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:30,963
Speaker 1: talk about that.

756
00:50:30,983 --> 00:50:31,365
Speaker 1: They were not.

757
00:50:31,385 --> 00:50:32,530
Speaker 0: they were not the cheapest fans.

758
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,975
Speaker 0: $5 fans like.

759
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:37,285
Speaker 1: there are two very different use cases there for the htbc use case.

760
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:42,267
Speaker 1: one is plays games Generates heat because it's fast and has a video card use case.

761
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:44,637
Speaker 1: two is You're not playing games on it.

762
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,406
Speaker 1: If you're not playing games on it.

763
00:50:46,466 --> 00:50:47,230
Speaker 1: Don't need a video card.

764
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,394
Speaker 1: It doesn't need to be super fast.

765
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:50,662
Speaker 1: You can go with a completely passive solution.

766
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:53,090
Speaker 1: That'll be literally silence.

767
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:59,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look like an app but inside your tiny case you love this giant ass block of aluminum crap.

768
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:01,238
Speaker 1: Just stick it out of your CPU.

769
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,029
Speaker 1: What do you care, but it won't make any noise?

770
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:07,830
Speaker 1: So there are still reasons to have passive cooling in modern computers.

771
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,876
Speaker 1: It really depends on how much heat you're generating.

772
00:51:10,257 --> 00:51:17,030
Speaker 1: more heat is generated by either having video cards or having fast chips doing stuff All right, so we talked about GPU fans a little bit.

773
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:20,798
Speaker 0: But you know when you go to buy a GPU You're gonna see different kinds of fans on them.

774
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:21,841
Speaker 0: a lot of them these days.

775
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:24,110
Speaker 0: the high-end ones will have like three fans on there.

776
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:29,696
Speaker 0: Well, some of them will have two fans and some of them will have like this weird blowy fan That's totally sideways and different.

777
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:32,388
Speaker 1: So the weird blowy fan or the turbine or whatever.

778
00:51:32,408 --> 00:51:34,315
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm You pretty much don't want that.

779
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:38,650
Speaker 1: Usually those will be called like the founders edition or the reference edition?

780
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,329
Speaker 0: Well, no that has nothing to do with the fan.

781
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:44,410
Speaker 1: Usually though so the reference editions always have that weird turbine fan.

782
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:51,172
Speaker 0: The reference edition is just means that like we're gonna charge you more for this and like this is the original Nvidia design Something.

783
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:59,210
Speaker 1: but as best I can tell the only reason they have that weird turbine fan is Because of a convention where the reference editions always have that.

784
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,490
Speaker 1: I think it's like three articles about this.

785
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:06,462
Speaker 0: I've never seen any connection between the fan style and the found.

786
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,030
Speaker 1: every reference edition has the turbine.

787
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:16,703
Speaker 1: Anyway, so and the reason for that is nonsense The turbine fans are one just louder and two.

788
00:52:17,104 --> 00:52:19,050
Speaker 1: they count as an exhaust fan.

789
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,458
Speaker 1: They pull air in from your case.

790
00:52:21,498 --> 00:52:22,261
Speaker 1: Just like that PSU.

791
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:24,950
Speaker 1: I was talking about and blow it out the back, right?

792
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:26,513
Speaker 1: And they suck.

793
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:29,764
Speaker 0: I actually intentionally got the turbine fan on the 1070 in my HTPC.

794
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:35,287
Speaker 0: Cuz the HTPC is way narrow and there's no if I got the regular.

795
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:41,109
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Cuz the right, okay I got the regular two or three fans where the hell they blowing just down.

796
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:49,450
Speaker 0: Cuz it's a. it's a weird case where the video card is like sideways And those fans be blowing at the ground and then the hot air would rise right back into them.

797
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:52,601
Speaker 0: Yep And so I got the blowy fan to make sure it blows out the back.

798
00:52:52,942 --> 00:53:01,298
Speaker 1: now the regular fan the ones you're thinking of where There's like two or three big like case looking fans on it that those are a lot quieter Usually.

799
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:02,590
Speaker 0: yeah, you got three fans on there.

800
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:09,650
Speaker 1: They don't need to spin very fast But they work a lot like an old CPU cooler did in that they're just blowing air inside your case to cool it down.

801
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,008
Speaker 1: So you gotta make sure the case is still getting the hot air out of the.

802
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:22,650
Speaker 0: yeah usually you're gonna have you know cool air coming right across the bottom of the case in the front and out the back and That's gonna go right past that GPU and take that hot air that those plans blow right out the back.

803
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:32,353
Speaker 1: So I would generally recommend Get the fan that had the the GPU that has two or three normal looking fans on it and not the turbine unless you have A good reason to.

804
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:35,524
Speaker 1: the third way to go is passive which is just for like.

805
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:36,166
Speaker 1: like.

806
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,970
Speaker 1: if you're doing passive cooling Why do you even have a video card?

807
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:50,210
Speaker 0: You can probably get away with using your like Intel like a core whatever You know you can get like you know like 1050s and stuff or like you know weaker video cards that can still do stuff that some of them only have like one fan.

808
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:52,358
Speaker 0: You know this you'd be surprised.

809
00:53:52,378 --> 00:53:55,490
Speaker 0: like the kind of video card you can get that's got one fan or no fans.

810
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:59,290
Speaker 0: It is pretty significantly powerful faster even than the integrated graphics.

811
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,615
Speaker 1: But the other kind is.

812
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:13,350
Speaker 1: you do the same thing just like we talked about with liquid cooling the CPU Where there's no fans on the GPU and instead it again Just has a two pipes or two tubes and a separate fin thing to be the heat sink.

813
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:22,230
Speaker 0: So sometimes you can buy a video card that already has this yep Or you can buy a video card and somehow take the fans off and attach one of these which is doable.

814
00:54:22,532 --> 00:54:29,948
Speaker 1: But as I wouldn't recommend that right in general You don't need to liquid cool your GPU if you only have one GPU.

815
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:44,709
Speaker 1: my My straight-up recommendation if you have a fast computer liquid cool the CPU And then the only things generating heat in the case directly are the GPU and all those heat sinks All of your motherboard for all those chips and your RAM.

816
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:51,830
Speaker 0: Let's think about once you you know every when you cool that CPU with the liquid cooling you're helping out the GPU, right?

817
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,282
Speaker 0: There's less heat in the case now, right?

818
00:54:54,443 --> 00:54:55,790
Speaker 0: You're just helping everybody, right?

819
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,995
Speaker 0: So it's like oh the GPU.

820
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:59,687
Speaker 0: you might have been struggling if the CPU is poorly cooled.

821
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:00,390
Speaker 0: heating up this case.

822
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,930
Speaker 1: Yes, the G is pumping hot air directly into your video card.

823
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:08,509
Speaker 0: But now I brought I brought down the case temperature with my superior cooling in another area.

824
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:12,043
Speaker 0: So now the cooling of the GPU is now doing even better.

825
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:18,717
Speaker 1: It's everyone works together now Irrespective of whether or not SLI and multiple video cards is a good idea.

826
00:55:19,439 --> 00:55:20,422
Speaker 1: if you're doing that.

827
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,029
Speaker 1: that is the use case for the liquid cooled GPU.

828
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, and for no other reason.

829
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:28,090
Speaker 0: when you put two video cards next to each other You want two video cards pumping air through each other?

830
00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:31,430
Speaker 0: One of them is gonna be blowing its hot air onto the back of the other one.

831
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:37,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, right You want a liquid cool the one that would be blowing on its friend and let the friend blow on the bottom of the case Or whatever.

832
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:42,810
Speaker 0: right and then that way you protect the bottom card from the card that's next to it now.

833
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:55,054
Speaker 0: That being said I have seen setups at like conventions and packs or whatever where like Ati's got like a booth or something and they got like four GPUs in the same box and they all had fans and they all Work just fine.

834
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:55,878
Speaker 0: It could totally work.

835
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:58,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just probably, you know, not for the best.

836
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:02,688
Speaker 1: So the other cooling that you might hear occasionally a lot of people don't really understand.

837
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:03,110
Speaker 1: with these hours.

838
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:09,550
Speaker 1: You'll see you'll hear about my heat pipe or you'll see like pipes all over your motherboard Which wasn't a thing a long time ago.

839
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,273
Speaker 1: It's happening more and more.

840
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:13,790
Speaker 1: the problem is the chips that do stuff like it, you know in the old days.

841
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:20,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually it's gotten so much more complicated than that, but it also doesn't matter like it's a chipset now.

842
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:27,743
Speaker 1: It used to worry about that a lot because like certain North bridges wouldn't be compatible with certain things But nowadays none of that matters.

843
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:28,650
Speaker 1: you don't worry about it.

844
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,830
Speaker 0: Well, you do have to choose the right chipset, but you don't care which chips are in the set.

845
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,719
Speaker 0: All you got to know is that oh, I got the Z 270.

846
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:34,181
Speaker 0: Okay.

847
00:56:34,201 --> 00:56:38,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got an Intel H whatever it is.

848
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,246
Speaker 0: I know I know what chipset I have.

849
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:40,890
Speaker 0: That's all you got to know.

850
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,309
Speaker 0: You don't got to know what chips are in the chipset.

851
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:48,930
Speaker 1: But all those different parts of the motherboard and the RAM Actually generate a lot of heat these days because a lot's going on in there.

852
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,289
Speaker 0: They don't generate so much heat that they need a fan of their own.

853
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,617
Speaker 1: But they need heat sink.

854
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,577
Speaker 0: the motherboards thin at the mother But the motherboard includes those right.

855
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:58,423
Speaker 0: they're gonna just have heat sinks on them.

856
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:01,952
Speaker 0: Yeah already built into the motherboard You don't even think about it It's just there.

857
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:07,561
Speaker 1: but if you see all those pipes all those are doing is they're doing what the liquid cool Would do but they're passive.

858
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:19,516
Speaker 1: instead of having a pump Literally pumping liquid through the heat sink, you know Through all these channels inside of it and through all these channels on the puck on top of the CPU They're passive.

859
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:28,349
Speaker 1: They basically will have a liquid evaporating and moving to one end of the pipe and it'll transfer the heat from the hot side to the cold side right.

860
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:33,633
Speaker 0: you got a Whole bunch of chips in a set and some of those chips are gonna be hotter than others depending on what's going on with The computer.

861
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:50,350
Speaker 0: and so it's like oh you got this heat sink on this one chip But it's not doing much because that chips not hot But meanwhile this other chip is crazy hot right now and it's heat sink is like, you know It's adding it's gonna be adequate But why not link it together with these other heat sinks and that way they can all sort of share the load.

862
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:58,610
Speaker 0: It also means long as they don't all get crazy hot at once Each one of them is now being cooled better than it otherwise would be and now your computer lasts longer.

863
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:04,190
Speaker 1: It's also important because you'll often have an area of the motherboard that's further away from stuff.

864
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,297
Speaker 1: We have more room to put a big heat sink But the area that's actually hot.

865
00:58:08,678 --> 00:58:11,647
Speaker 1: you can't put a bunch of heat sinks and crap there because proximity matters.

866
00:58:11,707 --> 00:58:17,084
Speaker 1: computers are so performant These days that the distance between components actually does matter.

867
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:27,109
Speaker 1: That's why they design them the way they do You know pump all that heat from the hot area to a further away less valuable real estate on the motherboard And that's you can have the heat sink some fancy motherboards.

868
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:43,090
Speaker 1: So because basically if you're doing a super high performance computer and you've got the you know The second GPU with liquid cooling and the CPU with liquid cooling at that point You're better off having both of those use the same cooling loop and that's when the complicated crap happens.

869
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,890
Speaker 0: Yeah that you had to do effort to make that happen.

870
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,197
Speaker 0: That's not something you can just buy easily because if

871
00:58:47,217 --> 00:59:00,239
Speaker 1: you're going that road some motherboards will actually have on the motherboard two little headers And you plug those into your cooling loop and the same thing that's cool in the CPU in the GPU Will also cool all the things on the motherboard.

872
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:02,285
Speaker 1: There's channels built into the motherboard.

873
00:59:02,826 --> 00:59:04,070
Speaker 1: That is crazy nonsense.

874
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,200
Speaker 1: You probably don't need anything like that.

875
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,510
Speaker 0: It's like there's all this stuff and you think do I need that?

876
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:09,791
Speaker 0: It's like.

877
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,064
Speaker 0: no that's just for people who like make this their hobby.

878
00:59:12,124 --> 00:59:13,090
Speaker 0: It's not for normal people.

879
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,419
Speaker 1: Yep, but don't be afraid of liquid cooling.

880
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:21,642
Speaker 1: I highly recommend if you have a modern fast computer and You're the CPU you buy doesn't come with a heatsink.

881
00:59:21,964 --> 00:59:23,229
Speaker 1: buy the liquid cooling one.

882
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:30,058
Speaker 0: If you can't make sure you get a case and the cooling thing that go together Yeah All the same manufacturer from the same company.

883
00:59:30,118 --> 00:59:35,409
Speaker 0: if you try to buy like one liquid coolie thing and put it in a different case You're gonna have a bad time, right?

884
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:36,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, these things are not.

885
00:59:36,714 --> 00:59:39,890
Speaker 0: there's not like a standard for these so much as there is for other things.

886
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:45,249
Speaker 0: So you want to make sure you get a nice, you know a set pair and everything will go very easily for you.

887
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:55,177
Speaker 1: And otherwise, I mean as long as you buy a nice case Cables got small you don't have to worry about ribbon cables like literally Redirecting air and causing hot spots.

888
00:59:55,277 --> 00:59:58,170
Speaker 0: modern cases like show you where you're supposed to route the cables.

889
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,283
Speaker 0: But even if you just do a big mess, it's not they're not.

890
01:00:01,444 --> 01:00:03,010
Speaker 0: I guess it's not a big ribbon cable.

891
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,156
Speaker 0: It's not blocking anything.

892
01:00:04,216 --> 01:00:11,208
Speaker 0: It's really not going to affect your airflow that much Yep, and nowadays all the PS use I have like they let you they're modular.

893
01:00:11,228 --> 01:00:11,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, they let you.

894
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:13,636
Speaker 1: Don't plug them in.

895
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,590
Speaker 0: you don't have a big mess of cables in there hurting you.

896
01:00:15,891 --> 01:00:22,420
Speaker 1: Actually cut a bunch of cables off of a PSU a long time ago And I sort of like wrapped him up and got him out of the way.

897
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:29,347
Speaker 1: and I used to cut ribbon cables for my hard Drives, you know take a razor and cut along all the lines and they could bundle them.

898
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,800
Speaker 0: So they'd be out of the way Yeah, but weren't they flat for a reason?

899
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:33,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were it was it was they did.

900
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,834
Speaker 1: Sometimes it worked sometimes it did.

901
01:00:34,854 --> 01:00:39,450
Speaker 0: there were definitely some ribbon cables that I got I remember like towards the latter days of IDE.

902
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:51,550
Speaker 0: I would buy you buy a hard drive to come with a ribbon cable that was already bundled like yeah, and I'm like, alright Whatever it worked and in terms of hard drives and everything like they do generate heat.

903
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:59,770
Speaker 0: They usually every everything generates heat but like SSDs even magnetic drives They don't need to be cooled, right?

904
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:07,537
Speaker 1: Well modern cases will place them in in in areas where they will get enough cooling As long as you do what the case said to do.

905
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:08,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

906
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:11,070
Speaker 0: you don't have to put fans on them or anything.

907
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,958
Speaker 0: It's like, you know back in the day that used to be.

908
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:17,834
Speaker 0: I think I actually did have at one point This super long ago.

909
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:19,358
Speaker 0: This is the Pentium three, right?

910
01:01:19,378 --> 01:01:27,143
Speaker 0: No had which at the time was crazy a sea gate 7200 rpm drive.

911
01:01:27,445 --> 01:01:34,647
Speaker 0: Oh Right, so that was so many rpms then oh my god, I think it was four gigabytes this drive.

912
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:38,656
Speaker 0: it was insane And you know that was.

913
01:01:38,716 --> 01:01:40,120
Speaker 0: that was too fast.

914
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,965
Speaker 0: this needed its own cooling right.

915
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:45,060
Speaker 0: you couldn't just put this drive in with the other Drive, this is gonna be like set on fire.

916
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,730
Speaker 0: I wanted this drive to last a long time.

917
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,577
Speaker 0: It was expensive and high quality.

918
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,670
Speaker 0: So, you know top of the line magnetic hard drive here.

919
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:54,670
Speaker 0: So I bought a thing that was a giant heatsink.

920
01:01:55,151 --> 01:02:05,950
Speaker 0: You put the hard drive in there and had fans two little fans on the front and then you put the hard drive into a five And a quarter slot instead of a three and a half slot and now that hard drive is gonna be so cool.

921
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:14,523
Speaker 1: Most cases will just have the hard drives in a place where the intake fans Like that air will just kind of wash over room and that'll be enough.

922
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:18,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I Probably didn't need that thing back in the day, but I had it.

923
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:24,709
Speaker 1: Yeah well also back then like cases sucked and there were a lot of hot spots and like that was a that's still a big.

924
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:32,810
Speaker 0: I Don't think I needed to put my three and a half inch hard drive in the five and a quarter slot with its own Enormous heatsink with its own two tiny fans.

925
01:02:33,293 --> 01:02:34,664
Speaker 1: It's hard to say like I'd like.

926
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:35,390
Speaker 0: we know a lot.

927
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:38,061
Speaker 0: I couldn't say I could have saved that money when I was younger.

928
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,389
Speaker 0: maybe used it on something better like food.

929
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:44,739
Speaker 1: So, uh, it's actually like.

930
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:56,096
Speaker 1: it's interesting how it got more complicated But at the same time like just in the last four or five years, I'd say in terms of actually building computers It's way easier.

931
01:02:56,156 --> 01:03:06,215
Speaker 1: I think the worst time was about six to ten years ago Where you started to have advanced cooling needs, but there weren't a lot of good off-the-shelf Solutions.

932
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:09,050
Speaker 0: the need the needs and the problem are more difficult than ever.

933
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,749
Speaker 0: There's more heat than ever but the products you can buy just solve the problem for you.

934
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:17,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you don't need to think about it or work hard at it You didn't.

935
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:23,950
Speaker 1: you know like you used to is you only need to work hard if you're already doing weird stuff and you're already Edging into set like hobbyist nonsense, right?

936
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:29,410
Speaker 0: If you're not a hobbyist like the off-the-shelf stuff just by the default and it's gonna work great and it's totally awesome.

937
01:03:29,715 --> 01:03:35,927
Speaker 1: but seriously Positive pressure and have intake filters if your computer doesn't.

938
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:36,610
Speaker 1: not too positive.

939
01:03:36,951 --> 01:03:38,419
Speaker 0: Oh just slightly positive.

940
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:44,822
Speaker 1: if your computer does not have intake filters You should dust the hell out of your computer with an air And get filters on there.

941
01:03:44,842 --> 01:03:48,199
Speaker 0: and if you don't have filters You can just stretch some pantyhose over the front of those intake fan.

942
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,982
Speaker 1: Yeah, that works.

943
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:50,026
Speaker 0: It works crazy.

944
01:03:50,066 --> 01:03:50,970
Speaker 0: Well, and it's so cheap.

945
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:53,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like nothing like that changed my life.

946
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:57,667
Speaker 1: I did that to my computer two times ago, and then I never had to dust it again.

947
01:03:57,687 --> 01:03:58,330
Speaker 1: It was just amazing.

948
01:03:58,551 --> 01:03:59,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, just every month.

949
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:01,805
Speaker 1: I would literally I didn't even clean the pantyhose.

950
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:02,709
Speaker 1: I would just replace it.

951
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:04,519
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, I have filters.

952
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,216
Speaker 0: the filters on my computers are Magnated on so are mine.

953
01:04:08,236 --> 01:04:15,310
Speaker 0: They're just like this you turn your computer off you peel them off you go outside You shake them and yep, I just whack them on the balcony all the dust falls off.

954
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:19,668
Speaker 0: You can also take a can of compressed air and spray them and then just slap them back on there.

955
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:21,516
Speaker 0: done Do it like once every few months.

956
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,288
Speaker 1: Yep, and in terms of just you know, I'll mention it.

957
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,720
Speaker 1: laptops They cool themselves.

958
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:28,510
Speaker 0: don't mess with the laptop cooling.

959
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:32,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you see a laptop is blowing a lot and is making a lot of noise.

960
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,270
Speaker 0: I don't buy that laptop.

961
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:35,318
Speaker 0: That's a crappy one.

962
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:36,629
Speaker 0: That's bad cooling design.

963
01:04:36,911 --> 01:04:37,573
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it like.

964
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:38,015
Speaker 1: so might like.

965
01:04:38,035 --> 01:04:41,570
Speaker 1: I have a Lenovo x230 which is still a great laptop like even today like it'll place.

966
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,049
Speaker 1: If six, okay, which is still kind of amazing me that'll totally pull that off.

967
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:51,688
Speaker 1: but if I start playing Civ six and that's this fan that usually isn't spinning and suddenly it spins.

968
01:04:51,728 --> 01:04:59,128
Speaker 1: you hear this like An air hot enough to be uncomfortable is coming out of the side of this tiny laptop.

969
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,913
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That's not good.

970
01:05:01,154 --> 01:05:01,375
Speaker 1: Yeah.

971
01:05:01,415 --> 01:05:02,940
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it's gonna die.

972
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:03,863
Speaker 1: I think it'll be fine.

973
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:04,344
Speaker 0: It's good day.

974
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,714
Speaker 1: It's uh, it'll be fine It's gonna die.

975
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:07,981
Speaker 1: that laptop is so old.

976
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:08,826
Speaker 1: Like I'm shocked.

977
01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:09,410
Speaker 1: It still works.

978
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:17,860
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
