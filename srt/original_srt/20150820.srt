1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,072
Speaker 1: It's Thursday August 20th 2015.

2
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,579
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,397
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about cookies the good kind.

4
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,398
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:31,510
Speaker 0: So I got an as holds, you know my files?

6
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I got a crappy like old netgear to Bayness sitting right up there above the geek nights rig.

7
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:41,270
Speaker 0: So like last night I go to drag a file over to it and in Windows is like disconnected.

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,819
Speaker 0: I'm like I was working recently.

9
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,670
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh it must you know, it must just be that thing.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,830
Speaker 0: We're like, you know you restart and yeah, it's like oh one or more drives are not connected.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,750
Speaker 1: You click on and then like, okay, we're good now, right exactly click on it.

12
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,432
Speaker 0: It's not good now.

13
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:59,230
Speaker 0: So turn around and look at it and it's off and I'm like, I didn't turn you off.

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,993
Speaker 1: That's weird.

15
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:04,388
Speaker 0: So I got to push the button and I push the button and literally nothing happened.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,213
Speaker 0: No noise.

17
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,016
Speaker 0: No nothing.

18
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:08,080
Speaker 1: What kind of NAS is this?

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,630
Speaker 0: a ready NAS NV plus, okay So it served me well for many years.

20
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my neck here is like the shittest tear netgear and it's been going non-stop for a long time.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,978
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's been like four or five years.

22
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:20,922
Speaker 0: the warranty is way over.

23
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:23,919
Speaker 1: so I have lost two drives in mine though I haven't lost any.

24
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:38,210
Speaker 0: so anyway When you push a power button on something and you check to make sure it's plugged in and you flick, you know If absolutely nothing happens the odds are the thing that is broken is the power supply.

25
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,905
Speaker 1: Yep, now you want you know why Luke needed those power converters, right?

26
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:45,349
Speaker 0: So I'm like well That sucks.

27
00:01:46,792 --> 00:01:47,697
Speaker 0: What can I do about this?

28
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:53,105
Speaker 0: I go online and apparently not my version But there's a previous version of the similar NAS.

29
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:59,650
Speaker 0: the same model line Had serious problems with especially heat and the power supply dying.

30
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,368
Speaker 1: You keep your apartment warmer than I keep.

31
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:08,588
Speaker 0: well I don't even turn the air conditioning on when I'm not home But I don't turn the NAS off ever so it must have died from the heat while I was at work.

32
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,250
Speaker 0: Yep So, I mean it's a less common problem with my much newer model.

33
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,560
Speaker 0: I mean it lasted five years.

34
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:15,810
Speaker 0: the other ones apparently were like dying.

35
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:21,587
Speaker 1: But also honestly in consumer level stuff like power supply goes on everything eventually.

36
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:24,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm like well What can I do about this?

37
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:27,210
Speaker 0: Can I buy the same exact NAS and move my drives over?

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,569
Speaker 1: See now this is the thing.

39
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,779
Speaker 1: This is why I hate consumer level.

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,274
Speaker 1: NAS is so much but at the same time I don't really trust Robo cuz.

41
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:37,424
Speaker 1: that's like the Apple of NAS is like your NAS.

42
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,070
Speaker 1: you have to us have that question.

43
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:42,010
Speaker 1: Well, can I use a suit up with a real NAS?

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,590
Speaker 1: You just fucking pull all the drives out put it in any equivalent NAS and it just immediately starts working.

45
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,789
Speaker 0: So yeah, if I can get the same NAS with the same firmware that would work.

46
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,096
Speaker 1: No, you don't even need the same.

47
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,830
Speaker 1: you just need like a compelling anything in this power server raid.

48
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,910
Speaker 1: Whatever series will work like I don't even care.

49
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:07,469
Speaker 0: But anyway, I could also get this software that's pretty easy to get and plug all the drives into a computer Tell it which one was which and that and be able to save the data that way.

50
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,705
Speaker 0: Yep, or I could fix this NAS better plate probably 90% chance.

51
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,430
Speaker 0: replacing the power supply will fix it, right?

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,340
Speaker 0: So I went online and this is such a common problem.

53
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,990
Speaker 0: There's plenty of third-party power supplies available.

54
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:25,626
Speaker 0: So I ordered one and assuming it works I'll be alright, but should I then?

55
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:29,019
Speaker 0: Try to replace the NAS with a newer one?

56
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,086
Speaker 0: that I would right, you know what I do.

57
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:36,050
Speaker 0: cuz I'm thinking about doing this I'm glad I bought some bigger drives for my main PC on the Windows 10 upgrade recently.

58
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,222
Speaker 0: I have been planning but it's a lot of money to buy a new NAS.

59
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,310
Speaker 0: I don't want to spend on for no reason.

60
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,557
Speaker 1: It's even worse if you want to.

61
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:49,049
Speaker 1: I mean the power supply was already like a hundred bucks Yeah, so if you want a goodness like even not a professional one.

62
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,096
Speaker 1: But so like here's the problem.

63
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:54,648
Speaker 1: drobos are just faster in a lot of ways and they work a lot better.

64
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,839
Speaker 0: in a lot of The network one is expensive.

65
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:57,964
Speaker 1: No, the network one is cheap.

66
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,130
Speaker 1: The Daz one is expensive.

67
00:03:59,471 --> 00:03:59,953
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

68
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,218
Speaker 1: The network one's a few hundred bucks.

69
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,202
Speaker 1: It's not that much more.

70
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,421
Speaker 1: The drives cost way more than I have drives Yeah, but drives are fine.

71
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:12,548
Speaker 1: If a drobo fails The only way to get the data is to get another drobo.

72
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,130
Speaker 0: That's correct.

73
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:21,125
Speaker 1: You cannot get the data in any software any other device Yeah, and it's not a Terry kind of thing because it's not raid.

74
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:21,790
Speaker 1: It's something else.

75
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,285
Speaker 1: Now if the reality is raid is obsolete.

76
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:30,053
Speaker 0: Yeah effectively I mean my NAS is using some nonsense called raid X or whatever Mine is using.

77
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,118
Speaker 1: I have just a straight-up mirror up there.

78
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,800
Speaker 0: Just a mirror.

79
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,602
Speaker 0: Yeah.

80
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,627
Speaker 1: Well, cuz you know what this.

81
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:40,557
Speaker 1: when I got it Space was actually not as cheap as it is now.

82
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:52,430
Speaker 1: This is an old - for two terabyte drives - two three terabyte drives But Like the difference between a four bay and a five bay in terms of speed and reliability is like night and day.

83
00:04:52,551 --> 00:05:01,803
Speaker 1: But the price is way higher for that fifth spot the drobo and Professional NAS is that's one thing the drobo does that like pro NAS is do and like these don't.

84
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:12,049
Speaker 1: you can buy a sixth drive And I'm not to the ones that are just cards as these stick that in the bottom and It won't like use that for redundancy.

85
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:27,777
Speaker 1: It'll just cash the shit out of your data and make it way fast Mm-hmm, but that means buying a weird proprietary NAS from basically the Apple of NASes and then buying five drives and Buying a sixth m.2 drive.

86
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:31,048
Speaker 1: That'll be like a hundred bucks more than like a normal SSD.

87
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:31,490
Speaker 1: say that.

88
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,999
Speaker 0: Why do I need it to be that fast?

89
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,730
Speaker 0: I basically just use it for backups.

90
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,959
Speaker 0: It's just a backup storing place.

91
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,770
Speaker 1: I want to work on video that way.

92
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,870
Speaker 0: I bought fast hard drives and put them in my computer for that.

93
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,301
Speaker 1: So I would only do the caching if I was getting a Daz.

94
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:49,190
Speaker 1: that's a NAS that connects directly to your computer with light.

95
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,229
Speaker 0: It's not a NAS at all.

96
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,201
Speaker 0: It's just an external hard drive or a bunch of external hard drives.

97
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,948
Speaker 0: in a box that looks like one hard drive.

98
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:55,530
Speaker 1: a Daz is.

99
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,150
Speaker 1: Think of it as an external hard drive.

100
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,910
Speaker 1: That's actually like six drives all rated together and like super fast and performant and gigantic.

101
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:05,170
Speaker 1: That's what you do when you're like editing video from that thing.

102
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:08,509
Speaker 0: Drive in my computer that I edit video on yep.

103
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:10,950
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a more Monday topic.

104
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:21,930
Speaker 1: What I'm probably gonna do is as soon as we have some downtime after packs and I edit like the next round of video I'm gonna reinstall windows on an SSD and install a USB 3 thing and keep this computer for another like six or seven months.

105
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:23,515
Speaker 1: Well, I got a new computer.

106
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:30,358
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get a bunch of drives and use the windows redundancy inside the computer Hmm, and that'll be my fast stuff.

107
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:37,010
Speaker 1: and then I'll get some giant maybe like professional Like one of those just enclosures with like eight drives and just I need them.

108
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:41,630
Speaker 1: Well, I'll make that my data store forever and I'll integrate it with glacier.

109
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,070
Speaker 0: I wish I could just faster internet because then I wouldn't even need an as I could just back everything up in the cloud.

110
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:47,058
Speaker 1: Well what I want?

111
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,535
Speaker 1: my ideal situation I've been thinking about this a lot.

112
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:58,448
Speaker 1: just with the way I live my life is have some gigantic Dad like real sand in my apartment sand or like a high-level NAS you need a sand.

113
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,555
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, there's there's a layer between the two.

114
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:17,563
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're going overboard like six seven, whatever drives networks, obviously But obviously then I'd use the API on it to say every six months Just put a snapshot on glacier cuz that shit is so cheap Like glacier is so cheap.

115
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:20,114
Speaker 1: It's almost hilarious Like that's.

116
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:20,796
Speaker 1: that's my deal.

117
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:27,690
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah my ideal stuff the cost of fortune Much an enclosure like that would be like over kill.

118
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:35,000
Speaker 0: Yeah my ideal is having like three CPUs even though we have multi-core CPUs these days and also like ten video cards.

119
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,980
Speaker 0: and It's not my ideal that you or a monitor the has to set up and my house to put it in.

120
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:48,748
Speaker 1: It is my reasonable ideal To have a upper-class NAS in my life.

121
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,208
Speaker 1: So got any news?

122
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,519
Speaker 1: It is Thursday, it's the lounge.

123
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,623
Speaker 1: did you forget your news already?

124
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,290
Speaker 0: No, I mean there wasn't really any good news.

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,089
Speaker 0: So I took a super mainstream news.

126
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:03,095
Speaker 0: Oh, cuz I also have a super mainstream not because I want to talk about the news itself But the topic related to it.

127
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:03,879
Speaker 0: briefly, right?

128
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,007
Speaker 1: I imagine this doesn't involve politics in any way.

129
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:06,750
Speaker 0: involves sports.

130
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:10,179
Speaker 0: Oh this week there was a big news, especially in New York.

131
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,009
Speaker 0: That was like Eli Manning asked for the most money ever.

132
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:17,202
Speaker 0: So Regardless of whether that's true or not, right?

133
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:21,606
Speaker 0: It brings up the topic of Professional athletes getting paid way too much money.

134
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:31,185
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it's already a complicated thing because like football like American football players They're a lot of them are pretty much fucked after they're like late 30s.

135
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,328
Speaker 0: Not a good a coda bag.

136
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,818
Speaker 1: Yeah, what if you're just like the fucking full back?

137
00:08:35,878 --> 00:08:39,370
Speaker 0: just right if your teams don't even have full backs these days?

138
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:46,230
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know a lot of people especially anti-sport nerds is related to our packs panel, you know.

139
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:49,010
Speaker 0: One thing they often bring up is how athletes are overpaid.

140
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,281
Speaker 0: So I just want to address this for a bit.

141
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,290
Speaker 0: First of all, you're a professional athlete.

142
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:59,223
Speaker 0: You pretty much spent your whole life on this one thing Because that's how you'd be only way you could be good enough to do that.

143
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:00,790
Speaker 0: You don't have any other skills.

144
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,662
Speaker 0: There's not like some other job you can get.

145
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:03,930
Speaker 0: that isn't a piece of shit job.

146
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, your degree isn't something worthless.

147
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,307
Speaker 1: probably because you were doing you even have a degree.

148
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:14,281
Speaker 0: Yeah You see you invested all that time like a doctor right a doctor All their whole life into being a doctor.

149
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,910
Speaker 0: it takes years and years and years of practice.

150
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:22,166
Speaker 0: So when they finally become a doctor They need to be paid a lot of money to make up for the fact that they just wasted their whole life on this one thing.

151
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,481
Speaker 0: Also, you can't do it for very long.

152
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:29,923
Speaker 0: You can be a doctor and so you're like an old man Assuming you keep yourself healthy with doctor skills.

153
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:32,816
Speaker 1: a 45 year old football player That's a unicorn if you're.

154
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:37,616
Speaker 0: if you're a football player or even hockey or any kind even baseball You can only do this for a couple years.

155
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:44,350
Speaker 0: You need to make a lot of money in those years so that you can retire And be okay afterwards.

156
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:56,650
Speaker 0: Right and not everyone can like, you know be do awesome stuff afterwards and have a second act unless you're ridiculously You know ridiculously good in the first place especially if you've got, you know, repeated concussion syndrome.

157
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:59,839
Speaker 0: You just played baseball right.

158
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,950
Speaker 0: you made a million dollars a year for 15 years and now you have 15 million dollars.

159
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,790
Speaker 1: I can live on million dollars for the rest of my life from today.

160
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,870
Speaker 0: Sure, but you had to live for those years and you I've had to retire when you're 30 something.

161
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:16,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, now now you can retire now with five million and live the rest of my life.

162
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,230
Speaker 1: just but that's you know.

163
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,075
Speaker 0: You need that right.

164
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,530
Speaker 0: normal people are gonna go to 65 before they retire.

165
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:27,374
Speaker 0: So you're making you know, if you add up all the money you make over time compared to a not ridiculously top-of-the-line Professional athlete.

166
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:28,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're actually making about the same.

167
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,870
Speaker 0: We want to make more money than them in your life.

168
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,608
Speaker 0: Right just from to salary at your job.

169
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,363
Speaker 1: Well, cuz people forget, you know, you look at those salaries of these players.

170
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:37,930
Speaker 1: That's the top players.

171
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,855
Speaker 1: You hear their names of.

172
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,827
Speaker 1: you don't know the names of all the people.

173
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:41,390
Speaker 1: that don't matter.

174
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,272
Speaker 0: They're making one million a year 500 K. Yeah Like.

175
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:49,290
Speaker 1: there are hockey players five years and then they're out of the league and their hockey players are only on the ice and games.

176
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,033
Speaker 1: That don't matter.

177
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:51,840
Speaker 1: There are baseball players who never bat.

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,081
Speaker 1: like.

179
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,727
Speaker 0: there are people who are only in the minor leagues.

180
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:54,490
Speaker 0: That's their whole job.

181
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:55,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

182
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:59,210
Speaker 1: You got to spend time in the minor leagues to even have a chance again into the major leagues.

183
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,936
Speaker 0: Also, you know you look at these athletes.

184
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,461
Speaker 0: They make it so much ridiculous money.

185
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,328
Speaker 0: the owners right.

186
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:11,030
Speaker 0: you think like The athlete getting like 20 million dollars, you know a year or something is is making big bank.

187
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,630
Speaker 0: Hello, the owner has multi billions, right?

188
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:22,030
Speaker 0: And they don't want to pay the athlete who's making them those multi billions an extra million a year.

189
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:29,470
Speaker 0: It's like dude you just if I'm working for someone and they make that but I'm directly like just two steps under them.

190
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:40,759
Speaker 0: right because like quarterback coach owner now general manager owner and they make Literally a thousand times more money than I do They can go fuck themselves and pay me an extra couple million.

191
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,103
Speaker 1: You made me realize something.

192
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,230
Speaker 1: There's something very special about sports.

193
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,569
Speaker 1: I don't know if you're getting at this or not.

194
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:50,306
Speaker 1: So in the modern world the workers do not control the means of production.

195
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,250
Speaker 1: The workers are a byproduct.

196
00:11:52,171 --> 00:12:00,829
Speaker 1: production is performed by technology capital and a small number of experts but in Professional sports there's only so many humans who can play that game.

197
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:06,130
Speaker 0: There are not enough quarterbacks in the NFL for every team to have a quality quarterback.

198
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,010
Speaker 1: Yeah If you are only like 10 NHL teams have a decent goalie, right?

199
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:21,570
Speaker 0: If you are good at this job, that is so incredibly rare for anyone to be good at Well, your labor actually has value and you can demand this large amount of money.

200
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:29,097
Speaker 1: So professional sports in the United States is an industry where full-on communism Probably work out right?

201
00:12:29,137 --> 00:12:32,150
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a reason that you know, you need to have a union for these things, right?

202
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,514
Speaker 0: Because it's like, you know, normally I could go and be like, well, I don't like working here anymore I'll go work somewhere else.

203
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,863
Speaker 0: If you're the hockey goalie.

204
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:41,430
Speaker 0: It's not like you can't work anywhere else.

205
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,515
Speaker 0: you either work in the NHL or The KHS.

206
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,887
Speaker 0: you don't have a choice like football and I'll go play in the XFL, right?

207
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:48,610
Speaker 0: That does not around it.

208
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:49,295
Speaker 1: I know.

209
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,170
Speaker 0: it's like you don't have a choice of where to work.

210
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:57,420
Speaker 0: So you need this union, you know to be very strong and to basically say hey It's not like you can quit and go work somewhere else.

211
00:12:57,762 --> 00:12:59,570
Speaker 0: No competition for your labor.

212
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,576
Speaker 0: You have only one possible employer.

213
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:05,810
Speaker 0: You need to stick it to them and stick it to them hard to get what you deserve.

214
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:15,862
Speaker 1: I think the real problem is with all this is that a lot of people who are young Who literally have no chance of actually being in professional sports.

215
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:17,486
Speaker 0: No chance.

216
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:26,809
Speaker 1: Basically ruin their lives chasing that and Expecting that it's possible when it's probably not it is so that is the main possible is just unlikely, right?

217
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:34,877
Speaker 0: Thousands and thousands and thousands of people attempt it and only a few hundreds make it and the rest of them are Napoleon dynamite's dad Right.

218
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, so.

219
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:39,872
Speaker 0: But all we'll talk don't be getting mad I don't want to.

220
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:40,736
Speaker 0: you know, I don't like giving.

221
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:50,410
Speaker 0: people are getting mad at how much you know Some athletes are getting paid because they actually probably all professional athletes probably deserve way more and you know what?

222
00:13:51,690 --> 00:14:01,279
Speaker 0: When you know 30 50 70 100 thousand people come to watch you work and are willing to pay $100 to watch you work Yeah, all right, then you can get as much money as they.

223
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,970
Speaker 1: I can barely get one person to watch me work.

224
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:04,500
Speaker 1: Yeah,

225
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,231
Speaker 0: right okay, so occasionally

226
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:10,304
Speaker 1: the CEO will like wander over to my office and like look at my shoulder like

227
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:18,556
Speaker 0: things that you are capable of are so Amazing that people are willing to pay to see them right regardless of what it is that you were doing Then you deserve all that money.

228
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:24,257
Speaker 1: it's no different than you know, any other performer who just gave me an idea But I couldn't do it at my job.

229
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:26,967
Speaker 0: No one's gonna say oh man that that you know.

230
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,845
Speaker 0: dancer You know in the ballet is making too much money.

231
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:34,187
Speaker 0: It's like Yeah, I mean it's like a thousand people are willing to pay to see them dance.

232
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:34,710
Speaker 0: They deserve it.

233
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,092
Speaker 1: You know what?

234
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:35,435
Speaker 1: I want to do.

235
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:36,744
Speaker 0: They're so good at what they want to do.

236
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:39,616
Speaker 1: a let's play of Me working for a whole day.

237
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,141
Speaker 1: Like here's my screen.

238
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:42,165
Speaker 1: Here's my face.

239
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:46,073
Speaker 0: This is what I do If only there weren't Security really?

240
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:51,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, so someone who doesn't have those concerns like I would watch Conrad's.

241
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:51,788
Speaker 1: let's play.

242
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:53,497
Speaker 1: Let's work Let's work a thing.

243
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,390
Speaker 0: He's probably type it in passwords to things.

244
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd have to have like a little box you can move around to hide password things.

245
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:07,250
Speaker 1: Anyway, so in other news, there's a pretty good argument going on about this in the forum, so I figured it's actually worth discussing.

246
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,696
Speaker 1: So if you're not aware Ashley Madison is not a person.

247
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:19,578
Speaker 1: it was a person maybe I don't even know is a website and it's still up apparently and it Still has a fact like it still acts like it's real.

248
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,802
Speaker 1: We're basically.

249
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:26,663
Speaker 1: if you are married and want to cheat on your spouse They you can go and make a secret account and pay money.

250
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,310
Speaker 0: You just use any dating site for this.

251
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:33,525
Speaker 1: Well, the idea was that you no one can see your details fully like.

252
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,267
Speaker 1: it's secure.

253
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:35,310
Speaker 1: You can hit a button.

254
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,606
Speaker 0: It's a dating site, but it was specifically designed with this purpose in mind.

255
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:44,783
Speaker 0: having an affair They made some slight changes to it compared to say an okcupider or whatever.

256
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,170
Speaker 1: It is specifically cheat on your wife.

257
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:56,669
Speaker 1: And yes I say cheat on your wife because 80 plus percent of the profiles are men and the people who leaked the data said that Most of the female profiles were fake and made by the company.

258
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:02,269
Speaker 1: So it's a bunch of dudes trying to cheat on their wives and family and failing but paying money.

259
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:07,348
Speaker 1: Okay, and they had a feature where you could pay more money to delete all traces of your profile.

260
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:10,317
Speaker 0: guaranteed Yeah, not only money for that.

261
00:16:10,397 --> 00:16:15,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, she basically signed up and paid money for a service Which will then extort more money out of you.

262
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:15,857
Speaker 0: Yep.

263
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:19,910
Speaker 0: Okay, and yeah, so if you sign up for this you are morons.

264
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,618
Speaker 1: So yeah, you're a best-case scenario.

265
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:27,412
Speaker 1: You're incredibly naive and polyamorous, but most likely you're just a shitbag guy trying to cheat On his wife.

266
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:27,773
Speaker 0: sure.

267
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:30,584
Speaker 0: I mean usually people who are legit polyamorous.

268
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:37,870
Speaker 0: if you go on real dating sites They're just like hey, yeah, you'll see people on there who are like, I'm gonna commit a relationship looking for some fun times.

269
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:41,699

270
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:55,791

Speaker 1: I

273
00:16:56,594 --> 00:17:01,672
Speaker 0: mean I suppose you could just sign up for this if you were really into getting with someone who is married So one

274
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:02,818

291
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,937
Speaker 1: It's just on Pirate Bay Right now.

292
00:17:52,341 --> 00:17:53,309
Speaker 0: just SQL file.

293
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,720
Speaker 1: Yeah text files SQL everything.

294
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,686
Speaker 1: it's like this 12 gigabyte dump.

295
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,030
Speaker 0: I don't need I don't need to dump.

296
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I don't need to dump either.

297
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,252
Speaker 1: You know why?

298
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,061
Speaker 1: cuz like a hundred news sites are pouring through it.

299
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:10,623
Speaker 1: a couple of celebrities have already been not only caught But admitted to it because the evidence is damning.

300
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:23,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I find this all vaguely amusing and There's a pretty good argument in the forum and the argument is thus I don't know we could do a show on this later, but just so you can set the stage This is the kind of thing to think about.

301
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:27,989
Speaker 1: What is the lot like when is activist hacking like this?

302
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,114
Speaker 1: Ethical or a good thing?

303
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:35,210
Speaker 0: because you got you mean that question is so loaded because you have so many overlapping topics here?

304
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:38,690
Speaker 0: Yeah that are bumping into each other and you have to address each of them separately.

305
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:46,890
Speaker 0: Well examples I use because someone was pressing because it's like if you can talk about like well is having affairs like the issues of Having affairs all right is involved here.

306
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:55,369
Speaker 0: So you have to take that out and address that on its own Right, then you have to address just the privacy issues in general the technical issues and they're all separate.

307
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:58,470
Speaker 0: or you Because they're all overlapping here.

308
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:03,230
Speaker 0: It's easy to get confused and it's not easy to discuss it properly.

309
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:09,830
Speaker 1: Like what if I'm gay and I'm trying to cheat on my wife who I don't love with men and I live in Saudi Arabia?

310
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,546
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna die because of this sure so theoretically.

311
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:19,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, so The the argument came down to the angle I was looking at.

312
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:27,209
Speaker 1: was the pure ethics of activist hacking a Fundamental level like that philosophical question because there are three use cases of it.

313
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:35,130
Speaker 0: Well activist hacking includes many activities only only one of which is take a database from someone's website and mature.

314
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,830
Speaker 1: So activist docks hacking like doxing hacking.

315
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,078
Speaker 0: Which is this doxing?

316
00:19:41,118 --> 00:19:43,346
Speaker 0: in this hat you can docks without hacking.

317
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:50,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can have Right, so those are completely separate doing both activist hacking to then release information.

318
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,190
Speaker 1: That is true about people.

319
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,134
Speaker 1: That was hidden.

320
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:56,450
Speaker 1: Okay, and you know, did you say oh well truth is generally good.

321
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,429
Speaker 1: So here's three three examples that are gonna keep you up at night Because this is the argument going on in the forum right now.

322
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:10,594
Speaker 1: The middle example is this where the vast majority of people on this side who actually used it are Undisputable shit bags.

323
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:13,844
Speaker 1: Sure, but some people might not be sure.

324
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:15,368
Speaker 1: So those people might get fucked by this.

325
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,876
Speaker 1: Okay I'm enjoying the hack.

326
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:20,169
Speaker 1: Anyway, even though yeah a few people probably get hurt cuz most of it.

327
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,461
Speaker 1: But anyway on the other side What if the KKK in the entire u.s.

328
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:31,009
Speaker 1: Every chapter you're gonna really close to Godwin here Yeah got hacked and that list just got released?

329
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:37,330
Speaker 1: Does that make the world better or worse to know that say some mayor is actually secretly a member of the KKK legit?

330
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:37,834
Speaker 0: All right.

331
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:39,830
Speaker 0: Well, what about ye sex offender registry?

332
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,630
Speaker 0: Which has a wave a whole bunch of people on who probably shouldn't be on there whose lives are ruined?

333
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,555
Speaker 1: All right, let's go the other way.

334
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:47,009
Speaker 0: What about on your KKK list wasn't actually in the KKK?

335
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:48,396
Speaker 1: Well, I'm saying what it was.

336
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:51,893
Speaker 1: a bona fide verified one like this one is interesting cuz Ashley Madison It's not.

337
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:53,402
Speaker 0: how do you know it's bona fide right?

338
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:54,550
Speaker 0: This is just something on pirate bay.

339
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,738
Speaker 1: No So this one's interesting because it does.

340
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:07,170
Speaker 1: there's one way to verify information like this and that is when there are many many Unstructured sources of data that all have to line up with each other.

341
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the one thing that's super hard to hack and cheat.

342
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:21,489
Speaker 1: Like if you break into a Linux system It's actually real hard to like mess with stuff without leaving a trail Man, they might not be able to trace you back to like, you know, that person did the hack.

343
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:30,210
Speaker 1: But people look at the data and say oh that data was fucked with Because var log messages has a gap and this other log file show, you know that kind of stuff.

344
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:40,210
Speaker 1: So here it's not just it's the profiles It's all the photos you posted of yourself all your communications your credit card number and all the transactions.

345
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:42,589
Speaker 1: It's pretty hard.

346
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:48,570
Speaker 1: Like you can pretty much prove for some of these accounts that it's bona fide like that person really did it.

347
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:56,895
Speaker 1: Hmm, but the other side what if an anti-abortion activist decided to hack Planned Parenthood and just released the database Everyone ever got an abortion.

348
00:21:56,915 --> 00:22:01,050
Speaker 1: Mmm, that would be super bad and hurt a lot of people.

349
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:03,190
Speaker 0: I think in the first two examples, right?

350
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,278
Speaker 0: Those are databases all the fur.

351
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,589
Speaker 0: the KA one is database of bad people.

352
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,050
Speaker 0: here Right is a database of bad people right?

353
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,026
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you want people like to talk about victim blaming right which is a real thing.

354
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:22,040
Speaker 0: where it's like Oh, well, you know you got murdered but it was your fault for walking into murder town Which is perfectly illegal and okay thing to do.

355
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,470
Speaker 0: and it's like well, you know what there's good tacos in murder town, right?

356
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:26,658
Speaker 0: Walking into murder town.

357
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,904
Speaker 0: you didn't do anything wrong.

358
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:30,076
Speaker 0: walking into murder town So it wasn't there was.

359
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,510
Speaker 0: no, you know justice there's like you just got murdered.

360
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,710
Speaker 1: It's not as you're going with this, but it is just wrong to be in the KKK, right?

361
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:44,630
Speaker 0: If you're in the KKK, I mean, so you're complaining that you got you know Messed up after you were doing something you weren't supposed to do.

362
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,122
Speaker 0: It's like if a kid, you know falls over and hurts his leg on the front porch.

363
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:51,995
Speaker 0: It's like oh my god It sucks, let me kiss it.

364
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:52,576
Speaker 0: make it better.

365
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:57,870
Speaker 0: if a kid falls off the fence and he was trying to climb into the neighbor's yard.

366
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,998
Speaker 0: It's a little different situation.

367
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:02,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, right with that victim blaming right?

368
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:03,190
Speaker 0: It's like in both cases.

369
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:11,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay The kid is the victim he fell down and hurt himself But in one case is he hurt himself in the act of doing something no good,

370
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:11,950
Speaker 1: but then the question is

371
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:19,201
Speaker 0: That's different than just the straight-up victim blaming of someone fell over and hurt themselves Blaming them for

372
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:19,930
Speaker 1: going deeper.

373
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:25,487
Speaker 1: What if his no-good was going into the neighbor's yard to steal bread just to feed his starving family?

374
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:28,548
Speaker 1: or you know The KKK guys think that they're doing good.

375
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:32,060
Speaker 0: Sure, so I do anything illegal unless they're lynching people.

376
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, or even if they are and they're just burning crosses, which is legal I guess even if they are lynching people they not on someone else's lawn.

377
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,810
Speaker 1: They think that's a good thing.

378
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,290
Speaker 1: So, well, you know morals are pretty relative and arbitrary.

379
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:48,410
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't agree that that's a good thing.

380
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,005
Speaker 0: So in the war of fighting against them if we win a battle, that's good in for me.

381
00:23:53,226 --> 00:24:03,149
Speaker 0: Yep, and that is why philosophically, I'm confide a complex opinion and Whatever I believe in if we strike a blow against the enemy I say it's good.

382
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:05,699
Speaker 0: Yep, same as humans have done for a long time.

383
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:21,185
Speaker 0: only I'm willing to admit it and I don't have to have some sort of Consistent rule that applies to all situations like no, right if we beat the bad guys this way I don't need to apply the same principle to fuck the good guys Just because you know, I don't need to have this consistent principle.

384
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:24,446
Speaker 0: It's fuck the guys I don't like and yay for the people I do like.

385
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,570
Speaker 0: yeah That's how I don't have to be in the world.

386
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,317
Speaker 0: We'll always be trying to be like have this like.

387
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,370
Speaker 0: they need to have consistency and apply the same rules all the time.

388
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,780
Speaker 0: No fight the bad guys and go for the good guys.

389
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:37,193
Speaker 0: and who gives a shit if you apply the same here saying we should become terrorists.

390
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:41,185
Speaker 0: No, just fight for what you believe and you know, who cares about?

391
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,550
Speaker 0: you know, it's like it.

392
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it okay to probably like, you know blow up, you know, North Korea?

393
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:47,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, it probably is.

394
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,218
Speaker 0: Is it okay to blow up the UK?

395
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:52,522
Speaker 0: No, we don't need to make some rule that Blowing up things is always okay or always not.

396
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:53,346
Speaker 0: Okay, who?

397
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:54,109
Speaker 0: we don't need that.

398
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:54,975
Speaker 0: It's okay.

399
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,485
Speaker 0: If you do it to bad guys, it's not okay.

400
00:24:56,505 --> 00:25:00,950
Speaker 1: if you do it to good guys Yeah, and of course bad guys include just random people in the desert happen to live in a town.

401
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:03,870
Speaker 0: No, I'm not saying that those people are right.

402
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,070
Speaker 0: In fact, I don't think anyone who's blown up anyone has been right in a very very very very very long time.

403
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,275
Speaker 1: Where it's also the separate question of I didn't do this hack But the data is there.

404
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:18,010
Speaker 1: What are the ethics of using that data if it's already there?

405
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:20,720
Speaker 1: That's the old, you know, there's a Star Trek about.

406
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,070
Speaker 1: they find a Nazi doctor's hologram.

407
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:25,889
Speaker 1: They bring him back and he has the cure to a horrible disease.

408
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,002
Speaker 1: But he got that cure by genociding tons of planets and killing trillions.

409
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:32,730
Speaker 1: Do you use the cure or not?

410
00:25:34,111 --> 00:25:35,175
Speaker 0: The cure actually gonna work.

411
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:36,199
Speaker 1: Uh, yes.

412
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,063
Speaker 0: Yeah that use it.

413
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,810
Speaker 0: Otherwise those people died in even more vain.

414
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:42,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the question of do you use the Nazi doctors evil for good?

415
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:46,460
Speaker 1: But the argument against it is that by you can't undo the evil.

416
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:50,937
Speaker 1: by using it you encourage people to do more evil because they Know that the fruits of their evil.

417
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,143
Speaker 1: I don't use by good people.

418
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:59,790
Speaker 0: No, fuck that Just because you're saying just as I use that Those people who decide to do more evil because I did some good can go fuck themselves.

419
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,117
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that is an argument.

420
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:16,430
Speaker 1: my whole point of this is that the Ashley Madison hack is a very complex issue that is not easy to argue about because even Poking it just glancing at it already opens like 20 different arguments.

421
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,886
Speaker 1: So if you have a discussion with a friend and they don't see how complex an issue this is.

422
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,170
Speaker 1: They're probably not that bright.

423
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,149
Speaker 1: That's the only point I got there.

424
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,470
Speaker 0: You got to split it up into the separate points and address each one individually without you know.

425
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:39,750
Speaker 0: You can't like suddenly start talking about you know Is an affair, you know, it's having an affair even bad it while you're still talking about like, you know, just you know privacy.

426
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:44,350
Speaker 0: It's like no you have to discuss privacy and then you had to discuss and they're completely separate.

427
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:44,932
Speaker 1: that is the.

428
00:26:45,012 --> 00:26:50,912
Speaker 1: that is actually one of my easiest signs of a person who is incapable of argument or knows their position as Bullshit.

429
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:59,750
Speaker 1: when they take an issue like this and as soon as you make some headway against them on whatever it is They're arguing they shift to one of those other topics to make sure that you can dislike whack-a-mole.

430
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,951
Speaker 1: You can never actually finish them on anything because they'll always move a little bit to the left a little bit to the right Right.

431
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:05,333
Speaker 0: It's like no.

432
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:13,790
Speaker 0: those are all completely separate arguments and each one has you know Multiple different answers or perhaps no answer or a really easy definitive answer.

433
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:25,143
Speaker 1: Anyway things of the day My thing of the day.

434
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:41,240
Speaker 1: I'm using this only because this like I Scott doesn't like talk about politics and I follow politics like sports And they're not as highly paid in many ways as some sports professionals, but anyway I'm using this as my thing of the day because it's so beautiful.

435
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,147
Speaker 1: I don't even like.

436
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,074
Speaker 1: I cannot even you can only odd.

437
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:52,656
Speaker 1: I can only so Right now in North Carolina, which is far from the worst state in the United States.

438
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:53,077
Speaker 0: Yeah.

439
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:53,318
Speaker 0: Okay.

440
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll say that Yeah, like it's in it's in the top half.

441
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:56,900
Speaker 0: It's not great.

442
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,062
Speaker 0: It has issues but has serious issues in fact, but it's not the worst, you know I

443
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:16,656
Speaker 1: said it was in the top half, but that could also mean the northern half anyway, so The top three polling candidates there in the in the just general election Like you just ask people like hey who should be president?

444
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:20,229
Speaker 1: Yeah 40% right now is Donald fucking Trump.

445
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:20,531
Speaker 1: Okay.

446
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:20,992
Speaker 1: All right.

447
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,360
Speaker 0: I remember only old people are answering these polls.

448
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,945
Speaker 0: So yeah, I don't mean anything.

449
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:29,740
Speaker 1: Hillary Clinton 38% but the margin of error is 3.2%.

450
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,149
Speaker 1: So it's a toss-up between the two of them.

451
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:32,979
Speaker 0: I think the margin of error is quite larger than that.

452
00:28:33,923 --> 00:28:38,221
Speaker 1: So number three with almost 10% sitting in at 9%.

453
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:40,613
Speaker 0: Nice third party usually gets about 10% in the US.

454
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:41,980
Speaker 1: is these nuts?

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,460
Speaker 1: Yeah These nuts these nuts is actually polling pretty consistently well across the country.

456
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:58,220
Speaker 1: And if you watch American media because overseas I've realized people see like our big political stuff But they don't see like the internals of our primaries.

457
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:10,759
Speaker 1: Uh Watch our news a little bit because every newscaster in the world now in America now talking about this stuff has to say these nuts Has to refer to a candidate these nuts and not laugh.

458
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:15,177
Speaker 0: He's be a 9% of the people of North Carolina voted for these nuts.

459
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:17,228
Speaker 1: these nuts I think I don't know.

460
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,736
Speaker 1: I think I'm more a fan of Demball's.

461
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:21,999
Speaker 0: Scott brought that I you know, I am a supporter of Demball's.

462
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,300
Speaker 0: But if everyone's already gonna get another these nuts trained we would only be splitting our voter base.

463
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,867
Speaker 0: Get to four and a half percent.

464
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,173
Speaker 0: that doesn't work in the US election.

465
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:34,208
Speaker 0: I like them balls, but you gotta Already got nine percent on these nuts.

466
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:35,211
Speaker 0: We'll stick with these nuts.

467
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:37,640
Speaker 0: You can't be around these nuts than dem nuts.

468
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,391
Speaker 0: Them two nuts are falling better.

469
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,540
Speaker 1: This photo is just so beautiful.

470
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:45,644
Speaker 1: So you got a thing.

471
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:46,629
Speaker 0: I do.

472
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:48,095
Speaker 0: so this guy is really smart.

473
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,220
Speaker 0: He made a time-lapse video.

474
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:52,331
Speaker 0: It's really short, but it's of a very interesting thing.

475
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:55,060
Speaker 0: It's of his sourdough starter.

476
00:29:55,361 --> 00:30:00,155

Speaker 0: Yes, it's the secret light.

479
00:30:03,324 --> 00:30:14,417
Speaker 0: You can basically just watch what this bread blob of flour and yeast and water does at night and It's not something you often see at this speed and it's just.

480
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:20,496
Speaker 0: you know There's so many things out there to time-lapse that people just haven't thought to time-lapse.

481
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:23,679
Speaker 0: and you know You can see a lot of interesting stuff like this.

482
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:30,400
Speaker 0: You know with high-speed cameras low-speed cameras, you know high magnification and also zooming way out.

483

Speaker 1: they are talking about eSports regular sports the overlap between the two games.

501
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:50,660
Speaker 1: sports are games.

502
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,824
Speaker 1: Not all games are sports.

503
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:55,937
Speaker 1: some games are but we're gonna say the brain isn't a muscle just because.

504
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,159
Speaker 1: otherwise anyway It's gonna be a real good lecture.

505
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:07,575
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm might even take a question or two at the end very end of packs Yeah, and then we're gonna run hopefully to the omega-thon finale or not make it.

506
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we'll live stream it.

507
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:13,460
Speaker 1: Who knows well to stay in the room because we're probably the last panel in there and just watch it on our phones.

508
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,010
Speaker 0: The enforcers are gonna want to take the room apart.

509
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:16,600
Speaker 1: Oh, they'll let us sit in there and watch it.

510
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,324
Speaker 1: I think we'll see.

511
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,275
Speaker 1: I mean we're enforcers just not at this packs.

512
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:20,000
Speaker 1: I'm sure they'll be cool.

513
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,503
Speaker 0: We'll see.

514
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:26,392
Speaker 1: the enforcers have never not been cool in my entire Run, we've been to every packs as geek night since 2008.

515
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:32,640
Speaker 1: They're not gonna not take apart the room Yeah, but they might let us sit in the room watching the omega-thon anyway.

516
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:39,232
Speaker 0: Anyway, the book club book is the eye of the world by Robert Jordan.

517
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:46,730
Speaker 1: I Think because it's getting toward nothing happening.

518
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,920
Speaker 0: No, you know what at the end they go to the eye of the world.

519
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:51,957
Speaker 1: Wow, all right boilers.

520
00:32:54,100 --> 00:33:00,401
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get the impression that this book is Just.

521
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:08,753
Speaker 1: it's just like the beginning of a whole bunch of books that'll go at the same pace until the end and I worry I might actually have to read them all or read spoilers.

522
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:12,271
Speaker 0: I put the second book on my Kindle To check.

523
00:33:12,311 --> 00:33:14,702
Speaker 0: the first chapter picks right up.

524
00:33:15,404 --> 00:33:24,314
Speaker 0: it just picks right up and it's as if it's thought that you could have just put that first chapter as the Final chapter of the first book and it would have been like up.

525
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:30,377
Speaker 0: and then of course It would have been a weird conclusion because it's a starter and it sort of reintroduces the characters and things is.

526
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:38,787
Speaker 1: it's the first chapter Of a new book I might power through and read the rest of the Wheel of Time stuff just because won't be that long until Our Scott backers book comes out.

527
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:41,357
Speaker 0: Just just need some fantasy novel doesn't matter.

528
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:41,980
Speaker 0: Just anything.

529
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:51,160
Speaker 1: No, once there's a date for the next Prince of Nothing book I'm pretty much gonna reread all those books because I've kind of forgotten details and I kind of want to be ready for that.

530
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,655
Speaker 0: Anyway, you didn't forget how to break horses and men.

531
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:56,183
Speaker 0: Oh Remember how to break?

532
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:58,173
Speaker 1: or there was so long ago.

533
00:33:58,193 --> 00:33:59,438
Speaker 1: We're so far beyond him.

534
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:07,520
Speaker 1: So Yeah, guess we never did a show on cookies which I'm pretty sure we have Dutch search for one.

535
00:34:07,922 --> 00:34:09,654
Speaker 1: All right, our search fucking sucks.

536
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:13,335
Speaker 1: So Let me try I mean on the archive right now.

537
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,320
Speaker 1: I just had cookie.

538
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,389
Speaker 0: Try the actual admin search.

539
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:18,553
Speaker 1: I also searched there.

540
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:19,275
Speaker 1: Nothing came up.

541
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:19,938
Speaker 0: Nothing came up.

542
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:23,114
Speaker 0: Well people love them food shows and I love them cookies.

543
00:34:23,154 --> 00:34:24,059
Speaker 0: So cookie show it is.

544
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:31,820
Speaker 0: So cookies are pretty much separated into two carrot categories in this world the bought cookie and the baked cookie.

545
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:36,821
Speaker 1: There's some overlap though because like fresh direct I can get cookies that are baked cookies Like.

546
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:46,620
Speaker 0: they're the same as something I would make at home effectively if it was made in a commercial bakery Then it is obviously even el fudge and chips ahoy are baked, right?

547
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:56,255
Speaker 0: It was made in a commercial bakery No matter how good it is a bought cookie if it was made in an oven No larger than the oven most people have in their homes.

548
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:57,240
Speaker 0: That's your line.

549
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:04,553
Speaker 1: I don't step above that because the cookie the oven at Takahachi Bakery is Significantly larger than the oven in either of our homes.

550
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,200
Speaker 0: That sounds like a professional place.

551
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:08,659
Speaker 0: It is a professional place like a bought cookie to me.

552
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:12,412
Speaker 1: But they make the cookies from scratch there every day.

553
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:17,991
Speaker 1: and you know, they make chips ahoy from scratch But they made a with a large mass recipe.

554
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:26,217
Speaker 1: mass recipes to be able to produce so much So consistently tend to be suddenly different from like the master baker decides.

555
00:35:26,297 --> 00:35:28,580
Speaker 1: This is the kind of cookie I'm going to make today.

556
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:34,080
Speaker 0: I mean if you have a giant oven usually have a big mixer and a big tub of cookie dough.

557
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,983
Speaker 0: You're making a big.

558
00:35:35,023 --> 00:35:37,231
Speaker 1: don't make that many cookies every day though.

559
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:39,520
Speaker 0: Let me tell you those run out of cookies then.

560
00:35:39,962 --> 00:35:41,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, they run out of almost everything every day.

561
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:42,436
Speaker 1: No.

562
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,180
Speaker 0: Well, that's not good.

563
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,280
Speaker 0: You want to make some more cookies then so you don't run out until the very minute you close your store.

564
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what those cookies real dangerous.

565
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:52,820
Speaker 1: I've stopped buying them because I'll eat all four of them.

566
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:58,884
Speaker 0: But anyway, both bots and baked cookies can be quite delicious Right.

567
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,370
Speaker 0: They can also be quite nasty.

568
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:02,480
Speaker 0: Some people suck at baking and they bake a shitty cookie.

569
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, also a lot of people like basically stale preservative filled trans fat cookies in boxes and bags, right?

570
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:11,360
Speaker 0: Well, you know, those are the shitty baked cookies.

571
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,180
Speaker 0: But even some of the mass-produced cookies can still be yummy.

572
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:20,229
Speaker 0: You know you get a nice get a nice golden Oreo.

573
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:25,520
Speaker 1: I thought that I thought that I've decided Golden Oreos are a trap.

574
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,154
Speaker 1: I only like them because I'm like out of packs and rower.

575
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:33,412
Speaker 1: someone brought them and I'm desperately hungry and the cookie Brigade hasn't been buyers.

576
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,240
Speaker 0: a golden Oreo is so delicious.

577
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:37,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know Gordon golden Oreo when you have other things available.

578
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,930
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I usually don't eat a cookie, you know, just sugar all the time when I have other things available.

579
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:55,428
Speaker 0: All right, but a cookie is Like the first most easiest thing to bake because you don't need to use any yeasts You know, you can get the same you can do the same consistent thing every time you just.

580
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:59,470
Speaker 1: they are Incredibly consistent to make and also incredibly shelf stable.

581
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,229
Speaker 0: You just mix up a dough and you spoon the dough and blobs onto a sheet and make it hot.

582
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:09,867
Speaker 1: Now there are complicated cookies that that is not true for but those are the cookies grandma makes.

583
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:10,550
Speaker 1: don't worry about that.

584
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,535
Speaker 0: Grandma's cookies usually harness good.

585
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, depending on things depending on the grandma.

586
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:18,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, my grandma may go cookies.

587
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,300
Speaker 0: yeah, depends.

588
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:23,908
Speaker 1: so I Kind of have a problem with cookies.

589
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:26,878
Speaker 0: Cookies you eat all of them.

590
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:29,130
Speaker 1: So yes, I will get like fancy cookies.

591
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,862
Speaker 0: Maybe this is why you don't like the golden Oreos.

592
00:37:30,902 --> 00:37:32,935
Speaker 0: if I get a bag golden Oreo I'll eat like two and that's it.

593
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'll eat two again way later like days later.

594
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:43,730
Speaker 1: But I eat good cookies on such a constant basis Like I eat so many cookies that Emily is vaguely horrified at it.

595
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:51,678
Speaker 0: Yeah You'll buy a box of like cookies the big kind like eight or nine like huge Shortbread the kind that are like three inch diameter.

596
00:37:51,718 --> 00:37:55,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like half an inch thick and you'll eat all of them at once.

597
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, well now I will eat all of them over the span of about 48 hours.

598
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:03,609
Speaker 0: All right I don't see how that's really any different than like the Red Bulls you drinkin.

599
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:04,940
Speaker 1: You know what.

600
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:08,698
Speaker 1: there are So many more calories in those cookies.

601
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:12,530
Speaker 1: Red Bull actually is not that like Red Bulls way less than soda.

602
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,279
Speaker 0: You're really just filling yourself up with sugar.

603
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,230
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter which vehicle the sugar is.

604
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,790
Speaker 1: I'm also filling myself up with fat and shortening.

605
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:22,970
Speaker 0: I mean, it's it's the sugar truck the sugar boat the sugar plane the sugar cargo plane.

606
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,610
Speaker 1: When you need a lot of honey and you're in I go sugar sugar sugar from your head to your toe.

607
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:29,059
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter how the sugar gets in there.

608
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,749
Speaker 0: It's getting in but cookie is a great way to go.

609
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:37,717
Speaker 1: So yeah, there was a famous incident where so I would buy these cookies and I'd be like, oh Emily I bought us some cookies and there's.

610
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:38,642
Speaker 1: then I put him in the fridge.

611
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,870
Speaker 0: You mean about you some cookies?

612
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I bought us some cookies and by the time Emily gets home.

613
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:44,830
Speaker 1: I've already eaten three of them.

614
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,610
Speaker 1: So there's only like four left and then I eat one more and I'm like, oh Emily you want one?

615
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,907
Speaker 1: So she eats one and I eat one and then I eat another one.

616
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:52,470
Speaker 1: cuz I'm hungry.

617
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:53,930
Speaker 0: That's the last cookie.

618
00:38:54,151 --> 00:39:00,030
Speaker 1: So one day it's gotten to the point to where I tried buying two things of cookies and they just eat more.

619
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:03,326
Speaker 1: They disappeared at the same in the same time period.

620
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,210
Speaker 1: we'll put it that way.

621
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:14,082
Speaker 0: Well, maybe this is why you should keep buying the you know Not mass manufactured cookie because even if there are some delicious ones like golden Oreo I worry that I would eat an entire the entire bag.

622
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,049
Speaker 0: That's way too much sugar.

623
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:25,150
Speaker 0: and Even you know baked cookies while they still have a load of sugar Usually have less and are usually have more say flour.

624
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:32,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, well also, you know what cookies the most the kind of like crapo cookies the most people eat like generic cookies.

625
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:41,389
Speaker 1: They're good But the reason the like special cookies are better tasting is that they usually have a lot more butter sugar stuff in them.

626
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:45,364
Speaker 1: So they're actually way more calories than you realize.

627
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:46,007
Speaker 0: That's true.

628
00:39:46,027 --> 00:39:46,689
Speaker 1: There's way more.

629
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,878
Speaker 0: You're usually will be more butter.

630
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:49,841
Speaker 0: All right, where's that?

631
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:50,524
Speaker 0: a chips?

632
00:39:50,544 --> 00:39:52,090
Speaker 0: Ahoy that doesn't have real butter in it.

633
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:55,589
Speaker 1: Like our friend Judith with you know the bait like the her blog on baked goods.

634
00:39:56,092 --> 00:40:00,770
Speaker 1: The secret to making most things taste better than store-bought is just to put four times more butter in right.

635
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,515
Speaker 0: I mean it chips.

636
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:03,470
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm telling you doesn't really have butter.

637
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,047
Speaker 0: It probably uses shortening or some other sorts of vegetable oils or like.

638
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:09,330
Speaker 0: so, you know Who knows what kind of oils they're using right?

639
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,790
Speaker 0: Because that has to be stable on the shelf you put butter in a bag on the shelf in the grocery store.

640
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:16,657
Speaker 0: Right, I mean bake some cookies.

641
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:17,641
Speaker 0: How long do they last?

642
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:19,168
Speaker 0: like a couple days and then they're hard.

643
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:21,818
Speaker 0: Yep You know and then it's not a good situation.

644
00:40:21,938 --> 00:40:23,444
Speaker 1: but even then cookies are good.

645
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,030
Speaker 1: like they're relatively shelf stable.

646
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:26,629
Speaker 1: They keep like some kinds of cookies.

647
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:29,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just they'll just get hard but doesn't mean they're not good anymore.

648
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,993
Speaker 0: other things get hard And then you can't eat them like a muffin ones a muffins hard It's done.

649
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,290
Speaker 1: but meanwhile like but a hard cookie is like still good.

650
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,068
Speaker 1: But like if you bake a cookie like Scott McElmett cookies cut off you have a little as much.

651
00:40:39,108 --> 00:40:40,793
Speaker 0: recently It's too hot.

652
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:44,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like they get hard, but they're still really good.

653
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:50,970
Speaker 1: But like Oreos if they're out too long Once they break the seal and they're open they get stale.

654
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,539
Speaker 0: Well, they either have preservatives and they don't.

655
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:56,850
Speaker 1: yeah, but stale I can eat a hard cook.

656
00:40:56,971 --> 00:41:01,076
Speaker 0: That's why they keep putting them in bags these days that reseal Yeah, and then they stay fresh.

657
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:05,010
Speaker 0: really a lot of people don't oh, you know, they'll open the bag wrong or something.

658
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,261
Speaker 0: It's like oh you just ruin that fuck that.

659
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:07,210
Speaker 1: That's that's that's one of the.

660
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:10,863
Speaker 1: There's very few things that I will judge someone on real hard about.

661
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:17,903
Speaker 1: like if someone just openly racist in front of me Like there's a permanent mark on their like record in my brain like alright.

662
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:20,670
Speaker 1: or like if someone's smoking cigarettes and hasn't quit.

663
00:41:21,993 --> 00:41:25,595
Speaker 1: If you don't reseal cookies That's that's a mark.

664
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:31,989
Speaker 0: if you're at a party and someone opens up a bag and leaves it open on that tip I'm like, you know the snack table that's not making it till the morning.

665
00:41:32,612 --> 00:41:40,429
Speaker 0: But if you reseal it and at home you buy a bag of cookies and keep take to put them back take to put them back That'll be good for days long time.

666
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:55,998
Speaker 1: So I experienced something kind of recently because I Started occasionally sampling marijuana against put it that way and that really hadn't really been a thing since a few times in college and Just so happened last time.

667
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:59,170
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of cookies around and you know my problem with cookies already.

668
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,413
Speaker 0: Did you eat too many cookies?

669
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,840
Speaker 0: So I'm sure they wouldn't.

670
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,264
Speaker 0: they taste bad the cookies.

671
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:05,407
Speaker 1: No, they just so.

672
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:06,290
Speaker 1: no they taste the same.

673
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:08,564
Speaker 1: So they were not marijuana cookies.

674
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:12,557
Speaker 1: There were regular cookies A lot of marijuana.

675
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:16,836
Speaker 1: Okay, and it's I'll put it this way This is gonna make me sound a real old.

676
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:23,650
Speaker 1: when we were at our IT and I would occasionally have marijuana That was way weaker than what marijuana is like nowadays.

677
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:29,609
Speaker 1: well I'm sure you can still get the weak stuff if you probably can but like the way people consume it and just that there's.

678
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,339
Speaker 1: So I had more than I was accustomed to.

679
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,350
Speaker 1: and I'm sitting there and we're playing Mario Kart and whatever and everything's fine.

680
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:44,170
Speaker 1: and I think to myself I would like a cookie and I walk over to where the cookies are and I can only tell you that this was exactly like Cookie Monster.

681
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:48,080
Speaker 1: Think about how bad I am with the cookies now coupled with the munchies.

682
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,550
Speaker 1: I basically ate like an entire thing of Oreos.

683
00:42:52,095 --> 00:42:52,823
Speaker 0: That's what you do.

684
00:42:52,843 --> 00:42:57,919
Speaker 0: Yep All right, just oh no, no And this is why I don't smoke weed.

685
00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:01,570
Speaker 0: you get stoner stories like this like oh my god I ate a bunch of cookies.

686
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:09,930
Speaker 1: Okay But it was such an order of magnitude more cookies than I eat with my already Not smoking marijuana cookie.

687
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,645
Speaker 0: That's stoner brain.

688
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,100
Speaker 0: Imagining the magnitude of the cookies like you're probably in your mind.

689
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,236
Speaker 0: There was like an avalanche of cookie like the frickin Those.

690
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:24,188
Speaker 0: what's that frickin cereal that tastes?

691
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:27,303
Speaker 0: Oh Cookie crisp cereal like the good.

692
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:28,930
Speaker 0: right the disgusting shit, right?

693
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,341
Speaker 0: And you're probably imagining like you were in a cookie crisp commercial or whatever.

694
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:33,324
Speaker 0: in reality.

695
00:43:33,746 --> 00:43:36,961
Speaker 1: You ate a whole bunch of cookies Yeah, but it was like 20 or 30 of these Oreos.

696
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:43,565
Speaker 0: I mean I can eat 20 or 30 or If I don't eat anything else, I won't say to a whole full bag of Twizzlers.

697
00:43:44,147 --> 00:43:45,250
Speaker 0: It's not really that different.

698
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:47,248
Speaker 0: Well, I can eat a giant pixie stick.

699
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:51,505
Speaker 1: The idea used to have those pixie six star it cuz we could buy them at the corner store.

700
00:43:51,525 --> 00:43:52,067
Speaker 0: That's right.

701
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:55,915
Speaker 1: Yeah but Yeah, those cookie cereals.

702
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:56,958
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna those aren't cookies.

703
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,363
Speaker 1: No, it's just disgusting.

704
00:43:58,523 --> 00:43:58,684
Speaker 1: Yeah.

705
00:43:59,065 --> 00:44:00,630
Speaker 0: All right, so let's talk about cookie variety.

706
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:07,389
Speaker 0: I Can't make a top three because basically without you don't have to order them.

707
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:21,590
Speaker 0: See what really these days people are mixing together so many different cookie ingredients Right to make all sorts of you know delicious combinations So that it's like you can't pick one single favorite cookie because it's like, you know, there's so many possible variations.

708
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:24,080
Speaker 1: Well, you go by your class of cookie then right?

709
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,370
Speaker 0: Well, I think the number one thing is I like a cookie.

710
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:31,330
Speaker 0: There are factors of cookie and if you combine these factors you will achieve perfect cookiness, right?

711
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:35,862
Speaker 0: So the first factor is heat right and chewiness.

712
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:37,125
Speaker 0: I like the chewy cookie.

713
00:44:37,165 --> 00:44:38,650
Speaker 0: I don't like the crisp hard cookie.

714
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:40,490
Speaker 1: I like both in different circumstances.

715
00:44:43,532 --> 00:44:52,150
Speaker 1: People say they like chewy cookie but like the average of person in Peoria the kind of cookie they want is that mrs Fields like it's just warmed up cookie dough, right?

716
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,735
Speaker 0: So the heat that's it.

717
00:44:53,816 --> 00:45:01,710
Speaker 0: the chewiness can't come from fake chewiness like a chewy Chips Ahoy Although those are good, but you know, that's not the right kind of chewiness, right?

718
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:06,890
Speaker 0: It has to come from the heat of having just been baked and cooled off enough.

719
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,074
Speaker 0: You can't get it straight out of the oven.

720
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:18,175
Speaker 0: You'll burn yourself right cooled off enough so that it's ready and cool to be eaten But still chewy because active molecules from just being baked That is the right.

721
00:45:18,276 --> 00:45:21,749
Speaker 0: if the chewiness comes from any other source is not the right kind of.

722
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,962
Speaker 1: yeah You want a little too, but that's the yes the walk.

723
00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:25,210
Speaker 0: Hey, right.

724
00:45:26,712 --> 00:45:29,570
Speaker 0: So then, you know in the doughy part, right?

725
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:36,290
Speaker 0: It's all about the sugars being as tasting as close to caramel slash butterscotch as possible.

726
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:51,350
Speaker 0: All right, when you make a cookie really you're just taking butter sugar flour You know egg possibly and just trying to get caramel into some sort of bread like shape and texture Right, but really you just want it to taste like fucking caramel.

727
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:55,301
Speaker 0: So the closer it tastes to that the better the cookie part is.

728
00:45:55,722 --> 00:46:01,950
Speaker 1: so I guess on that note in terms of that flavor I like really complicated weird cookies like fancy ones.

729
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:09,243
Speaker 1: But like I had I'm not gonna lie my favorite kinds of cookies aren't sugar cookies Bread cooking cookie and cookie.

730
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:11,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's the chocolate chip cookie.

731
00:46:11,207 --> 00:46:12,950
Speaker 1: That is a fundamentally different class of cookie.

732
00:46:13,431 --> 00:46:15,639
Speaker 1: Sure, whatever like they serve a different purpose.

733
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:18,670
Speaker 1: They feel different and they serve a different craving.

734
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:22,216
Speaker 0: And then in terms of the filling in the cookie, right?

735
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:29,443
Speaker 0: The best filling you can possibly put in a cookie is Pretty much fruits nuts and chocolates of any kind.

736
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:31,470
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter, but you're a medium.

737
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,256
Speaker 1: I like just the sugar cookie.

738
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:39,501
Speaker 0: the best fruits you can put in are dried fruits like say a Raisin or a craisin, right?

739
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:40,990
Speaker 1: What about the fancy grandma cookie?

740
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,187
Speaker 1: There's like shortbread on the outside and then like that apricot stuff you get in a hamantashen.

741
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:47,735
Speaker 0: on the inside That's like a fruit filling.

742
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:48,277
Speaker 0: That's not needed.

743
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:50,364
Speaker 0: So you're venturing slightly out of cookie.

744
00:46:50,385 --> 00:46:51,288
Speaker 0: That is a cookie.

745
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:53,500
Speaker 1: Sure I'm gonna go the Wikipedia page on cookie.

746
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:54,829
Speaker 0: It's a hamantashen by the way.

747
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:59,309
Speaker 1: anyway, the I pronounced it with my Midwestern media for the.

748
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:03,730
Speaker 0: For the nuts, right the absolute best nut is the walnut.

749
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:07,507
Speaker 0: There's pretty much no better not to put in a sweet cookie treat.

750
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:08,090
Speaker 1: that is true.

751
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:12,883
Speaker 1: That's why de Bella's has chocolate chip cookies and chocolate chip cookies with walnuts.

752
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:15,270
Speaker 1: The latter are just superior.

753
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,849
Speaker 0: Well, that's a real expensive for a reason.

754
00:47:18,893 --> 00:47:23,459
Speaker 0: And of course chocolate you want to put in Not the sweet chocolate.

755
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:31,888
Speaker 0: the sweetness is coming from the cookie You want to put in to contrast the flavor the dark chocolate or the semi-sweet or the bitter chocolate.

756
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,576
Speaker 0: and you don't want to Put in too much either.

757
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:35,890
Speaker 0: you want to put in so this is enough in each bite.

758
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:37,499
Speaker 0: So you get a little chocolate in each bite.

759
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,390
Speaker 0: You don't get like a face full of nothing but cookie.

760
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:43,790
Speaker 0: But you don't want to just be eating a chocolate bar with extra sugar added either.

761
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,538
Speaker 0: All right, it's got to be the right amount in there.

762
00:47:45,658 --> 00:47:48,130
Speaker 1: All right, the Wikipedia is pretty much like spot-on.

763
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:48,852
Speaker 1: It's very clear.

764
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:56,935
Speaker 1: Like this is United States centric a sweet baked treat flour eggs sugar butter cooking oil Or another fat of some kind.

765
00:47:56,955 --> 00:48:00,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, and maybe with something like raisins oats chocolate chips or nuts.

766
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:00,526
Speaker 0: Yep.

767
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:01,088
Speaker 1: That's it.

768
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:04,130
Speaker 1: That's cookie Yeah, or biscuit if you live somewhere weird.

769
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,797
Speaker 0: Now there are certain very popular cookies.

770
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:08,423
Speaker 0: I would like to comment on right?

771
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:10,270
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a list of all known names.

772
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:19,770
Speaker 1: There's a Wikipedia page list of all cookies, but then on the cookie page there is a list of notable cookie variety, right?

773
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,478
Speaker 0: So here's some notable cookie varieties.

774
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 1: Whoa, what's a fatigue man?

775
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:23,949
Speaker 1: I don't know.

776
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,838
Speaker 1: Oh, I know that kind of cookie.

777
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,423
Speaker 1: that's a doughnut though, it's not a cookie.

778
00:48:28,443 --> 00:48:30,850
Speaker 0: All right, so notable important cookies to discuss.

779
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:35,244
Speaker 0: Number one the Girl Scout cookie, you know what?

780
00:48:35,364 --> 00:48:35,826
Speaker 1: overrated?

781
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:36,770
Speaker 1: I don't like him anymore.

782
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:42,046
Speaker 0: Most people seem to like the really fancy ones that are complicated like the tag along right?

783
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:48,310
Speaker 0: I Prefer the thin mint but even more I prefer the one that no one gives a shit about which is the trefoil.

784
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, the shortbread one.

785
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:49,756
Speaker 1: That's the best girl.

786
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:52,790
Speaker 0: The trefoil is just the shape of a Girl Scout logo and it's a cookie.

787
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:54,094
Speaker 1: It's a shortbread cookie, right?

788
00:48:54,215 --> 00:49:00,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's just really freaking good and no one gives it any respect cuz it's so boring compared to Like the do-si-do or whatever.

789
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,342
Speaker 0: So you can get them real easily, but they taste great.

790
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:07,468
Speaker 0: I don't know and I you know the complicated ones I think just trying too hard.

791
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:13,228
Speaker 0: But the problem is I used to really like girls and the thin mint, you know The the chocolate quality in the thin mint.

792
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:24,030
Speaker 0: either I've been able to taste better chocolate or it's gotten worse because the chocolate and the thin mint is like the lowest Quality chocolate that there is I'd say and the mint is not nearly as strong as it used to be with the trefoil.

793
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:28,770
Speaker 1: Once I started eating fresh baked shortbread cookies, those things are just garbage.

794
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:34,923
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's just it's not a good version of that, but I'm comparing girls cookies to other girl But I'm saying comparing them to real cookies.

795
00:49:35,044 --> 00:49:38,930
Speaker 0: and with the thin yeah I mean a girl's got cookies a mass manufactured not great cookie.

796
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:39,894
Speaker 0: No matter which one you get.

797
00:49:39,954 --> 00:49:43,447
Speaker 1: the thin mint is in the same tier as the Andes mint.

798
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,833
Speaker 1: cheap chocolate Barely any.

799
00:49:45,034 --> 00:49:46,179
Speaker 0: and you would be surprised.

800
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:52,370
Speaker 0: the chocolate and mint in the Andes candies Which are not cookies, by the way, it's better than the chocolate and mint in a thin mint.

801
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:53,875
Speaker 1: I'd agree with that.

802
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:54,840
Speaker 1: thinking about it.

803
00:49:55,463 --> 00:49:56,186
Speaker 0: It's actually you know.

804
00:49:57,672 --> 00:50:02,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the girl scout cookie, okay So the Oreo Oreos been doing the thing lately, but they got tons of crazy flavors.

805
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,243
Speaker 0: That's their stick now and they have limp.

806
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:05,190
Speaker 0: They're all limited time.

807
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,383
Speaker 1: So, you know about the difference between Oreos and hydrox.

808
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:10,110
Speaker 0: Oh you want to talk about hydrox.

809
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:13,924
Speaker 1: Hydrox came first and in blind taste tests was better.

810
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:14,828
Speaker 0: I don't.

811
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:16,834
Speaker 0: I Have eaten both.

812
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:21,970
Speaker 0: I've never done a blind taste test, but the cookie part the frosting I can never tell the difference.

813
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:30,530
Speaker 0: But I could tell without even looking Eating the hydrox because the cookie is drier and the hydrox but has a more chocolatey flavor.

814
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:41,150
Speaker 0: That is true, but the dryness of the hydrox cookie You know Even though the chocolatey flavor of the hydrox cookie part is better because the Oreo cookie the chocolate one really doesn't taste like anything.

815
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:45,310
Speaker 0: It's really just a vehicle for the frosting except the golden Oreo, which tastes great.

816
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,082
Speaker 0: The dryness of the hydrox just may cancel it out.

817
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:50,444
Speaker 1: Yep.

818
00:50:50,745 --> 00:50:58,310
Speaker 1: I just I always remember as a kid There were a few people in the neighborhood who always got hydrox and everyone else got Oreos and I remember even make hydrox anyone.

819
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:06,430
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure that out right now but basically everyone always assumed that hydrox was like this bullshit knockoff and Like that was what the poor kids would eat.

820
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,573
Speaker 1: But now it was the opposite.

821
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:12,207
Speaker 1: the hydrox was like the high quality one and Oreo was the knockoff of hydrox.

822
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:14,818
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Let's see purchase.

823
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,542
Speaker 1: so formed in 1908.

824
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:15,944
Speaker 1: It's old.

825
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:22,695
Speaker 1: The company was bought by Keebler in 1996 mmm.

826
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:26,667
Speaker 1: and in 99 they replaced hydrox with a similar but reformulated thing named Roxy.

827
00:51:26,687 --> 00:51:27,470
Speaker 1: So hydrox is dead.

828
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:38,350
Speaker 1: Okay, as far as I can tell a bunch of carrot carvel Use the hydrox cookie crumbs until 2012 Because I guess they're kosher.

829
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:40,699
Speaker 1: Alright interesting.

830
00:51:40,861 --> 00:51:46,362
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Oreos got all these crazy flavors in the shtick and my co-workers sort of like.

831
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:52,689
Speaker 0: we're always get whatever those new flavors are and They usually do a pretty good job of tasting like what they say on the package.

832
00:51:53,530 --> 00:52:01,737
Speaker 0: But it's I think they keep them limited for a reason is that you'll realize like oh, there's really no point to this It's just you know more Oreo.

833
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:05,550
Speaker 1: They also don't taste that different like I wonder in blind tastes.

834
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:07,255
Speaker 0: I'll bet we just had.

835
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:17,090
Speaker 0: the one we had most recently was like brownie batter Oreo where the filling was replaced With something that tasted like brownie batter and it was pretty much just chocolate Oreo chocolate filling.

836
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,860
Speaker 0: it's like yeah, it had a very subtle difference.

837
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,405
Speaker 0: that was clearly brownie batter.

838
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:24,656
Speaker 0: ish, but What big deal?

839
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:25,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

840
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,063
Speaker 0: It's not like blowing you away.

841
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,127
Speaker 0: Like my life has changed.

842
00:52:28,207 --> 00:52:29,110
Speaker 0: I love these so much.

843
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:35,170
Speaker 0: You know, it's not something insanely good, you know, that's not you know, I'd rather eat just plain old golden Oreo.

844
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:40,439
Speaker 0: so Anyway, yeah And you know a lot of the weird flavors.

845
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,841
Speaker 0: like you don't even want to eat them at all like the watermelon one It's like oh, yeah, let's go to watermelon flaving.

846
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:46,027
Speaker 0: Okay, that's enough for that for me.

847
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:46,470
Speaker 0: I'm done.

848
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:47,112
Speaker 1: You know what?

849
00:52:47,133 --> 00:52:48,217
Speaker 1: It's like with cocktails.

850
00:52:48,438 --> 00:52:51,250
Speaker 1: I like the pure sort of classic cocktails with cookies.

851
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,514
Speaker 1: I like the pure classic cookies.

852
00:52:52,594 --> 00:52:54,539
Speaker 1: I like, you know, tall house style cookies.

853
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,144
Speaker 1: I like oatmeal cookies.

854
00:52:56,264 --> 00:52:58,210
Speaker 1: I like shortbread and sugar cookies.

855
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:09,442
Speaker 0: so the animal cracker is a cookie despite being called an animal cracker and It's usually Even though it's you know in the shape of an animal which is always fun.

856
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,437
Speaker 0: cuz like I'll bite off the giraffe's head And then his legs and I always get it on JetBlue.

857
00:53:14,497 --> 00:53:15,599
Speaker 0: cuz I don't want these little garbage.

858
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:24,227
Speaker 0: They're handing out Animal crackers regardless of who makes them seemed mostly just be like graham crackers in a different shape.

859
00:53:24,487 --> 00:53:27,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're very cinnamon-y and honey.

860
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:32,747
Speaker 1: We can't get into that because if we talk about graham crackers, you know, like, you know really like those.

861
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:35,435
Speaker 0: uh, Teddy Graham's That's usually what an animal cracker tastes like.

862
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:36,277
Speaker 1: Yeah.

863
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:36,859
Speaker 1: Yeah.

864
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, except Teddy Graham's always have like some weird coating to make them extra sweet.

865
00:53:40,611 --> 00:53:43,428
Speaker 0: Well, that's what animal cracker tastes like depends on the animal cracker.

866
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:48,990
Speaker 0: Sure Also, they remember when that is Teddy Graham's where they stuck to Teddy Graham's together with filling between them.

867
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:52,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like really really I remember I would own nowadays.

868
00:53:52,703 --> 00:53:57,823
Speaker 1: I only get animal crackers on airplanes Mmm, and I actually only get them if I did.

869
00:53:57,903 --> 00:53:59,070
Speaker 1: there isn't a better option.

870
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:12,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the graham cracker despite being really popular and coming in many different forms is really just sort of this bridge cookie in between The regular cookie and the gingersnap.

871
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:13,843
Speaker 0: right obviously a graham cracker.

872
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,450
Speaker 0: It doesn't have ginger and it has like cinnamon or whatever.

873
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:25,635
Speaker 0: But it's sort of like this area of cookie where he gets the spicy sweetness coming in because the cinnamon honey combo and Ginger snap is like.

874
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:26,981
Speaker 0: no, we're gonna make a spice cookie.

875
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:27,584
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

876
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:28,107
Speaker 0: Yeah.

877
00:54:28,207 --> 00:54:32,329
Speaker 0: Yeah I like me a gingersnap as long as it's still got some softness to it.

878
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:36,103
Speaker 0: Yeah Snaps get hard then it's like a spice cookie.

879
00:54:36,123 --> 00:54:37,689
Speaker 1: is all those things like we'd always make.

880
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:40,120
Speaker 1: you know The Christmas cookies with the shapes with spice.

881
00:54:40,421 --> 00:54:42,070
Speaker 0: Yeah gingerbread man that same deal.

882
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, the windmill cookie.

883
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:45,041
Speaker 1: That was my favorite mass-manufactured cookie.

884
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:46,306
Speaker 1: as a kid was the windmill cookie.

885
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:49,568
Speaker 1: Mmm Cuz those things had those thin sliced almonds in them.

886
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,055
Speaker 0: So there's chips ahoy.

887
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:54,860
Speaker 0: and what's the other brand?

888
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:55,964
Speaker 1: I can't eat that shit.

889
00:54:56,124 --> 00:54:56,947
Speaker 0: There's the other brand.

890
00:54:56,987 --> 00:54:57,267
Speaker 0: What is?

891
00:54:57,368 --> 00:55:02,169
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter I. Chocolate chip cookies in packages are just like I can't eat them.

892
00:55:02,771 --> 00:55:05,779
Speaker 1: They taste like preservative to me like they taste like they're.

893
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,590
Speaker 1: they're soft still and my brain says this should not be soft.

894
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:11,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just can't.

895
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:16,184
Speaker 0: there's like two major brands of you know, bagged cookie.

896
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:17,848
Speaker 0: that are right bad cookie.

897
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:24,470
Speaker 0: Yeah There's also, you know a bunch of other similar kind of things down there like the EL fudge.

898
00:55:24,892 --> 00:55:27,445
Speaker 0: It's like the two little Keebler elves with a ship in between them.

899
00:55:27,465 --> 00:55:33,190
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid I really liked those because there was no lady when we had block parties who would always set up a table.

900
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:37,130
Speaker 1: It's just tons and tons and tons of those things and I just stand there to fisting them.

901
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:43,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then I got a little older and my tongue probably revolt if I did that there's still a step up.

902
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are.

903
00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:56,650
Speaker 0: but then you go step up even further and now you're getting into Vienna finger territory Which Vienna finger is like a slightly differently shaped golden Oreo with little less sugar and a little more cake flavor.

904
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,734
Speaker 1: I feel like Vienna fingers.

905
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,024
Speaker 1: there was an era at RIT with the Vienna fingers.

906
00:56:00,064 --> 00:56:00,887
Speaker 0: Vienna fingers are good.

907
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:01,590
Speaker 1: They were okay.

908
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:02,675
Speaker 1: I don't know if they live up anymore.

909
00:56:02,816 --> 00:56:05,027
Speaker 0: No, this tastes Vienna finger flavor has never changed.

910
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:05,610
Speaker 0: as far as I can.

911
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:05,952
Speaker 1: I know.

912
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:08,027
Speaker 1: I'm saying my taste might have gone beyond them.

913
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:08,309
Speaker 0: Sure.

914
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:13,130
Speaker 0: So then after that you start getting into like the hard mode, right?

915
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:20,820
Speaker 0: the hard mode is like chess men that come in a bag or School boys using the Milano's right?

916
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,743
Speaker 1: I like the school boys.

917
00:56:21,783 --> 00:56:22,506
Speaker 1: the white chocolate.

918
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,570
Speaker 1: school boys are pretty right.

919
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:24,195
Speaker 0: These are.

920
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:32,217
Speaker 0: these are cookies are mass-manufactured But you only get a few at a time and they come in a little baggie or something and they're kind of fancy Except that they're not really fancy.

921
00:56:32,237 --> 00:56:32,980
Speaker 0: get them anywhere.

922
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

923
00:56:33,382 --> 00:56:34,165
Speaker 1: I'll eat them all.

924
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,390
Speaker 1: so that's the problem.

925
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:41,630
Speaker 0: And then the highest level of store-bought cookie the malamar which might not even be a fucking cookie depending.

926
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:43,537
Speaker 1: I'm not a big fan of Malamar's.

927
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:46,065
Speaker 0: Malamar's cost five bucks for a reason.

928
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,450
Speaker 1: I just don't like it that much.

929
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,984
Speaker 0: It's basically a s'more.

930
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:53,142
Speaker 0: That's not warm It's like a packaged up s'more.

931
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:55,094
Speaker 0: you get a s'more whenever you want No campfire.

932
00:56:55,214 --> 00:56:58,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that is why it's five bucks to get a box of Malamar's the wok.

933
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,034
Speaker 1: Hey, that can't be.

934
00:57:00,174 --> 00:57:09,150
Speaker 0: and it's more obviously a Malamar is not a replacement for a campfire s'more It is simply an alternative s'more variety.

935
00:57:09,331 --> 00:57:14,470
Speaker 0: Right much in the same way that Something I can't come up with an example for right now.

936
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:16,274
Speaker 0: So there you have it.

937
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:18,766
Speaker 0: Yep, if Malamar's are on sale you buy them.

938
00:57:18,846 --> 00:57:19,570
Speaker 0: if they're not you don't.

939
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:26,639
Speaker 1: One thing we can say though We're coming up on PAX and one of the things I really love about PAX is the cookie brigade because we were sitting there.

940
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:29,550
Speaker 0: they Brigade the finest the finest of cookies.

941
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:36,017
Speaker 1: You're like halfway through a game and everyone's pretty hungry just because you haven't gone out to eat yet And I'm gonna eat

942
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:37,829
Speaker 0: when this game's over, but it's only half over

943
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:44,250
Speaker 1: Yep, and then like you really want some food, but you can't stand up and suddenly someone behind you just says cookie Brigade

944
00:57:44,551 --> 00:57:44,992
Speaker 0: It's like

945
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:45,313
Speaker 1: oh

946
00:57:45,855 --> 00:57:48,423
Speaker 0: you have a delicious sugar that has been set on fire.

947
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:50,510
Speaker 0: I have a photograph of George, Washington.

948
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:53,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, shall we trade a lot of times?

949
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:54,716
Speaker 1: Here's ten bucks.

950
00:57:54,736 --> 00:57:56,044
Speaker 1: Just let me grab a fistful of cookies.

951
00:57:56,064 --> 00:57:56,990
Speaker 1: I'm gonna eat them all right now.

952
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,573
Speaker 0: Anyway, you could probably they better not let you have the whole bag He's not?

953
00:58:01,016 --> 00:58:02,929
Speaker 0: rim could eat the whole bag and then what would they do?

954
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,767
Speaker 0: That's why usually I think like they get up on the stage and it packs and by guys.

955
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:09,760
Speaker 0: this year Cookie Brigade only brought in like ten bucks.

956
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:13,456
Speaker 0: the ten bucks that rim gave us before I had all the cookies They like.

957
00:58:13,597 --> 00:58:14,603
Speaker 1: roll me out of the stage.

958
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:15,810
Speaker 1: I'm still eating the cookies.

959
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:19,390
Speaker 0: We all know we had gluten-free ones left over that he didn't eat, but no one wanted him.

960
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:21,079
Speaker 1: He's trying to eat him like now.

961
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:32,253
Speaker 0: There's only one person here who actually had 97 98 97.

962
00:58:32,253 --> 00:58:33,337
Speaker 1: You know the real situation.

963
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:38,701
Speaker 1: they come up and like we raised $800,000 this year Just one guy gave us all this cash.

964
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:40,189
Speaker 1: He's eating all the cookies in the back right now.

965
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,380
Speaker 0: The final game of facts is rim.

Speaker 0: guys don't understand.

970
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:56,330
Speaker 1: Not only do I like cookies, but I As soon as the show ends, I'm gonna run in cuz why I just got some cookies that are fresh.

971
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:58,116
Speaker 0: You ate one before the show.

972
00:58:58,136 --> 00:58:59,722
Speaker 1: I ate two daddy.

973
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I ate one right when I came home.

974
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,015
Speaker 1: Do you eat cookie?

975
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:03,739
Speaker 0: I had to.

976
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:04,784
Speaker 0: I picked.

977
00:59:04,824 --> 00:59:07,806
Speaker 1: I pulled out another one As I was walking over here.

978
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:09,313
Speaker 0: Okay.

979
00:59:09,515 --> 00:59:09,797
Speaker 0: Yeah.

980
00:59:09,817 --> 00:59:11,710
Speaker 0: Did you have you have a problem?

981
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,627
Speaker 1: except

982
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:24,831
Speaker 0: If I have cookies in my house usually I have to bring them to work to get them finished off because I don't control myself and eat a Ration of them per day if and some days I don't even any because it's it's too much I think

983
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:25,475
Speaker 1: the difference

984
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,258
Speaker 0: like at work today.

985
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:28,570
Speaker 0: There's a bag of Kit Kats, you know the mini ones.

986
00:59:29,193 --> 00:59:34,630
Speaker 0: So I ate like, you know - so that's it You know slightly less than a full normal person.

987
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:35,935
Speaker 1: I can only eat about two of those.

988
00:59:35,976 --> 00:59:39,370
Speaker 1: before I felt blarg and now I don't even eat a whole Snickers bar.

989
00:59:39,553 --> 00:59:44,104
Speaker 0: And now when I get home I'm not gonna be eating any cookie or any kind of chocolate or dessert whatsoever.

990
00:59:44,144 --> 00:59:49,042
Speaker 1: cuz I think the difference is just my Metabolism because I weigh the same that I've weighed for like 15 years.

991
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:49,604
Speaker 1: I weigh 155 pounds.

992
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:50,166
Speaker 1: It never deviates.

993
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:56,950
Speaker 0: I weigh about the same, you know different in the morning in the night, but you know, the range doesn't change.

994
00:59:57,473 --> 01:00:08,158
Speaker 1: I am pretty much always hungry and And When I eat to film to do actually being full like if I eat to the point that I'm not hungry anymore That just gets me to my baseline.

995
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:11,170
Speaker 1: So I think it's just cuz I exercise a lot.

996
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:28,370
Speaker 1: I mean if you if you need motivation to be an athletic person, the only motivation you should need should be this I Rim as can be attested to by most of the people we know eat all the cookies I want all the time and I'm totally okay, and I'm not fat.

997
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:31,010
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing is somebody is already fat.

998
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,330
Speaker 0: They have to go through a period of not only exercising and being hungry.

999
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:43,290
Speaker 0: I'm not eating all the cookies before they can reach the point where they have to continue the exercising But now can resume eating all the cookies.

1000
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:52,030
Speaker 1: So if you're not fat if you're skinny and you like to eat cookies But you only eat a few because of self-control exercise like I do and you can eat all the cookies you want.

1001
01:00:53,112 --> 01:01:01,970
Speaker 0: Or Just don't eat all those cookies because even though you may not get fat Still all that sugar is probably not the best thing for you to be doing.

1002
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:05,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, but last time I went to the doctor They were like, wow, your blood is perfect.

1003
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:06,178
Speaker 1: Like everything's great.

1004
01:01:06,218 --> 01:01:07,503
Speaker 1: Your cholesterol is like near the.

1005
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:11,158
Speaker 0: did you eat cookies right before going to the Doctor the minute before?

1006
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:13,490
Speaker 1: no because you have to fast so they can do the blood sugar thing.

1007
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,010
Speaker 0: That's why they didn't see your cookie problem.

1008
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:24,449
Speaker 0: if you would if they would have done that blood test the day before they would have pulled up and On the EKG the little line we're gonna do it and drawn a picture of a cookie and they'll be like up.

1009
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:27,664
Speaker 1: They go to draw blood and cookie dough just coming out.

1010
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:28,869
Speaker 0: me see problem here.

1011
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:32,156
Speaker 0: See is for cancer.

1012
01:01:32,698 --> 01:01:36,210
Speaker 1: I watched a lot of Sesame Street and I feel like that's why I'm the way I am today.

1013
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,334

Speaker 0: I got out the rainbow cookies at the Italian bakery.

1032
01:02:24,522 --> 01:02:26,730
Speaker 0: You can talk about cookies from all sorts of different countries.

1033
01:02:26,891 --> 01:02:34,910
Speaker 0: There's one bad kind of cookie that I actually really like, you know You came or they fucking call it a biscuit and a cookie something different the black-and-white cookie like and white cookies.

1034
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:40,470
Speaker 1: It's so much going on here, but the kind of cookie that's bad and I know it's bad, but I like it anyway.

1035
01:02:40,571 --> 01:02:45,939
Speaker 1: but it's how I try to avoid eating them are that like Store-bought kind of bakery cookie.

1036
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:52,643
Speaker 1: That is just a sugar cookie, but it's covered Completely in thick multicolored hard frosting.

1037
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:54,349
Speaker 0: I don't like the hard frosting no matter what it's on.

1038
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:58,320
Speaker 1: Somehow for some reason I really like that kind of cookie eating.

1039
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,709
Speaker 0: that is like eating the giant multicolored rainbow lollipop.

1040
01:03:01,749 --> 01:03:02,476
Speaker 0: No It's like.

1041
01:03:02,537 --> 01:03:03,490
Speaker 0: I feel that's not free.

1042
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:05,517
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like a thing that you eat.

1043
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:13,630
Speaker 1: it seems like a prop I know but yet when I eat that cookie Part of me is saying this is wonderful and part of me is just trying to look away.

1044
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:15,724
Speaker 0: No part of me even wants to eat that cookie.

1045
01:03:15,784 --> 01:03:16,670
Speaker 0: I can't even take one bite.

1046
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,398

Speaker 1: That's like, ah, no the heart.

1049
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:31,025
Speaker 0: Now if you take a regular cookie and you put some actually creamy frosting on the regular cookie now you have a cake But then you go one step further.

1050
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:39,330
Speaker 1: anyway Just take that cookie get another identical cookie put ice cream between the two cookies and now you have the full power.
