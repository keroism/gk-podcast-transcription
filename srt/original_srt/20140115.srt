Speaker 1: Okay.

29
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,501
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that.

30
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:49,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I we skipped a show earlier in the week.

31
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,934
Speaker 0: Sorry about that.

32
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:52,289
Speaker 0: I had a last-minute trip to Omaha, Nebraska.

33
00:01:53,239 --> 00:02:08,303
Speaker 0: ha never never been to Nebraska before and As far as my brain is concerned Nebraska exhibit Omaha specifically exists as a hotel and one Other building that sits through an airport door.

34
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:13,369
Speaker 0: because I flew out of Newark Airport The worst Airport in I don't know the East Coast of the United States.

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,850
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's the worst.

36
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,773
Speaker 1: It's not a good name.

37
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:16,354
Speaker 0: a worse one.

38
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:21,949
Speaker 0: a worse Airport because at least smaller shittier airports have better food and less of a security line.

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,849
Speaker 0: Newark has all the problems of a real Airport, but none of the amenities of a real Airport.

40
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,277
Speaker 0: There isn't even food.

41
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:31,442
Speaker 0: past security.

42
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,229
Speaker 0: you're fucked if you go through that line.

43
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:36,300
Speaker 0: All right, so I got.

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,759
Speaker 0: I basically went to Newark flew to Nebraska Slept in a hotel went to a four-hour long meeting.

45
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,122
Speaker 0: immediately flew home.

46
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:50,529
Speaker 0: less than 24 hours after I walked out of that plane I walked back into Newark Airport at the same gate.

47
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,258
Speaker 0: That was actually really surreal.

48
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,782
Speaker 0: I hope I never do that again in my life.

49
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,310
Speaker 0: I had Airport food at both sides.

50
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,569
Speaker 1: Okay Let me tell you airplane food.

51
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:04,603
Speaker 0: No, there was no plane food cuz it's like a two and a half hour flight.

52
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,266
Speaker 0: if that it's a really short flight Nebraska is not that far away.

53
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,513
Speaker 1: That's scary.

54
00:03:10,593 --> 00:03:12,560
Speaker 1: I want to be as far in for Nebraska as possible.

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,484
Speaker 0: This is not so bad.

56
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,129
Speaker 0: They they were not in move there.

57
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:16,627
Speaker 0: You know what?

58
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,913
Speaker 0: Nebraska.

59
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,282
Speaker 0: well, Omaha is a city.

60
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:23,656
Speaker 0: seats about Boston sighs Like that's the size of that city.

61
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:24,719
Speaker 0: There's stuff going on.

62
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,566
Speaker 0: There's actually a lot of IT and tech workers.

63
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:27,328
Speaker 1: Okay?

64
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,556
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, it's not a city I want to move to because I'd have to own a car.

65
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:35,410
Speaker 0: but if my parameters are have to own a car is a deal-breaker.

66
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:44,809
Speaker 0: Not only can I only really live in like parts of Seattle and New York But the parts are actually kind of small like if I go out into Queens or parts of Brooklyn need a car.

67
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,726
Speaker 1: You live in Flushing can't need a car.

68
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:49,502
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, that's that's why we didn't do a show.

69
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:57,210
Speaker 0: but I'm back from Nebraska And hopefully I won't go to Nebraska again anytime soon, but on the list of places that I don't like Nebraska way low.

70
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:58,233
Speaker 0: There's places.

71
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,999
Speaker 0: I dislike way less than Nebraska.

72
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:05,520
Speaker 0: So Nebraska not so bad, Afghanistan Lots of places in the United States.

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,389
Speaker 0: I would rather live in Omaha, Somalia.

74
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:10,361
Speaker 0: I'd rather live in Omaha than any city.

75
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:15,416
Speaker 0: That's part of the proper former Confederacy Detroit.

76
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:22,438
Speaker 0: I would I Would give it 50/50 between to Omaha and Detroit right now because Detroit's kind of gentrifying.

77
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,149
Speaker 0: there's stuff going on there suddenly Like very recently, but I digress.

78
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,596
Speaker 0: so got any anime news.

79
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:30,780
Speaker 0: it's Wednesday anime.

80
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:31,871
Speaker 1: It's really anime news.

81
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:32,780
Speaker 1: This is the best news.

82
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,269
Speaker 1: Well, this is the news worth talking about.

83
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,348
Speaker 1: that of the list of news is worth talking about This is the one most closely related to animes, right?

84
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,920
Speaker 1: So what this guy did is he had a booth at CES, right?

85
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:50,340
Speaker 1: The consumer electronic show which is in Vegas at the beginning of every year where they show off all the electronic goodies, right?

86
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:53,391
Speaker 1: And this isn't like a convention like PAX or anything.

87
00:04:53,411 --> 00:05:03,548
Speaker 1: this is a typical, you know trade show where it's pretty much like imagine take PAX just the expo hall and Only people in the video game business.

88
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,354
Speaker 1: no video game players, right?

89
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:08,298
Speaker 1: So it's like no one's there Who's like a person who watches TV?

90
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,202
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they are.

91
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:14,520
Speaker 1: but there are people who buy TVs sell TVs make TVs etc, right?

92
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:21,330
Speaker 1: And it covers all consumer electronics every category Cameras fucking everything right?

93
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:27,031
Speaker 1: I like you had one example like cameras Everything everything they sell at Best Buy pretty much.

94
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,556
Speaker 1: Hey Best Buy sells it.

95
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:29,339
Speaker 1: It's at this show.

96
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:37,100
Speaker 1: So, of course one of the controversies is all you know booth babes cuz they're there and there's a lot of them there.

97
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:40,519
Speaker 1: It's like place if you're booth, babe, that's you want to go to get a job.

98
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:48,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually last year there were a little bit less booth babes than usual But it's apparently because no one had any money and this year they had money again.

99
00:05:48,540 --> 00:06:00,480
Speaker 1: So everyone had him again and people were like grumble grumble and doing the usual same thing They do every time the booth babes story comes up, which is interviews and booth babes Interviews and people who hire booth babes, right?

100
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,417
Speaker 1: Etc talk about the creepy dudes who were there and talk about the.

101
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:10,880
Speaker 0: you know A lot of people like to complain about packs but packs actually bends booth babes and no one else is really following that right?

102
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,970
Speaker 1: But anyway, here's the real here's the interesting news story, right?

103
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:15,757
Speaker 1: Cuz it's not news so far so far.

104
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:16,720
Speaker 1: It's same old same old.

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,362
Speaker 1: Yeah, nothing.

106
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:26,780
Speaker 1: We're talking about one guy had a booth and He was anti booth babe guy, but his company pretty much just always paid for it and made it happen.

107
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:32,238
Speaker 1: Right and the people above him, you know, just you sort of believed that it worked so they always did it.

108
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,119
Speaker 1: now Somehow someone offered him some free space somewhere else.

109
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,000
Speaker 1: So he had two booths, huh?

110
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,700
Speaker 1: So he called up, you know the staffing people, right?

111
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaker 1: And for that second booth, he asked not for booth babes.

112
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:58,873
Speaker 1: He specifically said I don't want anyone who is you know hot I want people who have really good people skills Etc, etc, right because you still have to hire people to work the.

113
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:03,470
Speaker 0: I hope this is going toward the anecdote Proving the good point and not the cynical bad point.

114
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he got people.

115
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,420
Speaker 1: they sent him people to work that booth.

116
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,934
Speaker 1: One of them was literally a grandma.

117
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,040
Speaker 1: there was no pictures of them.

118
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:22,822
Speaker 1: I don't think it was a joke like GOG did right where they have grandma's acting as grandma's now It was just they sent him some people who were you know people people that weren't hot people Right.

119
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,065
Speaker 1: They were normal people.

120
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,850
Speaker 1: They weren't there for their bodies.

121
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:39,476
Speaker 1: They were there for their you know, human interaction skills, right and He a/b tested the booth babes in the one booth and the normal people with sales skills in the other booth and the booth at the booth babes.

122
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,333
Speaker 1: Alright, it got.

123
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,160
Speaker 1: you know They got contacts there.

124
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,257
Speaker 1: He measured based on how many like contacts they got and like leads they got because that's what you're there for.

125
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,040
Speaker 1: you're selling something.

126
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,991
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's biz dev people like to make.

127
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,600
Speaker 0: they make a really specific distinction.

128
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,104
Speaker 1: So they had a right.

129
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:58,420
Speaker 1: so they had computer systems where people would like enter in like their contacts and right and whatnot.

130
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:01,960
Speaker 1: So it was how many did we get at this booth and how many did we get at that booth?

131
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:20,360
Speaker 1: So first of all Not only did the non booth babe booth get like double or triple or even more the amount of you know Leads and contacts or whatever, but the ones they got at the booth babe booth Were really low quality shitty people that didn't really, you know, not good quality.

132
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:24,274
Speaker 1: The ones they got at the other booth were all real deal.

133
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:25,760
Speaker 1: We can make money off this shit.

134
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:33,880
Speaker 1: I can kind of speak at least his business which was you know The people above him were people who believed in booth babes or whatever and wanted to pay for them all the time.

135
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:38,979
Speaker 1: At least they were convinced by the data and I guess they're not getting them anymore in the future, right?

136
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,780
Speaker 1: Even though those same people believed in them not a few weeks.

137
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:56,210
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll say straight up when I go to do my trade conferences in the financial sector any booth and any one of these things that has a bunch of that bullshit on it is usually a Worthless contact to have from my side the guy walking around.

138
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:56,892
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

139
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,580
Speaker 0: So I actually avoid booze that have big stuff.

140
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:05,040
Speaker 0: I'll only go to booze that have big stuff that are also giving away expensive free things.

141
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 0: And I have a fake set of business cards that goes to basically forwards through to Gmail.

142
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:16,600
Speaker 0: So if I win something I can get it, but they will never trace it back to me and my real job in my real name.

143
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:23,220
Speaker 1: So yeah now we have definitive proof of what we suspected Which is that booth babes don't even help you.

144
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,980
Speaker 1: All they do is get sleazy guys to come to your booth and get their picture taken and they kind of scare smart people away.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,806
Speaker 0: Well, you know the traditional help your business.

146
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,733
Speaker 0: the traditional wisdom always shines through.

147
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:41,559
Speaker 0: the kinds of people you see patronizing strip clubs are the kinds of people you probably don't want to have a conversation with right and also the place it's.

148
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,680
Speaker 1: you know, It's also probably true the places that have booth babes are probably people where the product doesn't sell itself.

149
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:54,100
Speaker 1: It needs some kind of help right look at packs at the booths that tried and failed to have booth babes, right?

150
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,668
Speaker 1: There's like that energy drink booth.

151
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:56,513
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

152
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,660
Speaker 0: I forgot about that, right?

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:04,440
Speaker 1: Which they have hot people of all genders there, you know who are fully clothed, but they are not energy drink specialists.

154
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:18,013
Speaker 1: Shall we say yeah I would love to see the person the kind of person who is like the Red Bull Connoisseur and that Duke Nukem booth not the highest quality game you could say Needed some marketing help to get sales.

155
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:19,340
Speaker 0: Yeah those booth bae.

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,427
Speaker 0: Well, there were booth babes at that booth.

157
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:24,177
Speaker 1: there were but they for a limited time only.

158
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:33,898
Speaker 0: they yeah they also to their credit because I kind of got pulled into the back of the booth and got to talk to a lot of them had All memorized a lot of information about the game and all.

159
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:41,265
Speaker 1: yeah Sure, but they don't have the the sales skills, perhaps then maybe they do but you know The other people did.

160
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:44,638
Speaker 0: well packs is different because no one you're not it's not the same kind of.

161
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,540
Speaker 0: no I'm not know what valve software is not thinking.

162
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:57,207
Speaker 0: Well, we got a lead that don't rims gonna buy this game on steam if we email him later Like the games are.

163
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:59,778
Speaker 1: so valve developer conference is happening now.

164
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,952
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I almost wanted to go to that but I couldn't justify going.

165
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:04,840
Speaker 1: well, it's sort of it's like all secret and shit.

166
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,939
Speaker 1: I know it's like packs dev but one thing that is not secret about it Is that if you went in the goodie bag was a steam controller, which is not cheap.

167
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,249
Speaker 1: Those things are gonna be like a lot of money.

168
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:19,090
Speaker 0: I saw someone made a pretty apt tweet that's been making the rounds.

169
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:25,560
Speaker 0: that valve is Basically right now doing the equivalent of handing out muskets in the night to eventually overthrow the king.

170
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:30,060
Speaker 1: I was the one who saw that article and tweeted it and then you just copied what I saw and copied.

171
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've retweeted your tweet.

172
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:32,998
Speaker 0: That was from someone else.

173
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,225
Speaker 0: Okay.

174
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:35,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard.

175
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:38,759
Speaker 1: Oh So yeah, so this is related to anime.

176
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,630
Speaker 1: I got to bring this back to anime.

177
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,080
Speaker 0: Okay, bring it back babe story.

178
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:48,139
Speaker 1: There seems to be this assumption among the anime makers right that you know?

179
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:52,400
Speaker 1: I guess virtual boobies sell mangas and animes.

180
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:54,371
Speaker 1: Maybe they don't.

181
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:56,840
Speaker 0: I Suspected that for a while.

182
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,502
Speaker 0: I think they.

183
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,911
Speaker 0: it's the same situation with superhero comics in the US.

184
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:03,816
Speaker 1: Even these new shows that we say are saving anime All have boobies in them.

185
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,844
Speaker 1: maybe They don't.

186
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:12,651
Speaker 1: maybe maybe like the booth babes Like imagine if kill la kill didn't have all this nakedness.

187
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:16,909
Speaker 1: like you'd made the show about something beside you could still make it Just as good but instead of being about clothing.

188
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,100
Speaker 1: It could just be about hats only or something, right?

189
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could still be just as good.

190
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:25,769
Speaker 1: It's all the craziness and everything Would even more people watch it.

191
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,195
Speaker 0: Well, I'll put it this way.

192
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:28,140
Speaker 0: Well, there's that lol.

193
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,348
Speaker 0: Well, that was basically anime fans.

194
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:30,689
Speaker 0: Wow.

195
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,335
Speaker 0: Look at that deconstruction of clothing.

196
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,880
Speaker 0: blah blah blah non anime fans.

197
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,895
Speaker 0: Why isn't that girl wearing pants?

198
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:39,829
Speaker 1: That's right Exactly 100,000% correct.

199
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,191
Speaker 0: Yep.

200
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:42,240
Speaker 0: Every every anime fan has had that moment.

201
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:50,360
Speaker 0: we were watching some show on a subway or on a train and You kind of pause it and make the windows smaller and then start again.

202
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:53,234
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can't even scroll your Twitter.

203
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:56,507
Speaker 0: Yep Especially with some of the people I'm following lately.

204
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,519
Speaker 0: entice guys with your gay porn all over my Twitter.

205
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,052
Speaker 1: suddenly I don't know who you're following, but I'm not following that.

206
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,320
Speaker 0: I'm following a few people recently anyway.

207
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,010
Speaker 0: but That what I say when it comes to all this sort of like.

208
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,517
Speaker 0: I like a good exploitation film Whatever it might be for example black dynamite.

209
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:24,540
Speaker 0: But anytime there's media that is that has twinges of racism I heard there's a black dynamite sequel or anything anything that is bad or untoward.

210
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:29,440
Speaker 0: All it does is raise the test by which the media has to be reviewed.

211
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,760
Speaker 0: So some shit moe show that has its creepy moe bullshit.

212
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,127
Speaker 0: It's held to a higher standard.

213
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,030
Speaker 1: then it has to.

214
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,400
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna watch that it better be fucking incredible.

215
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:42,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, it better be the great Gatsby equivalent, right?

216
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,759
Speaker 0: So in my mind like a show like kill I kill the exploitation.

217
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:54,020
Speaker 0: it Has met so far the higher standard I have held it to in terms of its overall quality.

218
00:13:55,003 --> 00:14:04,519
Speaker 0: But many other shows with the same accoutrement shall we say to use a Sailor Moon term talents Has not lived up to even the most basic test.

219
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:09,400
Speaker 0: There's a reason we're not watching most of this anime that has come out recently.

220
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:11,649
Speaker 0: So we'll see we'll see.

221
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,903
Speaker 0: but to bring it back to Sailor Moon There's news.

222
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:19,297
Speaker 0: that wasn't news, but apparently it's news because everyone's saying this was making shit.

223
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:33,139
Speaker 0: up until now Everyone had assumed that the new Sailor Moon anime announced in August last year to air in December Last year and failure now announced that it's going to air in July.

224
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:39,740
Speaker 0: But I'm not super confident in that either considering reason news that they renamed the series Sailor Moon forever.

225
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:44,734
Speaker 0: We have literally seen no art from this.

226
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:46,340
Speaker 1: I've seen pictures of Sailor Moon.

227
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:52,720
Speaker 0: Yes, every picture I've seen related to this is something that's just scanned from the manga usually by a fan.

228
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,999
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought that I saw a picture of Sailor Moon that they drew.

229
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, she looks like Sailor Moon.

230
00:14:58,288 --> 00:14:58,589
Speaker 1: That's it.

231
00:14:58,609 --> 00:14:58,830
Speaker 1: Dad.

232
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,147
Speaker 1: That's still a picture from the show is a picture I don't know if it's from the show.

233
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,978
Speaker 0: that gives me promotional art a bull shot.

234
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:06,790
Speaker 1: Sure It's a promotional picture of Sailor Moon that they drew.

235
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,666
Speaker 1: the people who are animating the show stop for a minute and they drew a Picture Sailor Moon for the poster.

236
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:10,726
Speaker 1: it

237
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:26,355
Speaker 0: had been assumed by many people and we I said this Even when we did our how to or our Judge anime by its cover thing in anime Boston that it appears that it's going to be a reboot That is based very much more strictly on how the manga.

238
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:27,440
Speaker 1: I read the same thing.

239
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,831
Speaker 1: I that was that's all I ever thought this was gonna be.

240
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:31,760
Speaker 0: so I tried to verify a sequel.

241
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:35,131
Speaker 0: I had tried it could be a sequel actually to the anime.

242
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:39,310
Speaker 0: Yeah after Sailor Stars do the crystal millennium or something I don't know what the fuck that is.

243
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:39,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't know.

244
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:42,445
Speaker 0: All right Don't know anything about Sailor Moon.

245
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:43,730
Speaker 0: Who's the cat?

246
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:44,774
Speaker 0: Can you name the cat?

247
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,460
Speaker 1: moon moon Luna?

248
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,367
Speaker 1: All right, it's also because it's the same as.

249
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,900
Speaker 0: uh, you know, you know, there's two other cats.

250
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,166
Speaker 1: There's one that sort though.

251
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,473
Speaker 1: The main one's black.

252
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,498
Speaker 1: It has a moon on its head.

253
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:59,775
Speaker 1: Yep She is one that's sort of dark purple that has stars on its butt, right?

254
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:00,377
Speaker 0: Okay.

255
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:01,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm surprised.

256
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:04,580
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that this that cat is the one you know second and not the other main cat.

257
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,668
Speaker 1: I don't know any other cat Artemis the dude.

258
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,552
Speaker 1: There's a dude.

259
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:07,813
Speaker 1: Okay.

260
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,616
Speaker 1: What does that one look like?

261
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,580
Speaker 0: He's a white Luna.

262
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:10,887
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

263
00:16:10,908 --> 00:16:13,000
Speaker 1: I thought I just thought there was the black one and then the purple one.

264
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:28,144
Speaker 0: He shows up when Sailor V aka Sailor Venus shows up because Sailor V is actually a superhero on her own Before she finds out she's a sailor like straight up Like she uses her powers and has a cat kind of like Sailor Moon and has a TV show About

265
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:28,224
Speaker 1: her

266
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:31,420
Speaker 0: that she's in but she's also a real superhero.

267
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:41,171
Speaker 0: So Sailor Moon The girl is a fan of Sailor V and then meet Sailor V and it turns out that Sailor V is for real a sailor Scout and also a superhero.

268
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:42,137
Speaker 1: Okay.

269
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:48,046
Speaker 1: Yeah Let's not watch that show Too late for you.

270
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:51,140
Speaker 0: So I tried to find more information about the new Sailor Moon.

271
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,516
Speaker 0: It turns out that was just a giant clusterfuck of people making shit up.

272
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,480
Speaker 1: So it was all lies.

273
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,323
Speaker 1: It's not a reboot.

274
00:16:57,604 --> 00:17:12,520
Speaker 0: So that was people making shit up but being very good at guessing because it was announced scant days ago Officially that this is not a sequel and is not a remake of the anime but a new reboot adaptation of the manga.

275
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,522
Speaker 1: That's what.

276
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,188
Speaker 1: so I'm guess everybody guessed right?

277
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,492
Speaker 0: We probably didn't guess.

278
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:18,980
Speaker 1: it was probably known but I can't figure.

279
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,733
Speaker 1: There's no way people could have guessed that it all.

280
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:28,800
Speaker 0: I read it many places Having read a bunch of the manga and seen the original Sailor Moon all the way through including the three movies and the special.

281
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,794
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't want to see a reboot based on the manga because it's gonna be bad.

282
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:37,973
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying I Would have made the same guess But I wouldn't have coached it in terms of.

283
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,199
Speaker 0: this is what the studio said.

284
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:43,812
Speaker 0: Anyway, so now we know we'll see if it actually premieres in July.

285
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:53,362
Speaker 1: There's like a dub cast already set up in July 20-20 something 15 But 18.

286
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:54,429
Speaker 0: I'm really curious.

287
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,220
Speaker 0: I really want this to happen.

288
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:06,430
Speaker 0: I really want to see it because if I had to describe the Sailor Moon manga to people who have seen Sailor Moon Imagine Green Lantern universe, but with a lot of lesbians.

289
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:07,754
Speaker 1: That is what that is.

290
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:09,459
Speaker 1: What is that in shit in volume one?

291
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:12,007
Speaker 0: Print comes in pretty quick.

292
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,620
Speaker 0: It is Green Lantern space bullshit.

293
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:19,930
Speaker 0: There's a shield around this planet, but then this kind of thing It sounds like Star Control to shield around a planet.

294
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's shields around the place.

295
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:21,877

326
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:20,799
Speaker 1: So This is a thing of the day that involves games and technology perfect for Wednesday, huh?

327
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,240
Speaker 1: There's nothing to do with anime whatsoever unless I guess you count the fact that there was a Mario anime at some point.

328
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,788
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you're right.

329
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,774
Speaker 0: I keep forgetting about that.

330
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:32,793
Speaker 1: So there was This thing was all over the internet.

331
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:38,800
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen it I don't know how you how you must not internet at all besides geek nights in which case you're internetting all wrong.

332
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:43,100
Speaker 0: They're getting a filtered stream of only the hardest of brow.

333
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:49,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're internetting wrong if you're in geek nights before anything else anyway, so What these guys did it?

334
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:50,938
Speaker 1: Well this guy?

335
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,752
Speaker 1: Master June, I think his internet name is.

336
00:20:54,195 --> 00:21:00,260
Speaker 1: he took Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo and he hooked it up to some equipment.

337
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,319
Speaker 1: So it's like it, you know for time assisted speed running, right?

338
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,032
Speaker 1: So basically the equipment he hooked it up to had two multi taps.

339
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:13,358
Speaker 1: so he was as if there were eight controllers Connected to this Super Nintendo, right?

340
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,579
Speaker 1: and he goes into the first level while the level to the right of Yoshi's house, right.

341
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,115
Speaker 0: and He starts doing all this crazy the third level for people who know how to play that game.

342
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:28,775
Speaker 1: Yeah He starts jumping around and doing this crazy random shit, you know, well the computer is doing.

343
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,180
Speaker 1: you know, he scripted the controls.

344
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,965
Speaker 1: It's only inputting controls.

345
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,650
Speaker 1: He's only pushing buttons on the controller.

346
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,573
Speaker 1: He's not doing anything else.

347
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:38,301
Speaker 1: You can even see what buttons he's pushing, right and Through.

348
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:50,399
Speaker 1: pushing these buttons in this crazy sequence making Mario do all this random shit with like Yoshi's and all this craziness that happens It seems like just like random crazy hacks and weirdness that doesn't really get him very far in the game.

349
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,188
Speaker 1: eventually, I think he activates a p-block or something and The game sort of freaks out.

350
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,459
Speaker 1: and then the games like in this menu.

351
00:22:00,442 --> 00:22:05,065
Speaker 1: And in the menu there's three options Pong snake and quit.

352
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,876
Speaker 1: and if you choose Pong you play Pong with a Mario head.

353
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,425
Speaker 1: and if you choose snake you play snake With a Mario head.

354
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,439
Speaker 0: and I did not personally verify if this is a hoax.

355
00:22:14,821 --> 00:22:15,705
Speaker 0: This is

356
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:33,829
Speaker 1: all Scott 100% not a hoax because there is a separate video which is when this was premiered at Awesome games done quick, right which raised over a million dollars for cancer and is like the greatest thing to watch on twitch TV ever Which is also where they did that Metroid speedrun.

357
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:34,331
Speaker 1: We just saw.

358
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:35,896
Speaker 0: Oh my god, right.

359
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:45,252
Speaker 1: Oh my god, so And basically they had a rob the robot hooked up to the you know Super Nintendo right and they did it there.

360
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:53,693
Speaker 1: and then they had two guys after it was done play Pong and Snake and it was not the same Pong and snake.

361
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,100
Speaker 1: So it wasn't just like a recording, right?

362
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,407
Speaker 1: It was totally legit.

363
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,237
Speaker 1: and he basically what this guy's done.

364
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:03,608
Speaker 1: He's he's reprogrammed Basically through these controller ports.

365
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,820
Speaker 1: only he programmed the Super Nintendo to do something else.

366
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:09,636
Speaker 1: Well plus the Mario cartridge, right?

367
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,362
Speaker 1: Think about crazy.

368
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:17,438
Speaker 1: that is like he didn't you know open up a dev kit or recompile anything or any.

369
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:20,820
Speaker 1: all he did Was literally push buttons on controllers.

370
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:33,660
Speaker 1: imagine if you could push buttons on your game your Xbox controller and You're when you're playing Halo and you just push enough buttons That you've somehow loaded in all of counter-strike through the controller port and then the Xbox starts playing counter-strike.

371
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,204
Speaker 0: This is off the hook.

372
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:36,307
Speaker 1: It is ridiculous.

373
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,048
Speaker 1: I don't think it's ever.

374
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:44,153
Speaker 1: this might be the first time ever any game has been Reprogrammed through the controller ports alone.

375
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,494
Speaker 0: This is incredible Like I'm not even really sure what I would say about this.

376
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:50,856
Speaker 1: there's nothing to say about it It's just it is what it is.

377
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:52,685
Speaker 1: I've always like thought about.

378
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:57,522
Speaker 1: I've thought about this in the past like once or twice like could it be possible and I was and I was.

379
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:06,819
Speaker 1: the only way I could see it being possible would be if Somehow the game had like an interpreter in it and let you like, you know enter something like that.

380
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:10,176
Speaker 1: But I guess he you know was able to.

381
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:14,619
Speaker 1: I don't know But he had the eight controllers to enter the data real fast.

382
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:24,699
Speaker 0: You know this and Kurt the current state of speedruns basically Illustrates a greater point we can talk about someday in depth on geek nights in the modern world.

383
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:35,993
Speaker 0: No matter what your thing is Stepping up your game will never get you close to the people who have stepped up their game unless you are So the person stepping up your game in that area.

384
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:41,340
Speaker 1: either be a generalist Who's are you a lot of things or you step up your game a hundred times just like these guys.

385
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:51,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a gamer for example you've either got to be good at all games than general sense like E&M banks player of games good at games or you've got to pick one game.

386
00:24:52,542 --> 00:25:06,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look the people who become truly famous right in this world are people who max out one thing to be you know Sacrificing other things right like Michael Jordan basketball only a baseball.

387
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:12,068
Speaker 1: Well, yeah Didn't go so well Right Tiger Woods golf only his whole life.

388
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,392
Speaker 1: pretty much right.

389
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:22,200
Speaker 1: if you want to be that kind of somebody You have to sacrifice all your other things and that's why we are nobody's because we do too many things.

390
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have not quit our jobs to do geek nights full-time geek nights would be a lot better if we did this full-time.

391
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:31,182
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it wouldn't be but we do many many things I like to.

392
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:35,200
Speaker 0: I like to go to beaches and fuck around play Nidhogg.

393
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:38,423
Speaker 1: Let's met a moment.

394
00:25:38,864 --> 00:25:39,587
Speaker 0: All right met a moment.

395
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:43,058
Speaker 1: The book club book is I do by William Gibson.

396
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:43,760
Speaker 1: I finished reading it.

397
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,836
Speaker 0: Thank God next Thursday That means I got to pick a new book.

398
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:50,309
Speaker 0: So in the time it took you to read I drew.

399
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:57,192
Speaker 0: I read it again because I'd already read it in the past and then I read three Culture books in the time that you were reading three culture books.

400
00:25:57,372 --> 00:26:02,418
Speaker 0: I played many games of netrunner yep, so I know a lot about the culture now.

401
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:14,600
Speaker 0: and Seriously if you didn't read player of games from our previous book club before read that fucking book Seriously, because the rest of the culture books are great, but I think that one stands apart.

402
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:16,468
Speaker 1: I picked the right one.

403
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:20,889
Speaker 0: No, cuz that one tells one story All the other ones all the other ones.

404
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,918
Speaker 0: you have to already care about the culture.

405
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:23,260
Speaker 0: be like man.

406
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:24,438
Speaker 0: I wonder what's up with the culture?

407
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,054
Speaker 1: What's the the one that I didn't finish?

408
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:27,800
Speaker 1: you consider Phlebas?

409
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:29,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one only told one story the moral.

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, the moral of that one it no it tells two stars.

411
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,116
Speaker 0: the moral of that one is you're fucked.

412
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,311
Speaker 0: yeah The moral of use of weapons is weapons suck.

413
00:26:37,452 --> 00:26:38,135
Speaker 1: You're fucked.

414
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:38,959
Speaker 1: I know that.

415
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:43,220
Speaker 1: yeah I have to tell me that I don't need a book now the more that one is you are a weapon.

416
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:44,764
Speaker 1: Yes, that's also true.

417
00:26:44,784 --> 00:26:46,048
Speaker 0: Yep ideas are weapons.

418
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:46,971
Speaker 0: Everything's a weapon.

419
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:47,813
Speaker 1: that is well-known.

420
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,240
Speaker 1: Yeah book not needed message received.

421
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:54,780
Speaker 0: Yep, so far the message of look to win data is the culture is just awesome.

422
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,568
Speaker 0: It really sucks to live anywhere else.

423
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:59,079
Speaker 1: I also did not need more than one book to know that.

424
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,920
Speaker 0: yeah But the degree to which it is better anyway.

425
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:04,875

Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it's in Hartford.

460
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:44,770
Speaker 1: I think it's in Connecticut.

461
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:50,635
Speaker 1: I think Connecticut Connecticut Like if you're a nerd in Connecticut basically right.

463
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,506
Speaker 1: Go to play.

464
00:28:52,707 --> 00:28:54,920
Speaker 1: you know magic or any other sort of nerdy tabletop.

465
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,524
Speaker 0: You're just like watch anime with people.

466
00:28:56,564 --> 00:29:01,398
Speaker 0: basically Kinetic on is your local anime and gaming club if you live anywhere near Connecticut.

467
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:01,979
Speaker 1: pretty much.

468
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:09,638
Speaker 1: So there's a Connecticut con Tournament center that is like a you know all-year-round gaming place.

469
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:20,394
Speaker 0: also Kinetic ons board gaming tabletop content is Literally the best non packs non magfest gaming con there is yes In the u.s..

470
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:24,154
Speaker 1: Yes I'm not in terms of tabletop library.

471
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:24,980
Speaker 1: It's probably the best.

472
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,345
Speaker 0: Oh my god the tabletop library.

473
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:29,395
Speaker 0: there though magfest is much better now that cold guy commits.

474
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:33,912
Speaker 1: basically his entire Kinetic ons library is greater than cold guys library.

475
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:35,660
Speaker 1: not the cold guy has bad tasting games.

476
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,839
Speaker 1: I kind of yes a fuck ton of games, but it doesn't have that many.

477
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:40,284
Speaker 0: well He is but a man.

478
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:42,331
Speaker 0: that I'm saying is an organization.

479
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:42,672
Speaker 0: That's right.

480
00:29:42,692 --> 00:29:43,355
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

481
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,358
Speaker 1: It's exactly.

482
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:48,539
Speaker 0: yeah stay tuned We're gonna start ramping up the kinetic on panels workshop special events stuff.

483
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,260
Speaker 1: Is anything else in the calendar?

484
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,926
Speaker 1: I don't know.

485
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:56,579
Speaker 1: Stuff do your geeky thing.

486
00:29:57,702 --> 00:30:01,942
Speaker 0: So yeah, uh space dandy space Dandy.

487
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:06,575
Speaker 0: space dandy is the anime that many people are saying saved anime along with kill-all-kill space dandy.

488
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:10,487
Speaker 0: space dandy is a dandy in Space a dandy guy in the space.

489
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:24,051
Speaker 0: so people have been anticipating the show for a long time because mostly It's made by the cabi by people yep, and it has some superficial stylistic elements that are reminiscent of cowboy bebop But it's in space, but they're equally reminiscent of Lupin.

490
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,520
Speaker 1: the third money well can we view up was as well?

491
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the money.

492
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:29,129
Speaker 1: the money is who longs.

493
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:31,840
Speaker 1: so it might be the same universe in the distant future.

494
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,476
Speaker 0: I'm assuming it's the same universe, right?

495
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,990
Speaker 1: Also, it is airing on Adult Swim Cartoon Network.

496
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,380
Speaker 1: in fact it airs in the US before it airs in Japan.

497
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:43,539
Speaker 0: Is there space dandy dubcast set yet?

498
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:45,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's dubbed on TV.

499
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:46,413
Speaker 1: I don't know.

500
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,399
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it on TV.

501
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:49,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, no we watch it on the internet where it's up.

502
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:52,907
Speaker 1: there were some minor complaints with the dub as there are with all dubs Whatever.

503
00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:01,610
Speaker 0: yeah I realized recently that we always kind of talk about the cowboy bebop dub as being one of the greatest Dubs of anime ever done even though it pales before.

504
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:02,955
Speaker 0: I don't know dubbing.

505
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:12,300
Speaker 0: that happens for real movies Like why does anime fuck this up, but I've found on the internet that a lot of people really hate the cowboy bebop dub.

506
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:22,063
Speaker 0: It's not anime enough, okay, they like that anime bullshit dub that they're so used to That it doesn't sound enough like anime I found.

507
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,207
Speaker 1: oh, so they don't like.

508
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:26,760
Speaker 1: they have a b-bop dub because it's better and they like the other shitty dubs.

509
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't have people who talk like this all the time.

510
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:34,270
Speaker 1: Oh I thought it was just people who typically sub fan it.

511
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,020
Speaker 0: They know the sub fans hate it for their own reasons.

512
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:42,160
Speaker 0: Okay, they hate it cuz it doesn't have the right cast as in the original Japanese cast sure.

513
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:49,999
Speaker 0: And they also quietly Back away when you try to point out that mushroom Samba's sub the Japanese voice acting in that is kind of bullshit.

514
00:31:52,186 --> 00:31:53,477
Speaker 0: But I digress space dandy.

515
00:31:54,924 --> 00:32:00,220
Speaker 0: It's hard to really Describe space dandy without just telling you what happens.

516
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:03,510
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not even sure what happened in this show.

517
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,980
Speaker 0: So let's recap in episode 1 the entire cat main cast.

518
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,084
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

519
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:12,000
Speaker 1: So the main premise is a guy space dandy who is way dandy, right?

520
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,020
Speaker 1: He's so he's sort of like a combination of you know, it turns a cowboy b-bop, right?

521
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,434
Speaker 1: He's a combination of spike and the cowboy guy and but also Lupin.

522
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,140
Speaker 1: Lupin is already in spike.

523
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,066
Speaker 1: That's like saying yeah.

524
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's milk in this butter You know.

525
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:36,566
Speaker 0: one way you could put him is imagine kind of like how Andy in Cowboy b-bop was almost imagining of what someone like spike could have been without Tragedy in his past.

526
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:42,365
Speaker 0: space dandy is without tragedy and without forethought Yeah, living in a moment.

527
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:47,580
Speaker 1: So wackiness level is way high right and the other aspects are toned down a bit.

528
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,289
Speaker 1: So this guy dandy, he's not man.

529
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:50,971
Speaker 0: That's very important.

530
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:51,934
Speaker 0: He's a butt man.

531
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,840
Speaker 0: Only amateurs are into boobs, right?

532
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Speaker 1: So he's a space guy in a spaceship right much like spike was and whatnot, but he's not bounty hunting say butts.

533
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,686
Speaker 1: He's doing something similar.

534
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:05,600
Speaker 1: He is looking for rare aliens.

535
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,748
Speaker 1: So any alien I mean, it's basically it's.

536
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:13,571
Speaker 1: it must be if it's in the cowboy universe with oolongs and whatnot It's in a distant future or faraway place.

537
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,900
Speaker 1: Well, it can't be that far away from earth because actually mentioned earth.

538
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,575
Speaker 1: So it's in a distant time in the future, right?

539
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:25,820
Speaker 1: So there's all kinds of alien races unlike me how I bebop where there's just humans, right?

540
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:30,115
Speaker 1: And there's so many alien races all over the place.

541
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,040
Speaker 1: There's more than Star Wars.

542
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,138
Speaker 1: It is insane how many different aliens there are.

543
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:35,988
Speaker 1: So and there's tons and tons of aliens.

544
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:40,040
Speaker 0: like the aliens are all like the background shots in red line, right?

545
00:33:40,923 --> 00:33:52,374
Speaker 1: So this guy dandy He is trying to basically find alien species that are extremely rare or perhaps even undiscovered and if he brings them to the alien Registration place he gets mad moneys.

546
00:33:52,434 --> 00:34:02,400
Speaker 0: if he does that now He's nominally doing this to get money And I think the only thing he spends money on is food at the space equivalent of Hooters, right?

547
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:03,918
Speaker 1: Which is called boobies?

548
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:08,719
Speaker 0: so That seemed dumb and I was like really boobies.

549
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:17,869
Speaker 0: But then we get this panning shot and you see the boobies splice pep space platform in the distance and it's just two gigantic Boobs, yes this show.

550
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,494
Speaker 1: So yeah, this is where the boobies come in.

551
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:29,435
Speaker 1: The one thing I have with boobies How come all the girls at boobies are Human girls, why aren't there alien girls at boobies who are not human?

552
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:30,840
Speaker 0: or was that one fish girl?

553
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,714
Speaker 1: Sure, but she was humanoid body with boobies, right?

554
00:34:34,754 --> 00:34:35,900
Speaker 1: How come there are out there?

555
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,322
Speaker 0: I'll come.

556
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:39,072
Speaker 0: maybe he's on the humanoid floor or maybe no.

557
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:43,594
Speaker 1: how come the other Aliens are on the same floor who are not humanoids.

558
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:44,719
Speaker 0: You're telling me all the not.

559
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,141
Speaker 0: How do you know?

560
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:47,331
Speaker 0: there are other restaurants called egg sacks?

561
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:49,139
Speaker 1: Sure, but how come the non?

562
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,808
Speaker 1: Humanoid aliens?

563
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,199
Speaker 1: men we presume right?

564
00:34:53,739 --> 00:35:00,080
Speaker 1: I can tell you why these people of a sexuality desiring women are hanging out at boobies looking at humanoid boobies.

565
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,099
Speaker 0: I can tell you why and liking them.

566
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:06,574
Speaker 1: I can tell you as the as the alien unit far distant universe.

567
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:11,640
Speaker 1: like media like promoted You know human shape as the ideal form of beauty.

568
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,260
Speaker 1: So now like alien women can't get laid because all the alien dudes only want to go with human lady.

569
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,203
Speaker 0: I will tell you why.

570
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:29,600
Speaker 0: if I'm alive in a future where there are aliens and cool stuff I would probably check out an alien strip club just to see what the deal was with their equivalent of if they have females.

571
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:34,279
Speaker 1: Sure, but this didn't look like tourists were coming through for their one time looking at the humans.

572
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:38,243
Speaker 0: Ah, I mean, maybe there's all these other floors We really don't know.

573
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:41,355
Speaker 0: that is not the part of the world that and it's called boobies.

574
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:42,580
Speaker 0: It is called boobies.

575
00:35:43,102 --> 00:35:45,995
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a themed restaurant like check out the humans and their boobies.

576
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,871
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Sure, cuz most of the client.

577
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:51,243
Speaker 1: I mean you got a pretty thin Explanation there.

578
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:53,930
Speaker 1: the reason it's way way way humans are watching the show.

579
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,851
Speaker 0: my explanation of something in space dandy is I think space dandy Is thin sure so?

580
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,659
Speaker 0: That one I don't think he's actually trying to find rare aliens cuz he fucking doesn't.

581
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:09,596
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean how many bounties despite cash, but he doesn't even try.

582
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:10,058
Speaker 1: he tried.

583
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:15,160
Speaker 1: No, he doesn't a little bit fucking he just kind of walk even went to the alien registration place.

584
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind.

585
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:20,180
Speaker 0: he just kind of walks in the direction and stuff happens to him and he's super competent.

586
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:31,888
Speaker 1: He reacts to things in a spike Spiegel level like okay Sometimes he does but other times he gets like in an inspector gadget situation where he totally fucks up, but it ends up succeeding Yeah in the first episode.

587
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:32,713
Speaker 1: especially like.

588
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:37,298
Speaker 1: so like action scenes He would like go oops and then somehow you beat the bad guy with that oops move.

589
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:39,019
Speaker 1: Totally expected gadget.

590
00:36:39,461 --> 00:36:46,020
Speaker 0: He has a robot who seems to be referred to as a she who just robot is smart and vacuum and way out of date.

591
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,888
Speaker 1: It's like a crappy version of bemo.

592
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kind of pissed off version of bemo.

593
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen bemo pissed off and then he meets this beetle juicien because he's stupid.

594
00:36:55,995 --> 00:37:04,420
Speaker 0: but the beetle juicien is actually stupid Yeah, and he is just kind of an otaku pervert nerd in a cat body.

595
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:13,860
Speaker 1: But he's beautifully animated Most of the things are beautifully and I know this show is so beautiful to watch and the designs of all the aliens are really unique.

596
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:24,931
Speaker 0: and and the attention to detail on the facial expressions and these three jackass is just basically the the meow The the cat guy joins the shit because he's like.

597
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:30,112
Speaker 0: I know where some aliens are and then he's like randomly Points at some spot on the space map is like they're there.

598
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,940
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and space dandy's like really?

599
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:38,607
Speaker 0: Okay, and they go there and they almost die and then at the end of the episode they get trapped and space dandy's like QT use the thing.

600
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,460
Speaker 0: so QT is like, okay and he hits the button.

601
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:40,942
Speaker 0: He's like.

602
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:41,525
Speaker 0: what the thing do?

603
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:43,154
Speaker 0: he's like self-destruct and then they all die.

604
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,144
Speaker 0: and that's the end of the episode And the beginning of next episode.

605
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:47,068
Speaker 1: they don't even mention that.

606
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:47,389
Speaker 0: Yeah.

607
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:49,777
Speaker 1: Well, so so here's the other thing.

608
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:50,680
Speaker 1: there's bad guys.

609
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,237
Speaker 0: There's a plot thread that's contiguous that doesn't actually directly involve space dandy.

610
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:56,100
Speaker 0: It's meta to him.

611
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:57,465
Speaker 1: So there are these bad guys.

612
00:37:57,505 --> 00:37:58,549
Speaker 1: and how do we know they're bad guys?

613
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,500
Speaker 1: Cuz they're so obviously stereotypically designed as bad guys.

614
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,900
Speaker 0: So Commodore Perry who is just a giant flaming floating skull, huh?

615
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,406
Speaker 1: And it's a Japanese made show.

616
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:13,660
Speaker 0: and the guys named Commodore Perry interesting and dr Gel who I think is one of the pirates in one piece, right?

617
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,310
Speaker 1: And then there's the guy on the TV screen I guess the Emperor who I'm pretty sure is a flaming skull.

618
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,140
Speaker 1: and what the fuck is better than a flamethrower Perry?

619
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:24,048
Speaker 1: Nothing flaming skulls are the best.

620
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:25,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder.

621
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,920
Speaker 0: I wonder if he's a distant relative of infernal cop.

622
00:38:28,061 --> 00:38:29,026
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter my favorite.

623
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:31,038
Speaker 1: He's my favorite guy now because he's a flaming skull.

624
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:37,100
Speaker 1: Yeah All flaming skulls good and ghost rider while awesome is probably the worst of all flaming skulls.

625
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,304
Speaker 1: So that tells you how good.

626
00:38:38,324 --> 00:38:42,699
Speaker 0: so the meta plot is Commodore Perry the flaming skull ordered.

627
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:49,580
Speaker 0: Dr Gel the the one-piece villain to find space dandy and kill him supposedly or something.

628
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,412
Speaker 0: We don't know why because space daddy has.

629
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:54,280
Speaker 1: we don't even know that these are bad guys.

630
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,475
Speaker 1: The only thing we know is that they look like guys and act like bad guy.

631
00:38:57,515 --> 00:39:01,410
Speaker 1: what we know is that At all they could be doing this to save the universe.

632
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:05,309
Speaker 0: what we know is that their ship is a giant Statue of Liberty head With a ball gag.

633
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:06,217
Speaker 1: we do know that.

634
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:09,552
Speaker 0: What is it with these new anime and ball gags?

635
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:15,731
Speaker 0: I mean Goma gory's Actually has an explanation for that does have an explanation.

636
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,440
Speaker 1: the Statue of Liberty is just I guess stylistic whatever.

637
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,680
Speaker 0: I wonder if that is actually the Statue of Liberty.

638
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:25,620
Speaker 1: It could I. it could possibly be but that would give us a really good idea of how big that ship is.

639
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,420
Speaker 1: Which is not that big because the Statue of Liberty's head is not that big.

640
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:34,120
Speaker 1: So so I get it's not the Statue of Liberty because you could not make a spaceship out of something that small.

641
00:39:34,382 --> 00:39:35,759
Speaker 0: Well, you could make it walk through Manhattan.

642
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:41,420
Speaker 1: The Statue of Liberty in its entirety could maybe make a small spaceship for humans.

643
00:39:41,743 --> 00:39:43,040
Speaker 1: That was like a real space.

644
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:51,996
Speaker 1: We don't know how many people are on that ship But the Statue of Liberty's head alone could not make a giant space-varying vessel that had an entire fleet around it of which it was the biggest ship.

645
00:39:52,860 --> 00:40:01,838
Speaker 0: so Episode one ends with our entire cast being killed by a self-destructive device and begins with these guys trying to find the space dandy.

646
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:06,188
Speaker 0: episode 2 These guys are trying to find the space dandy again.

647
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:13,016
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and space dandy's personality is completely 180 now He's a boob man, and he's not into butts anymore.

648
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:16,800
Speaker 0: Yep, and I almost think that's irrelevant.

649
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm well, I'm thinking based on only two episodes of information.

650
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:24,367
Speaker 1: Is that Basically you can't die.

651
00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:27,500
Speaker 1: It's like a Kenny from South Park situation, right?

652
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:33,420
Speaker 1: He's like this invincible guy and he has some effect on the universe right this crazy shit happens to him.

653
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:40,540
Speaker 1: he seems to luck out whatever and This is why they're trying to hunt him down, but he doesn't know it about himself, right?

654
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,340
Speaker 1: He doesn't know anything that he's special or whatever.

655
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,579
Speaker 0: I think him and everyone around him literally cannot die but don't remember anything that happens to them.

656
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:52,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, QT seems to remember and seems to be vaguely pissed off about the real plot.

657
00:40:52,874 --> 00:41:01,020
Speaker 1: is some sort of meta thing that you Know like that something along those lines and the bad guys know it and the robot seems to know it.

658
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:08,740
Speaker 1: but space dandy doesn't have enough memory or coherence himself and Neither does the meow thing really?

659
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:18,874
Speaker 1: so it's sort of like, you know, you're just sort of watching it from the wrong perspective to understand what's really happening and It's gonna get crazy serious.

660
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:21,868
Speaker 1: Oh, yes So this revealed but maybe not that serious.

661
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,766
Speaker 0: dandy and meow died again in the second episode and meow died I think twice.

662
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:31,460
Speaker 1: yeah, they died when they were like ejected into the vacuum of space But then they were alive at the end of the episode.

663
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,158
Speaker 0: They just yeah, but every time they die like the next cut is just everyone fine again.

664
00:41:36,178 --> 00:41:37,182
Speaker 1: Yep They don't even.

665
00:41:37,202 --> 00:41:39,209
Speaker 1: and this is large time skips.

666
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:45,327
Speaker 1: not super large like months, but super large like Shit could have happened in between there and there.

667
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:47,414
Speaker 1: that was not explained and could be important.

668
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:55,813
Speaker 0: and everyone around space dandy Like all the people who get noticed are Badasses in some sense and seem to be secret agents of some kind.

669
00:41:56,134 --> 00:41:57,758
Speaker 0: Yeah and seemed to be against dr.

670
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:02,154
Speaker 1: Gal and Commodore Perry, well, it doesn't seem like anyone even knows.

671
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:08,250
Speaker 0: gal and Perry exist But I fought off the guys who were after space dandy.

672
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:11,462
Speaker 1: sure but you know, I don't know You know what?

673
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:12,810
Speaker 0: There's nothing else to say.

674
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:13,614
Speaker 0: watch your show.

675
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:14,600
Speaker 0: You're an anime fan.

676
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:17,089
Speaker 0: This is the show to be watching.

677
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:18,915
Speaker 0: if you're not already watching kill la kill.

678
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:25,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think though I mean, you know in terms of the promise of the show It was gonna save animes just like the promise of all these other shows.

679
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:29,160
Speaker 1: I don't think space dandy alone would have saved any anime.

680
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,552
Speaker 1: No, but well, here's the thing at least not based on two episodes.

681
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,940
Speaker 1: We're wait till I kill the first episode.

682
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:36,086
Speaker 1: That was enough right.

683
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:41,027
Speaker 0: Monica saved anime for people who are Into anime and paid attention to.

684
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,194
Speaker 1: Monica saved anime in three episodes.

685
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:45,260
Speaker 1: So we have to give space dandy at least one more.

686
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:52,200
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is that kill la kill brought a lot more people who were more far-flung in anime fandom back into anime.

687
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:57,680
Speaker 0: Space dandy is the kind of thing you could show on TV and someone who doesn't watch anime like what the fuck is it?

688
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,144
Speaker 1: That's a netrunner meetup, right?

689
00:42:59,165 --> 00:43:03,360
Speaker 1: There's you know, some people who are you know nerdy and other people aren't just in a netrunner.

690
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:05,040
Speaker 1: They're shocking, right?

691
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:11,317
Speaker 1: So, you know some animes came up and like three people were like space dandy.

692
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:12,220
Speaker 1: all shit.

693
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:19,529
Speaker 1: That was that with a time when there had only been one episode and and they would tell me like yeah I really only watch anime like in cartoon network or never.

694
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:22,320
Speaker 1: but they were like, holy shit that show that was and they were like.

695
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:30,715
Speaker 1: so the people who are you know, the Casual anime fan who aren't crunchy rolling or fan subbing right?

696
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:31,860
Speaker 1: They're into this.

697
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:33,920
Speaker 1: It's it's a it is a hit with that.

698
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,732
Speaker 0: Well, I get the impression because this is the kind of show that if I just showed one episode of this to my dad You would probably watch the rest of it.

699
00:43:40,873 --> 00:43:45,583
Speaker 0: Maybe I mean good chance, so Watch your show.

700
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:47,972
Speaker 1: She's a boob and or but man anime fans.

701
00:43:48,555 --> 00:43:52,511
Speaker 0: It's I Don't know what else to say because I don't know where this show is going.

702
00:43:52,912 --> 00:43:56,591
Speaker 1: if you're watching some crappy other show You have time.

703
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:59,990
Speaker 0: you have time Blah blah blah not technically my and you have.

704
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,560
Speaker 1: if you have time to watch that shit you have time to watch this.

705
00:44:02,861 --> 00:44:12,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's not you know, it is remains to be foreseen the exact quality of this show overall You know, there's yet to be determined, but I guarantee it's better than all those.

706
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,708
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm watching yo-wa pedal.

707
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,380
Speaker 1: if I can watch you a pedal I can watch these.

708
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:22,534
Speaker 0: My life has entered the sort of golden eight like this renaissance of watching animation.

709
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:25,985
Speaker 0: because right now look adventure time started again Archer started again.

710
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:28,554
Speaker 0: I'm venture brothers is kind of on hiatus.

711
00:44:28,754 --> 00:44:29,637
Speaker 0: I got space dandy.

712
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:30,400
Speaker 0: I got kill la kill.

713
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,624
Speaker 0: I got silver spoon.

714
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:32,988
Speaker 0: I got so much animation.

715
00:44:33,008 --> 00:44:34,734
Speaker 0: You know, you just reminded me of huh?

716
00:44:35,315 --> 00:44:39,230
Speaker 1: So on Cartoon hangover they posted a video.

717
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:42,464
Speaker 1: they interviewed one Yonan Vasquez.

718
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:50,449
Speaker 1: I saw that because you know why they interviewed him not because he just stopped in the office Although he did because I'm assuming that they're bringing his shit back.

719
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,010
Speaker 1: No.

720
00:44:51,211 --> 00:45:00,351
Speaker 0: No, he is writing an episode of I Didn't even mention bravest warriors, which I fell behind on.

721
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:02,760
Speaker 0: I gotta watch her and you know, what's not in that episode?

722
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,904
Speaker 1: Ger cat bug.

723
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:06,710
Speaker 1: and he was like, there's no cat bug.

724
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,211
Speaker 1: Don't hate me.

725
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:09,700
Speaker 0: What I hate him now cat bug.

726
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:12,200
Speaker 1: He said he likes cat bug but didn't put cat bug in his episode.

727
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:16,600
Speaker 1: So yeah cat bug is like ten BMO's also now and I know what that guy looks like.

728
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,952
Speaker 1: He's younger than I thought I thought he was old.

729
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:41,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, so It's problematic because I'm watching so many shows suddenly not even counting a House of Cards that it's cutting into my time for other stuff like playing games, you know, it's show I've been watching lately CVS NFL football On Fox, yeah, you know what I almost did.

730
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:46,603
Speaker 0: I almost bought tickets to the Red Wings Rangers game at MSG Found tickets.

731
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:47,587
Speaker 1: how much was it?

732
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,132

Speaker 1: Actually five three three three three is about a little over three thousand dollars.

765
00:47:13,181 --> 00:47:15,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're sitting in the top deck for three.

766
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:16,460
Speaker 0: No, it's a little lower than that.

767
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,168
Speaker 0: It was two seats three thousand each not for both.

768
00:47:19,188 --> 00:47:23,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they were one seat apart for that amount of money.

769
00:47:24,122 --> 00:47:26,634
Speaker 1: The camera equipment we could buy to make videos.

770
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:39,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Yeah, actually you know getting back into meta stuff stay tuned because Scott and I kind of agree that it's time for a stepping up of game because we've we've cast our Making video content feelers in a lot of directions.

771
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:49,655
Speaker 1: also at the aforementioned CES the camera that I've been waiting to buy was at least Shittily fakily teased by taking another camera and putting a sticker on it.

772
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:58,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Eventually a camera that isn't just an old camera with a sticker on it will be made and produced Supposedly within some months and I'll buy it.

773
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,240
Speaker 0: Scott and I are of agreement that we've cast all these seeds out.

774
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,538
Speaker 0: We did you know, we did that pony show and then we did geek nights presents, which we're gonna keep doing.

775
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:14,109
Speaker 0: Don't worry we're just been a hiatus for a while and Scott's been doing his netrunner and we've been practicing with streaming and Some of those things look like a correct path.

776
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,602
Speaker 0: So we're both willing to spend money to step up the game All right.

777
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:18,888
Speaker 0: So anyway, stay tuned.

778
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:20,717

Speaker 1: when I Indian

783

Speaker 0: when that fucking cat ate space dandy's ramen and he's got the naruto like stuck to his cheek like he didn't Even care and then it just fell on the ground and he didn't eat it

784
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,654
