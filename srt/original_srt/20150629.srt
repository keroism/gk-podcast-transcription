1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,282
Speaker 0: It's Monday, June 29th, 2015.

2
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:13,783
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:16,630
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:20,589
Speaker 0: If one were to build a PC today, what should one buy?

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,429
Speaker 0: The answer is kind of to wait until September.

6
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,102
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:33,370
Speaker 1: So this weekend despite it being summertime the weather was not the greatest weather.

8
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:40,910
Speaker 0: it was actually really good that the weather was crappy because I had a lot of Kineticon work to finish and had it been sunny that might not have gotten done.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,076
Speaker 1: I also had a lot of Kineticon work to finish as well as cleaning my apartment which is the dirtiest ever.

10
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:56,218
Speaker 1: it was so dirty that I dusted and the spot that I dusted immediately upon looking back upon it as the dust sweepy thing passed over had dust on it.

11
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,676
Speaker 0: I gotta tell you once I bought that that fancy air filter and I just leave it on whenever I'm not home.

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,610
Speaker 0: that really really cut down on the dust in the apartment.

13
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:07,770
Speaker 1: Should I really spend some bunch of money on a big loud machine?

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,310
Speaker 0: Thing is the difference is I have more need of it because we also have a lot of bunny fluff floating around the apartment.

15
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:14,928
Speaker 1: Also I leave my windows open.

16
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:18,983
Speaker 0: Oh yeah if you leave your windows open that's just.

17
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:23,252
Speaker 0: that's your air filter versus Queens at that point Pretty much.

18
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:28,829
Speaker 1: You should see the filth that is on like in the windows like on the windowsills and whatnot.

19
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:32,650
Speaker 0: I washed the outside of my windows not that long ago.

20
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,310
Speaker 0: The squeegee turned black.

21
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:36,610
Speaker 1: Yeah I need to get a squeegee anyway.

22
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,487
Speaker 1: Oh that's what I forgot to buy on Amazon.

23
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:38,830
Speaker 1: anyway.

24
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:41,830
Speaker 0: I got a really good squeegee by the way.

25
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,984
Speaker 1: So after I did all the cleaning of the you know I cleaned from the back to the front so everything went out the front door right.

26
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:50,765
Speaker 1: I asked how to do the laundry that has been piling up.

27
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:55,349
Speaker 1: so I go to do the laundry and you know my laundry room changed from using quarters using a magic card.

28
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:58,749
Speaker 1: Yeah a while ago and I've talked about how you can hack the card or whatever right.

29
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,030
Speaker 0: Yeah your apartment building also seems to have the slowest fucking washers in the world.

30
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,209
Speaker 1: They're a little faster now since they changed them.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,081
Speaker 0: Mine are 22 minutes.

32
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,210
Speaker 1: These are like 40-something minutes.

33
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,930
Speaker 0: Ugh I could not live like that.

34
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,169
Speaker 0: You live like an animal.

35
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:18,170
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll bring my clothes here because when I went over to the fridge to get the card that is you know attached to a fridge magnet it was not there.

36
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:18,955
Speaker 0: What?

37
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,208
Speaker 0: How do you... I... Did someone steal it?

38
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:23,833
Speaker 1: I don't know.

39
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:27,712
Speaker 1: the card was gone and the card is basically cash because it stores all its information.

40
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:29,541
Speaker 1: in itself there's no internet or database.

41
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:32,979
Speaker 1: so you could hack the card and fill it with a bunch of money if you could decrypt it.

42
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:40,350
Speaker 1: but the card was gone and I searched for it in all likely places and it was gone and I figured well there's only like at most 40 bucks on there probably less.

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,269
Speaker 0: There's only one option you must have put it somewhere weird and forgotten about it.

44
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,689
Speaker 1: I always put it back on the fridge but it was there.

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,607
Speaker 0: Well apparently you didn't.

46
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,675
Speaker 1: So I went downstairs.

47
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:54,362
Speaker 1: I'm like huh maybe someone left their card in the laundry room and someone did and I checked the serial number and it wasn't mine.

48
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:58,339
Speaker 1: so I'd go to try to fill it up with money on the internet because that's how it works.

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,802
Speaker 1: it's really weird and it says nope that card belongs to someone else fuck you and I'm like alrighty.

50
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:09,770
Speaker 0: then so I filled out the form Wait so you tried to steal someone else's card.

51
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,290
Speaker 1: No they left it in the laundry room just like it had been there for a long time.

52
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:14,643
Speaker 0: Okay how long like?

53
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:15,370
Speaker 0: yeah like two minutes.

54
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,896
Speaker 1: It had 75 cents left on it.

55
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,241
Speaker 1: it didn't even do one load.

56
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:22,198
Speaker 1: so I put the card back and I fill out the form to say mail me a new card.

57
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,546
Speaker 1: but meanwhile I can't do laundry.

58
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:24,714
Speaker 1: I can't put quarters in.

59
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:25,789
Speaker 1: you have to have the card.

60
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:29,868
Speaker 0: Well you could bring your laundry here but that means going home and taking the subway and not biking.

61
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,228
Speaker 1: So I gave up as much laundry as I could to the Greek lady to wash for me.

62
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,530
Speaker 1: I hope it's ready when I get home because I don't have any clothes to wear.

63
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,398
Speaker 0: I am out of underwear.

64
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:44,988
Speaker 0: in fact I bike to work wearing my bike shorts but I can't wear those like in the office because they're a biker diaper with like the big pad on the butt The chamois.

65
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:50,590
Speaker 1: So uh Chamois.

66
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,180
Speaker 0: So I leave at work and was commando.

67
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,950
Speaker 0: commando because I don't have any more clean underwear.

68
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,470
Speaker 1: Just wear dirty underwear.

69
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:00,110
Speaker 0: Well so I could wear.

70
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:00,809
Speaker 1: Wear your loincloths.

71
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:08,173
Speaker 0: I have boxers and loincloths and those are fine but I can't really like bike to work in those or anything.

72
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:16,358
Speaker 0: uh my actual like nice underwear like the super tight like the sports ones those are all dirty and dirty.

73
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:16,740
Speaker 0: sports.

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,089
Speaker 0: well wear smells like dead things like it.

75
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,168
Speaker 0: that shit needs to be washed.

76
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,069
Speaker 1: The smell won't escape your pants.

77
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,870
Speaker 0: It might It might It might It might.

78
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:27,963
Speaker 1: Anyway so that really sucked.

79
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:28,990
Speaker 1: I couldn't do my laundry.

80
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,290
Speaker 0: You know it's funny how the failover uh scenario.

81
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:35,933
Speaker 1: I couldn't even carry all my laundry to the Greek lady because I only have two laundry bags.

82
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,009
Speaker 1: when I pick it up tonight I'm probably gonna bring her some more.

83
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,790
Speaker 0: You uh you waited too long to do laundry.

84
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,860
Speaker 1: I did wait a very long time to do laundry.

85
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:49,410
Speaker 1: I would have noticed the card missing probably closer to the time that it went missing because who knows how long it's been gone.

86
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:59,089
Speaker 1: You know it's funny because my work had something happen where like May it's a good chance it may have just fallen off that fridge magnet thing and into like a bag and got thrown out in the trash.

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,850
Speaker 0: That's not infeasible.

88
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,270
Speaker 1: No it's very feasible.

89
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,550
Speaker 0: I would not leave something important stuck to my fridge.

90
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:05,871
Speaker 0: It has.

91
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:10,227
Speaker 1: it came with this magnet like it was intended to be put onto this magnet.

92
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,909
Speaker 1: it has like a little card sleeve.

93
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:17,690
Speaker 0: I have one drawer and in that drawer is everything important.

94
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:22,670
Speaker 1: I have a drawer as such but that drawer also includes other things.

95
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,765
Speaker 0: Yeah you know what that drawer has my wallet my passport my uh keys.

96
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:33,875
Speaker 0: uh my extra credit cards my second wallet has a shit I don't have to carry everywhere I go like oyster cards and stuff I'm gonna put.

97
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:36,308
Speaker 1: when I get the replacement card it's probably gonna be empty.

98
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:38,054
Speaker 1: I'm gonna fill it up with new money which sucks.

99
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:44,227
Speaker 1: but uh I will be sure to put it in a better place and I'm probably never gonna lose it again.

100
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,004
Speaker 0: Yeah you know as much as I'd like a card like that in my apartment building.

101
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:52,542
Speaker 0: those systems I'm not super trusting of like the RIT.

102
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:53,870
Speaker 0: one never worked that well either.

103
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,341
Speaker 1: The RIT one was better because at least that one used internet Exactly except when the system was down.

104
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:01,128
Speaker 0: and then fuck you you can't do laundry.

105
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:02,456
Speaker 0: no one can do laundry.

106
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,889
Speaker 0: there's no fail-safe fallback.

107
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,417
Speaker 0: That's also a problem At least with quarters as shitty as they are.

108
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,848
Speaker 0: the fallback is I can go to the bank and get quarters.

109
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,050
Speaker 1: They should let you use quarters when the thing isn't working.

110
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,650
Speaker 0: I in fact only recently burned through.

111
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,820
Speaker 1: But then they have to send someone to pick up the quarters.

112
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,669
Speaker 1: that's why the system makes them so much money more than quarters do because now they have to whole employee.

113
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:36,377
Speaker 1: they don't have to hire if the money just gets you know sent to them also That is true like a. They also get the money immediately like there's 75 cents on that card in the laundry room that no one's ever gonna use ever.

114
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:39,790
Speaker 1: they got that 75 cents and no one had to do any laundry.

115
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,366
Speaker 1: yep They also don't have to pay for any water or any soap or anything.

116
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:44,652
Speaker 1: all they do is maintain the machines.

117
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:45,435
Speaker 1: that's it.

118
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,043
Speaker 1: yeah it's like install machines maintain them.

119
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:49,669
Speaker 1: money just comes.

120
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,814
Speaker 1: it's the greatest business.

121
00:06:51,738 --> 00:06:55,129
Speaker 1: have one customer service person on staff or anyone who calls with a problem with their card.

122
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,387
Speaker 0: Well that's what like in the old days like crappy businesses run by old people.

123
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,116
Speaker 0: they'd rather you pay cash because they don't want to pay those credit card transaction fees modern smart businesses.

124
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:10,420
Speaker 0: they'd rather you pay with your card no matter what because handling cash is a pain in the ass you notice to all.

125
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,792
Speaker 0: modern hit businesses have a garbage like.

126
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:17,328
Speaker 0: sometimes they don't even have a cash machine like a cash drawer.

127
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:18,672
Speaker 0: I've got hooked up to their POS.

128
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:34,771
Speaker 0: they have an iPad with a square or something on it to process payments all automatic and if you pay cash they're like and they get out like a change box and just shove the money in there because cash is such a tiny minority of what they do so in the news.

129
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,878
Speaker 0: this is relatively recent news.

130
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,672
Speaker 0: I'm kind of surprised how little people are talking about it.

131
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:46,917
Speaker 0: but this news builds upon a lot of things that have happened recently and by recently I mean over the last few years.

132
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:51,236
Speaker 0: so I'm not gonna explain it all to you because frankly you can read this shit on the internet.

133
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:53,344
Speaker 0: but if you haven't been attention.

134
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:57,659
Speaker 0: USB 2 is like super old and obsolete USB 3.

135
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:02,116
Speaker 1: I have a lot of USB 2 devices and a lot of devices that use USB 2.

136
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:05,589
Speaker 0: now yeah but it doesn't matter because USB 3 is 100% backward compatible.

137
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,171
Speaker 1: that is true.

138
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:15,034
Speaker 0: the problem with USB 3 is that the cables on the B end are way different and kind of stupid.

139
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:34,779
Speaker 0: so if you ever see like a phone or device like a hard drive that on the hard drive end has like a USB B connector with like this other bullshit connector stacked on top of it or like a USB micro that has like another micro kind of stuck next to it that is how USB 3 connected for the most part.

140
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,770
Speaker 0: so a lot of people and also the A end is different.

141
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,861
Speaker 1: people didn't realize it's the same shape.

142
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,039
Speaker 0: so it fits yeah but it has more connectors like yes it does so long.

143
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:56,758
Speaker 0: story short thunderbolt was sort of the successor to firewire which is completely dead at this point even though all pro audio stuff pretty much still requires firewire and that's not going to go anytime soon.

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,997
Speaker 0: as a result that means I need firewire because we still use a maki onyx.

145
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,041
Speaker 0: I'm not replacing that thing.

146
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:15,533
Speaker 0: that thing was real expensive but USB 3 kind of came about is useful is kind of adopted but thunderbolt way faster does a lot more things.

147
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:17,136
Speaker 0: USB 3.1 has come out.

148
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:23,853
Speaker 0: USB 3.1 and thunderbolt 3 are going to use the same cable.

149
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,849
Speaker 1: so even no matter what device you have you're going to be good.

150
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:35,340
Speaker 1: you're going to see a lot of similar cables everywhere replacing all the USB cable and that cable is going to use the USB C standard.

151
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:45,336
Speaker 0: now I've talked about this on an older episode of geek nights when I realized that nobody seems to know how USB works and what an A and a B end is and why I got a bad idea.

152
00:09:45,857 --> 00:10:02,423
Speaker 0: so USB C it doesn't matter what direction you plug it in much like a lightning cable yes but the important thing is thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 are both going to use the same cable even though they are very different formats.

153
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:03,888
Speaker 0: protocols yes.

154
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,504
Speaker 0: so as a result there finally is effectively one cable.

155
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:09,247
Speaker 0: to rule them all.

156
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:19,023
Speaker 1: a lot of people are going to end up plugging in a USB device into perhaps a computer that only has thunderbolt or a thunderbolt device into like a PC that only has USB.

157
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:23,642
Speaker 0: there will not be computers that do not have USB for a long time.

158
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:28,842
Speaker 0: there might be ones that don't have thunderbolts like no go try to build a PC with thunderbolt.

159
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,690
Speaker 0: you're not going to be able to right see by a PC.

160
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:41,011
Speaker 1: it's going to have a USB C port with USB 3.1. you'll buy some thunderbolt device and plug it in and it'll be like uh what there's actually a good reason why that's probably not going to happen.

161
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:45,004
Speaker 0: so thunderbolt is way expensive to implement.

162
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:51,361
Speaker 0: devices that use thunderbolt 3 are going to be pretty expensive and specialized things.

163
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:58,824
Speaker 0: so pretty much people who don't know better are going to end up buying USB stuff and plugging it into USB.

164
00:10:59,226 --> 00:10:59,989
Speaker 0: I can't imagine.

165
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:05,152
Speaker 0: many people will buy thunderbolt things and try to plug them into devices that don't support thunderbolt.

166
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:06,094
Speaker 1: that could happen.

167
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:10,706
Speaker 0: but thunderbolt 3 supports dual 4k displays.

168
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:17,403
Speaker 0: yeah 40 gigabits per second 100 watts of power bi-directional.

169
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:22,356
Speaker 0: so you could have a computer charging a thing or a thing charging a laptop.

170
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,687
Speaker 0: theoretically same cable same port right.

171
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:31,026
Speaker 1: so this is made by apple and of course apple just loves external things connected with cables.

172
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,476
Speaker 1: they hate opening a computer and putting stuff in.

173
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:34,560
Speaker 1: they think it's more.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,866
Speaker 1: you know the standalone device is beautiful but then in actual use it gets bundled in a mess of wires.

175
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,373
Speaker 1: is you got to plug it into everything?

176
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:45,609
Speaker 1: whereas a pc it's like okay I'm a little bit ugly but you know what.

177
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,961
Speaker 1: I don't get any uglier because you put everything inside me.

178
00:11:48,564 --> 00:12:01,878
Speaker 0: well we're kind of past that though because a modern computer like if you have a workstation you're gonna have a bunch of ssd's inside of it and then you connect to a san or a daz or a naz for all your big time storage and then like mouse keyboard

179
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,402
Speaker 1: what's a daz

180
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:04,866
Speaker 0: desktop attached storage?

181
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,816
Speaker 0: okay the difference it's like the difference between.

182
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:14,126
Speaker 0: yeah if you get a drobo with thunderbolt the idea is you plug it into your computer and it's a big external hard drive.

183
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:15,312
Speaker 0: yeah it's a big external hard drive.

184
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:15,977
Speaker 0: that's super fast.

185
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:17,124
Speaker 0: you can like edit video off.

186
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:20,360
Speaker 1: you can't share it with anyone unless you use your computer's sharing exactly.

187
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:25,220
Speaker 0: but thunderbolt the thing is this is really intel's thing and you know apple is irrelevant.

188
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:31,722
Speaker 0: the important part is this is going to be a standard for pcs and for pretty much everything going down the road.

189
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:46,786
Speaker 0: so we're finally standardizing on a pretty good cable and a pretty good set of formats and my only concern is whether or not pro audio hardware is gonna catch up anytime soon and give it enough time.

190
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:49,775
Speaker 1: I think you know I can see this kind of cable.

191
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:50,798
Speaker 1: only be.

192
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,744
Speaker 1: this is like sort of like the.

193
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:56,478
Speaker 1: I don't want to say it's the blu-ray but it's like the DVD of cables right.

194
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:57,161
Speaker 0: it's the last cable.

195
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:01,901
Speaker 1: there will be another cable after it that some people will use but this will be the last cable.

196
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:05,094
Speaker 1: wireless stuff will replace this cable right.

197
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:07,202
Speaker 1: wireless charging is actually somewhat there.

198
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:08,970
Speaker 1: now you can charge small batteries with it.

199
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:14,387
Speaker 0: yeah listen remember this cable also is not going to replace long-haul cables.

200
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,414
Speaker 0: that's gonna be fiber and stuff.

201
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:19,288
Speaker 1: we're talking about locals you know serial device connections right.

202
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:21,235
Speaker 1: this is gonna be the lat the DVD of cables.

203
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:31,108
Speaker 1: wireless will take over afterwards the same way that digital is replaced physical media yep and so eventually all devices that still have cables are gonna.

204
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:35,223
Speaker 1: that are consumer things will be using this kind phones everything.

205
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,562
Speaker 0: so if you're gonna buy if you're thinking so rim you're talking about build new computers.

206
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,952
Speaker 0: should I think about this when building a new computer?

207
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:46,746
Speaker 0: fuck no Thunderbolt 3 is not gonna be in a computer you buy anytime soon.

208
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:51,828
Speaker 1: if you buy a Mac today it'll have it yeah but if you buy the the trash cans it was Nicky geek nights.

209
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,998
Speaker 0: if you want a performance desktop you're gonna buy a PC sure.

210
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:07,849
Speaker 0: so my advice to you if you want to be forward compatible in regard to this is to one stock up on cards that will do firewire like a PCI.

211
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,998
Speaker 0: what II 1x card that'll do firewire?

212
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,024
Speaker 0: find one they're like 20 bucks.

213
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,351
Speaker 0: that works with all your firewire shit.

214
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:20,950
Speaker 0: buy four or five of them because they're cheap and hoard them because firewire is dead.

215
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,304
Speaker 1: and then the next computer you buy does not have a PCI Express slot.

216
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,075
Speaker 0: yes it will because PCI Express has continued forever.

217
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:29,484
Speaker 0: we'll talk about them in the other bed.

218
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,752
Speaker 0: you know what the current PCI Express is.

219
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:33,878
Speaker 0: are like X 32?

220
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:45,249
Speaker 0: no it's still like 16. is the same as it was in 2008. okay except there's 2.0 and 3.0. so there's the 16 16 4 versus the 16 or dual 8 mm-hmm and I'll talk about it.

221
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:47,336
Speaker 0: the main bit whatever my computer's way obsolete.

222
00:14:47,979 --> 00:15:00,117
Speaker 0: but do that and make sure whatever motherboard you get if you buy a new computer has two PCI X 16 slots for your video card and maybe two video cards maybe two you don't need to be okay.

223
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:12,892
Speaker 0: yeah it's a good way to be forward compatible but make sure you've got a PCI X for slot for X because that is the slot you'll need at minimum to buy a card to plug in.

224
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:20,875
Speaker 0: that will give you Thunderbolt ports in Thunderbolt 3 when that or USB 3.1 ports oh yeah USB 3.1 could go there too.

225
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:23,201
Speaker 0: but anyway yeah.

226
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,688
Speaker 0: but PCI Express the 4x slot.

227
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,892
Speaker 0: make sure you got one of those.

228
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,701
Speaker 0: I guess you could use the 16 slot.

229
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,424
Speaker 0: I guess that would work.

230
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,353
Speaker 0: maybe I'm not really an expert on that.

231
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:34,082
Speaker 1: so why no tech news?

232
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,772
Speaker 1: to speak of that you can tell because rim didn't do tech news either.

233
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,063
Speaker 0: there's tons of tech news you just don't give a shit about.

234
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:39,988
Speaker 0: it is the worst.

235
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:42,235
Speaker 1: if we had to do tech news roundup today we would be so fucked.

236
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:45,122
Speaker 0: the Supreme Court just ruled that they're gonna.

237
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:49,654
Speaker 0: that's a ruling.

238
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,641
Speaker 0: they said their ruling was.

239
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:56,601
Speaker 0: they said they hear the case and then they let the lower court's decision stand meaning you can't.

240
00:15:57,063 --> 00:16:01,418
Speaker 1: I thought they denied the written said we're not listening they the lower court's ruling stance.

241
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,250
Speaker 0: uh-huh the lower court's ruling was complicated.

242
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:11,369
Speaker 0: it was basically that the API's and all that stuff could be copyrighted can be copyrighted.

243
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,198
Speaker 1: you can still use them cuz fair use?

244
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:24,630
Speaker 0: no that there is an argument to be made that Google specific use may have been fair use and there is a separate court case to be had for that.

245
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,613
Speaker 1: well that's the important one.

246
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:30,267
Speaker 0: the problem is I really should have ruled the other way.

247
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,733
Speaker 1: well yeah that would have been much better.

248
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,481
Speaker 0: is the road we're going at?

249
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,510
Speaker 1: the end of the road is a dark road.

250
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:40,565
Speaker 0: however Swift might be the way to get out of that dark road down the road.

251
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:40,986
Speaker 1: whatever.

252
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,993
Speaker 1: alright that's news.

253
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:47,573
Speaker 1: so since there's no tech news I want to talk about a tech thing that I've purchased and used recently.

254
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,400
Speaker 1: who we found out about this thing?

255
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,288
Speaker 1: thanks to our friend Alan who works at YouTube.

256
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:54,659
Speaker 1: he told us about the cerebral live wedge.

257
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,790
Speaker 1: the cerebral live wedge is a thing that is very expensive.

258
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,055
Speaker 1: it's like a thousand dollars.

259
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:02,069
Speaker 1: you might be learning like whoa stop talking about how rich you are.

260
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:02,591
Speaker 1: it's like look.

261
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,964
Speaker 1: I was very hesitant to purchase this thousand dollar device.

262
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:09,155
Speaker 0: I almost bought it and then Scott messaged me and said yeah I bought one.

263
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:10,920
Speaker 1: so whatever.

264
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:15,935
Speaker 0: well I'll put it this way this is a tenth the cost of a tricaster.

265
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:20,667
Speaker 0: yes which is the what we want but we're not going to buy exactly.

266
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:21,991
Speaker 1: you think about it that way.

267
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,457
Speaker 1: yeah right it's like.

268
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,183
Speaker 1: my camera is $1,700.

269
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:26,689
Speaker 1: you can get it for less than that now.

270
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:27,771
Speaker 1: but I bought it was brand new.

271
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,901
Speaker 1: it's a 4k like ultra amazing video camera.

272
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:35,798
Speaker 1: but you know what the red camera is like tens of thousands of dollars.

273
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,105
Speaker 1: it's like well that's a good deal.

274
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:38,230
Speaker 1: then right it's like exactly.

275
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,957
Speaker 1: those are the best thing if you can afford it.

276
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,752
Speaker 1: the best things to buy are those things that are still expensive.

277
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:53,060
Speaker 1: but I have like amazing features that approach the levels of the ridiculously professionally expensive things but aren't quite there.

278
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,425
Speaker 1: and that is what the live wedge is.

279
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:55,128
Speaker 0: so it's.

280
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,876
Speaker 0: if there's a it's that edge between.

281
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:58,041
Speaker 0: no because we talk about this a lot.

282
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:00,492
Speaker 0: there's consumer stuff like a Sony camcorder.

283
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,134
Speaker 0: you just buy.

284
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:02,278
Speaker 1: yeah it best buy.

285
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:08,597
Speaker 0: yeah there's pro stuff like this is a studio camera cost tens of thousands of dollars.

286
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:11,649
Speaker 0: it doesn't come with any lenses or the power supply.

287
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:13,274
Speaker 1: it has this gigantic lens.

288
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:15,442
Speaker 1: a guy has to sit on a truck with it.

289
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:20,858
Speaker 0: next to the football stadium there's pro sumer which is kind of the level of.

290
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:26,956
Speaker 0: I have a weird use case that normal people don't care about but I do not need what.

291
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:38,458
Speaker 0: like George Miller used to film Mad Max I bought the more expensive GoPro instead of the cheap one exactly like I think the line with some accessories for my surfing video the line between consumer and pro sumer is.

292
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:44,604
Speaker 0: I have a use case that consumers stuff can't handle like for example for live streaming which is what Scott's about to talk about with the live wedge.

293
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:49,142
Speaker 0: if you're a consumer then you're probably just gonna buy.

294
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:55,427
Speaker 1: you can use a webcam yeah or you're just gonna use some software you're gonna use like X split maybe you're probably just OBS.

295
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,030
Speaker 0: it'll all just work.

296
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,471
Speaker 0: fine.

297
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,977
Speaker 1: if you're more serious you'll buy it.

298
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:58,679
Speaker 1: the Elgato.

299
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:09,740
Speaker 0: yep the Elgato is not a professional piece of equipment no but it edges into that pro sumer territory because it's a dedicated piece of expensive hardware that solves a

300
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,824
Speaker 1: hundred and something but yeah

301
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:15,621
Speaker 0: and it solves some problems that a lot of people who do in live streams do not have

302
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,467
Speaker 1: on a live stream my xbox yep

303
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:30,852
Speaker 0: or I want to live stream a device with a separate device like I want to live stream my computer with a different computer doing the actual streaming possibly with multiple cameras or audio or whatever.

304
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:38,300
Speaker 0: I have a complicated use case the live which is kind of like it's it's in that Twilight Zone between prosumer and professional.

305
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,838
Speaker 1: so it's made by some weird Japanese company called cerebo that no one ever heard of and the way it works is.

306
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:44,667
Speaker 1: it's really quite small.

307
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:50,543
Speaker 1: you didn't realize how small it is until you get it and on the back are six HDMI ports.

308
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:53,572
Speaker 1: four of them are inputs one two three and four.

309
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,439
Speaker 1: yeah one of them is the output.

310
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:03,710
Speaker 1: that one you plug into a TV and you'll basically see what is being streamed in real time and the other one is the preview and that shows you on the TV.

311
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,473
Speaker 1: if you plug it in.

312
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:10,838
Speaker 1: basically it cuts your TV into four boxes like goldeneye and you can see the four inputs right and what they are.

313
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,787
Speaker 1: so you can like you have two TVs.

314
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:20,455
Speaker 1: you can sort of have the actual output and the four boxes and then you can sort of switch between the four inputs like it's a real TV show like you know.

315
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:25,914
Speaker 1: camera one is you know rims face and camera two is Scott's face and input three is.

316
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:30,186
Speaker 1: you know the board game they're playing and input four is like.

317
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:34,962
Speaker 1: you know the logo geek nice logo and you switch between the four like it's actual TV.

318
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:38,072
Speaker 1: yep it can also do picture in picture.

319
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:54,595
Speaker 1: so we could put like the night's logo and a little square in the corner and like do like the nightly news does on TV where it's like it appears and disappears and changes pictures right and to populate that you could say have a laptop with it with the logo full screen with an HDMI output going into output.

320
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,622
Speaker 1: you know input number four.

321
00:20:56,642 --> 00:21:07,274
Speaker 1: or you can just put a bunch of JPEGs or movie files onto an SD card put the SD card into the live wedge and use any of those images or videos as a camera.

322
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:10,947
Speaker 1: so like if you have a recorded video you can make that right.

323
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,539
Speaker 1: you can like do a whole fucking nightly news show with this thing.

324
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,183
Speaker 1: it's ridiculous.

325
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:14,484
Speaker 1: yeah.

326
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:18,202
Speaker 0: now the other important thing is that it has all those sort of features for command and control.

327
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:21,395
Speaker 0: like you can also have a separate from all that audio channel.

328
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:26,031
Speaker 1: yep there's a red and white RCA audio input that is separate from all the other.

329
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:34,945
Speaker 1: you know you still get audio inputs on the four HDMI eyes but there's a separate audio input so you can have like just commentary while you switch between different views.

330
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:44,100
Speaker 1: so think about this like here's the example you're watching a karate tournament and there's four mats where people are fighting and you're the commentator and you can.

331
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:46,069
Speaker 1: you know you see the fight starting on Matt too.

332
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,675
Speaker 1: so you push the second camera.

333
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,642
Speaker 1: you start talking that fight ends.

334
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:51,047
Speaker 1: you switch to Matt three.

335
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:53,135
Speaker 1: you know that kind of you set it up to where.

336
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:56,951
Speaker 1: like the audio you got four cameras with four HDMI cables coming in.

337
00:21:56,971 --> 00:22:01,149
Speaker 0: yep so the audio from each of the four cameras will come in whichever one you're looking at.

338
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:03,118
Speaker 0: maybe at like half volume or quarter volume.

339
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:03,420
Speaker 0: you can.

340
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,846
Speaker 1: it doesn't mix or you can touch it.

341
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:08,744
Speaker 0: and then at full volume is you talking no matter what you talking through the mixer.

342
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,632
Speaker 0: that's then connected to the live wedge.

343
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:13,463
Speaker 1: yep now how do you control this live wedge?

344
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:16,273
Speaker 1: on the surface of the live wage is a little LCD screen.

345
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:16,715
Speaker 1: it's not.

346
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,842
Speaker 1: it's like a really crappy LCD screen.

347
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:27,400
Speaker 1: you can control it a lot through that screen surprisingly because there's a big wheel with a button in the middle like an old iPod on the right and you can use that to work with the interface.

348
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:32,382
Speaker 1: there's also four buttons underneath the screen that let you switch between the four cameras.

349
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:35,576
Speaker 1: it doesn't even have an on/off switch just to plug it in to turn it on.

350
00:22:35,596 --> 00:22:36,621
Speaker 1: it's kind of ridiculous.

351
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:39,011
Speaker 1: I guess it can also record to the SD card.

352
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:39,914
Speaker 1: I guess it's worth mentioning.

353
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:43,889
Speaker 1: but the most important thing is that it has an Ethernet port.

354
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:46,299
Speaker 1: so you plug it straight into the internet.

355
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:46,701
Speaker 1: that's right.

356
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:49,613
Speaker 1: you don't need the Elgato needs a computer to do streaming.

357
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:52,645
Speaker 1: you have to plug the Elgato with USB into a real computer.

358
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,352
Speaker 1: that then does the streaming part.

359
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:57,787
Speaker 1: with software the Elgato does all the streaming on its own.

360
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,353
Speaker 1: it is a standalone streaming device.

361
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:00,497
Speaker 1: it requires no computer.

362
00:23:00,637 --> 00:23:04,271
Speaker 1: you can have the live wedge a camera internet and you're good.

363
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,457
Speaker 1: no computers necessary no laptop so nothing.

364
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:11,672
Speaker 1: so to control it what you actually do is use your iPad.

365
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:14,041
Speaker 1: I think it's iPad only there might.

366
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:15,668
Speaker 1: I don't know if this iPhone software.

367
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:16,631
Speaker 1: I think it's iPad only.

368
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:28,906
Speaker 1: you can either a plug the live wedge into the internet with Ethernet and then connect to the live wedge with Wi-Fi the live wedge you tell it to become a Wi-Fi access point.

369
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:35,132
Speaker 1: you connect your iPad directly to the live wedge and then open up the live wedge app and now you can control it with the iPad.

370
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:49,640
Speaker 1: or you can if you have really good Wi-Fi have the live wedge connect to the internet with Wi-Fi and then as long as you connect your iPad to the same network by Wi-Fi it will see the live wedge on the network and connect to it with the app.

371
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:53,758
Speaker 0: so now you have an awesome tiny screen just to control all this stuff live on the screen.

372
00:23:54,139 --> 00:24:04,393
Speaker 1: on the iPad you can control everything the picture and picture which camera mix the audio and the settings check the YouTube check the new stream check whatever's.

373
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,601
Speaker 1: you can do everything in the iPad app.

374
00:24:07,464 --> 00:24:15,716
Speaker 1: it's a little bit finicky in the user interface but it's since they got some firmware updates and some app updates it is now stable like there's no crashy bits or anything.

375
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:17,984
Speaker 1: it's just a little finicky interface wise.

376
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:23,523
Speaker 1: it also does some other fancy shit like green screen and chroma key type stuff.

377
00:24:24,024 --> 00:24:26,894
Speaker 1: you can resize the picture in picture and move it around.

378
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:34,501
Speaker 1: it does transitions like when you switch from camera one to two you can do a cut or a fade or a wipe or all kinds.

379
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:37,932
Speaker 1: that right it does all this kind of stuff you don't realize that it can do.

380
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:42,270
Speaker 0: and now yeah you can do that stuff in post-production if you're making like a big video.

381
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,634
Speaker 1: this is live stream.

382
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,401
Speaker 1: it does it right real time.

383
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:46,565
Speaker 0: so think about the two uses.

384
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:57,660
Speaker 0: either we can live stream complicated events with high production values or we can record things like we normally do but we can do all most of the post-production live.

385
00:24:58,002 --> 00:25:02,096
Speaker 0: so like the Daily Show you upload the video that night instead of a week later.

386
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:09,298
Speaker 1: there's only one flaw that I can find with the live wedge and that is it doesn't actually stream in 1080p.

387
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,608
Speaker 1: it streams in 720p max because it's not like.

388
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:23,313
Speaker 1: it has some crazy ridiculous CPU in there you know with a whole ton of RAM and a video card to process MPEG videos right which in a way is fun because then the thing is people don't even notice like they're watching.

389
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:25,723
Speaker 1: your stream like 720p looks fucking great.

390
00:25:26,044 --> 00:25:27,611
Speaker 1: yeah especially if your input is good.

391
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:30,724
Speaker 1: if your input is high quality the output is gonna be high quality.

392
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:34,700
Speaker 0: right though I gotta say cuz we uploaded our first 4k video to YouTube.

393
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,266
Speaker 1: 4k looks really good.

394
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:36,929
Speaker 0: so you're lucky.

395
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,514
Speaker 1: but you're lucky if your computer can play it.

396
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:38,916
Speaker 0: yeah.

397
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:42,608
Speaker 0: so like I cannot display 4k so I have a 4k screen.

398
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:48,183
Speaker 0: no so to test it I opened it in VLC and I had it show one-to-one.

399
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:55,748
Speaker 0: so despite my two monitors it's like this huge image like way I can only see a part of the image at a time at one-to-one pixel.

400
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:58,316
Speaker 0: yeah let me tell you it looks amazing.

401
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:04,314
Speaker 0: yeah even with like the low shitty light and you're just like carrying the camera around.

402
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:16,114
Speaker 1: for example with my camera I could have my camera record in 4k while outputting to the stream so that way we could live stream and then later on take the recorded video from the one camera right.

403
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:20,288
Speaker 0: so think about this with Premiere and like post-processing.

404
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:21,994
Speaker 0: here's an amazing workflow.

405
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:23,278
Speaker 0: you run the LiveWedge.

406
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,598
Speaker 0: all the cameras are recording to their own individual SD cards mm-hmm audio and video.

407
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,456
Speaker 0: our Marantz is recording audio to his compact flash because it's ancient and uses compact flash.

408
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,990
Speaker 0: the mixer is also sending the audio you know to the LiveWedge.

409
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:42,269
Speaker 0: the LiveWedge is recording a 720p video of the final mix all the cuts and everything.

410
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,696
Speaker 1: I don't really I mean LiveWedge.

411
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:46,347
Speaker 1: I said it can record and it can but I'm not a big fan of.

412
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,231
Speaker 0: no no here's what you do.

413
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:54,157
Speaker 0: so it's recording the actual mix with all the transitions that for the synchronizing and yeah and it's live streaming.

414
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:58,209
Speaker 0: then after the event Scott just gives me all the SD cards.

415
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,060
Speaker 1: you're gonna have to put a really big SD card in that in that live way.

416
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,573
Speaker 0: yeah yeah but I dump all the SD cards onto my computer.

417
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:21,600
Speaker 0: I drag them all into Premiere and I say sync all this shit up and then I just replace all the video clips from the 720p live stream version with the 4k clips from all the cameras and have the ultra high quality version to upload.

418
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:22,504
Speaker 1: you could do that.

419
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,373
Speaker 1: yes I've tested various things with the LiveWedge.

420
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:33,642
Speaker 1: I tested a like output from HDMI on my ex like a not my Xbox but like you know my HD PC right into the LiveWedge totally worked.

421
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:35,230
Speaker 1: laptop right into LiveWedge totally works.

422
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,344
Speaker 1: GoPro HDMI cable into the LiveWedge totally worked right.

423
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:44,022
Speaker 1: the only time I had a problem was when I had like an HDMI splitter and put one half of it into the.

424
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:44,986
Speaker 1: you didn't really like.

425
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:47,256
Speaker 0: that's the one thing the Elgato is useful for.

426
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:51,997
Speaker 0: if you want to live stream a game on a TV but you're playing that game while you live stream it.

427
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:52,780
Speaker 1: yeah that's the thing.

428
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:54,388
Speaker 1: is that the the one feet.

429
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:54,790
Speaker 1: that's the thing.

430
00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:02,840
Speaker 1: the Elgato has an HDMI output with no delay on it so you can play a video game that's being live streamed but that HDMI pass through on the Elgato.

431
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,913
Speaker 1: if you try to do that with the LiveWedge is gonna be a delay.

432
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,940
Speaker 1: it's not gonna go well in your favor.

433
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:15,349
Speaker 1: you need the HDMI splitter but the HDMI splitter at least the one that I have the the LiveWedge did not like the output from that splitter.

434
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:15,871
Speaker 0: here's the problem.

435
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:19,965
Speaker 0: that is that the fault there is HDMI and it's bullshit.

436
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:20,929
Speaker 0: copyrighted protection.

437
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:29,146
Speaker 1: I don't know if it has to do with the kind of protection because I was using output from just my HD PC which is not HDCP but it's still the way HDMI was designed.

438
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:29,708
Speaker 1: I think it's just cuz.

439
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:36,193
Speaker 0: I have a cheapo splitter and if I bought a fancy splitter my HDMI is not designed to be split because that was an avenue of piracy.

440
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:37,116
Speaker 1: sure maybe?

441
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,740
Speaker 0: yeah that's one aspect to it.

442
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,221
Speaker 0: anyway.

443
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:53,691
Speaker 1: yeah if you do a lot of live streaming or if you have to do some fancy live streaming where multiple cameras switching in real time is a thing you're gonna want to help you out with you should consider buying or renting this LiveWedge deal.

444
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:55,819
Speaker 1: it's really small and portable.

445
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,713
Speaker 1: I don't recommend using it unless you are near a spot with.

446
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:03,434
Speaker 1: obviously you need to be near something with power but you can get power from like a big battery or something.

447
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:04,359
Speaker 1: it doesn't take a lot of power.

448
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:14,183
Speaker 1: you need to be near some wired internet or some ridiculously fast wireless internet unless you're using it or it won't be enough bandwidth to stream unless you're using it to record and then upload later.

449
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:15,689
Speaker 1: but that's the nicest part.

450
00:29:15,709 --> 00:29:18,961
Speaker 1: is that like it just sort of like really?

451
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:26,855
Speaker 1: you go like YouTube you make a new live event you go to the iPad app you see the event there you just push stream and you don't worry about any of these finicky settings or anything like.

452
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,602
Speaker 1: the interface is kind of clunky.

453
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:29,966
Speaker 1: it gets it right.

454
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:31,894
Speaker 1: it just streams and the stream.

455
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:40,767
Speaker 1: as long as the internet is good it just streams great and in fact even when the internet was bad it streamed as good as you could hope for in given the bad stuff stance.

456
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:49,685
Speaker 0: now also stay tuned because Scott's learning how to use this thing really well and we've like upgraded our lighting and like all our other equipment and like those microphones.

457
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,259
Speaker 0: the only reason we haven't been doing a lot of big content is we have one.

458
00:29:53,279 --> 00:30:01,147
Speaker 0: we don't have a studio so doing big video content means I literally destroy my entire living room for a full day or a full weekend and two.

459
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,721
Speaker 0: it's got to be crappy weather outside or we're not gonna do it.

460
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:11,527
Speaker 1: so yeah if you consider the cerebral live wedge or not they make some other products too but I don't know about those.

461
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:14,759
Speaker 0: the live wedge is the best tool that does that.

462
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,670
Speaker 0: unless you have tens of thousands of dollars to spend and

463
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,162
Speaker 1: you need if you really need 1080p's right maybe wait for the live wedge -

464
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:22,788
Speaker 0: yeah yeah

465
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:27,432
Speaker 1: but maybe I could just when that comes maybe I'll sell the live wedge one by the leverage - or may you see how much you

466
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,557
Speaker 0: keep the live wedge one?

467
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:33,518
Speaker 0: because a lot of times having a secondary device can be really really useful daddy to streams.

468
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:36,451
Speaker 0: well though like YouTube you can have your primary and secondary stream.

469
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:42,592
Speaker 0: so YouTube if your primary stream fails it'll just cut to the secondary stream seamlessly sure.

470
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:47,530
Speaker 0: so you can have the 720p backup stream going over like a different ISP or something.

471
00:30:47,710 --> 00:31:04,600
Speaker 0: maybe yeah anyway things of the day this is just some white kid who raps really really really fast and it's actually pretty impressive white kid.

472
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:10,246
Speaker 1: I mean that's somewhat impressive but you spend way too much time practicing that because you have anything better to do with your life.

473
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:12,275
Speaker 0: he seems to be doing a little bit.

474
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:12,616
Speaker 0: he's done.

475
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:17,395
Speaker 0: he's got a lot of those like Barker I don't know enough about terminology but he can.

476
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:22,716
Speaker 0: he is ad-libbing some of it and using those tricks to keep going even when he lost the thread anyway.

477
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:24,543
Speaker 0: but it just it's pretty impressive.

478
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:25,005
Speaker 0: I like this.

479
00:31:25,045 --> 00:31:28,939
Speaker 1: so there is an event every year known as the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

480
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,264
Speaker 1: it is a more like.

481
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:33,554
Speaker 1: it's sort of like Otakon only replace anime with cars.

482
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:35,820
Speaker 1: that's you can consider it like that sort of right.

483
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:43,963
Speaker 1: and at the Goodwood Festival of Speed this year recently someone broke there.

484
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:46,531
Speaker 1: this is particular track and you know where it goes.

485
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:48,038
Speaker 1: up a hill it's like this little uphill run.

486
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:51,733
Speaker 1: it's about a mile long and they race various things up this hill.

487
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:57,012
Speaker 1: and one of the things that someone raced up the hill this year was a Nissan Juke.

488
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:02,733
Speaker 1: and they raced the Nissan Juke up the hill and to see what time they could get to try to break the record.

489
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:06,228
Speaker 1: it's like well how could you break the record of Nissan Juke?

490
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:08,438
Speaker 1: well it wasn't just the record for fastest up the hill.

491
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:17,405
Speaker 1: that record was set in this other video that I'll also link by an f1 car in 1999 when they actually had real engines 41 seconds.

492
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:30,899
Speaker 1: yeah right it's a two-minute record set for going up the hill on two wheels and not a bicycle or a motorcycle a Nissan Juke which has four wheels but they only use two of them.

493
00:32:31,822 --> 00:32:37,958
Speaker 0: the best part of the video is the advertising banner on the bottom of the car.

494
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:40,144
Speaker 1: that is very nice.

495
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:42,189
Speaker 0: it's kind of amazing.

496
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:52,113
Speaker 1: this guy who does this is apparently like one of the world's best stunt drivers who does like shows and all this kind of cool stuff like he'll get out of the car and get back into it and do all sorts of ridiculous shit.

497
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:58,034
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna try to find that guy's name and search for him on YouTube and see what kind of awesome shit he's done.

498
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,041
Speaker 1: you know maybe I'll be a fan of his.

499
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,342
Speaker 1: huh.

500
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,433
Speaker 0: in the moment we have uploaded a ton of videos.

501
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:10,454
Speaker 0: the most recent one is our 4k video walkthrough of the Pac South the first Pac South Expo Hall.

502
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,059
Speaker 1: I watched this video.

503
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,083
Speaker 1: it actually wasn't bad.

504
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:15,772
Speaker 0: yeah like it is twice as good as the first time.

505
00:33:15,812 --> 00:33:17,280
Speaker 0: we attempted that we learned a lot.

506
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,325
Speaker 1: this video is not awful.

507
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,250
Speaker 1: a little bit of shakiness.

508
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:20,775
Speaker 0: yeah I tried.

509
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,139
Speaker 0: I tried to use a lot of filters.

510
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,286
Speaker 0: see if I could like get rid of the shakiness.

511
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:27,739
Speaker 0: technology is not quite there yet I'll bring them up did.

512
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,055
Speaker 1: is that when I forgot the monopod I yeah I think so I won't forget it next time.

513
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:37,277
Speaker 0: yeah but stay tuned we're getting better at that crap but I think we're a lot better at doing that sort of.

514
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:41,437
Speaker 1: you want to buy me this much fancier monopod that has a Manfrotto clip on the top.

515
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:43,445
Speaker 0: you might be better off buying that second Marantz.

516
00:33:43,706 --> 00:33:45,011
Speaker 1: I'm gonna keep using my $20 monopod.

517
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,002
Speaker 0: but uh yeah the videos.

518
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:50,246
Speaker 0: actually the thing is what.

519
00:33:50,306 --> 00:34:00,970
Speaker 0: it was so long ago that when I watched it to edit the video together because we walked through the expo hall for like three hours and I cut this thing down to like 20 something minutes of just the interesting things we saw.

520
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:05,171
Speaker 0: there's a lot of interesting games that I forgot about that I need to go back and see if they came out.

521
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,482
Speaker 1: yet there were a lot of interesting games.

522
00:34:07,582 --> 00:34:09,791
Speaker 1: but when I saw them I'm like yeah I don't need to play this.

523
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:13,060
Speaker 0: yeah yeah except video ball.

524
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,324
Speaker 0: I just want video ball.

525
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,752
Speaker 0: I want video ball more than I want most things.

526
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:25,696
Speaker 0: I kind of wanted to know also one of the games that we were really excited about that it was a free space shooter that looked just like way.

527
00:34:26,076 --> 00:34:28,221
Speaker 0: pro apparently it's an MMO.

528
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:46,389
Speaker 0: okay so I don't know that could be good if it actually relies on skill cuz I'm pretty good at flying a spaceship and shooting people but if it requires leveling up but anyway we'll see about that.

529
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,853
Speaker 0: I think elite dangerous was the game.

530
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:54,299
Speaker 1: oh that's like famous because like the the flying like super matters and so I've heard a lot of crazy shit about that.

531
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:56,308
Speaker 0: well we watched the guy at PAX and that was legit.

532
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,618
Speaker 0: free space shooter like.

533
00:34:58,658 --> 00:34:59,621
Speaker 1: is that the one we're like?

534
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:01,408
Speaker 1: you gotta like even docking.

535
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:04,982
Speaker 1: you have to manually control the ship and like shit is crazy in that game.

536
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:07,170
Speaker 1: that's the kind of thing we're like.

537
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,913
Speaker 1: that's your whole life.

538
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,666
Speaker 1: if you do that yeah you should maybe investigate that.

539
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:12,313
Speaker 1: that's your might be your cuz I?

540
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,236
Speaker 0: yeah maybe.

541
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:20,343
Speaker 0: maybe I've heard some things but yeah otherwise the booklet book is the first book of I guess the eight Wheel of Time books are there.

542
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:21,066
Speaker 1: eight are there.

543
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:22,030
Speaker 0: I don't know how many there are.

544
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:24,679
Speaker 1: there's a called the eye of the world.

545
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:28,772
Speaker 0: it's a fantasy story about some fancy people doing fantasy stuff.

546
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:30,816
Speaker 0: wizards candidates.

547
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:35,186
Speaker 0: yeah magics gender-based magic private ventures.

548
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:43,384
Speaker 1: yeah swords even shield the heron blade horses and armor proper nouns.

549
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:46,893
Speaker 0: he's not a fighter he's a warder evil dude.

550
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:48,938
Speaker 0: she's not a wizard or a maid.

551
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:52,467
Speaker 1: she's like scary names in made-up languages.

552
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:55,657
Speaker 0: that guy with the fucking kind of deserved it.

553
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:56,801
Speaker 0: did you get that?

554
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:57,584
Speaker 0: did you read further?

555
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:58,488
Speaker 1: no I watched.

556
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:02,962
Speaker 0: or a Mona guitar instead or I like or they're not in the same genre.

557
00:36:02,982 --> 00:36:03,584
Speaker 0: they don't compete.

558
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:06,453
Speaker 1: but yeah they could be for time.

559
00:36:06,473 --> 00:36:07,415
Speaker 0: that is true.

560
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:12,629
Speaker 0: otherwise Connecticut is coming up in two weeks super soon.

561
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:14,857
Speaker 0: Hartford Connecticut the weekend of July 9th.

562
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:21,161
Speaker 1: if you are a nerd and listening to this and you are within distance of Hartford Connecticut you have no excuse.

563
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:25,998
Speaker 1: unless something more important is happening in your life you should be at Connecticut.

564
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,824
Speaker 1: oh man it's gonna be amazing.

565
00:36:27,844 --> 00:36:28,707
Speaker 0: yeah it is.

566
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:30,613
Speaker 1: it is not the biggest convention.

567
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:40,283
Speaker 1: it is not the best convention but it is the best convention per capita that I know of in terms of the amount of awesomeness per person.

568
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,290
Speaker 1: I know of no convention that beats.

569
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:50,010
Speaker 0: yeah like Connecticut is a better gaming con than any non packs non magfest gaming con in America.

570
00:36:50,411 --> 00:37:00,102
Speaker 1: I mean maybe there's like a VGG con or whatever but it's like those cons that are more are full on 100% gaming like Gen Con and origins.

571
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:02,270
Speaker 1: like they got issues that Connecticut do not have.

572
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:08,647
Speaker 1: right you know panels how many we might have more panels I think than one year.

573
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:12,381
Speaker 1: we had conventions one year when we had the biggest when we had not.

574
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:13,827
Speaker 0: well we had 11 panel rooms.

575
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:17,640
Speaker 0: we've cut back a little bit and like we've spaced our we've paced ourselves a little more.

576
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:18,884
Speaker 0: we had like 288 panels right.

577
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:33,732
Speaker 1: and also if you consider all all geeky conventions right from the top of Maine going south it's pretty much anime Boston one Connecticut - there's no other big convention out in that geographic area.

578
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,179
Speaker 1: right what next?

579
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:36,485
Speaker 1: what's the next convention after that?

580
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,955
Speaker 1: New York Comic Con is the next one after that geographically.

581
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:42,710
Speaker 1: so why the hell would you miss Connecticut if you are in that area?

582
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:43,894
Speaker 1: seriously?

583
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,178
Speaker 0: yeah Connecticut is on the.

584
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:46,483
Speaker 1: where else are you gonna go like the?

585
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:51,722
Speaker 1: the sad you know washed up pro wrestler next to the sports card table place.

586
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:56,660
Speaker 0: we're not just saying this because we run the entire like panels and workshops special events.

587
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:59,050
Speaker 1: I would go to Connecticut if I was not.

588
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:02,968
Speaker 1: I might even just quit Connecticut to save myself some work but still go to it and enjoy it.

589
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:14,903
Speaker 0: there are the number of cons we would go to not being guests and not being in charge less than less than we have friends that come to Connecticut and work with us on staff.

590
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:22,411
Speaker 1: but we also have many friends who go to Connecticut and pay money for badges and play games the whole time but also go to some panels.

591
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:27,625
Speaker 0: yeah I like we're the con is legit it's really legit.

592
00:38:27,886 --> 00:38:31,657
Speaker 1: yeah go listen to some really old episode we did about an early Connecticut on to laugh.

593
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:34,367
Speaker 0: yeah in fact a good time.

594
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:37,036
Speaker 1: listen to geek nights 2006 Connecticut.

595
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:40,550
Speaker 0: the only problem with Connecticut is the problem that most con have.

596
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:42,978
Speaker 0: there is just no food over there.

597
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:46,730
Speaker 1: you can eat the Convention Center ice cream for whatever it costs.

598
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:51,987
Speaker 0: oh my god there was a year where I ate open late one day I think on Friday.

599
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,232
Speaker 0: that was the year back before we.

600
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:59,636
Speaker 1: if you approach Connecticut from the Albany direction you can go to the bells and if you approach from the south you can get it to.

601
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:01,042
Speaker 1: Bell is in Milford Connecticut.

602
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:05,056
Speaker 1: don't approach from the east just bring food with you.

603
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:08,505
Speaker 0: yeah no drive past to Milford by.

604
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:13,034
Speaker 1: that's a way south it's like not.

605
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:17,790
Speaker 0: I would detour up to an hour to get to Bell but meanwhile you're taking a bus or a train.

606
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,055
Speaker 0: take an Amtrak because fuck that.

607
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,681
Speaker 1: no it doesn't stop at the Bell's does it?

608
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:21,183
Speaker 0: no?

609
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:29,637
Speaker 0: but uh multiple years in a row I've been stuck in ridiculous traffic on a bus or in a car trying to get home from Connecticut to New York.

610
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,506
Speaker 1: so we'll find a way around this problem.

611
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:33,489
Speaker 0: just take the Amtrak.

612
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:34,973
Speaker 0: it's like 40 bucks each way.

613
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:42,791
Speaker 1: just go take a train the Metro North train oh and then take a car from my mom's house.

614
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,418
Speaker 0: oh you know we were debating.

615
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:55,117
Speaker 0: actually cuz remember that one year you me Emily and Judith took the train and then we took the car from your parents house and hung out there like we ate food even and we stopped on the way home.

616
00:39:55,177 --> 00:39:56,020
Speaker 0: it was good time.

617
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,326
Speaker 0: hmm yeah that could be good.

618
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:01,978
Speaker 1: anyway I can like and then I can go to develop.

619
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,166
Speaker 0: you can go to but if you should I?

620
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:07,017
Speaker 1: should I take a picture there and that and not bring you a sandwich?

621
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:08,502
Speaker 1: should I bring you a sandwich?

622
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:09,326
Speaker 0: I'll pay you.

623
00:40:09,346 --> 00:40:20,510
Speaker 1: should I be like my uncle who showed up at the all-star game that we gave him tickets to in Boston with a sandwich that he got at the deli near his house in Queens but did not have a more than one sandwich?

624
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:23,096
Speaker 1: or should I be a nice person?

625
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,202
Speaker 0: you should get me a de Bella's.

626
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:31,944
Speaker 1: should I get you a de Bella's but perhaps not the one you asked for or perhaps just a small smell.

627
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:36,000
Speaker 0: the small would almost be the worst cuz that's just enough for me to enjoy it.

628
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:36,623
Speaker 1: maybe I'll get.

629
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:42,903
Speaker 1: I'll give you a small and then secretly give you a second small of a different kind.

630
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:45,511
Speaker 0: I can't think of any de Bella's saw that I wouldn't eat.

631
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:49,145
Speaker 0: I mean I will get you lettuce only I would eat that cuz that bread.

632
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:52,335
Speaker 1: I will get you lettuce on the bad bread choice.

633
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:54,701
Speaker 0: oh no no it's got to be the sesame.

634
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:57,368
Speaker 1: no see the plain bread.

635
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:58,471
Speaker 0: who gets the plain bread?

636
00:40:58,491 --> 00:40:59,755
Speaker 1: the plain bread with lettuce?

637
00:41:00,718 --> 00:41:05,211
Speaker 1: so are you even worse plain bread with just American cheese?

638
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:10,472
Speaker 0: in terms of the history of me buying computers cuz Scott I both posted the history of computers.

639
00:41:10,873 --> 00:41:16,125
Speaker 0: cuz as you said in 1994 rim got a 486 sx2.

640
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:18,671
Speaker 0: that was the first computer that was in my house.

641
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:28,574
Speaker 1: yeah I guess mine was 95 because I was 13 486 dx4 100 megahertz 4 megabytes of RAM later upgraded to 8 or even 16.

642
00:41:28,574 --> 00:41:31,444
Speaker 0: I forget mine had 4 and I upgraded it to a.

643
00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:32,909
Speaker 1: I had a 4x CD-ROM.

644
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:35,578
Speaker 1: I could install doom 2 like BAM.

645
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:35,999
Speaker 1: I didn't.

646
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,250
Speaker 1: if I ran out of space on my 700 and something megabyte hard drive.

647
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:44,091
Speaker 1: I just uninstalled doom 2 and install something else and then reinstall cuz it took like two seconds.

648
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,576
Speaker 1: I had a play games off.

649
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:46,881
Speaker 1: the CD-ROM is so fast.

650
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:55,062
Speaker 0: I had a 2x CD-ROM and more importantly cuz that's half as much X as I had to play doom 2 or doom.

651
00:41:55,082 --> 00:42:04,489
Speaker 0: I had to use a boot disk or hold f5 when I booted to go into minimal DOS mode loading no drivers manually loaded a mouse drive.

652
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:12,297
Speaker 1: I had the vastly superior PC DOS on this IBM computer that originally came with OS to warp that I later replaced Windows 95.

653
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,730
Speaker 0: Scott and I were like completely out of sync in terms of computers.

654
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,567
Speaker 0: at any given time one of us had a computer that left the other computer.

655
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:20,832
Speaker 0: the other one of ours computer.

656
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:25,086
Speaker 1: so far in the dust it was it seems like such a small difference right about a 486 50 vs.

657
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:27,373
Speaker 1: 486 100.

658
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:33,629
Speaker 0: it's like twice as fast to have a computer twice as fast as my current computer you can't.

659
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:40,853
Speaker 1: I was able to play mech warrior 2 on the full settings if I full installed which I could if I deleted a lot of stuff.

660
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:44,642
Speaker 0: so in 1997 I got a Pentium 200 megahertz.

661
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:51,157
Speaker 0: well that computer was a god tier computer you brought to RIT.

662
00:42:51,478 --> 00:42:55,246
Speaker 0: no so in 99 Scott got a Pentium 3.

663
00:42:55,246 --> 00:43:00,662
Speaker 1: oh yeah I bought that with the money I earned at working summer camp.

664
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:01,705
Speaker 0: the BX motherboard.

665
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,914
Speaker 1: that is that is the first computer that I built with my hands.

666
00:43:05,275 --> 00:43:11,771
Speaker 1: it had the BX chipset the most reliable motherboard chipset to ever exist.

667
00:43:12,052 --> 00:43:14,660
Speaker 1: that shit never blue-screened even one time.

668
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,882
Speaker 1: it booted at the first go and it even even when I stopped using that computer it still works just fine.

669
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:23,654
Speaker 1: if I could find it I bet it still works I think it might be my closet.

670
00:43:23,674 --> 00:43:29,615
Speaker 0: yeah maybe now it's interesting because there was a long plateau in the Pentium 3 era.

671
00:43:29,615 --> 00:43:34,771
Speaker 0: 400 450 500 megahertz like computers did not get faster very quickly for a while.

672
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:39,845
Speaker 0: nope and to go faster was expensive that Pentium 3 450.

673
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:43,294
Speaker 1: also when I bought it the day I bought it it came with.

674
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:44,357
Speaker 1: well I didn't come with.

675
00:43:44,397 --> 00:43:45,540
Speaker 1: I bought it with I built it.

676
00:43:46,102 --> 00:43:52,319
Speaker 1: the TNT - the TNT - by the way was the brand new video card at the time.

677
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,506
Speaker 1: oh how cute how cute.

678
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:56,773
Speaker 0: you bought a video card that opened GL.

679
00:43:56,813 --> 00:44:00,344
Speaker 0: you I had one of the first video cards that had opened GL.

680
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:03,635
Speaker 1: this was the first video card that was for reals.

681
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:10,159
Speaker 0: the other there were previous video cards like there was the voodoo - bullshit with the drivers that ever color gamut.

682
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,808
Speaker 1: but there was the TNT which was like sort of.

683
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:15,297
Speaker 1: this was the TNT - though that was like a major.

684
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:19,912
Speaker 1: that was like basically the first modern video card that had real power.

685
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,656
Speaker 1: was that AGP I could play?

686
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:39,306
Speaker 1: I could play you know all the modern games like the half-lives and the quakes and all those games at the full FPS choco mobile armor division all the late 90s early 2000s tribes - no I had those games I could play now.

687
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:46,850
Speaker 0: what's interesting is Scott bought that computer in 1999 and compared to the computer I had at that time they were like my computer.

688
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:48,394
Speaker 0: my computer was garbage about in 99.

689
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,479
Speaker 1: yeah not 92 no 99 but mine was 97. yep.

690
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:57,960
Speaker 0: so one year after Scott got that penny at two years rims computer was garbage.

691
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:10,116
Speaker 0: yes but one year after Scott's Pentium 3 AMD when I brought that Pentium 3 to RIT rim brought a new computer to RIT I brought an AMD k7 800 megahertz.

692
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:11,740
Speaker 0: fucking monster.

693
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:16,009
Speaker 0: that computer tower that computer a full tower was.

694
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:17,492
Speaker 1: I'll never forget the whole town.

695
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:18,916
Speaker 0: that thing was.

696
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:25,010
Speaker 0: it was so tall it weighed like 30 pounds like that thing.

697
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,375
Speaker 0: it wasn't even full.

698
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:28,041
Speaker 1: it just had a bunch of scuzzy shit in it.

699
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:34,869
Speaker 1: yeah I had a scuzzy easily been a mid tower even a mini tower but he just put so many drives in it and stuff like.

700
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:41,088
Speaker 0: yeah I had a raid I had a bunch of hard drives rated together I had a scuzzy bus for all my shit.

701
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,499
Speaker 0: oh my god that computer that computer.

702
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,883
Speaker 0: think about that difference.

703
00:45:45,903 --> 00:45:53,346
Speaker 0: but what happened was AMD came onto the scene and said yo dog you want a processor that costs like a quarter.

704
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:54,229
Speaker 0: what Pentiums do?

705
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,874
Speaker 1: are you a poor college student?

706
00:45:55,894 --> 00:45:58,001
Speaker 1: you can't afford these overpriced Pentium 4s.

707
00:45:58,583 --> 00:45:58,723
Speaker 0: now.

708
00:45:58,764 --> 00:46:00,068
Speaker 0: before that the k6 is.

709
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:04,803
Speaker 0: we're about as fast as the Pentiums but not nearly as reliable.

710
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:07,211
Speaker 0: you had to be a nerd to make that shit work.

711
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:11,466
Speaker 0: Greg Hartman yeah had the k6 - yeah but like if you got him to work.

712
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:16,319
Speaker 0: they were way cheap and they were as fast but the k7 was like double the speed.

713
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:31,101
Speaker 1: yeah so uh yeah yeah then we leapfrog back and forth for a while later in the college years I bought the Athlon which again was much more speedy for the price but very unreliable.

714
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:32,585
Speaker 1: yeah not not be.

715
00:46:32,645 --> 00:46:35,916
Speaker 1: I was very disappointed coming from the BX chipset motherboard.

716
00:46:36,077 --> 00:46:40,456
Speaker 0: of course I have to say right around that time I had to replace my AMD k7 with a Thunderbird.

717
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:42,222
Speaker 0: it was a 200 megahertz faster.

718
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:43,226
Speaker 1: oh that was the cat.

719
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:44,190
Speaker 1: the capacitor explode.

720
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,335
Speaker 0: yeah the capacitor explosions.

721
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,098
Speaker 0: we've talked about that.

722
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:48,868
Speaker 1: that era sure but uh it's unreliable.

723
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:51,800
Speaker 1: BX chipset don't have capacitor explosions.

724
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,787
Speaker 0: in 2007 2008 we actually synced up.

725
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:56,375
Speaker 0: we both bought the same computer the core 2 duo mm-hmm.

726
00:46:56,696 --> 00:46:58,200
Speaker 1: that was when we were in the beacon days.

727
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:09,896
Speaker 0: yeah then I needed a faster computer because we were starting to edge into doing video and my computer was having some bus issues because that jank as a bit motherboard I had.

728
00:47:10,698 --> 00:47:21,123
Speaker 0: so I bought the core i7 920 in 2009. the computer I built in 2009 is the computer I'm still using to this day.

729
00:47:21,143 --> 00:47:22,787
Speaker 0: yep Scott.

730
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:29,625
Speaker 0: meanwhile a few years ago bought 2012 yes bought a much faster computer that is still an i7.

731
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:33,858
Speaker 1: yeah I mean if you have my computer already is three years old.

732
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:45,482
Speaker 1: I bought in July 2012 and if you look at the computer rims thinking about getting the only difference between the rent the computer rim is thinking of getting is that it's 0.5 gigahertz more.

733
00:47:45,502 --> 00:47:48,711
Speaker 1: yep and that's like computers change so much.

734
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:57,758
Speaker 1: we're like a one year apart between a 486 50 and a 486 100. we're like a couple years apart between a 450 and an 800 mega.

735
00:47:57,798 --> 00:47:58,018
Speaker 1: right.

736
00:47:58,379 --> 00:48:02,833
Speaker 1: and now we're like three years back and it's like all right same amount of RAM.

737
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:08,874
Speaker 1: pretty much video cards like my 680 can still play all the games just fine even though it's three years old.

738
00:48:09,717 --> 00:48:11,223
Speaker 1: really it's like what you know.

739
00:48:11,243 --> 00:48:12,649
Speaker 1: I don't need any upgrades at all.

740
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:12,970
Speaker 1: I'm gonna.

741
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,602
Speaker 1: probably every computer I've gotten has lasted four to five years.

742
00:48:15,622 --> 00:48:19,816
Speaker 1: this is probably last six or seven yeah eight.

743
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:27,020
Speaker 0: so if you bought a computer pretty much from 2011 onward there's not really much reason to buy a new computer anytime soon.

744
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,963
Speaker 1: the listeners law having some trouble in the home PC department yeah but my computers from 2009.

745
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:39,298
Speaker 0: so that might not seem like that big a deal because like I have a core i7 it is wicked fast.

746
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:44,575
Speaker 0: like I added 4k video on this computer and it works pretty well.

747
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:45,698
Speaker 1: GPU does most of the work.

748
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:49,811
Speaker 1: you'd be surprised how much work a GPU does that core to do.

749
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:56,490
Speaker 1: I upgraded the GPU at one point and that like made even though I didn't change anything else.

750
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,864
Speaker 1: suddenly everything was way better in the games department.

751
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:00,747
Speaker 0: yeah like out to this.

752
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:09,955
Speaker 0: like my computer now if I turn off that CUDA renderer in the previews and I try to even watch a video in all eight of my hyper cores.

753
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:12,860
Speaker 0: just go 100% yep and stay at 100%.

754
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:21,640
Speaker 0: yeah but so my computer does not have USB 3. whoa my computer does not.

755
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,236
Speaker 1: mine has mostly USB 2 but still in the front and the back has a couple USB 3.

756
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:29,683
Speaker 0: USB 3 did not exist when I built my computer.

757
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:35,619
Speaker 0: Wow my computer does not have PCI Express 3. whoa I have I have to.

758
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,281
Speaker 1: I love.

759
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:36,842
Speaker 1: mine has three.

760
00:49:36,862 --> 00:49:37,684
Speaker 1: mine might only have two.

761
00:49:37,885 --> 00:49:48,996
Speaker 0: I have to 16x PCI Express 2. meaning there is a warning from my gtx 770 video card that says yo dawg you're not getting the full power of this video card.

762
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,284
Speaker 1: mine might only have two might not have three.

763
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:54,176
Speaker 0: m.2 did not exist as a form factor.

764
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:55,924
Speaker 1: yeah no I didn't have that on that either.

765
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:57,130
Speaker 0: yeah but you don't need that really.

766
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,082
Speaker 0: yeah no I only have three gigabit per second SATA not six.

767
00:50:01,884 --> 00:50:02,446
Speaker 1: I have six.

768
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:03,670
Speaker 0: yeah I do not have six.

769
00:50:04,272 --> 00:50:07,945
Speaker 0: so the bottlenecks in my computer not on my drive support six.

770
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:09,209
Speaker 0: so here are the bottlenecks.

771
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:15,649
Speaker 0: I'm running into one if I want to use like OBS to like live stream a complicated game on my computer.

772
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:16,693
Speaker 0: now some things.

773
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:19,123
Speaker 1: I can use my G you can use the Nvidia to help you out with that.

774
00:50:19,344 --> 00:50:20,669
Speaker 0: I can for some games.

775
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:21,572
Speaker 0: not all games.

776
00:50:22,054 --> 00:50:24,464
Speaker 1: mine works with X split because I paid for the X split.

777
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:26,090
Speaker 1: I can do with pretty much everything.

778
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:29,586
Speaker 0: true but like OBS will also use the video card if I use the shadow play.

779
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:33,884
Speaker 0: you're saying yeah we'll use the shadow play but I can still use CUDA to do the rendering right.

780
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:42,855
Speaker 0: but there's all these ancillary things going on like if I'm doing an emulator like emulators are not that CPU efficient and there's a lot of things.

781
00:50:42,896 --> 00:50:45,308
Speaker 0: basically three gigahertz is the sweet spot.

782
00:50:45,328 --> 00:50:46,794
Speaker 0: you want to be just above three gigahertz.

783
00:50:46,814 --> 00:50:47,276
Speaker 1: three and a half.

784
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:49,284
Speaker 0: I've got two point seven.

785
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:51,332
Speaker 0: that's how fucking old my core i7 is.

786
00:50:51,573 --> 00:50:51,813
Speaker 1: really.

787
00:50:51,853 --> 00:50:52,636
Speaker 1: that much difference.

788
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:55,907
Speaker 1: yeah seven three and a half yes there is seven and four.

789
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:57,854
Speaker 1: that'd be a big difference.

790
00:50:57,874 --> 00:50:58,497
Speaker 0: yeah that's the thing.

791
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:13,363
Speaker 0: if I build this new computer for not for like 400 bucks not even I can have a four core eight cores with hyper threading four gigahertz core i7 not bad yeah not bad at all but there's not.

792
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,813
Speaker 0: so the other things I'm running into my OS is on a spinning disk.

793
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:22,935
Speaker 0: because when I built this computer when I built the computer I installed Windows on a 32 gigabyte SSD.

794
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,820
Speaker 0: because let me tell you what in 2009 SSDs were not cheap.

795
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:31,700
Speaker 0: nowadays Windows won't fit on a 32 gigabyte SSD.

796
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,007
Speaker 0: yeah I transferred it to a spinning disk.

797
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:37,379
Speaker 0: it would be a giant pain in the ass to transfer it back to an SSD.

798
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:41,292
Speaker 1: I have a small SSD but I also have a big one that I bought.

799
00:51:41,413 --> 00:51:41,895
Speaker 1: that's ticked.

800
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:45,268
Speaker 1: I have a 256 and a 128. nowadays you can get like terabyte ones.

801
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:45,670
Speaker 1: yeah.

802
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:46,773
Speaker 0: so here's the thing with.

803
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:53,054
Speaker 0: if I build a new computer I can get a 512 gigabyte m.2 SSD which it looks like a RAM chip.

804
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,260
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much literally.

805
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,525
Speaker 0: just stick it in the motherboard.

806
00:51:55,586 --> 00:51:57,052
Speaker 0: yep on a special connector.

807
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:57,413
Speaker 0: yeah.

808
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:00,062
Speaker 1: so my OS you don't even need SATA ports.

809
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,049
Speaker 1: yeah my OS and all my apps you know.

810
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:06,710
Speaker 1: the best part about that is is that you don't need to wire a cable from the power supply over to the drive.

811
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,455
Speaker 1: yeah you just put it in the motherboard.

812
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:08,876
Speaker 1: it's done.

813
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:10,300
Speaker 1: that's part of it.

814
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,163
Speaker 1: yeah.

815
00:52:11,764 --> 00:52:20,587
Speaker 0: so the other thing is it'll be six gigabits per second instead of three and IO is the single biggest bottleneck.

816
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:27,496
Speaker 0: now not even the fact that Windows is not a spinning disk is actually that doesn't matter much because of ready cache and I have you know so much.

817
00:52:27,557 --> 00:52:28,962
Speaker 0: RAM like that doesn't matter.

818
00:52:29,504 --> 00:52:37,050
Speaker 0: my computer is slow when I reboot rebooted for like an hour but once it's like everything's cached and in RAM it's fine.

819
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:48,754
Speaker 0: when I'm doing video editing and I got a bunch of 4k videos they're on SSDs they're on three gigabit per second SSDs.

820
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:59,744
Speaker 0: that's actually not enough and my disk IO buses max out when I'm doing a lot of the other real bonus of the m2 thing is that you can have a really small case.

821
00:53:00,466 --> 00:53:02,013
Speaker 0: yeah I'd really don't like big case.

822
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:06,032
Speaker 1: it's like the GPU and the power supply are the only big things left that go in the case.

823
00:53:06,112 --> 00:53:11,676
Speaker 1: otherwise you could pretty much as a flat motherboard right and that's it you could have like this really flat computer.

824
00:53:11,696 --> 00:53:12,320
Speaker 1: that's ridiculous.

825
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:21,656
Speaker 1: that like a video card except for the fact that this GPU and a power supply right if you have a bunch of Express cards for like firewire right but like if you don't need the other stuff.

826
00:53:21,696 --> 00:53:27,423
Speaker 1: you could maybe lay the GPU sideways and save a ton of space but that power supply is just hanging on the edge there.

827
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:34,368
Speaker 1: it could still be really really small though if you wanted it to maybe a specially shaped power supply like an l-shaped one.

828
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:40,687
Speaker 0: yeah I don't know but you know all these other things like USB 3 I'd really like to have.

829
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:41,891
Speaker 1: yeah that's good to have.

830
00:53:42,373 --> 00:53:48,434
Speaker 0: so I was speccing out like and I specked out what computer I built today and I specked out two versions.

831
00:53:48,514 --> 00:53:49,437
Speaker 0: I specked out the.

832
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:52,286
Speaker 0: I need to shave money where I can like.

833
00:53:52,748 --> 00:53:56,358
Speaker 0: yeah there's a $350 motherboard but this $210 motherboard is pretty much just as good like.

834
00:53:56,378 --> 00:53:56,799
Speaker 0: you can shave like.

835
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:03,137
Speaker 1: what is the difference between a 350 and 200?

836
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:04,321
Speaker 1: so you want to know the difference?

837
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:07,132
Speaker 1: well get a different spot.

838
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:09,382
Speaker 1: why would I ever spy the $300 motherboard?

839
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:10,165
Speaker 1: that makes no sense.

840
00:54:10,426 --> 00:54:12,898
Speaker 1: well I can't imagine what it does that I would need.

841
00:54:12,978 --> 00:54:18,306
Speaker 0: here's what I've been thinking about and I realized this because I didn't experiment - that's a ridiculous motherboard you don't need.

842
00:54:18,326 --> 00:54:19,110
Speaker 1: I can see it from here.

843
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,244
Speaker 0: it is a ridiculous motherboard you don't need except there's a few things.

844
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:23,650
Speaker 1: what it's ridiculous?

845
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:28,745
Speaker 0: plastic cover not cool but plastic means you don't have to dust it.

846
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,989
Speaker 0: that's bullshit.

847
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:31,554
Speaker 1: just have a positive pressure case next.

848
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:33,180
Speaker 0: now you'll still get Dustin whatever.

849
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,324
Speaker 0: so one.

850
00:54:35,026 --> 00:54:44,136
Speaker 0: if you amortize the money you spend on a computer over that useful time anything someone tells themselves to buy the $300 not.

851
00:54:44,176 --> 00:54:46,847
Speaker 0: the moral of all this at the end Scott is I'm not buying this computer.

852
00:54:47,027 --> 00:54:50,303
Speaker 0: okay I'm not buying it sure but I'm gonna tell you the things.

853
00:54:50,323 --> 00:54:52,151
Speaker 1: this motherboard what this motherboard looks like.

854
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:58,334
Speaker 0: if I see it again in person there is no reason cheaper motherboards could not do what this motherboard does.

855
00:54:58,435 --> 00:54:58,736
Speaker 0: all right.

856
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:01,610
Speaker 0: so one this motherboard actually has a pretty clever thing.

857
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:05,322
Speaker 0: it has this cooler built into the motherboard every mother.

858
00:55:05,362 --> 00:55:06,627
Speaker 0: but it's no not like this.

859
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:08,675
Speaker 1: you're believing the advertising?

860
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:13,154
Speaker 0: and no no so they're sure this cross cut like cooling thing would actually be really good.

861
00:55:13,255 --> 00:55:18,636
Speaker 0: okay if you're gonna overclock which I'm not gonna so it's not useful to me don't need to overclock.

862
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:22,146
Speaker 0: the processor I'm gonna buy is four gigahertz stock right?

863
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:23,250
Speaker 0: yeah yeah.

864
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:25,216
Speaker 0: but so here's the thing.

865
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:30,473
Speaker 0: when you put RAM into it you don't have to push it down with both sides and then click it.

866
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:31,296
Speaker 0: all the cards.

867
00:55:31,618 --> 00:55:35,092
Speaker 0: you'll stick them in from the side and just push them down from one side.

868
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,823
Speaker 0: they're designed to slide in from an angle with only one Clippy.

869
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:41,277
Speaker 1: so this thing you're going to do once in your entire life.

870
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,286
Speaker 1: yeah just clip RAM sticks into the motherboard.

871
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:47,865
Speaker 1: you're willing to pay an extra hundred dollars for that experience of clicking ramp guys in one.

872
00:55:47,905 --> 00:55:48,789
Speaker 0: what did I just say?

873
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,535
Speaker 1: I'm not buying this computer.

874
00:55:50,796 --> 00:55:53,025
Speaker 1: I'll take the harder to click in RAM sticks for $100.

875
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:53,346
Speaker 1: savings please.

876
00:55:54,872 --> 00:55:59,613
Speaker 0: it's also actually reinforced on the bottom with these big steel plates so you can just fucking push on it.

877
00:55:59,654 --> 00:56:03,131
Speaker 1: if that one time that you put the motherboard in the case you don't have to be careful.

878
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:09,753
Speaker 0: yeah yeah that one time I've seen people push ram in here a little click motherboards they suck.

879
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:11,839
Speaker 0: well also they're usually buying some crap.

880
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:16,756
Speaker 0: Oh motherboard yeah anyway now doesn't really have much else to offer.

881
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:18,223
Speaker 0: that actually matters like this.

882
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:24,850
Speaker 0: why even talking about the stupid motherboard other than it has twice as many USB 3 ports as any other one of those motherboards?

883
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:25,311
Speaker 1: how many?

884
00:56:26,293 --> 00:56:30,201
Speaker 0: uh one two three four five six and then it has four.

885
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:36,254
Speaker 0: it has a six USB threes two USB twos and a bunch of other stuff.

886
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:38,500
Speaker 1: yeah of course it's not big deal yeah.

887
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:49,906
Speaker 0: but other than that like the more expensive motherboards unless you're overclocking or doing something weird like they have all these things that only matter if you're fucking with the computer.

888
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,453
Speaker 0: a lot like it's all these buttons.

889
00:56:51,494 --> 00:56:57,443
Speaker 1: yeah if you're taking RAM in and out all the time to test a bunch of different RAM sticks absolutely I'm buying the extra hundred other mother boy.

890
00:56:57,603 --> 00:57:06,963
Speaker 0: yep it's got like extra buttons like you can do a memory test just by hitting a button on the motherboard without even I do that so often yeah but so I'm always slightly wary of stuff like that.

891
00:57:07,004 --> 00:57:12,645
Speaker 1: like really is there a problem with this motherboard that I need to keep doing memory tests all the time again?

892
00:57:13,368 --> 00:57:15,254
Speaker 0: if you're like overclocking or some crap?

893
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:18,705
Speaker 0: sure yeah yeah but even then think of it this way.

894
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:24,947
Speaker 0: the weird crazy motherboard is like a hundred bucks more than the normal motherboard like.

895
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:28,681
Speaker 0: it's interesting how the prices don't actually really scale that much.

896
00:57:28,701 --> 00:57:30,729
Speaker 0: there's still a really minimal range of price.

897
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,615
Speaker 1: dollars is a lot because it's 33% of the price.

898
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:49,427
Speaker 0: yeah but in the grand scheme of a computer if you're buying a computer for upgrade ability the money I spent that computer in 2009 amortized until 2015. all the things I spent money on forward compatibility kind of washed out mm-hmm.

899
00:57:49,908 --> 00:58:02,042
Speaker 0: but the real the real sweet spot is that right now there is pretty much one processor to buy the core i7 4790. it's four gigahertz it's 350 bucks.

900
00:58:02,503 --> 00:58:03,646
Speaker 0: it's four cores.

901
00:58:03,686 --> 00:58:10,950
Speaker 0: cost as much as a fancy motherboard yeah but you can buy the much cheaper motherboard and this processor and oh that's a good move.

902
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,980
Speaker 0: it comes with a stock cooler that works just fine.

903
00:58:13,161 --> 00:58:18,741
Speaker 0: yeah if you're not gonna overclock which you shouldn't shouldn't 32 gigabytes of RAM is like 150 bucks.

904
00:58:18,801 --> 00:58:19,122
Speaker 0: I still have.

905
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:27,152
Speaker 1: 32 gigabytes of RAM was cheap when I bought my computer because I still I had 32 gigabytes of RAM then and I still do now and it's still.

906
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,818
Speaker 1: I've never filled it up.

907
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:35,465
Speaker 1: even when I had like a virtual machine minimized and I was playing a full-screen Scott I filled up my current computer and an Adobe app open.

908
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:37,052
Speaker 0: my current computers.

909
00:58:37,112 --> 00:58:43,999
Speaker 0: RAM is actually really slow and my web browsers are open and minimized when I hold my computer is my computer has something that disappeared.

910
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:48,232
Speaker 0: hmm six dim slots three-way interleaving in the RAM.

911
00:58:48,934 --> 00:58:49,556
Speaker 0: that's gone.

912
00:58:49,576 --> 00:58:53,528
Speaker 0: that doesn't exist anymore okay so I have six dims in my computer.

913
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:55,693
Speaker 1: right now I have four eights.

914
00:58:55,733 --> 00:59:02,092
Speaker 0: I think yeah but yes for like 1200 bucks you can build an amazing badass computer.

915
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:06,530
Speaker 1: assuming you already know my computer was like not that much money well maybe I should.

916
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:09,102
Speaker 1: was it was this the time that I spent too much money I forget?

917
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:10,288
Speaker 0: yeah I looked at all.

918
00:59:10,368 --> 00:59:13,340
Speaker 0: I went through all my old Newegg invoices.

919
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,404
Speaker 1: I think the reason it was.

920
00:59:14,464 --> 00:59:14,725
Speaker 1: I haven't.

921
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:21,858
Speaker 1: I can't look at it right now but I think the reason mine is expensive because I went all out and got the ridiculous 680 which is like the top-of-the-line video card at the time.

922
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:31,949
Speaker 0: yeah see this assumes I'm not buying a video card but it assumes I'm buying a really fast m.2 SATA like you know six gigabit per second.

923
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:32,390
Speaker 1: yeah I never.

924
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:34,441
Speaker 1: I don't include the storage in the cost of the computer.

925
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:38,379
Speaker 0: I'm including the storage because now storage is the primary bottleneck.

926
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:44,421
Speaker 1: I may have to buy some storage though even though I'm not buying a new computer anytime soon because I might have SSDs.

927
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:51,684
Speaker 1: I have a big SSD I think it's a 512 you know for my OS and program files and then I have a smaller one.

928
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:55,175
Speaker 1: I think it's a 128 for like the Adobe app swap space.

929
00:59:55,296 --> 01:00:01,398
Speaker 1: yep I have a swap space used to be my primary SSD when I had in the previous in the core two and then I you know moved it down.

930
01:00:01,418 --> 01:00:07,246
Speaker 1: I just cascade all the SSDs down to less important do and I've got a NES which has all my backups and all sorts of other stuff.

931
01:00:07,326 --> 01:00:11,963
Speaker 1: but I still have some giant magnetic discs for like my documents my photos yeah.

932
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,950
Speaker 0: so nowadays I was looking videos.

933
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:18,162
Speaker 0: you know how much a two terabyte 7200 rpm spin in this cost.

934
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:19,787
Speaker 1: how much 60 bucks?

935
01:00:20,228 --> 01:00:23,861
Speaker 1: are you sure that's not the weirdo cheap unreliable like you know what.

936
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:27,073
Speaker 0: just buy four of them and put them in a raid 10.

937
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:38,076
Speaker 1: I think when Windows 10 comes out I think I'm gonna buy and replace my magnetic discs with some other bigger ones so I can know what we're out of space for videos and I can I'm going to have more comfortably edit the videos.

938
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:45,402
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have all SSDs for everything except like video that I'm not working on anymore and like photos and stuff for there.

939
01:00:45,804 --> 01:00:55,538
Speaker 0: I'm just getting like four two terabyte drives and just raid them up and just stick them in the case hmm cuz for like that'll make my Lightroom workflow a million times easier.

940
01:00:56,461 --> 01:01:00,538
Speaker 1: frankly yeah I just weaver Windows 10 so I can do the clean install and everything will be yes.

941
01:01:00,558 --> 01:01:04,053
Speaker 0: also Windows 10 is gonna have some really fancy drive volume stuff.

942
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:05,920
Speaker 1: so like wait like how's that gonna work?

943
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:09,051
Speaker 0: so you know windows can kind of do like raid stuff.

944
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,458
Speaker 0: now on its own it can.

945
01:01:11,499 --> 01:01:13,565
Speaker 0: it's actually pretty good it just it's not worth it.

946
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:19,950
Speaker 0: the word on the street is that Windows 10 is volume management obviates the need for some of that motherboard.

947
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,954
Speaker 0: bullshit raid.

948
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:32,979
Speaker 0: hmm and you can just tell it like hey these four drives they're actually one drive and it just does it and this is the kind of parody I want and it's actually performing and cool and some smart people have been telling me some stuff.

949
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:35,330
Speaker 1: I don't want any parody in my computer right cuz?

950
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:36,434
Speaker 0: oh yeah you do.

951
01:01:36,715 --> 01:01:39,124
Speaker 1: I'm just using backups on the NAS which is parody.

952
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:41,712
Speaker 1: I want more space and speed in my in the computer.

953
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:47,108
Speaker 0: yeah but thing are so cheap that just do a raid 10 a four discs.

954
01:01:47,348 --> 01:01:51,182
Speaker 0: two of them are just mirrors of the other two the drive the disk anymore space.

955
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:53,932
Speaker 0: each you'll have four terabytes of usable space.

956
01:01:53,952 --> 01:02:00,090
Speaker 0: it's four terabytes of usable space a hundred percent redundant with double throughput.

957
01:02:00,271 --> 01:02:07,938
Speaker 1: on reads that I guess right now I've got a one terabyte in to 500 so that'll cost you doubling my space under 400 bucks.

958
01:02:08,118 --> 01:02:08,681
Speaker 1: yeah it's cheap.

959
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:17,475
Speaker 0: that's cheaper than a Drobo and you don't have to buy some proprietary external thing that then you know Lightroom freaks out because like the NAS is asleep or whatever.

960
01:02:17,555 --> 01:02:33,764
Speaker 1: that actually would be nice though if you could get like I was talking about before the small computer if you could just you know put the video card on the side and make the power supply smaller yeah if you can get the really small computer that still didn't sacrifice anything power wise then the DAS suddenly becomes great.

961
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:40,567
Speaker 1: sitting next to that right because you just like shove the DAS under the desk somewhere but a long cable hide it away you know.

962
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:46,414
Speaker 1: keep the small computer within reach so you can hit the power button and then he's just all monitors everywhere mouse keyboard yeah.

963
01:02:47,257 --> 01:02:51,833
Speaker 0: so anyway that the whole sum of all this is what I decided is like Scott doesn't need to upgrade.

964
01:02:52,094 --> 01:03:03,672
Speaker 0: I do need to upgrade but there is no reason upgrade right now because when I built my computer in 2009 it lasted until 2000 and fucking 16. the computer I build in 2006 will 15.

965
01:03:03,672 --> 01:03:04,053
Speaker 0: I guess.

966
01:03:04,354 --> 01:03:07,925
Speaker 0: cuz I'm gonna buy it before the end of this year but near the end of this year.

967
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:10,053
Speaker 0: September is when to do it.

968
01:03:10,093 --> 01:03:10,896
Speaker 0: wait till September.

969
01:03:11,136 --> 01:03:11,839
Speaker 1: why September?

970
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:16,394
Speaker 0: because if you wait a little bit longer Intel Skylake is coming.

971
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:19,021
Speaker 0: okay the next Intel architecture.

972
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:21,769
Speaker 0: this is the talk the architecture shape.

973
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:22,250
Speaker 1: big one.

974
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,455
Speaker 0: this replaces Broadwell.

975
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:26,821
Speaker 0: huh Broadwell had a really short life.

976
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:32,497
Speaker 0: okay skylake actually is a big jump forward.

977
01:03:32,617 --> 01:03:33,780
Speaker 1: what are they doing in sky like this?

978
01:03:33,841 --> 01:03:34,643
Speaker 0: okay skylakes.

979
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:38,474
Speaker 0: one is gonna support DDR4 which is already starting to appear.

980
01:03:38,755 --> 01:03:39,517
Speaker 0: okay.

981
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:41,463
Speaker 0: so DDR3 is reaching end of life.

982
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:45,656
Speaker 0: skylake specifically is going to backward compatibility.

983
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:54,382
Speaker 0: support DDR3 in case you have some six-liner so you can build a new computer at the end of the year with a brand new skylake core i7.

984
01:03:54,402 --> 01:03:59,314
Speaker 0: like ridiculous thing but with existing RAM that's super cheap.

985
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:05,150
Speaker 0: and then two years later when DDR4 is cheap just upgrade mm-hmm.

986
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,879
Speaker 1: is it gonna be that much faster to have DDR4 instead of three?

987
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:10,810
Speaker 0: DDR3 was that much faster than two was it?

988
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,399
Speaker 0: yeah yeah there was RAM.

989
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,823
Speaker 0: getting faster mattered a lot.

990
01:04:14,843 --> 01:04:20,216
Speaker 0: just we've been in this DDR3 like I can't 1333 for a long time anyway.

991
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:24,608
Speaker 0: yeah also having more RAM having it faster kind of matters.

992
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:33,562
Speaker 0: there's tons of other stuff in skylake but the gist of it is that skylake is gonna start having support for things like Thunderbolt 3 and the motherboards and the chipsets.

993
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:36,975
Speaker 0: supposedly there's a new chipset coming the sunrise point.

994
01:04:36,996 --> 01:04:40,528
Speaker 1: they're just coming out with crazier and crazier names every day.

995
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:48,709
Speaker 0: but as far as I can tell point skylake is the next like really big micro architecture shift from Intel.

996
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:52,285
Speaker 0: so if you're gonna buy a brand new computer might as well just start using.

997
01:04:52,406 --> 01:05:06,724
Speaker 1: we should make a computer hardware company that makes PC parts and use all cyberpunk names for everything who be like yeah our new chip the Matsumoto Taka Drive whatever.

998
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:18,058
Speaker 0: but you know you you want me you want to build a computer for maximum forward compatibility and follow the rim lifestyle of spend a lot of money on a crazy computer and then use it forever.

999
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:22,916
Speaker 0: wait until September because August is when skylake supposedly is gonna come out.

1000
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:26,369
Speaker 0: skylake will have the most forward compatibility.

1001
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,373
Speaker 1: I think about this for a second.

1002
01:05:27,393 --> 01:05:27,534
Speaker 1: look.

1003
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:30,265
Speaker 1: up in the sky there's clouds and shit and a lake.

1004
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:34,484
Speaker 1: it's just water up there but there's no ground holding the water into a lake shape.

1005
01:05:34,524 --> 01:05:40,265
Speaker 1: that's just water in a lake shape up in the sky and for once birds are swimming in it fish.

1006
01:05:40,506 --> 01:05:42,011
Speaker 0: it's easy to fall into a trap.

1007
01:05:42,111 --> 01:05:44,921
Speaker 0: in of September comes ooh skylake.

1008
01:05:45,001 --> 01:05:51,478
Speaker 0: see what you can look at Intel's roadmap you can look at Wikipedia and you can see cannon lake is coming.

1009
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,527
Speaker 0: cannon lake is after skylake boom.

1010
01:05:56,229 --> 01:05:58,394
Speaker 0: that's when they go down to 10 nanometers.

1011
01:05:58,394 --> 01:06:03,907
Speaker 0: 10 all right 10. here's why this is not a problem.

1012
01:06:04,348 --> 01:06:11,384
Speaker 0: that's not coming out till 2017. so if you're gonna upgrade upgrade in 2015 don't wait two more years.

1013
01:06:12,787 --> 01:06:17,321
Speaker 1: so yeah uh the 10 nanometers will matter more in the laptop area.

1014
01:06:17,622 --> 01:06:19,749
Speaker 0: well yeah the thing is cannon lake is a tick.

1015
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:21,314
Speaker 0: it's not a huge change.

1016
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:23,481
Speaker 0: they're just shrinking skylake basically.

1017
01:06:23,661 --> 01:06:24,805
Speaker 1: next it'll be sky ocean.

1018
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:28,295
Speaker 1: yeah well in an ocean the the successor.

1019
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:34,252
Speaker 0: there's debate over this next successor but it seems like skylake is the confluence of.

1020
01:06:34,553 --> 01:06:39,688
Speaker 0: chipsets are getting more modern big changes in architecture long cycle.

1021
01:06:40,169 --> 01:06:43,099
Speaker 0: skylake is gonna be the beginning of a long forward curve.

1022
01:06:43,561 --> 01:06:47,515
Speaker 0: so the computer I specked out that I'm going to sorry you suck now.

1023
01:06:47,535 --> 01:06:50,988
Speaker 0: yeah AMD is I mean on entity sort of got burned by.

1024
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,132
Speaker 1: you know evil monopoly.

1025
01:06:52,252 --> 01:06:53,617
Speaker 1: but I mean chips.

1026
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:55,041
Speaker 1: quality is the quality.

1027
01:06:55,061 --> 01:07:00,040
Speaker 0: yeah guys like when I when I put installed a case seven like shit didn't work on the first boot.

1028
01:07:00,542 --> 01:07:02,310
Speaker 0: Thunderbird shit didn't work on the first boot.

1029
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:07,409
Speaker 1: I have a whole lot member I. you know I said I only had an Athlon one out of my four computers.

1030
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:08,172
Speaker 1: as an AMD.

1031
01:07:08,613 --> 01:07:12,506
Speaker 1: I got a lot of AMD motherboards a lot of AMD chips because that shit broke a lot.

1032
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:17,216
Speaker 0: yep meanwhile all my Intel stuff is a hundred percent fine.

1033
01:07:17,236 --> 01:07:25,405
Speaker 0: in fact when I buy my new computer my existing one super powerful still I'm turning it into a dedicated Civ 5 pit boss server.

1034
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:27,692
Speaker 0: okay it'll run that just fine.

1035
01:07:27,712 --> 01:07:30,680
Speaker 1: yeah it's a little overkill.

1036
01:07:31,723 --> 01:07:40,454
Speaker 0: no because you actually need a computer that can fully run Civ 5 as though you're playing it as a client to be a pit boss server because of poor architecture decisions.

1037
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:43,626
Speaker 0: okay so you have to be a player to be a pit boss server all right.

1038
01:07:43,948 --> 01:07:46,512
Speaker 0: so yeah I kind of do need it for that which kind of sucks.

1039
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:55,160
Speaker 0: but this has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
