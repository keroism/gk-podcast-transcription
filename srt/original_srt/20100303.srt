1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,215
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, March 3rd.

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,037
Speaker 1: I'm Rip.

3
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:13,718
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,162
Speaker 1: And this is Deaknights.

5
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:18,210
Speaker 1: Tonight, the great momma hosted a movie, Summer Wars.

6
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:23,929
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,699
Speaker 1: We're kind of on a roll here anime show-wise.

8
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:32,784
Speaker 0: Are we really?

9
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:40,070
Speaker 1: We had that long, uh, I don't know how we ended up just not doing Wednesday shows for so long and suddenly we got like two in a row almost.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think it's cuz we did.

11
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,962
Speaker 0: we did a Tuesday Wednesday week, right?

12
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:46,170
Speaker 0: Because yeah, those are the shows that we, yeah.

13
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,230
Speaker 1: We had all that unrelated stuff like snow and everything getting in the way.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,010
Speaker 0: It's also weird because I've been, it's mostly like anime season right now for some reason.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,190
Speaker 0: Like I watched every episode of Durara that is on Crunchyroll and I finished Hokuto no Ken 1.

16
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,438
Speaker 0: I didn't realize, I had like 150 something episodes of Hokuto no Ken.

17
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:10,210
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that like episode 100 something is actually the end.

18
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:12,703
Speaker 0: And then Hokuto no Ken 2 begins.

19
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:13,850
Speaker 0: I was unaware.

20
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:17,570
Speaker 1: Well, there's always like the movie, those terrible live-actions.

21
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now I'm watching, uh, I watched Votoms episode 1.

22
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:22,603
Speaker 0: So.

23
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:23,125
Speaker 1: See what I mean?

24
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,790
Speaker 0: While I'm waiting for more Durarara.

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,127
Speaker 1: It's hard to, Votoms feels kind of like it's got that gimmick with like the eyes in the mechs.

26
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:30,910
Speaker 0: That's just for the toys.

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it feels kind of Gundam-y, but I know it goes way away from Gundam.

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,810
Speaker 0: At least the first episode is definitely Gundam-y because it's basically like, think about how every Gundam starts.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,656
Speaker 0: Some guys are stealing a Gundam.

30
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:43,057
Speaker 0: Yep.

31
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,042
Speaker 0: Some guys are, every, right?

32
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:48,010
Speaker 1: Except replace Gundam with girl in a suitcase.

33
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,395
Speaker 0: Well, that's, you know, that's Outlaw Star.

34
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:50,756
Speaker 0: Yeah.

35
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:56,170
Speaker 0: So all these, you know, I realize it's something that a lot of these big sci-fi shows have in common, right?

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:06,490
Speaker 0: A typical trope is that they want to start in media res with some action, but you can't really get any action if you don't have some sort of, you know, reason for a battle yet.

37
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,314
Speaker 0: So they can't do the battles right away.

38
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,697
Speaker 0: You know what they have to do.

39
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:15,150
Speaker 1: Unless they start in media res with the battle that they don't tell you why they're fighting or they explain it as it's going.

40
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,836
Speaker 0: I mean, Yamato sort of did that.

41
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:20,250
Speaker 0: Yamato did it with like, you know, the battle where Earth gets his ass kicked.

42
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:27,650
Speaker 0: And that's basically now the only hope left is, you know, the Yamato, because every all the other ships blew up and they start with the losing battle.

43
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,053
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's episode one.

44
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:30,654
Speaker 0: It's not a spoiler.

45
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:43,130
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know, the what, so what they do is they start with like an operation, like a single like operation of some like, you know, pirates or some thieves, but an operation that sort of like Navy SEAL operation.

46
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:49,962
Speaker 0: And then that operation unfolds into the greater picture, usually because it goes wrong.

47
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:54,730
Speaker 1: Something happens and the main character is spurred on by whatever that operation was.

48
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:58,155
Speaker 1: Either they killed their mom or they killed Rusty.

49
00:02:58,696 --> 00:02:58,916
Speaker 0: Yeah.

50
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:02,782
Speaker 0: You know, it's basically there's some sort of mission that they begin with.

51
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:08,570
Speaker 0: And that, you know, mission unfolds into the rest of the show and Votoms and Gundam Seed and Zeta Gundam.

52
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,052
Speaker 0: And they all do the same thing.

53
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:10,793
Speaker 1: We're on a mission.

54
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:11,294
Speaker 1: Yeah.

55
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:12,155
Speaker 1: Mission from God.

56
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,119
Speaker 0: I think Idaeon does a similar thing.

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:15,800
Speaker 0: You know.

58
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:16,461
Speaker 1: Yeah.

59
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:20,547
Speaker 1: I haven't watched any more Votoms than you, so I don't really have anything to say about it.

60
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:21,128
Speaker 0: But you watch.

61
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:22,350
Speaker 0: you watch more than one episode.

62
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,213
Speaker 1: I watched one and a half episodes.

63
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,615
Speaker 0: You watched half an episode more than me.

64
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:26,216
Speaker 1: You know what?

65
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,199
Speaker 1: I still don't think I know much more than what you know.

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,261
Speaker 0: No, I actually I had to.

67
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:30,183
Speaker 0: He got away.

68
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:33,047
Speaker 0: I might have to rewatch the first episode and pay more attention.

69
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:34,650
Speaker 0: I was like eating dinner at the same time.

70
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,591
Speaker 1: What really happened?

71
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:37,073
Speaker 1: The guy is part of a mission.

72
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:38,395
Speaker 1: He's like, I don't know what's going on.

73
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,637
Speaker 1: And you're all acting really shady.

74
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:43,263
Speaker 0: Well, what I didn't understand really was the because I wasn't paying enough attention.

75
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:43,903
Speaker 0: was the?

76
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:44,504
Speaker 0: was they?

77
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:48,230
Speaker 0: there was some bigger picture stuff like he was fighting his own man and there was a war.

78
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,492
Speaker 0: And who were they fighting against?

79
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,375
Speaker 0: And they sort of explained it, but I didn't read it.

80
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,318
Speaker 0: I wasn't looking at the subtitles.

81
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,722
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was he got he was out.

82
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,325
Speaker 1: He got picked up by this other unit.

83
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,510
Speaker 1: That unit was doing shady shit, basically robbing Fort Knox.

84
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,111
Speaker 1: And they're like.

85
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:04,275
Speaker 1: they tell him, yeah, just follow orders.

86
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:05,436
Speaker 1: No, he's a superior officer.

87
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,119
Speaker 1: Technically help us out with this mission.

88
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:09,442
Speaker 1: And he's like, you guys are doing something shady.

89
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,405
Speaker 1: They're basically shut up and stand there and help us.

90
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:14,710
Speaker 0: And then he got tortured when he got caught by his own guys.

91
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,752
Speaker 1: Like, why'd you rob Fort Knox?

92
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,675
Speaker 0: And he's like, I don't know.

93
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:19,536
Speaker 0: And he really didn't know.

94
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:20,377
Speaker 0: But I didn't believe him.

95
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:21,839
Speaker 0: And, you know, who could blame them?

96
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,042
Speaker 0: But they still why were they all torturing?

97
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:24,583
Speaker 0: That's not good.

98
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:25,164
Speaker 1: Yeah.

99
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,668
Speaker 1: Clearly, the quote unquote good guys are actually the bad guys in both.

100
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:29,870
Speaker 0: That's that's what I'm figuring.

101
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,960
Speaker 0: Because you look and it's like, OK, there were guys who were traitors to the guys that he was originally with.

102
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,162
Speaker 1: And they are bad people.

103
00:04:38,282 --> 00:04:39,183
Speaker 0: And they're bad people.

104
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:44,270
Speaker 0: And then the guys that he was originally with are all torturing him and not believing that he doesn't know anything.

105
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,011
Speaker 0: We didn't know anything.

106
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,173
Speaker 1: Also bad people.

107
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:48,316
Speaker 0: Everyone that he was with is bad people.

108
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:52,603
Speaker 0: And it seems like whoever they were fighting the war against and are now declaring peace with must be the good guy.

109
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:57,310
Speaker 1: Later on, he ends up with a Venus Wars style kind of crew of people on a planet somewhere.

110
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,112
Speaker 0: That could be cool.

111
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:03,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of what I'm waiting for, because I felt this urge to watch a lot of episodes.

112
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:04,605
Speaker 0: It's like seven episodes per disc.

113
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,028
Speaker 0: And it's like eight discs.

114
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,170
Speaker 0: It's mostly like 50 something.

115
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,013
Speaker 1: Well, Jess and Katsu watched like the whole thing at Wildwood.

116
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:10,633
Speaker 0: They're crazy.

117
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:13,116
Speaker 0: They didn't go to the beach and they sat inside and watched.

118
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:16,700
Speaker 1: But I kept walking by the TV throughout the week and seeing, oh, that show looks kind of cool.

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,020
Speaker 1: What is it?

120
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,841
Speaker 1: They're like, vote arms.

121
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:18,982
Speaker 1: Hey, what are you watching now?

122
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:19,563
Speaker 1: Vote arms.

123
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:26,050
Speaker 0: The only thing that makes me sad is like I'm really in a mood for the sci fi space anime shows and I'm running out.

124
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,076
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, there's still plenty to go, but they're not making more of these really.

125
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:35,079
Speaker 0: at a rate I can watch them faster than they make them one.

126
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,360
Speaker 0: And then what do I do?

127
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,703
Speaker 1: You've at least got Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

128
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:42,727
Speaker 1: That's like this gigantic blob just waiting for the last one.

129
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:45,710
Speaker 0: And then just kill yourself and then kill myself after I finish.

130
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,132
Speaker 1: But here's the trouble I have.

131
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:53,980
Speaker 1: The problem with anime right now is that what got almost everyone in our generation now into anime were these kinds of shows.

132
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,445
Speaker 1: Was it because it was anime or was it because it happened to be anime?

133
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:02,890
Speaker 1: But what it was was space, sci fi or people getting cut off all bloody.

134
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,451
Speaker 1: It was no.

135
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,173
Speaker 0: Well, it was awesome plots.

136
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:11,701
Speaker 0: It was, you know, movies with these, you know, intelligent plots that are as good as sci fi books.

137
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:18,330
Speaker 1: But I'll submit that we even liked, at least when we were getting into anime, really dumb stuff that was still kind of sci fi.

138
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,972
Speaker 0: We were also kids.

139
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:20,633
Speaker 1: Yeah.

140
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,015
Speaker 1: I mean, I thought Wind of Amnesia.

141
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:22,435
Speaker 0: We were just.

142
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:23,918
Speaker 0: we were just smart kids.

143
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:27,102
Speaker 0: And now we look back and some of the stuff was good and some it was bad.

144
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:32,370
Speaker 1: And we look back at the stuff that was Venus Wars when I was a kid was this great like war tragedy.

145
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,295
Speaker 1: I thought it was so serious business and awesome.

146
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,699
Speaker 1: And I think it's still kind of is except for the end with the tank.

147
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:39,843
Speaker 1: Yeah.

148
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,270
Speaker 1: But Emily and I finally finished Ghost in the Shell standalone complex again.

149
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,797
Speaker 0: Again, I was going to say I've seen it twice.

150
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,590
Speaker 1: But even then, I kind of forgot a bunch of stuff that happens at the end.

151
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,359
Speaker 0: I mostly remember like individual episodes.

152
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,370
Speaker 0: The overall plot is pretty much just like laughing man.

153
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:56,437
Speaker 0: Ha ha ha ha.

154
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,269
Speaker 1: You know, yeah, kind of.

155
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,210
Speaker 1: But something weird happens at the end.

156
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,390
Speaker 1: And I noticed all this stuff that now that I've seen second gig do, you know, watching it in retrospect, it really just sets up second gig.

157
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might be definitely.

158
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,630
Speaker 0: I could definitely see it being one of those intense situations.

159
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,890
Speaker 0: You watch it again and now suddenly you see more.

160
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,852
Speaker 0: But a second go.

161
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:22,190
Speaker 1: only in the last episode, the last episode, the major picks something up and looks at it like, I know what that is now.

162
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,990
Speaker 1: And something weird happens to someone I can't spoil.

163
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,030
Speaker 1: And I think that is like exactly what starts second gig.

164
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,509
Speaker 1: I got to watch the last episode again before we send the Netflix back.

165
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,314
Speaker 0: All right.

166
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:40,930
Speaker 1: So anime news, there actually is a tiny bit of anime going to do a news.

167
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,974
Speaker 0: I was going to do a geek bite.

168
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:45,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I'm going to do a news because, you know, the Trigun movie is coming.

169
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,230
Speaker 1: And I got to admit, I'm actually really freaking excited about this.

170
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,648
Speaker 0: I'm not really freaking excited, but I want to watch it.

171
00:07:50,990 --> 00:08:02,590
Speaker 1: Well, I think my prediction here is that the movie, coupled with the fact that Naito is doing another Trigun manga, there is going to be a resurgence of Trigun fandom, not in Japan, but in the rest of the world.

172
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:04,350
Speaker 0: That is very possible.

173
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,032
Speaker 0: I think it will.

174
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:09,870
Speaker 0: My prediction is that Trigun fandom will resume, will basically meet its former peak.

175
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:17,670
Speaker 0: You know, Trigun will become as popular as it was when it was popular and then go back down again and then they will make, you know, some more money off of it.

176
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,395
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

177
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,030
Speaker 1: Go back down again is what I question.

178
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:27,450
Speaker 1: I wonder if because Trigun was really freaking popular and notice how even today, like anime cons, you still see the Wolfwood and the Vash cosplayers.

179
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:32,010
Speaker 1: You don't see as many Fullmetal Alchemist cosplayers until the new show came out.

180
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,770
Speaker 0: Trigun is a really, you know, good cosplay.

181
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,630
Speaker 0: You know, it has all the characteristics of what a good cosplay is all about.

182
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:44,264
Speaker 0: A character with a distinctive design, distinctive accoutrement, you know, it's.

183
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:46,650
Speaker 0: it's a, you know, recognizable character.

184
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,510
Speaker 0: It's like the perfect cosplay.

185
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,729
Speaker 0: So that is why it is frequent.

186
00:08:50,590 --> 00:09:00,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, I wonder if I mean, basically, if the movie does really well, I would expect there to be another movie or an OAV or even another TV show at some point.

187
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:14,350
Speaker 1: I think this is going to be the chance, because remember at Otacon, when the director they were talking about how Trigun was very not popular in Japan and crazy popular in the rest of the world to the point that it made a lot of money because of the rest of the world.

188
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:23,630
Speaker 1: And remember the very specific thing he said, we're making the Trigun movie for Trigun fans, not anime fans, not Japanese fans, Trigun fans.

189
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,790
Speaker 0: I just hope that it is not like the manga, because even though I have a Trigun fan and the manga is terrible, there's no question about it.

190
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,208
Speaker 1: Terrible isn't really the right word.

191
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,588
Speaker 1: Incomprehensible.

192
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,789
Speaker 1: I can't say it's terrible because I can't tell.

193
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,927
Speaker 1: I have no idea what's going on.

194
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,230
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, in the early volumes, you can sort of tell what's going on, but I have all the volumes.

195
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,950
Speaker 0: I should actually try to finish the finish.

196
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:47,358
Speaker 1: It doesn't end.

197
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,669
Speaker 1: It just kind of loops.

198
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,989
Speaker 1: It maybe just repeats like 10 pages in a row.

199
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,748
Speaker 1: Would you even notice?

200
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,431
Speaker 0: I don't know.

201
00:09:55,074 --> 00:10:04,050
Speaker 1: But yeah, there's going to be a little Trigun manga that's going to kind of build up to the April 24th opening of Trigun Badlands Rumble.

202
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:08,790
Speaker 1: And in case anyone doesn't know, the Trigun movie is basically the Cowboy Bebop movie.

203
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,894
Speaker 1: It takes place after all.

204
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:18,810
Speaker 1: the basic plot is set up in Trigun the TV show, but then before stuff happens, before world affecting stuff ruins everything.

205
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:31,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that actually Trigun would probably do better with a movie more similar to the Escaflowne movie, where you take these characters in this world that everyone likes and then you just tell a different story in it.

206
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:34,569
Speaker 0: that has nothing to do with the main story and it's not in the same universe.

207
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:43,290
Speaker 1: It's hard to say because they're doing this whole Vash versus Wolfwood thing with the movie, but all indications are that the movie is like the Cowboy Bebop movie.

208
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,529
Speaker 1: It's basically a standalone.

209
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,369
Speaker 1: You could just watch it having no idea.

210
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,049
Speaker 0: Well, it's got to be that you can't make a movie if you don't do that.

211
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,790
Speaker 1: One Piece 6.

212
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,029
Speaker 0: That's the One Piece movies as far as I know.

213
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:55,650
Speaker 0: I could be wrong, right?

214
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:03,410
Speaker 0: But from what I understand, which is probably wrong, they are not actually episodes that they are like, you know, compilations.

215
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,129
Speaker 0: So you could watch all the One Piece movies.

216
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:08,110
Speaker 0: And not watch any One Piece TV show and you would get the same thing.

217
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,709
Speaker 0: Is that wrong?

218
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,830
Speaker 0: Or do you have to watch the One Piece TV show and watch the movies in the correct spots?

219
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,210
Speaker 1: I've never seen one.

220
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,929
Speaker 1: I don't know if I ever planned to see one.

221
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,030
Speaker 0: Or are the One Piece movies side stories?

222
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,670
Speaker 0: I almost think I might like a One Piece movie, actually.

223
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,928
Speaker 0: Like maybe I should just watch all of them because...

224
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,230
Speaker 1: The fight can't last more than an hour and a half.

225
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:26,810
Speaker 0: Exactly.

226
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,890
Speaker 0: There'll be fight scenes, but the fights won't take up the whole movie.

227
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:33,930
Speaker 0: It'll be, you know, a contained story with a beginning, middle and an end within the movie itself.

228
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,030
Speaker 0: And it'll have all the One Piece characters.

229
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:38,270
Speaker 0: And, you know, I just I just wonder.

230
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should watch one of these movies.

231
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,190
Speaker 0: Well, maybe we should watch like the first One Piece movie and the second one.

232
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,548
Speaker 0: And then we'll be able to tell from that because I've seen like five or six episodes of One Piece and I've read 11 volumes.

233
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:54,370
Speaker 0: So if I watch the first two movies, that will probably give me a good idea.

234
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,890
Speaker 1: You know, along those lines, I feel like you realize I've never actually seen the Pokemon movie, not even the first one.

235
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:02,090
Speaker 0: I've never seen any Pokemon movie ever.

236
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,329
Speaker 1: I think we should watch the first Pokemon movie.

237
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:04,987
Speaker 0: The first one?

238
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, with Mewtwo and Mew, I think.

239
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,550
Speaker 0: Is that the one where you can't Snorlax can't live?

240
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:10,547
Speaker 1: It's got to be.

241
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:11,167
Speaker 0: Is it?

242
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:11,865
Speaker 0: I don't know.

243
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:12,546
Speaker 0: I don't know.

244
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,330
Speaker 0: Someone tell me which one that was.

245
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,268
Speaker 0: That's the one I want to watch.

246
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,269
Speaker 1: Snorlax helping everybody.

247
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,210
Speaker 0: OK, are we good on this?

248
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's, I guess, all the anime news in the world.

249
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:26,810
Speaker 1: that matters.

250
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,810
Speaker 1: I mean, if you're going to be at soccer account, I think they're going to premiere the dragon movie there.

251
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:31,410
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

252
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,810
Speaker 0: That's cool.

253
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'd better have it at Otacon.

254
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,049
Speaker 1: Jesus.

255
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,150
Speaker 0: So there's a comic book that I read that's relatively new and hot.

256
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,690
Speaker 0: The first trade paperback came out and I've talked about it on the Internet and on Scott's box.

257
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,010
Speaker 0: But I don't know if I've talked about it on geek nights.

258
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:49,849
Speaker 0: And if I haven't, now I am.

259
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,930
Speaker 0: And if I have, it's good enough to be worth talking about twice.

260
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:53,468
Speaker 0: All right.

261
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:54,710
Speaker 0: It's called The Unwritten.

262
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,289
Speaker 0: It's published by Vertigo.

263
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:59,610
Speaker 0: And it's written by Mike Carey with art from Peter Gross.

264
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:07,050
Speaker 0: And basically what this comic is about is pretend that Harry Potter was written by a dude.

265
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,369
Speaker 0: That dude.

266
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,389
Speaker 1: So Harry grabs, grasps his wang and.

267
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:13,004
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

268
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,510
Speaker 0: That dude who wrote the author of Harry Potter disappeared mysteriously.

269
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,608
Speaker 0: No one knows where he is.

270
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:19,530
Speaker 1: Right.

271
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:19,899
Speaker 1: All right.

272
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:21,408
Speaker 0: He has a son.

273
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,610
Speaker 0: The son's name is Harry Potter.

274
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:24,590
Speaker 0: It's a coincidence.

275
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,210
Speaker 0: Right.

276
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,130
Speaker 0: He's not really Harry Potter.

277
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,209
Speaker 0: It's just the dude's son.

278
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,350
Speaker 0: The dude made a series of Harry Potter like novels.

279
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,730
Speaker 0: And then he made he named the main character the same name as his son.

280
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:37,230
Speaker 1: I think I've looked at this, but I have not read it yet.

281
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:38,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll give it to you.

282
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:45,310
Speaker 0: And basically this guy, you know, is now this guy who is the Harry Potter, even though his name is not Harry Potter.

283
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,490
Speaker 0: His name is Tom Taylor.

284
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,950
Speaker 0: Right.

285
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,970
Speaker 0: So Tom Taylor, the real dude who has no magical powers whatsoever.

286
00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:04,970
Speaker 0: He's just basically making a living by going to conventions and signing autographs and, you know, doing that sort of thing, because, you know, imagine if there was a real dude named Harry Potter and he was the son of whatever that lady's name is, you know, he would go.

287
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,209
Speaker 0: He would be like a famous people.

288
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:06,799
Speaker 1: J.K.

289
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:07,149
Speaker 1: Rowling.

290
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:07,566
Speaker 1: Yeah.

291
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,192
Speaker 0: If it was J.K.

292
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,948
Speaker 0: Rowling's son and his name was Harry Potter, people would be like, oh, my gosh, whoo.

293
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,190
Speaker 0: And he'd be able to sign autographs and conventions and make a living on his own without even doing anything talented whatsoever.

294
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:18,350
Speaker 1: Just like Will Wheaton.

295
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,564
Speaker 0: No, OK, OK.

296
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,310
Speaker 0: So so this guy is at a convention, a nerdy convention, and he's doing a panel as people do.

297
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:26,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

298
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,723
Speaker 0: And some lady stands up in the audience, some girl, and she's just like.

299
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,650
Speaker 0: so she has a question.

300
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,647
Speaker 0: She says, who are you?

301
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,527
Speaker 0: And he's like, Tom Taylor, what's you know?

302
00:14:37,856 --> 00:14:38,830
Speaker 0: So she's like, no, really.

303
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,390
Speaker 0: Like your social security number is actually the security number of this person who died a long time ago.

304
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:46,409
Speaker 0: And he's like, he's just like, I don't know.

305
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:47,927
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

306
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:55,467
Speaker 0: And she presents all this evidence and it's mad conspiracy theory evidence, you know, but and he's just like, OK.

307
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,169
Speaker 0: And his agent basically hustles him out of there.

308
00:14:59,373 --> 00:14:59,787
Speaker 0: All right.

309
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:07,890
Speaker 0: And the thing is, basically, you get the idea that, yeah, he really isn't Tom Taylor, but he doesn't know it.

310
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,470
Speaker 0: It's like he's an identity thief impersonating someone, but he didn't set it up.

311
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,649
Speaker 0: He thinks he's Tom Taylor.

312
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:15,227
Speaker 0: He has no idea that.

313
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:15,990
Speaker 0: Right.

314
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,409
Speaker 0: So it's like, what the fuck is up?

315
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:19,509
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

316
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,530
Speaker 0: And then there's some supernatural shit.

317
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,028
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

318
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:22,888
Speaker 0: And it's pretty cool.

319
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,529
Speaker 1: Is it a series or a one piece?

320
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:25,570
Speaker 0: It's a series.

321
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,527
Speaker 0: So I got the first trade, which has issues one through five, I think.

322
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,610
Speaker 0: And then, you know, they come up with issues and trade.

323
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,570
Speaker 0: So I'll probably almost definitely get the second trade.

324
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,830
Speaker 0: And this is, you know, it's pretty amazing because, you know, it's a very original story.

325
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,069
Speaker 0: I've never read a story quite like this.

326
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,309
Speaker 0: It's also high quality, very suspenseful, very good.

327
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:50,710
Speaker 0: Mystery with a good pacing of reveals or a sour teas cock motherfucker.

328
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:52,360
Speaker 0: Right.

329
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:57,500
Speaker 0: The art is high quality and it's got lots of.

330
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:07,573
Speaker 0: you know, it ties in heavily to literacy, you know, literary works of the past and literary geography like, oh, you know, that's the.

331
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:08,390
Speaker 0: you know, they're in London.

332
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,110
Speaker 0: So it's like, oh, that's the building that was in Dickens something, something.

333
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,452
Speaker 0: And that's the building that, you know, is in 1984.

334
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,570
Speaker 0: You know, that's a very big part of it as well.

335
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:21,950
Speaker 0: So, you know, it doesn't it sort of, you know, goes off like that.

336
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,088
Speaker 0: And I enjoy it.

337
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:27,330
Speaker 0: And if you are a comic reading person, you should read the unwritten.

338
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,890
Speaker 1: God, this sounds so up our friend Scott Johnson's alley.

339
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,310
Speaker 0: No, it's almost painful.

340
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,750
Speaker 1: He's, you know, he's a big fan of the book of magic.

341
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's Neil Gaiman's Harry Potter.

342
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:39,775
Speaker 0: Yeah.

343
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,050
Speaker 0: That was out before Harry Potter.

344
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:41,311
Speaker 1: Yeah.

345
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:44,590
Speaker 1: But I have a feeling people who like one would like the other.

346
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,377
Speaker 0: I don't know.

347
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:47,590
Speaker 1: I get this impression.

348
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:47,973
Speaker 1: I don't know.

349
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,750
Speaker 1: I'm just basing that on almost nothing.

350
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

351
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,610
Speaker 0: No, I'll give you the book.

352
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,072
Speaker 0: You can read it.

353
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,929
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is a high quality new comic book.

354
00:16:55,371 --> 00:17:02,244
Speaker 0: Go buy it at the store so that they don't cancel it and stop making new issues, because that would be like, you know, I mean, I don't.

355
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:05,050
Speaker 0: I'm not one of those people who goes crazy upset when they cancel something.

356
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,214
Speaker 0: But it's like.

357
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:10,292
Speaker 0: I need enough issues to come out so that they can tell me what the deal is.

358
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,710
Speaker 1: But I thought this wasn't a charity.

359
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:13,148
Speaker 0: It's not.

360
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:18,470
Speaker 0: You know, buy it because it's awesome, not because you're, you know, thinking charity of it.

361
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:39,920
Speaker 1: So things of the day, I got to admit, as I finally start reading Astro Toy on a regular basis, I'm surprised to find that there's a new guy doing it as of this most recent Astro Toy.

362
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,008
Speaker 0: Is Krauser still in it?

363
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:42,440
Speaker 1: There was no Krauser.

364
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,820
Speaker 1: However, I can understand why there would be no Krauser.

365
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,120
Speaker 1: I mean, you wouldn't want Krauser to get hurt when you're reviewing Duke Togo himself.

366
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:50,865
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

367
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,220
Speaker 1: Remember way back on the show, I talked about this.

368
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,880
Speaker 1: It's the Duke Togo figure and the Figma.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,205
Speaker 0: Right.

370
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:56,470
Speaker 0: Yes.

371
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:56,654
Speaker 0: Yeah.

372
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,999
Speaker 1: It's my thing of the day for two reasons.

373
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:01,064
Speaker 1: OK.

374
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:04,420
Speaker 1: One, I did not realize that he comes with not one, but two suitcases.

375
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:14,299
Speaker 1: One has all the pieces, all the spaces in foam for you to put the pieces of his gun that assembles on its own to the other suitcase is full of hundred dollar bills.

376
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:19,580
Speaker 1: And the real reason, though, he only has two faces.

377
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Speaker 1: You know, they have like the multiple faces on these things like smiling, Yotsuba and sad Yotsuba, something like that.

378
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,658
Speaker 1: Maybe they have four faces.

379
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,100
Speaker 1: Duke Togo has two faces, normal Duke Togo and slightly sneering Duke Togo.

380
00:18:33,084 --> 00:18:34,420
Speaker 1: It's a beautiful thing to behold.

381
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,449
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

382
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,440
Speaker 0: Oh, Astro Toy under new management, Figma Deluxe, Golgo 13.

384
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,578
Speaker 1: That's David Cabrera.

385
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:45,819
Speaker 0: Oh, man, that is really deluxe.

386
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:51,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I told you, look at that thing, though, I was surprised to find out that room in the fit in the set.

387
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,683
Speaker 1: That was like a hotel room with an exhausted hooker and a window paper craft, not plastic.

388
00:18:57,225 --> 00:19:00,036
Speaker 1: Oh, he talks a lot about how he basically could not.

389
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:00,900
Speaker 0: he did something funny.

390
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:01,384
Speaker 0: Look, go go.

391
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,160
Speaker 0: Thirteen's riding on some weird moe.

392
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,700
Speaker 1: I didn't say he didn't do anything funny.

393
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:06,200
Speaker 1: I said there was no Krauser.

394
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:06,888
Speaker 0: That's true.

395
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:07,520
Speaker 0: There's no Krauser.

396
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,879
Speaker 0: He does have the speech bubble, though.

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,361
Speaker 1: He does.

398
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:14,319
Speaker 1: Apparently there are two different versions of double exclamation point.

399
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:16,533
Speaker 0: This is a good toy.

400
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:16,998
Speaker 0: Looks like.

401
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I almost bought it when we were hanging out the other day.

402
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,386
Speaker 1: In the city, I just didn't.

403
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,419
Speaker 0: Maybe I should know what he can do with it.

404
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:23,619
Speaker 1: Put it somewhere.

405
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,440
Speaker 0: I would buy it if I was going to make stop motion animations with it.

406
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,759
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it sort of just takes up room and money.

407
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:30,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

408
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,472
Speaker 1: I could put it like with numerous.

409
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:33,175
Speaker 1: it's humorous.

410
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,096
Speaker 0: But like, you know, that's the same reason I didn't buy the Hokuto no Ken figure of the guy getting, you know, what and exploding because it's like.

411
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:41,980
Speaker 0: that's freaking awesome.

412
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:43,899
Speaker 0: And it's a great conversation piece.

413
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:44,987
Speaker 0: But what am I going to do with it?

414
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:46,920
Speaker 1: Well, my new policies look around the studio.

415
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:49,700
Speaker 1: I have the Jigen because I think he's awesome.

416
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,406
Speaker 1: Just kind of there.

417
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:51,959
Speaker 1: I got my little house name, Miku.

418
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:53,388
Speaker 1: I got my Lupin.

419
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:55,260
Speaker 1: I don't really have that much else.

420
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,943
Speaker 1: I only have like the super high quality, very, very good figures in like key places around the house.

421
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:05,299
Speaker 1: The same way a welcome to my country home person is going to have the welcome to my country home device.

422
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,104
Speaker 0: All my toys are still in plastic bags on the floor of my bedroom, except for the Gundam models.

423
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,180
Speaker 1: You see, I had a day of reckoning when we moved.

424
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,720
Speaker 1: I actually went through all my little figures and put all the ones that weren't totally awesome away.

425
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,820
Speaker 0: Maybe what I'll do is I'll take out all the ones that I really just couldn't bear to get rid of and put them somewhere and all the other ones.

426
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,462
Speaker 1: I'll give away conventions or something, something I give them or anime Boston swap me.

427
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,460
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

428
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:33,962
Speaker 0: I forgot.

429
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,340
Speaker 0: After the thing today, we'll discuss that a little bit more.

430
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,240
Speaker 0: So I saw this video.

431
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:40,660
Speaker 0: It was all over the Internet today.

432
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:41,840
Speaker 0: You've probably seen it already.

433
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:43,295
Speaker 0: But in case you haven't, now you have.

434
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:44,829
Speaker 1: Well, they haven't.

435
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:45,720
Speaker 1: They don't know what it is yet.

436
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,146
Speaker 0: They will soon.

437
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:52,240
Speaker 0: The title of the video is Every Day Looper, less ramens.

438
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,860
Speaker 0: And I don't think it's about ramen, the food, though it might be.

439
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,425
Speaker 0: It's in French.

440
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:57,880
Speaker 0: I have no idea what he's saying.

441
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,940
Speaker 1: The words were something about eating something.

442
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:01,893
Speaker 0: Really?

443
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:02,139
Speaker 1: Yeah.

444
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:03,484
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

445
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,651
Speaker 1: That's that's about.

446
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,060
Speaker 0: that makes it even more awesome.

447
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,980
Speaker 1: That's about the extent of my knowledge of French.

448
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,239
Speaker 0: Basically, this is French kid.

449
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,920
Speaker 0: He looks, you know, younger than us, but older than a punk kid.

450
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,039
Speaker 1: He might be gave a qua.

451
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:14,847
Speaker 0: Yeah.

452
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:15,719
Speaker 0: Oh, you're right.

453
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,266
Speaker 1: The accent was kind of funny.

454
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:17,810
Speaker 1: It was kind of.

455
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,280
Speaker 1: it was kind of like a Señor God.

456
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,758
Speaker 0: Regardless, he has an iPhone just like me and he's got just like you, just like me.

457
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:26,339
Speaker 0: And it's it's hooked up.

458
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,702
Speaker 0: He's got some, you know, plug hooked up to his headphone hole with some wires coming out.

459
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,758
Speaker 0: I got to figure out what that is so I can get it.

460
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:36,320
Speaker 0: And he's got this app called Everyday Looper.

461
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,420
Speaker 0: And basically all this program does, it gives you four loops.

462
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:40,242
Speaker 0: Right.

463
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:41,479
Speaker 0: And you can make music with it.

464
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,303
Speaker 0: So you can be like.

465
00:21:42,504 --> 00:21:46,571
Speaker 0: you record on the first loop and you go, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

466
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:47,059
Speaker 0: All right.

467
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:48,599
Speaker 0: And then you record in the second loop.

468
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,462
Speaker 0: You're whistling, you know.

469
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:52,030
Speaker 0: Right.

470
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:53,950
Speaker 0: And then you got them both playing at once.

471
00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:00,334
Speaker 0: You know, that's and basically allows you to do on the fly, you know, music sampling and creation.

472
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:04,292
Speaker 0: And then it even gives you ways to like save the file and get it out of the phone.

473
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:11,110
Speaker 0: It actually has a Web server you can use to visit the Web server in the phone and get the file out, which is pretty neat anyway.

474
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:17,853
Speaker 0: So he, you know, in this YouTube video, he makes live in the video a pretty awesome song.

475
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,690
Speaker 0: So awesome that his video is passed all around the Internet's.

476
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,574
Speaker 0: And he was so awesome.

477
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:24,872
Speaker 0: I paid five dollars for this app because it's that one thing I can say.

478
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:25,716
Speaker 1: And I think you'll agree.

479
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:28,750
Speaker 1: he makes it look like it's really easy to do this.

480
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,910
Speaker 1: Not that easy.

481
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,950
Speaker 0: Also, you know, you have to do it in a place that's quiet.

482
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:37,350
Speaker 0: And that plug with the wires he has connected to it is helping him out.

483
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,473
Speaker 1: Oh, you need that.

484
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:44,810
Speaker 0: You definitely have to have a real microphone trying to do it with like, you know, just holding it up to your head like it's a telephone.

485
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,069
Speaker 0: Not too easy to do.

486
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,729
Speaker 0: It's going to sound like crap, you know, garbage and garbage out.

487
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:54,470
Speaker 1: So the meta minute, remember, before we forget.

488
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:56,790
Speaker 1: OK, it's coming up on Con season.

489
00:22:57,372 --> 00:23:01,370
Speaker 1: We try to avoid talking about conventions where the season is usually heavy.

490
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:02,581
Speaker 0: August this year.

491
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:03,490
Speaker 0: It's like equal.

492
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,889
Speaker 0: It's like March, August, well, March, April, August, because it's over the March, April squishiness.

493
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,510
Speaker 1: Well, because remember, we used to go to what?

494
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,907
Speaker 1: Well, we had Katsucon in February and fail.

495
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,650
Speaker 1: Then we had a long break and then it was like May, July, August, oh, shit.

496
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,315
Speaker 1: And then we're dead.

497
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:20,109
Speaker 1: And then we ended everything with Pax.

498
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:25,190
Speaker 1: But now there's two Pax's and we dropped Katsucon because of all the fail.

499
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,530
Speaker 1: And we consolidated, moved around and now we get Anime Boston.

500
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:39,350
Speaker 0: So basically our conventions are Pax East, Anime Boston, Otacon, Pax West, New York Comic Con, New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival combo and Kinetic Con.

501
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:42,610
Speaker 1: And, you know, like Zenkai Con because our friends were on it and stuff like that.

502
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,320
Speaker 0: Oh right, the Zenkai Con.

503
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:43,908
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

504
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:44,615
Speaker 0: But that's easy.

505
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:45,241
Speaker 1: I don't know.

506
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:46,130
Speaker 1: It's easy to do, though.

507
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:47,444
Speaker 1: Anyway, when was it last year?

508
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:47,950
Speaker 1: You don't remember?

509
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:48,382
Speaker 0: No, no.

510
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,856
Speaker 1: When did we do it?

511
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,570
Speaker 1: more or less than six months ago?

512
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:53,434
Speaker 0: I don't know.

513
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:56,250
Speaker 1: So are we that old?

514
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:59,129
Speaker 0: I was not living in New York at the time.

515
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,230
Speaker 1: It wasn't cold.

516
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:03,300
Speaker 0: It wasn't that cold.

517
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,863
Speaker 0: You're right.

518
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,709
Speaker 0: It was sunny out.

519
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

520
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,748
Speaker 0: Could have been fall, though.

521
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,495
Speaker 1: How did we get?

522
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:09,409
Speaker 1: I think we took your car.

523
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,809
Speaker 0: We did take my car because he had board games in it and such.

524
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:17,930
Speaker 1: And we watched the Prince of Tennis musical.

525
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,572
Speaker 0: That's right.

526
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:21,890
Speaker 0: OK, so this meant a minute.

527
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,029
Speaker 0: We got to remind Pax East is at the end of this month.

528
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,790
Speaker 1: It is like March the last weekend in March.

529
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,290
Speaker 1: So March 26, the schedule is now available.

530
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,430
Speaker 0: We are doing for three and a half, three and one asterisk panel.

531
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:37,813
Speaker 1: Yes.

532
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,330
Speaker 1: Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

533
00:24:39,632 --> 00:24:42,009
Speaker 1: Losing should be fun beyond Candyland.

534
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:50,070
Speaker 0: Fanatical devotion to the pope and Action Castle, which is actually Jared Sorenson, not us, but it doesn't matter.

535
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,089
Speaker 0: It's Action Castle.

536
00:24:51,352 --> 00:24:53,010
Speaker 1: And remember, Action Castle is us.

537
00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:00,870
Speaker 1: One Action Castle is going to be one of the best things at Pax East, which is saying a lot action castle.

538
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,828
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to say it any other way than that.

539
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:04,888
Speaker 1: But more, you know, no one could see what you were doing.

540
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,928
Speaker 1: No, we're not doing a video show yet.

541
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,148
Speaker 0: We'll have to do it.

542
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:11,710
Speaker 0: I wonder if we could do Action Castle on Ustream.

543
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:12,554
Speaker 0: Some.

544
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:13,625
Speaker 0: But how would people line up?

545
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:16,159
Speaker 1: We'll figure that out.

546
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:17,349
Speaker 0: I'll try it.

547
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,708
Speaker 1: We assign everyone a number.

548
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:20,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then no one else.

549
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:27,209
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll look at the list of participants in the chat room and I'll only pay attention to the person who's next in the list.

550
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:29,809
Speaker 1: Or you just pay attention to whatever gets typed next.

551
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,689
Speaker 0: No, because they would flood.

552
00:25:32,992 --> 00:25:36,849
Speaker 1: And then the game, you crash and you force the people to self-organize.

553
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:38,570
Speaker 1: And you had this meta element.

554
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,870
Speaker 1: Anyway, Action Castle will probably only take half of the panel time.

555
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,748
Speaker 1: Last Pax, the other half of that panel, me, Scott and Jared did a cut.

556
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:48,834
Speaker 1: It was weird.

557
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:50,124
Speaker 1: We did this like ad hoc Q&A.

558
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:53,330
Speaker 1: And we I've noticed this before.

559
00:25:53,591 --> 00:26:02,170
Speaker 1: Whenever we've done the kind of panels at the last minute, like when we did that Advanced Wars panel at Otacon that one year again, we are not experts at Advanced Wars.

560
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,810
Speaker 1: You know, we're just some guys who Otacon is like, we need another panel.

561
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,348
Speaker 1: We're like, we'll do one on.

562
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:09,129
Speaker 1: How about Advanced Wars?

563
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,570
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I mean, we gave them so many suggestions.

564
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:16,510
Speaker 0: Advanced Wars, which is the most crab people of all of them, is the one they picked over many better choices.

565
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we did it.

566
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:29,730
Speaker 1: And people, because we were at the front of the room sitting behind a table with microphones, people asked us the kind of questions that they would they should be asking, like the guy who made Advanced Wars.

567
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, I don't know why you asking me.

568
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:35,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't write the code.

569
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:37,103
Speaker 1: But the same thing happened here.

570
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:38,050
Speaker 1: Like we're just three schmucks.

571
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,847
Speaker 1: I mean, no one in the audience really knew who we were.

572
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,809
Speaker 1: Action Castle was for that, like the second time in a row, the secret event at Pax.

573
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:46,649
Speaker 0: It's now it's not a secret anymore.

574
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:47,635
Speaker 0: We're going to.

575
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:49,470
Speaker 0: it's going to be so unsecret this time.

576
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,968
Speaker 0: You know, you know, it's going to be secret, though.

577
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,610
Speaker 0: Jungle adventure is going to be the secret event.

578
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,403
Speaker 1: There may well be a secret event.

579
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:56,069
Speaker 1: I'm working on that.

580
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,488
Speaker 1: But instead of secret, everybody is paying me for the door.

581
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,274
Speaker 0: All right.

582
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:04,138
Speaker 1: So but not.

583
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:06,168
Speaker 1: but we basically just did this Q&A.

584
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:07,380
Speaker 1: And who are we?

585
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,250
Speaker 1: Three schmucks.

586
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,370
Speaker 1: People ask us some pretty crazy questions and seem really interested in the answers.

587
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,790
Speaker 0: So I don't know if we'll be doing, you know, technically it's Jared's panel.

588
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,429
Speaker 0: Like, go let him go full on.

589
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:26,209
Speaker 1: What I want to do is I want Jared and Luke Crane to do at least the mini version of their games as mind control panel that Pax didn't want for some reason.

590
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can do.

591
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:29,469
Speaker 0: I got some stuff to say about some related topics.

592
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:30,097
Speaker 1: Yeah.

593
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:31,049
Speaker 1: So we'll figure something out.

594
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,709
Speaker 1: So something will happen next Tuesday show.

595
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:33,194
Speaker 1: Yes.

596
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,650
Speaker 1: Action Castle is going to be crazy.

597
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,342
Speaker 1: Something else is going to happen after Action Castle.

598
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:38,830
Speaker 1: that will also be crazy.

599
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:43,650
Speaker 1: And if enough of you are at Pax East, I know we have more East Coast listeners than West Coast listeners.

600
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:46,629
Speaker 1: We'll make something additional cool happen at some point.

601
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,530
Speaker 0: And Anime Boston go to it.

602
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,150
Speaker 0: It's going to be an awesome anime convention.

603
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,990
Speaker 1: April 2nd and 3rd and 4th, the weekend directly after Pax East in the same building.

604
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,570
Speaker 0: Nobu Uematsu is going to be there.

605
00:27:58,891 --> 00:27:59,336
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

606
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:00,489
Speaker 0: That Nobu.

607
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,248
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is in music by Nobu.

608
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,270
Speaker 0: I don't know what Otakon is going to do to compete with.

609
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:06,833
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.

610
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,010
Speaker 1: Your staff, you know exactly who Otakon has.

611
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's not going to be.

612
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,170
Speaker 0: it's not being that doesn't beat Nobu.

613
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:14,770
Speaker 0: I mean, that's great, but it doesn't.

614
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:15,498
Speaker 1: Here's the trouble.

615
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,510
Speaker 1: Here's the one difference.

616
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,249
Speaker 1: If it's someone like Yokokano, like when Otakon had Yokokano way back, that beats Nobu.

617
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,790
Speaker 1: Yokokano is both crazy amazing in the Nobu sense and can perform herself.

618
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,331
Speaker 1: Yep.

619
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:29,710
Speaker 1: I don't believe Nobu is going to perform.

620
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,557
Speaker 0: That's correct.

621
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,529
Speaker 1: He's going to talk.

622
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,489
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter now.

623
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,440
Speaker 1: Maybe he's going to bring.

624
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,290
Speaker 1: I don't know this part.

625
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,070
Speaker 1: They don't tell us lowly staffers this.

626
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,733
Speaker 1: I don't know.

627
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,310
Speaker 1: Maybe he's going to have an orchestra.

628
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:39,370
Speaker 0: The thing is right.

629
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,230
Speaker 0: Nobu is such a great composer.

630
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:44,250
Speaker 0: I imagine he has the ability to play instruments.

631
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's got.

632
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:47,050
Speaker 1: most composers can play the piano.

633
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:47,695
Speaker 1: OK.

634
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:48,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

635
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:48,464
Speaker 1: Yeah.

636
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,561
Speaker 0: It's you know, so he can definitely do something.

637
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,350
Speaker 0: regardless is Nobu.

638
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,010
Speaker 0: And it's right now it's looking like anime.

639
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,425
Speaker 0: Boston is like ahead of Otakon when you look at, you know, Nobu.

640
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,110
Speaker 0: It's like, well, anime Boston is currently winning on the scorecard.

641
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,650
Speaker 1: Well, I think the reason is and this is going to be really, really meta.

642
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,370
Speaker 1: It's the meta minutes.

643
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,288
Speaker 1: The only time I can get away with saying stuff like this.

644
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,329
Speaker 1: Otakon way back used to give panelists and like people who did stuff weird special treatment like most kinds of most kinds of your panelists.

645
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:18,410
Speaker 1: They give you something.

646
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,530
Speaker 1: Otakon kind of stopped doing that over the years.

647
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,710
Speaker 1: Like we have to actually wait in lines and do all the same stuff.

648
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,649
Speaker 1: Normal people do it.

649
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:25,481
Speaker 1: Otakon anime Boston.

650
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:26,589
Speaker 1: We kind of don't.

651
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:29,850
Speaker 1: So we have this really skewed perspective.

652
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:30,730
Speaker 1: Like we didn't have to worry.

653
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,150
Speaker 1: Are we going to get into the concert in anime Boston?

654
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:35,070
Speaker 1: We basically just walked in and sat in the front.

655
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:36,725
Speaker 1: I don't know if we were supposed to.

656
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:37,962
Speaker 0: We didn't sit in the front.

657
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:38,510
Speaker 0: We sat in the middle.

658
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,890
Speaker 1: We sat in the front ish of like that middle area.

659
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:42,829
Speaker 1: We didn't stand in that crazy line.

660
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:43,818
Speaker 0: That's true.

661
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:44,630
Speaker 0: We didn't stand in the line.

662
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,290
Speaker 0: We just walked in and it just we happened to walk in and we sat at the, you know, far the, you know, empty seats.

663
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,850
Speaker 0: We didn't go to reserve seating area.

664
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,030
Speaker 0: We just didn't wait in line.

665
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we saw and there's other stuff like that.

666
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,810
Speaker 1: I think we might have a skewed perception.

667
00:29:56,991 --> 00:30:00,970
Speaker 1: So I'd take anything we say about comparisons between Otakon and anime Boston.

668
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:07,070
Speaker 0: You're saying that because anime Boston gives more perks with a grain of salt, that we may be biased towards anime Boston.

669
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:13,406
Speaker 0: Yes, it might be true because we see also because anime Boston goes late with the hotel space.

670
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:13,890
Speaker 0: Yes.

671
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,290
Speaker 0: There's more anime Boston and they also had a gaming room in there.

672
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,865
Speaker 1: So it's like, yeah, we have a really weird and skewed perception between the two kinds.

673
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:22,250
Speaker 0: That's true.

674
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,890
Speaker 0: But if you look at just the guest scorecard, anime Boston is winning.

675
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:27,470
Speaker 1: Depends if you scale that.

676
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,090
Speaker 1: Like if you look at the last several years, Lark, I'm talking about this year.

677
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, this year, but only Otakon's track record is still like far above.

678
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,550
Speaker 0: I did not say it was not.

679
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,930
Speaker 0: I said this year, so far, anime Boston guest scorecard.

680
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,950
Speaker 0: Nobu is worth so many points.

681
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,929
Speaker 0: Otakon is not winning on that, you know, row on the rubric.

682
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:47,553
Speaker 1: Yeah.

683
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:50,050
Speaker 1: The other factor, I think I didn't even think about this.

684
00:30:50,130 --> 00:31:00,710
Speaker 1: The hotel fact, because my favorite cons way back in the day used to be the hotel cons like Asen and Katsucon because they went all night and crazy stuff happened all night long.

685
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,690
Speaker 1: And Otakon was always weird.

686
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,262
Speaker 1: That was the con where, you know, the fire alarm went off and we all had to leave at two a.m..

687
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:06,929
Speaker 0: Everybody out.

688
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:14,863
Speaker 1: Of course, at the same time, I have not been kicked out of Otakon at the end of Otakon for like three years running because I'm an old man and I go to bed.

689
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:15,690
Speaker 0: That's right.

690
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,270
Speaker 1: So I don't know.

691
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,130
Speaker 1: But anime Boston is going to be frickin awesome.

692
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,890
Speaker 1: Pax East is going to be frickin awesome.

693
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:26,870
Speaker 1: And we're doing like four or five panels slash events at anime Boston.

694
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,930
Speaker 0: And don't and remember, I didn't know this anime Boston has a swap meet.

695
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:46,410
Speaker 0: So if you have mangas, DVDs, video games, board games, toys, any stuff that you want to get rid of and trade for other stuff, bring it to anime Boston, because I did not know they had a swap meet and I'm going to bring a whole bunch of stuff and trade it with me.

696
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,550
Speaker 0: And the thing that's weird is it seems like a lot of shit.

697
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,175
Speaker 1: I keep forgetting.

698
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:50,770
Speaker 1: we're swap me to Connecticut no matter what.

699
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:51,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't forget.

700
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:58,530
Speaker 0: It seems to me that like a lot of people at anime Boston go to the anime Boston forums and trade in advance.

701
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:00,909
Speaker 0: And I'm like, well, what's the point of a swap meet then?

702
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,290
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the point is that, you know, you right.

703
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:07,569
Speaker 0: So I'm not going to post anything in the anime Boston forums to show up with my stuff.

704
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:08,648
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

705
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:10,629
Speaker 1: Should we cosplay for that?

706
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,210
Speaker 1: Because I have a mission for all of you out there.

707
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:21,298
Speaker 1: If you show up to the swap meet dressed as either sand people with a little, you know, something like a little robe stuff on.

708
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:22,310
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

709
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:22,933
Speaker 1: And people are.

710
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:25,547
Speaker 1: And John was like, yeah.

711
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:25,748
Speaker 0: Yeah.

712
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:33,290
Speaker 1: Anyway, or if you dress as the shopkeeper from Secret of Mana or a shopkeeper from any video game, I don't know.

713
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:34,710
Speaker 0: I think I could dress as old man.

714
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,265
Speaker 0: I could be like that.

715
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:38,650
Speaker 1: Take anyone you want.

716
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,250
Speaker 1: Anyone you want, except Europa, too.

717
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,029
Speaker 0: Does anyone ever cosplayed as old man?

718
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:44,527
Speaker 0: I've never seen one.

719
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:47,730
Speaker 1: If you get two people to cosplay as the fires.

720
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:49,176
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

721
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:51,330
Speaker 1: Or one step further, you take it fully meta.

722
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,629
Speaker 1: You dress up as old man pimp with hot lady fire.

723
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:57,567
Speaker 1: Much like the old poke pimp.

724
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,630
Speaker 0: So if I dress up as old man pimp, who's going to be hot lady fires?

725
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,489
Speaker 1: We know we know enough hot ladies.

726
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:05,628
Speaker 0: We need two hot lady fires that want to be.

727
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,920
Speaker 0: They want to get pimped by me.

728
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:07,789
Speaker 1: I'll be the moblin.

729
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:11,410
Speaker 0: You could be called grumble, grumble, grumble, grumble.

730
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,789
Speaker 0: You could have the two fires also.

731
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,790
Speaker 0: We would share the fires, man.

732
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:16,120
Speaker 1: It's total aside.

733
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,150
Speaker 1: meta Emily's play.

734
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,030
Speaker 1: You know, I gave her she's playing final or final fantasy Zelda three.

735
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,990
Speaker 1: You know, one of the last Super Nintendo Zelda.

736
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,495
Speaker 1: Yeah.

737
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:23,470
Speaker 1: You know, the link to the past.

738
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,569
Speaker 1: One of the last kind of old school Zelda's.

739
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:27,710
Speaker 1: She had never played Zelda one.

740
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,840
Speaker 1: She did not know that grumble.

741
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:34,750
Speaker 1: grumble is literally solved by a stereotypical piece of meat on a bone.

742
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,390
Speaker 1: I showed her a picture of that meat.

743
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,010
Speaker 1: I was like, that is the item in the game.

744
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,720
Speaker 0: That's fucking.

745
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:40,330
Speaker 0: I love that meat.

746
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,710
Speaker 1: I love the fact that if you use it, it does something independent.

747
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,990
Speaker 1: I'm not really, you know, a octorox will go walking kind of stand over it.

748
00:33:48,112 --> 00:33:49,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not really.

749
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:50,008
Speaker 0: It's not as strong as it.

750
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,590
Speaker 0: You know, it's not like a magnet, you know, that's like super strong.

751
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,390
Speaker 0: It's just kind of it just kind of suggests to them to walk that.

752
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,769
Speaker 1: It'd be really useful, except, you know, who doesn't go after it?

753
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,129
Speaker 0: Those dangerous bad guys, fucking knights.

754
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,829
Speaker 0: No dangerous bad guy.

755
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,253
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:04,090
Speaker 0: Useful on the knights because they would all crowd around it.

757
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,949
Speaker 0: You just put a bomb on it.

758
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,729
Speaker 1: No, they just turn left right into me.

759
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,302
Speaker 0: I just like meat bomb.

760
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:08,725
Speaker 0: Boom.

761
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:09,129
Speaker 0: I win.

762
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,050
Speaker 0: But meat bomb meat bomb tricks knights.

763
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:14,550
Speaker 0: And do that's a great comic.

764
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,889
Speaker 0: You put down a meat, you show a blue knight walking over to it.

765
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,730
Speaker 0: Then he picks up the meat and it's like blue bomb pops out of it.

766
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:25,810
Speaker 0: Oh, it hits him in the front where, you know, it hits him in the back because, yeah, you can't.

767
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:26,429
Speaker 1: I just had this.

768
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:28,690
Speaker 1: I think my brain just went 4chan for a second.

769
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,748
Speaker 1: I picture the dongo saying something bad in me.

770
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:35,889
Speaker 1: That was like 10 things mashed.

771
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,478
Speaker 0: You can make a series of comics.

772
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:41,790
Speaker 0: like Link gets tricky with the meat bomb trick and you show link like sitting around the corner going.

773
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,322
Speaker 1: You know, that reminds me.

774
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:43,425
Speaker 1: Yeah.

775
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,168
Speaker 1: I wonder if high space is still there.

776
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:46,415
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

777
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:48,409
Speaker 1: I haven't checked that forever in high space.

778
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:48,976
Speaker 1: All right.

779
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:49,606
Speaker 1: Pause the show.

780
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:06,500
Speaker 1: Wow, that just reminded me how much I love high space.

781
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, it hasn't updated in years.

782
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,640
Speaker 0: Hasn't updated since 07.

783
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,700
Speaker 0: Does not understand why people enjoy old man attack.

784
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,920
Speaker 0: Have did setting up system of security with fire shooting.

785
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,320
Speaker 0: Yet people still try old man attack.

786
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:21,600
Speaker 0: This hurts old man's feelings.

787
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,100
Speaker 0: Wants to know the secret.

788
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,440
Speaker 0: After all, the secret I reveal is only right.

789
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,039
Speaker 1: I am to pop cap.

790
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,920
Speaker 1: You are as more like Shono to your maker, bitch.

791
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:30,706
Speaker 1: I am what?

792
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:32,760
Speaker 1: Oh, error.

793
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,659
Speaker 1: I love you almost as much as I love Bagu.

794
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:40,820
Speaker 0: If you are address typed in address bar, you are check if it is correct spelling.

795
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:46,540
Speaker 0: You are high space page of open and you are want links of information.

796
00:35:49,143 --> 00:35:51,779
Speaker 1: I know that Dodongo does not smoke.

797
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:59,480
Speaker 0: OK, so about me, I'm humble spectacle is an entrance to death.

798
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:01,611
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

799
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:02,980
Speaker 1: So are we done here?

800
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,886
Speaker 1: No more matter.

801
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:04,411
Speaker 0: We're done.

802
00:36:04,451 --> 00:36:05,239
Speaker 0: Let's get on with the show.

803
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,278
Speaker 1: So the other weekend, the Children's Film Festival in New York City, which gets international film festival.

804
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:12,480
Speaker 1: Yes.

805
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:19,379
Speaker 1: Which the thing I can say about it that always amazes me and almost bothers me a little bit every year.

806
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:28,320
Speaker 1: If you take like all the movies that are released and then you have a subset of that, all the movies I care about, most of them end up at the Children's Film Festival.

807
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:32,298
Speaker 0: I think that's because, you know, we care about animation more than we care about live actions.

808
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:32,620
Speaker 0: Right.

809
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,120
Speaker 0: And the Children's Film Festival is primarily animation.

810
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,990
Speaker 0: And what's really weird is they even show.

811
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,680
Speaker 0: they don't show hentai or anything.

812
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:45,055
Speaker 0: But there are some animations that they show that are like, hey, this should be for like 16 year olds and stuff.

813
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:45,820
Speaker 1: I disagree.

814
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,280
Speaker 1: I think that they show a lot of things that are just fine for very young kids.

815
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,959
Speaker 1: They're just they're kind of edgy and they're good.

816
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:56,498
Speaker 0: No, but they actually say in their program, like, you know, only 16 and up should watch this.

817
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,300
Speaker 0: So the other thing is that they all they show very few live action things.

818
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:02,420
Speaker 0: But those are for children.

819
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,120
Speaker 0: So I guess it is a children's film festival technically.

820
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:11,997
Speaker 0: But, you know, maybe they should, I don't know, may just give up and make it an animation film festival.

821
00:37:12,017 --> 00:37:12,420
Speaker 1: I don't know.

822
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,559
Speaker 1: But like you misspoke before, I think we need a children's film festival, too.

823
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,465
Speaker 0: No, we don't.

824
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,560
Speaker 0: And when did I misspeak?

825
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,280
Speaker 1: You said festival instead of festival.

826
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:20,859
Speaker 0: When did I say that?

827
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,380
Speaker 1: All I could picture was Hokuto Hirakuretsu Ken.

828
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,699
Speaker 0: I didn't I didn't say that.

829
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,610
Speaker 0: I don't remember saying it.

830
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,439
Speaker 0: You said festival.

831
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:30,900
Speaker 0: OK, that would not be appropriate for the festival.

832
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,440
Speaker 1: But we actually we went to one.

833
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:35,860
Speaker 1: You know, we usually go to like one thing.

834
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,511
Speaker 1: Last year I went with Emily and we watched.

835
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:38,699
Speaker 1: or was it two years ago?

836
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:39,185
Speaker 1: I forget.

837
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:40,279
Speaker 1: But the girl who lived through time.

838
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:45,080
Speaker 1: And this year we went to see Summer Wars, you know, Mamoru Hosoda's movie.

839
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,740
Speaker 0: The same guy who directed girl at the time.

840
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,059
Speaker 1: But this time Mamoru Hosoda was there.

841
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,859
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're really good at showing up at anime movies when the director is there in New York City.

842
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,499
Speaker 0: That seems to happen quite often.

843
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:57,599
Speaker 0: What's up with that?

844
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:01,099
Speaker 0: And also, every time we show up, all the same people are also there.

845
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,780
Speaker 1: I know, like errands there, you know, Ninja Consultants show up.

846
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,960
Speaker 1: Pizza Terrace there.

847
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:12,320
Speaker 0: It's like the New York anime community is like these same people and they just always show up to every New York anime event.

848
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:14,053
Speaker 0: And we're just like, hey, I know you.

849
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:14,798
Speaker 0: What's up?

850
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to review like the dinner gala afterward, though they had really good cookies.

851
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,280
Speaker 0: They had this the pizza.

852
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,851
Speaker 0: They got pizza from across the street.

853
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:22,900
Speaker 0: It was fucking awesome.

854
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:23,651
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

855
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:24,280
Speaker 1: I went downstairs.

856
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,720
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, wow, this gala is just pizza.

857
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,587
Speaker 1: Seriously.

858
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:28,359
Speaker 1: But then I ate the pizza.

859
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,478
Speaker 1: That was some of the best pizza.

860
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,405
Speaker 0: Yeah.

861
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:32,060
Speaker 0: And the place was directly across the street.

862
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,158
Speaker 0: So I know exactly where it is.

863
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,259
Speaker 0: So now I can go there and it's on the subway home so I can actually stop, get pizza on the way home, get back on the subway and go home.

864
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:47,619
Speaker 1: But the only thing I want to say about the whole gala and actually talking to him, I mean, you know, Emily talked to him kind of at length.

865
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:55,620
Speaker 1: And when they did the Q&A after the movie, he was very unlike a lot of other anime directors I've seen answering questions.

866
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,880
Speaker 1: He was so like, I'm a normal guy.

867
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,580
Speaker 1: It was almost disconcerting.

868
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:02,320
Speaker 0: He was just a really normal and friendly guy.

869
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,220
Speaker 0: He didn't give like strange answers.

870
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,511
Speaker 0: He didn't go, oh, oh, oh.

871
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:08,200
Speaker 1: It was like Ikuhara with all of his.

872
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:11,140
Speaker 1: Well, I couldn't tell you why Toga did that because I'm not Toga.

873
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,198
Speaker 1: So you'd have to ask him.

874
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Satoshi Kon was also sort of a normal, friendly guy.

875
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:19,059
Speaker 0: But, you know, he still had a little bit of that, you know, artist-ness to him.

876
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:25,919
Speaker 1: Though here's the thing and we realize this and I want to somehow tap this for anime conventions when we ask questions at panels.

877
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,720
Speaker 1: The Film Festival for Children had a lot of like five year olds asking questions, as opposed to, you know, bigger events where it's adults.

878
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:49,080
Speaker 0: It was about like, I would say, if you looked at the the demographics of people asking questions, it was like 40 percent children, 40 percent otaku and 20 percent, you know, others like adults who brought, you know, parents or, you know, whatever.

879
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:55,320
Speaker 1: There's something about little kids to where they ask the direct, obvious question that no adult ever thinks to ask.

880
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,057
Speaker 1: But yet everyone wants to know the answer to.

881
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:03,180
Speaker 1: And but but half the time their little kid brains just ask questions that don't.

882
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,820
Speaker 1: It's not like they're dumb questions.

883
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:06,420
Speaker 1: It's that it's not a question.

884
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,620
Speaker 1: It was a bunch of random words that this kid strung together.

885
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:12,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like half the kids ask these fucking great questions.

886
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,440
Speaker 1: Like, why did you call him love machine?

887
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,699
Speaker 1: And then I felt really stupid when he answered the question.

888
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, whoa, that's a great freaking question, little kid.

889
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:29,560
Speaker 0: And then the next kid will come up and be like, so in the Cosmo technology stuff, like literally, that's what the kid will just put a bunch of words and proper nouns in the movie together.

890
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:42,879
Speaker 1: And then he'll be like, or they'll preface their question with this big global statement, like in light of the fact that you were technology and there was a lot of something, something, something, something in the movie.

891
00:40:44,503 --> 00:40:44,926
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

892
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:46,800
Speaker 1: And then they wouldn't actually ask a question.

893
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:52,640
Speaker 1: And the translator would be like, I'm pretty sure the translator was saying to him, yeah, the kid didn't actually ask a question.

894
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,953
Speaker 1: Say something about Kim Cosmo.

895
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:54,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

896
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,959
Speaker 0: So and the thing is, the translator was pretty great.

897
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:58,500
Speaker 0: We got to I forget.

898
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,240
Speaker 0: I should have talked to her to be like, hey, give me your card.

899
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,860
Speaker 0: So we yes, we need you and we need a good translator.

900
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:07,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure Pete to terror got some information from her.

901
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:08,049
Speaker 0: I hope so.

902
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,435
Speaker 0: All right.

903
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:11,738
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I don't want to get it.

904
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,839
Speaker 0: That was like about the movie.

905
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,200
Speaker 1: Yes, the movie Summer Wars.

906
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:16,100
Speaker 1: And I can't stress this enough.

907
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,980
Speaker 1: We're not going to spoil anything till the very end of the show.

908
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,850
Speaker 1: Then we'll have a spoiler.

909
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,519
Speaker 0: Are you going to spoil it?

910
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,085
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

911
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:21,520
Speaker 0: We don't even really need to spoil it.

912
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:22,344
Speaker 1: Not really.

913
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:24,920
Speaker 1: We'll see if there's a if there's a spoiler line.

914
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:28,000
Speaker 1: I think there's a couple of things I want to spoil the very end.

915
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,740
Speaker 1: But don't even bother listening to this review.

916
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,609
Speaker 1: Just go see the movie.

917
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,500
Speaker 1: It's an anime movie.

918
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,120
Speaker 1: There aren't that many that are good even or that are in America.

919
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:36,761
Speaker 1: Legit.

920
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:40,080
Speaker 0: Also, I want to point out, you know, this is a Madhouse production.

921
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,738
Speaker 0: So she cons doing Madhouse hosted as doing Madhouse.

922
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,320
Speaker 0: Madhouse is like, I get on top of the anime world right now, basically.

923
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:48,800
Speaker 0: Not that they weren't before.

924
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,825
Speaker 1: Look at Hosanna.

925
00:41:49,886 --> 00:41:51,218
Speaker 1: He came out of the same kind of.

926
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:54,020
Speaker 1: you know, he's not one of those people who like director, director, director.

927
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,180
Speaker 1: He's key animator, key animator, key animator, key animator, director.

928
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,060
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, key animator is not in between.

929
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,920
Speaker 0: You know, it's like key animators.

930
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,199
Speaker 0: Basically, you are the real animator doing the real animation work.

931
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:09,440
Speaker 0: You know, you're drawing all the most important pictures.

932
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,260
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's not like he was a nobody.

933
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:15,560
Speaker 0: You know, he was doing all the real hard, important grunt work.

934
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:18,259
Speaker 0: And then he just kept doing it and kept doing it and kept doing it.

935
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:20,119
Speaker 0: And he made the connections and he networked.

936
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:24,280
Speaker 0: And then he got a directing job doing like a. did he do like Digimon movie?

937
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:25,679
Speaker 1: He did the Digimon movie.

938
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:26,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

939
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:28,140
Speaker 0: And then from there, it's like, well, you did Digimon movie.

940
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,014
Speaker 0: Now you can do real movies and now.

941
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:30,699
Speaker 0: All right, you're good.

942
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:31,563
Speaker 1: Yeah.

943
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:35,159
Speaker 1: And for anyone who doesn't know, he actually, you know, he did The Girl Left Through Time.

944
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:40,160
Speaker 1: He also did Superflat Monogram, which you can just find that like on YouTube.

945
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:40,844
Speaker 1: It's a short.

946
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:43,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's very Murakami.

947
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,139
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, Summer Wars is also very Murakami as well, even though I don't know if Murakami actually had a hand in it.

948
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,020
Speaker 0: But there was a lot of things that there is no debate that they are super flat.

949
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,700
Speaker 0: I think the world of Oz is super flat.

950
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,606
Speaker 0: There is no question.

951
00:42:56,646 --> 00:42:58,580
Speaker 1: I think Oz just really like Superflat.

952
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:58,842
Speaker 1: Yeah.

953
00:42:58,883 --> 00:42:59,268
Speaker 0: Why not?

954
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:00,119
Speaker 0: You know, it fits.

955
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,355
Speaker 1: I like Superflat.

956
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:01,640
Speaker 1: Yeah.

957
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,020
Speaker 0: I really only used it like in the Land of Oz or is incredibly appropriate.

958
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,660
Speaker 0: And he didn't use it like out in the you know, in the the rest of the movie.

959
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:10,620
Speaker 0: And it actually created this really nice contrast.

960
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:11,445
Speaker 1: It did.

961
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:12,900
Speaker 1: I enjoyed both parts equally.

962
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,360
Speaker 1: But anyway, the Summer Wars anime movie has a pretty good like hook plot.

963
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:26,860
Speaker 1: It's basically this cute girl, you know, high school drama, summer kind of typical anime movie comes into these two nerds who have this kind of they're doing their summer.

964
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,360
Speaker 0: Basically, yeah, their summer job is like taking care of like the virtual world.

965
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,940
Speaker 0: They're like, you know, they got like internships at the virtual world.

966
00:43:33,323 --> 00:43:35,040
Speaker 0: They're just doing like low level maintenance work.

967
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,840
Speaker 1: And she's like, I need someone to do a summer job for me.

968
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,498
Speaker 0: And they're like, we already have jobs.

969
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,240
Speaker 1: And she's like, you'll basically come with me in my grandparents house.

970
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:46,699
Speaker 0: And one guy's like, I'll do it.

971
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,820
Speaker 0: He's like, the other guys, they like fight over it.

972
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,656
Speaker 0: But he fight over it.

973
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:49,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

974
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:59,573
Speaker 1: Basically, she hires this guy to do some unspecified job with her and ends up taking him out into the mountains where her family lives in Ueda in a gigantic mansion.

975
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:00,599
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

976
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:02,539
Speaker 1: And the movie just escalates from there.

977
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:03,605
Speaker 0: Yeah.

978
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,360
Speaker 0: When I saw the trailer for the movie, right, I thought that it was.

979
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:08,680
Speaker 0: I didn't realize it was so much about technology.

980
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:16,960
Speaker 0: I thought it was going to be one of those like, you know, having fun in the country sort of summer can't feel good things, which appeals to me a lot.

981
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:22,220
Speaker 0: You know, I thought it was going to be like, you know, people playing flag football or whatever, you know, and having a good time in the summer.

982
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,867
Speaker 1: I didn't get that.

983
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:23,560
Speaker 1: I got this more.

984
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,356
Speaker 1: I don't want to say chocolate wars, but this kind of like.

985
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:27,603
Speaker 0: I didn't think it was like chocolate.

986
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:37,440
Speaker 1: No, but I expected this weird, like high level feeling conflict that occurs on a very low level among kids out with families.

987
00:44:38,402 --> 00:44:38,684
Speaker 0: I don't know.

988
00:44:38,824 --> 00:44:41,700
Speaker 0: But anyway, it did have some of that, though.

989
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:47,820
Speaker 0: It did have some of that, you know, go to, you know, hanging out in the, you know, in the country during the summer kind of feelings.

990
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,159
Speaker 0: And I like those feelings.

991
00:44:49,641 --> 00:44:51,620
Speaker 1: But the real plot is independently.

992
00:44:52,401 --> 00:45:00,244
Speaker 1: Imagine a future, a real future, you know, from this point where my space and wow and all these things kind of Facebook and Second Life make a baby.

993
00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:02,780
Speaker 0: And every single thing in the world is on that.

994
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:06,280
Speaker 0: People don't use websites or email like that is the Internet.

995
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:06,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

996
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,420
Speaker 0: This Facebook and Second Life had a baby.

997
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:09,205
Speaker 0: And that is it.

998
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:19,160
Speaker 0: Everyone just uses that on their cell phones, on their DSS, on their computers, on their TVs, everyone just, you know, telephones, interfaces directly through the Facebook Second Life thing.

999
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,619
Speaker 0: And they call it the land of Oz.

1000
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:30,235
Speaker 0: But that thing independently is super flat Murakami all the way, which is really weird because it's like there are banks doing business here and it looks like fucking Murakami.

1001
00:45:30,256 --> 00:45:30,700
Speaker 0: It's like, really?

1002
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,119
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can buy this, but I love how the movie opens with that whole like sequence about like, welcome to Oz, make your avatar.

1003
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:39,480
Speaker 1: They like make a couple of avatars, the little monkey.

1004
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:40,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1005
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:40,523
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1006
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:43,200
Speaker 1: And, you know, they show you a lot about this world.

1007
00:45:43,721 --> 00:45:47,900
Speaker 1: There are so many different, like crazily different, cool avatars.

1008
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:50,093
Speaker 1: They really kind of pulled off the.

1009
00:45:50,435 --> 00:45:53,816
Speaker 1: these are all real people, like what it would really look like if the Internet looked like that.

1010
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:54,258
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

1011
00:45:55,081 --> 00:46:01,600
Speaker 1: And the plot plot of the movie is basically that this kid, you know, was up in the summer camp and someone texts him that summer camp.

1012
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,405
Speaker 1: It's not a summer camp.

1013
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:04,320
Speaker 1: Text him this weird like math puzzle.

1014
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,212
Speaker 0: So he answers it and he's like he was he always.

1015
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,860
Speaker 0: it was a math genius, basically.

1016
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:15,080
Speaker 1: And he kind of accidentally, by answering this question, hacks the whole Internet and then things go crazy.

1017
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,362
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1018
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:22,480
Speaker 0: If you are a technical, you know, I just read this book, Damon, which is written by like a network technology specialist, like a guy who actually knew about computers.

1019
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:31,496
Speaker 0: So it was really great to read a novel that was actually, you know, technologically accurate, as in, you know, it did not offend me by just making up all this computer shit.

1020
00:46:31,537 --> 00:46:32,120
Speaker 0: that wasn't real.

1021
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,359
Speaker 0: It was actually like real computer shit.

1022
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:38,640
Speaker 0: Summer Wars is not that Summer Wars just makes no sense.

1023
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:47,099
Speaker 1: If you know anything about computer, if you're a technological person, it's basically this kid was able to find the two prime like factors of a large number.

1024
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:52,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, no, no, not really.

1025
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:52,700
Speaker 0: Sorry.

1026
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:58,960
Speaker 1: But the movie is just this great kind of parallel where there's this conflict in the, you know, in Oz, in this meta world.

1027
00:46:59,382 --> 00:47:01,200
Speaker 1: But there's also a conflict in the real world.

1028
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,800
Speaker 1: And there's this third conflict, the baseball game.

1029
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:04,643
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1030
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:08,459
Speaker 0: And all the baseball game is just sort of like this metaphor that they keep cutting away to.

1031
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:08,761
Speaker 1: Yep.

1032
00:47:09,084 --> 00:47:11,240
Speaker 1: But all three kind of track parallel.

1033
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:14,820
Speaker 1: And you follow all of them at the same time to this final end conclusion.

1034
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:16,814
Speaker 1: And it it's a romp.

1035
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:17,460
Speaker 1: It's just great.

1036
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,180
Speaker 1: It was it's crazy fun to watch this movie.

1037
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,319
Speaker 0: It's a whole lot of fun.

1038
00:47:21,461 --> 00:47:29,800
Speaker 0: And, you know, it's got something for pretty much, you know, like everybody, like if you're a serious, like if you're looking, you know, it doesn't have too much romance, I guess it only has a tiny bit.

1039
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:32,576
Speaker 1: The thing is, the romance it has is, I think, really good.

1040
00:47:32,697 --> 00:47:33,080
Speaker 0: It's all right.

1041
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,440
Speaker 0: And it's got you know, it's it's got like, you know, some serious parts.

1042
00:47:36,902 --> 00:47:38,540
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of stuff for kids.

1043
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,980
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of, you know, like thoughtful things.

1044
00:47:42,121 --> 00:47:43,720
Speaker 0: It's got a really good animation.

1045
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:53,040
Speaker 1: And the characters are all really, oh, my God, there are a million characters and every one of them is very fleshed out and very iconic.

1046
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:53,384
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1047
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:54,720
Speaker 0: And they're all you know, they're cool.

1048
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,600
Speaker 0: It's like you like them.

1049
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:02,460
Speaker 0: You know, you either like or dislike the ones you're supposed to like or dislike in the correct proportions almost right away.

1050
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:05,100
Speaker 0: You know, they're not like, oh, who cares about these people?

1051
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,140
Speaker 0: It's like you care about pretty much all of them.

1052
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:15,111
Speaker 0: And even the ones that you might not care strongly about, you know, positively or negatively, they at least, you know, have something to them.

1053
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:15,920
Speaker 0: So they stand out.

1054
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,339
Speaker 0: They're not just like faceless, bland, you know, might as well be a stick figure.

1055
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:24,940
Speaker 1: What I like is there's a lot of atmosphere around like the family house where they're staying and how the family is still like.

1056
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:34,380
Speaker 1: they're a modern family, but they're so like proud of their ancient Japanese heritage and they're like the retainers of the family name and they make a big deal about.

1057
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:44,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know, it's surprising that this is, you know, you know, I guess nominally, you know, Japanese like they're acting like a Japanese family would is really similar the way my family is.

1058
00:48:45,463 --> 00:48:47,260
Speaker 0: You know, they're hanging out in the house.

1059
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:51,619
Speaker 0: All the ladies are in the kitchen cooking and all the dudes are watching the sports in the other room.

1060
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,060
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's like it's just like my family is when there's some sort of family get together.

1061
00:48:56,422 --> 00:49:02,899
Speaker 1: Of course, there's the whole weird dichotomy later where, like all the guys and some of the girls are basically planning the war.

1062
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:10,659
Speaker 1: And meanwhile, all the more level headed members of the family are just like, what the fuck is up with those guys while they're like chopping carrots in the kitchen and doing all the normal stuff?

1063
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:23,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's hard to say which character I like the most because King Cosmo just kind of I know it's like King God, even though he basically never wins anything, they make like this.

1064
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,239
Speaker 0: Imagine if, like, you know, they built you're watching Fist of the North Star and they built up Kenshiro and it's like, oh, shit.

1065
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,000
Speaker 1: And they show you Kenshiro killing like everybody.

1066
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:34,980
Speaker 1: And then episode two, Kenshiro just never gets a break.

1067
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,639
Speaker 0: Every has to fight a real bad guy.

1068
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,100
Speaker 0: It doesn't work out, but it doesn't matter because he's still fucking awesome.

1069
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,338
Speaker 0: King Cosmo is way cool.

1070
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the grandma is also way cool.

1071
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,840
Speaker 1: The grandma is basically a gecky guy hero.

1072
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:47,465
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1073
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:48,920
Speaker 1: In every sense of the word.

1074
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:55,730
Speaker 0: And I also I really like, you know, all like, you know, the like the firefighter and the policeman,

1075
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,359
Speaker 1: the fishing uncle with the squid,

1076
00:49:57,379 --> 00:50:06,625
Speaker 0: the fishing uncle with the squid is basically this is this array of uncles and the uncles are all like firemen, EMTs, policemen, all this sort of stuff.

1077
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:08,180
Speaker 0: And they're all really awesome.

1078
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:08,846
Speaker 1: Well, that's the thing.

1079
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:09,779
Speaker 1: The family's so big.

1080
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,198
Speaker 1: Everyone in the family has some crazy thing like their thing is the SDF secret guy.

1081
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even even the bad family trader is kind of wobbly scared.

1082
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,090
Speaker 0: I'll be scared.

1083
00:50:20,372 --> 00:50:21,120
Speaker 1: I like his character.

1084
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,363
Speaker 1: And he kind of reminds me of the guy because he looks like, you know, an evil guy.

1085
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:35,736
Speaker 0: You know, the visual designs of the characters are do a really good job of looking like real people and also matching the personality of the character and the avatars of the character.

1086
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:40,660
Speaker 0: characters in the world of Oz match the personality and look of the real person.

1087
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

1088
00:50:41,243 --> 00:50:44,244
Speaker 1: Like every character is so iconic of their personality.

1089
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:46,019
Speaker 1: But then their avatar is the same thing.

1090
00:50:46,261 --> 00:50:51,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the sports girl who basically doesn't care about any of this and just trying to watch the baseball game.

1091
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,480
Speaker 0: One thing that really gets me about this movie that I'm still trying to figure out is how they got away with so much trademark infringement.

1092
00:50:57,742 --> 00:50:59,199
Speaker 0: Usually when you watch like a U.S.

1093
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:05,920
Speaker 0: movie, right, and they're drinking soda, it won't be Coke or Pepsi unless Coke or Pepsi paid for product placement.

1094
00:51:06,061 --> 00:51:11,000
Speaker 0: It'll always be like, you know, Cola X or something, you know, those make something up to use in the movie.

1095
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,240
Speaker 0: They won't show any product logos or anything.

1096
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:19,536
Speaker 0: In Summer Wars, they show the girls where it is wearing a Red Sox jersey, drinking Dr.

1097
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,517
Speaker 0: Pepper one, the drinking Dr.

1098
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:31,160
Speaker 0: Pepper, real iPhone, the real iPhones and other to other cell phones from Japan, real brand names on, you know, the televisions and all these sorts of other devices.

1099
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:31,522
Speaker 0: Right.

1100
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,240
Speaker 0: I guess there's the Dell computers.

1101
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,429
Speaker 0: He has a Dell laptop.

1102
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,299
Speaker 0: It says Dell on it.

1103
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,180
Speaker 0: CNN is on the television.

1104
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,100
Speaker 0: It says CNN, not like GNN or anything.

1105
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,107
Speaker 1: I like this.

1106
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:41,860
Speaker 1: I like this a lot.

1107
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,979
Speaker 1: I wish more movies did this.

1108
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,079
Speaker 0: If it was just real, I also wish because then it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb and take you out of the movie.

1109
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:56,284
Speaker 0: But in because other movies take you out of the movie with it, I was taken out of this movie with it because I was like, how did they get away with it?

1110
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:58,299
Speaker 0: Why didn't they get sued to all fuck?

1111
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,519
Speaker 1: I thought that at first.

1112
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:01,107
Speaker 1: But then there's no way.

1113
00:52:01,469 --> 00:52:05,399
Speaker 0: Apple and Apple and they had Windows, the computers had Windows seven on the desktop.

1114
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,700
Speaker 0: Literally, King Cosmo logo and everything.

1115
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,960
Speaker 1: King Cosmo just made me forget.

1116
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, King Cosmo is the fucking shit.

1117
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,260
Speaker 1: Also, the whole thing at the end with the Hanafuda.

1118
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, Hanafuda is.

1119
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,860
Speaker 0: I still don't know how to play Hanafuda.

1120
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,540
Speaker 0: And I tried to learn at Zenkai Con because I read the rules, kind of.

1121
00:52:22,063 --> 00:52:24,040
Speaker 0: It looks like a stupid game, to be perfectly honest.

1122
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,820
Speaker 0: Probably, but but it plays a major role in this movie.

1123
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:30,200
Speaker 1: It is used to proper effect in this movie.

1124
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,420
Speaker 0: It really didn't matter what game it was, you know?

1125
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I like that it was Hanafuda because it's like an old Japanese traditional game.

1126
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:38,300
Speaker 1: that was the traditional game of the family.

1127
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:39,497
Speaker 1: And then it matters in the end.

1128
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:47,700
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, that also reminded me a lot of my family, you know, as we have all these games that, you know, we would play like my family likes to play Michigan Rummy, which is also a crap game.

1129
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:48,305
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

1130
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:50,320
Speaker 0: Michigan Rummy is also terrible.

1131
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,177
Speaker 1: Scott, I'm from Michigan.

1132
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:51,924
Speaker 0: I know.

1133
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:52,267
Speaker 0: Right.

1134
00:52:52,307 --> 00:52:53,960
Speaker 0: So, you know, I'm sorry.

1135
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:55,164
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

1136
00:52:55,728 --> 00:52:59,720
Speaker 0: So, you know, there are other games you play, though, like Rummy Q. Rummy Q is pretty big in my family.

1137
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,778
Speaker 0: It's also a terrible game.

1138
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:06,980
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, that the game has a special traditional, you know, sentimental value in the family.

1139
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:15,664
Speaker 0: So the fact that their family had Hanafuda as their sentimental game, it was like I could really identify with the family in this movie pretty strongly.

1140
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:20,780
Speaker 0: And I think that actually because of that, I think that my actual family will probably like this movie a whole lot.

1141
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,760
Speaker 0: I think when it comes out on DVD, they'll probably enjoy it.

1142
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,058
Speaker 1: This is another one of those anime movies where I cannot picture the kind of person who would not like it.

1143
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:49,080
Speaker 0: Like if you want to get a, you know, a moderately close idea to what my family would be like at, you know, like a birthday party or, you know, Thanksgiving or something, you watch this movie and, you know, minus the world changing computer events in the world of Oz, it's pretty close, you know, as close as any movie is going to get, I think ever.

1144
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:52,644
Speaker 1: You know, I got to say, though, I really like Natsuki, the main character, too.

1145
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:55,100
Speaker 0: He's he's pretty good because, you know, that's Kenji.

1146
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,411
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the girl.

1147
00:53:56,876 --> 00:53:57,300
Speaker 0: Oh, the girl.

1148
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:58,640
Speaker 0: You think the girl's the main character?

1149
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,820
Speaker 1: Well, the girl and the guy are both very nice.

1150
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,480
Speaker 0: The main character, the girls, the girl is like, you know, the supporting number two character.

1151
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,780
Speaker 1: Look at all the cover art for everything.

1152
00:54:07,921 --> 00:54:17,259
Speaker 1: And the girl is the front because remember, she's the one who kind of like picks up the flame of the family and becomes like she's going to be exactly like the grandma was.

1153
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,960
Speaker 0: That is true, is that she is perhaps the central character in the plot.

1154
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,080
Speaker 0: She's the linchpin, but the it is told from the perspective of the dude.

1155
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,583
Speaker 1: But that's it.

1156
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,600
Speaker 0: He's and he has more screen time.

1157
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:34,063
Speaker 0: And I guess he has a larger role in the, you know, the how the events turn out.

1158
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:41,900
Speaker 1: See, I feel like the story is not about him because he doesn't really grow or change much as a character.

1159
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,840
Speaker 0: It's just, you know, but what it is is like you're coming into this family.

1160
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:45,103
Speaker 0: Right.

1161
00:54:45,124 --> 00:54:46,280
Speaker 0: But you're not in the family.

1162
00:54:46,581 --> 00:54:54,883
Speaker 0: So he serves as, you know, the outsider to the family that you can latch onto and also be the outsider to the family and learn about the family of care, you know?

1163
00:54:54,903 --> 00:55:02,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, they really the film really catches the idea, like the way you feel if you're staying with someone's crazy family and you don't really know any of them.

1164
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:08,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if I just made a movie of my family, but it was from my perspective, right, you wouldn't really learn anything because I know all these people.

1165
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:15,120
Speaker 0: But if you made the film from Rims perspective coming over to Thanksgiving, it'd be like, oh, I'm learning who grandma is.

1166
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:17,340
Speaker 0: I'm learning who, you know, Aunt Cheryl is.

1167
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,939
Speaker 1: I think she's the main character because you look at her and look at what happens, even while Biscay isn't really the main character.

1168
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,902
Speaker 0: Now, what Biscay is, is not even close to the main character, but he's important.

1169
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:27,140
Speaker 0: But he's basically just like a conflict item.

1170
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:41,479
Speaker 1: What I would say is that look at what the history of the family, not spoiling anything and what had happened, you know, what 10 years ago and all that business and look at like the whole history of the of Sakai, the grandma, and how she ended up and who she was at the end.

1171
00:55:42,062 --> 00:55:45,840
Speaker 1: And you see that the exact same process is happening for Natsuki.

1172
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:57,280
Speaker 1: Of course, like these events are what are making her exactly like her grandma, a bad ass with a grandma, a bad ass, the grandma pulls out that friggin telephone nogginada.

1173
00:55:57,883 --> 00:56:00,740
Speaker 1: Oh, that's it tries to kill and not to spoil anything.

1174
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:04,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the telephone scene was even more bad as you know.

1175
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,180
Speaker 0: Another thing is that the emotions of the people are very realistic.

1176
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,880
Speaker 0: It's not melodramatic, like, say, you know, Leiji Matsumoto movies are.

1177
00:56:13,602 --> 00:56:16,820
Speaker 0: Everyone had very realistic real world emotion.

1178
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:25,660
Speaker 0: They cry when it's appropriate to cry at the appropriate amount and type of crying, you know, the appropriate, you know, amount and type of anger.

1179
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,020
Speaker 0: You know, everything was you know, it was slightly exaggerated because it is an animated, you know, movie.

1180
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,104
Speaker 0: But, you know, it wasn't.

1181
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,823
Speaker 0: it was very, you know, realistic, I think, in that sense.

1182
00:56:35,923 --> 00:56:38,039
Speaker 0: And thus, you know, it felt good to watch.

1183
00:56:38,422 --> 00:56:40,220
Speaker 1: Plus, the animation is just beautiful.

1184
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:48,220
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's a it's a madhouse movie, but I mean, with full, you know, Japanese anime movie monies from a high quality studio.

1185
00:56:48,381 --> 00:56:53,122
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's pretty much like, you know, Satoshi Kon movie level of animation.

1186
00:56:53,303 --> 00:57:00,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but especially they almost all the fights and things in the super flat world are just really, really well done.

1187
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:08,683
Speaker 0: So and the other thing is that they used a lot of, you know, I mean, obviously they use computers to animate most of the movie as any anime these days.

1188
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:12,160
Speaker 0: But the world of Oz is like computer generated.

1189
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:17,359
Speaker 0: But it's supposed to be because it's, you know, the computer computer world and outside the world of Oz.

1190
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:21,080
Speaker 0: You know, you can't really if there is computer animation, you can't tell.

1191
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:24,460
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's all, you know, 2D animated style.

1192
00:57:24,601 --> 00:57:26,499
Speaker 0: So it works really awesomely.

1193
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:27,302
Speaker 1: Yep.

1194
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:31,000
Speaker 1: Plus, the movie kind of just escalates and escalates and escalates.

1195
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,660
Speaker 1: They're like four square bosses.

1196
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,580
Speaker 0: That is the one flaw I saw in it.

1197
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,780
Speaker 0: And that's it's sort of kept square bossing too much.

1198
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,999
Speaker 0: I felt like they should have.

1199
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,979
Speaker 1: They needed one less square boss.

1200
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1201
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:43,080
Speaker 0: They needed one or two less square bosses.

1202
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:48,580
Speaker 0: And then it would have been, you know, but and just, you know, sort of extend the conflict.

1203
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,457
Speaker 1: But at the same time, look at how it worked out with the first square boss, the castle thing they do.

1204
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:53,720
Speaker 1: Right.

1205
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1206
00:57:54,244 --> 00:57:55,820
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, that will take care of this.

1207
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:57,959
Speaker 1: And then it all you know what happens after that.

1208
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:04,820
Speaker 1: And it's like this frantic action in the virtual world, frantic action, frantic action of all the people doing the thing in the virtual world, in the real world.

1209
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:13,200
Speaker 1: And then the thing that broke it all, it cuts back to the guy in the real world is really slowly kind of like, I don't want to be doing this there.

1210
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,102
Speaker 1: Job done.

1211
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:17,376
Speaker 1: That got that jerk.

1212
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:18,120
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1213
00:58:21,904 --> 00:58:23,639
Speaker 0: Anyway, is there anything else to say about this movie?

1214
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,488
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1215
00:58:24,508 --> 00:58:25,119
Speaker 1: This movie is great.

1216
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:26,800
Speaker 0: The music was, you know, pretty good.

1217
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,832
Speaker 0: It's not like I get the soundtrack or anything because I can't even remember any song from it.

1218
00:58:31,055 --> 00:58:31,440
Speaker 1: But yeah.

1219
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:36,759
Speaker 1: But you didn't remember any songs from Giant Robo, which has one of the best anime soundtracks in the history of anime.

1220
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,946
Speaker 0: But I do remember that while I was watching it, that there was some music that I enjoyed.

1221
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:42,440
Speaker 0: I just don't remember what that music was.

1222
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,847
Speaker 0: So, you know, I'll give it.

1223
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:46,060
Speaker 0: I'll give it a B plus on the musics and such.

1224
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:52,519
Speaker 1: I will admit, I really not to keys avatar because everyone has their avatar is crazily cute.

1225
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:54,700
Speaker 0: I like the guy who's the dumpling.

1226
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,024
Speaker 1: I like that one, too.

1227
00:58:56,044 --> 00:58:58,560
Speaker 1: But I think hers and King Cosmo are the best ones.

1228
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1229
00:58:59,021 --> 00:59:02,379
Speaker 0: Well, King Cosmo is, you know, King Cosmo is that character where he's.

1230
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,080
Speaker 0: he's not ultimately, you know, deep or super important.

1231
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:07,719
Speaker 0: He's just like wicked cool.

1232
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:11,280
Speaker 0: He's there for the kids, but he's just so awesome.

1233
00:59:11,362 --> 00:59:15,500
Speaker 0: It's just like, all right, let's just make some character that is just fucking so awesome.

1234
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,540
Speaker 1: Halsey was kind of like that, too, with all the kids, like he answered something about what character you like the most.

1235
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:25,573
Speaker 1: And the kid was kind of like, oh, and he was like, I should have just said King Cosmo because they're like, you know, director of this movie.

1236
00:59:25,613 --> 00:59:26,580
Speaker 0: What was your favorite character?

1237
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,279
Speaker 0: I think the grandma is my favorite character.

1238
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:31,177
Speaker 0: Well, maybe I should have said King Cosmo.

1239
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:38,040
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's King Cosmo is just so fucking awesome.

1240
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,620
Speaker 1: I got to admit, I also really like Love Machine's character design.

1241
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,040
Speaker 0: He looks like he has a great character design is don't really.

1242
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,600
Speaker 0: I didn't really like the character, except when he was griefing everybody.

1243
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,572
Speaker 1: He was kind of doing it the way that, like, 4chan kids were actually like the love machine.

1244
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:52,980
Speaker 0: better before he transformed.

1245
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,960
Speaker 0: Well, you know, while he was still like, you know, before he transformed while he was still stealing Kenji's character.

1246
00:59:58,403 --> 00:59:59,876
Speaker 0: It was I think it was that was really fun.

1247
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:00,279
Speaker 0: That part.

1248
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:02,259
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, well, there's the three levels of him.

1249
01:00:02,441 --> 01:00:05,000
Speaker 1: I mean, there's the, you know, demon at the end, big black thing.

1250
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:06,266
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

1251
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,852
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1252
01:00:06,912 --> 01:00:07,699
Speaker 0: Square boss style.

1253
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,640
Speaker 1: He was creepy when he was just stealing and kind of comedic.

1254
01:00:11,002 --> 01:00:13,798
Speaker 1: But then he basically turned into the bad guy from a fighting game.

1255
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:14,160
Speaker 0: Yep.

1256
01:00:17,685 --> 01:00:19,060
Speaker 0: I don't think it was the summer wars.

1257
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,459
Speaker 0: It'll be on DVD eventually.

1258
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,536
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, Girl Who Left Through Time is on DVD in the U.S Summer Wars will almost definitely be on DVD in the U.S.

1259
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:26,040
Speaker 0: eventually.

1260
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:28,060
Speaker 1: There's no reason for me to spoil anything.

1261
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:36,240
Speaker 1: The final thoughts I would have to say about this movie are five minutes worth at most, and frankly, just there is no one who will not like this movie.

1262
01:00:36,602 --> 01:00:38,700
Speaker 1: If you find them, let us know, because there's something wrong with them.

1263
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,560
Speaker 1: This movie is just great.

1264
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

1265
01:00:40,464 --> 01:00:42,580
Speaker 0: I'm not going to tell you that it's the best movie ever.

1266
01:00:43,063 --> 01:00:43,707
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

1267
01:00:43,747 --> 01:00:45,940
Speaker 0: Citizen Kane, Akira, Paprika.

1268
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:46,603
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1269
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:47,360
Speaker 0: Ghibli level.

1270
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,162
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1271
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:50,780
Speaker 0: I think it's about the same as Topeka in terms of qualities.

1272
01:00:51,462 --> 01:00:52,930
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's that kind of.

1273
01:00:52,991 --> 01:01:02,220
Speaker 1: it's like a Tokyo Godfather's quality, like exactly the same awesomeness, same feeling, same like romp ride through just this this fantasy, awesome adventure start to finish.

1274
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:08,880
Speaker 0: Like, you know, so, you know, if if I was giving, you know, numeric scores, it would give it the exact same numeric score of awesomeness.

1275
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:12,860
Speaker 0: And it would be a high score, like at least nine out of ten as Tokyo Godfather's got.

1276
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,640
Speaker 0: So Summer Wars is good.

1277
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,900
Speaker 0: Go watch it by whatever means necessary.

1278
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:24,780
Speaker 1: And of course, if you like it, I'd recommend checking out The Girl Who Left Through Time, which is very, very similar.

1279
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still haven't watched it.

1280
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:26,874
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

1281
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:27,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll get it.

1282
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,428
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh.

1283
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:29,095
Speaker 1: I have to see it.
