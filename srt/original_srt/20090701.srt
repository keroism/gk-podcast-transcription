1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:09,560
Speaker 1: 

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,549
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Wednesday July 1st.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:12,332
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,259
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

5
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:19,779
Speaker 0: tonight We talk about how to make anime cons better aka what I learned about Otacon from PAX.

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:39,602
Speaker 0: So today right I come out of work And I'm walking across the street to Grand Central and I see two women and they're standing like kind of in front of the sliding Doors.

8
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:53,059
Speaker 0: I had to kind of go around them to get out and as I walk past them I hear the one woman who looks very very frustrated and angry say to the other one just try the fucking things on and I look and she's holding a pair of sunglasses

9
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,599
Speaker 1: My god.

10
00:00:56,182 --> 00:01:01,663
Speaker 0: So I stopped and I watched them and the other ones like I don't wanna and then they both look at me Like what.

11
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:02,848
Speaker 0: so I just walked away.

12
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:09,068
Speaker 0: Oh, you should have been like I Had a day in like 30 seconds.

13
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,334
Speaker 1: Oh, do you know there's gonna be like it's it?

14
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:16,686
Speaker 1: Roddy Piper is gonna show up right then You know, he was on his way.

15
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:17,851
Speaker 0: I know he was.

16
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:19,577
Speaker 1: how could you not wait to see him?

17
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,883
Speaker 1: man High five.

18
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:29,437
Speaker 0: I mean I actually had seen the South Park episode first and I'm people kept saying yeah That's the same fight is from they live and I was like what they live.

19
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:29,839
Speaker 0: What's that?

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,355
Speaker 1: And then we watch they live and then I was like, oh they live is that thing.

21
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:35,178
Speaker 1: Oh, bang.

22
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:35,579
Speaker 1: Oh, bang.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,297
Speaker 0: But that amused me for like 10 minutes after I got on the train.

24
00:01:42,504 --> 00:01:43,813
Speaker 1: I don't want to put the sunglasses.

25
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:49,559
Speaker 0: Oh My god, there's no way like they did not look like they were having fun.

26
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,820
Speaker 0: So there is no way that they were joking.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,290
Speaker 0: Maybe one of them was knew the other one was pissed off anyway And was messing with them because they knew they didn't know.

28
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,094
Speaker 0: but I don't know.

29
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:00,320
Speaker 0: I'll never know.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,088
Speaker 0: It's you know, maybe well we can.

31
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:05,225
Speaker 1: maybe we should start a thing where people go out You know, they do the.

32
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:06,273
Speaker 0: it's a good idea.

33
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:12,580
Speaker 1: improv everywhere You know, they do think they'll go and do like a flash mob here like a statue one But it's always like a big flash mob.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,428
Speaker 0: You gotta get more like something where it's like retail.

35
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:19,880
Speaker 1: two people will just appear in a place and reenact as a movie scene.

36
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,286
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing to do.

37
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:27,220
Speaker 0: remember even mega 64 used to do that with a with the video games But they'd have like one or two people instead of a flash mob.

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,226
Speaker 0: But it was still kind of.

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,340
Speaker 0: it was very obvious what they were doing.

40
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:38,253
Speaker 0: You got to do it so subtle that half the time no one around you will even notice But it's all worth it for that one person who goes home and goes.

41
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:39,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could do it.

42
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,260
Speaker 1: now I'm thinking more, you know, just pick a scene from a movie.

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:58,338
Speaker 1: It could be a small one like that right where suddenly two people so they break out into a fight in an alley somewhere right or You could even do a big one right like, you know Get a whole bunch of kung fu people right and go to a crowd

44
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:58,619
Speaker 0: Scott.

45
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:01,819
Speaker 0: Here's the reason why we should not do the fight ones.

46
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:14,949
Speaker 0: Remember at RIT when we had all those shinai and bokto and we were all fighting with each other outside of Gracie's at like 2 In the morning and campus safety comes around the corner Not guns blazing but flashlight blazing.

47
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,494
Speaker 0: What the hell's going on?

48
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:17,918
Speaker 0: Oh my god, then we all stop.

49
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:18,400
Speaker 0: We're like what?

50
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, just a fight.

51
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:27,060
Speaker 1: No biggie No, but you had like, you know a movie kung fu fight just suddenly bust out somewhere and it was all awesome.

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:36,805
Speaker 0: The key Key to anything like that is the subtlety to where someone is not quite sure if it was a joke if it was intentional It's one of the.

53
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:41,631
Speaker 0: you got to leave them thinking and wondering about it something that will bother them for the rest of their lives.

54
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:49,240
Speaker 1: you can have a guy or you can you know get someone to dress Up as like Arnold right and then get a kid and they'll drive a motorcycle down the street and get a guy dressed up.

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,272
Speaker 1: Is you know t1000 running like behind them?

56
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:54,180
Speaker 1: No, just drive down the street like that.

57
00:03:54,521 --> 00:04:00,877
Speaker 0: Better just get a guy who looks just like the t1000 and have him just run like all around New York City like that.

58
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:03,825
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it's not.

59
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:04,889
Speaker 1: people might not get it.

60
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,616
Speaker 0: So you see that's the point.

61
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:07,620
Speaker 0: That's the best prank.

62
00:04:10,562 --> 00:04:14,796
Speaker 0: The people see it now, no, no my case in point is it's a good night for flying.

63
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,887
Speaker 0: That's no good That's that's the best.

64
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,380
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's anime day.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,200
Speaker 0: We got to talk about anime.

66
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:27,746
Speaker 0: With any talk of anime in July must come talk of Otakon because we used to do, you know this time last year We would do a show every night.

67
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:29,814
Speaker 0: So every week we had an anime show.

68
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:30,878
Speaker 0: we run out of stuff to say.

69
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:35,636
Speaker 0: Otakon's done more stuff every two weeks than we can keep up with.

70
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,700
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I'd never.

71
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:38,507
Speaker 1: It's a sort of obvious.

72
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,975
Speaker 1: I never really realized it before.

73
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:44,995
Speaker 1: but like The conventions have to announce all their shit before pre-reg ends.

74
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:46,280
Speaker 1: Otherwise, what's the point right?

75
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:49,040
Speaker 1: I Never really thought about that.

76
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:50,485
Speaker 0: But they do.

77
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:53,136
Speaker 0: I mean pre-reg for Otakon ends at midnight tonight.

78
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:57,688
Speaker 0: Oh shit, and They announced the last couple of crazy things.

79
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,411
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

80
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:05,353
Speaker 0: Just in case you weren't already planning to go Otakon This might be in terms of just star power the best Otakon ever.

81
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,260
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it has the musical star power.

82
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,290
Speaker 0: Well, no, that's all right aside from you.

83
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:09,832
Speaker 0: I mean, they don't have.

84
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:10,556
Speaker 0: yoko kano.

85
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,349
Speaker 0: larku Vamps is playing a concert but not at Otakon.

86
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:15,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't count.

87
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,776
Speaker 0: That's a before Otakon.

88
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,040
Speaker 0: Yeah close enough.

89
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:18,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't count.

90
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:23,220
Speaker 0: but they got some big-name people come in here big-name anime people.

91
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, Fred showed I want to go bother him.

92
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:34,104
Speaker 0: No We gotta bother him so much because we did not appreciate the resource we had at RIT and we did not appreciate how cool He was back then.

93
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:41,394
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't see him at RIT, but he was at RIT before we were at Previous like the anime club years before.

94
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,739
Speaker 1: us got him to come to RIT.

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

96
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:56,363
Speaker 0: and we were like, oh some guy came to RIT because we'd always library that all the VHS is a fan subs and in there was like this ten tapes of like Fred shot lectures from RIT and We just ignored it.

97
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:57,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, no idea what it was.

98
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,994
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one no one appreciated.

99
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:01,318
Speaker 1: and now it's too late.

100
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:02,000
Speaker 1: We know better.

101
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:07,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've got Yukata Yamamoto, you know, oh you didn't watch RIT yet did you?

102
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:08,600
Speaker 1: I watched like two episodes.

103
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,071
Speaker 0: It's one of the better shows that came out.

104
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,923
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Okay.

105
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:13,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all you gotta say.

106
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,819
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot more guests, but if you don't care I can just move on.

107
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,334
Speaker 1: Why do you just you asked me if I knew someone?

108
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:20,400
Speaker 1: I told you I didn't know who they were.

109
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,288
Speaker 0: All right, but they got Ishiguro.

110
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,100
Speaker 0: So I'm sure Scott Johnson is going to be all about this.

111
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,858
Speaker 1: That's an important person very important direct at all.

112
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:30,305
Speaker 0: the greats Like Habsburgs dying.

113
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:36,727
Speaker 0: yeah Habsburgs dying to the revenge, you know, you know Macross He's been at conventions before.

114
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:40,301
Speaker 1: you know, it's not like he's never been to an anime convention the u.s Before.

115
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:44,639
Speaker 1: he's been to quite a few is just his first Otakon appearance, which is pretty big.

116
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:48,154
Speaker 1: I think it's also the first time I've been at the same con that he's been at.

117
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:51,449
Speaker 0: if I'm not mistaken The thing is only in the last few years.

118
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,620
Speaker 0: I've paid a lot more attention to the guests.

119
00:06:54,183 --> 00:06:56,980
Speaker 0: I used to just not pay attention so much because we didn't know who they were.

120
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:00,460
Speaker 0: Well also because you know, I was busy doing a lot more stuff at conventions.

121
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,834
Speaker 0: I mean remember last year we had that artist alley thing in like six panels.

122
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,320
Speaker 0: We're not doing that anymore.

123
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,992
Speaker 1: I remember when I went to the anime next and Rintaro was there.

124
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:08,936
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

125
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:09,760
Speaker 1: We just sort of walk.

126
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,085
Speaker 1: We didn't plan on seeing him.

127
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,510
Speaker 1: We're like, oh nothing else going on.

128
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,774
Speaker 1: And I was like, no one.

129
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:14,798
Speaker 0: that was real.

130
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:21,040
Speaker 0: sad though It was I don't know what was sadder the fact that there was almost no one there or the fact that the few people who?

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,176
Speaker 0: Were there could not think of a single interesting question to ask him.

132
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,340
Speaker 1: Yeah Not us either.

133
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:31,596
Speaker 0: Not those days, but I mean they've got anyway, and she was the voice of bel dandy.

134
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:32,238
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,829
Speaker 0: Yeah But uh, I guess we're petering out here.

136
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:37,154
Speaker 0: I guess no banter.

137
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:37,595
Speaker 0: Nothing.

138
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:38,680
Speaker 0: Nothing to say about Otakon.

139
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, what do I have to say?

140
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,355
Speaker 1: This is awesome people's go and it's Otakon.

141
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,400
Speaker 1: It's gonna be alright.

142
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,125
Speaker 0: Well, this you'll be excited about.

143
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:45,948
Speaker 0: remember last year.

144
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:52,472
Speaker 0: They had the Otakon animation the opening animation done by madhouse Yep, and it was crazy awesome.

145
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:56,087
Speaker 0: and they had trouble, you know contractually They couldn't show it a bunch of times.

146
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,315
Speaker 0: They couldn't like release it out on the internet.

147
00:07:58,335 --> 00:07:59,679
Speaker 1: They only showed it two times.

148
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:08,620
Speaker 0: Well for this year Once a day Otakon 2009, they showed it officially three times, but I believe it was accidentally shown four times.

149
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:09,498
Speaker 0: But they will deny that.

150
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:16,650
Speaker 0: Anyway for Otakon 2009, there's going to be a new Opener to Otakon done again by madhouse.

151
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:17,453
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

152
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,460
Speaker 1: Well, isn't a mariama coming again?

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,248
Speaker 1: Yes, he goes to Otakon all the time.

154
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,339
Speaker 1: They madhouse fucking loves Otakon.

155
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,180
Speaker 0: Well, I think a lot of that has to do with the Jim Bowles being the freaking deity of Japanese.

156
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,428
Speaker 1: I think madhouse just loves Otakon.

157
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,735
Speaker 0: Otakon is the best anime convention in the u.s.

158
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:33,659
Speaker 0: Hands down.

159
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,626
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean what anime Expo?

160
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, which you've never been to.

161
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:38,476
Speaker 1: so we have no idea.

162
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:41,897
Speaker 1: Katsu khan We'll get to that.

163
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:43,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get to that.

164
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:48,660
Speaker 0: but quote the inspiration is once again the much-loved daikon for openings.

165
00:08:48,820 --> 00:09:03,619
Speaker 1: Of course, I mean, you know back in the day right there were opening animations to conventions, you know That's sort of you know, daikon 3 daikon 4, you know And many others that are not so good and thus were not remembered or kept.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,280
Speaker 1: But you know, so it's like that's sort of something that went away and Otakon has decided to bring it back And I think it's a very good thing.

167
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:25,520
Speaker 1: They brought it back and I think other Conventions that are perhaps not big enough to get madhouse to make them animated openers Should go out of their way to make their own and you know There are plenty of conventions that have the resources to do their own.

168
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:31,279
Speaker 1: I'm looking at you New York anime festival, New York comic-con PAX East-West And do something.

169
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,518
Speaker 0: Well, PAX has the keynote at least, you know,

170
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:48,332
Speaker 1: PAX They should make a game that is the PAX game and it could just be like a little, you know Fakak the tiny game but they should make like, you know, the PAX o7 game and it could be like, you know Just something you download or something, you know tiny like that, you

171
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,959
Speaker 0: know, some terrible game.

172
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,100
Speaker 1: No, I just feel like a little cute PAX game.

173
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:00,608
Speaker 1: It could be like just a really small clever thing, you know and just put it out there hand out CDs or you know Let people walk up and down or something.

174
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:00,969
Speaker 1: I don't know.

175
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,371
Speaker 1: Yep.

176
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,440
Speaker 0: But one thing I can say about Otakon too.

177
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:08,359
Speaker 0: They put up a nice announcement about pre-reg that I will summarize here.

178
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,468
Speaker 0: Don't line up early on Thursday.

179
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,275
Speaker 0: There's no point.

180
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:14,580
Speaker 0: you will get your badge.

181
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,989
Speaker 0: There is nothing else to do.

182
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,820
Speaker 0: after you get your badge go home.

183
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,806
Speaker 1: It's first of all, right.

184
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,680
Speaker 1: Oh a people aren't gonna go home after they get their badge because they want to hang out.

185
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:25,285
Speaker 1: That's right.

186
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:26,999
Speaker 1: That's why they're there Thursday, right?

187
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:30,300
Speaker 0: Don't hang out right outside the exit.

188
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,779
Speaker 1: Well, that's true.

189
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:40,028
Speaker 1: I have talked to people at the front of lines at Thursday Otakons who have waited there all day and I asked them Why did you wait here all day?

190
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,153
Speaker 1: One guy has ever had a good answer And all they say is that they're there for the experience.

191
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:46,780
Speaker 1: they like to be in the line.

192
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,182
Speaker 1: They don't.

193
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,226
Speaker 1: they want to wait.

194
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,311
Speaker 0: see that we're all.

195
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:53,246
Speaker 1: is no one waiting in that line Doesn't want to?

196
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,918
Speaker 0: here's where I disagree slightly at the front of the line.

197
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,420
Speaker 0: That is true.

198
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:04,552
Speaker 0: I mean the people at the front of that line are definitely there for that sort of thing, but go about a Thousand two thousand three thousand people further out in the line.

199
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:08,191
Speaker 0: There are hot pissed off Dehydrated fanboys.

200
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:09,259
Speaker 0: just they want their badge.

201
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:12,208
Speaker 1: Well, if you just you know the badge.

202
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:15,297
Speaker 1: the early badge line opens at what time?

203
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,907
Speaker 0: five five p.m And we'll end at eleven.

204
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,030
Speaker 1: it ends at eleven.

205
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:29,497
Speaker 1: if you show up at that line at seven or eight You're just gonna walk right in get your badge and walk right out Unless you're a panelist or a member of the press, right?

206
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,949
Speaker 1: But you know, so there's no reason.

207
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,840
Speaker 1: unless you like waiting in line.

208
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,524
Speaker 1: Don't get in that line before Seven or eight o'clock.

209
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:41,438
Speaker 1: if you just want your badge Thursday just show up in Baltimore sometime.

210
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:41,900
Speaker 1: Thursday.

211

Speaker 1: It's before 7 or 8 p.m.

212
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:54,360
Speaker 1: And around 7 or 8 p.m You know, I mean you can even go there at 10 p.m If you you know If you have such a good time and you'll definitely just walk right in get your badge and walk right out with no problem.

213
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:54,962
Speaker 1: No, waiting.

214
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:58,092
Speaker 1: No nothing and it'll be a totally awesome experience.

215
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:02,008
Speaker 1: if you hate waiting in line, so don't wait in line Don't want to.

216
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:07,020
Speaker 1: if you do like waiting in line Show up early because there will be people there to wait in line with you.

217
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,200
Speaker 1: And why would you miss out in a minute of waiting in line that you love and of course?

218
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,065
Speaker 0: We've said this before but we will be at Otacon with much of the front row crew But not the entire front row crew.

219
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:21,560
Speaker 0: many people have bailed some for lame reasons some for amazing reasons.

220
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:35,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are people who are not front row crew who will be there many podcasters and other internet peoples You like who cares about them and any other people who listen to this podcast including you and others.

221
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,513
Speaker 0: We are only doing three panels, but there are three high-quality panel.

222
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:40,120
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, isn't it pre schedule out?

223
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,723
Speaker 1: I didn't look at it.

224
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:41,649
Speaker 0: I didn't look at it either.

225
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:42,192
Speaker 1: I forgot.

226
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:43,440
Speaker 1: I have to look at that.

227
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,420
Speaker 0: But anyway, we're doing beyond D&D anime.

228
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:52,488
Speaker 0: You should see and know your creators and I'll just say one last time to make sure those are other is do not Go to our anime.

229
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,240
Speaker 0: You should see if you have already been to it.

230
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,000
Speaker 0: We have not added anime to the anime.

231
00:12:56,983 --> 00:13:00,060
Speaker 0: That is not the panel for you if you're someone who has seen anime.

232
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:02,875
Speaker 0: This is for people who don't know what cowboy bebop is.

233
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:07,053
Speaker 0: Yep Which is about a half of Otacon as far as I can tell.

234
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:09,823
Speaker 1: Well, it was half of Anyway, Boston.

235
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:11,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

236
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,538
Speaker 0: we did a panel like that at Otacon before and people hadn't seen anything.

237
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,752
Speaker 1: Hmm It's very sad some of these situations.

238
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,340
Speaker 0: I still don't know what to do about it.

239
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:24,132
Speaker 1: It's so weird like the kind of mixes you'll get like a kinetic on.

240
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,660
Speaker 1: there was someone who actually knew what the Itano circus was.

241
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,804
Speaker 0: Yeah one person.

242
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:31,116
Speaker 1: but it like you'll get it and that was a tiny room with only a few people.

243
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:34,008
Speaker 1: but like another convention You get this giant room full of people.

244
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,073
Speaker 1: zero people know what it is.

245
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,138
Speaker 1: It's like what happened here.

246
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:39,745
Speaker 0: But we will announce.

247
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:43,479
Speaker 0: since we only have our three panels and we did we chose not to get an artist alley table.

248
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:50,200
Speaker 0: this year We will have some sort of crew get-together probably on Saturday, but I can't promise that yet.

249
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,539
Speaker 0: Twitter and the forum and our website will tell you where that is.

250
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know such we can.

251
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,520
Speaker 1: we got a nice get-together maybe out on our nice the patio at the tables.

252
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:02,800
Speaker 0: But depending on the weather's I do want to mention this briefly.

253
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:13,160
Speaker 0: This is this is not it's kind of breaking news out there But we are consolidating all of the full information before we report on this in any capacity, but no, let's just report on it.

254
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,963
Speaker 1: Well, we got enough.

255
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:15,028
Speaker 1: We got some information.

256
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:24,505
Speaker 0: We have a lot but I guess I will qualify everything We're about to say by saying that this is primarily information gleaned from voyeurism Second-hand sources and hearsay.

257
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,067
Speaker 0: Hmm.

258
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:30,220
Speaker 0: However, it is second-hand sources that I trust and hearsay that has been reliable in the past.

259
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,068
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on with katsu khan next year.

260
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:36,578
Speaker 1: Yeah katsu khan, you know, they moved to a new hotel.

261
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,264
Speaker 1: There's some.

262
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:41,680
Speaker 1: well, they moved back to Crystal City, right, but it's not the same hotel.

263
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,830
Speaker 1: It's it's that they were in Crystal City before.

264
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,860
Speaker 1: it's like the Gaylord something, right?

265
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:52,299
Speaker 0: But basically a while ago a bunch of high-level staffers resigned kind of out of the blue and you know, we were staff.

266
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,409
Speaker 0: Well, we were staff for katsu khan.

267
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 0: So we were watching everyone.

268
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,880
Speaker 0: you're like all right.

269
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:04,240
Speaker 0: we got to get new staffer for this new staffer for that and everything still seemed to be working out because The main reason we always went to katsu khan was video katsu.

270
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:06,686
Speaker 0: If nothing else went right at that.

271
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:13,186
Speaker 0: khan the video game staff was basically like an entirely separate staff Completely independent of katsu khan.

272
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:17,538
Speaker 1: that was completely awesome and basically had its own gaming convention within.

273
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:20,580
Speaker 0: katsu khan Like those guys had their shit together.

274
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,391
Speaker 0: That was some of the best game like even video gaming.

275
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,640
Speaker 0: like they were on par with Pax enforcers.

276
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,671
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I mean Pax is you know.

277
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:32,920
Speaker 1: to be perfectly honest, you know You go to Pax and Pax is like a big video game convention, right?

278
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:42,489
Speaker 1: but the actual video game playing at Pax is Less than a video game playing that goes on at katsu khan or at least did go on a katsu khan.

279
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:49,350
Speaker 1: They I think Pax had overall, you know less actual, you know consoles to play, you know.

280
00:15:49,430 --> 00:16:01,827
Speaker 1: They had a you know, their system of taking checking games out was kind of nice yeah, but you know, they there are less games to play at Pax and less people playing games in the official game playing areas.

281
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:10,972
Speaker 1: and And katsu khan also always had video topia with like all the awesome arcade machines Pax really didn't have arcade machines at all Really?

282
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:15,610
Speaker 0: Yep, but that that like I mean that the classic arcade games really did it.

283
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,030
Speaker 0: But those people like I gotta give my hats off to video katsu.

284
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,001
Speaker 0: You guys made katsu khan for us amazing every year that we went.

285
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,370
Speaker 1: all two of them except for the and one I was sick.

286
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:30,561
Speaker 0: Well, I went for two previous katsu khan's before you started going But I went to one katsu khan and one sick katsu khan.

287
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:36,066
Speaker 0: those katsu khan's prior to going with you know In the official capacity of geek nights are a drunken haze.

288
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:52,262
Speaker 0: primarily but basically from what we can tell the Staff of katsu khan may or may not have imploded and I believe most of the video game staff has resigned and mass citing various disagreements as to how the count should be run.

289
00:16:52,282 --> 00:17:03,324
Speaker 0: and I I've so many people have emailed us about this within katsu khan and half the people are like, please Uh, you know keep this anonymous, but here's what's going down.

290
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:05,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically drama.

291
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:19,788
Speaker 0: so no a Lot of people asked us why we didn't go to katsu khan last year and there were a lot of reasons But the early rumblings of this were the beginning of it And now that the rumblings are almost peeking out to the surface Now, you know.

292
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:31,909
Speaker 0: so if any of you have any Insight to provide into what happened to the katsu khan staff and what's going to happen at katsu khan next year We would love to hear it and we will not say your name if you tell us not to.

293
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,434
Speaker 1: yeah The thing is right.

294
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:38,110
Speaker 1: It's sort of this self-fulfilling prophecy of you know, whoever katsu khan I guess still exists.

295
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:48,909
Speaker 1: It's still gonna go on You know in some capacity at least as as it stands now, right and there's still people who are working on it and working hard You know to make it happen and they want to be good.

296
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:58,302
Speaker 1: But by you know by having this drama and by announcing this drama is sort of like well Now people are going to avoid katsu khan thinking it's gonna be bad.

297
00:17:58,503 --> 00:17:58,704
Speaker 1: Thus.

298
00:17:58,764 --> 00:17:59,567
Speaker 1: It will be bad.

299
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:07,306
Speaker 0: thus But at the same time if I have a reason to believe that a khan will be bad It's not like as a journalist I can hide that from you.

300
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:07,990
Speaker 1: That's true.

301
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:11,232
Speaker 0: I mean how bad would you feel if I was like yeah katsu khan's coming up It's awesome.

302
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,001
Speaker 0: and then you went and I knew that.

303
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:14,770
Speaker 0: you know, it was having trouble on the back end.

304
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:23,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically go to katsu khan if you're live close and it's not too much trouble and you know continue to listen because as we Figure out more about what's happening.

305
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,170
Speaker 1: There could be you know, these kind of things swing.

306
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,272
Speaker 1: I could be I could be getting on the the show in a few weeks being like Katsu khan.

307
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:33,504
Speaker 1: at a sudden reversal all the shitty people left all the good people came back.

308
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:34,508
Speaker 1: It's a miracle.

309
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:34,990
Speaker 1: It can happen.

310
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:44,770
Speaker 0: Yep, and also obviously if any katsu khan staff are listening Let us know what's going on because we like katsu khan and we would love to help katsu khan continue to be awesome.

311
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,783
Speaker 0: But you can't hide the drama that's happening.

312
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,490
Speaker 0: It is spilling out at the seams.

313
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:54,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like we want katsu khan to be good, but we got to call it like we see it.

314
00:18:54,147 --> 00:19:03,637
Speaker 1: It's not doing good But anyway things of the day.

315
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:04,159
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

316
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:04,982
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

317
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,185
Speaker 1: What do I have?

318
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,570
Speaker 1: Well, do you know?

319
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,360
Speaker 0: cliffhanger That terrible movie.

320
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,245
Speaker 1: I never saw that movie though I do know it exists because I remember back in the day like crazy.

321
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:18,773
Speaker 1: Wasn't it like?

322
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:19,597
Speaker 1: what was it about?

323
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:22,350
Speaker 1: a guy rock climbs and falls down and kills himself something like that.

324
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,981
Speaker 1: I don't know Rocky was in it, right?

325
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:25,230
Speaker 0: I don't actually know.

326
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,670
Speaker 0: I just remember seeing ads for it all the time and the more ads I saw the less I wanted to see the movie.

327
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:40,749
Speaker 1: Well, there was actually a video game an arcade video game from back in the day called cliffhanger two words Right, and I did not know about this game until very recently.

328
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:43,969
Speaker 1: This game was at even though it's very very old.

329
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,101
Speaker 1: This game was a laserdisc game.

330
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,335
Speaker 1: if you've ever played dragon's lair You know what a laserdisc game is.

331
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:53,770
Speaker 1: basically the way these arcade games were anime that ends every five seconds.

332
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:02,910
Speaker 1: Well as you hit up right basically you got a arcade machine and inside the arcade machine was of course a television and A bunch of you know laserdisc videos, right?

333
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,130
Speaker 1: And what happened is these lasers videos would play and you would have to push.

334
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:16,230
Speaker 1: You had a joystick and some buttons and you'd have to push the joystick and buttons in the right way With precise timing in order to get the video to continue.

335
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:26,030
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's sort of you know It's like if you don't push up and push the button right now at this exact precise timing and if you do it He'll swing the sword and kill the dragon.

336
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,210
Speaker 1: If you don't then the dragon will breathe fire and the video is over and you have to put any more quarters to start again.

337
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:34,139
Speaker 1: Right, and that was how a laserdisc game worked.

338
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:51,424
Speaker 1: this particular laserdisc game called cliffhanger right as released in the US Was was pretty much, you know played the exact same way as dragon's lair except Dragon's lair was an original, you know creation for video game purposes, you know this.

339
00:20:51,985 --> 00:21:03,194
Speaker 1: they took footage from various Lupin the third movies, especially Castle of Cagliostro, but also momo Stupid game.

340
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:11,306
Speaker 0: where you'd be you'd have the scene where the him and they're running away when they stole the goat bills in the beginning Of the movie and it's run run run run run jump run run run run jump.

341
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:18,344
Speaker 1: Yep, and They took all this Lupin footage primarily from Cagliostro, but also from others.

342
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,290
Speaker 1: They didn't call it Lupin.

343
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:33,549
Speaker 1: they called it other shit, you know cliffhanger or whatever and it was a laserdisc game just like dragon's lair using this Lupin footage and I really kind of want to play it just to see what the deal is.

344
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:39,646
Speaker 1: But I know it's probably really bad with some really bad voice acting over the Lupin.

345
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:42,829
Speaker 0: if there is any voice acting at all I'm sure there's some way to play it.

346
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,890
Speaker 0: We will have to investigate.

347
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:44,275
Speaker 0: But

348
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:57,249
Speaker 1: this gives me an idea though Right if you could take footage from a bunch of anime that no one in the US had heard of at the time or he's very Few people even well still very few people know what Lupin is in the US And make a video game out of it.

349
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:03,650
Speaker 1: Why don't we take some footage from some like animes put it together and just make some you know games out of it, huh?

350
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:05,094
Speaker 0: You can make some flash games.

351
00:22:05,676 --> 00:22:10,189
Speaker 1: You could just take like some, you know, who knows what but you know make laserdisc style annoying games.

352
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,654
Speaker 0: I Hope that doesn't become.

353
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,445
Speaker 1: I need to make cutscenes for my indie video game.

354
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:17,389
Speaker 1: I'll just steal some animes.

355
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:30,310
Speaker 0: So we know this is anime night and Bongo in comics, but we always often talk about Japanese animation, you know anime but there is animation from countries other than Japan.

356
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:38,620
Speaker 1: I wish we could sum up the Wednesday with a different wording instead of saying anime manga comics because on the one hand right manga is Comics, but you want to put the word manga.

357
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,290
Speaker 1: So people searching for it finds you on Google.

358
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:42,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, and two, right?

359
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:53,541
Speaker 1: It's like sort of the whole visual arts really is what Wednesday is about because there are many many visual arts that are appeal for the geekeries and that's sort of what Wednesday is really all about.

360
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:59,510
Speaker 0: but one place where a lot of great animation comes out of Canada, Canada Canada.

361
00:23:00,594 --> 00:23:04,455
Speaker 0: So I present to you Christopher Hinton's Black fly.

362
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:14,049
Speaker 0: It's the tale of a man who was black flies black fly Okay, a man who was since up with the survey crew in Ontario to build a power.

363
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:24,506
Speaker 0: damn and if you've never been to northern Michigan or Canada or northern Canada, there's a Creature a beast a foul monstrosity called a black fly.

364
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:25,389
Speaker 1: It's a fly.

365
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:35,039
Speaker 0: It is a fly that bites Constantly and repeatedly and never stops black And there are a thousand more to replace it.

366
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:35,901
Speaker 0: Yep.

367
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:38,869
Speaker 0: If you strike it down, it will only become more powerful.

368
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,330
Speaker 0: Yep.

369
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:48,305
Speaker 0: So all that aside we've in many times in the past talked about, you know Well, if we ran anime con do you think the day's over those quick?

370
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:49,330
Speaker 0: All right, we'll do.

371
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:51,459
Speaker 0: That's my thing of the day that animation.

372
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,664
Speaker 0: Okay, the black fly.

373
00:23:52,684 --> 00:24:00,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, Christopher Hinton I thought you're gonna discuss, you know, I thought we were gonna maybe discuss some of how you know Canadian gives money to people to make animations.

374
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,130
Speaker 1: That's why there's all these great Canadian animation bits out there.

375
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,175
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna leave it out there.

376
00:24:04,336 --> 00:24:04,558
Speaker 0: Okay.

377
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,769
Speaker 0: I mean we use space wolf before we didn't talk about that.

378
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:08,777
Speaker 1: I don't think space wolf was Canadian.

379
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,404
Speaker 0: I think the guy who made it was Canadian.

380
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:13,815
Speaker 0: possibly I think Maybe I'm wrong.

381
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:17,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if that was a Canadian, you know government paid for production.

382
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:17,849
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

383
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:26,070
Speaker 1: but I think he happened to be Canadian and remember back in the day like Nickelodeon would show a bunch of the Canadian bits and then Cartoon Network would show a bunch of them.

384
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:28,472
Speaker 1: Any

385
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:31,246
Speaker 0: cartoon network show cartoons, yeah,

386
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:31,769
Speaker 1: all right

387
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:52,190
Speaker 0: But we've often in the past brought up, you know well We do things this way if we ran anime convention or gaming convention or Robert Robert blah and then after we went to PAX we came back and had a whole new perspective on everything and We talked a lot about how great PAX was and how every other convention sucked as a result.

388
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:59,910
Speaker 1: Remember how there was Actually, there was only one ever hubbub at PAX least as far as I know of the guy who runs those other video game conventions.

389
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:01,450
Speaker 0: That guy is great.

390
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:09,904
Speaker 1: He went to PAX to sort of figure out how they ran the convention and tried to copy them and it totally didn't work you know, but they threw him out of PAX cuz of some who knows what.

391
00:25:09,964 --> 00:25:17,949
Speaker 1: but I Feel sort of like we're doing the same thing Like we went to PAX and we succeeded in investigating what they did in that workout where it's suggesting that people copy it.

392
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:21,950
Speaker 1: Well, but the thing is are we are we not too dissimilar from that asshole?

393
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,010
Speaker 0: Well, we're not crazy at least not in that way.

394
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:43,489
Speaker 0: yeah, that guy was crazy, but I think it's more that I had a lot of notions and ideas as to What I thought was wrong with anime conventions and gaming cons, but you know, it's Wednesday we're just gonna talk about anime cons and I thought I knew how to solve those problems or at least I thought I knew what I wanted out of the cons.

395
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,216
Speaker 0: and as A result of getting the problems.

396
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:51,544
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and going to PAX kind of gave me this different perspective that Maybe cons don't have to be in any way like they are now.

397
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:52,950
Speaker 0: we can make radical changes.

398
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:58,530
Speaker 0: But then it kind of sunk in that packs was different for reasons other than the way it is run.

399
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:08,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean whenever we you know, try to solve any world problem, you know big or small We always sort of get back to some sort of fundamental core unsolvable thing, right?

400
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:15,254
Speaker 1: Like we'll be talking about the government like oh they should do this I should they do this and eventually we'll get back to like well Corruption can't?

401
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:23,913
Speaker 1: you know, there it is, you know, you find some core thing that's at the root, you know And you know with with, you know anime conventions and stuff It always be like.

402
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:29,010
Speaker 1: well, they're by fans for fans most of them anyway, and they're all volunteer.

403
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:33,999
Speaker 1: So, you know you can't do this and you can't do that, you know and all these great ideas You can have.

404
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:34,710
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter.

405
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:40,010
Speaker 1: This is root problem and we can never figure out how to solve that root problem because it just it is what it was.

406
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:41,990
Speaker 1: You couldn't turn the convention to be profit.

407
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:43,903
Speaker 1: You couldn't, you know hire a bunch of people.

408
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,010
Speaker 1: that just wasn't feasible.

409
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:50,590
Speaker 1: So all the things that require that are also not feasible and it cascades downwards.

410
00:26:51,173 --> 00:27:01,348
Speaker 1: so you sort of just accept the things of the way they are because you know People already made it the best they could and the core problem that would allow them to change anything is unsolvable Yep.

411
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:02,975
Speaker 0: And there was also the issue.

412
00:27:03,196 --> 00:27:15,649
Speaker 0: I realized after we went to anime Boston that we started going like we always went to the same Few conventions every year when we were just fans or doing like our one panel And then we suddenly started going to a whole ton of cons and that killed us.

413
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:19,550
Speaker 0: So then we backed it off and then we kind of just went to the same cons every year.

414
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,908
Speaker 0: And it wasn't until we went to PAX that we broke it up.

415
00:27:22,372 --> 00:27:22,493
Speaker 0: Like.

416
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,075
Speaker 0: that was when we went to something different for a change Yep.

417
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:40,530
Speaker 0: And then on the heels of that we went to anime Boston and after anime Boston I realized that my view of cons was highly skewed by the fact that my sample size was basically Kineticon, Otakon, Katsu-Kan, which are all very similar.

418
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:50,808
Speaker 0: of course Otakon is pulling away from the pack more and more and Kineticon is being more and more of a Not anime con but a generic generic on which I think actually suits us very well.

419
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:52,725
Speaker 1: to be honest Yeah, that's what Kineticon should be.

420
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:57,969
Speaker 0: Yep I'm actually really excited about Kineticon this year Which is the weekend after the weekend after Otakon.

421
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,710
Speaker 1: So there's a weekend after Otakon that nothing happens and the weekend after that Kineticon.

422
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,389
Speaker 0: And again, of course, we're gonna be there doing all the panels.

423
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,930
Speaker 1: Yeah in one room there's going to be a room that is the rim and sky room.

424
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:17,150
Speaker 0: Well, the you know, the geek nights front row crew room It's about 50% me and Scott 50% the rest of the crew.

425
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:22,890
Speaker 1: So even if the rest of Kineticon is poop Which I guarantee it won't be because the tabletop gaming there is excellent

426
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:32,762
Speaker 0: see if we could just take the tabletop gaming from Kineticon and merge it with the tabletop gaming from PAX and just have Video cards to run gaming at PAX

427
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:33,706
Speaker 1: the ultimate game con.

428
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:34,489
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

429
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,850
Speaker 1: anyway.

430
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:41,799
Speaker 1: So if you're worried that Kineticon is gonna be you know If it's not worth going or worth going.

431
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:47,849
Speaker 1: you should go because the worst case scenario You can play tabletop games play RPGs and hang with us.

432
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:48,573
Speaker 1: we're all.

433
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:56,173
Speaker 1: we're gonna be doing a panel pretty much every minute of the con and You will not need to worry if the rest of the con is good or bad And you know what?

434
00:28:56,213 --> 00:29:03,855
Speaker 1: There's a chance that some of the other things at the con will be good even if some of them are bad so Guaranteed because of us.

435
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:08,230
Speaker 1: you could think of it as like there's a. there's a geek night's convention inside of Kineticon.

436
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,340
Speaker 1: You can think about it that way.

437
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:14,702
Speaker 0: Wow, you know Every year when we talk about conventions, we always kind of ever.

438
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:17,350
Speaker 0: I think it's ever since you honest ever since.

439
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:18,630
Speaker 1: We're not gonna lie to our people.

440
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:23,529
Speaker 0: We we talked about how excited we were for Wario where we before it came out.

441
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:24,794
Speaker 0: No one ever.

442
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:25,657
Speaker 0: let us live that down.

443
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:27,463
Speaker 0: So we're always very guarded in our opinions now.

444
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:29,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, Katsu con might suck I don't know.

445
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,185
Speaker 0: Yeah Otakon might be cool.

446
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:31,649
Speaker 1: We don't know.

447
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,296
Speaker 1: Better than be see.

448
00:29:33,497 --> 00:29:36,570
Speaker 1: it's good though because now that builds a trust with the listeners.

449
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,576
Speaker 1: They know that we're not just shills, right?

450
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:43,610
Speaker 1: There are other people out there, you know podcasters and other types in various media.

451
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:44,196
Speaker 1: We're like.

452
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:47,838
Speaker 1: if someone's a sponsor Like they will never bad talk them.

453
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:56,147
Speaker 1: or if they have a business partnership with someone they'll always say they're great Even if they don't really like them, you know the that that much, you know this story or the.

454
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:57,090
Speaker 1: at least they'll keep their mouth.

455
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:59,671
Speaker 1: You know We.

456
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:05,809
Speaker 1: you know, if someone's a friend of ours, you know, or we have a relationship with someone if there's something bad We'll say it, you know.

457
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:11,310
Speaker 1: And I think because people trust us in that way and we we live up to that trust that will you know?

458
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,469
Speaker 1: Our listeners will stick with us and know that we're awesome.

459
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:21,442
Speaker 0: That is part of the reason why I did bring up the Katsu con thing at this early stage because one it means there's enough Time for Katsu gone to fix things but to yeah Katsu got it.

460
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:22,225
Speaker 1: That's one thing.

461
00:30:22,265 --> 00:30:23,290
Speaker 1: to Katsu cons credit, right?

462
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,610
Speaker 1: They're having all this drama now, but their convention is a ways out.

463
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,693
Speaker 1: It's in like February.

464
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:36,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, so most conventions like, you know at this point in time, you know over six months before the convention They would just wouldn't be saying anything at all.

465
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:40,609
Speaker 1: There'd be no communication between any of the people whatsoever at most conventions.

466
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:46,990
Speaker 1: So Even though the communication at Katsu con is negative its communication and that is a positive a huge positive.

467
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:49,904
Speaker 0: Yep, the fact that anyone's even talking that shows you that cause.

468
00:30:49,944 --> 00:31:00,344
Speaker 0: it kind of had its act together But to way back when we went to Connecticut and it wasn't so great years and years ago And we did a show basically lambasting the con like and at all these problems.

469
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:01,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, we still go to it every year.

470
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because the con share and all a lot of the staffers email doesn't know.

471
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:07,037
Speaker 0: you know what you're right Put up or shut up.

472
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:08,829
Speaker 0: You want to help us fix it and we were like hells.

473
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, and kinetic on has been like our standby con ever since.

474
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:12,904
Speaker 1: Yep.

475
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:14,550
Speaker 0: So I'm hoping the same thing will happen.

476
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:15,808
Speaker 1: It's also helps it really close.

477
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll pretty much go to any con that's within an hour of my house.

478
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,610
Speaker 1: Well, we never go to those ones that are up at the the colleges and Poughkeepsie like the non-con.

479
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:28,319
Speaker 0: Well, we went to a gaming for hope twice.

480
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:29,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't go to non-con though.

481
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:30,426
Speaker 0: No, we didn't.

482
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:30,807
Speaker 1: Okay.

483
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:32,632
Speaker 0: I Was lying.

484
00:31:32,652 --> 00:31:33,134
Speaker 0: What do you want?

485
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:33,635
Speaker 0: All right.

486
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:36,101
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I think we should just start.

487
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:56,887
Speaker 0: basically we're gonna try to aggregate all of the complaints and suggestions and commentary we've had about the meta of anime conventions and just anime conventions into one show and pull it all together rather than having You know one mention in every show for a year that no one can really pull into a coherent plan forward.

488
00:31:57,288 --> 00:32:01,590
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And that's the rationale the real reason we're doing the show.

489
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:04,196
Speaker 0: Scott hasn't watched giant robo yet.

490
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:06,063
Speaker 0: I haven't watched all of Galaxy Express yet.

491
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:08,050
Speaker 1: You're never gonna watch off Galaxy Express.

492
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:08,571
Speaker 0: I will.

493
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,678
Speaker 1: I'm on episode 60 something.

494
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,343
Speaker 1: It's a hundred and twelve.

495
00:32:12,403 --> 00:32:14,470
Speaker 0: I think Scott watch all the Sailor Moon and we'll talk.

496
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:15,455
Speaker 1: It's not gonna happen.

497
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:16,400
Speaker 0: Not that bad a show.

498
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,064
Speaker 1: not that gonna happen.

499
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:18,089
Speaker 0: It's really not that bad a show.

500
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,679
Speaker 1: Yet neither I've watched a lot of things.

501
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:23,810
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm gonna watch that many episodes I've watched worse shows longer.

502
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:25,098
Speaker 0: So, all right.

503
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:26,467
Speaker 1: Well watch gal guy guy.

504
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:31,949
Speaker 0: then Maybe I should start in the middle of gal guy guy like people say yeah, it's up to you.

505
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:43,285
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I think we should start with the simplest or the least controversial or the obvious and then work our way to the crazy Because the simplest and most obvious that anime Boston already does.

506
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:44,329
Speaker 0: so we know this one works.

507
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:50,110
Speaker 0: Have the cosplay feedback be opposite the real con feedback on Sunday.

508
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:53,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you go to a feedback panel, right?

509
00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:01,406
Speaker 1: And it's good to have a feedback panel because you know Basically if people give you feedback by email or internets it gets lost.

510
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:02,951
Speaker 1: people don't check it Whatever.

511
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:03,192
Speaker 1: well

512
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:17,614
Speaker 0: to having the feedback at the con gives the people who are pissed off and have a legitimate concern or not That immediate venting which will and often they'll feel a lot better about coming to the con next year knowing that a person listened to Them and said we'll work on

513
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:17,735
Speaker 1: it.

514
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:18,035
Speaker 1: Yep.

515
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:23,930
Speaker 1: I mean, you know other conventions like, you know, professional ones that are freaking feedback.

516
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:25,219
Speaker 1: It's like what are you talking?

517
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,326
Speaker 1: a feedback fan?

518
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:26,749
Speaker 1: I'll get it.

519
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:32,198
Speaker 0: packs ended and Everyone walked out and the police were behind.

520
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,988
Speaker 0: Well, the guards were behind the last straggler saying get out.

521
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,610
Speaker 1: Yep There's no feedback.

522
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:40,103
Speaker 1: It's like they don't need you to tell them that they're awesome.

523
00:33:40,223 --> 00:33:43,937
Speaker 0: and after the last Otakon We finally said look get rid of con feedback.

524
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:48,149
Speaker 0: No professional cons have it and it's just cosplay people and no one else.

525
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:56,110
Speaker 0: and Anime Boston just split them which I think is great because I feel like the cosplay people do need a forum like this.

526
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,887
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it is is at a fan run con that is by fans.

527
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:03,525
Speaker 1: for fans You sort of have more of a right.

528
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:04,510
Speaker 1: It's sort of weird, right?

529
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:10,010
Speaker 1: You think you would actually have less of a right to feedback because basically everyone's volunteering and just doing this for you.

530
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:12,429
Speaker 1: So who are you to tell them that they did something wrong?

531
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:15,601
Speaker 1: But but and like at a professional con you're paying for that.

532
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:17,909
Speaker 1: You should be able to feedback a ton, right?

533
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:22,170
Speaker 1: It's like you can complain about software you paid for but you can't complain about open source software.

534
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:28,389
Speaker 1: But at the same time it's like, you know a fan run con, you know, like Otakon you're technically a member.

535
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:31,039
Speaker 1: You know, this is like you're in this group.

536
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:34,290
Speaker 1: You have you know, you're in this just as much as everyone else is.

537
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,830
Speaker 1: It's not like they're providing a service for you.

538
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,909
Speaker 1: It's like you're in this with everyone else and you have a say part of it, too.

539
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:46,850
Speaker 0: Is that fan cons unlike professional cons have the very clear put up or shut up where you're coming to the con?

540
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,540
Speaker 0: You're not different from the staffers.

541
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:50,130
Speaker 0: You're just not staffing.

542
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:56,268
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're there in the same capacity as those people but if you have a complaint join up and fix it.

543
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,586
Speaker 0: We'll get to why that doesn't work as well as it should.

544
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,335
Speaker 0: Reasons as to why.

545
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:03,664
Speaker 1: yeah, so yeah, so feedback.

546
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:21,179
Speaker 1: if you put the masquerade feedback which is the majority of the feedback on its own a the masquerade runners will be there to hear it right and B those masquerade people won't bother the rest of the people because really the masquerade at an anime convention is Separate from the rest of the convention.

547
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,230
Speaker 0: It's basically a completely separate event.

548
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:34,140
Speaker 0: I mean the people who are doing that tend to be there for that and their whole group of friends will like like everyone they know has a skit and then they all go and watch each Other skits and they all go to all the stuff

549
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:38,019
Speaker 1: and then they do the cosplay chess and they do Right, and that that's basically.

550
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:38,803
Speaker 1: it's a convention.

551
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:41,296
Speaker 1: within a convention, you know It's a whole a lot of can.

552
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:44,030
Speaker 1: there are some conventions out there that have tracks, right?

553
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:49,810
Speaker 1: It's like you go to a tech convention and they'll be like say, you know different tracks for different, you know technologies.

554
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:59,070
Speaker 1: So everyone wants to learn about X goes to be this set of events and anyone else about why it goes to these set of events and anime conventions and geek conventions.

555
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:08,286
Speaker 1: Definitely don't have tracks in this sort of structured way where you pick a set of events and go to them But what they do, you know, they sort of have these virtual tracks of.

556
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:09,310
Speaker 1: you know, you know.

557
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:26,684
Speaker 1: Hey, if you're into this, you know, then you're gonna do these things, you know Some people just go and they do the video game room the whole con and it's sort of a track You know, they do all the tournaments and some people they go and they do all the cosplay stuff They do, you know, the the photos and the the show and the whole thing.

558
00:36:26,745 --> 00:36:28,410
Speaker 1: That's a track in a way.

559
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:34,350
Speaker 0: Actually, I will later in this we'll get to tracks because I have a lot of ideas about tracks and anime cons.

560
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:38,430
Speaker 0: It's one thing that is it is their de facto, but not de jure.

561
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:39,834
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

562
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:42,741
Speaker 1: You summed up what I was saying before and many fewer words.

563
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:49,208
Speaker 1: Yes that we're all French Latin, whatever It's a Latin language.

564
00:36:50,682 --> 00:36:53,799
Speaker 0: But That actually that's a really good example of.

565
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:57,092
Speaker 0: you know, one of those things were originally our idea was yeah get rid of it Stupid.

566
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,350
Speaker 0: but then going to anime Boston we saw no there's a better way.

567
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:03,670
Speaker 0: Okay, so what else should we change other than the demographic?

568
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,247
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

569
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:10,457
Speaker 1: I mean One thing is definitely the.

570
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,910
Speaker 1: it's tough to figure out the scheduling of panels.

571
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:19,810
Speaker 1: You know, like we've been trying to look at this and it's like, you know They leave the gaps in between the panels.

572
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:26,126
Speaker 0: Literally, there is a panel and then a panel sized hole and then a panel and a panel sized hole

573
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:31,605
Speaker 1: and some of them stagger the Panels and some of them line them up next to each other and some of the one

574
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:34,847
Speaker 0: thing that almost no anime con does is have gaps between panels.

575
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:45,950
Speaker 0: and no, anime con has effectively been able to get people out of the rooms in a professional manner such that the next panelists are Just ready to go exactly on time.

576
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean at most conventions, right?

577
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,201
Speaker 1: It's like that.

578
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:50,305
Speaker 1: the problem is different.

579
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:51,690
Speaker 1: for example at Otakon, right?

580
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:58,649
Speaker 1: You have a situation where a panel room be full The next panel is popular and people are waiting in line for it outside the room.

581
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:03,910
Speaker 1: So you have to empty out this room and then let the people in for the next panel.

582
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:09,570
Speaker 1: But yeah Otakon also has all the panels scheduled right on top of each other with no gaps.

583
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:10,929
Speaker 1: So they need the gap.

584
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,986
Speaker 0: Well more so - there's the very serious problem of.

585
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:22,050
Speaker 0: I mean There are two ways to look at this on one hand people will go to a panel They don't care about because it is in the room of the panel that comes next that they want to see

586
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:22,551
Speaker 1: Yeah,

587
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:27,470
Speaker 0: and two there are people who want to go to two panels that happen to be next to each other in the same room.

588
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,701
Speaker 0: Yep, and there is no elegant solution to any of that.

589
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:33,310
Speaker 0: No except tracks, but we'll get to that again.

590
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:41,590
Speaker 0: But I think you really have to do panel scheduling based entirely on the specific con and the specific needs of the specific.

591
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:41,971
Speaker 0: There's.

592
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:42,292
Speaker 0: no.

593
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:47,470
Speaker 1: yeah Boston, you never need to clear out the panel room, you know, there's plenty of seats.

594
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:50,020
Speaker 1: the old people just come in and come out as they please.

595
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,983
Speaker 1: you don't have this problem.

596
00:38:51,023 --> 00:38:55,523
Speaker 1: and actually an anime Boston every panel I Saw and even though they were stacked on top of each other.

597
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:56,910
Speaker 1: They all ended on time.

598
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,649
Speaker 1: Nobody stayed too long or anything like that.

599
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:02,510
Speaker 0: But Otakon has the problem where there are a ton of panels where?

600
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,803
Speaker 0: You will not fit everyone who wants to see that panel into the room.

601
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:07,410
Speaker 0: You have to clear the room out.

602
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:14,978
Speaker 0: you Otakon specifically really needs to have the half-hour break between Every single panel and they.

603
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,470
Speaker 1: the thing is then you've got a situation of quantity and quality.

604
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:24,366
Speaker 1: You know by stacking all the panels up on top of each other you can get the quantity in there and you can get something for everybody.

605
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:30,501
Speaker 1: if you Put all those gaps in unless you have more panel rooms There's going to be less panels.

606
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:34,321
Speaker 1: and if there are less panels You're gonna have to give some of them the axe.

607
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:35,528
Speaker 1: and what do you do now?

608
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,942
Speaker 1: You've got all this time periods right with fewer panels occupying people.

609
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:42,550
Speaker 1: all the people are coming to the convention.

610
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,997
Speaker 1: There's less for them to do.

611
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:51,110
Speaker 0: there's gonna be more time where they're wandering about doing nothing Which Otakon has the huge problem with just because the BCC can barely contain it.

612
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but other other convention, you know, it's a problem in Otakon.

613
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,530
Speaker 1: It's not really a problem in other places so much at all.

614
00:39:57,651 --> 00:40:00,862
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really depends on the con but for very large cons like Otakon

615
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:10,510
Speaker 1: actually Pax did have the room emptying problem but you know where the rooms that every panel would completely fill up and they'd have to empty it out and let all new people in And then it would fill up and not everyone to see the panel.

616
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:14,684
Speaker 1: But they had huge gaps between the panels and they had less quality and less.

617
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,250
Speaker 1: less quantity and more quality.

618
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:17,755
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a problem.

619
00:40:18,036 --> 00:40:31,941
Speaker 0: now one thing I would do if I'm gonna schedule things back to back or even with short gaps between them is have tracks of related panel stuff at anime cons, maybe even have Recommended itineraries in the con book.

620
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:34,210
Speaker 0: Like if you're the guy I don't know all the neck.

621
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think you could logistically go so far as to have people register for individual panel.

622
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:39,750
Speaker 0: No, no, no not register.

623
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,646
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say that either but I'm just saying I don't think you could do that.

624
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:54,970
Speaker 1: That'd be ridiculous But you definitely what you have to do is when you're scheduling the panels you have to think Really really hard about the different types of fans and say okay if there was a fan of this, right?

625
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,110
Speaker 1: You know this kind of person is probably gonna go to these panels.

626
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,599
Speaker 1: So don't put them next to each other at the same time

627
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:13,048
Speaker 0: or put them next to each other one after the other with no room clear and Made like no somehow in the schedule that these two are a block and that if you want to be guaranteed to see the second One you have to go to the first one.

628
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there was someone a mark on the schedule, you know, see the thing.

629
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,090
Speaker 1: would people really get it, you know I mean you could mark in the schedule.

630
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:22,110
Speaker 1: These are times in the room is cleared out.

631
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,288
Speaker 1: These are times of the room is not.

632
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:35,559
Speaker 0: well Every con that does room clearings does that but very rarely do they actually follow their room cleaning clearing schedule consistently or Really do they enforce the room clear thoroughly.

633
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,350
Speaker 0: more importantly they will not schedule enough time to clear the room.

634
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:40,404
Speaker 1: That is also true.

635
00:41:41,493 --> 00:41:44,729
Speaker 0: But I feel like Otakon should have simple solution straight up.

636
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:50,990
Speaker 0: There should be a half-hour stagger between every single panel except for linked track panels.

637
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:53,322
Speaker 0: Yep, so you might have two panels less panels.

638
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:01,910
Speaker 1: Well, you gotta get more panel rooms or just you know, you'll have better quality and no one will really complain so much.

639
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,339
Speaker 0: Well, I have a solution to that too.

640
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:18,870
Speaker 0: But before we get to that talking about tracks I think cons like Otakon should have a section in the con book maybe not on the you know fold out schedule, but in the con book of Have like ten different personalities like staffers whoever who look at the schedule and pick their suggested track.

641
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,398
Speaker 0: I'm Joey Jojo the mecha man.

642
00:42:22,658 --> 00:42:26,250
Speaker 0: I like fisted the North Star and all my goddess and mech shows.

643
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,719
Speaker 1: So I was like, I'm the mecha man.

644
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:40,159
Speaker 0: I like Show him drama You make you know, like in the old PC gamer and all those magazines you have personalities Yep, either fictitious or real doesn't matter.

645
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:50,095
Speaker 0: and then you say like if I were that person I would go to these events and have a full weekend-long con schedule event event event event Even with like lunch blocked out.

646
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:54,510
Speaker 0: Mmm and have like ten of these in a special section in the back of the con book.

647
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:59,102
Speaker 0: And you could get fans to do this for you if you release the schedule early enough.

648
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:07,658
Speaker 1: and also when you're when you're crafting these Craft them such that you know Such that right if you know.

649
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:09,163
Speaker 1: say you have ten of them, right?

650
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:13,137
Speaker 1: Just pretend, you know Obviously, it's not gonna work out this way ever.

651
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,550
Speaker 1: just pretend that ten percent of the convention picked each one, right?

652
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,511
Speaker 1: That's adding up to 100%.

653
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:26,078
Speaker 1: Craft them in such a way that if that were the case the traffic flow and all those other factors Come in line.

654
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,143
Speaker 0: I will say awesome.

655
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:28,470
Speaker 0: That is impossible.

656
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:32,867
Speaker 1: I know it's impossible, but you should keep those sorts of things in mind when crafting.

657
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,049
Speaker 1: see, you know You know, you're obviously never gonna get it.

658
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:38,190
Speaker 1: I feel like it doesn't hurt to think about it.

659
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:47,230
Speaker 0: See I've you know having scheduled one room for the entirety of convention I have decided that that level of planning is currently impossible for anime cons.

660
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:50,985
Speaker 1: You said to think hard about it that if you have enough time, you can do it.

661
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,270
Speaker 0: There aren't enough resources.

662
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:53,518
Speaker 1: It's one person.

663
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:54,122
Speaker 1: This is that.

664
00:43:54,142 --> 00:43:55,410
Speaker 1: sit there and think and look at it.

665
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:09,810
Speaker 0: I just think for a kind like Otakon specifically the much better solution really go all out publish the schedule for panel or the whole con schedule either early to the staff or If you have holes in the schedule where you won't you won't have it ready in time.

666
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:13,190
Speaker 0: You know kind of wing it and leave gaps and there are a bunch of ways to do this.

667
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:22,068
Speaker 0: But either have a contest to create the schedule for an individual person, you know The mecha man itinerary or just have dedicated staffers do it.

668
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:26,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, be like, you know Scott suggested convention schedule rims suggested.

669
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:32,850
Speaker 1: Maybe we should make you know, go to get different conventions and then just post like our suggested schedules.

670
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:36,441
Speaker 0: Yeah rims Suggested in Scott even to start for cons.

671
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:38,490
Speaker 0: they can't get this done early enough to print in the con book.

672
00:44:38,891 --> 00:44:46,791
Speaker 0: Put it online whenever you can make a big deal about it point people toward it in the forum and everything and then Print out, you know The.

673
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:53,010
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go look at the Otakon pre-schedule and I'm gonna post my suggested schedule in the front crew forum.

674
00:44:53,213 --> 00:44:54,210
Speaker 0: I will post mine as well.

675
00:44:54,250 --> 00:45:02,780
Speaker 1: We'll start this and I if I was at Otakon and I want it and I'm going to assume a I'm going to Otakon Be I'm not doing any panels.

676
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,025
Speaker 1: I'm only going to them.

677
00:45:04,085 --> 00:45:05,150
Speaker 0: see we're ourselves.

678
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:11,250
Speaker 1: Yes, see I'm myself and D I'm going to want to do a convention thing at every moment.

679
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,150
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna put artists alley in my schedule.

680
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,708
Speaker 1: I'm gonna put video game in this get you know.

681
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:19,930
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna never gonna leave like an empty time or I'm just chilling out cuz I paid for Otakon.

682
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,830
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do something at every moment possible, you know, so I just think this is a great idea.

683
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:32,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, so let's let's post our schedules our virtual schedules that we're not actually going to follow but what you know our suggested schedules.

684
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:44,750
Speaker 0: Now in terms of panel rooms and needing more panel rooms if you stagger the panels Cons not need to either get rid of the video showing rooms at least the generic ones or completely redo them.

685
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:49,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean other conventions that aren't anime conventions don't really have video showing room.

686
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,970
Speaker 1: Well, they might have a theater that shows like special events like it.

687
00:45:53,070 --> 00:46:06,070
Speaker 0: You know a comic con know what a lot of cons will have is they'll have showing rooms But those rooms are special like they show Like they'll have just weird stuff like here's a bunch of 80s TV shows and then we're showing rocky horror and then whatever.

688
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean like look at the New York Comic Con, right?

689
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,550
Speaker 1: They have a theater and in that theater, they show special Hollywood shit.

690
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,422
Speaker 1: That is for the con, you know and some of it you have not to pay for.

691
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:17,410
Speaker 1: yeah, and that's what they do.

692
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,031
Speaker 1: They don't have like showing rooms Like.

693
00:46:19,272 --> 00:46:24,369
Speaker 1: yeah, we've just got like five video screens and these five little theaters coming and just sit down and watch at your.

694
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:26,239
Speaker 1: you know Leisure, they don't have that shit.

695
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:30,170
Speaker 0: now very specifically again I'll just keep using Otakon because it's the easiest example.

696
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:35,690
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's because Otakon actually has all these things and is so big and that's you know.

697
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:40,567
Speaker 0: We've been to it since every year so - now we've actually pitched this idea to every count we go to.

698
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:48,331
Speaker 0: and well It'll probably happen at Kinetic on 2010 and it may happen at anime Boston 2010.

699
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:50,401
Speaker 0: We're still you know, this is all still in planning stage.

700
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:54,400
Speaker 1: We have not done this at a convention yet So I don't even know if it would work, but I think it would.

701
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:04,195
Speaker 0: I'm pretty confident but our plan is to one Drastically cut down on the anime showing rooms and keep the rooms like Otakon's video 5 Consistently amazes me.

702
00:47:04,236 --> 00:47:05,924
Speaker 1: Well Otakon needs to keep the 35 millimeter.

703
00:47:05,944 --> 00:47:10,830
Speaker 1: Yes They got to keep one big one for the AMVs and such right?

704
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:18,909
Speaker 1: They got to keep the live-action one Yeah, and they have to keep one that shows like all the stuff the industry wants to show, you know They bring all their new releases and such.

705
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:29,670
Speaker 0: but what I would do for every other anime showing room the ones that otherwise would just be showing like The first four episodes of Harvey and then like the I got his movie and all these rooms are right.

706
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:45,503
Speaker 1: These rooms do serve a purpose at the convention now which is basically get people out of the hallway and sitting in a seat and out of the way and All they do is just have video showing constantly non-stop Just keep showing new videos and people just keep going in and watching them.

707
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:55,547
Speaker 1: and that's all these rooms do and I guess you know, it serves a purpose but There is a significant improvement that could be made to greatly enhance the experience.

708
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:56,450
Speaker 0: now, it's very simple.

709
00:47:56,651 --> 00:48:01,230
Speaker 0: All you do is schedule the video room exactly like you would a panel room.

710
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,499
Speaker 0: So every showing isn't just the name of the show.

711
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:04,383
Speaker 0: description of the show.

712
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,130
Speaker 0: every showing is an event.

713
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:13,266
Speaker 0: So say at 11 o'clock and then at night on Saturday, we're showing Lupin the third castle of Cagliostro.

714
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:13,608
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

715
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:29,283
Speaker 0: So it's scheduled there but in the schedule we block it out for the movie Plus like a half-hour Yep, or and after and the description shows first, you know describes no The Miyazaki Ghibli Lupin the third movie.

716
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:30,327
Speaker 0: a little bit description.

717
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:31,150
Speaker 1: What was it Ghibli?

718
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,869
Speaker 1: I think it was just Miyazaki directed it.

719
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,789
Speaker 0: I think it was just Miyazaki, but anyway good question not to look that up.

720
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:42,130
Speaker 0: You you show that you say, you know, this is the movie we're showing and then you also include information about it.

721
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:49,557
Speaker 0: You know some sort of meta information, but you sell it not as just a showing but as a panel To where it's going to be.

722
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:50,341
Speaker 0: MC the per.

723
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:52,430
Speaker 0: someone in the room is going to introduce the film.

724
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:53,935
Speaker 0: Talk about it a bit.

725
00:48:54,196 --> 00:48:55,401
Speaker 0: Maybe take a couple of questions.

726
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:57,670
Speaker 0: I'm talking 15 minutes to a half hour of.

727
00:48:58,431 --> 00:48:59,334
Speaker 0: This is what this is.

728
00:48:59,374 --> 00:49:00,498
Speaker 0: This is why it's important.

729
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:01,803
Speaker 0: This is why it's cool.

730
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,630
Speaker 0: This is why you're here and check it out.

731
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:07,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know 10 minutes might even be enough depending on how much there is to say about.

732
00:49:07,689 --> 00:49:08,839
Speaker 0: so Yeah, it depends on.

733
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,110
Speaker 1: they could talk about the directors.

734
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:15,390
Speaker 1: They could talk about the history of it the year it came out any interesting stories that are related to it.

735
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,570
Speaker 1: You know, just really tell people what you know.

736
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:24,148
Speaker 1: Make sure you're explaining to them all the in this meta information about what they are about to see.

737
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:28,630
Speaker 1: and now First of all, people are gonna be a lot more excited about what they're about to watch.

738
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,699
Speaker 1: They can be a lot more interested.

739
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:30,930
Speaker 1: They're gonna know what to look for.

740
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,149
Speaker 1: They're gonna have a proper context for what they're about to see.

741
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:36,470
Speaker 1: They're not gonna walk into a room and look for two seconds of the screen.

742
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:39,970
Speaker 1: You know, of course all the people who show up in the middle of the showing are still gonna do this.

743
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,589
Speaker 1: But if someone shows up in the beginning, they're not gonna be like, okay this what's this?

744
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:48,858
Speaker 1: Look at it and be like I screw this, you know They're actually gonna be like, oh, I know.

745
00:49:48,878 --> 00:49:52,089
Speaker 1: they'll know after you while you're talking to them at this time They want to watch or not.

746
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:57,130
Speaker 1: And if they decide they like it and odds are they will because you're gonna talk it up real big.

747
00:49:57,712 --> 00:50:00,283
Speaker 1: You're gonna get those people to sit in their seat for the whole showing.

748
00:50:00,303 --> 00:50:07,867
Speaker 1: and then after the showing You have another block of time before the next one and you discuss what you just saw with the audience.

749
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:10,321
Speaker 0: people ask questions I mean ghosts in the shell.

750
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:16,029
Speaker 0: you show that at the end You talk about what that really meant and you talk a little bit about Shiro versus oshi.

751
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:17,497
Speaker 1: Yeah Did you guys like that?

752
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:18,703
Speaker 1: Did you not like it?

753
00:50:18,764 --> 00:50:19,850
Speaker 1: You know, what part did you like?

754
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,894
Speaker 1: What part did you not like?

755
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:26,282
Speaker 1: everyone can start talking it up and it's a good way for everyone to you know Connect and all this good stuff.

756
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:31,219
Speaker 0: Now that is just kind of phase one That is the fastest quickest simplest least effort least.

757
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,559
Speaker 1: all it requires is a person per video room Per show.

758
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,070
Speaker 1: you don't need to sit there for the whole show.

759
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:44,689
Speaker 1: All you need is a person who knows about each show to go in and talk about it before and after and that's it.

760
00:50:45,115 --> 00:50:45,869
Speaker 1: It's real easy.

761
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:52,829
Speaker 0: Now the next phase of this would be to in addition to showings like that because you know, we do our animation see panel.

762
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,102
Speaker 0: So if Otacon had stuff like that we could say so.

763
00:50:56,483 --> 00:51:04,136
Speaker 0: if you want to learn more about these shows giant robo is being shown and discussed at four o'clock on Friday and You know the pond.

764
00:51:04,156 --> 00:51:05,601
Speaker 0: the third is being shown at this time.

765
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:08,090
Speaker 0: and then sky crawlers are being shown at this time.

766
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:08,780
Speaker 0: Check it all out.

767
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:09,348
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

768
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:22,948
Speaker 0: but the next phase is to have panels in the video rooms that are primarily clip driven or even Commentary like a. say someone does a showing of Satoshi khan's paprika and it's just they introduce it.

769
00:51:22,988 --> 00:51:25,215
Speaker 0: They show it they're done Later in the con.

770
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:46,309
Speaker 0: there's a separate event where maybe they do a Satoshi khan panel and they show you Either clips from all of his movies and talk about them and point stuff out or they take Paprika that they already showed earlier in the con kind of show all these different scenes from it point out what's important point out the Animation point out stuff in the background kind of analyze it the way that film professors at like NYU do you know?

771
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:55,250
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, there are already panels like this that are done in panel rooms, you know Lots of you know video heavy panels, but they're always constrained by time.

772
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:00,710
Speaker 1: They're always constrained by time and you know video in the panel rooms is usually not so great.

773
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:07,230
Speaker 1: If you moved all the video heavy panels to the video rooms It would increase the quality of the video rooms greatly

774
00:52:07,771 --> 00:52:08,654
Speaker 0: Right and also to

775
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:11,702
Speaker 1: free up space in the panel rooms for more panels

776
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:20,106
Speaker 0: and it also shifts the focus of the panel to Show it to me and tell me what I'm seeing as opposed to show me a little bit and then talk a whole bunch.

777
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,292
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and Like.

778
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:31,469
Speaker 0: the really cool side effect of this is that I have got a lot of really cool film professors who are all About going to a con like Otacon and doing this.

779
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:31,690
Speaker 0: Yeah,

780
00:52:32,032 --> 00:52:55,546
Speaker 1: and also there are a lot of panels that could not happen but could happen if this were implemented, you know Yes, there's a lot of impossible infeasible panels that would now be possible, you know Like, you know, for example, someone might want to show something like I don't know I'm Trying to think something that's you know, like like maybe like memories, right and you know, it's.

781
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:58,578
Speaker 1: it's not too long But it's not you know, super long either.

782
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,655
Speaker 1: so you could show it and you could really you know Talk about like the whole thing.

783
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:09,300
Speaker 1: a lot of you know, if you wanted to discuss say magnetic rows in a panel right now You know, you couldn't really show the whole thing in your panel.

784
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:16,009
Speaker 1: It's too much for your panel would eat up all the time and You know you basically to show clips from it, you know and just keep them short.

785
00:53:16,552 --> 00:53:28,730
Speaker 1: But if you had a video room and you had a whole bunch of time a couple hours even just you know an hour and Change instead of 45 minutes to an hour You could show the whole thing in the dark then turn the lights back on and then discuss it.

786
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,160
Speaker 0: And the best example of this was way back.

787
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,990
Speaker 0: I visited one of Emily's lectures that NYU, you know.

788
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:58,050
Speaker 0: She went to film school in New York City at New York University and I sat in on a lecture where the previous Showing they had shown all of citizen Kane and then in the lecture they kind of walked through the entire movie showing clips and then the professor would show the clip talk about it maybe show it again and It was amazing and I saw citizen Kane in an entirely different light after that lecture.

789
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:10,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took one film class at RIT With this really smart dude and basically, you know, the class was twice a week But also once a week we had to go watch a movie in the web and that's basically you know, how it went down.

790
00:54:11,451 --> 00:54:16,785
Speaker 1: Hey, you know 20 classes and 10 movies in 10 weeks now Oda Khan.

791
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:18,530
Speaker 0: I direct this to you specifically.

792
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:29,014
Speaker 0: We can get you real film professors who are also huge anime fans who will probably come to Oda Khan And do this for you.

793
00:54:29,194 --> 00:54:34,156
Speaker 0: All you have to do is give us the room and we'll do it Like we've.

794
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:34,698
Speaker 0: we're all set.

795
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,341
Speaker 0: We're like.

796
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,090
Speaker 0: we think this is a solid gold idea.

797
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:45,257
Speaker 0: Alright and Even it, you know any con not just Oda Khan, even if you can't get the film professors to do these crazy You know very well prepared clip panels.

798
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:53,265
Speaker 0: You can have someone at least say who directed a show and why it's awesome Mm-hmm, and you know look at a show like giant robo.

799
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:54,330
Speaker 0: giant robo.

800
00:54:54,853 --> 00:55:01,869
Speaker 0: If you don't have someone to kind of give you context as to what this is You're about to see you might look at it and go this is stupid and walk out of the room.

801
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:16,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of shows out there that just need Information and most people at the con aren't gonna get don't know that information and they're not gonna get it unless someone tells it To him and you know They're not gonna happen to go to this panel that gives the information that happened to go to this showing.

802
00:55:16,907 --> 00:55:17,570
Speaker 1: that matches up.

803
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:22,530
Speaker 1: They're gonna walk into the showing, you know, probably in the middle of it and wonder what's going on.

804
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:37,907
Speaker 1: And but if they happen to walk in, you know during the you know Big our block in between two showings where either they're wrapping up the previous showing or discussing the next one Then that's a lot of people are gonna get the proper info and get a whole new appreciation for what they're seeing

805
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:38,950
Speaker 0: now.

806
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:45,608
Speaker 0: Related in a way that I'll explain after we talk about the next idea anime cons need keynote speeches.

807
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:55,568
Speaker 1: I Yeah, I mean you look at opening and closing ceremonies and anime cons and basically they shrink them and shrink them and shrink them Because no one cares and they all suck.

808
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,077
Speaker 1: They mostly suck.

809
00:55:57,137 --> 00:55:58,444
Speaker 0: now part of the problem there.

810
00:55:58,524 --> 00:55:59,670
Speaker 0: Is that most cons?

811
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,467
Speaker 0: Otakon and anime Boston handled is better than a lot of cons and cops accounts.

812
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:08,630
Speaker 0: Okay at it But it takes them a long time to get everyone their badges and people show up late on Friday.

813
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:15,290
Speaker 0: So you have the situation where opening ceremonies can't be near the beginning of the convention because no one has a badge yet.

814
00:56:15,932 --> 00:56:17,298
Speaker 0: Yep, you've had anime cons.

815
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:19,850
Speaker 0: You really have to have the opening ceremonies on Saturday.

816
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:30,722
Speaker 0: But at PAX, you know The keynote speech can basically start the con because one they mail out the badges To the con starts like late on Friday.

817
00:56:30,802 --> 00:56:31,043
Speaker 0: Yep.

818
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:33,150
Speaker 1: It doesn't start early which kind of sucks.

819
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,401
Speaker 1: I wish it would start early because they give you the badge already.

820
00:56:35,722 --> 00:56:36,466
Speaker 1: start it right away.

821
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:36,807
Speaker 1: Come on.

822
00:56:36,847 --> 00:56:39,317
Speaker 1: We're sitting here everyone's here start at the same time.

823
00:56:39,337 --> 00:56:45,540
Speaker 0: it kind of works because everyone shows up late on Friday and the con goes until the End on Sunday and everyone stays to the last minute.

824
00:56:45,661 --> 00:56:58,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, we're not talking about packs we're talking about anime cons, but the real problem with anime conventions is that they They're straying away from anime and I don't mean this in the Daryl Surratt way.

825
00:56:58,391 --> 00:57:01,850
Speaker 1: Well, his his basically his gripe is and I'm sure he won't come.

826
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:09,881
Speaker 1: you know, I'm you know, I've talked about this with him and Gerald and other people enough is that if you call yourself an anime con Be like this is Otacon.

827
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:11,150
Speaker 1: It's an anime convention.

828
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:12,333
Speaker 1: You should.

829
00:57:12,835 --> 00:57:18,050
Speaker 1: why do you have non anime things you called yourself an anime con, you know, it's basically false advertising.

830
00:57:18,332 --> 00:57:19,320
Speaker 1: That's their complaint.

831
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,590
Speaker 1: They like video games.

832
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:33,022
Speaker 1: They like I don't know how much they like Star Wars and such but you know, I'm sure they like some side I'm sure they like some science fiction II things right, you know, they like other geekeries Even though they're primarily into anime and manga.

833
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,854
Speaker 1: it's their complaint is the false advertising situation.

834
00:57:36,395 --> 00:57:42,151
Speaker 1: if a con says this is an anime and gaming con and that has anime and gaming they really have no room to Complain.

835
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:46,225
Speaker 0: I still disagree with them and my reasoning primarily is the RIT anime club.

836
00:57:46,826 --> 00:57:56,630
Speaker 0: the most successful Biggest anime clubs are not clubs that are dedicated Exclusively to the consumption and learning of and learning about anime and nothing else.

837
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:06,681
Speaker 0: They are clubs that collect a whole bunch of people who are related to each other by their mutual like of Anime who do other things together.

838
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:08,630
Speaker 0: they hang out with people who like the same thing.

839
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,828
Speaker 0: They watch anime, but they also have a dodgeball game

840
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:12,852
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

841
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:26,256
Speaker 0: and I think that is the way to go and that's why anime cons have exploded and are so successful And have basically taken over the so-called geek convention circuit and how every other geekery is very focused in its tiny little Usually crappy conventions.

842
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:28,303
Speaker 0: and yet anime conventions are gigantic.

843
00:58:28,363 --> 00:58:28,544
Speaker 1: Yep.

844
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:30,190
Speaker 1: I can say I think and sum that up.

845
00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:31,665
Speaker 1: You know, is that Otakon?

846
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:32,069
Speaker 1: is it?

847
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,719
Speaker 1: You know, I just said it was an anime convention, but is it really?

848
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:40,560
Speaker 1: Otakon is really technically on paper Convention of otaku generation, right?

849
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:53,076
Speaker 1: So and not the bad podcast, but you know Right, so if you think about it, well the convention of otaku generation the people of the otaku generation They like video games.

850
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:56,387
Speaker 1: So the convention for them should have some video games.

851
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:57,170
Speaker 1: It makes sense.

852
00:58:57,812 --> 00:59:03,570
Speaker 0: Also, it's not really false advertising the fact that you both like giant robo and you play some Smash Brothers together.

853
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:07,110
Speaker 0: That's that's what being a member of the anime fan community is all about.

854
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,577
Speaker 0: I think that's the best way to do it.

855
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:14,059
Speaker 0: But when I say straying away from anime I mean the more and more of what goes on.

856
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:17,810
Speaker 0: at most anime conventions is the same thing that we see with the moe.

857
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:37,070
Speaker 0: Well, I don't want to get into all that but that file specter of moe panel summed it up anime conventions are kind of the self-feeding cycle now to where the majority of the content is either reflexive or reflective or Recycled meta fan content as opposed to content about or really related to the anime.

858
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:40,789
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean what was one of the most popular panels at Otakon last year?

859
00:59:41,272 --> 00:59:43,562
Speaker 0: The Phoenix Wright like skit panel.

860
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:44,325
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

861
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:50,150
Speaker 0: and The trouble is that they cons try to combat this by having the very intellectual.

862
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:54,610
Speaker 0: I'm going to talk about Kazuo Koike and why I think he is the genius of our generation.

863
00:59:55,414 --> 00:59:56,621
Speaker 0: No one goes to those panels.

864
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:58,069
Speaker 0: They don't know who Kazuo Koike is.

865
00:59:58,291 --> 01:00:08,330
Speaker 0: yep, but the way to go about this is you've got to mix the two and have the Popular stuff to get people to come to panels and enjoy themselves and really have a good time.

866
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:17,830
Speaker 0: But you've also got to just as a byproduct of everything the con does Point out all the real stuff so that the people who are getting into anime will you know?

867
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,962
Speaker 0: They just go to the giant robot smashing the other giant robot showing anything.

868
01:00:21,002 --> 01:00:22,890
Speaker 0: It's awesome, but they kind of remember.

869
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:25,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, he said what was the guy's name who directed that?

870
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,841
Speaker 0: Hey, where they're showing something else that guy did later We should check that out too.

871
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:32,478
Speaker 0: Yeah Mm-hmm, and that's how I got into anime.

872
01:00:32,558 --> 01:00:42,430
Speaker 0: like really from I went from being just a casual fan to becoming a Self-described fan is because I started to pay attention to all this stuff that all the nerds kept talking about.

873
01:00:43,093 --> 01:00:44,940
Speaker 0: It's more and more anime con stuff.

874
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:50,086
Speaker 0: doesn't talk about the stuff the nerds talk about Or they talk about it in a way only nerds would care about.

875
01:00:50,589 --> 01:01:01,603
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, you definitely if you look at a lot of the the content It's not actually you know it's not even anime manga or video game content.

876
01:01:01,743 --> 01:01:04,390
Speaker 1: It's anime manga video game fan content.

877
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:04,791
Speaker 1: It's like.

878
01:01:04,812 --> 01:01:09,490
Speaker 1: you know you have these fans going to learn about anime video games and manga and such.

879
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:11,157
Speaker 1: But then they're even taking a step out.

880
01:01:11,177 --> 01:01:14,030
Speaker 1: they're going to a panel about themselves for themselves.

881
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:18,369
Speaker 1: And where's the anime and manga and stuff doesn't even really doesn't come into it.

882
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:23,590
Speaker 1: You know and I think really you should just sort of get rid of those things even if they're popular.

883
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:27,911
Speaker 1: Or you know push them to the side or not get rid of them mix them You know.

884
01:01:27,932 --> 01:01:35,282
Speaker 1: so the same panel even if it has some of that meta fan content should also be You know this in this in the same panel should also be good.

885
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:38,435
Speaker 0: so that's the key is you don't get rid of it Because that stuff is great.

886
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:41,068
Speaker 0: I mean I really enjoy all that kind of meta stuff.

887
01:01:41,108 --> 01:01:50,960
Speaker 0: It's fun Yeah, the prop though the way I think to really address it is to make everything a little more highbrow in general across the board and More professional.

888
01:01:51,021 --> 01:02:03,522
Speaker 0: it's still fan run but just kind of up the lowest common denominator a Little bit just a tiny bit and just mention the names of directors and have Showings that have a little bit of value add.

889
01:02:03,743 --> 01:02:05,010
Speaker 0: don't just say it's an anime con.

890
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,436
Speaker 0: We have to have anime showing.

891
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,022
Speaker 0: say it's an anime con.

892
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:14,410
Speaker 0: if we're going to have an anime showing There should be some value add beyond the fact that it happens to be an anime showing.

893
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:20,627
Speaker 0: Mmm if we're gonna have some fan panel there should be some value add other than the fact that it is just a fan panel.

894
01:02:21,048 --> 01:02:24,672
Speaker 0: hmm and With opening ceremonies a lot of cons They're just.

895
01:02:25,073 --> 01:02:31,509
Speaker 0: they're really really really really really really really really lame really lame Oh my but I think Otakon.

896
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:36,085
Speaker 1: I went to an Otakon opening ceremonies and what it pretty much amounted to was the

897
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:36,386
Speaker 0: voice

898
01:02:36,406 --> 01:02:45,656
Speaker 1: of Otakon says Welcome, and then let us show you all our guests and all the guests come out and say hello I'm the guest and hello I'm this parade of guests so you can see them all.

899
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:46,900
Speaker 0: penny arcade Expo.

900
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:53,918
Speaker 0: meanwhile the rock music starts the light starts showing I feel like I am at a rock concert Fucking epic.

901
01:02:54,018 --> 01:03:00,381
Speaker 0: instead of rockers being brought out on stage It is taiko in his goddamn cape and games bald ass shiny head.

902
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:03,830
Speaker 0: that guy oh my god, and the key note.

903
01:03:03,891 --> 01:03:05,170
Speaker 0: I mean a keynote speech.

904
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:06,676
Speaker 0: Why don't anime cons have that?

905
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:10,449
Speaker 0: it doesn't have to be like the voice actor who doesn't speak English or?

906
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,274
Speaker 0: Crispin Freeman or anything like that.

907
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:18,229
Speaker 0: just get someone even tangentially related to the anime industry who can give a good hour-long talk.

908
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:23,397
Speaker 0: That is in some way related to the otaku generation And you know what.

909
01:03:23,477 --> 01:03:26,374
Speaker 0: even if people don't go to it right away The word will spread.

910
01:03:26,414 --> 01:03:33,519
Speaker 0: because the people who go to this thing if you make it professional high quality you have a good speaker He gives a good talk, and you make it.

911
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,390
Speaker 0: you make this idea that is they must go to events.

912
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:40,670
Speaker 0: That will do more than anything to raise the brow of the anime convention.

913
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:52,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you look at like the pack schedule Right the problem with the good at the great thing and the sort of not so great thing about the pack schedule Is basically you look at an anime con schedule right and most people you know?

914
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:57,486
Speaker 1: Vast majority people are going to that masquerade right and the big concert right.

915
01:03:57,506 --> 01:04:01,782
Speaker 1: there's these big Mega events that everyone's going to at PAX.

916
01:04:02,284 --> 01:04:03,890
Speaker 1: It's just mega event after mega event.

917
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:10,190
Speaker 1: It's keynote the game and taiko Q&A right the the red versus blue event.

918
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:19,370
Speaker 1: Yeah the make a strip panel the Second game in taiko Q&A the omega-thon final round the Friday concerts the Saturday concerts.

919
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:22,364
Speaker 1: it's just mega event after mega event.

920
01:04:22,444 --> 01:04:26,100
Speaker 1: boom boom boom and Everyone's going to those motherfuckers.

921
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,304
Speaker 1: You know it now.

922
01:04:27,344 --> 01:04:31,484
Speaker 1: clearly the anime conventions Don't have enough mega events.

923
01:04:31,644 --> 01:04:34,410
Speaker 0: well, but at the same time It's very much masquerade cosplay chess.

924
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,441
Speaker 0: Maybe anime cons are too big to have.

925
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:41,730
Speaker 0: the paradigm of everyone goes to these big events.

926
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:51,279
Speaker 0: And the other problem is and this is the real issue in regards to all this the keynote at PAX worked because There was no line at all to get badges.

927
01:04:51,459 --> 01:04:54,549
Speaker 0: everyone would be in the con immediately when it opened mm-hmm.

928
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:55,235
Speaker 1: Well, why don't we?

929
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:56,329
Speaker 1: why don't we talk about this?

930
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:04,005
Speaker 1: You know we've said for years that anime cons rich every convention should mail out the badges And they gave you know.

931
01:05:04,105 --> 01:05:14,901
Speaker 1: every convention We've ever said this to has always had a very reasonable and understandable response and the response is this number one They're worried about forgery if we mail out these badges to everyone.

932
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:17,190
Speaker 1: people will just copy them and get in for free.

933
01:05:17,952 --> 01:05:22,890
Speaker 1: Number two right it takes a lot of work and a lot of money to mail out the badges.

934
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:33,140
Speaker 1: We'd have to actually spend like a whole weekend or maybe even more time putting all these things in envelopes with the addresses and You know writing all these names on them and this whole thing.

935
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:33,642
Speaker 1: right you know.

936
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:40,968
Speaker 1: and you look at specific situations like say I don't know the Otacon situation right where they have a different badge arts.

937
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:44,206
Speaker 1: that means They'd have to let you choose the badge you want beforehand.

938
01:05:44,226 --> 01:05:46,396
Speaker 1: are they gonna Let you write your own name on it.

939
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:51,699
Speaker 1: You know and the are they just gonna write your name on it for you It's a whole.

940
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,690
Speaker 1: you know some conventions.

941
01:05:52,791 --> 01:06:02,359
Speaker 1: They want to like see your ID to make sure I. otherwise they mail them out You know right and all this sort of stuff that goes on and you know this There's a lot of you know.

942
01:06:02,379 --> 01:06:07,590
Speaker 1: they could hire a company to take care of it But it costs a lot of money and all those things are pretty understandable.

943
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:13,268
Speaker 1: But despite those things I say there's no excuse not to mail out the badges.

944
01:06:13,729 --> 01:06:21,730
Speaker 0: well One thing I can say is that we got a series of fantastic emails from actually Jackie Who is the director of registration for anime Boston?

945
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:30,101
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and she talked in great detail about the the rationale for why anime Boston does not mail them out and all the things they Do and I don't want to.

946
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:41,347
Speaker 1: we should do a separate show One of those situations where someone makes a whole bunch of points and all those points are true and correct But yet, I still think they should do it anyway.

947
01:06:41,609 --> 01:07:03,483
Speaker 0: well I don't want to read her emails on the air just because we've already gone on forever on this topic but we'll do a separate show because She made a lot of great points, and I think I agree with absolutely everything she said mm-hmm and That is the real core problem with anime conventions And it's actually a multifaceted and very difficult to solve problem.

948
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,248
Speaker 0: and to summarize as best.

949
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:14,680
Speaker 0: I can the demographic of an anime convention as opposed to say packs no packs was Late 20-something affluent gamer guys.

950
01:07:15,061 --> 01:07:19,233
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean you know there was some early 20-somethings in some high schools But it was girls.

951
01:07:19,294 --> 01:07:21,341
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was yeah a lot of girls at packs.

952
01:07:21,402 --> 01:07:32,070
Speaker 0: actually I would say it was about 55 45 Yeah, but you know packs skewed older than Otakon not just older But also just a much more affluent.

953
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,879
Speaker 0: I mean people had money at packs.

954
01:07:35,059 --> 01:07:35,280
Speaker 0: well

955
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:39,313
Speaker 1: and also the people at packs just were more mature

956
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:39,635
Speaker 0: in

957
01:07:39,815 --> 01:07:40,559
Speaker 1: their acting,

958
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:56,879
Speaker 0: but the the demographic skew of Anime conventions like Otakon, Katsu-Kon, Anime Boston tends to be Teenagers often on the younger end of the scale often under 18 Who have not traveled on their own Much if at all in their lives.

959
01:07:57,402 --> 01:08:06,240
Speaker 0: for many people going to anime conventions I've confirmed this by talking to a lot of people at anime conventions It is their first major trip anywhere without their parents.

960
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:14,310
Speaker 0: wow or their parents took them and left them at the hotel that their parents Got for them, and then went off on their own vacation, and they don't have a lot of money.

961
01:08:14,892 --> 01:08:17,921
Speaker 0: They're often very poor usually because they're in high school.

962
01:08:17,962 --> 01:08:28,970
Speaker 0: I didn't have any money in high school as I get it down Yep, and all of these factors combined Cause so many like strange problems that you wouldn't even think about.

963
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:32,180
Speaker 1: It's almost like you can't operate as a convention.

964
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,792
Speaker 1: you have to operate as like a freaking summer camp because all these you know Punk kids.

965
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:45,602
Speaker 0: I mean like one example that really comes up a lot is that These kids don't know how to get hotel rooms And I remember it was at an Otakon a few years ago.

966
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,048
Speaker 1: You call up a hotel on the telephone.

967
01:08:47,068 --> 01:08:52,930
Speaker 0: you say I would like A room, please let's not get into that, but someone asked seriously at a con feedback session.

968
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:53,819
Speaker 0: I think it was an Otakon.

969
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,629
Speaker 0: it might have been Katsu-Kan.

970
01:08:55,113 --> 01:09:09,674
Speaker 0: They basically said that their hotel had ripped them off And they wanted the con to fix it because the hotel said one right, but when they checked out they charged him something else and All indications were that this hotel had charged them Taxes

971
01:09:10,075 --> 01:09:11,279
Speaker 1: which is what hotels do

972
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,046
Speaker 0: and they did not realize this.

973
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:19,189
Speaker 1: and also There's also the other problem on top of that which is what does the convention have to do with your hotel room?

974
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:21,720
Speaker 1: Convention has nothing to do with your hotel.

975
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:22,729
Speaker 1: Why are you asking them?

976
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:27,349
Speaker 1: But it also just that's like going to complain to my work about my rent.

977
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:35,808
Speaker 0: Conventions like Otakon and anime all these anime conventions have to cater to a lot of needs that they really shouldn't have to like.

978
01:09:35,828 --> 01:09:41,550
Speaker 0: the The policy of most anime conventions in regards to a lost badge or a you know forgot my registration.

979
01:09:42,133 --> 01:09:44,765
Speaker 0: I show up at the con and I don't you have like an ID.

980
01:09:44,785 --> 01:09:53,437
Speaker 0: any of that stuff is to accommodate the person in any possible way and most conventions will like give you a new badge or have some sort of policy for that.

981
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:56,158
Speaker 1: but Some of them say no badge tough shit.

982
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:57,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, but many don't.

983
01:09:57,844 --> 01:09:59,670
Speaker 1: but it's not just the badges though.

984
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:03,446
Speaker 1: There are many situations in which that is a fan-run convention.

985
01:10:03,486 --> 01:10:04,310
Speaker 1: They really care.

986
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:12,266
Speaker 1: They're really trying to be as accommodating as helpful and as nice as they possibly can be and they are and they succeed in the Sun to be said for that.

987
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:15,503
Speaker 1: But perhaps they shouldn't be now.

988
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:18,521
Speaker 0: I mean look at a professional event.

989
01:10:18,762 --> 01:10:20,430
Speaker 0: if I lose my badge fuck you.

990
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you lose your badge, then you're a comic-con.

991
01:10:22,637 --> 01:10:23,460
Speaker 1: There's gonna be like.

992
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:26,389
Speaker 1: so it's like losing your ticket to a baseball game.

993
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,563
Speaker 0: No, well, they did you look at their policy?

994
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:29,207
Speaker 0: I don't know.

995
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:29,609
Speaker 0: You don't know.

996
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:32,153
Speaker 1: I know if you lose your ticket to a baseball game You're fucked.

997
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:35,530
Speaker 0: that even the read cons are a lot more accommodating than you would think.

998
01:10:35,696 --> 01:10:41,410
Speaker 0: Yeah But like one of the biggest concerns of mailing badges out that is perfectly legitimate is that these people will lose their badges.

999
01:10:41,611 --> 01:10:42,092
Speaker 0: And you know what?

1000
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:45,745
Speaker 0: I hate to say it but the demographic of anime conventions.

1001
01:10:46,307 --> 01:10:47,110
Speaker 0: This is a concern.

1002
01:10:47,151 --> 01:10:48,470
Speaker 0: I mean packs, it's not a concern.

1003
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:52,977
Speaker 0: They had a line for people who like lost their badge or had problems or whatever There was.

1004
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:57,010
Speaker 0: there were like two people in that line Like there's just no one had problems.

1005
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:03,650
Speaker 0: You know tens of thousands of people have their badges mailed to them with no incidents that caused a problem whatsoever.

1006
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:07,862
Speaker 1: None that were noticed in any way or had any visible effect for anyone else.

1007
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:13,649
Speaker 0: and the anime convention people who run this stuff point legitimately that if we mail out the badges there will be crazy problems.

1008
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,597
Speaker 0: and I do not say that no you are wrong.

1009
01:11:16,617 --> 01:11:17,219
Speaker 0: Look at packs.

1010
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:19,085
Speaker 0: I say you are right.

1011
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:20,710
Speaker 0: You will have these problems.

1012
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:22,402
Speaker 0: I mean anime conventions.

1013
01:11:22,442 --> 01:11:28,406
Speaker 0: if they mail the badges out I would wager that a full 10% of people are gonna show up without their badge and you just.

1014
01:11:28,647 --> 01:11:30,890
Speaker 1: I think that they should do That and they should just say tough shit.

1015
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:44,112
Speaker 1: I think that's what they have to do because I think even though in the short term you would have a lot of upset people And all these punk kids I think that a it'll be a good lesson for those punk kids and they will be better for it and be the convention will Be better for it.

1016
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:47,783
Speaker 1: And even though it's it's a short-term suffering for a long-term gain.

1017
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,010
Speaker 0: I don't even think necessarily full tough shit.

1018
01:11:50,091 --> 01:11:56,822
Speaker 0: I think you can ease into it because the real Concern just needs some toughness any toughness to be better than no toughness.

1019
01:11:56,842 --> 01:12:05,396
Speaker 0: conventions have gotten more and more Accommodating and as a result people who go to conventions are more and more Expecting all of this kind of extra.

1020
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:12,564
Speaker 1: this is yeah, it's a problem whenever you're too nice, right people sort of you know The the standard of what is you know acceptable.

1021
01:12:12,604 --> 01:12:16,999
Speaker 1: you're raising the bar And so basically this sort of like this, you know level of okay.

1022
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,650
Speaker 1: This is satisfactory and we are going so far above and beyond.

1023
01:12:20,813 --> 01:12:21,648
Speaker 1: Right, we're so great.

1024
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:28,950
Speaker 1: But if you're so great every time then eventually the bar of satisfactory is raised up into what should just be great.

1025
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:34,099
Speaker 1: So now if you become a little less great than you were before Suddenly everyone thinks you're being bad.

1026
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,410
Speaker 1: But really you're still ten times better than everyone else.

1027
01:12:37,112 --> 01:12:39,040
Speaker 1: You know you were just being extra nice before.

1028
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,710
Speaker 1: you're being unnecessarily nice and people took it for granted.

1029
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:49,388
Speaker 1: And you can't you know, you got to make sure that people don't take your extra extra extra awesomeness for granted Because that'll bite you.

1030
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:50,153
Speaker 0: I'm not I don't.

1031
01:12:50,193 --> 01:12:56,401
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna want to get into all the specific suggestions because obviously a Plan to do something about this problem is.

1032
01:12:56,742 --> 01:12:58,630
Speaker 0: it has to be more than tough shit.

1033
01:12:58,932 --> 01:13:00,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we don't have time to talk about details.

1034
01:13:00,971 --> 01:13:03,449
Speaker 1: But do you want to talk about the one the one big thing?

1035
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:10,045
Speaker 0: Well, we'll get to that because the other concern, you know One more idea that comes up from the demographics is that people have no money.

1036
01:13:10,507 --> 01:13:17,256
Speaker 0: So as a result The volunteering situation is the opposite for things like packs.

1037
01:13:17,737 --> 01:13:30,770
Speaker 0: at packs and cons like it the people who run the convention are either professionals or Despite the fact that packs is a for-profit con They're still all volunteers like all those enforcers are the equivalent of gophers that anime cons.

1038
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:43,579
Speaker 0: But rather than having people at the convention advertising things like punk kid no money Volunteer for 20 hours doing the grunt work and we'll give you a place to stay with like eight other punk kids and a free badge.

1039
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:49,950
Speaker 0: Instead packs has a waiting list to be considered to be a volunteer for the next pack.

1040
01:13:50,015 --> 01:13:53,599
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean why are anime cons begging for enforcers?

1041
01:13:53,739 --> 01:13:59,978
Speaker 1: Otakon has more attendees than packs by a lot because packs counts Turnstyle and Otakon counts badges.

1042
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:02,890
Speaker 1: Yep packs Otakon is a ton more people.

1043
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:08,122
Speaker 1: Why does packs have people lining up and on a waiting list to be a volunteer.

1044
01:14:08,383 --> 01:14:11,550
Speaker 1: and why does Otakon beg people to volunteer?

1045
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,355
Speaker 1: What is wrong with this picture?

1046
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,299
Speaker 0: and not just Otakon?

1047
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:22,130
Speaker 0: every anime convention the first time I ever staffed a con I was at an early Katsucon and I was drunk and I was walking along with Scott Johnson.

1048
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:27,370
Speaker 0: We were both drunk and the staffer comes up and there's like you two have just been nominated to be blah blah blah.

1049
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:33,945
Speaker 0: She handed us staff badges and said if you guys just mod Take care of this hallway and keep people from sitting on the floor for an hour.

1050
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:48,790
Speaker 0: You've got staff badges No, and we were like, okay Thanks But that and there are so many reasons for this because the people who go to cons like packs are people like us for the most part or who you know.

1051
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:54,070
Speaker 0: We go to Otakon for all these years and just showing up as an attendee in and of itself doesn't do a lot for us.

1052
01:14:54,531 --> 01:15:01,450
Speaker 0: But being volunteers being staff helping out doing panels that is so much fun that that's why we'll do it for free forever.

1053
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:01,895
Speaker 0: We love it.

1054
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,585
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but It's hard to get people who?

1055
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:13,709
Speaker 0: Want to volunteer and can afford to take time off work and just go to this convention with very little compensation and do it.

1056
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:15,775
Speaker 0: But yet I kind of like packs.

1057
01:15:15,855 --> 01:15:19,385
Speaker 0: everyone can afford to go anyway, and they actually enjoy volunteering.

1058
01:15:19,445 --> 01:15:21,290
Speaker 0: So it's basically it's a solved problem.

1059
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:28,730
Speaker 1: Well, I think one major aspect, you know of the thing is that you know at the anime convention, right?

1060
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:32,450
Speaker 1: You got a look at the motivating factor for volunteering, right?

1061
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:39,558
Speaker 1: It's like you ever hear the story about how you know, they go to the lawyers and they say lawyers These old people really need some legal help.

1062
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:42,508
Speaker 1: Will you help them for a discounted rate and all the lawyers go?

1063
01:15:42,568 --> 01:15:49,679
Speaker 1: No No, no, but they go to the same lawyers and they say oh Lawyers these old people really need your help.

1064
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:50,682
Speaker 1: Will you help them for free?

1065
01:15:51,144 --> 01:15:51,605
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

1066
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:53,130
Speaker 1: We'd love to help them for free.

1067
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,395
Speaker 1: Yes, of course.

1068
01:15:54,475 --> 01:15:58,390
Speaker 1: We're so giving in charitable right and it's a psychological thing.

1069
01:15:58,451 --> 01:16:06,834
Speaker 1: That's pretty well understood Relatively as any psychological thing can be understood in that when you enter the money into the equation There's different.

1070
01:16:06,954 --> 01:16:10,750
Speaker 1: you think with a different part of your brain that makes a financial calculation.

1071
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:14,289
Speaker 1: But by not mentioning the money just saying will you help them out for free?

1072
01:16:14,772 --> 01:16:20,516
Speaker 1: You know the sort of charity goodwill part of the brain comes into action Which is separate and so you'll do it.

1073
01:16:21,178 --> 01:16:30,570
Speaker 1: the incentive to volunteer at an anime convention Right the fat by fans for fans anime convention, right is free badge.

1074
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:34,222
Speaker 1: So the money part of your brain is coming into it and you're think you're.

1075
01:16:34,242 --> 01:16:36,570
Speaker 1: what you really want is to enjoy the con.

1076
01:16:36,973 --> 01:16:38,224
Speaker 1: So you're going to right?

1077
01:16:39,971 --> 01:16:49,804
Speaker 1: Do the minimal amount of work you can to get that freaking badge because you just want to run off and enjoy the con Right at the professional con where everyone there is a hired hand.

1078
01:16:49,864 --> 01:16:51,530
Speaker 1: No volunteers really, right?

1079
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,544
Speaker 1: You're making the same money calculation, but you're saying man.

1080
01:16:54,624 --> 01:16:55,610
Speaker 1: I ain't getting paid.

1081
01:16:55,711 --> 01:17:00,176
Speaker 1: This is my job and they do work because it's their job and they do it Just like you do your job.

1082
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:06,490
Speaker 1: if you have a job, right at PAX They don't call you a gopher or a volunteer.

1083
01:17:06,931 --> 01:17:08,497
Speaker 1: They call you an enforcer.

1084
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,346
Speaker 1: and if you think that doesn't have a psychological difference you are.

1085
01:17:11,366 --> 01:17:12,390
Speaker 1: I don't know what you're thinking.

1086
01:17:12,872 --> 01:17:14,099
Speaker 1: They call you an enforcer.

1087
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:20,650
Speaker 1: It's a position of respect and People look up to you and you know, you feel that you're important.

1088
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:25,565
Speaker 1: You feel you have a duty to something you actually actively care about a great deal.

1089
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:27,310
Speaker 1: You want to do a good job.

1090
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,052
Speaker 1: You are there.

1091
01:17:28,414 --> 01:17:31,865
Speaker 1: not thinking about money not thinking about trying to get a free badge.

1092
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:32,748
Speaker 1: You're thinking about.

1093
01:17:32,908 --> 01:17:34,514
Speaker 1: I'm here I want to do this.

1094
01:17:34,674 --> 01:17:35,437
Speaker 1: I'm an enforcer.

1095
01:17:35,457 --> 01:17:36,741
Speaker 1: You're taking it seriously.

1096
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:45,630
Speaker 1: You are respected and thanked and You know, you are grateful just even to be able to be an enforcer and you do the best possible job.

1097
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:47,910
Speaker 1: You can know what is you want what this does?

1098
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:51,524
Speaker 0: And the one of the same famous people work on an open-source software.

1099
01:17:51,544 --> 01:17:52,850
Speaker 1: the same mentality is enforcer.

1100
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:56,924
Speaker 0: But one of the biggest problems comms have anime comes even when they get volunteers.

1101
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:58,209
Speaker 0: the volunteers don't know crap.

1102
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:00,522
Speaker 0: I mean 90% of anime conventions.

1103
01:18:00,562 --> 01:18:08,390
Speaker 0: if you ask an average staffer Any question they will not have the answer yet that you need to find the specialized staffer for your question.

1104
01:18:08,732 --> 01:18:09,616
Speaker 0: I mean even the cons.

1105
01:18:09,657 --> 01:18:12,170
Speaker 0: we like I'll find a staff and we're like, hey, where's the video room?

1106
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:16,550
Speaker 0: They don't know they just kind of like and they just gotta wait for me to go away.

1107
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:18,978
Speaker 0: And this is at every anime convention.

1108
01:18:18,999 --> 01:18:22,230
Speaker 0: I I make a point of asking unless you go to the information booth.

1109
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:26,750
Speaker 0: They know everything well at some cons and the cons info booth is pretty badass.

1110
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:30,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, Katsu cons was not so much two years ago anime Boston's was good.

1111
01:18:30,666 --> 01:18:35,725
Speaker 0: anime Boston's was good All right, but the stat the first staffer we met had no idea where anything was.

1112
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:43,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, they couldn't answer our question but with the enforcer mentality You don't have to worry about training these people, you know.

1113
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:50,768
Speaker 0: The anime con staffers always point out that it's basically impossible to train these kids Especially with the limited resources and the short amount of time.

1114
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:55,490
Speaker 0: Pax enforcers or people treated that way like the video katsu staff.

1115
01:18:56,217 --> 01:18:57,349
Speaker 0: They learn it on their own.

1116
01:18:57,591 --> 01:19:00,501
Speaker 0: They care and they make sure that they can answer all these questions.

1117
01:19:00,842 --> 01:19:03,010
Speaker 0: because they're so dedicated to the con.

1118
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,736
Speaker 0: They care so they learn.

1119
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:06,864
Speaker 0: you don't have to spend any resources teaching them.

1120
01:19:06,904 --> 01:19:07,667
Speaker 0: They already know.

1121
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:13,770
Speaker 1: Yep Everyone who's in you know, and it's like you look at other cons, right and it's not just the naming of it, right?

1122
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,500
Speaker 1: You look at say Otacon, right?

1123
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,706
Speaker 1: They've got gopher.

1124
01:19:17,746 --> 01:19:24,013
Speaker 1: They got you know Committed totally committed gopher the volunteer staff Uberstaff.

1125
01:19:24,053 --> 01:19:32,630
Speaker 0: right this stupid hierarchical system where if you want to be a staffer I asked several conventions way back Before we even did geek nights like hey, I have a ton of experience.

1126
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,403
Speaker 0: I was the president of the biggest anime club in the country for a while.

1127
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:36,990
Speaker 0: I got all my shit together.

1128
01:19:37,351 --> 01:19:39,740
Speaker 0: I have experienced staffing conventions other conventions.

1129
01:19:40,362 --> 01:19:42,430
Speaker 0: Here's my gigantic resume of related stuff.

1130
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:53,384
Speaker 0: I would love to join the staff and help you out and the answer was universally Well, you can be a gopher to start and then if you're good at that You can work your way up the ladder to which I said, you know what?

1131
01:19:53,404 --> 01:19:56,695
Speaker 0: No at PAX Everyone's an enforcer.

1132
01:19:57,157 --> 01:19:57,840
Speaker 1: end of story.

1133
01:19:58,202 --> 01:19:59,890
Speaker 1: different enforcers have different jobs.

1134
01:20:00,192 --> 01:20:04,699
Speaker 1: You know one guy might be in charge of a panel room here One guy might be in charge of all the panel rooms.

1135
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:07,230
Speaker 1: one guy might be in charge of a video game room, right?

1136
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:13,614
Speaker 1: So obviously some people have responsibilities that are larger than others, but everyone is just Enforcer.

1137
01:20:13,835 --> 01:20:24,438
Speaker 1: you are an enforcer equal to the other enforcers And you know, so no one has like a higher authority or a lower authority except I guess, you know The you know, Robert Coo or whoever right?

1138
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:27,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, and I guess you might have a report enforcer.

1139
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,403
Speaker 1: You report to and such but you're not.

1140
01:20:30,644 --> 01:20:35,121
Speaker 1: there's no ranking There's none of this psychological difference in respect or any.

1141
01:20:35,482 --> 01:20:37,650
Speaker 1: you know any, you know duty or anything like that.

1142
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:40,082
Speaker 1: It's an enforcer is an enforcer is enforcer.

1143
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:41,549
Speaker 1: You are the real deal.

1144
01:20:41,891 --> 01:20:58,570
Speaker 0: Well part of this like hierarchy that emerges in a lot of anime conventions Especially the smaller ones is that the the high-level staff tend to be a very close-knit clique of people and They seem to not want to let other people eventually replace them or join this inner circle.

1145
01:20:58,732 --> 01:20:59,949
Speaker 0: Yes, that's exactly what it is.

1146
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:18,927
Speaker 0: This isn't really as much of a problem with a lot of the bigger cons, but I've seen many unnamed anime conventions where they basically Force new people to do the crap jobs Even if they could be doing much more better work for the con Solely because they want to hold on to their little bit of extra special staff

1147
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:19,449
Speaker 1: power.

1148
01:21:19,629 --> 01:21:21,174
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean that's another thing right?

1149
01:21:21,214 --> 01:21:21,274
Speaker 1: is?

1150
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:29,578
Speaker 1: you look at the the animatic anime con with the hierarchical arrangement right power structure and There's a community of the people at the top there.

1151
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:33,150
Speaker 1: They're possibly hopefully tighten it and all together, right?

1152
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:44,170
Speaker 1: But all the gophers and stuff Rogers these individual laborers basically at PAX all of the enforcers All of them are all in this one community together.

1153
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:47,210
Speaker 1: They're all with each other on this one giant team.

1154
01:21:47,451 --> 01:21:54,830
Speaker 1: Everyone is heavily involved in you know in communication in the forums on the newsletter talking to everyone else.

1155
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:59,985
Speaker 1: You know, it's not just a few people at the top sending the orders down from on high.

1156
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:07,850
Speaker 1: It's a big community and You know, you really need the big staff community not the little staff community that you know.

1157
01:22:08,332 --> 01:22:11,283
Speaker 1: Just Lord that rules over, you know the minions.

1158
01:22:11,524 --> 01:22:16,645
Speaker 0: now you might be saying but rim and Scott Didn't you just say the demographics are mutually exclusive and there's no way to do this.

1159
01:22:16,946 --> 01:22:17,810
Speaker 0: Why are you even talking?

1160
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:20,578
Speaker 0: Here's how I think we can pull this off pretty readily.

1161
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:22,225
Speaker 0: one obviously change the name of it.

1162
01:22:22,326 --> 01:22:24,333
Speaker 0: Maybe not enforcer That's obviously taken.

1163
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:33,128
Speaker 0: but you know get rid of this whole the current volunteer system and replace it with a more flat structure and Do all the psychological stuff.

1164
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,837
Speaker 1: I mean you can even get the name staff.

1165
01:22:34,857 --> 01:22:37,610
Speaker 1: people like that staff is a gives people a really good feeling.

1166
01:22:38,752 --> 01:22:46,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is a lot of hope because just in this last year I've seen this gigantic reversal in the demographics.

1167
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:53,689
Speaker 0: I think this year for the first time in like six years the average age of anime con goers is going to go up.

1168
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:56,943
Speaker 1: Well, I think because anime is not on television.

1169
01:22:57,163 --> 01:22:58,630
Speaker 1: You're not getting the new fans.

1170
01:22:59,152 --> 01:23:03,730
Speaker 1: So the only people still coming are the people who are fans, you know, the Naruto people, right?

1171
01:23:03,971 --> 01:23:06,598
Speaker 1: The Naruto people are getting older.

1172
01:23:06,739 --> 01:23:10,108
Speaker 1: so the only you know, it's them still coming and still coming.

1173
01:23:10,148 --> 01:23:16,290
Speaker 0: but think about it You know coming say one year you have a hundred new people who come to Otakon because they watch Dragon Ball Z on TV.

1174
01:23:17,032 --> 01:23:20,746
Speaker 0: The next year 90 of those come back because they remembered they had a good time.

1175
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:25,778
Speaker 0: the next year 60 of them come back but now they've moved on to all this other anime.

1176
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:32,669
Speaker 0: and the next year 40 come back and those 40 will come back for the Rest of their lives and they're the ones who know the names of directors at this point.

1177
01:23:32,931 --> 01:23:38,390
Speaker 0: Yep, but so anime had this gigantic surge in popularity in the US.

1178
01:23:38,691 --> 01:23:41,002
Speaker 0: So every year I mean Otakon like.

1179
01:23:41,404 --> 01:23:51,917
Speaker 0: the growth of Otakon was crazy to the point that the fact that Otakon dealt with, you know, these 8,000 person per year leaps is Amazing to me like I still cannot.

1180
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:56,693
Speaker 0: it is so cool that Otakon was able to handle that without missing a beat Mm-hmm.

1181
01:23:56,974 --> 01:23:57,697
Speaker 0: I mean even a con.

1182
01:23:57,798 --> 01:24:00,710
Speaker 0: I I might have been running probably would have collapsed under that load.

1183
01:24:01,575 --> 01:24:02,561
Speaker 1: It's a big load it is.

1184
01:24:02,983 --> 01:24:11,780
Speaker 0: but now anime the surge kind of died and the growth is dropping off and we're starting to see the shift go back toward the.

1185
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:21,150
Speaker 0: The self-described anime fans come back and there aren't as many newer fans and I think in a couple more years Anime cons are going to be at this steady state again.

1186
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:26,790
Speaker 0: I think Otakon will probably cap out around 30,000 ish people, but I think the age is going to go up.

1187
01:24:27,193 --> 01:24:36,680
Speaker 0: I think the income is going to go up and I think They will be able to get away with being much more selective in their staffing, but at the same time We'll be able to get more total staffers.

1188
01:24:37,222 --> 01:24:39,290
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and better staffers.

1189
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,010
Speaker 1: You still have to one good staffers worth five crappy one.

1190
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:44,130
Speaker 0: You still have to do all of the psychological stuff.

1191
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,397
Speaker 0: You still have to get rid of the.

1192
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:47,670
Speaker 0: you know, grab gophers at the con mentality.

1193
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:51,573
Speaker 0: You have to make people apply to be a staffer Mm-hmm.

1194
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:52,936
Speaker 1: I think another.

1195
01:24:53,157 --> 01:24:54,179
Speaker 1: another problem though.

1196
01:24:54,259 --> 01:25:01,546
Speaker 1: Is that you the sort of unique to PAX is that you know PAX has this penny arcade community and then it is a convention.

1197
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:05,842
Speaker 1: on top of that These other conventions Otakana anime Boston etc.

1198
01:25:05,882 --> 01:25:06,284
Speaker 1: Right are.

1199
01:25:06,304 --> 01:25:08,170
Speaker 1: just all they are is a convention.

1200
01:25:08,372 --> 01:25:10,609
Speaker 1: They aren't on top of an existing thing.

1201
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:23,226
Speaker 1: well So I think what they really need to do a lot of work on right is they need to do a lot of work in building the community Outside of the rest of the year when the convention isn't going on.

1202
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:25,498
Speaker 0: now a lot of them try I mean try but they don't try.

1203
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,570
Speaker 0: all these cons have the active forum communities.

1204
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:28,072
Speaker 0: They do.

1205
01:25:28,253 --> 01:25:36,570
Speaker 0: the forum community of every con we've ever been to is not in any way Representative of the people who show up to the con at all.

1206
01:25:37,114 --> 01:25:39,350
Speaker 1: And I think you know, all these conventions are friendly with each other.

1207
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,789
Speaker 1: They all have boobs at each other's conventions and such and such and such, right?

1208
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:52,650
Speaker 1: I think they would do well to not not partner up actually in a business sense because you don't want to like You know have Otakon suffer because some you know other conventions.

1209
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was basically any con Otakon joined with would just like.

1210
01:25:56,386 --> 01:26:04,487
Speaker 1: but they should create one Anime convention community place one that is sanctioned internet, but it's the official one.

1211
01:26:04,547 --> 01:26:10,132
Speaker 1: for maybe even You know get the anime news network in on there, you know, and that should be you know The place.

1212
01:26:10,173 --> 01:26:14,470
Speaker 1: that sort of holds everything together and then off of that is what you know.

1213
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:20,489
Speaker 1: You can create the same sort of arrangement where there is the community which spawns the conventions out from it.

1214
01:26:21,372 --> 01:26:26,751
Speaker 0: Now, I don't know which cons will do or try to do or tell us why we can't do any of the things we just talked About.

1215
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:36,745
Speaker 0: but one thing I can say in regards of the showing rooms any con that pays for our hotel and travel We've got enough of our own staff to run that for you.

1216
01:26:37,368 --> 01:26:41,882
Speaker 1: Yes Anything that we have suggested if you say can't be done.

1217
01:26:41,942 --> 01:26:43,046
Speaker 1: Well, we will do it.

1218
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:43,929
Speaker 1: We are the put-up.

1219
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:49,510
Speaker 1: So don't come and tell us why it can't be done because we will do it and then you're in trouble.

1220
01:26:49,711 --> 01:26:52,830
Speaker 0: And if you don't believe us seriously ask Katsu Con or Kinetic Con.

1221
01:26:53,212 --> 01:26:57,229
Speaker 0: We we have put up anything that any con has ever challenged us to do.

1222
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:01,585
Speaker 0: Not counting crazy conventions do two panels at once.

1223
01:27:01,626 --> 01:27:02,027
Speaker 1: Sorry.

1224
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:02,610
Speaker 1: That's not gonna.

1225
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:14,189
Speaker 0: yeah, well, I'm not going to name the con but there is a con that every year asks us to come and Basically will not accommodate anything we need and simultaneously will make ludicrous demands of us.

1226
01:27:15,511 --> 01:27:16,514
Speaker 0: We don't go as a result.

1227
01:27:16,694 --> 01:27:18,881
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like Otakon we can.

1228
01:27:19,021 --> 01:27:22,712
Speaker 0: we can bring enough staff to personally do most of the stuff We talked about.

1229
01:27:22,732 --> 01:27:24,899
Speaker 0: yep, like you won't even need any people.

1230
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,833
Speaker 0: just give us the authority and we've got like 20 staff We can bring.

1231
01:27:28,853 --> 01:27:30,079
Speaker 0: they'll be ready to go.

1232
01:27:30,099 --> 01:27:32,550
Speaker 0: We'll have everything ready like six months before the con.

1233
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:34,937
Speaker 0: You think we're done.

1234
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,305
Speaker 0: we've gone on way too long here.

1235
01:27:36,325 --> 01:27:38,256
Speaker 1: All right It was a lot to say about.

1236
01:27:38,276 --> 01:27:43,642
Speaker 0: there was a lot to say and I still have more to say but We'll do a separate show about the mailing out.

1237
01:27:43,682 --> 01:27:45,450
Speaker 1: bad yet another show.

1238
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:56,107
Speaker 0: Well, no, I want to get some of these staffers who have emailed me and have an actual discussion with them on the air Shit later way later after con season because good God we have a lot to do.
