1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,579
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, October 28th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:15,024
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:17,515
Speaker 1: We are reviewing the 2021 movie Dune.

4
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:21,207
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:24,378
Speaker 1: so, uh Biking home from work today.

6
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:25,545
Speaker 1: Like I do want a city bike.

7
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,654
Speaker 1: I Had two things happen.

8
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:28,978
Speaker 1: They're both minor.

9
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:30,563
Speaker 1: They were just notable.

10
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:32,308
Speaker 1: One of them's funny and one of them was just weird.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,970
Speaker 1: So It's hard to get a city bikes lately, like they're just like people are biking like crazy, especially in Midtown.

12
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:39,490
Speaker 0: So let's get a little colder.

13
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:47,382
Speaker 0: So and the thing is the the city bike usage does go down when it gets colder But not as much as you'd expect not as much as you would think.

14
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,996
Speaker 0: people keep going even in the cold Right, and it's not that it's.

15
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:54,610
Speaker 0: I mean, it's cold right now if you ask me, but it's not that cold, right?

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,212
Speaker 0: It's not like.

17
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:55,574
Speaker 0: yeah, like.

18
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,030
Speaker 1: I just bike home in like a dress shirt and a blazer and I was fine.

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,848
Speaker 0: It's it's below 60 Fahrenheit, so I'm cold, but it's like I could bike if I was outside.

20
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:05,570
Speaker 0: I could use city bike.

21
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:13,062
Speaker 1: So I'm at a dock where there's only one bike like left and I'm just walking toward it And I I stand next to it and I pull my keys.

22
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:20,730
Speaker 1: someone runs up and grabs it before you know I'm about to put my keys in and this dude from behind me just says that's my fucking bike and I turn around.

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,733
Speaker 1: He's ready to fight me.

24
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:23,499
Speaker 1: So I was just like what.

25
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,322
Speaker 1: I just walked away.

26
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,590
Speaker 1: dude was like willing to do violence.

27
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:29,922
Speaker 1: All right, well you can have it bro for his city bike.

28
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,809
Speaker 1: so I just walked away and let him do his thing.

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,339
Speaker 1: Weird dangerous looking dude who seemed to have problems.

30
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:38,250
Speaker 1: So whatever I walk like a block over to another doc.

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,716
Speaker 1: There's plenty of bikes and I'm fine.

32
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:42,728
Speaker 1: So I'm biking home and I'm on what?

33
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:48,887
Speaker 1: in Midtown There's a lot of like cross streets with a narrow bike path like a one-way really narrow bike path.

34
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:56,090
Speaker 1: and as I'm biking There's two women running in the bike path side by side completely blocking it and there's a baller that a lot.

35
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:00,250
Speaker 1: It's fine bollard on the left sidewalk on the right with a big curb and like ours and stuff.

36
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,777
Speaker 1: So I come up behind him.

37
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:02,320
Speaker 1: It's a city bike.

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,164
Speaker 1: I'm going real slow.

39
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:04,631
Speaker 1: So I'm like, excuse me, pardon me Like.

40
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,254
Speaker 1: I'm trying to be nice.

41
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:06,379
Speaker 1: They don't respond at all.

42
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,509
Speaker 0: So they got headphones in or something?

43
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:08,911
Speaker 1: I don't know.

44
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:17,319
Speaker 1: So I ding the city bike little bell once like dick and immediately a Laurel and Hardy routine ensues.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,650
Speaker 1: the woman on the left like immediately just likes pan.

46
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,498
Speaker 1: It like startles and turns to the right.

47
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,410
Speaker 1: the woman on the right panics and turns to the left.

48
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:33,670
Speaker 1: They bounce foreheads against each other and fall over in a tangle Like I stop and I'm like, are you okay?

49
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,183
Speaker 1: And neither one of them would talk to me and they were just.

50
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:40,522
Speaker 1: they were unhappy With the situation and I decided just let them be.

51
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:43,956
Speaker 1: they did not want assistance of any kind But I had to wait.

52
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:47,129
Speaker 1: but I had to actually wait for them to get out of the way so I could bike past them.

53
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,902
Speaker 1: So I'm just standing there like pardon me.

54
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:50,846
Speaker 1: Just trying to get by.

55
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:51,730
Speaker 0: I find the problem.

56
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,111
Speaker 0: You know the.

57
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:56,890
Speaker 0: the culprit there really is simply that you know, the sidewalks are too narrow.

58
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:57,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

59
00:02:57,914 --> 00:03:03,535
Speaker 1: I will never run in bike lanes, but I see a lot of people running in them and I understand I don't agree, right?

60
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:04,518
Speaker 0: It's not their fault.

61
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:05,702
Speaker 0: It's like they want to run.

62
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:07,750
Speaker 0: Okay, the sidewalk is too narrow.

63
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,402
Speaker 0: They should take away a lane from cars to make the sidewalk wider.

64
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:17,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then on top of that It's like there's just not like, you know green space in that, you know, you I notice a lot more.

65
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:21,370
Speaker 0: if you see that happening It's probably because that area doesn't have like a park.

66
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,910
Speaker 0: You don't see people running in the bike lane at a story apart because there's a fucking track there.

67
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:28,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there's no reason that you know.

68
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,461
Speaker 1: I read up the east side path and I run.

69
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:39,770
Speaker 0: I run loops on Randall's Island and I Had and it's like where can you run in Manhattan if you say side west side, there's an apart, right?

70
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,483
Speaker 0: There's an enormous park in the middle and there's things on the edge.

71
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:51,430
Speaker 0: if you're in the middle part That's south of Central Park or north of Central Park too far away from it.

72
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:53,724
Speaker 0: Are you gonna take a subway ride to then run?

73
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:54,569
Speaker 0: It's like no.

74
00:03:55,453 --> 00:04:00,430
Speaker 0: No in this case the like the tiny little park and run in a tiny circle.

75
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:06,090
Speaker 1: It so happens that in this particular place the sidewalk was wide and completely open.

76
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,073
Speaker 1: There were no people anywhere.

77
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:11,950
Speaker 1: The only people on this whole street were these two women running in the little narrow bike lane.

78
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:21,624
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they just you know, yeah, but I to my credit I did not laugh out loud because I because it was really like.

79
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:26,221
Speaker 1: it's hard to describe how funny it was How quickly the situation people turn and bonk?

80
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:26,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can imagine.

81
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,690
Speaker 0: I'm already laughing it just my imagination.

82
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:35,588
Speaker 1: So there's so much big news that happened today that we're only gonna cover a couple of things cuz there.

83
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,771
Speaker 0: really I don't think there's That much.

84
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:39,480
Speaker 1: there's a lot of political news that you probably didn't pay attention to.

85
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:40,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

86
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:46,789
Speaker 0: it's probably just more of the same news is continuing and you're like you make a big deal out of some Development.

87
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:47,959
Speaker 0: that doesn't actually mean anything.

88
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,591
Speaker 1: Wasn't talking about US politics.

89
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:54,506
Speaker 0: But anyway Say, you know the same thing around the world.

90
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:55,409
Speaker 1: one thing I can.

91
00:04:55,429 --> 00:05:00,626
Speaker 1: so one thing that happened in the cryptocurrency world Which is a scam just to be sure.

92
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:03,294
Speaker 1: So there's a situation right now.

93
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:05,480
Speaker 1: I am NOT giving investment advice of any kind.

94
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:06,606
Speaker 1: This is my person.

95
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:07,028
Speaker 0: I am.

96
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:12,492
Speaker 0: don't buy any crypto anything at any No matter what it costs no matter what.

97
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,480
Speaker 0: avoid all crypto nonsense.

98
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,643
Speaker 0: Do not touch.

99
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:21,520
Speaker 1: all I will say is that Scott is a very intelligent person and I trust his judgment generally on things.

100
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,469
Speaker 0: So no matter what happens don't touch it.

101
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,415
Speaker 0: So don't let anyone you know touch it.

102
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,920
Speaker 1: There's a couple things going on I want to highlight cuz it's a weird situation.

103
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing that is specifically like there are laws and regulations to make this not happen In real finance, so there's a fair shit coin Which is what Wall Street actually calls most crypto currencies anything like doge and shiba.

104
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:54,979
Speaker 1: You'll see people literally just call them shit coin in professional settings Which is really funny sometimes when it's like an old trader guy being like, oh, yeah, I got options on this shit coin.

105
00:05:55,822 --> 00:06:00,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, man, it's pretty much, you know, this Bitcoin and there's the etherium one and everything else a shit coin.

106
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:02,786
Speaker 1: So I also will make it clear.

107
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:14,331
Speaker 1: I am merely stating opinion and other people's reporting and I am not necessarily saying that I That's not to say the Bitcoin and a theory of aren't also shit, which they are Yeah, but they're not shit coins as a term.

108
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,059
Speaker 1: That is kind of a for real term.

109
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:23,479
Speaker 1: So yes, there was a shit coin that you have all heard of called the doge coin Which was made as a joke, but now people are all made as a joke.

110
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,034
Speaker 0: Well as a single one of them they made it in the good.

111
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:28,340
Speaker 1: They didn't even make it to make money.

112
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,399
Speaker 1: They made it to be funny, but then people started using it.

113
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:34,000
Speaker 0: So they made a theory him too because they were mad about World of Warcraft.

114
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,785
Speaker 0: So someone is true.

115
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,170
Speaker 0: That's not an exaggeration.

116
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,839
Speaker 1: I mean, wait till people find out what mount gox came from.

117
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:47,279
Speaker 1: so Anyway, there's a coin a shit coin called Shiba Inu.

118
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:54,260
Speaker 1: It is just this garbage coin that is just a picture of a Shiba, you know, and there's like trillions of them.

119
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,309
Speaker 1: They're worth like nothing individually.

120
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you make up your own coin, you can mint as many as you want.

121
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,391
Speaker 0: So this coin suddenly you make the rules got it.

122
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:08,520
Speaker 1: so many people bought this coin like just now That it is in the top 10 cryptocurrencies on earth.

123
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:13,253
Speaker 1: It has more capital market value on paper than like Pinterest or Etsy does.

124
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,840
Speaker 1: it is like huge now top 10, right?

125
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:28,289
Speaker 0: But that capital market value is calculated by saying, okay Well the most recent person to buy this for real money paid this much for one coin Multiplied by the number of coins that exist.

126
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,778
Speaker 0: and the number of coins that exist was what did you say?

127
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:31,440
Speaker 0: trillions like?

128
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but people selling paid.

129
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:38,160
Speaker 0: So someone paid a penny a real US penny for one of these coins.

130
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:45,960
Speaker 0: Then the total market value would be a trillion divided by a hundred right, which is still enormous.

131
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:53,558
Speaker 1: so it is Skyrocketing right now and people keep buying it so you could sell it for those prices at least.

132
00:07:53,658 --> 00:08:00,060
Speaker 1: right now People are not buying these coins with actual money.

133
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:04,183
Speaker 1: They're buying them with another crypto currency Called tether.

134
00:08:04,224 --> 00:08:09,179
Speaker 1: like more than 80% of all the purchases of this coin are using tether a different coin.

135
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,860
Speaker 1: That coin is pegged to the US dollar.

136
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:17,332
Speaker 1: So theoretically one tether coin is always worth exactly one US dollar.

137
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:20,260
Speaker 0: So if I want to go buy some tether, right?

138
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:28,300
Speaker 0: Like I give a US dollar to someone and I get a tether Right, so I could be buying that from someone who has a tether already.

139
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:34,861
Speaker 0: Yep, right, but I at some point they need to mint more tethers Right.

140
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:43,990
Speaker 1: Oh, so the way they did this was by saying they will hold dollars for every tether coin that exists Like a go like there's a backing to the.

141
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,799
Speaker 0: so I could go to the main bank of tether And if I give them a US dollar and they'll put it in their vault and mint a tether and give it to me.

142
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:52,719
Speaker 1: So that's what they said.

143
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,033
Speaker 1: Turns out and there's a ton of reporting on this.

144
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:57,360
Speaker 1: the feds are investigating them.

145
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,960
Speaker 0: So what dollars are they using to pay their bills if they're keeping them all in the vault?

146
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,200
Speaker 1: So they do not appear to actually have the dollars that they said they have don't say yeah surprise.

147
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:17,939
Speaker 1: So people are using the pegged back Chip coin that's probably fake to buy the sheep coin that is currently pumped.

148
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:27,863
Speaker 1: and All of this leads to the third factor that makes this ridiculous 70% of all the Shiba Inu coins are owned by Ten people.

149
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:35,240
Speaker 1: well ten wallets ten wallets could be one person could be one person and no more than ten entities.

150
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:40,940
Speaker 0: Oh, it could be more than ten entities because they could like share the wallet number with each other Like, you know a married couple or something?

151
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that get.

152
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:52,574
Speaker 1: that gets weirdly complicated because of the way the habit wallets I'm just saying technically right but what that means is that Most of those coins are owned by probably the people who are doing the pump and dump.

153
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:58,152
Speaker 1: and if those people sell even a tiny Fraction of their coins they'll cash out and everyone else.

154
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,420
Speaker 1: It'll drop down to zero basically, right?

155
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,292
Speaker 0: So the point all you have to do to avoid this scam is don't buy crypto currency Don't buy the coins right because that person cash.

156
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:14,017
Speaker 0: in order for that person to cash out and be wealthy They need to actually at the end of the day convince real people.

157
00:10:14,057 --> 00:10:18,595
Speaker 0: they had to be like, okay I'm ready to sell all these coins in this wallet this trillion coins.

158
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:19,820
Speaker 0: You'd actually need.

159
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,865
Speaker 1: I checked it's.

160
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:26,100
Speaker 1: it's now 78% of all sheep coins are held by like 10 people.

161
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:29,919
Speaker 0: Right, but you need to go and find someone to actually buy those coins from you.

162
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,868
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what the number says on the Market website or whatever.

163
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,306
Speaker 0: if you can't find people to who will actually buy them from you It's like I'll be a billionaire.

164
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:44,100
Speaker 0: You have to find people who will collectively give you a billion dollars.

165
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it.

166
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:47,407
Speaker 0: that's not gonna have.

167
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,676
Speaker 1: there's this concept of a limit order book and liquidity.

168
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:53,690
Speaker 1: if there's a really liquid stock There's tons of people buy it and sell it it.

169
00:10:54,134 --> 00:11:00,760
Speaker 1: if it's not that liquid You'll see a book where there's a ton of people willing to sell it and there's like one weird nerd willing to buy it.

170
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:01,178
Speaker 1: And what's that?

171
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,564
Speaker 0: We're you got all you got.

172
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:07,423
Speaker 0: imagine the gathering black Lotus right which is tech, you know back in my day It was worth $300.

173
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,980
Speaker 0: I don't know what it's worth now according to you know, the price guys.

174
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,609
Speaker 0: It was worth $300 back then.

175
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:16,923
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's worth much more now But if you had one It's like.

176
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:23,006
Speaker 0: in order to get the $300 you had to find a human being with $300 who would Agree to the exchange.

177
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:26,883
Speaker 0: it wasn't like cash where it's just guaranteed $300.

178
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:33,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, of course, it wasn't hard to find such a person But it you know, it wasn't like a guarantee.

179
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:43,669
Speaker 0: But if you want to sell a million crap coins that are technically worth a dollar each to get a million dollars You have to find someone who has a million dollars.

180
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:49,168
Speaker 1: All right, so in January a black Lotus sold for five hundred and eleven thousand dollars.

181
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,480
Speaker 0: I Just robbed that fucking kid who had a whole binder full of them in.

182
00:11:57,123 --> 00:12:08,993
Speaker 0: Literally in 1993 I was at a table and at the same table as me with someone with one of those binders where there's you know Nine cards per page and they had several pages of just black lotuses.

183
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:17,753
Speaker 1: I was in a tournament where they had a Contest where if you had a chaos orb, which is also a valuable magic card It was a card with a gimmick where you'd like throw it at the table.

184
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:18,517
Speaker 0: I know I had.

185
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,140
Speaker 0: we had that card.

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's that car.

187
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,992
Speaker 0: I don't know if I still have it, but I might have.

188
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:28,379
Speaker 1: it was moderately valuable at the time and the contest was you had to have What at least one of those cards?

189
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:45,380
Speaker 1: You could enter the contest as many times as you wanted once per card and the contest was who can throw their chaos orb the furthest And the winner got a black Lotus Mmm, but you're risking damaging your all at the time also relatively valuable chaos orb.

190
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:49,860
Speaker 0: Well, a chaos orb is the same as any other magic card, so what a practice throwing forests.

191
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:54,400
Speaker 1: And yeah, you don't fight like you get one shot with the real card, right?

192
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,160
Speaker 0: If my once I got my forest throw real down pat and I was sure I was gonna win then I would enter.

193
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:02,990
Speaker 0: But if I couldn't get the forest throw down then I wouldn't enter.

194
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,720
Speaker 1: All right pass orbs today are worth like three grand.

195
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:08,126
Speaker 0: All right, maybe I got one.

196
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,271
Speaker 0: if I got one I'll sell it.

197
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:09,893
Speaker 0: What's?

198
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,460
Speaker 0: I know I have a demonic tutor.

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,042
Speaker 0: What's that worth?

200
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:14,690
Speaker 1: Uh, I feel like that's though.

201
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,595
Speaker 1: I think that was actually only an uncommon card.

202
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:17,117
Speaker 1: Technically.

203
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,722
Speaker 1: I have a bunch of them Let's see.

204
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,628
Speaker 0: I got a copy artifact.

205
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:21,872
Speaker 0: Maybe what else do I have?

206
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:22,353
Speaker 0: soul ring?

207
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:24,580
Speaker 1: I mean, I have a complete revised set.

208
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,468
Speaker 0: Doesn't have moxes and black lotuses.

209
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:33,223
Speaker 1: No because boxes and black lotuses were they Unlimited was the last set.

210
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:33,805
Speaker 1: those were in.

211
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:40,739
Speaker 1: yeah demonic tutor three grand for a high quality one 40 bucks 40 bucks for ours.

212
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:45,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine mines the the used one ours are worth about.

213
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,140
Speaker 0: he actually tutored a card with it.

214
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,776
Speaker 1: What value my tutor was in every fucking deck I made cuz.

215
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:51,258
Speaker 0: of course it is.

216
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:53,889
Speaker 0: It's actually a good card.

217
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:54,190
Speaker 0: All right.

218
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,158
Speaker 1: So speaking of financial shenanigans This is another story that's nuts and I actually kind of approve of what they did.

219
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:01,760
Speaker 1: This is cool.

220
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:08,805
Speaker 1: So there's an Andy Warhol pen drawing Of fairies, it's good was called.

221
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:09,446
Speaker 1: what fairies?

222
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,710
Speaker 0: I don't know.

223
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,231
Speaker 0: I've never.

224
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,475
Speaker 0: I didn't see it until today.

225
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,847
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's a Original Andy Warhol artwork.

226
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:21,520
Speaker 0: He the actual Andy Warhol held a pen drew this artwork on a piece of paper.

227
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,846
Speaker 0: It's a physical artifact.

228
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a bullshit NFT.

229
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:25,236
Speaker 0: It's a real one.

230
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:30,773
Speaker 1: Yeah It was valuable because Andy Warhol physically touched it.

231
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:33,320
Speaker 1: we know for a fact it is the original.

232
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,012
Speaker 1: Absolutely, the chain of Providence is unbroken and It's sold recently to a group for a reasonable size of some of money.

233
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,399
Speaker 1: They bought they paid 20 grand for it.

234
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:47,274
Speaker 0: That's for an Andy an original Andy Warhol.

235
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:47,917
Speaker 0: That's okay.

236
00:14:48,239 --> 00:15:05,360
Speaker 1: Yep So then they used they analyzed it they scanned it they used printing materials and like a machine that will draw with a pen to make Extremely high quality forgeries of this drive.

237
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:12,465
Speaker 0: But but the thing is those forgeries even if you so I think the technique they used was like, you know They had like a robot.

238
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:16,680
Speaker 0: He'll hold a pen and move it around a piece of paper, right with more.

239
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:17,282
Speaker 1: I look.

240
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,970
Speaker 1: they actually did more than you think they did.

241
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,782
Speaker 0: they get the exact right paper and the that's only got the right Exact.

242
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:25,146
Speaker 0: they got right ink.

243
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,855
Speaker 1: So it looks like they got correct ink.

244
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:29,440
Speaker 1: They also got correct old ink.

245
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:35,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently Otherwise because the idea is that no one should be able to tell right.

246
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:40,300
Speaker 0: but you could tell with some aging Techniques if you didn't use old paper and old pen.

247
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:41,222
Speaker 0: Yeah You could also.

248
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,185
Speaker 0: they might did.

249
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:45,838
Speaker 0: the specialist might be able to detect when the ink dried and then you'd be in.

250
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,460
Speaker 0: they'd get you.

251
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:53,777
Speaker 1: so part of what they did too is that the robot actually Recreates the like the strokes of the pen in the right order and the depths and everything.

252
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:59,916
Speaker 1: so Supposedly so far they've had a lot of experts examine these and nobody can tell the difference.

253
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:04,960
Speaker 0: Nobody can get it Right, I think you would need to use like, you know, you couldn't do it with like your magnifying glass.

254
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:12,327
Speaker 0: You would need to do it with like, you know Some kind of science like, you know, take a piece of the paper and you know, so we don't know We don't know.

255
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,579
Speaker 0: I don't know what kind of stuff they do.

256
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,334
Speaker 1: So we don't know if someone will ever prove which one is the original again.

257
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:22,763
Speaker 1: So now they're selling all Thousand of these for $250 each.

258
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:28,660
Speaker 1: so basically you can pay $250 for a one in a thousand chance of having an original a war haul.

259
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:33,520
Speaker 0: That's the same as when they sell, you know expensive raffle tickets for a luxury car.

260
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:36,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, same deal, but there's more to it than that.

261
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,663
Speaker 1: They have themselves Shall they?

262
00:16:39,683 --> 00:16:42,980
Speaker 1: they randomized it such that they don't know which one is the original anymore either?

263
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:44,786
Speaker 0: How do you know that they did that?

264
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:45,730
Speaker 0: That's the best the thing.

265
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,103
Speaker 0: they could have made a thousand forgeries and lock the real one Just and left.

266
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:50,486
Speaker 1: so it's.

267
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:56,373
Speaker 1: I hope that they have not cheated this and that they honestly don't know because that makes us a thousand times funnier.

268
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,565
Speaker 1: You'd read the article because it's either.

269
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:03,499
Speaker 0: the point is the profits on this right minus the cost of them to make the reproductions, right?

270
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,103
Speaker 0: $250 times a thousand is 250 grand.

271
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:05,925
Speaker 0: They made a profit of 230 grand.

272
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:20,238
Speaker 1: Yep, and even better Think about what this does on one hand protect Assume they did it right and no one can tell and the chain of Providence is broken Which is what they are trying to do.

273
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:29,019
Speaker 1: They just turned and they destroyed the idea of their being an original and there are now a thousand functionally identical originals.

274
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:36,779
Speaker 1: Good the argument being do you appreciate the art or are you paying for the fact that this one human touched this?

275
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:42,427
Speaker 1: And my argument is that here's the real question Is a stupid thing to care about right?

276
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:49,189
Speaker 0: if you appreciate the art then you should be fine Buying one that is known to be fake.

277
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:49,911
Speaker 0: just get a print.

278
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:54,194
Speaker 0: and if you if you're okay getting a print You can get a print for less than 250 dollars.

279
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,425
Speaker 1: I mean we have a painting in the bed.

280
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:57,127
Speaker 0: anyone pay.

281
00:17:57,268 --> 00:18:02,784
Speaker 0: anyone spending the 250 is not someone who only Appreciates the art.

282
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:12,966
Speaker 0: right because you could just if you only wanted to have this particular artwork You know to in a physical form to hang on your wall or something you could get it for less than 250.

283
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:18,377
Speaker 1: Yep In fact high quality prints like you can get painting prints that also have the 3d texture like other that know.

284
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,860
Speaker 1: only an expert is Gonna even notice that it's not identical to the original.

285
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,935
Speaker 0: Well, I think they'll know because it's the Mona Lisa and your house is not the Louvre.

286
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:27,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, you come over.

287
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,109
Speaker 1: It's like rims that a new Picasso Like.

288
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:40,149
Speaker 0: Right, it's we know because we're in your apartment and your We know but it's not the other.

289
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,695
Speaker 1: the other cool thing about this is basically what it did.

290
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:44,700
Speaker 1: is it turned this one work?

291
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,940
Speaker 1: Into a thousand shares of this work.

292
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:55,040
Speaker 1: You're almost buying one thousandth of the original work and then you get a token that is the work itself to appreciate.

293
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,281
Speaker 1: It's.

294
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:59,494
Speaker 1: it's just an interesting art project as a whole like the thing.

295
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:07,619
Speaker 0: I do appreciate it as a Commentary on you know, the the art world and also the you know, the very present NFT world.

296
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:12,142
Speaker 0: Yep so laughing in their face, so I hope I Really?

297
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:16,135
Speaker 1: Hope no one ever figures out what the original one was ever.

298
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:21,960
Speaker 0: I hope it is actually impossible I bet they you know, the other thing is they could have like destroyed after scanning.

299
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,270
Speaker 0: They could have just gotten rid of the original.

300
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,177
Speaker 1: that would have been a pro move.

301
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:29,514
Speaker 0: No the pro No one can tell because they're all actually identical because they're all fake ones.

302
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:31,220
Speaker 0: The real one is somewhere, you know.

303
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,924
Speaker 1: Well the probe.

304
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:34,220
Speaker 1: you know what I would do if I was running this company.

305
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:38,420
Speaker 1: I'd sell a thousand fakes and the original would just be in my house and I would never tell anyone.

306
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,969
Speaker 0: Well, someone would find out when you died or whatever.

307
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,875
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I'm dead at that point.

308
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,477
Speaker 1: Who cares?

309
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:48,893
Speaker 1: Oh In my will my will will literally just be fuck you.

310
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,659
Speaker 1: I had the original bury with me.

311
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I want to be able to.

312
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:56,488
Speaker 0: I want to go.

313
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:59,697
Speaker 0: the laugh from the afterlife continued at.

314
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:02,894
Speaker 0: my continued scam Continues to scam.

315
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:06,985
Speaker 1: be right before you die you launch it into space in a low-earth orbit.

316
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:12,883
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway anyway in the final big news we should.

317
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:20,170
Speaker 1: well one big news recently talked about Facebook as was rumored changed his name officially to meta and they're doing a whole thing.

318
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,481
Speaker 1: We'll probably talk about that more on Mondays and Tuesdays where it's more relevant.

319
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, there can as everyone predicted.

320
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:33,530
Speaker 0: They're trying to basically, you know Fulfill some dystopian cyberpunk dream and they're probably gonna fail.

321
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:48,965
Speaker 1: What I hate is that a lot of these tech bros when they think about the metaverse They're trying to recreate like the libertarian dystopia aspect of it with like property ownership and real estate and NFTs and bullshit instead of just a creative place for people to interact.

322
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,150
Speaker 1: We'll see how this goes.

323
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think they read too much snow crash.

324
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:55,950
Speaker 0: It's like we need to get them watching more ghosts in the shell, right?

325
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, cyber space should be this place where you know information is Granted.

326
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,180
Speaker 1: what happens in ghost in the shell?

327
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:13,530
Speaker 1: because in standalone complex and second gig Every time the major goes in spies on regular like not police cyber ninjas doing shit.

328
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:17,177
Speaker 1: They're all just sharing ridiculous Conspiracy theories and being wrong about stuff.

329
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,370
Speaker 0: and for my call but I'm saying but that's the button goes kind of like the real world.

330
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:29,770
Speaker 0: Most of the message of ghosts in the shell isn't about the cyberspace It's about the you know, the the combination of you know, your body with with technology man machine interface.

331
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:39,258
Speaker 0: What is man wise machine since we're not since we're not cyborg ng at least we are cyborg ng, but we're not you know Robot brain cyborg in our lifetimes.

332
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:48,279
Speaker 0: most likely right that if you just look at the cyberspace In the ghost in the shell world on its own It's a lot more like the real one.

333
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,073
Speaker 0: It's just like a place of free information sharing Yeah, and it doesn't.

334
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,220
Speaker 0: there's no ownership in cyberspace.

335
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:06,830
Speaker 0: There's power because you might have more computing power at your disposal Or you might have control over information if you have large computing systems You know or satellites or who knows what hardware you own in the real world.

336
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:11,830
Speaker 0: But there's no ownership in the cyberspace itself and that's yeah the correct way.

337
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:15,285
Speaker 1: But I am regardless of the technology and what they're trying to build.

338
00:22:15,305 --> 00:22:16,370
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that another time.

339
00:22:16,831 --> 00:22:18,476
Speaker 1: I am so confident.

340
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:26,125
Speaker 1: the reason they are changing their name is not because of the new project but because they have fully internalized that the brand.

341
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:33,469
Speaker 1: Facebook is Permanently poisoned and toxic to anyone who is not wearing blinders and over the age of like 50 at this point.

342
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:39,410
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's also like young people like Facebook is what old people use to like buy horse paste.

343
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:42,869
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know Google right they got their alphabet thing.

344
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:52,139
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like but that was clearly just a corporate like shell company to be able to be flexible for like Corporate governance and like finance reasons and regulatory.

345
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,810
Speaker 0: I think that that's also a reason that Facebook is doing this also, right?

346
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,666
Speaker 0: You know Facebook is just one product that of what of the many things that meta will.

347
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:01,670
Speaker 1: but here's the difference.

348
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,057
Speaker 1: Google kept the Google brand on almost everything.

349
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:06,304
Speaker 1: No one talks about out the brand on.

350
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:08,310
Speaker 0: they're gonna eat the Facebook brand on Facebook.

351
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:13,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, but meta doesn't have the Facebook brand on it because they got to get rid of that Facebook brand.

352
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,320
Speaker 0: The alphabet doesn't have the Google brand on.

353
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,956
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz Google doesn't have the alphabet brand on it either It doesn't.

354
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:28,450
Speaker 1: Facebook isn't gonna have the meta brand on it Yeah, but I'm pretty sure Facebook is going to be in a long decline to eventually being destroyed or merged.

355
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:41,149
Speaker 0: Well, there have been many many rumors, you know of and and you know some people with pretty good, you know takes Showing like yeah, you know, why is Facebook doing the things it's doing is because it's just not doing well.

356
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,510
Speaker 0: But you know long-term financially it's like yes social networks.

357
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,173
Speaker 0: That's how they do.

358
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,930
Speaker 0: they rise and then they fall that the young people are not using the Facebook.

359
00:23:49,352 --> 00:24:01,230
Speaker 0: It's they got this large group of old people and Facebook Recognizes that even if it has such a large user base that it will last for quite a while It only sells so much horse pace to so many QAnon.

360
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,741
Speaker 0: All the kids all the kids are using something else, right.

361
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:07,770
Speaker 0: so that's why Facebook acquired the Instagram and the whatsapp.

362
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:11,019
Speaker 0: But you know those things too, right?

363
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:15,190
Speaker 0: It's like they'll fade just like myspace faded right everything over time.

364
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,742
Speaker 0: It's like here's a user base and then the new people use something else and they recognize.

365
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:29,610
Speaker 0: if they just stay as Facebook with that Social garbage social network as their primary business that at some point, you know could be a decade could be who knows?

366
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:36,028
Speaker 0: It's just gonna go downhill and that's gonna be it and that that time would be within Zuck's life.

367
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:36,709
Speaker 0: He's not that old.

368
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:47,150
Speaker 0: So he has in personal incentive since if he was really old He might not do this because he'd be dead by the time Facebook died, but you know, he's unlikely to die soon.

369
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:55,430
Speaker 0: So he needs to make sure that you know, if the Facebook dies within his life that the company he's still CEO of something important.

370
00:24:55,991 --> 00:25:05,136
Speaker 1: Now the other thing going on here is remember those all the whistleblowers and all those Facebook papers leaked recently in Congress investigating and Yeah, there's a lot of risk involved.

371
00:25:05,156 --> 00:25:09,110
Speaker 0: They might you might lose the Instagram and the whatsapp if there's any trust that breaks them up.

372
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:22,087
Speaker 1: Well in the last ten days We've seen revelations that as bad as we thought Facebook was as bad as I talk about Facebook being it is It did things that are so much worse than I even imagined.

373
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:35,660
Speaker 1: and this stuff Imagined all those things, you know, I did not specifically but in general Yeah, but the worst part is you can see clear evidence that every smart person inside of Facebook was Constantly raising the alarm.

374
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,150
Speaker 1: people were quitting over this stuff.

375
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:47,739
Speaker 1: people are constantly raising ethics complaints and it was all ignored in the name of engagement and protecting the User base of primarily angry conservatives.

376
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:53,820
Speaker 0: there were you know, I'm not gonna say that like this, you know There were many many instances of what you just described.

377
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:54,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were.

378
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:58,990
Speaker 0: if you read all the documents I didn't read all of them, but I read the handful.

379
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:06,149
Speaker 0: I guess there were a few instances where they did take the advice and made things better that is

380
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:06,450
Speaker 1: true

381
00:26:07,253 --> 00:26:18,679
Speaker 0: but those happened to be cases where Taking the advice and making things better was not a severe, you know damage to the to the bottom line Yep,

382
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:24,250
Speaker 1: and that Facebook still needs to be broken up and literally shut down.

383
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,850
Speaker 1: It is a material threat to modern democracy, right?

384
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,750
Speaker 0: But Facebook is wasn't you know, anyone who's like all Facebook is being evil for the sake of being evil.

385
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,662
Speaker 0: No, they're starting anybody, you know, they figure it out.

386
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,630
Speaker 0: It's only for the sake that capitalist.

387
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,835
Speaker 0: You know motive is the motive right?

388
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:49,968
Speaker 0: They're not like hey, hey, hey, let's have people die and spread, you know vaccine misinfo Like hey if you if you stops people from spreading vaccine misinfo they stop using Facebook.

389
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:53,246
Speaker 0: shit Yeah, and then we make less money on ads.

390
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:57,559
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so last there's two other little newses.

391
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:14,446
Speaker 1: in our hometown of New York City in Queens in Astoria We won a fight like the people of Astoria to not put a big Basically gas-powered plants right in the middle of popular air in our neighborhood.

392
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,936
Speaker 0: There's already two Generation lance.

393
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not like the main power plants.

394
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,850
Speaker 0: They're you know, those the ones that turn on and help out when the you know, we're all got our air conditioners.

395
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and it's you know.

396
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,176
Speaker 0: They actually call it asthma alley.

397
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:29,561
Speaker 0: because what do you know?

398
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:34,956
Speaker 0: the largest public housing project in the world is right next to one Yep, and there's another.

399
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:41,030
Speaker 0: there's two more right in between in the in the in the space between the two different power plants.

400
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:44,410
Speaker 0: Not only is my apartment but two more so three.

401
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,438
Speaker 1: So they only put these power plants where poor people live.

402
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,549
Speaker 0: three total large public housing projects including the largest in the nation.

403
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:56,550
Speaker 0: So It's called asthma alley because guess what kids who grow up in this particular area?

404
00:27:56,851 --> 00:28:08,750
Speaker 0: They have more asthma than the highway higher significantly higher rate than kids who live and I don't know a green Rich people mansion full of trees and yeah with no power plants nearby because nimby's won't let it a power plant now.

405
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:18,823
Speaker 1: We do need power plants But they not yet built in places that make sense from a scientific and social perspective Not from a where rich people want them to go.

406
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:20,290
Speaker 0: perspective, right?

407
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:29,063
Speaker 0: So they were basically, you know planning to you know, sort of stem the tide or whatever and you know upgrade Add another.

408
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:47,196
Speaker 0: you know Power plant on the north end that was going to burning like fracked gas gas that was obtained via Fracking which we shouldn't be fracking in the first place but it's you know natural gas power plant and the people got together and We nimby'd that.

409
00:28:47,497 --> 00:28:48,502
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm right.

410
00:28:48,522 --> 00:28:50,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it wasn't a wrong nimby.

411
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:59,800
Speaker 1: Well what I've read I was like grades were unnecessary and all they do is continue to invest in fossil fuels rather than alternatives Right, so I was.

412
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:03,094
Speaker 0: I was like, hey listen, you know Feel free.

413
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:04,238
Speaker 0: I wasn't nimbying.

414
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:06,846
Speaker 0: I was like look feel free to build a power plant build.

415
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,050
Speaker 0: You could build two power plants.

416
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:16,218
Speaker 0: You know the power plant Right next door to my fucking house as long as it's like a solar plant or a wind plant Yeah, or some kind of geotherm.

417
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:16,660
Speaker 0: I don't know.

418
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,949
Speaker 0: nothing does something that doesn't fucking burn.

419
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, put up a thorium salt.

420
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:24,130
Speaker 1: put a thorium salt reactor right next to my apartment.

421
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:27,884
Speaker 1: I would pray I would fly would crowdfund that shit nuke.

422
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:31,590
Speaker 0: Oh, you could put the nuclear one there I don't care because remember kids coal power plants.

423
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:34,178
Speaker 0: Well modern good kind and not the old shitty kind.

424
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:35,662
Speaker 1: even the old shitty kind is.

425
00:29:35,682 --> 00:29:41,079
Speaker 0: I'd take over any coal plant coal over over Yes, but I would if there's that's.

426
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:47,729
Speaker 0: that's something that if they were gonna build the old shitty kind I'd go out there with a protest sign say yeah, please build the newer better kind.

427
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,682
Speaker 1: But that's that's something that a lot of environmental activists like to forget.

428
00:29:51,742 --> 00:29:58,670
Speaker 1: like they'll they'll point out the damage and danger Of like a second generation nuclear power plant like one of the old light water reactors.

429
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:01,970
Speaker 1: But it's not light water reactor or nothing.

430
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,901
Speaker 1: It's light water reactor or coal or oil or something equally shitty.

431
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:14,164
Speaker 1: or worse coal power plants release more new radiation into the atmosphere Than all nuclear power plants combined ever have including Chernobyl and three-mile island.

432
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so how did we stop this?

433
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,313
Speaker 0: Well, there were a few Like.

434
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:19,558
Speaker 0: that's the reason I want to talk about.

435
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:22,970
Speaker 0: it is because it's like hey a bad politics was gonna happen and we stopped it.

436
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:34,186
Speaker 0: So looking at how we stopped it is important if a bad politics is gonna happen near you and you live in a democracy Right, so there are three three key things that we did to stop it, right?

437
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:35,250
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I guess a few.

438
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:36,490
Speaker 0: They're all kind of related.

439
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:42,689
Speaker 0: But the number one thing to stop it was that we got lucky and changed the governor at the right time.

440
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:47,603
Speaker 0: The governor the old governor would have done it and we that governor got booted.

441
00:30:47,623 --> 00:30:50,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got a new governor who didn't do it.

442
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:51,473
Speaker 0: That's the main thing.

443
00:30:51,494 --> 00:31:07,329
Speaker 1: new governor has actually been pretty stand-up so far to be a new governor wants to get reelected very badly Yeah, so there If competition as good as she is we're still gonna primary from as far left as we can Probably yeah.

444
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,845
Speaker 0: So that's that's the key number.

445
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:16,130
Speaker 0: second key Obviously, you can't replicate the first one unless you go hire private investigator to spy on the governor.

446
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:18,870
Speaker 0: Granted bad politician find a skeleton in their closet.

447
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,433
Speaker 0: I don't know.

448
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:23,070
Speaker 1: the more conservative a politician is the more skeletons tend to be in their closets.

449
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:28,309
Speaker 0: So harder to get those skeletons that is harder to get heart and harder to get anyone to care about those skeletons.

450
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:31,235
Speaker 1: Yep I mean Half the Republicans out there.

451
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:35,529
Speaker 1: their skeletons are like out paraded around on a daily basis and they still get really good.

452
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,195
Speaker 0: Well, I mean compare right?

453
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,724
Speaker 0: Anthony Weiner skeleton came out career over.

454
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:40,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, not.

455
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:41,490
Speaker 0: not that he's good.

456
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,465
Speaker 0: I'm just saying he was a Democrat and his skeleton there are out and his career was over.

457
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:46,610
Speaker 1: skeletons only.

458
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,261
Speaker 0: What about the comedy guy who was the senator at Franken?

459
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:49,803
Speaker 0: right out?

460
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:51,550
Speaker 0: skeleton out career over, right?

461
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,580
Speaker 0: But then what do you got in the Republican side with the gates guy?

462
00:31:54,902 --> 00:31:57,050
Speaker 0: tell a thousand six-foot skeletons?

463
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,593
Speaker 0: They're like five.

464
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:02,771
Speaker 1: they're dancing around doing the xylophone thing in his front yard Exactly.

465
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:15,610
Speaker 0: So the second thing that we did is not just did we protest and organize and do all those normal protest things that you Right, but our local politicians were on our side helping us organizing.

466
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:16,338
Speaker 0: So that was good.

467
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,369
Speaker 0: that helped as well.

468
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:28,369
Speaker 0: but the in during those protests activities there were two main activities that helped the most because Number one they had to take by law.

469
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:33,050
Speaker 0: Public comments there was not like some change org bullshit, right?

470
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:39,281
Speaker 0: We're talking, you know Agency that was in charge of this had to have a public comment period.

471
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:46,490
Speaker 0: then we submitted official public comments that go in the record and 85% of those comments are saying what the fuck are you doing?

472
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:47,954
Speaker 0: Right.

473
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:52,720
Speaker 0: and the second thing was they had to have a public hearings Right where people actually were.

474
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:12,086
Speaker 0: they were digital because it was the zoom times and you go to the public hearing and make a public comment in person and Pretty much 99.9% of the people who bothered to go there which was quite a few people because they were organized Went there and went to their face and said you're the person who can decide to do this or not.

475
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:17,615
Speaker 0: I live here don't do it and That was pretty significant.

476
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:23,790
Speaker 0: right, you know your change that org ain't gonna do nothing, but your your official Public comment will do something.

477
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:43,007
Speaker 0: So if something's happening and you don't like it and you wanted to stop from happening You should find out if there is official public comment or public hearing and Organize to spam that shit and that will have an impact of some kind and prevent you from going up from two power plants to three.

478
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:54,317
Speaker 1: Last last little thing so Not to belabor the point but the state of Texas in the United States has basically been speed running Destroy democracy lately.

479
00:33:54,377 --> 00:34:00,270
Speaker 1: like they have done so many egregious things as a state that We literally could not list them in a reasonable amount of time.

480
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:06,996
Speaker 0: It is several other states are watching that speed run on state Whatever and and they're gonna.

481
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:10,409
Speaker 0: they're learning all the strats and they're gonna copy whatever works democracy.

482
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:12,730
Speaker 0: They're all in the same discord channel working with each other.

483
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:18,355
Speaker 1: So Texas has done so many bad things that like like I'm boycotting Texas personally I will not do.

484
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,484
Speaker 1: I will not visit Texas.

485
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:19,888
Speaker 1: I will not do.

486
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:23,522
Speaker 0: I mean I wasn't even happy too happy about going to Texas before nope.

487
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:24,866
Speaker 1: We went to Texas for packs.

488
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:28,927
Speaker 1: That was the only times I ever Another way over the line.

489
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:40,409
Speaker 1: Yep Like I would I if there even is a pack South which I doubt Considering some of the things Texas did might literally prevent there from being a pack South like banning vaccine mandates for events.

490
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:51,225
Speaker 1: But it's gotten so bad that today the NAACP Has called for a very targeted boycott of Texas will likely see them call for more.

491
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:54,804
Speaker 1: They issued a very long Very powerful statement.

492
00:34:54,824 --> 00:35:05,230
Speaker 1: They're basically Urging all Professional athletes who are in free agency meeting if I mean this varies depending on the sport, but basically they could switch teams.

493
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:07,350
Speaker 1: There's no there's no like contract preventing them.

494
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:12,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, free agency means, you know, you can go to any team you want that you agreed to sign a contract with yep.

495
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:29,323
Speaker 1: So they're basically urging any athlete in any professional organ is sports of any kind To refuse to take free agency for any team in Texas until the voting laws the anti LGBT laws the I mean, there's like ten different things.

496
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:32,133
Speaker 1: the abortion laws are over peeled Mm-hmm.

497
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:42,930
Speaker 0: So yeah, I urge you to boycott Strategy, I don't know how many people are gonna listen if it'll matter but it's like yeah You you probably shouldn't go to work in Texas if you're a professional athlete.

498
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:52,270
Speaker 1: Yeah About this an individual person Has especially someone who is in a position of do I take a job in Texas or do I take no job?

499
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,610
Speaker 1: It's hard to blame a person for taking the job when the alternative is nothing and they're fine.

500
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:02,170
Speaker 0: I mean, there's several people I know who are considered good friends and they live in Texas.

501
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:11,670
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, I can't be like, you know, it's like I would like them to leave, Texas They might even want to leave or you know, they're not able to afford to right.

502
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,636
Speaker 0: It's like, you know and as bad as Texas is.

503
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:19,479
Speaker 0: it's like I don't blame the people of Texas for what is happening in, Texas Right, I blame 44% of the people of Texas, right?

504
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:21,841
Speaker 0: It's like the.

505
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:29,587
Speaker 0: you know There's a large number of people close to half even that are good people who don't like this or is half of the voting people.

506
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:34,383
Speaker 0: and You know, it's just the people who are causing the bad thing.

507
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:39,990
Speaker 0: Those are the you know, the politicians who run, Texas Those are the ones who must be you know be harmed, right?

508
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:52,690
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically the but the argument is that one if an athlete does this it's highly visible like it'll make up news And that person is not risking their personal livelihood the way that like some schmuck work in minimum wages.

509
00:36:53,492 --> 00:37:00,210
Speaker 0: Nope, and also there are people in Texas who may be bad people but also sports fans.

510
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:06,389
Speaker 0: Right if an athlete does this to them They'll obviously hate that athlete forever and have them on their shit list and boo them.

511
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:11,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're forced to play away games in Texas, by the way They should boycott away games in Texas.

512
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:14,420
Speaker 1: I think the NFL should just refuse to allow Texas teams to compete.

513
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:16,185
Speaker 0: Well, NFL is not gonna do that.

514
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:21,550
Speaker 0: I know they're not But I don't think you'd be able to go that far, right?

515
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,350
Speaker 0: You'll probably have to play away games in Texas if you're playing against a Texas team.

516
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:36,570
Speaker 1: well at some point we might have to because part of what the NAACP is arguing is that What's happening in Texas right now is the first domino of a very rapid destruction of democracy in America?

517
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:51,899
Speaker 1: And their argument is basically that we have to use every available tool even with collateral damage and harm as fast as possible to stop Texas from continuing down this path or Everyone in America is at extreme risk.

518
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,348
Speaker 0: We are been at extreme risk.

519
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:59,140
Speaker 1: Yep That's why I heard like if Pac South happens don't fucking go to it.

520
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:02,637
Speaker 0: I would not unless it's not in Texas.

521
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:08,936
Speaker 1: if they move it to like, Georgia or like a place that we might be able to You know the greatest but Georgia Georgia's do it.

522
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,085
Speaker 1: Okay, Georgia is fighting the fight a little bit.

523
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd go there right now I would go to.

524
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:15,041
Speaker 1: I would go to Georgia.

525
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:15,989
Speaker 1: I would not go to Texas.

526
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:23,210
Speaker 1: Not gonna Florida's in the shit list - yep, or bring it to Detroit the the most non-white big city in America.

527
00:38:23,712 --> 00:38:26,828
Speaker 1: That would be the most accessible packs that America wouldn't get any money.

528
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:44,514
Speaker 1: No one Yeah, but it would also be the packs that the most disenfranchised people and the most underprivileged I bet they could a lot of gamers with the ticket price, uh, you could run it pretty cheap in Detroit with I Bet the game.

529
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:46,843
Speaker 1: I mean the game industry showed up to Texas to a degree.

530
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:50,710
Speaker 1: I feel like to really just be easier barely anyway.

531
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:59,199
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day.

532
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:03,732
Speaker 1: so uh You ever wonder you know, most people drive manual transmissions.

533
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:11,320
Speaker 1: I would argue that in the modern world Automatic transmissions charges the default and it's weird to have a manual transmission like just get rid of them.

534
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,049
Speaker 1: They're done that ships.

535
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,392
Speaker 0: You might need it for racing or for some other Specialized cars for specialized a big truck, right?

536
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:19,035
Speaker 0: So, you know, yeah

537
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:32,335
Speaker 1: God double clutches anyway, I do not miss manual transmissions, but You ever you know as a kid with the manual transmission and even with an automatic always thought about like hey What if I just fucking put this thing in reverse while I'm on the freeway,

538
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:34,324
Speaker 0: but of course It'll stop you from doing that.

539
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,551
Speaker 1: Yeah automatic transmissions won't let you do that.

540
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:49,117
Speaker 1: But this video asked the question what if you just take a manual transmission car like a bog standard one and Just put it in reverse while you're going at speed and it is not.

541
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:49,820
Speaker 1: what do you expect?

542
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,102
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

543
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,922
Speaker 1: Yes, you can do it, but you gotta muscle it You gotta.

544
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:59,880
Speaker 1: it's actually physically hard to do but the car doesn't stop you from doing it if you make it work.

545
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:11,700
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and in this video the gentleman is able to make it happen at At a pretty high speed on a highway and it is really funny.

546
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,748
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'll leave it at that.

547
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:17,160
Speaker 1: You can skip through the video to find the good part.

548
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,957
Speaker 0: Otherwise, there's 10 minutes of a start YouTube comment that has the timecode in it to click on.

549
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:28,807
Speaker 1: Nope There but the guy spends 10 minutes talking about transmissions and honestly if you don't know anything about cars You'll probably learn a lot from this guy.

550
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,220
Speaker 0: should watch my thing of the day from a week or two ago with the guy who?

551
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,263
Speaker 0: Takes apart transmissions.

552
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:34,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, but manuals.

553
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:38,060
Speaker 1: manual transmissions are way simpler than automatic transmission.

554
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:39,889
Speaker 0: He does he did a manual at least once.

555
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's just so few people have manuals.

556
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,783
Speaker 0: So he did right.

557
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:44,431
Speaker 0: so it's like he's in a transmission shop.

558
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:46,200
Speaker 0: He's showing you what he's working on.

559
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,370
Speaker 0: It's like people come in for transmission repair.

560
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,620
Speaker 0: How many people come in with manuals not too many.

561
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:59,204
Speaker 1: So the last time I drove a manual transmission was in the year 2000 and Five.

562
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,534
Speaker 0: I Don't remember what probably last I probably last run.

563
00:41:02,574 --> 00:41:03,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was it.

564
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:12,202
Speaker 0: I think I haven't driven a real manual transmission since like so other than that truck the previous time before like 2005.

565
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:14,349
Speaker 1: ish that's your plenty of manuals though.

566
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:14,650
Speaker 0: Lots.

567
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:14,891
Speaker 0: What?

568
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:24,678
Speaker 1: Yeah was uh, it was the year When I borrowed my mom's Jeep Cherokee or yeah Jeep Wrangler Jeep Wrangler.

569
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:25,300
Speaker 1: that was manual.

570
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:28,430
Speaker 1: And uh, yeah, I stalled it out like five times.

571
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,155
Speaker 1: cuz I don't really drive manual transmissions.

572
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:35,724
Speaker 1: Even then I hadn't done it in a while anyway, so Nothing in the day here.

573
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:36,848
Speaker 0: We got this website.

574
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:39,860
Speaker 0: So the World Series is going down between two piece-of-shit teams.

575
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:40,524
Speaker 0: We got let's see.

576
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:42,600
Speaker 1: We've got the team with the racist tomahawk shot.

577
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:43,242
Speaker 0: We got the.

578
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:47,578
Speaker 0: we got racist Atlanta versus cheating, Texas actual cheating.

579
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:48,622
Speaker 1: go read about it Like we're not.

580
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:52,040
Speaker 1: even this is even worse than the whole like deflate gate thing, right?

581
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:59,439
Speaker 0: So basically no no good no good results here in the World Series just ignoring that garbage Garbage fire by the umpires.

582
00:42:00,282 --> 00:42:07,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's a website here that I didn't know about and a Twitter account called ump scorecards and what they do is really fascinating.

583
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:11,334
Speaker 0: I didn't realize they were collecting all this data and you know visualizing it and all that.

584
00:42:11,374 --> 00:42:13,140
Speaker 0: but it's just what it sounds like.

585
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:24,955
Speaker 0: they watch pretty much every pitch in baseball and They look at who the ump is look at whether they called a ball or a strike and then Looked at what the computer said.

586
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:32,420
Speaker 0: It should have been And say oh was that you know, how often does the ump get it wrong, you know, do they get it wrong?

587
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,168
Speaker 0: Are they really good up right?

588
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:36,541
Speaker 0: which ump's are better than others, you know Our.

589
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:40,719
Speaker 0: this is ump like biased towards like, you know high and inside or stuff like that.

590
00:42:41,482 --> 00:42:51,000
Speaker 0: And I'm sure this is not only useful to fans of baseball who love this shit But also I wouldn't be surprised if like teams are looking at this and saying all right, who's the ump today?

591
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:58,078
Speaker 0: Oh, you know that guy, you know He'll call you strikes if you even if you throw it a little low the pitcher knows that that can help you out.

592
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:05,474
Speaker 0: Yeah And this is all publicly available Very well organized and very well visualized data.

593
00:43:05,494 --> 00:43:06,999
Speaker 1: Imagine doing that for hockey like.

594
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:13,068
Speaker 1: ah We got the guy who never calls cross-checking And you can even like organize.

595
00:43:13,128 --> 00:43:14,733
Speaker 0: it's like the least accurate.

596
00:43:14,894 --> 00:43:19,285
Speaker 0: ump's are getting it right only like 91 percent of the time.

597
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:23,518
Speaker 0: it's like that means nine percent of almost one out of ten pitches.

598
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:24,462
Speaker 0: They're getting wrong That's.

599
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:25,450
Speaker 0: yeah, I think that's really.

600
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:26,539
Speaker 0: that's really bad, right?

601
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:31,365
Speaker 0: The best ump gets it right 96 percent of the time.

602
00:43:31,405 --> 00:43:33,712
Speaker 0: so that's that's not too bad, right?

603
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:36,780
Speaker 1: Yep computers can get it right like a hundred percent of the time.

604
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,332
Speaker 1: They just don't fully look at the tennis thing.

605
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:42,888
Speaker 0: The tennis thing always gets it right The eagle whatever.

606
00:43:42,908 --> 00:43:43,734
Speaker 0: I don't know what they call it.

607
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:43,976
Speaker 0: Yep.

608
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:47,170
Speaker 1: So yeah, I met a moment geek knives book club book tale again.

609
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,973
Speaker 1: Gee, we're reading it.

610
00:43:48,656 --> 00:43:49,318
Speaker 0: Uh, check this out.

611
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:49,760
Speaker 0: Check this out.

612
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,192
Speaker 0: I got the new that I guess the light is gonna make it see count.

613
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:54,136
Speaker 0: There you go.

614
00:43:54,156 --> 00:43:55,360
Speaker 1: No, that's the new paper wide.

615
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got the new.

616
00:43:56,827 --> 00:43:59,300
Speaker 0: you know, cuz I had a Kindle, you know way back in the day.

617
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,598
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck happened to it.

618
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I've been using the Kindle app on my phone when I was on the train.

619
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:08,320
Speaker 0: But you know how to read on your phone if you don't have to know and I'm not not on the train anymore.

620
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,960
Speaker 0: So I was using the Kindle app on my iPad, but I have a giant iPad and as a keyboard attached to it.

621
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:18,480
Speaker 0: So like reading laying down was holding this heavy iPad up in the air for an extended Genji.

622
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,088
Speaker 0: You're reading for an extended period not a short period.

623
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:24,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like and also, you know the beach, right?

624
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,979
Speaker 0: So I would have bought the paper white earlier and it taken it to the beach this year.

625
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,088
Speaker 0: But I realized wait a minute.

626
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:36,411
Speaker 0: The Kindle paper white is like a several year old device That's got to be getting updated soon, right and sure enough it was.

627
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:41,409
Speaker 0: so yeah this I literally got this Yesterday and it was released yesterday.

628
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,677
Speaker 0: So hopefully this will last me many years.

629
00:44:43,737 --> 00:44:44,540
Speaker 0: go to many beaches.

630
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:46,978
Speaker 0: That way I don't take my iPad to the beach.

631
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:54,536
Speaker 0: So, yeah, because I guess that will help me I already read some Genji.

632
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:58,091
Speaker 0: just cuz you know, you're a nerd You're excited to use your new technological do dead.

633
00:44:58,131 --> 00:44:59,859
Speaker 1: Haha, so we'll get ready to do it.

634
00:45:00,842 --> 00:45:04,293
Speaker 1: Well, really briefly talk but assume we're gonna spoil some doing stuff.

635
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:09,119
Speaker 0: so if you've never did a book club episode on dune the book.

636
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,452
Speaker 0: So if you haven't read doing the book you could.

637
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:13,997
Speaker 0: if you have you can go listen to that episode.

638
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:21,060
Speaker 0: if you haven't Yep, read the book right or I guess you could just watch this movie and listen to this episode.

639
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:23,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would not say it's bad.

640
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:31,724
Speaker 1: Like if you watch this movie It's pretty good at like conveying what the book conveys Like it's.

641
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:33,451
Speaker 1: you could do fine by just watching.

642
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:38,430
Speaker 0: but we're gonna spoil, you know, I guess book and movie But they're almost the same so it's not really any different.

643
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:43,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is having read the book Nothing in the movie was out of place, right?

644
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:45,517
Speaker 0: It's like I was effectively a hundred percent spoiled on it.

645
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:51,295
Speaker 0: Yep, so But yeah, we're gonna spoil the book and movie of do and there's no point.

646
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:52,260
Speaker 0: it's a really old book.

647
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:52,984
Speaker 0: It's older than me.

648
00:45:53,044 --> 00:45:54,512
Speaker 0: I think you're as old as me at least.

649
00:45:54,612 --> 00:46:03,712
Speaker 1: so so all over the main I'll say before we will just start spoiling stuff about Duncan Idaho is that the movie is really good and you should see it.

650
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,099
Speaker 0: I just watched an HBO max.

651
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,709
Speaker 1: No problem Yep, it just worked.

652
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,260
Speaker 1: It was perfectly fine quality.

653
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:18,627
Speaker 1: My sole complaint was that the dialogue was in many scenes a little bit hard to hear because there was way Low in the mix compared.

654
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:19,832
Speaker 0: Well, that's because right.

655
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:21,278
Speaker 0: so that's a common problem.

656
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:22,402
Speaker 0: I've noticed I don't.

657
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:26,439
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'd love to talk to like a Hollywood audio expert to find the reason for this.

658
00:46:26,944 --> 00:46:38,186
Speaker 0: But I've noticed this pattern Pretty much like especially with like blu-ray rips or pretty much anything that has like a surround Hollywood movie theater mix.

659
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:46,107
Speaker 0: if you take that mix and just play it in your home without remixing it somehow It's like even on sometimes.

660
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:56,347
Speaker 0: they'll have a 5.1 surround system and like the voices will be on the center channel where they belong but they'll just be so much quieter than the explosions and the music and the Everything else.

661
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,480
Speaker 0: and it's like in the movie theater.

662
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:09,300
Speaker 0: I guess that's not a problem because there's a ton of speakers behind the screen But for some reason at home It becomes a problem and I'd love for someone who knows a lot about that to explain what the deal is.

663
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,800
Speaker 0: But I've noticed that a lot for the past 20 years.

664
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,120
Speaker 1: I've also noticed it more with the so-called prestige movies than with like every other regular old movie.

665
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:30,959
Speaker 0: Just not any yeah, but it's like even if I take like a Star Wars, you know Obviously not the ones that I'm watching which are you know, the the special?

666
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,810
Speaker 0: Despecialized editions, but if you get a Star Wars bureh, it's like.

667
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:46,047
Speaker 0: it's like actually the you know, the voice is too quiet Yep, but it's visually stunning like the acting is great the story is really stunning But the colors are.

668
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:48,040
Speaker 0: it's like it's either brown or gray.

669
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,832
Speaker 1: I think that works though considering what's going on.

670
00:47:52,254 --> 00:47:54,220
Speaker 1: And also it is when you get shots of Caledon.

671
00:47:54,542 --> 00:48:01,230
Speaker 1: It's very it's more colorful, but then we don't go back barely Barely, yeah, it's an austere future.

672
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:02,214
Speaker 0: It's not brown.

673
00:48:02,274 --> 00:48:03,138
Speaker 0: So it's a contrast.

674
00:48:03,158 --> 00:48:07,885
Speaker 0: Yeah you know just like the the Harkonnen plan it's black.

675
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:11,097
Speaker 0: Well, it's like very it's not.

676
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:13,770
Speaker 0: it's never multiple colors at once.

677
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,094
Speaker 1: if you haven't read the book or Seen the movie stop listening cuz we're gonna spoil a bunch of stuff.

678
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:26,820
Speaker 1: and if you only saw the movie Also, we're gonna spoil some stuff because the the movie stops kind of in the middle of the book right before things get weird.

679
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:27,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, they broke.

680
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:28,047
Speaker 0: they broke.

681
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,360
Speaker 0: So that's something they broken in two parts, right?

682
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:37,244
Speaker 0: That's a common complaint nerds have when a nerdy book gets turned into a movie is all the stuff that gets cut out because books Are fucking long.

683
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:39,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, I made a movie that had everything in the book.

684
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:40,580
Speaker 0: It would be forever.

685
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:45,360
Speaker 0: You'd be in the theater for 10 hours, which I'm fine with but not everyone is right.

686
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,160
Speaker 0: So then what they did in this case rather than cut things they did cut a lot.

687
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:55,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they didn't cut nothing but they didn't cut anything that was that significant.

688
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:57,767
Speaker 1: They cut the concept of men tats.

689
00:48:57,807 --> 00:49:02,421
Speaker 1: they showed it and they implied what it was, but they didn't like explain it at all That's your.

690
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:03,224
Speaker 0: but yeah, it wasn't isn't?

691
00:49:03,264 --> 00:49:05,914
Speaker 0: Hawaii's the mentat right and DeVry.

692
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:08,930
Speaker 0: I Guess DeVry didn't appear did they?

693
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, they died right away anyway.

694
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,236
Speaker 0: Hey What was I saying?

695
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,325
Speaker 1: well, yeah, whatever.

696
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:24,400
Speaker 1: so when you may when you adapt something like this, you can either cut a ton out or Make like split it up and make multiple movies.

697
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,042
Speaker 1: You can go too far.

698
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:29,838
Speaker 1: movies like the hobbit stuff where they they made way too many hours of movie.

699
00:49:29,858 --> 00:49:31,224
Speaker 1: for how long that book Actually is?

700
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:33,720
Speaker 0: well the hobbit also changed way too much stuff.

701
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:39,500
Speaker 1: It was too significant a change and the hobbit got like 80% through the book at the end of its first movie.

702
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:42,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't even watch past the first time.

703
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:43,773
Speaker 1: I watched the second one.

704
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:45,780
Speaker 1: it was bad and I didn't watch anything after that.

705
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:46,978
Speaker 1: I never even saw smog.

706
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:52,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, anyway, so there's doing movie that just came out.

707
00:49:52,295 --> 00:49:57,755
Speaker 0: So first of all, I Don't think it's like a masterpiece five-star movie.

708
00:49:57,816 --> 00:50:02,337
Speaker 0: It's not like fucking Seven samurai or some, you know rear window or some shit, right?

709
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:02,920
Speaker 0: It's not like.

710
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:11,291
Speaker 0: but in terms of take a nerdy book and turned it into a movie I Don't know how you can do better.

711
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:14,762
Speaker 1: No, it didn't Do.

712
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:19,074
Speaker 1: the casting was great if like Emily has not read the book.

713
00:50:19,535 --> 00:50:20,197
Speaker 1: I've read the book.

714
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:21,220
Speaker 1: We watched it together.

715
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:30,172
Speaker 1: We both reacted to it about the same level because knowing things Makes some like minor elements pop more or be interesting.

716
00:50:30,453 --> 00:50:33,703
Speaker 1: but not knowing things in no way takes away From the story.

717
00:50:33,723 --> 00:50:34,385
Speaker 1: that's being told.

718
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,472
Speaker 0: and in fact the movie spoilers.

719
00:50:36,653 --> 00:50:38,740
Speaker 0: spoilers didn't spoil didn't they huh?

720
00:50:39,181 --> 00:50:40,626
Speaker 0: Well, that's a thing I guess.

721
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:47,407
Speaker 1: well now because in this case I was mostly I go to a movie like this Primarily knowing what's happening.

722
00:50:47,488 --> 00:50:48,170
Speaker 1: I'm just curious.

723
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:49,534
Speaker 1: How are they gonna do it?

724
00:50:49,936 --> 00:50:51,200
Speaker 1: How are they gonna portray this?

725
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,207
Speaker 1: What is this mentat gonna act like?

726
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:54,473
Speaker 1: Oh, they did an eye thing.

727
00:50:54,513 --> 00:50:55,075
Speaker 1: That's cool.

728
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,910
Speaker 1: I Do like the eye thing.

729
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:02,368
Speaker 1: they do okay, but The visual storytelling is really good.

730
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:09,450
Speaker 1: But really it's that it actually Tells you what's happening much more directly than the book does.

731
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,817
Speaker 1: in that the book like.

732
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:15,239
Speaker 1: if you read it closely It's obvious what the Emperor's plan is.

733
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:20,160
Speaker 1: But a lot of people like don't get it and it was surprising at the end of the book.

734
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:22,528
Speaker 0: The book is never saying like the.

735
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:23,691
Speaker 0: you know, the book is like.

736
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,340
Speaker 0: alright, you know, something's happening.

737
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:31,820
Speaker 0: Why you know, why is the the Emperor removed telling the Harkonnens to leave the spice?

738
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:35,651
Speaker 0: And bring you know, the the the Atreides in.

739
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:36,674
Speaker 0: why are they doing that?

740
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:38,820
Speaker 1: wait, why are there Sardar car there?

741
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,583
Speaker 1: That's weird.

742
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:41,913
Speaker 1: I thought the Emperor is on the Atreides right?

743
00:51:42,094 --> 00:51:49,774
Speaker 0: Whereas this one is like Yes The Emperor is doing it because he fears Atreides is getting too powerful.

744
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:52,040
Speaker 0: more patent might overtake the Emperor.

745
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,479
Speaker 0: Therefore he is doing this to kill off the Atreides in a way that they can get away with it.

746
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:02,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just spell it out for you, but they're also spoon it right in.

747
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:14,840
Speaker 1: It's also doing a really good job of spelling out the Chekhov's things that are critical to the second movie Like for example, they bring up in the movie multiple times that this there's no satellites around Dune.

748
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:18,529
Speaker 1: Well now around Dune around Arrakis - uh.

749
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:28,820
Speaker 1: But they make it clear that that is why the Emperor was able to send the Sardar car in there Because there'd be no record of it because everyone who saw them would be dead.

750
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:33,628
Speaker 1: But as you know if you've read the book the fact that there's no satellites.

751
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:41,639
Speaker 1: there is a big part of what the Fremen are up to and Also a big part of what the Emperor's up to and also a big part of how the entire plot evolves in the end.

752
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:48,100
Speaker 0: Yep But yeah, it's like, you know, I'm sure if you do I only read the book once when we did the book club.

753
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,252
Speaker 0: Yeah, I attempted to read it in my youth and wasn't a fan then.

754
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:53,360
Speaker 0: and um, I mean, I guess it's okay.

755
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,292
Speaker 0: now I'm not like a huge Dune fan.

756
00:52:55,333 --> 00:53:01,080
Speaker 1: I like that book a lot But I like the prince of nothing books a lot - it's about on that level of like how much I like.

757
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,992
Speaker 0: There's nothing way more than we're doing.

758
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:07,020
Speaker 1: I guess the thing about dude The only problem with people I was about to say the prison nothing.

759
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,914
Speaker 1: The problem is the later books aren't quite as good.

760
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:11,943
Speaker 0: but dude Yeah, well, I didn't.

761
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:13,971
Speaker 0: I only ever read one Dune book.

762
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:15,215
Speaker 1: I also only ever read one.

763
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:19,083
Speaker 0: So Was it.

764
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:24,927
Speaker 0: but you know dude, I guess even if I'm not like a huge fan of it, right It's still a bunch of fun, right?

765
00:53:24,987 --> 00:53:27,778
Speaker 0: Cuz you got all these proper nouns you get worms, right?

766
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:30,548
Speaker 0: Yeah It's it's just fun to do.

767
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:31,493
Speaker 0: doing stuff is fun.

768
00:53:31,513 --> 00:53:32,699
Speaker 0: That's why there's so many doing me up.

769
00:53:33,162 --> 00:53:38,284
Speaker 1: also, I gotta say the casting and the acting was like Absolutely.

770
00:53:38,365 --> 00:53:38,709
Speaker 1: Perfect.

771
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:42,250
Speaker 1: They made Duncan, Idaho So absolutely likable.

772
00:53:42,551 --> 00:53:44,660
Speaker 1: when he shows up you're like that guy's awesome.

773
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:48,180
Speaker 1: And then when he dies, you're like what the fuck you killed my favorite character right away.

774
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:49,979
Speaker 0: I knew he was gonna die though because I read the book.

775
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:57,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's funny because everyone who has not seen Dune or red Dune like even those people have heard of Duncan Idaho because that name's ridiculous.

776
00:53:58,379 --> 00:54:05,320
Speaker 1: and Yeah, Duncan, Idaho is the best character because he does come back and like almost every Dune book, right?

777
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:05,764
Speaker 0: It's like that's.

778
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:11,635
Speaker 0: I haven't read any other Dune book But I know that there's like clones of Duncan, Idaho and shit something like that.

779
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:19,040
Speaker 0: There's something along those lines In Idaho and bringing him back because even in universe too cool and fun and awesome.

780
00:54:19,361 --> 00:54:25,912
Speaker 1: Yep, even in universe people are like, oh, yeah that Duncan, Idaho gotta get me some of that Give me give me a done bring me another.

781
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:27,199
Speaker 1: I broke mine.

782
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:38,071
Speaker 1: So, yeah, but people watching this movie who don't know anything about Dune are like, oh that's Duncan, Idaho I see why everyone and then he's dead and they're like, what the fuck?

783
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:42,785
Speaker 1: He's not coming back in the second movie guys He's gone right.

784
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:51,100
Speaker 0: so for me the a big complaint I have with a lot of things, right I make this complaint actually a lot about all those superhero movies.

785
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,834
Speaker 0: Right because like you read like a superhero comic and there's this surface level story.

786
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:57,780
Speaker 0: Let's say x-men for example, right?

787
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:10,285
Speaker 0: There's like a surface level story in x-men of oh, yeah There's bad magneto and he's gonna do something bad and these guys fight and most people will go see the movie and though That's what they'll take away from it.

788
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:14,660
Speaker 0: Right good guys bad guys fighting but x-men has a deeper story.

789
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:24,900
Speaker 0: Sometimes that deeper story is or deeper message will be you know, yeah Genocide against you know, this minority mutant people discrimination, etc.

790
00:55:25,744 --> 00:55:28,419
Speaker 0: But there'll be even more layers to that.

791
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:33,978
Speaker 0: You know, like I think I've made the Claremont Twitter account a recent thing of the day, right?

792
00:55:34,018 --> 00:55:39,940
Speaker 0: You can go They get pretty deep in the comics but then and there are movies that go deep.

793
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:43,971
Speaker 0: But the movies based on the written material don't go.

794
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:46,017
Speaker 0: they remove the depth right.

795
00:55:46,338 --> 00:55:56,369
Speaker 0: a lot of times you know, you'll see you know a Movie based on a book and the movie is just the shallow part and they cut out the deep part Because it's a Hollywood blockbuster.

796
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:58,720
Speaker 0: So this one that is what I expected.

797
00:55:59,344 --> 00:56:06,936
Speaker 0: So in Dune right the big You know from my reading of Dune and I definitely said this in the episode we did on the book.

798
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:07,859
Speaker 1: I'll link to it.

799
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:16,040
Speaker 0: yeah, the The deep parts of Dune the most the most significant part is the ecological message, right?

800
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,395
Speaker 0: It's mostly a story about the ecology of the planet.

801
00:56:19,535 --> 00:56:24,259
Speaker 0: right the spice You know is some kind of worm jizz or some shit like that, right?

802
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:32,900
Speaker 1: Water the the fact that the Lifestyle they live there is almost a form of ecological terrorism by the colonial powers.

803
00:56:33,402 --> 00:56:34,806
Speaker 1: It could have been a paradise planet.

804
00:56:35,147 --> 00:56:39,400
Speaker 1: it by all rights should be a paradise planet, right the Fremen, right?

805
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:44,020
Speaker 0: They they you know, they don't try to change the planet, right?

806
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,180
Speaker 0: They live in harmony with their environment, right?

807
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:55,225
Speaker 0: Instead of coming in and messing it up and stealing and pillaging right that whole thing going on and I'm like Well, that's the deep message.

808
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,975
Speaker 0: I guess this movie is gonna cut that part out and you know what.

809
00:56:58,356 --> 00:56:59,460
Speaker 0: they fucking didn't cut it out.

810
00:56:59,540 --> 00:56:59,821
Speaker 0: They left.

811
00:56:59,841 --> 00:57:01,027
Speaker 0: how long did they not cut it out?

812
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:04,040
Speaker 1: It's driving straight at it at lights.

813
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, as as the movie goes on they zoom in on it and I'm like they're more.

814
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:11,404
Speaker 0: it's like it's there and they keep you Know they don't let it go.

815
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:14,980
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, it's this is gonna be a focused important thing.

816
00:57:15,361 --> 00:57:19,833
Speaker 0: We're not letting go of that message and I was like, oh golf clap golf clap.

817
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:20,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll go.

818
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:22,079
Speaker 0: also keep that shit.

819
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:27,674
Speaker 1: Liat Keynes or kinds like the the the imperial judge of whatever like.

820
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,799
Speaker 1: they're not, you know, the whole plot around that character.

821
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:48,738
Speaker 1: Yeah the casting for that character like changing it from a man to a woman getting the perfect actress to play that character and That character really really driving home the ecological message and then going out in a perfect blaze of glory Like that was just such a great set of scenes right there.

822
00:57:49,501 --> 00:57:59,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, now there were some changes but none of those changes were changes that were like Significant in terms of making dune not dune anymore, right?

823
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,812
Speaker 1: They left out like a bunch of extra desert scenes that didn't matter.

824
00:58:02,873 --> 00:58:04,960
Speaker 1: We're like Jessica gets buried in some sand.

825
00:58:05,401 --> 00:58:11,800
Speaker 1: They left out all the like dinner parties and like local political intrigue that led up to the attack.

826
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,115
Speaker 1: The movie starts Harkonnen attack like basically two days later.

827
00:58:15,135 --> 00:58:21,679
Speaker 0: Yep What they a good example of a positive change they made right is in the book.

828
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:28,218
Speaker 0: You know The Baron Harkonnen is a sort of a fat phobia thing going on there.

829
00:58:28,278 --> 00:58:33,112
Speaker 0: body shaming I mean, he's still large and I guess they didn't.

830
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:36,022
Speaker 0: but it's like, you know, I don't know They did.

831
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,392
Speaker 1: they made it like you look at his neck.

832
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:43,433
Speaker 1: They made him more Deformed and less just a fat person like he was often portrayed.

833
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's still there.

834
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:51,660
Speaker 0: But they also in the book Baron Harkonnen was like a gay pedophile, right?

835
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,074
Speaker 0: So it was homophobic yeah and such and that aspect completely removed.

836
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:57,358
Speaker 0: which is that right?

837
00:58:57,559 --> 00:58:58,950
Speaker 0: good That was.

838
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,020
Speaker 0: that's unnecessary, right?

839
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,337
Speaker 0: We don't need the bad guy to be the.

840
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:06,340
Speaker 0: you know You make the only gay person a pedophile and also the big villain.

841
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:13,600
Speaker 0: It's like what message you sending there, right Frank Herbert was sending that message, but we don't need to spend that message anymore We'll just get that one out of there.

842
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:18,175
Speaker 0: It does not harm the story in any way.

843
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:19,580
Speaker 0: He's still the bad guy, right?

844
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,671
Speaker 0: You know, he's the bad guy because he's in this place.

845
00:59:22,691 --> 00:59:25,059
Speaker 0: That's all black and he's killing people.

846
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:40,986
Speaker 1: The way they make him float is hyper Menacing in a very Darth Vader way and I appreciate much much better that scene where he just like floats up over the table Was perfect.

847
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:42,391
Speaker 1: It's like I got a little movie.

848
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:44,480
Speaker 0: way of floating was was much not as good.

849
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:47,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, or wait or when he comes out of his vat.

850
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,819
Speaker 1: That was a lot like when the shell opens around Darth Vader when the Admiral comes in to report to him

851
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:59,776
Speaker 0: All right, and then you know, he's actually kind of like a scary dangerous, dude Which you see in the scene where the the poison gas comes out of the tooth, right?

852
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:00,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, you know.

853
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,548
Speaker 0: So he's day.

854
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:02,900
Speaker 0: he's dangerous and capable.

855
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,240
Speaker 0: He's not just like a you know, an evil blob like a crang the brain from Ninja Turtles or something.

856
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,185
Speaker 1: But that was another good change of.

857
01:00:10,486 --> 01:00:22,179
Speaker 1: they didn't leave in the fullness of the plot around the doctor and the conditioning and like the the entire convoluted plot that led up to the assassination attempt on the Baron the all they just distilled it down to.

858
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,259
Speaker 1: Dude knows his wife is dead.

859
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:29,620
Speaker 1: He's pertaining to go along with the Baron and betray them and he's actually betraying a trade ease.

860
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:33,274
Speaker 1: But he's actually doing all of it to assassinate the bear.

861
01:00:33,294 --> 01:00:34,920
Speaker 1: They just distills it down to that essence.

862
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:43,894
Speaker 1: It doesn't get into all those other details that frankly weren't that relevant to the story And that and that aspect still like resonated really well.

863
01:00:43,914 --> 01:00:44,738
Speaker 1: those scenes were great.

864
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:50,380
Speaker 0: Hey, what else is there to say about this movie?

865
01:00:50,641 --> 01:00:51,163
Speaker 0: the whole time?

866
01:00:51,183 --> 01:00:53,230
Speaker 0: I was watching the movie because I've read the book.

867
01:00:53,450 --> 01:01:03,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was thinking about the final scene of the book, which is You know sort of a big at the end of the book is like this big climax of awesomeness, right?

868
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,890
Speaker 0: And I know exactly what happens in that scene.

869
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:10,287
Speaker 0: Hopefully they don't change it because that would be very.

870
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:10,710
Speaker 0: you know.

871
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,039
Speaker 1: They did in the very in the very beginning when they come in.

872
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:14,143
Speaker 1: He's like, what's that?

873
01:01:14,244 --> 01:01:15,690
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the shield wall.

874
01:01:16,234 --> 01:01:22,457
Speaker 0: It protects the entire city okay, but So hopefully they don't change the ending.

875
01:01:22,618 --> 01:01:32,944
Speaker 0: but while I was watching it it made me Excited right, you know had positive anticipation for like ooh The final scene of this book is awesome.

876
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:37,790
Speaker 0: I Want to see that final scene at the end of this movie, right?

877
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:38,071
Speaker 0: I got.

878
01:01:38,192 --> 01:01:41,189
Speaker 0: I want to see it play out on the screen even though I know what happens.

879
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,054
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

880
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:45,050
Speaker 0: So which means I was enjoying what I was watching.

881
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,206
Speaker 0: Simple as that, right?

882
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,175
Speaker 1: The I guess.

883
01:01:49,196 --> 01:02:02,374
Speaker 1: the other thing I can I can point out is that one thing I like is a big theme in the book like the secondary theme other than the ecology and also other than the whole like Transhumanist.

884
01:02:02,494 --> 01:02:05,530
Speaker 1: what are the Bene Gesserit everyone else actually up to with the breeding programs?

885
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,789
Speaker 1: It did a good job of like weaving that in without focusing on it.

886
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:15,710
Speaker 1: But I appreciate a big part of the book was the fact that the religion of the Fremen was fake.

887
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:22,249
Speaker 1: It's a generic religion that the Bene Gesserit seed all throughout the galaxy or the universe.

888
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:36,410
Speaker 1: even Just in case a Bene Gesserit ever gets like stuck on a planet or has a problem They can like figure out what aspects of that core religion Like how it got integrated in local society and then use the local superstitions and religion to get their way.

889
01:02:37,355 --> 01:02:41,529
Speaker 1: It very subtly Does that in the movie when you see Jessica like?

890
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:53,446
Speaker 1: Talking to the Fremen and when they're like out for the first time in the desert you see the her and Paul sort of interact until they figure out like how much the religion is there and then they just dive into it.

891
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:59,455
Speaker 1: and I like how you see Them like bickering with each other with their sign language the whole time Like.

892
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:17,567
Speaker 1: I thought it did that well and it Didn't lose the idea that the Bene Gesserit planted the religion in the first place while also showing that Maybe the religion was planted there for more than one reason or maybe no one anticipated that Paul might Use it more than they expected to like that

893
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:20,073
Speaker 0: whole element Right.

894
01:03:20,094 --> 01:03:33,433
Speaker 0: so the reason the religion is planted right it sort of depends the level of the perspective of how much spice and how much into the future a Person sees right.

895
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:34,356
Speaker 0: so it's all zero.

896
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:36,524
Speaker 0: You can't see into the future at all.

897
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:38,470
Speaker 0: It looks like a legitimate religion.

898
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,696
Speaker 0: That's what they believe right now.

899
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:42,290
Speaker 0: the next level right like Bene Gesserit level.

900
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:43,476
Speaker 0: You know they can.

901
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:45,225
Speaker 0: it's like okay like what you said.

902
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:46,109
Speaker 0: they plan it there.

903
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:53,030
Speaker 0: You know in case they might need it in the future and they're planning for the long haul, but it's like step three.

904
01:03:53,411 --> 01:03:56,490
Speaker 0: Ha you know Bene Gesserit right full plan.

905
01:03:56,651 --> 01:04:05,106
Speaker 0: It's like ah we knew that exactly this would happen and therefore we plant this seed Thousands of years ago in the Fremen people just for this moment.

906
01:04:05,146 --> 01:04:06,150
Speaker 0: We know it's gonna happen.

907
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:11,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was all set in advance and now the dominoes are falling right.

908
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:13,775
Speaker 1: finally But then you go even further.

909
01:04:13,795 --> 01:04:19,810
Speaker 1: Oh, no, maybe Paul spice too much and saw beyond what you saw and now it's not your plan anymore.

910
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:21,483
Speaker 0: The K came before.

911
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:25,538
Speaker 0: yeah Darkness Spice me up.

912
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:29,103
Speaker 0: So the worm right.

913
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:29,949
Speaker 0: the thing with the worm.

914
01:04:31,552 --> 01:04:43,229
Speaker 0: On the one hand I kind of you know The worm is still a pretty good design for the scenes in the movie because there's a lot of scenes like you know The worm comes straight up and it becomes like a big hole sort of like the Sarlacc.

915
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:51,754
Speaker 0: So visually for the scenes they were going for in the movie the design of the worm works, but just personally aesthetically I like the worm.

916
01:04:51,794 --> 01:04:52,518
Speaker 0: that's like the head.

917
01:04:52,558 --> 01:04:54,710
Speaker 0: the tip is split into three flaps.

918
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:57,462
Speaker 0: You know that style that you've seen a lot of illustrations.

919
01:04:57,884 --> 01:04:59,229
Speaker 1: I'm pretty a little it on that piece.

920
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:03,990
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, it's really minor right, but I just like the three flap worm, right?

921
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:16,505
Speaker 0: But in addition to that in the book from what I remember is Sort of like when they make Paul ride the worm spoilers for part two.

922
01:05:16,525 --> 01:05:26,557
Speaker 0: Yeah When Paul rides the worm like that's I didn't if there was any instance of anyone riding a worm Before then in the book.

923
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,042
Speaker 0: I didn't see it.

924
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:29,247
Speaker 0: I must have missed it.

925
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:40,363
Speaker 0: So When Paul rides the worm, it's sort of like simultaneously like you can ride a worm Right, you're getting hit with both of those at once whereas in this book and in this movie.

926
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:53,078
Speaker 0: There's a scene where Kinds right holds up the two hooks and I'm ready to ride the worm and then right at the end of the movie They show you in the distance someone riding a worm.

927
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:56,027
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, someone can ride a worm.

928
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,417
Speaker 0: now before Paul rides a worm.

929
01:05:58,518 --> 01:05:58,720
Speaker 1: Yep.

930
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:05,270
Speaker 0: I Just at least I don't know if that was different because a I don't remember the book or B It was different from the book.

931
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:14,670
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't remember exactly how that scene went down But I love when Lee but it's just right pounding the sand with her fist to make sure the Sardar cargo down with her.

932
01:06:15,593 --> 01:06:19,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, it's a right because riding a worm is pretty significant.

933
01:06:20,071 --> 01:06:24,890
Speaker 1: So in terms of I like how the movie did not explain how the shields work at all.

934
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:33,814
Speaker 1: But no the way they were visually portrayed makes it extremely clear the important parts about those shields except for the laser gun thing Which didn't come up yet.

935
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:41,610
Speaker 0: I mean, that's really most of what making the movie is Right, you know it since they didn't really change too much plot.

936
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:45,743
Speaker 0: Most of the decisions and the artwork of making this movie was okay.

937
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:48,050
Speaker 0: Here's what happened, right?

938
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,694
Speaker 0: Here's the here's the world.

939
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:52,483
Speaker 0: But what does it actually look like?

940
01:06:52,563 --> 01:06:54,269
Speaker 0: All we have is a description of words.

941
01:06:55,474 --> 01:07:03,270
Speaker 0: That description isn't like some rock-solid Like description where you could go to a CNC mill and create the world of dune, right?

942
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:08,650
Speaker 1: Or you've got a long dialogue of someone explaining this is how a shield works and you don't want to do that in a movie

943
01:07:09,274 --> 01:07:22,910
Speaker 0: Right, you need to look at those words and be like, okay They just described what this room looks like and so you imagine the room in your head and now you need to get you Know the people who make the set the people who make the props the actors the costume people the cameras, right?

944
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:37,145
Speaker 0: this the shots everything to Make a vision image a 2d image that matches that text Right, and then since someone watching it, you know understands the story as if they were reading it.

945
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,394
Speaker 0: and they accomplished that very Very well, right.

946
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:44,630
Speaker 0: nothing that you saw on screen like didn't match it.

947
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,474
Speaker 0: you know, there's not like.

948
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,308
Speaker 0: oh those those ships don't look like that.

949
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:52,069
Speaker 0: or You know, that's not what a shield a shield should look like this.

950
01:07:52,451 --> 01:08:08,528
Speaker 1: It's like but like the way it like turns red when something gets too close to the skin and how it's something moving slow like it Conveyed what was paragraphs and paragraphs of explanation into the book Visually simply and it worked and not not with any incorrectness.

951
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:22,344
Speaker 1: Yep I also do like the casting of Paul because he's basically just a mumbly teen Who is very rapidly outstripping his mother's powers, and I think he's just he's playing it really well Like he's just a mumbly angsty teen.

952
01:08:22,363 --> 01:08:27,361
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, they casted everyone really well, I think you dirty is grating the book.

953
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:29,125
Speaker 1: is there anything I don't like?

954
01:08:29,586 --> 01:08:30,929
Speaker 1: no not one.

955
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:33,120
Speaker 0: but they could have.

956
01:08:33,381 --> 01:08:43,020
Speaker 0: uh You know, it's like they could have gone harder right in terms of like, you know, they could have made a treatise not white You know, I mean, yeah, they could have made.

957
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:45,229
Speaker 0: you could have made Paul a woman, right?

958
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,852
Speaker 0: Okay.

959
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:46,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could have flipped.

960
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:56,670
Speaker 0: you could have flipped it like Bene Gesserit or dudes every height and Everyone else is ladies or whatever, you know, at least I'm glad with Lea They made that was a really good casting choice at a really good character.

961
01:08:57,211 --> 01:09:04,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were some issues though in terms of a lot of those characters that were not the white people right were killed.

962
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:15,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you get your the doctor, you know kinds all these You know choices to go with not white people and those people all sort of died.

963
01:09:15,183 --> 01:09:19,513
Speaker 1: better have more non-white people in book two Don't write Right.

964
01:09:19,553 --> 01:09:22,140
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, they did more than nothing.

965
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:23,084
Speaker 1: I don't know.

966
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:24,970
Speaker 1: I don't think we know who's playing the Emperor yet.

967
01:09:26,532 --> 01:09:30,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do suspect the Emperor might be a black person.

968
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:42,545
Speaker 0: I really hope so especially Considering lead and like the Imperial is based also based on the Imperial stuff that you saw Like during the opening scenes, I think it could be likely.

969
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:43,046
Speaker 1: Yep.

970
01:09:43,348 --> 01:09:43,850
Speaker 1: That's what I hope.

971
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:46,359
Speaker 0: Maybe someone out there already knows who's playing the Emperor.

972
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:47,403
Speaker 0: It's been announced or whatever.

973
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I don't pay that much attention.

974
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:58,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did only just announce that like we assumed part two is coming But they only just now firmly a hundred percent confirmed.

975
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:00,127
Speaker 0: They're gonna make the part two.

976
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:02,865
Speaker 0: So yeah But that wasn't much of a confirmation.

977
01:10:02,925 --> 01:10:04,734
Speaker 0: It's like tell me something I don't know now.

978
01:10:05,356 --> 01:10:17,403
Speaker 1: what I wonder is if they if they make part two and now we've got the first dune book Either they keep going They don't And even so I wanted to keep going red.

979
01:10:17,704 --> 01:10:18,930
Speaker 1: I want to just go crazy.

980
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,162
Speaker 0: So that's the thing is not having read any book beyond book one.

981
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:25,990
Speaker 0: I still know enough to know those books are out of control.

982
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:33,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, bring me some Bennett Alaxu tanks, and I want to see what the fuck these all these They did sort of show you the you know a tank a little bit.

983
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,074
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's not a

984
01:10:34,575 --> 01:10:38,510
Speaker 1: yeah show show me the second like the third dunk in Idaho

985
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:52,398
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like if they keep sticking to those books as they have now even if they keep putting in the same budget, it's like it's gonna fall apart because The books it's like.

986
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,509
Speaker 1: well if you or or here's something that can happen.

987
01:10:55,950 --> 01:11:03,358
Speaker 1: Dune because the P. all the reactions I saw from people who had never read dune or just saw the movie were mostly like Wow, that went really hard.

988
01:11:03,398 --> 01:11:05,005
Speaker 1: That was way more intense than I expected.

989
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:06,190
Speaker 1: Oh, it was all crazy.

990
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:06,832
Speaker 1: Like.

991
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:13,290
Speaker 1: I don't think they realized that maybe 10% of the crazy shit happens in what we've seen so far.

992
01:11:13,671 --> 01:11:21,120
Speaker 1: Like what's gonna happen in the second movie is way off the rails of what most people are expecting if they make more of the movies.

993
01:11:21,502 --> 01:11:29,350
Speaker 1: this might be a way to Like remind people that movies can be fucking weird and still be good and open the door to more me.

994
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,679
Speaker 0: I don't think they have the courage.

995
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,230
Speaker 0: I don't think they have the courage to do that?

996
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:36,825
Speaker 1: I don't either and we won't know until after the second movie is done.

997
01:11:36,966 --> 01:11:37,889
Speaker 1: if they announce a movie.

998
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:46,858
Speaker 1: three I'm gonna be unreasonably excited because I want to see triple-a Blockbuster big-budget big director movie.

999
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,990
Speaker 1: that is as weird as what I know happens in the fourth and fifth dune books.

1000
01:11:51,592 --> 01:11:51,753
Speaker 0: Right.

1001
01:11:51,853 --> 01:12:09,442
Speaker 0: It's like the stuff that I know that happens in those books is way out there stuff That is possibly not great as a story a lot of people say unfilable similar to like the culture books, right, but I You know, even if I agree with that not how.

1002
01:12:09,502 --> 01:12:11,270
Speaker 0: I don't know if I agree with that cuz I've read them.

1003
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:16,666
Speaker 0: But even if I believe them then that means that a I'm not gonna be too interested in those books.

1004
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:23,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, but B Well, I love seeing Fucked up nonsense on movies, right?

1005
01:12:24,023 --> 01:12:30,303
Speaker 1: I look like fucked up Trippy space shit, that's four hours long like hook it into my veins.

1006
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:38,173
Speaker 0: end of Eva end of 2001 Space Odyssey all that I love that kind of like Abstract.

1007
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:44,490
Speaker 1: you want to get Scott to watch the MCU go hard into the weirdest space shit and Scott watch those movies.

1008
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,141
Speaker 0: It's right abstract art.

1009
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:47,449
Speaker 0: It's like a Picasso, right?

1010
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:53,170
Speaker 0: So when you get sort of that abstract nonsense in text form, right?

1011
01:12:53,391 --> 01:13:06,710
Speaker 0: It's not that abstract because you're right but like we read 2001 for the book club Right and that ending was not as abstract as the movies ending even though they were pretty close to each other.

1012
01:13:07,372 --> 01:13:09,839
Speaker 0: Right because the movie doesn't say words.

1013
01:13:09,879 --> 01:13:11,082
Speaker 0: You're just showing you images.

1014
01:13:11,102 --> 01:13:15,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you look at a Picasso and you're like There's no context.

1015
01:13:15,774 --> 01:13:18,321
Speaker 0: There's no what you just you know, it is what you see.

1016
01:13:18,722 --> 01:13:22,837
Speaker 0: so you could take some nonsense book like Oh, yeah, the dude's a worm.

1017
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:23,943
Speaker 0: God see in the future.

1018
01:13:23,963 --> 01:13:25,149
Speaker 0: Who knows what the fuck's happening?

1019
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:32,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you just show that while no one's talking It's like that suddenly makes it good Even if you don't change anything else.

1020
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,138
Speaker 1: if they do make the more books I trust that they would do it the right way.

1021
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:46,250
Speaker 1: because the final thing I would say is that what that were the biggest success of this movie is Not explaining things with words and just trusting the audience to fucking figure it out.

1022
01:13:47,051 --> 01:13:47,192
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

1023
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:48,377
Speaker 0: That is I did.

1024
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,949
Speaker 1: that is the primary strength of this movie.

1025
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:55,405
Speaker 0: So one other one last thing I guess because we're getting I'm hungry.

1026
01:13:55,425 --> 01:13:55,888
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1027
01:13:55,948 --> 01:14:10,090
Speaker 0: Yeah same The a lot of times that you see in series in general what matter the medium Even if they're not super long series is that they'll start off one way and switch things up, right?

1028
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,605
Speaker 0: It's like Adventure Time starts, you know.

1029
01:14:12,726 --> 01:14:22,928
Speaker 0: season one Eh, but then season two onwards is like, you know, what Adventure Time really is Or you know, but in this case Dune is like the flippy floppy.

1030
01:14:23,008 --> 01:14:24,435
Speaker 0: it's like season.

1031
01:14:24,616 --> 01:14:30,810
Speaker 0: the book one is the Good part and then Oh goes later on leave right?

1032
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:32,274
Speaker 0: Where's adventure time, you know?

1033
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:42,250
Speaker 0: or some other things you might tell someone Oh get past the beginning Get past the grinder and suddenly you're gonna care a lot about these characters right where this is, you know?

1034
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:44,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, just read the first one and stop.

1035
01:14:45,303 --> 01:14:46,389
Speaker 0: Yeah opposite deal.

1036
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:51,270
Speaker 0: It's not like they learned as they went on it's they messed up more as they.

1037
01:14:55,593 --> 01:14:58,910
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, hopefully we'll find out what the Emperor's deal is.

1038
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:02,650
Speaker 1: We'll see a second movie someday in the future because they're definitely making it.

1039
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:04,281
Speaker 1: They've announced it like five times.

1040
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:22,330
Speaker 0: that they're making the sequel You know I guess just the final thing is I'm encouraged that someone was able to take an old nerdy book and Translate it into a movie, you know So accurately, but I'm disappointed and that they did it to an already popular old nerdy.

1041
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:25,450
Speaker 1: But we know broken like shattered earth is getting this treatment.

1042
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:26,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

1043
01:15:27,135 --> 01:15:41,568
Speaker 0: But I would love to see a lot more doing it to newer Right, not ultra popular books or even just fucking original stories that don't already exist in a medium You know.

1044
01:15:42,353 --> 01:15:43,818
Speaker 1: But you want you want to get me excited.

1045
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:45,443
Speaker 1: do this for the prince of nothing.

1046
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:47,310
Speaker 1: do it for any culture book.

1047
01:15:47,391 --> 01:15:50,648
Speaker 1: I don't even care which one Those might actually be.

1048
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:54,722
Speaker 0: I'm just saying go find some fantasy novel series.

1049
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:58,835
Speaker 0: That's only read by like, you know Not white not dude.

1050
01:15:58,896 --> 01:16:01,524
Speaker 0: people right and you know do that, right?

1051
01:16:01,604 --> 01:16:02,628
Speaker 0: Don't be going for the.

1052
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:05,040
Speaker 0: you know The popular mega hits always.

1053
01:16:05,141 --> 01:16:06,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least they're.

1054
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:06,348
Speaker 0: you know.

1055
01:16:07,051 --> 01:16:09,078
Speaker 0: Conserve their monies because it's this ain't cheap.

1056
01:16:09,178 --> 01:16:24,570
Speaker 1: but dune has enough cultural cachet to where it might open the door on studios being more willing to take a risk on weird stuff again because Also that ebbs and flows in Hollywood in terms of will they make a weird movie or will they make extremely safe movies?

1057
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:31,778
Speaker 0: It might also maybe teach at least one Hollywood executive if we're lucky a lesson of yeah You don't got to keep fucking changing shit.

1058
01:16:31,798 --> 01:16:33,689
Speaker 0: Just let just follow the book and you'll be alright.

1059
01:16:34,392 --> 01:16:40,730
Speaker 1: But isn't it too weird that that like that the reason like the assassination plot with the Baron like isn't that?

1060
01:16:41,312 --> 01:16:42,055
Speaker 1: No, just throw it in.

1061
01:16:42,337 --> 01:16:42,839
Speaker 1: It'll be fine.

1062
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,330
Speaker 1: You get a cool weird scene where he's hiding on the ceiling and it's awesome.

1063
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:47,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good scene.

1064
01:16:47,258 --> 01:16:54,530
Speaker 1: when they come in like the tasmid suits like oh no Everyone got assassinated and he's up there just barely alive coughing and pissed.

1065
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:57,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know that he is pissed.

1066
01:16:58,142 --> 01:16:58,965
Speaker 1: He's not afraid.

1067
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:00,110
