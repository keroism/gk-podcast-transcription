1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,380
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, March 1st, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,838
Speaker 1: Tonight, Scott reports on the New York Comic-Con and we talk about comic distribution in the United States.

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,538
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,984
Speaker 1: So today, at work, I realized that I know a lot of you might read Dilbert and laugh, "Haha!

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,312
Speaker 1: Dilbert is funny and

6
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:26,597
Speaker 1: fake!".

7
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:32,839
Speaker 1: I'm here to tell you that Dilbert is the 100% truth of what it's like to work in a large company.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:33,909
Speaker 0: Yep.

9
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,840
Speaker 0: I mean, I've been reading Dilbert for a long time.

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,640
Speaker 0: And perhaps as long as Dilbert has existed.

11
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:41,199
Speaker 0: And I always knew all of it was true.

12
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:43,058
Speaker 0: And it, yeah.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:51,224
Speaker 1: It was shown to me in horrid relief today as I sat through an hour-long meeting that accomplished nothing.

14
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:54,739
Speaker 1: while various people babbled, it just, oh my god.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,099
Speaker 1: Tomorrow, I have meetings almost all day.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,780
Speaker 0: This is why I have a job with no meetings.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,299
Speaker 1: I think if it snows tomorrow, I'm not going to work.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,020
Speaker 1: But if I end up going to work, I think I'm going to bring my DS.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,100
Speaker 1: And if anyone says anything, I'll pretend I'm using it to take notes.

20
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:11,698
Speaker 1: I don't know.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,598
Speaker 1: I'll pretend it's a PDA.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,140
Speaker 0: One of my wise old college professors always said, "If you get a job, get a job with no

23
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:18,575
Speaker 0: meetings.".

24
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,919
Speaker 0: And I followed that advice, and I'm glad for it.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,579
Speaker 1: Now, see, a lot of meetings are useful.

26
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:28,140
Speaker 1: Like if I have to meet with a bunch of developers to figure something out about a server, I have a meeting.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,335
Speaker 1: Figure it out.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,720
Speaker 1: If we're going to plan something, we have a meeting.

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,009
Speaker 1: Plan it.

30
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:35,900
Speaker 1: The problem is, any meeting we call is a useful meeting.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,959
Speaker 1: If I call a meeting for, you know, a project I'm working on, we'll get a bunch of stuff done and then we'll go and do the rest of our work.

32
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,136
Speaker 1: The problem is middle management types will call meetings that don't serve any useful purpose.

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:02:00,160
Speaker 1: And in the epitome of Dilbertisms, today, I learned basic, well, it wasn't just today, but it's culminated today, people complain that we're having too many useless meetings.

34
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,937
Speaker 1: And I shit you not, now we're going to have a meeting to determine how to reduce the number of meetings.

35
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:06,759
Speaker 0: Yup.

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,739
Speaker 1: I'm not kidding.

37
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,639
Speaker 1: Everyone thinks this is a good idea.

38
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,460
Speaker 1: Well, everyone in management, everyone in the department knows it's crap, but okay.

39
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:15,738
Speaker 1: I'm done ranting.

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,780
Speaker 0: I know how to reduce the number of meetings.

41
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:18,738
Speaker 0: You ready for this?

42
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:20,178
Speaker 0: No meetings.

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:20,960
Speaker 0: None.

44
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:21,839
Speaker 1: Nah, you need me.

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,268
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

46
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:22,800
Speaker 1: no meetings?

47
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,060
Speaker 1: I can't meet with someone in the hallway?

48
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,580
Speaker 0: No, you know, no, we schedule it.

49
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,238
Speaker 0: Everyone comes to the conference room.

50
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,800
Speaker 1: That's really the only way to talk to a lot of people in a group.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,899
Speaker 1: You have to schedule it.

52
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,587
Speaker 1: Otherwise, someone might not be there and then you can't do whatever you were going to do.

53
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,939
Speaker 1: Meetings are good.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,399
Speaker 1: The problem is bad meetings.

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,460
Speaker 0: I don't even know why you need meetings.

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,800
Speaker 0: Just email back and forth until you come to whatever.

57
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,898
Speaker 0: You know, why do you all have to schedule a time to stop working and go be in the same room as everyone else?

58
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,980
Speaker 1: You've never worked on a large project, have you?

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, we work on, that's all I work on is large projects.

60
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,739
Speaker 1: Um, what do you mean large?

61
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,680
Speaker 0: As in, we need to make this big piece of software for a whole bunch of people.

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:16,660
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm talking about meetings like, you know, we're deploying a T1 and servers on the other side of it and a whole giant thing that includes like ten different departments and then a giant, you know, hundreds of people.

63
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,440
Speaker 0: So the leaders of the ten departments email each other and come to a conclusion?

64
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:24,820
Speaker 1: No, the leaders of the departments just sit down at a meeting and hash it all out and argue it.

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,659
Speaker 1: It's easier that way.

66
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:26,680
Speaker 0: I don't know.

67
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:27,980
Speaker 0: We don't seem to have a problem.

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,680
Speaker 1: You're a freakin' CS major, you sit and write code in a freakin' dungeon.

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a dungeon, it's an empty office in the middle of nowhere.

70
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:36,300
Speaker 1: It's basically a dungeon.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Speaker 0: No, 'cause it's in the same room as the office-y people.

72
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,819
Speaker 0: They annoy me.

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,340
Speaker 1: But anyway, in something you're probably more interested in hearing, uh, you remember my KatsuKan coverage?

74
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,399
Speaker 1: Well, one thing that I talked about was that the video game room was awesome and it was in fact awesome, you know, with the old school games.

75
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:55,519
Speaker 1: But I didn't remember the name of the company that provided the games.

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,779
Speaker 1: It's called Videotopia, and apparently they have a collection of almost 2,000 old school classic games.

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,413
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa, whoa, they have a collection of 2,000 games?

78
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,994
Speaker 1: 2,000 arcade cameras.

79
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,280
Speaker 0: Can you go to Videotopia's warehouse and play them all?

80
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,217
Speaker 1: I don't know.

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,880
Speaker 1: But I do know, 'cause actually, uh, Aaron Ryder, he's actually the guy who did the video game room at KatsuKan, posted in our forums.

82
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,438
Speaker 1: So if you go in the forums, I keep pimpin' the forums, but there's a lot of you who don't go there.

83
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:26,740
Speaker 1: He posted about another event where you can go see all these cabinets and play 'em.

84
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,939
Speaker 1: Apparently they're there every year.

85
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:32,118
Speaker 1: And I'm not gonna say what the event is, so uh, yeah.

86
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:41,580
Speaker 0: So um, also, for anyone who actually likes mad old games like that, you may not know this, but there is a place called Fun Spot.

87
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:47,120
Speaker 0: It's in Weirs Beach, New Hampshire, which is on Lake Winnipesaukee.

88
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:50,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know how to say it, 'cause I've been there like three times.

89
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:51,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, you didn't know how to say Sault Ste.

90
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:51,980
Speaker 1: Marie.

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:52,756
Speaker 0: Whatever.

92
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,180
Speaker 0: This place is perhaps the largest arcade in the United States.

93
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaker 0: They have more pinball machines than like, I don't know, all of Atlantic City.

94
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:08,280
Speaker 0: It's just insane.

95
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,860
Speaker 0: They have like a bowling alley and a mini golf and a go-kart and every old game, every new game, ticket games, everything.

96
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:16,739
Speaker 0: It's insane.

97
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:20,660
Speaker 0: And you should go there sometime in your life for awesome.

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,660
Speaker 1: Or actually, if you happen to live in the Midwest near Sandusky, Ohio.

99
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,440
Speaker 1: Now I'll warn you, I haven't been to Cedar Point in, God, like five years.

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:41,060
Speaker 1: But when I used to go, in Cedar Point, there used to be a giant old-school arcade, and it was pretty much nothing but ass-old, ass-old arcade cabinets.

101
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,760
Speaker 1: Every classic game in the world.

102
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:44,318
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still there.

103
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:46,539
Speaker 1: Anyone who lives there could tell me if it's still there.

104
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:49,360
Speaker 1: If it is still there, I might have to make a trip out to Sandusky.

105
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,620
Speaker 0: There is also a very large arcade at Sesame Place.

106
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,779
Speaker 0: If you ever visit Sesame Place, which is the amusement park of Sesame Street, they have a very large awesome arcade there.

107
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,840
Speaker 0: It's next to the cargo nets, I believe, which are also awesome.

108
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,020
Speaker 1: So anyway, in the news, AMD subpoenaed Skype.

109
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,720
Speaker 0: Right, so the story here is Skype lets you talk to people with VoIP.

110
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:14,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, voice over IP.

111
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:15,720
Speaker 1: VoIP.

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,420
Speaker 0: It's just an internet phone, basically.

113
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:22,199
Speaker 0: Skype has a conferencing feature where you can talk to multiple people at once.

114
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,800
Speaker 1: Alright, so far so good.

115
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:29,280
Speaker 0: By default, for free, without paying any money, you can talk to, I think, five people at once?

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,840
Speaker 1: Yes, five people.

117
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,960
Speaker 1: With Skype 2.0.

118
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,300
Speaker 0: Right, with Skype 2.0, you can talk in a conversation with five people.

119
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:47,019
Speaker 0: If you have an Intel processor, as in a Pentium 4, or one of those core duo things, or an Intel processor, you can talk to ten people at once.

120
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,540
Speaker 1: Ten people, eh?

121
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,179
Speaker 0: And if you have an AMD processor or any other company that's not Intel, you can only talk to five.

122
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:05,999
Speaker 1: Now, they claim that the reason they did this was simply because other chips that aren't Intel don't have the capability of handling ten conversations at the same time.

123
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:10,760
Speaker 0: As someone who knows a whole lot about technology and processors?

124
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:11,976
Speaker 0: Bullshit.

125
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we need a little WAV file to signify bullshit.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:27,300
Speaker 0: There is no technological reason why a non-Intel processor cannot handle the processing necessary for a ten-person internet phone conversation.

127
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,457
Speaker 0: None whatsoever.

128
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:37,319
Speaker 0: The only reason is because, in the code of Skype, they wrote, "If processor equals Intel, then limit equals ten.

129
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:40,176
Speaker 0: If processor equals AMD, limit equals

130
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:40,599
Speaker 0: five.".

131
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,799
Speaker 1: Now, why would they do this, you might ask?

132
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:43,838
Speaker 0: Money money!

133
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:45,034
Speaker 1: Money!

134
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, Intel had a little deal going with them.

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,416
Speaker 1: Little deal.

136
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,692
Speaker 0: So, AMD comes and says, "We got a subpoena,".

137
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:57,800
Speaker 0: and the subpoena says, "Show us your little dealie," so we can see if your little dealie is against the law.

138
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is part of the long, ongoing antitrust case against Intel that it looks more and more like AMD's gonna win.

139
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,148
Speaker 0: Yeah.

140
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:13,960
Speaker 0: Actually, if you don't notice, AMD actually has computers with AMD processors that you can just buy at Staples.

141
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:18,020
Speaker 0: It used to be you couldn't get Linux in the store, you couldn't get AMD in the store.

142
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:22,060
Speaker 0: Now you can just buy an HP computer with an AMD in it just easily.

143
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,740
Speaker 0: So, um, Intel's really, uh, you know.

144
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:27,839
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

145
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,680
Speaker 1: They were the big evil for so long.

146
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:31,539
Speaker 0: You know what's really scary, though?

147
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,799
Speaker 0: Intel's new Core Duo processors are like the hot shit.

148
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:38,558
Speaker 0: Those are the ones that are in all the Macbooks and things, but you can get 'em in PCs, too.

149
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:50,418
Speaker 0: And that's really where--I'm actually thinking trying to find a laptop that has one, 'cause Intel really kicks ass at the laptop processors, AMD not so much because they're not so power-efficient in the AMDs.

150
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,172
Speaker 1: Yeah.

151
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:51,978
Speaker 1: But you know what?

152
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,739
Speaker 1: For desktops, AMD hands down.

153
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause yours is just so cheap, you know, versus the power you get.

154
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,579
Speaker 0: It's just dumb to buy an Intel.

155
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:00,280
Speaker 0: Unless you're loaded.

156
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,957
Speaker 0: I mean, if you win the lottery, I would probably buy Intel's.

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,739
Speaker 0: You know, a whole bunch of 'em.

158
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:06,400
Speaker 0: Eh, maybe.

159
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:25,619
Speaker 0: Recently, there seems to be a lot of websites and various things talking about the lessons World of Warcraft teaches you and, you know, what the world would be like if everyone acted the way they act in MMORPGs.

160
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,420
Speaker 1: Now, we're not fans of World of Warcraft if you haven't gathered that already.

161
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:34,980
Speaker 0: And mainly because of the reasons these people are talking about.

162
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,100
Speaker 0: So, these things tend to amuse me.

163
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,198
Speaker 0: I've been reading all of them.

164
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,639
Speaker 0: But today, there was the best one.

165
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:50,580
Speaker 0: Someone made a video of him and his friends acting out what the world would be like if people acted the way they act in World of Warcraft.

166
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,135
Speaker 1: I believe the quote was, "Get an epic car,

167
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:53,457
Speaker 1: noob.".

168
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:54,338
Speaker 0: Yeah.

169
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:59,140
Speaker 0: And, uh, you know, they pretty much go through each behavior.

170
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,260
Speaker 0: Like they'll be like, the first one is, um, one of them is ganking.

171
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:07,399
Speaker 0: That's, you know, when you kill someone and then right after they come back to life you kill 'em again.

172
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,000
Speaker 1: Alright, now, this is something that has pissed me off about you World of Warcraft people.

173
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,720
Speaker 1: Why do you call that ganking?

174
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,378
Speaker 1: For the longest time, ganking was, I mean, I played MMOs since before some of you kids were born.

175
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,499
Speaker 1: Not to sound like an old man, but god damn it.

176
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:34,100
Speaker 1: Ganking was when you killed someone and then you took their stuff, or when you saw someone and they were dead and you picked up their stuff, or when someone killed something and then you grabbed the thing that the monster dropped.

177
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:44,269
Speaker 0: Apparently, according to Wikipedia, there are many terms, there are many meanings for the word "gank," but it says, "Amongst other definitions, 'gank' is a slang term which refers to 'theft by

178
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:44,693
Speaker 0: force.'".

179
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:51,599
Speaker 0: So, but they, in this video, they refer to ganking as when you kill someone, they come back to life and you kill 'em again.

180
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,659
Speaker 0: So what they do is they have a guy and they beat him up, and then he goes to the hospital, and then as he's walking out of the hospital, they beat him up.

181
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,539
Speaker 1: Yes, Ted, that was the joke.

182
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:00,828
Speaker 1: Yeah.

183
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:09,280
Speaker 0: So it's, they're all like that, and some of them are really, really funny, especially when it involves our friend, um, Leroy.

184
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a bit of a, give it a chance, watch the whole thing before you pass judgment.

185
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a little long and it's not well-paced, but it's still funny.

186
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:17,620
Speaker 1: Yes.

187
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:24,919
Speaker 1: Alright, so my thing was actually sent to me over AIM by Emily while I was at work, being bored, I had some downtime, she sent me this link.

188
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:35,540
Speaker 1: And this link is basically an archive of evidence showing that Superman, you know, as in Superman in the cape flies around superhero, is a giant dick.

189
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,300
Speaker 0: He is a giant dick.

190
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,158
Speaker 1: Well this is proof.

191
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,400
Speaker 1: It shows every dickish thing he's done.

192
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,299
Speaker 1: And I gotta say, he's done some dickish things.

193
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:44,397
Speaker 0: Really?

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:54,760
Speaker 1: Uh, the one thing that's surprising is that he denies water to a person dying of thirst more often than is statistically probable.

195
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:55,565
Speaker 0: Wow.

196
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:07,159
Speaker 1: There are at least three instances of this in this archive, all from different comics by different people at different times, and they're all Superman standing there, and he's got water, and someone's dying, and he won't give it to him.

197
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Speaker 0: I mean, isn't Superman supposed to save people's lives?

198
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,360
Speaker 0: Why is he denying people water in the desert?

199
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,439
Speaker 1: He kills Lois Lane at least eight or nine times.

200
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,340
Speaker 0: Well, you know, she gets out of hand.

201
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,460
Speaker 0: She needs a little slap to get her back in line.

202
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,120
Speaker 1: In addition to this being utterly hilarious, it has all these other sections.

203
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:36,379
Speaker 1: One is just an archive of pictures from old comics where I guess people didn't realize just how homoerotic the images were back then.

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,040
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you can always do better with Batman and Robin than you can with Superman.

205
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,899
Speaker 1: if you're looking for-- Oh, that archive is from any comic, so there is a lot of Batman and Robin now.

206
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:47,100
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, okay.

207
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:49,880
Speaker 1: There's one that Superman's a dick, and there's all these other archives.

208
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,078
Speaker 1: The site is worth going to.

209
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,459
Speaker 1: The only other thing I learned from it was that, one, if ever in a Superman story, Red Kryptonite appears.

210
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:06,880
Speaker 1: That just means they ran out of ideas, 'cause Red Kryptonite, like, splits Superman in two, or just makes crazy crap happen, so they have a plot.

211
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:12,640
Speaker 0: It's really hard to write stories about Superman, because Superman just wins every time.

212
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,133
Speaker 0: It's just bleh.

213
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:20,099
Speaker 0: You have to write a story about something else, and then use Superman as your deus ex machina or something like that.

214
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,079
Speaker 1: That's really the only way to use it.

215
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,359
Speaker 1: It was Superman being controlled by giant bugs, and then everyone has to stop him.

216
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:28,620
Speaker 1: That happened at least twice.

217
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,700
Speaker 0: Why is he so prone to giant bug control?

218
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,275
Speaker 1: You know why?

219
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
Speaker 1: 'Cause he's a giant asshole.

220
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,819
Speaker 1: He's not that smart, either.

221
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:37,799
Speaker 0: No, he really isn't that smart.

222
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:47,160
Speaker 0: You'd think being, you know-- 'cause that's the problem, is all the Superman stories still take place within, like, the first human life length of his life.

223
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:50,416
Speaker 0: If you, like, waited around 'til Superman was, like, 300, he'd be smarter.

224
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,877
Speaker 0: You know?

225
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:52,999
Speaker 1: No, he'd be dead.

226
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,100
Speaker 1: You know, Kryptonite and all.

227
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,440
Speaker 0: I thought he lives-- he's immortal, unless Kryptonite comes around.

228
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'll just Kryptonite him.

229
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,040
Speaker 0: That doesn't seem to work.

230
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,879
Speaker 0: It's happened a bunch of times, and he always seems to win.

231
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:02,857
Speaker 1: You know why?

232
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,500
Speaker 0: I don't think he's gonna fall for it anymore.

233
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,079
Speaker 1: Because the people who write it wouldn't kill him, because that's the end of their revenue stream.

234
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna talk about that in a few minutes.

235
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:15,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, I only brought this site up, 'cause it's been around for a while, but today--.

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,000
Speaker 1: well, usually we use it today to talk about anime and a little bit of comics.

237
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,800
Speaker 1: Today, we're going mad comics and a tiny bit of anime.

238
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:24,712
Speaker 0: Yep.

239
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,700
Speaker 1: So, anyway, on to the comics.

240
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,680
Speaker 0: So, if you did-- first, I wanna talk about the New York Comic-Con.

241
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:33,540
Speaker 0: It was bad.

242
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:36,559
Speaker 1: Uh, uh, debacle comes to mind.

243
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:39,060
Speaker 0: I like to use the-- I like to say debacle.

244
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:40,519
Speaker 1: Uh, clusterfuck.

245
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,599
Speaker 0: Alright, now, a lot of people have said a lot of things.

246
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:52,780
Speaker 0: The first thing a lot of people point out is that what was going on in the con, as in the things happening there that were supposed to happen, were actually quite good.

247
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:58,820
Speaker 0: And while I did not experience them, despite my attempt to do so, I really can't disagree.

248
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,900
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the list of just people that were there, if you're into-- you know, if you know who these people are, is quite astounding.

249
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,559
Speaker 1: Now, I have a counterpoint to that, in that, according to people who were there, there were all those panels, and they all looked kinda good, right?

250
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:23,698
Speaker 1: Apparently, despite the fact that the exhibit area was so full of people, the state police were turning people away, almost no one went to panels, and even the panels that happened were mostly empty rooms.

251
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,640
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is, some panels that people cared about were just full up, because people were trying to escape the crowded exhibit room.

252
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, but every other panel-- The panels that no one cared about, no one went to, because they didn't want to get stuck out.

253
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, then there were the panels where people couldn't go to them, because the people who were doing them were turned away by security.

254
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:51,999
Speaker 0: Yup, Douglas Rushkoff, one of the guys I wanted to see there, who I didn't get to see, because I didn't get in, which I'll tell you about, he actually couldn't get to one of his signings, because he got stuck out.

255
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,880
Speaker 0: And he was a guest, an official guest of the con.

256
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,258
Speaker 1: So maybe before you talk about what was going to happen at the con, did you talk about what happened at the con?

257
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:03,100
Speaker 0: So I arrive at this con, and it's a comic con in the Javits Center.

258
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:13,680
Speaker 1: Now, I was going to go, and the only reason I didn't was that I actually got sick at Katsu Con, and all last week, I was fairly ill and full of NyQuil while I was doing the show.

259
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,033
Speaker 1: So Saturday morning, I wake up around 8 to catch the train with Scott, and I didn't feel like going.

260
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,299
Speaker 1: I just rolled over and went to bed.

261
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,779
Speaker 1: Our friend Scott Johnson, who was also going to go, was also sick, also from Katsu Con, so he didn't go either.

262
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,059
Speaker 1: So I know I talked Katsu Con up for being awesome, it gets one more point of awesome for saving me from the New York Comic Con.

263
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,797
Speaker 0: Yup, luck.

264
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:35,718
Speaker 0: Luck be you.

265
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,100
Speaker 0: So I get there, and if you've ever been to the Javits Center, it's not like other convention centers.

266
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:47,660
Speaker 0: It's a main hall on the first floor, and first of all, the lobby is huge.

267
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,960
Speaker 0: Lobby could be an entire convention room, but it's not, it's just a lobby.

268
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,959
Speaker 0: But it's actually good, because a lot of convention centers don't have big enough lobbies, and this one can pretty much handle anything you throw at it.

269
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:06,680
Speaker 0: It's an invincible lobby, with a coat check in the basement, and plenty of room for registration lines and booths, and all kinds of stuff.

270
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,359
Speaker 0: There's even like a whole food court up there, with actually somewhat decently priced food.

271
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,539
Speaker 1: The Javits is where the New York Auto Show is.

272
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:14,900
Speaker 1: The Javits is enormous.

273
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,338
Speaker 0: The Javits is where every convention in New York is, because it's the only place you can put one.

274
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:19,880
Speaker 0: There is no other convention center.

275
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,900
Speaker 1: Now the Javits has a lot of problems, in that it's on the west side of Manhattan, all alone.

276
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:28,019
Speaker 0: It's hard to get to it by subway.

277
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,400
Speaker 0: You have to take a taxi, or a bus, or your feet.

278
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,511
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are only two buses that I know of.

279
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,120
Speaker 1: that go to it, and they're real inconvenient.

280
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,740
Speaker 1: The subway doesn't go to it.

281
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,840
Speaker 0: There are a couple shuttles that go there, but it's not worth it.

282
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,000
Speaker 0: You're better off just walking.

283
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,080
Speaker 0: Get a subway as close as you can, which is probably like Penn Station, and walk.

284
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:46,820
Speaker 0: Or take a taxi if you got money, or if you're in a rush.

285
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,395
Speaker 0: Whatever.

286
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,780
Speaker 0: So you go into the Javits, it's a giant lobby.

287
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,740
Speaker 0: On the main floor, there are three giant rooms, which is the main convention area.

288
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:55,638
Speaker 0: This place is huge.

289
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,780
Speaker 0: These are like super high ceilings, super large in square footage rooms.

290
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,540
Speaker 0: We're talking tremendous football field, many times rooms.

291
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,640
Speaker 0: And usually when there's a convention, they take all three of those rooms combined.

292
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,260
Speaker 0: Very rarely do they split up those rooms, but they can, and they have in the past.

293
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,098
Speaker 0: But usually it's one big room.

294
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,680
Speaker 0: Upstairs there's like this T-shaped room, and it's pretty small, relative, but it's not small overall.

295
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:27,820
Speaker 0: And, you know, usually cons will use that as an auxiliary room.

296
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,699
Speaker 0: And downstairs, there is the downstairs hall, which is just a convention hall, and it's the downstairs hall.

297
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,637
Speaker 0: It's not as big as the main hall, it's just for little cons and things like that, you know, like a little tiny trade show, something like that.

298
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,218
Speaker 0: So I get there, and I fully expect the con to be taking up all three of the main, you know, the giant giant rooms.

299
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,160
Speaker 0: Much to my amazement, it is in the downstairs little tiny convention hall.

300
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,900
Speaker 0: And I said, "Uh oh, that's not right.

301
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,830
Speaker 0: It's going to be mighty cramped in

302
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,052
Speaker 0: there.".

303
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:00,638
Speaker 0: Then I saw something else.

304
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,668
Speaker 0: Not only was it in the downstairs convention hall, it was one half of the downstairs convention hall.

305
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,159
Speaker 0: The other half of it was occupied by a travel show.

306
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,087
Speaker 1: Great.

307
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,159
Speaker 0: So, there was a line going out the door, but the line didn't intimidate me, because I've been in longer lines than that.

308
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,220
Speaker 0: This thing was like, this is a wuss line compared to lines I've been in.

309
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:31,080
Speaker 1: The line for the concert, the Lark concert at Otakon two years ago, that went like down the street around several blocks, and then just off into the distance.

310
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a wuss line.

311
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,460
Speaker 0: I mean, this thing was around only one corner of a building.

312
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,680
Speaker 0: It was maybe less than one football field length out the door of the Javits.

313
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,337
Speaker 0: So I just got into it like, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know, patiently, got pretty close to the building too.

314
00:19:46,342 --> 00:20:03,020
Speaker 0: You know, and there was stuff going on the line, a lot of people coming, walking back and forth up and down the line peddling stuff, you know, trying to sell their crap, give you their free little card with a coupon on it or something, or inviting you to go to a museum that has a comics exhibit, you know, all kinds of shit.

315
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,200
Speaker 0: A bunch of nerds hanging out in line.

316
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,440
Speaker 0: Surprisingly for a comic convention, I only saw like a couple Spider-Man type things.

317
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,889
Speaker 0: It seemed like the comic nerds might have like a t-shirt with a Superman or a Spider-Man on it.

318
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,680
Speaker 0: And I saw more Naruto headbands than I saw anything else.

319
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,460
Speaker 1: Well it seems to me that, I mean, there is this comic culture, but anime fans are the ones that have the conventions.

320
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,920
Speaker 1: So anime fans are in that convention mindset.

321
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,720
Speaker 1: So all the anime fans in New York City just came to this for a day, you know, they just came out of the woodwork, and they're numerous.

322
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,059
Speaker 0: It's just weird that the percentage of freaky type of action going on in the convention line was much less than what I was used to.

323
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:48,820
Speaker 0: So the line itself was pretty boring compared to what convention lines usually are.

324
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,220
Speaker 0: Like I couldn't really get a conversation going on with anyone or make any friends in the line.

325
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,399
Speaker 0: They were all just kind of bleh.

326
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,954
Speaker 0: You know, I was like, "Oh, so

327
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:57,458
Speaker 0: what?".

328
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:58,972
Speaker 0: And the people were just like, "Yeah,

329
00:20:59,113 --> 00:20:59,497
Speaker 0: whatever.".

330
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,459
Speaker 1: Wow, god, I mean even when we went to New York City to see Miyamoto, we just- No, because those are Nintendo kids, you can talk to them.

331
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anime kids we can talk to, gamers, we went to UberCon, everyone we met we just hung out with.

332
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:25,800
Speaker 0: I think it was just the people I was near in line, because I knew a lot of- there were a lot of people I know on the inside of the con I could have talked to, because I kind of know them from online and stuff, so I probably could have gotten good stuff from them, but in the line I was in, everyone was bleh.

333
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:35,320
Speaker 0: So then all of a sudden, this guy comes down the line with a megaphone, and he says, "We are not selling tickets anymore, we're sold out for today, go home, we have too many people.

334
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:42,774
Speaker 0: Unless you-" he says, "If you pre-ordered online, you know, if you already paid for your tickets, you can go and get in, otherwise, go

335
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:43,297
Speaker 0: home.".

336
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,780
Speaker 1: Now, if that had been where it ended, if they just sold out and they couldn't sell any more tickets, that would have been fantastic.

337
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,997
Speaker 1: That would have been a huge success, they would have known to get a bigger venue next year.

338
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:53,610
Speaker 0: Yup.

339
00:21:54,321 --> 00:22:00,340
Speaker 1: The second part of his statement, where people who had already bought their tickets are guaranteed in, was a filthy lie.

340
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,320
Speaker 0: Yup, there were people who had pre-registered who were just not able to get into the convention.

341
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,096
Speaker 0: Even people who had tickets, VIP tickets, which cost $100, right?

342
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,319
Speaker 1: State troopers came and made sure no one got in, the fire marshal could have just shut the whole thing down.

343
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:37,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically what was happening is, because the room was full to the max, they would like let 25 people out, and then let 25 people in, and let people out, and let people in, and the going was really slow, and even if you had, like, even people who were professionals who were supposed to, like, the president of DC Comics couldn't get in, because he had to wait for other people to get out.

344
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:41,100
Speaker 0: So no matter what your ticket status, you couldn't get into the thing.

345
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,980
Speaker 1: And people who were in realized this and wouldn't leave.

346
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,274
Speaker 0: Yup, people who were in wouldn't leave because it would take them up to two hours to get back in.

347
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:55,934
Speaker 0: So, people were pretty much staying in this thing as long as they could, before leaving, and not only that, while they were in there, it was so crowded.

348
00:22:55,975 --> 00:23:00,480
Speaker 0: you couldn't really stop and do stuff, because you would block the way immediately, it was so crowded.

349
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,273
Speaker 1: Not only all that, but Scott calls me from the city to tell me, "Oh, it's terrible, you're lucky you didn't come, I can't get in, it's a

350
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:07,534
Speaker 1: mess.".

351
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:18,680
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I was asleep in bed still at this point, so I wake up, I look online, I figure, alright, I'll go to the New York Comic-Con website, see what official announcement they've posted about the situation.

352
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,820
Speaker 1: They didn't even touch their website.

353
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,300
Speaker 1: In fact, they were still selling tickets online to the event for most of Saturday.

354
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:36,160
Speaker 1: I went through the entire process up until accepting the actual charge to my credit card, just to see if I could buy a ticket, and I could.

355
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,218
Speaker 0: They didn't stop selling tickets, I don't know if that actually would have gotten you a ticket.

356
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:50,738
Speaker 1: Oh, it would have, because they actually took the ticket system down later, and they put up a thing saying, "Don't buy tickets, if you bought one, we'll contact you," or something to that effect.

357
00:23:51,140 --> 00:24:08,319
Speaker 0: Their policy, technically, was we don't have to give you a refund if we don't want to, but actually, they did make amends and give a lot of people their money back, and they did-- They, "Alright, tell you what, we'll guarantee that you can come in tomorrow on Sunday,".

358
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:12,500
Speaker 1: way out, and most people were so pissed they wouldn't take that, they wanted their money.

359
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,041
Speaker 1: Yeah,

360
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:28,265
Speaker 0: and the other thing is, I think they were talking about giving people special guest status at next year's New York Comic-Con, which I think they're going to change-- They had a big poster that said, "New York Comic-Con, the next time, will be these dates in the same place,".

361
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:31,919
Speaker 0: but I have a feeling they're going to change the date to get the bigger convention hall.

362
00:24:32,482 --> 00:24:33,820
Speaker 0: At least one of the thirds of it.

363
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,000
Speaker 0: One of the thirds of it would have been sufficient, I think, for this size con.

364
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,200
Speaker 0: Two thirds of it would have been perfect.

365
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,439
Speaker 0: All three of them, maybe a little too big.

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,820
Speaker 1: Now, this really bothers me, just in the sense that it's so unprofessional.

367
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,580
Speaker 1: I mean, this was a big convention, a real convention, there was a lot of money involved.

368
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:50,867
Speaker 1: Huge.

369
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,499
Speaker 1: It was at the Javits in New York City, it's the first one.

370
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:07,420
Speaker 1: Now I would have assumed, because even the crappest tiny anime con has a contingency plan for what if too many people show up, or what if not enough people show up.

371
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,479
Speaker 1: Just contingency plans in case a disaster happens.

372
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:12,140
Speaker 1: This con had nothing.

373
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,140
Speaker 1: Not only did they not expect these people, which is understandable, but they had no way to deal with it whatsoever.

374
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:26,720
Speaker 1: And these people, I mean, I don't even know what I can say other than that I'm really disappointed in almost everyone involved.

375
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:34,840
Speaker 0: Well, what it comes down to is this, when you run a convention, you have to know the number of people you can fit in the space you have.

376
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,957
Speaker 0: You know, if you take out a restaurant, it says on the wall 200 people.

377
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:42,459
Speaker 0: So you know you don't let 200 people in, or more than 200 people in.

378
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:47,814
Speaker 0: They knew, they should have known, how many people they could have fit into the room they had.

379
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, Otakon knows.

380
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,259
Speaker 1: Katsukon knew.

381
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:50,833
Speaker 1: Yup.

382
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,380
Speaker 0: So they knew how many pre-sales they had online.

383
00:25:54,681 --> 00:26:12,459
Speaker 0: And I agree that based on the number of pre-sales, pre-orders, pre-regis, whatever you wanna call them, they had, that, you know, the average number for conventions, comic conventions, the number of registrations they would have had on-site would have been well below the limit of the number of people they could fit.

384
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:22,459
Speaker 0: However, when the time came, the number of on-site registrations was well beyond what they ever expected or could handle.

385
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:24,839
Speaker 0: Yet, that would have been fine too.

386
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:27,120
Speaker 0: You know, you didn't expect it, it happened.

387
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,620
Speaker 1: But they kept selling them.

388
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:35,299
Speaker 0: They kept selling on-site registrations to the point where they exceeded the limit of the number of people who could be in there.

389
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:37,739
Speaker 1: This is just inexcusable.

390
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:45,336
Speaker 0: People are trying to say, "Oh, the Javits, blah," or, "The police did it, there was nothing you could do, the fire marshal came

391
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:45,437
Speaker 0: in.".

392
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:50,098
Speaker 0: The fire marshal shouldn't have come in because you shouldn't have screwed up and put in too many people.

393
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:52,680
Speaker 1: They're lucky the fire marshal didn't just shut it down altogether.

394
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:04,108
Speaker 0: I would have been happier if the fire marshal shut it down because then you wouldn't have all these, you know, there's a bunch of people online who got in who were like, "Stop saying bad things about the convention, I got in and it was great, stop saying bad things about it, it was

395
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:04,357
Speaker 0: fun.".

396
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:05,098
Speaker 1: You know what that's like?

397
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:13,158
Speaker 1: I keep bringing up Penny Arcade quotes, but one of them said a while ago, "That's like telling a man in a wheelchair, 'Just fucking get up and walk, I can do

398
00:27:13,238 --> 00:27:13,299
Speaker 1: it.'".

399
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, come on, it's great, walking is so fun, come on.

400
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:25,220
Speaker 0: I'm in a wheelchair, man, I got, you know, paralyzed legs, I'm Superman, Christopher Reeve, comic convention, ha ha ha.

401
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,440
Speaker 1: That was probably the thinnest thread.

402
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,618
Speaker 0: I couldn't, I tried to make up a joke out of it, instead I just said all the parts of the joke.

403
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:42,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, that's only one step beyond doing the whole, "I could make a joke about that, but I won't," which just means you didn't make up a joke and you still wanted to be a funny man.

404
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,580
Speaker 0: You just, but you did at least recognize the opportunity for joke.

405
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:46,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

406
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:54,459
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's the story of the New York Comic Con, unless there's something crazy next year, I'm probably not gonna go.

407
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:06,909
Speaker 0: Like they would have to, like I would need someone who went on Friday to call me and tell me, "It was awesome, here are ten awesome things worth your money, and here's why it's guaranteed that you'll be able to get in,".

408
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,760
Speaker 0: and all kinds of assurances.

409
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:15,720
Speaker 1: Now my take on all this is that they're really trying to spin it at the New York Comic Con, saying that, "This is fantastic!

410
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:19,837
Speaker 1: It was so huge that next year's gonna be crazy, we'll get the

411
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:20,158
Speaker 1: works!".

412
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,380
Speaker 1: The problem is, it was huge this year, yeah.

413
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:32,600
Speaker 1: How many of those people are so angry, because you should see some of the posts people are making online about their experience at this con, they're not coming back, ever.

414
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:38,129
Speaker 1: If they hear New York Comic Con, they'll remember it as, "That horrible con that sucked, that I'll never go to

415
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,453
Speaker 1: again.".

416
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:50,260
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's a tough call, and the only way you're gonna find out is, wait 'til next year, I mean, it could be that, yeah, a million people show up again trying to get in, or it could be a million, no one goes because it sucked.

417
00:28:50,580 --> 00:29:16,058
Speaker 1: Now the other thing is, it's my, this is my take on the numbers, because not many people came Friday, not many people went Sunday, Saturday was shit crazy, now, I was probably gonna go, and I remember looking at the website, trying to decide if I wanted to, and it was about 90-95% trade show crap, you know, buy stuff, we market to you, blah, and 5% cool people doing stuff.

418
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,820
Speaker 1: At least, that seems to be the ratio that I saw, and not many of the events looked at.

419
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,280
Speaker 1: all really interesting, I guess I get more fun at any other kind of con.

420
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:36,600
Speaker 0: But really, a Comic Con is just usually a big room full of booths, and panel rooms and stuff on the sides, with a little video gaming, a little regular gaming, and a little anime action, right?

421
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:54,580
Speaker 0: But what you do at a Comic Con is, unless it's the San Diego Comic Con, which literally takes a day to see all the booths, because there are so many, it's insane, this one, if the room wasn't crowded as all hell, you probably could have seen and looked through everything you wanted to see in a couple hours.

422
00:29:55,181 --> 00:30:09,740
Speaker 0: If you went shopping and tried to purchase, you know, things out of the giant 50 cent boxes full of comics, you could have added maybe 15, 20 minutes per dealer, so maybe in five hours you can see the whole entire convention.

423
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,340
Speaker 1: Now here's what I'm getting at.

424
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:24,512
Speaker 0: The point of the convention, Comic Conventions anyway, is you do that at some point, you know, you go around and see everything, and then when, you know, you have time to go and meet creators when they have their little signings, and you can actually talk to them like, "Hey, what's

425
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:24,675
Speaker 0: up?".

426
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:34,919
Speaker 0: And if that doesn't interest you, well then you're losing a little bit out of, you really not a lot of reason to go, but the final reason to go to a comic convention is you just sit around talking to all the other people there.

427
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,685
Speaker 1: Now that plays along with.

428
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:46,920
Speaker 1: what I was getting at, is that they basically seem to guess their numbers based on people coming for the whole weekend, like they seem to think that people would have some reason to come more than one day.

429
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:47,756
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

430
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,218
Speaker 1: So, you know, they sell a three day pass, and they didn't sell many of those ahead of time.

431
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:56,239
Speaker 1: Well, no one's going to pre-register for just one day of a convention like this.

432
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:57,200
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

433
00:30:57,561 --> 00:31:06,940
Speaker 1: So all the people like me, who really saw almost nothing they cared about at this con, but wanted to, you know, just check it out, showed up on Saturday.

434
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:14,620
Speaker 1: And a lot of people live near New York City, so a lot of people, it was well within their means to just show up for one day suddenly out of the blue.

435
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:25,736
Speaker 0: What also happened, I heard this, I'm not sure how 100% true it is, that the convention, like the people running it, thought the turnout was going to be crummy based on the pre-regs and such.

436
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:26,597
Speaker 1: I saw that too.

437
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:34,735
Speaker 0: And they went around, like, somewhat apologizing to dealers and exhibitors saying, "We're sorry if this really sucks, there isn't going to be a lot of people

438
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:34,895
Speaker 0: here.".

439
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,718
Speaker 0: Because they really didn't, you know, they honestly did not know how many people were going to show up.

440
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:50,978
Speaker 0: And because they honestly did not think a lot of people were going to show up, they sponsored podcasts, and they put commercials on cable television, and they advertised in comic books.

441
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,580
Speaker 0: They advertised like crazy to get people to come to this con.

442
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,499
Speaker 0: The thing is, that advertising didn't result in pre-regs, it resulted in people showing up Saturday trying to come for a day.

443
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Speaker 1: People for whom they did not plan, and for whom they had no contingency, and therefore ruined their own convention.

444
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:07,469
Speaker 0: Mhm.

445
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:23,259
Speaker 0: The final thing, though, is that the convention got, there were two things on the internet, there was an official statement from the convention, and there was the guy who runs the convention who actually seems to be a smart guy who knows how to run conventions, except, you know, he made one mistake this time.

446
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,033
Speaker 0: But, uh, basically they said, "We're sorry, we screwed up, we messed up, we'll try to make it better next

447
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:30,256
Speaker 0: year.".

448
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,100
Speaker 0: You know, so they did admit fault.

449
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,517
Speaker 0: I don't know what that, you know, that doesn't really do anything for you if you got left out in the cold, but- It's definitely a step up from the people who try to say, "Oh, we do no

450
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:40,879
Speaker 0: wrong!".

451
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:48,237
Speaker 1: Because you see that at a lot, some other conventions, you know, people will complain, and you'll hear a staff member just kind of spin it, like, "Oh, that was your

452
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:48,599
Speaker 1: fault!"

453
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,474
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, blah blah

454
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,118
Speaker 1: blah.".

455
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:56,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just like, "Oh, we screwed up, we didn't expect this many people, we expect,".

456
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,358
Speaker 0: you know, but hey, at the same time, you know, you sold too many tickets, and you shouldn't have done that.

457
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:11,231
Speaker 1: So if they didn't sell too many tickets, I really wouldn't be able to say anyone did anything bad, but- Now if they'd screwed up anything else, I would have thought, "Alright, it's a big con, I can see you screwing it

458
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:11,353
Speaker 1: up.".

459
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:15,940
Speaker 1: But that's, like, the number one, you have to pay attention to that.

460
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,839
Speaker 1: The thing they screwed up is the most basic, like, that's like the second thing you do.

461
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:30,097
Speaker 1: First, you've booked the place, or you decide what you're gonna do or whatever, and then you, I think, call them and ask what the capacity is, then you call the fire marshal and have them talk to you.

462
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:35,940
Speaker 1: I mean, I've done that for events that I ran for my club back when I was in college.

463
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:37,378
Speaker 1: It's not that hard.

464
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:46,780
Speaker 1: The fire marshal will tell you exactly what the rules are, and if you don't want to deal with the fire marshal, whoever owns the building has a book that'll tell you how many people can be in the room-

465
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,798
Speaker 0: And whoever owns the building is responsible for knowing, or else the fire marshal will come and get them.

466
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,340
Speaker 0: So, I think that's all we gotta say about the New York Comic Con.

467
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:08,237
Speaker 0: Okay, so now, I want to talk about something which has been interesting me for quite a while now, since I, you know, somewhat rekindled my interest in comic books, at least American ones, you know, in the past year or so.

468
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,600
Speaker 0: It's the way they're distributed in North America.

469
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:18,659
Speaker 1: And to put it in a nutshell, for anyone who doesn't want to listen to the whole episode, it's done in an archaic, terrible, backward-.

470
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:19,699
Speaker 0: No, it's not archaic.

471
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:20,619
Speaker 0: It just sucks.

472
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,696
Speaker 0: In fact, it's quite new, and that's why it sucks, is 'cause it goes away from the old good way.

473
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:33,540
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the distribution isn't archaic, but the way people find out about new comics is- It's not ar- no, 'cause the archaic implies that it's old.

474
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,770
Speaker 0: It's actually a very new way of doing it.

475
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:37,158
Speaker 0: that is less than 20 years old.

476
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,360
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the medium.

477
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,799
Speaker 1: I'm holding a piece of paper- Oh, yeah.

478
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,565
Speaker 1: -bound together.

479
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,639
Speaker 1: that tells me when things come out- That's archaic.

480
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,300
Speaker 1: -as opposed to looking on the internet and just, or, you know, yeah.

481
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:48,179
Speaker 0: Well, here, let me start from the beginning.

482
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:56,418
Speaker 0: In before the early '80s, so before we were alive, comic books in America were distributed the same way magazines were.

483
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,240
Speaker 0: You know, it's a periodical distribution company.

484
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,580
Speaker 0: Now, the way this works is, let's say you're a store, and you want to sell magazines.

485
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:06,620
Speaker 0: You don't really care which magazines you sell.

486
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,777
Speaker 0: I mean, you can pick and choose, because you know some will sell better than others, but that's up to you.

487
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, some stores don't want to- like, Walmart doesn't want to sell pornography, things like that.

488
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:15,092
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

489
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,978
Speaker 0: And you pick which magazines you want, and how many issues of each one you want, and you pay a price.

490
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,020
Speaker 0: They deliver those magazines to you on a monthly basis, because they're monthly magazines.

491
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,759
Speaker 0: Of course, you know, different magazines ship different weeks, so you actually get shipments like weekly when new magazines come out.

492
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,619
Speaker 0: But you know, you get them, and if you don't sell them, you're allowed to return them.

493
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:38,220
Speaker 0: And that's why magazines are kind of expensive, you know?

494
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,100
Speaker 0: You go to the store, and if you want to buy, like, you know, a big video game magazine, it can cost you, like, five, six bucks.

495
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:45,919
Speaker 0: They're not cheap.

496
00:35:46,280 --> 00:36:01,339
Speaker 1: Now, the reason that magazines are often sold that way is mostly that it doesn't cost the magazine people as much to print it, and they usually expect that a bunch of them are going to come back, but they want the stores to display the magazine, even if the store doesn't think it'll sell.

497
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:04,040
Speaker 1: That way, it's basically advertising for the magazine.

498
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:22,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, magazines make their money on the ads and things, so their idea is to just increase readership, and the way this works is this is how you get those stores that sell a million magazines, 'cause you can do, you know, a small magazine can sell if it just gets shelf space.

499
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,660
Speaker 0: And if stores can return magazines they don't sell, they'll buy copies of freaking everything, because what do they care?

500
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,279
Speaker 0: They'll return it.

501
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,456
Speaker 1: Now, that business model, for anyone who remembers, is what almost killed TSR back in the D&D days.

502
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,999
Speaker 0: Yup.

503
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:47,660
Speaker 1: Because TSR had the same thing with all their Dungeons & Dragons books, and Dungeons & Dragons at one point tanked, and stores were sending them back by the truckload, and TSR almost went bankrupt.

504
00:36:48,362 --> 00:36:48,430
Speaker 0: Yup.

505
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:51,631
Speaker 0: So, that's also how books, I think, are sold.

506
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:58,519
Speaker 0: in normal books, like at Borders and things, is, you know, if they buy paperback books and they don't want 'em, they can send 'em back for a return.

507
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,919
Speaker 0: Actually, a trade paperback, which is, you know, those big books full of comics...

508
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:06,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't actually know this until Scott told me.

509
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,780
Speaker 0: They're called trade paperbacks because you can't send 'em back, you know, they stay there.

510
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,020
Speaker 0: And they're all, trade also means it's like a weird shape and a weird size.

511
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:17,520
Speaker 0: It's all publishing terms that I've learned by doing a little bit of research.

512
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,220
Speaker 0: Now, in the early 80s, the comic books weren't selling so well, and they needed more money.

513
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:34,260
Speaker 0: So, this guy, his name is Phil Seuling, S-E-U-L-I-N-G, he was a convention organizer, actually, a Comic-Con convention organizer.

514
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,359
Speaker 0: He said, "You know what?

515
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,798
Speaker 0: Um, we're not selling so well on newsstands.

516
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,953
Speaker 0: Let me find a way to get comics to be more

517
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:43,415
Speaker 0: profitable.".

518
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:56,020
Speaker 0: His idea was that instead of, you know, distributing through the periodical market, you know, distributors, that you, if you wanted to sell comics, you would buy them directly from the publisher.

519
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,732
Speaker 0: So you would say, "Marvel Comics, give me some

520
00:37:57,752 --> 00:37:58,397
Speaker 0: Spider-Mans!".

521
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:06,220
Speaker 0: The way this worked is, well, you got a huge discount because you bought 'em, there were no middlemen between you and the publisher.

522
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,540
Speaker 0: No one was jacking up the price to make a profit.

523
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,440
Speaker 0: You also got a huge discount because you couldn't return them.

524
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,179
Speaker 0: You bought it, you sold it.

525
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,799
Speaker 0: Or you bought it, it was for you, and you read it, you know?

526
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:24,077
Speaker 1: Now most people, like when I hear the word trade paperback, I just think, "Alright, that's the real book format of comic as opposed to the crappy comic format of

527
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:24,379
Speaker 1: comic.".

528
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,739
Speaker 1: And I just never put any thought into it beyond that.

529
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,900
Speaker 0: Right, so, this is what they did in the early 80s, is they switched to this direct delivery?

530
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:35,580
Speaker 0: where you want comic, you wanna sell comics, you have to buy them direct from the publisher.

531
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:52,818
Speaker 0: The problem with this is that now you couldn't get comics so easily in the newsstands and all kinds of places because those places weren't about to buy comic books and try to sell them and not be able to return them.

532
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,759
Speaker 0: You know, why, they're not gonna stock something they can't return.

533
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,000
Speaker 0: So the places to buy comic books were reduced to comic shops.

534
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:04,920
Speaker 0: But the price of comics went down and the profitability was maintained.

535
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:21,239
Speaker 0: That was until the 90s where they screwed up by, you know, what happened was they, the comic book stores, because there was a flood of speculation, people buying comics just to make money off of them, and of course those people never made money off of them.

536
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,020
Speaker 0: So they were shipping way too many, people were buying way too many copies of comics.

537
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:30,180
Speaker 1: This is the era of when, like, two characters would get married or a character would die.

538
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,099
Speaker 0: So they'd-- And they'd put holograms on the cover of the comic books and have two different covers.

539
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:45,973
Speaker 1: They'd issue the same comic book in, like, it had four different covers, and each one would be a different hologram, and collectors would buy, like, eight copies of each one and put them each in their sealed bags and never touch them, hoping to sell them someday for a lot of

540
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:46,179
Speaker 0: money.

541
00:39:46,260 --> 00:40:06,998
Speaker 0: Now there's still a little bit of that today, but this is, like, the time when it was an epidemic, is they would send way too many copies of every comic to the store, and eventually they didn't sell them all, and no one could return them, so the comic book store went out of business, comic book stores went out of business, the comic book companies have no one else to sell comic books to, uh oh.

542
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,920
Speaker 0: And that was when the 90s comic books pretty went downhill.

543
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,980
Speaker 0: Then came along this company, Diamond Comic Distributors.

544
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,360
Speaker 0: Diamond Comic Distributors is a direct distributor.

545
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,178
Speaker 0: What they do is, it's the same old model that they switched to in the early 80s.

546
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:29,260
Speaker 0: You know, you buy direct from the publishers, you can't return them, it's really cheap.

547
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Speaker 0: What they do is, they bought, just kind of like Microsoft, they bought every other direct distributor, or the other direct distributors went out of business.

548
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:48,080
Speaker 0: So if you want a Marvel or DC comic, the only way to get them for your store is directly distributed through this company, Diamond Distributors.

549
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:49,178
Speaker 0: That's it.

550
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,619
Speaker 0: You can't get them like magazines, you can't, it's it.

551
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:52,936
Speaker 0: Only one thing.

552
00:40:55,101 --> 00:41:02,760
Speaker 0: Tokyo Pop on the other hand, or Viz, or any of those manga distributors, you know, or manga publishers, they distribute through Diamond also.

553
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:10,740
Speaker 0: But they also distribute through the periodical distributors and the book store distributors and all kinds of other things, 'cause they don't have an exclusive agreement.

554
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,900
Speaker 0: But Marvel and DC comics sell only through Diamond Distributors.

555
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:41,940
Speaker 0: So, Diamond Distributors is a company that, because they can give you such a discount, and because things can't be returned, and because the things that they sell are sold in comic book stores, where they know that it's pretty much a place that nerds go to to buy things, they have the ability to sell really crazy, specialized stuff.

556
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:57,059
Speaker 0: And the way it works is they have a catalog that they put out every month that lists every single thing that they are going to distribute to comic book stores two months from now.

557
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:05,320
Speaker 1: So the March issue of this catalog is in my hands right now, I've been flipping through it while Scott's been talking.

558
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,860
Speaker 0: We'll tell you what's going to come out in May.

559
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,560
Speaker 1: Because apparently these people have never heard of the internet.

560
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,596
Speaker 0: Well, on the internet, you can get a list of everything that's going to come out in a month.

561
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,479
Speaker 0: Just a plain text file list.

562
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:24,780
Speaker 0: You can't get a picture of everything, and you can't get a description and a price and a rel- you know, all the information.

563
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:25,819
Speaker 0: You can't get all of it.

564
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,640
Speaker 0: You can only get, you know, the base.

565
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:31,120
Speaker 0: This is the name, this is the number, this is the price, this is the date.

566
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,338
Speaker 0: So the idea is that they want you to buy this catalog for five bucks to find out.

567
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:43,019
Speaker 0: And it gets a little bit out of hand.

568
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:56,340
Speaker 1: Well, first off, just to- not to disparage comic book readers, but flipping through this, I'd say at least 60-70% of the female characters portrayed in the previews of this book.

569
00:42:56,842 --> 00:43:01,440
Speaker 1: Now, not counting the ones that are for anime/manga, because those are actually normal.

570
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:03,240
Speaker 1: All the ones that are from comics?

571
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,339
Speaker 1: This woman's breasts are bigger than, like, basketballs.

572
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:09,139
Speaker 1: They're bigger than her head.

573
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,517
Speaker 0: Wow, yeah.

574
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,197
Speaker 1: And they're all like this.

575
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:14,080
Speaker 1: They're- oh god.

576
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:16,380
Speaker 1: Every page of this book is just paint.

577
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,440
Speaker 0: See, that's the problem with the direct market, that it's a side effect of the distribution.

578
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:31,000
Speaker 0: They tried to lower the price, and at the same time they sacrificed being distributed and sold in a wide variety of places.

579
00:43:31,381 --> 00:43:32,380
Speaker 0: Only comic book stores.

580
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,060
Speaker 0: Because only comic book stores, everything they want to sell is targeting a very small demographic of people.

581
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:50,059
Speaker 0: So now everything that gets made is always a superhero comic, it's always some girl with big boobs, it's always, you know, stuff that you can sell a lot of to people in a comic book store.

582
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:53,019
Speaker 1: There's a surprising amount of furry comics in here, too.

583
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, so now, the best thing that comic book companies can do, because they've already made a contract with Diamond.

584
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,840
Speaker 0: They have no choice but to only sell things through Diamond Direct.

585
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:18,400
Speaker 0: What they do is they design their product to make it so that they sell it to as many nerds as possible, whereas other companies, like the manga companies, try to sell to as many people as possible.

586
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:20,419
Speaker 0: They target people in general.

587
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,900
Speaker 0: Whereas Marvel and DC, when they make comic books, they can't sell it to people.

588
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,500
Speaker 0: They can only sell it in comic book stores or to places that get stuff from Diamond.

589
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:36,519
Speaker 1: The net result of this, there are like ten different Superman statues in this thing for sale right now.

590
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,920
Speaker 1: Well, they'll be for sale in two months.

591
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:47,580
Speaker 1: There are at least twenty Superman toys where Superman can fly, or you can throw Superman and then he flies, or he shoots discs out of his stomach.

592
00:44:47,863 --> 00:44:49,780
Speaker 0: We're not kidding, he shoots discs out of his stomach.

593
00:44:52,141 --> 00:45:02,720
Speaker 0: So this is really the reason that comics are not doing so good in this country, is because of this history and the resulting distribution model that currently exists.

594
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:07,080
Speaker 0: And a lot of people just don't understand, you know, how it came to be.

595
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:21,540
Speaker 0: I didn't understand how it came to be, but now I see, you know, this is the real reason why, you know, now that I understand, manga isn't kicking comic book's ass because the art is different or better, you know, people don't seem to care about that.

596
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,880
Speaker 0: The fact that you don't have to know a whole bunch of history to read the stories is a factor, but it's not the number one factor.

597
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,278
Speaker 0: The number one factor is that comic books only try to sell to nerds because of the distribution model.

598
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:48,340
Speaker 1: So instead of making, you know, a cool, realistic story about something new and original, they'll try to sell you a, I'm not kidding, Scott said it, I didn't believe him, but then I saw it all over this magazine, Pirate Nightcrawler.

599
00:45:49,802 --> 00:45:51,580
Speaker 1: So there's Nightcrawler from the X-Men, right?

600
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:53,900
Speaker 0: You know, the guy who goes, what does he say?

601
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,293
Speaker 1: He goes like, bamf, and he teleports.

602
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:58,359
Speaker 1: He's the blue devil-looking guy.

603
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:03,240
Speaker 1: So they dressed him up like a pirate and made a bust, and you can buy it for a lot of money.

604
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:04,559
Speaker 0: How much was it?

605
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,439
Speaker 1: It was like 50 bucks, it wasn't that bad.

606
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:12,524
Speaker 1: I mean, the frickin' kryptonite statue that's just a green rock in a glass case was like 200 bucks.

607
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:15,699
Speaker 1: That's it.

608
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,400
Speaker 1: There's not even a comic involved.

609
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,940
Speaker 1: It's just Nightcrawler as his favorite persona in the danger room.

610
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:38,319
Speaker 0: See, if comics were still distributed to newsstands and targeted towards all kinds of people, then the boutique-style comic book stores that were trying to pay, you know, trying to get nerd patrons and sell them as much as possible, wouldn't really exist or do so well.

611
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,560
Speaker 0: And thus, things like this wouldn't be able to exist, you know?

612
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:47,238
Speaker 0: Or you couldn't sell a stupid Superman or a Pirate Nightcrawler for 50 bucks because no one would buy it.

613
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:55,240
Speaker 1: Or maybe, let's say that they distributed them in a better way and the stores were good, and people generally knew who Nightcrawler was instead of just nerds knowing.

614
00:46:56,201 --> 00:47:01,980
Speaker 1: And then people generally knew that Nightcrawler likes to be a pirate in the danger room, which only super nerds know.

615
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:02,859
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that.

616
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,919
Speaker 0: I don't think he does, does he?

617
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:05,580
Speaker 1: It says that in the magazine.

618
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,319
Speaker 0: Does it really?

619
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:06,667
Speaker 0: Yeah.

620
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,080
Speaker 0: I've read quite a few, and not a lot of X-Men comics, you know.

621
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:10,940
Speaker 0: It might just be made up.

622
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,140
Speaker 1: It might just be made up to sell this bust, I don't know.

623
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,272
Speaker 1: Maybe.

624
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,819
Speaker 0: Maybe I've read 50 at most.

625
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,899
Speaker 1: But say people knew about that.

626
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:28,170
Speaker 1: Then, if you were in just, you know, a general nerd store, not a comic shop, but just a nerd store, like the Dragon's End or Millennium, and you saw a Nightcrawler bust for some money, you might think, "Oh, that's

627
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:28,392
Speaker 1: cool.".

628
00:47:29,301 --> 00:47:35,600
Speaker 1: But this Nightcrawler bust only seems to be marketed toward scary nerds who have every comic that ever had Nightcrawler in it anyway.

629
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:36,409
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

630
00:47:36,742 --> 00:47:36,930
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

631
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,198
Speaker 0: That's what they do.

632
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,820
Speaker 1: I mean, Scott, I want to read more comics, I just don't have time.

633
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:46,120
Speaker 1: And if I end up commuting to the city on the train, I'm going to be reading mad comics.

634
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,360
Speaker 1: But Scott's much more into the wet, non-anime, non-manga, non-webcomic comic culture.

635
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:54,699
Speaker 1: And I'm not so much.

636
00:47:55,201 --> 00:48:01,120
Speaker 1: And everything I see of it is generally kind of scary, fannish, and just frightening.

637
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't read that stuff, you know?

638
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:06,308
Speaker 0: I try-- 'cause there is stuff that gets distributed.

639
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:15,940
Speaker 0: that isn't, you know, crazy, you know, stupid Marvel DC standards or crazy giant boobage, you know?

640
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,600
Speaker 0: And I try to find that stuff, and it's pretty hard to find.

641
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:30,220
Speaker 0: I mean, you have this giant comic book store full of all this giant catalog worth of shit every month, and there's something in that store that is not selling well, because only nerds come to the store.

642
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:36,479
Speaker 1: So if it's-- But that thing might be awesome, it might have real good mainstream appeal, it might just be a good story, but you'll never find it.

643
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it can only sell it to nerds, because that's the only way to sell comics is in the nerd store.

644
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:50,560
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I can go to frickin' Waldenbooks in the mall, there's a giant, giant manga shelf, and I can just look around and immediately see anything new, anything interesting.

645
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,319
Speaker 1: I can name a topic and probably find a manga about it.

646
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:54,320
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

647
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,460
Speaker 0: And it's not because it's a manga, it's because the way it's distributed.

648
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,880
Speaker 0: I mean, Waldenbooks does have a comic spinner rack, and a lot of grocery stores have it, too.

649
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,980
Speaker 1: What, they have, like, Archie.

650
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:22,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has Archie because that actually sells to a lot of girls, they have Sonic the Hedgehog, I guarantee it, 'cause that sells, they have Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Captain America, Fantastic Four, The Avengers, The Justice League, The Green Lantern, all, you know, Batman and Robin, they have the standards, the things that just about anyone will like.

651
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,999
Speaker 0: And this is actually why, if you go to the store, you'll see, you know, I ask the same question every day.

652
00:49:29,462 --> 00:49:31,380
Speaker 0: Why are there five Spider-Man comic books?

653
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,719
Speaker 0: You know, why don't they just have Spider-Man?

654
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:34,859
Speaker 0: Just one comic.

655
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,360
Speaker 0: Well, they've got Amazing Spider-Man, which is the default.

656
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:41,360
Speaker 0: They've got Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, which is more friendly.

657
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,700
Speaker 0: They've got Spider-Man Adventures, which is for kids.

658
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:54,880
Speaker 0: They've got Marvel Knights Spider-Man, which is all dark and serious and more gory and for more serious readers and mature, whatever.

659
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,339
Speaker 0: You know, they cover all these--.

660
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:59,400
Speaker 1: You sound like a Halo Xbox fanboy.

661
00:49:59,806 --> 00:49:59,897
Speaker 1: Yeah.

662
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:01,299
Speaker 1: I only play mature games.

663
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:01,780
Speaker 0: Yeah.

664
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:03,820
Speaker 0: I don't even know the freaking all of 'em.

665
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:04,719
Speaker 0: Don't ask me.

666
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:05,580
Speaker 0: I don't pay attention.

667
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,680
Speaker 0: I just know there's way too many, and thus, I can't read any of them at all.

668
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:10,299
Speaker 0: And it makes no sense.

669
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,180
Speaker 0: But it does make sense for this market, because you have a nerd comes into the store.

670
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:19,080
Speaker 0: If you only have one Spider-Man comic, he's gonna buy one Spider-Man comic a month.

671
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,239
Speaker 0: If you have five-- He's gonna buy five.

672
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:22,639
Speaker 1: Now, we keep saying nerd.

673
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:31,419
Speaker 1: This is Geek Nights, and I know we've said it before, but just in case you haven't listened to any of the episodes where we talk about it, we make a big distinction between geek and nerd.

674
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,539
Speaker 0: A geek is someone cool and a nerd is not.

675
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,220
Speaker 1: Basically.

676
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,360
Speaker 1: A geek is basically a nerd with social skills or someone who-- Like, say you're a car geek.

677
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:40,640
Speaker 1: You're interested in cars.

678
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,659
Speaker 1: You know a lot about cars.

679
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:42,539
Speaker 1: But you know what?

680
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:44,439
Speaker 1: There are other aspects to your life.

681
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,060
Speaker 1: A nerd, a car nerd, knows everything about every car, but he's never kissed a girl.

682
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:50,820
Speaker 0: Yup.

683
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,240
Speaker 0: A nerd is the guy who gets all A's in class.

684
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:54,830
Speaker 0: Worst.

685
00:50:55,205 --> 00:50:55,500
Speaker 0: Person.

686
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:56,480
Speaker 1: Ever.

687
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:05,780
Speaker 0: Is studying and doing work for his class and sucking up to the teacher and doing extra credit and, you know, he looks like a nerd and walks like a nerd and talks like a nerd.

688
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,276
Speaker 0: He is a nerd.

689
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:14,499
Speaker 0: A geek is just someone who has interesting geeky things or, you know, has hobbies, 'cause, you know, that they actually get into.

690
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we're just kind of weird in that we're geeks about a lot of different things.

691
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,450
Speaker 1: Yup.

692
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,258
Speaker 1: But, I mean, we're geeks.

693
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,060
Speaker 1: We have-- I mean, for all the geekery, I frickin' mountain bike and do weird crap outside.

694
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,339
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of a non-geeky thing that Scott does, but I really can't.

695
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything I do is geeky.

696
00:51:32,682 --> 00:51:32,836
Speaker 1: Yeah.

697
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:34,860
Speaker 0: But I do a lot of things that are geeky.

698
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:35,919
Speaker 1: You cook McDonald's eggs.

699
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,000
Speaker 0: I don't cook McDonald's eggs.

700
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,099
Speaker 0: You cook McDonald's eggs.

701
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:38,859
Speaker 0: I don't.

702
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,280
Speaker 0: Whatever.

703
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,299
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

704
00:51:43,640 --> 00:52:03,880
Speaker 0: There's a giant catalog called "previews" and that tells you everything Diamond is gonna distribute and it's a scary catalog and comic book stores have a bad distribution model that is keeping comics in a rut and it's pretty much a sad state of things and it'll stay this way for quite a while because Marvel and DC have exclusive contracts with Diamond.

705
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:08,200
Speaker 1: Now, I'd like to hear what-- if the, uh-- 'cause I know you listen to Comic Geek speak.

706
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,720
Speaker 1: I'd like to hear if they have some sort of rebuttal to that.

707
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:12,520
Speaker 0: Well, they don't really have a rebuttal.

708
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:23,840
Speaker 0: What they-- you know, the story is pretty true and what they say is-- 'cause we had an argument on their forums or a discussion-- it wasn't really a heated argument-- about, you know, they said you gotta buy previews.

709
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,719
Speaker 0: They couldn't imagine someone not buying it.

710
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:38,620
Speaker 0: And the fact is that some people who get comics get previews at a really discounted rate or free because comic book stores want to give it to you so that you can see stuff and get excited about things 'cause it's basically a giant advertisement.

711
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,199
Speaker 0: So giving it to people for free doesn't hurt you so much.

712
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,340
Speaker 0: They were like, "We can't imagine someone not buying it.

713
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:45,172
Speaker 0: How would you know what to

714
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:45,355
Speaker 0: get?".

715
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,480
Speaker 1: Now, now, I submit to them because I don't read a lot of comics yet, but you know what?

716
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,120
Speaker 1: If I walk into a comic shop and I see it, I know it came out.

717
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:52,800
Speaker 0: Exactly.

718
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:59,818
Speaker 1: If I'm actually interested in it ahead of time, I'll find it on the internets long before I would find it in some magazine that costs money.

719
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:00,536
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

720
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:10,500
Speaker 0: Now, they had a slight problem in that they knew that you could search for the information on the internet, but their thing was like, "Oh, that would take so long and be so much effort," or whatever.

721
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,040
Speaker 0: And I was like-- and they said, "You know what?

722
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,957
Speaker 0: It doesn't actually matter as long as you get the information and pre-order your

723
00:53:16,997 --> 00:53:17,398
Speaker 0: comics.".

724
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,780
Speaker 1: Now that's where Scott disagrees again, and I am inclined to agree with his disagreeing.

725
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,255
Speaker 0: Yes.

726
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,440
Speaker 0: You see, previews tells you what comics are coming out two months from now.

727
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,178
Speaker 0: Two months!

728
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,639
Speaker 0: So if it's-- what's it, February-- it's March now, so the March previews tells you what's coming out in May.

729
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:41,080
Speaker 1: All right, by the time May comes around, I'm not gonna know or care what comics-- two months is like a lifetime, as far as I'm concerned.

730
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,617
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

731
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:49,179
Speaker 0: Because the way the distribution works, comic book stores don't really make a big margin on comics.

732
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:54,320
Speaker 0: And if they can't return things, you know, because you buy 'em, you got 'em.

733
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,279
Speaker 0: That's why they had those back-issue bins and such, where they try to sell all the comics they didn't sell when they were new.

734
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:06,458
Speaker 0: So what they want you to do is pre-order your comic books, the same way you pre-order video games.

735
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:13,940
Speaker 1: You know-- I could see that if I was like-- say I read, I don't know, Rockato, and I liked it a lot.

736
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:18,260
Speaker 1: Maybe I might want to pre-order more, 'cause I already know I like it.

737
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,260
Speaker 1: That way I don't have to worry about it.

738
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,736
Speaker 1: I'll just get it.

739
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:30,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the way a subscription or a pre-order usually works is you say what you want, and they automatically-- they keep a list of your name and what you want, and whenever something you want comes into the store, they put it in a little folder.

740
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,620
Speaker 0: And then when you come into the store, you go to your folder and you empty it out.

741
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,178
Speaker 0: And you take all your stuff and you buy it.

742
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,060
Speaker 0: But you're sort of obligated to buy it if they put it in the folder.

743
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:38,660
Speaker 0: You know?

744
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:44,320
Speaker 0: It depends on the store and who's running it, and there's some online services that let you order things months in advance.

745
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,096
Speaker 0: And usually when you order things in advance, you get like a 40% discount.

746
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:55,240
Speaker 0: Because, you know, if a store-- like a video game store is the perfect example of how pre-orders save them a lot of money.

747
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,495
Speaker 0: 'Cause you make a $40 video game, the video game store probably paid $35 for, $30 for.

748
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,180
Speaker 0: So if they buy five of them and sell one, they lose money.

749
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:15,240
Speaker 0: They really have-- they want to buy exactly the number they're going to sell, or maybe one more than the number they're going to sell ever, to make the most money.

750
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:21,079
Speaker 0: So when they get pre-orders, they know that's a guaranteed sell, that they can buy that many copies.

751
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,927
Speaker 0: And a comic book store can't--.

752
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:27,839
Speaker 0: you know, unless you're a crazy, huge comic book store, you can't buy everything in this diamond catalog, so you need to pick and choose.

753
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,080
Speaker 0: You pretty much have to shop for your customers.

754
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,239
Speaker 1: Now point the first.

755
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,240
Speaker 1: If I haven't already read an issue of something, there's no way in hell I'm going to pre-order it.

756
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,999
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

757
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,860
Speaker 1: Two, it's a frickin' comic book.

758
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:44,420
Speaker 1: I barely even pre-order video games.

759
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:50,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only pre-order something if it's going to sell out right away, and I also want it right away.

760
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:58,199
Speaker 1: I mean, if I don't want something right away, even if I know it's going to sell out, I don't pre-order it, because it'll sell out, and then they'll make more, and then I'll buy it later.

761
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,040
Speaker 1: Probably cheaper.

762
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:07,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only pre-order if I'm worried that they're not going to make more, this is it, or I want it right now, like a Zelda game that's coming out.

763
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
Speaker 1: Twilight Princess, we should actually pre-order that soon.

764
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, for what, next year, two years from now?

765
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:11,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

766
00:56:12,981 --> 00:56:23,760
Speaker 0: So, the reason comic book stores want you to pre-order is because when you pre-order, it allows the comic book store to know what people want so that they can order the correct amount of copies and make more profit.

767
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:44,898
Speaker 0: At the same time, if a comic book isn't necessarily mainstream, or, by mainstream I mean mainstream to the nerds themselves, you know, like a Marvel or a DC, like Batman is a mainstream comic, you know, all the nerds buy Batman, but all the nerds don't buy Rocketo, half of them don't, never even heard of it, actually 90% of them never even heard of it.

768
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:57,159
Speaker 0: But if a bunch of people pre-order Rocketo, that'll make sure that that comic book store owner will be sure to buy it from Diamond, which will get, which is, that is what really counts when giving money to the creators of Rocketo, you know?

769
00:56:57,941 --> 00:57:00,879
Speaker 0: So you want to pre-order to make sure that the guys buy it.

770
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:14,680
Speaker 0: Now, my point was, pre-ordering is stupid, because it's a comic book, why should I pre-order it, we already said that, but the only reason that pre-ordering is necessary is because of this stupid direct Diamond distribution, you know, business model.

771
00:57:15,261 --> 00:57:29,819
Speaker 0: If you throw the stupid business model away of Diamond distributing to boutique comic book stores, we don't have to do this stupid pre-ordering, every comic will be in every freakin' store, the same way every magazine is in every freakin' store, and everything will be terrific.

772
00:57:31,302 --> 00:57:33,459
Speaker 0: And they didn't really say much to that, they were just kind of like, uhh.

773
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:44,258
Speaker 1: Well I guess, since we've gone long again, we've gone long all week, it seems like this is just complaining week, you know, it's a themed week, we've complained about things all week.

774
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:45,400
Speaker 0: But also learning.

775
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:47,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, learning and complaining.

776
00:57:47,502 --> 00:57:47,566
Speaker 1: Yep.

777
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,520
Speaker 0: You learn something, because you learn an ugly truth, and then you complain about it.

778
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,879
Speaker 1: So what have we learned this week?

779
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,740
Speaker 1: Monday we learned about Listal, and then I complained about how it doesn't do some things.

780
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,240
Speaker 1: Tuesday we complained about the Penny Arcade game.

781
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:03,680
Speaker 1: Today we complained about comics and the New York Comic Con.

782
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,180
Speaker 1: Tomorrow we're going to complain about Hollywood.

783
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:06,807
Speaker 0: Great.

784
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:18,359
Speaker 1: Now, the only reason, we came up with this idea out of the blue, and we're not gonna talk about Hollywood or bad movies as in awesome bad movies like, you know, Hard Rock Zombies or SARS Wars.

785
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,840
Speaker 0: Or the terrible thing from space, oooh, it's a bit, you know.

786
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:28,839
Speaker 1: We're talking about Garfield, Kangaroo Jack, and the reason this all came up is because crappy teen movie number three?

787
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,499
Speaker 1: Snakes on a Plane.

788
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:31,838
Speaker 0: Snakes?

789
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,780
Speaker 1: Motherfuckin' Snakes on a Plane.

790
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,540
Speaker 0: As in, ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.

791
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,700
Speaker 0: Planes flying in the air?

792
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:41,392
Speaker 1: Yeah.

793
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,576
Speaker 0: Uh... So what, did the snakes get chopped up in the propellers or they get sucked into the jet engines?

794
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,620
Speaker 1: They're just on the plane, and Samuel L. Jackson has to stop them.

795
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,120
Speaker 0: Does he have a... he better have a long stick with a spiky bit at the end.

796
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,960
Speaker 1: He better have a Chuck Norris on the end of a rope.

797
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,037
Speaker 0: That'd be a good one.

798
00:58:58,741 --> 00:59:00,340
Speaker 0: And Indiana Jones wouldn't do it for you.

799
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:04,026
Speaker 1: So stay tuned tomorrow if you want to hear us complain for one more day.
