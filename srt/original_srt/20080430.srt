1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,368
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, April 30th.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,251
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:12,913
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,277
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:20,027
Speaker 0: Tonight, Eska, Blo, Nay, Dun, Dun, Dun, Dun.

6
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:26,920
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,584
Speaker 1: So yesterday we talked a bit about how we had Mario Kart Wii and how we were worried about some things.

8
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:46,605
Speaker 1: And I would just like to point out in case anyone says anything that today, when I got home from work, we started it up and immediately discovered the menu that lets us change everything.

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,513
Speaker 1: So now we now race with no A.I.

10
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:51,022
Speaker 1: and pretty much no catch up items.

11
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:51,484
Speaker 0: Yeah.

12
00:00:51,645 --> 00:01:00,937
Speaker 0: And even though the single player in Mario Kart Wii is pretty much just a practice to build up your skills combined with the unlocking bullshit.

13
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,406
Speaker 1: Everyone said it was annoying rubber band A.I.

14
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:05,754
Speaker 1: and I'd expected annoying rubber band A.I.

15
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,027
Speaker 1: I was unprepared for how annoying it was.

16
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:17,882
Speaker 0: It's pretty annoying, but basically the single player exists only to build your skills and to also unlock all the bullshit, which should be unlocked from the beginning.

17
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:20,754
Speaker 0: And the multiplayer is where the real game is at.

18
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:26,360
Speaker 0: And the multiplayer, I must say, is excellent day, as long as you change the rules to turn off the bullshit.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,724
Speaker 0: Mighty fine.

20
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:28,968
Speaker 0: And I beat Rim.

21
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,657
Speaker 0: I was using the wheel and he was using the nunchuck.

22
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,993
Speaker 0: So that's like if I beat him in a foot race wearing a ball and chain.

23
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:39,074
Speaker 1: Well, maybe except for the fact that one, you couldn't beat me in one hundred and fifty CC.

24
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:40,822
Speaker 0: I don't think the wheel can do a hundred.

25
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:41,525
Speaker 0: Yeah.

26
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:45,157
Speaker 1: And do I have played the game maybe ten minutes total.

27
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:51,228
Speaker 0: See, beating you with the wheel at one hundred and fifty CC would be like beating you in a foot race wearing a ball and chain uphill.

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,494
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

29
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,863
Speaker 1: We'll see, because downhill actually might be an advantage.

30
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:55,626
Speaker 0: It is.

31
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,389
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

32
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,737
Speaker 0: All right.

33
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:00,001
Speaker 0: The analogy breaks down.

34
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:00,302
Speaker 0: All right.

35
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,076
Speaker 0: So you got any other stuff to talk about?

36
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:04,758
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday.

37
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,421
Speaker 1: It's anime day.

38
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,245
Speaker 1: There's as usual.

39
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,371
Speaker 1: There's not like there's that much.

40
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:08,316
Speaker 0: Oh, I was gonna.

41
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:09,943
Speaker 0: I was gonna watch an anime today.

42
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,780
Speaker 1: Oh, because I've been kind of busting your balls about watching anime.

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,278
Speaker 1: So I was being the number one anime podcast in the English speaking world.

44
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,912
Speaker 1: We kind of got to got to get on this and talk about some anime.

45
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:23,999
Speaker 0: So I was going to watch the Kazu No Yojimbo DVD, even though I watched the first four episodes of the show a long time ago.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,643
Speaker 1: You know what?

47
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:25,287
Speaker 1: I thought that, too.

48
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:28,805
Speaker 1: And I was like, all right, I'll just skim through the first DVD and then send it back.

49
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:34,083
Speaker 1: And then the first episode started and I didn't remember any of that.

50
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,232
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything in the show whatsoever.

51
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:40,108
Speaker 0: I remember that it's a story about a stranger comes to town.

52
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,916
Speaker 0: It's that's all I remember.

53
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:42,880
Speaker 1: It's Fistful of Dollars.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,862
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's well, I know Fistful of Dollars in terms of throwing rock than paper twice.

55
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,794
Speaker 1: I still you know, that's really all you know.

56
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:51,757
Speaker 0: That's all I know.

57
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:53,565
Speaker 1: God Fistful of Dollars is kind of awesome.

58
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:54,148
Speaker 1: You should look it up.

59
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:57,384
Speaker 1: But anyway, the other thing is I got to look up.

60
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,088
Speaker 1: I keep forgetting.

61
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:58,550
Speaker 0: Finish it.

62
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:05,115
Speaker 1: I was saying I kind of suspect that the character designer is the same person from Gundam 00.

63
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:05,457
Speaker 0: Check it.

64
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:09,214
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I was going to watch Kazu no Yojimbo on the train on my laptop.

65
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:09,495
Speaker 0: Right.

66
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,684
Speaker 0: I even brought I remember to bring my optical drive.

67
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,290
Speaker 0: I brought the Netflix DVD.

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,293
Speaker 0: I was all set.

69
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:15,618
Speaker 0: I forgot.

70
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:23,522
Speaker 0: I had recently, though, upgraded to the new Hardy Heron Ubuntu and I had not installed the new DVD playing software.

71
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,827
Speaker 1: Ah, CSS.

72
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,842
Speaker 0: So I couldn't play the DVD and I didn't have an internet connection on the train.

73
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:36,307
Speaker 1: And well, I guess tomorrow, you know, you could have just written some sort of D.C.S.S Oh, yes.

74
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:37,791
Speaker 0: Because I remember the prime number.

75
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:41,261
Speaker 0: You know, it would have been funny.

76
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:42,366
Speaker 1: What if you'd been wearing the shirt?

77
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,083
Speaker 0: If I was wearing the shirt, then, yes, I could have done it.

78
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,496
Speaker 0: But even though, you know, even writing a D.C.S.S.

79
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:54,193
Speaker 0: right now, I would have to rip the DVD, run it through the D.C.S.S.

80
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,913
Speaker 0: and then just it would have taken my CPU and laptop not powerful enough to.

81
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:02,069
Speaker 0: you would have taken by the time it was done, I would have been off the train, basically.

82
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:02,552
Speaker 1: Yeah.

83
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:02,773
Speaker 1: Yeah.

84
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:03,719
Speaker 1: But it's fun to think about.

85
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,293
Speaker 1: Plus what if the train got stuck, you know, 41 hours?

86
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:17,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got to admit, I'm saddened by the fact that the Internet has made a million kind of parodies of that guy stuck in an elevator video and they're all awful.

87
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:25,147
Speaker 1: I had the pleasure of watching the first 10 seconds of stuck in an elevator for 41 hours with diarrhea.

88
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

89
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,073
Speaker 1: But someone made that whole video.

90
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:33,185
Speaker 0: It's going to be next week.

91
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:37,863
Speaker 0: So between now and next week, I'm going to be watching some animes for a week.

92
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:39,570
Speaker 0: That should give us some anime shows to do.

93
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,835
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

94
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:44,694
Speaker 1: Actually, after we watch some more Casa, no, you Jimbo, I think you've got to watch some Boca.

95
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:45,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

96
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,623
Speaker 0: I watched a bunch of.

97
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:47,407
Speaker 0: I just didn't finish it.

98
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,151
Speaker 1: Got to finish it.

99
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:49,658
Speaker 1: Can't talk about it.

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,388
Speaker 0: I was totally liking that show.

101
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:52,234
Speaker 0: That's my kind of show.

102
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:55,310
Speaker 1: Well, if you were liking it from what you'd seen, you'd like it a lot more.

103
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,640
Speaker 1: Pretty much right after you stop watching.

104
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,310
Speaker 0: My only problem with that show is that I have met knowledge that the man that it is that diverges from the manga that I've never read.

105
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:04,913
Speaker 0: You know what?

106
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:05,636
Speaker 1: I'll say this.

107
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:12,067
Speaker 1: The divergence that we'd heard about was that the person doing the anime wondered if they could get away with killing fewer children.

108
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:12,489
Speaker 0: Yeah.

109
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,276
Speaker 0: And I kind of want to read them.

110
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:23,192
Speaker 0: It makes me think, though, that, like, even if the show is great, it makes me really want the manga and think that the manga is better, even though it might not be.

111
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:25,902
Speaker 1: So apparently you're a you're pro children killing.

112
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,710
Speaker 0: I'm pro children dying.

113
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,975
Speaker 0: Children killing robot story.

114
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:43,063
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, if the anime was the kind of lightened, less sad, less hardcore version, I can't imagine what's in that manga.

115
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:43,524
Speaker 0: I know.

116
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:43,825
Speaker 0: Right.

117
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,430
Speaker 1: Good God.

118
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,807
Speaker 1: I cried like four times throughout the last five episodes of Boca.

119
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:56,167
Speaker 1: Anyway, I started crying at the end of almost every episode because they kill a kid like every episode.

120
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:56,729
Speaker 1: Good God.

121
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,269
Speaker 0: OK, so I'm going to instead of a news because there is no news really.

122
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:01,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is.

123
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:05,712
Speaker 1: There's there's news that people are probably screaming about the fact that we haven't talked about.

124
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,782
Speaker 1: Maybe I can do my news quick.

125
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:08,566
Speaker 0: You want to do your news?

126
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:10,153
Speaker 1: I have a lot to say about it.

127
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:14,069
Speaker 1: But at the New York Comic Con, there was one kind of important announcement.

128
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:22,537
Speaker 1: A lot of people were lamenting the fact that in all the anime industry problems, Gurren Lagann, the TV was not.

129
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,015
Speaker 1: it just kind of fell off the license truck and no one had picked it back up.

130
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:30,550
Speaker 0: Well, well, ATV ran into that problem with that company or whatever.

131
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,103
Speaker 0: They lost a bunch of shows and everything was getting weird.

132
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:41,066
Speaker 1: Well, it just so happens that Gurren Lagann has been picked back up really by Bandai Entertainment.

133
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:43,996
Speaker 0: Oh, see, that's kind of surprising.

134
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,243
Speaker 0: So that definitely see anime companies.

135
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:47,006
Speaker 0: So hush hush.

136
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:47,267
Speaker 0: Right.

137
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:52,967
Speaker 0: But that basically confirms ATV lost the license completely and Bandai bought it.

138
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:59,189
Speaker 1: I'll admit, I'm sure Dave and Joel are going to cry about this and Daryl Surratt and all those people.

139
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,461
Speaker 1: But I have not seen even a second of this show.

140
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:08,344
Speaker 1: And while I've heard a lot about it until now, when I went to the anime news network and I see this picture.

141
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:12,602
Speaker 1: that's obviously from it, I didn't even know what it was about or what it looked like.

142
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:14,910
Speaker 0: I knew it was a robot show by Gainax, right?

143
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,198
Speaker 0: I just it is.

144
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,965
Speaker 0: It's a Gainax robot show, right?

145
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:20,713
Speaker 1: It's a robot show by Gainax.

146
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:21,175
Speaker 0: Right.

147
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:30,432
Speaker 0: Because there was that other like clamp robot show that was pretty recent and I was getting the two shows confused because this one's Tenga, Toppen, Gurren Lagann, right?

148
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:30,894
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:31,677
Speaker 0: What was the other one?

150
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:31,958
Speaker 0: I forget.

151
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,196
Speaker 1: It's weird how we watch so much anime because I didn't watch either one.

152
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:40,089
Speaker 1: So I don't know how this show slipped under my radar.

153
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,902
Speaker 1: I just kept having other things to watch and other things to do.

154
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,709
Speaker 1: And everyone's saying it's great.

155
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:45,713
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

156
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,923
Speaker 1: Well, probably watch it at some point.

157
00:07:48,104 --> 00:07:49,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll definitely watch at some point.

158
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:55,731
Speaker 0: I just want to point out, though, that that what you lost your train of thought.

159
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,353
Speaker 1: It's gone.

160
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:57,116
Speaker 0: I got it.

161
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:57,417
Speaker 0: OK.

162
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,099
Speaker 0: Bandai Entertainment.

163
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:58,982
Speaker 0: Right.

164
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,027
Speaker 0: Well, a lot.

165
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,679
Speaker 0: You know, Bandai Entertainment, first of all, is not Bandai Visual.

166
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,603
Speaker 0: Bandai Visual sucks.

167
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:04,024
Speaker 0: Right.

168
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:13,118
Speaker 0: But actually, I guess this sort of does hold for Bandai Visual, too, in that many things about Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual do not please me.

169
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:13,820
Speaker 0: Right.

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,695
Speaker 0: But over the history of all anime production in the

171
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:20,116
Speaker 0: U.S.,

172
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:22,344
Speaker 0: well, not production, but anime distribution in the

173
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:22,866
Speaker 0: U.S.,

174
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:25,416
Speaker 0: Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual.

175
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:31,054
Speaker 0: for all their failings, they consistently have the best selection of titles.

176
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:36,494
Speaker 0: If you were to pick, you know, if you were to tell me that I could get one free anime series.

177
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:36,855
Speaker 0: Right.

178
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:38,842
Speaker 0: But I had to pick the U.S.

179
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,916
Speaker 0: distributor and then one of their titles would be given to me for free.

180
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:57,335
Speaker 1: I would pick Bandai Entertainment every time because they're the greatest odds of getting a good show, especially because I remember back in like the late 90s, early 2000s, if you thought of a good anime, you always remember that Bandai logo right before it.

181
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:57,958
Speaker 0: Yep.

182
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:58,379
Speaker 0: Yep.

183
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:59,323
Speaker 0: That emotion thing.

184
00:08:59,564 --> 00:08:59,825
Speaker 1: Yeah.

185
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:00,648
Speaker 1: All that business.

186
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,190
Speaker 1: Yeah.

187
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,238
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's all I got.

188
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,062
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the show.

189
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:05,411
Speaker 1: I can't say anything about it.

190
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,905
Speaker 1: I guess you should listen to Dave and Joel if you want to hear about that show.

191
00:09:08,568 --> 00:09:09,392
Speaker 0: Oh, why can't I find.

192
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:09,774
Speaker 0: All right.

193
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:10,779
Speaker 0: Code Geass was.

194
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,547
Speaker 0: that was the show that I always got.

195
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,455
Speaker 1: I've heard that was pretty bad.

196
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:14,676
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:09:14,716 --> 00:09:17,025
Speaker 0: Code Geass is the new clamp robot show.

198
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:21,360
Speaker 0: And tank of top and girl and Lagan is the guy next robot show.

199
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,564
Speaker 0: And I think I did watch the first episode of Code Geass, even though I completely forget it entirely.

200
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:26,227
Speaker 0: Why?

201
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:27,815
Speaker 0: I don't know, because it was a new show.

202
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,201
Speaker 0: I watched, you know, the one episode.

203
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:29,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.

204
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:36,932
Speaker 0: But because I had the shows confused for so long, I think I put off the Lagan thinking it was the other one.

205
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,359
Speaker 0: And now now I've got it sorted out.

206
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,690
Speaker 0: Just now, as I recorded the show, I sorted it out.

207
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:42,593
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

208
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,045
Speaker 1: So you watch a show that you thought was Lagan, but wasn't.

209
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:52,387
Speaker 1: And then when you saw Lagan, you assumed that it was the show you'd already watched.

210
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:53,311
Speaker 0: No, that's not true.

211
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:58,388
Speaker 0: What had happened is I saw a show Code Geass, Lelouch de rebellion, right?

212
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:03,826
Speaker 0: Later, I saw that there was a new robot show called Tank of Top and Girl and Lagan.

213
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:09,005
Speaker 0: And I had thought that I'm like, oh, I seen that show when I hadn't seen it.

214
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:18,861
Speaker 0: I thought that, you know, because the names I got, even though the names aren't similar at all, at all, they're sort of complex, kind of crazy names for robot shows.

215
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:19,927
Speaker 0: There are too many robot shows.

216
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:21,898
Speaker 0: So I thought they were the same show.

217
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,163
Speaker 0: You know, I was confused.

218
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:25,934
Speaker 0: But now it's not like great as I'm recording this.

219
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:34,118
Speaker 0: My confusion has been cleared and now I will be swiftly corrected in possibly the in the coming weeks.

220
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:36,749
Speaker 0: watching of girl and Lagan, at least some episodes.

221
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,412
Speaker 1: All right.

222
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:41,571
Speaker 1: So obviously, because you were complaining about the lack of news, you don't have a news.

223
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:42,918
Speaker 0: I don't have news.

224
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:43,641
Speaker 1: What do you got?

225
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:45,427
Speaker 0: I got a geek back.

226
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:46,330
Speaker 0: Geek bite.

227
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,831
Speaker 0: God damn it.

228
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,754
Speaker 1: You're bad at this.

229
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,617
Speaker 0: I'm real bad.

230
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,183
Speaker 0: I got a geek bite.

231
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:50,444
Speaker 0: Right.

232
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:55,064
Speaker 0: So I go and I try to look at what comics I've read recently, you know, try to pick something out there.

233
00:10:55,747 --> 00:11:04,153
Speaker 0: And I was looking and nothing really felt like a like a real strong geek bite candidate until I saw Orion.

234
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,400
Speaker 1: Now, did you read all of Orion?

235
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:08,263
Speaker 0: What is what do you?

236
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:08,584
Speaker 0: what do you?

237
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,089
Speaker 0: what's the definition of read?

238
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:17,254
Speaker 1: Because I'll admit there are certain moments where a shirotasm will kind of overcome me.

239
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:26,768
Speaker 1: Oh, and I'll realize that I've been flipping pages for like five pages, looking at pictures in the back, glossing over words in the back of the book.

240
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:31,228
Speaker 0: There's a dictionary and author's notes, which would probably be very helpful if I read it.

241
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,172
Speaker 0: But I did not read that.

242
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:32,734
Speaker 1: Wait.

243
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:41,587
Speaker 1: So he at least he made a dictionary and author's notes, not like the other Ghost in the Shell manga, where the ramblings were just kind of all over the pages.

244
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,630
Speaker 0: Right.

245
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,585
Speaker 0: So Masamune, Shiro, Shiro Masamune, the guy who did Ghost in the Shell.

246
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:48,128
Speaker 0: Right.

247
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:51,140
Speaker 0: That guy, the guy sort of famous manga guy.

248
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:51,561
Speaker 0: Right.

249
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,649
Speaker 0: This is one of his manga.

250
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,837
Speaker 0: It's all in one book from Dark Horse.

251
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:57,002
Speaker 0: It's eighteen dollars.

252
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:58,548
Speaker 0: I didn't pay eighteen dollars, thankfully.

253
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,259
Speaker 0: And I got to say this about Shiro.

254
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:02,142
Speaker 0: Right.

255
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,888
Speaker 1: He is Shirotastic.

256
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,613
Speaker 0: Well, Ghost in the Shell is awesome.

257
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:06,556
Speaker 0: Super awesome.

258
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:06,917
Speaker 0: Right.

259
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,552
Speaker 0: And for some reason, I keep buying all of his other works.

260
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:11,676
Speaker 0: I buy the Appleseed.

261
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,123
Speaker 0: I buy the Tank Police.

262
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,609
Speaker 0: I buy the Orion.

263
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,955
Speaker 1: Tank Police is awesome.

264
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,718
Speaker 0: Tank Police is awesome.

265
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:17,863
Speaker 1: Appleseed pretty hot.

266
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:18,224
Speaker 1: Right.

267
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,308
Speaker 0: Appleseed is OK.

268
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,999
Speaker 1: Well, the Appleseed movie was really good.

269
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

270
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,024
Speaker 0: And I buy all his manga.

271
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:31,448
Speaker 0: Thing is, most of his manga are kind of just crazy and don't make sense and aren't really that.

272
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,559
Speaker 1: No, no, we're not talking on the Trigun level.

273
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:34,542
Speaker 1: It's no Naito.

274
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:38,756
Speaker 0: No, it's definitely not on the Trigun level of not making.

275
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:42,329
Speaker 1: I mean, there's I guess there's two kinds of not making sense in a manga.

276
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,901
Speaker 1: There's the Naito Trigun of you flip pages and wonder if pages were missing and can't tell what characters are involved in a scene.

277
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:57,891
Speaker 1: And then there's the Shiro where there'll be a picture of a tank and this vomit of words around the tank on the page.

278
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:04,426
Speaker 1: And some of the words are talking about how we didn't draw the blah, blah, blah on the tank because he didn't think it would look good, but he knows they have to be there.

279
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:15,869
Speaker 1: And then the rest of it is complaining about, like some military political issue in Japan in the future, but not in the future of the manga you're reading, just at some other year.

280
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,399
Speaker 1: And it has nothing to do with the comic at all.

281
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:23,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Orion, basically the deal with Orion is this.

282
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:29,140
Speaker 0: I'm going to, instead of, you know, Shiro usually likes to go off about science and technology and all that.

283
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, or military stuff, right?

284
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,851
Speaker 0: Or something like that, right?

285
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:46,058
Speaker 0: In Orion, he basically makes up this universe where it's all like supernatural fantasy of gods and demons and snakes and monsters and...

286
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:46,705
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

287
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,159
Speaker 1: Gods, demons, monsters.

288
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,138
Speaker 0: Evil witches and magic and...

289
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Speaker 1: Okay, gods, demons, monsters, evil witches, magic, snakes.

290
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, snakes.

291
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Speaker 1: Snakes aren't that special in and of themselves.

292
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,252
Speaker 0: Well, no, I think they're big, magical sort of dragons.

293
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:06,000
Speaker 0: They keep talking about like nagas and things and, you know, this sort of crazy stuff.

294
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,320
Speaker 1: Not just, I picture like a wizard and a dragon and a Godzilla and then a snake.

295
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,541
Speaker 0: No, this is a semi-Watchmen spoiler, but there are scenes reminiscent of the ending of Watchmen in here.

296
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:24,802
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's basically, it's just really fucked up and he can't tell what's going on.

297
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:28,876
Speaker 0: It's like he's just making up like this fantasy shit as he goes along.

298
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:40,557
Speaker 0: And there's a few cute parts, I guess, where like someone gets randomly, like this one scene where you see the girl talking to like these cute aliens, they're sort of octopus-ish, right?

299
00:14:41,099 --> 00:15:18,792
Speaker 0: And the next scene, like she turns someone into one of the cute aliens and it's like hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.

300
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,472
Speaker 0: and you know it's like a kingdom or something.

301
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:37,875
Speaker 0: and then like this demon guy comes out and there's gonna be some sort of apocalypse or something.

302
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:38,317
Speaker 0: maybe.

303
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:43,379
Speaker 0: and you know there people are trying to like set up these crazy magic spells.

304
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:52,243
Speaker 0: they're gonna make good or bad things happen or like all the evil in the world or all the good in the world is gonna come spilling in or out in some direction or something.

305
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:56,856
Speaker 0: and there's all kinds of made-up words all over the place.

306
00:15:56,936 --> 00:16:01,294
Speaker 1: and now is this proper noun gobbledygook or just shirotasm.

307
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:04,265
Speaker 0: okay you ready I'm gonna read I'm gonna read some.

308
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,352
Speaker 0: some random speech bubbles you ready.

309
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,081
Speaker 0: okay naga system I'm ready.

310
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,032
Speaker 0: once you activate I'll fry you with an octo trigram.

311
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:14,762
Speaker 1: that makes perfect sense.

312
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:25,586
Speaker 0: it's an aqua loco type with a twisted hydro element an incredibly powerful Vajra naga force on this planet in 64 harmonics it'll reach threshold that everything will disintegrate.

313
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,198
Speaker 1: all right I I feel really bad.

314
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:29,424
Speaker 1: now you want to know why.

315
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:32,919
Speaker 1: when I read ghost in the shell he would say it's the same.

316
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,524
Speaker 1: it's like jabberwocky where you all the all the structure makes sense but the words don't mean anything.

317
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:47,890
Speaker 1: but in ghost in the shell when you read some of those words you think your brain says oh that was some sciency technical thing and I understand it and you know what.

318
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:52,212
Speaker 1: your brain just lying to you because it makes no more sense than what that just sounded like.

319
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,302
Speaker 1: that just used more fake words.

320
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,430
Speaker 0: okay I'm gonna read four bubbles.

321
00:16:56,792 --> 00:17:03,025
Speaker 0: it's a dialogue between two characters character a then character B then character a then character B again right and that's all.

322
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,696
Speaker 0: that's how I'm gonna end this little geek bite.

323
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,906
Speaker 0: okay ready character a baby.

324
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,532
Speaker 0: he's a deep demon guy who was summoned.

325
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:14,824
Speaker 0: perhaps in another 200 Sykes or so we'll see a sorcerer's shell created that can truly discriminate between good and evil.

326
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:26,815
Speaker 0: character B. and when that time comes human spirits filled with good shall become deities ape spirits shall assume human form and human spirits tainted with bad karma shall remain human asterisk.

327
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,972
Speaker 0: there is a Buddha nature for each level of the soul.

328
00:17:30,012 --> 00:17:33,453
Speaker 0: there are infinite levels of the soul and infinite numbers of corresponding Buddha natures.

329
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:37,656
Speaker 0: the spiritual hierarchy further subdivides the levels existing between apes men and gods.

330
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,047
Speaker 0: the physical body is only a manifestation of the spirit.

331
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,185
Speaker 0: character a again the human form is not the human soul.

332
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:46,055
Speaker 0: its eyes merely see what is transient.

333
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:52,866
Speaker 0: its ears do not hear the voice of the true spirit its words do not state the truth and its mind is ruled by karma.

334
00:17:53,708 --> 00:18:01,201
Speaker 0: character B if psychoscience can weaken the barriers to the physical form words in mind it may become a legitimate method of reaching the truth.

335
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:06,879
Speaker 0: it's just a bunch of made-up talk that's really complicated.

336
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:07,782
Speaker 0: it makes no sense.

337
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:12,454
Speaker 0: and I'm picking random pages people random pages.

338
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:15,184
Speaker 0: I did not prepare this at all.

339
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:21,412
Speaker 0: I opened the book and flipped around looking for speech bubbles with lots of words and they were not hard to find.

340
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:24,725
Speaker 0: don't buy this unless you really hate yourself.

341
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:26,837
Speaker 1: you could have a contest and give it to someone.

342
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:27,802
Speaker 0: no I want to keep us.

343
00:18:27,822 --> 00:18:29,068
Speaker 0: I have the whole shiro collection.

344
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,802
Speaker 1: what are you gonna do with that?

345
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,770
Speaker 0: give the whole thing to somebody.

346
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:45,335
Speaker 1: Wow on the condition it's kind of like those clauses in some sort of Don Knotts movie where you can have the mansion in the fortune if you spend the night in the haunted house.

347
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:48,021
Speaker 1: good one you can have Shiro's manga.

348
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:59,817
Speaker 1: if you read it it's getting down.

349
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,981
Speaker 1: oh god it's things of the day.

350
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:11,126
Speaker 1: I'm sure many of you have seen this but I'm also sure just judging from conversations I've had with our listeners in the past that many of you are not familiar with this.

351
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:15,889
Speaker 1: now you're an anime con today and there's always the kind of fan parodies.

352
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,218
Speaker 0: well actually a lot of anime cons don't have them.

353
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,747
Speaker 0: it's sort of you know it was.

354
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:27,947
Speaker 0: it was a lot more popular I think like a few years ago like one or two and it's sort of spayed it a little bit you know but it was pretty big for a time.

355
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:40,162
Speaker 1: well I guess the really big cons always have them in some capacity and even though actually a lot of the kinds of things that used to be fan parodies are now just in anime music videos straight up or kind of put into that realm.

356
00:19:40,202 --> 00:19:44,139
Speaker 1: but yeah a long time ago I think it was called like otaku.

357
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,546
Speaker 1: this is otaku to them or something.

358
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,392
Speaker 0: yes that was it.

359
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:48,282
Speaker 0: I was gonna ask what the name of that thing was.

360
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:52,541
Speaker 0: we rented it from the anime club library and VHS and watch it as a group.

361
00:19:52,922 --> 00:20:09,302
Speaker 1: yeah this was one of the earlier known to American fans fanfare is one of them more widely distributed early fan pair we were able to get our hands on because in like 2000 2001 times yeah but most people hadn't seen anything like that before.

362
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:11,613
Speaker 1: and then this kind of made the rounds.

363
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,368
Speaker 1: and then there was this surge for a couple years of everyone going.

364
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:15,475
Speaker 1: oh my god fan parody.

365
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:17,246
Speaker 0: I remember we watched this is otaku them.

366
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,394
Speaker 0: it's like a group and it would.

367
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,722
Speaker 0: for some reason it was hilarious.

368
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:26,005
Speaker 1: it was utterly hilarious but in reality look I watched it again a couple years ago lame.

369
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,450
Speaker 0: so so lame.

370
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:33,432
Speaker 1: I wanted to have because I've seen in my life a grand total of three fan parodies.

371
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:34,998
Speaker 0: I've seen one and a half.

372
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,670
Speaker 1: this is otaku them which is you know what it is.

373
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,700
Speaker 1: it kind of started it funny to watch in a group if you're not into anime enough to know a lot about it and you're not.

374
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:54,854
Speaker 0: because remember if you're sort of like a young naive punk kid with a bunch of naive punk kid friends like a high school anime club or freshman in a college anime club this will freaking knock your socks off.

375
00:20:54,914 --> 00:21:01,662
Speaker 1: but remember this is from an era before YouTube back when anime hell and things like that worked a lot better.

376
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:06,220
Speaker 1: nowadays you've seen things like this already times a thousand yep.

377
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:12,848
Speaker 1: but the other two that I've seen and that made a big splash back in the day were Nescaflowne.

378
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:13,751
Speaker 0: I didn't see that one.

379
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,140
Speaker 1: it's not online I can't find it easily.

380
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,017
Speaker 1: I didn't look for a torrent or anything but they kind of screen it at.

381
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:20,783
Speaker 0: cons is anything like Nescafe.

382
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:33,129
Speaker 1: no Alan anyway I wanted to have a link to that because I wanted to make that my thing of the day since we're talking about tenku no escaflowne tonight but couldn't find it.

383
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:37,601
Speaker 1: so I went with the third the classic redeaf.

384
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:45,859
Speaker 0: ah redeaf now perhaps the most widely famed of the the fan parodies.

385
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,660
Speaker 1: now this is another one of those things where if you saw redeaf at a convention a long time ago and have fond memories of it don't watch my thing of the day.

386
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:55,905
Speaker 1: all you're gonna do is go.

387
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:58,113
Speaker 1: wow that was stupid.

388
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,426
Speaker 1: wow that wasn't funny at all except for the gendo part.

389
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,858
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much the only good part is the.

390
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:13,560
Speaker 1: it's getting down but I don't know there was something about watching this with a whole group of people at a convention and the fact that it was so poorly done.

391
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,330
Speaker 1: I mean the voice acting is super bad.

392
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:17,622
Speaker 1: half the time you can't even tell what people are saying.

393
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:20,152
Speaker 1: misato is called in.

394
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:26,252
Speaker 1: they phoned in the role as in literally the woman playing misato called them and they recorded it.

395
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:30,788
Speaker 1: yep it's it's just it's awful in every regard.

396
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:35,947
Speaker 1: but at the same time this is a piece of anime history and I think it's an anime.

397
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:39,641
Speaker 0: it's a US anime fandom history not not anime history.

398
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:46,987
Speaker 0: anime history would be like you know Miyazaki's notebook you know I think it's a piece of anime history.

399
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:47,710
Speaker 1: this is kind of.

400
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:50,922
Speaker 1: this is what was spawned in America.

401
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,045
Speaker 1: this is the result.

402
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,493
Speaker 1: Japan this is what you caused.

403
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:57,704
Speaker 1: okay it's it's actually kind of funny.

404
00:22:57,745 --> 00:23:05,320
Speaker 1: there is the nice one bit at the end that I actually really like where they kind of point out the stupidity of the end of the show Escaflowne.

405
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,702
Speaker 1: but they're like.

406
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:07,711
Speaker 0: so you mean Evangelion.

407
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:09,520
Speaker 1: yeah yeah I said Escaflowne didn't I?

408
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,062
Speaker 1: yes he does.

409
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:10,525
Speaker 1: they're like.

410
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:11,852
Speaker 1: so you gave him the thing he's like.

411
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:14,002
Speaker 1: yeah you gave him the thing.

412
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:17,192
Speaker 1: oh shit and that's all I got.

413
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,219
Speaker 1: yeah you watch and see.

414
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,200
Speaker 0: if you've never seen this if you've never seen Evangelion though and you watch Redeaf.

415
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:29,381
Speaker 1: it does kind of spoil it yeah but in so far as you know what everybody dies in Escaflowne.

416
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:33,069
Speaker 0: everybody yeah everybody dies in both.

417
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:44,730
Speaker 1: Redeaf is an Evangelion fan parody yes as opposed to Nescaflowne which if anyone can find an online copy and send it my way I would be very happy.

418
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,609
Speaker 0: I'm sure some links to Nescaflowne are coming to us as soon as you push the upload.

419
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:54,155
Speaker 1: I'm sure Nescaflowne is as bad as Redeaf was remembered to be I'm sure but I remember.

420
00:23:54,196 --> 00:24:02,130
Speaker 0: there was a time though where you I had already realized the fan parodies were lame and you were all like oh man I'm gonna go watch the fan parodies.

421
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:03,055
Speaker 1: it's so awesome.

422
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,201
Speaker 1: fan parodies can be awesome.

423
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,493
Speaker 1: there have been some super awesome ones since then.

424
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:09,770
Speaker 1: the thing is I just it's hard to find the good ones.

425
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:15,156
Speaker 0: I just remember that one OdaCon like you were super hyped to go to the fan parodies and I was like hell.

426
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:25,487
Speaker 1: no see I wasn't super hyped and the only reason I didn't go was I was gonna go and then I got hungry and I realized that if I didn't eat right then there was no way I would have eaten before the concert.

427
00:24:25,748 --> 00:24:31,175
Speaker 1: so I totally didn't go to the fan parodies because food at that mall across the street is very important.

428
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:32,139
Speaker 0: it is indeed.

429
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,066
Speaker 0: oh I got to do a thing a day right?

430
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,373
Speaker 1: oh I guess you do okay.

431
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:36,700
Speaker 0: so check this out.

432
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,517
Speaker 0: here's the thing of the day that I cannot vouch for the quality of.

433
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,247
Speaker 1: oh great stellar things of the day tonight.

434
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:46,542
Speaker 0: yeah this is a webcomic right that I have not read.

435
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:47,829
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's good.

436
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,955
Speaker 1: are you linking to it?

437
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:51,831
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's bad because I was really desperate for a thing of the day.

438
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:55,048
Speaker 1: I got like four actually between Emily and I do.

439
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:59,509
Speaker 1: I've learned about three or four new comics some of them webcomics that I really got to read.

440
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:01,720
Speaker 0: but there is evidence once about Viking.

441
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:05,921
Speaker 0: yes there is evidence those to suggest that this webcomic is worth talking about.

442
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,090
Speaker 0: first of all the webcomic right.

443
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,553
Speaker 0: the art is by Paul Duffield who if you look at this art it's pretty high quality arts.

444
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:16,348
Speaker 0: he's sorry he's very good with the colors that I've recognized.

445
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:23,457
Speaker 0: that name no okay the name you should recognize is the writer of this weekly webcomic Warren Ellis.

446
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:24,601
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is.

447
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,022
Speaker 0: he is.

448
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:32,845
Speaker 0: he is the famous writer of non webcomics such as such as such as transmetropolitan.

449
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,312
Speaker 1: I didn't like that at all.

450
00:25:34,472 --> 00:25:35,678
Speaker 0: I don't care if you liked it.

451
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,933
Speaker 1: the point is is that I gained no enjoyment from it.

452
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:43,116
Speaker 1: I remember when Steve had it we were at the shore and he brought all this transmetropolitan.

453
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:49,807
Speaker 1: he's like yeah this is like a great comic and I remember I read like all of it and it's oh my god I didn't like it at all.

454
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,735
Speaker 0: it was just awful.

455
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,702
Speaker 0: he also wrote that fell comic.

456
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:54,526
Speaker 0: did you read that one yet?

457
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,916
Speaker 0: nah no he also wrote planetary.

458
00:25:56,936 --> 00:26:03,042
Speaker 0: he's written a lot of comics but the fell I think is my favorite comic by him is definitely the awesome.

459
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:09,901
Speaker 0: I mean we're gonna talk about that soon because I had the first volume and the second volume I think is pending pretty pretty quickly I'll try to read it.

460
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,572
Speaker 0: yeah it's it's an awesome detective thing.

461
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:12,196
Speaker 0: Emily liked it.

462
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:12,840
Speaker 0: she thought it was.

463
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,288
Speaker 1: I imagine I'll really like it.

464
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,158
Speaker 1: yes I've been watching a lot of anime.

465
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:18,510
Speaker 0: so Warren Ellis is a famous comic writer.

466
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,299
Speaker 0: right whether you like his stuff or not.

467
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,507
Speaker 0: I mean you don't have to like his stuff.

468
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,016
Speaker 0: it's not like say Alan Moore.

469
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:27,610
Speaker 0: we have to like his and he make it a webcomic.

470
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:32,986
Speaker 0: that's free and weekly and it's called freak angels freak angels calm.

471
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:41,182
Speaker 0: there's 11 episodes in each episode is six pages and you just go to the first episode and start reading and it shouldn't take you that long.

472
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:46,160
Speaker 0: I mean they're on episode 11. so what 66 pages to catch up at that?

473
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,892
Speaker 0: shouldn't take you that long to read 66 pages of comics?

474
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:52,408
Speaker 0: that's like three flimsy comic books worth right.

475
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:53,816
Speaker 0: so they've already got one trade.

476
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:57,953
Speaker 0: shouldn't take more than an hour to read through this even if you're slow.

477
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:01,025
Speaker 0: so you know free comic by a real.

478
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:08,787
Speaker 0: you know high quality you know professional comic writer you know that that's thing of the day worthy I say but you haven't read it.

479
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:17,642
Speaker 0: no I yeah.

480
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,490
Speaker 1: and then we talked about redead.

481
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:22,818
Speaker 1: yeah and now that yeah.

482
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,566
Speaker 1: well I think we gotta balance that out.

483
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:26,216
Speaker 0: so you know we don't know you're suing.

484
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:26,860
Speaker 0: this is bad.

485
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,523
Speaker 0: it could be good.

486
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:28,850
Speaker 1: I'm not assuming anything.

487
00:27:29,151 --> 00:27:31,422
Speaker 1: I'm taking an agnostic and unknowing position.

488
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:35,357
Speaker 0: you you do but you associated it with Orion and redead.

489
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:38,574
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that there was a train and the trend might continue.

490
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:39,218
Speaker 1: it might be us.

491
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,002
Speaker 0: I don't see a trend.

492
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,648
Speaker 0: the trend is no it's bad.

493
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,572
Speaker 0: no it's bad.

494
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:43,435
Speaker 0: who knows?

495
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:46,086
Speaker 0: well that's not a pattern.

496
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:55,166
Speaker 0: unless we then talk about two more things that are bad and then one more thing that is questionable then it would be a pattern of bad bad questionable bad bad questionable.

497
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:55,547
Speaker 0: repeat.

498
00:27:55,567 --> 00:28:07,054
Speaker 1: anyway tonight regardless we're gonna talk about one of those kind of big shows but luckily because it's a big show we can't really talk about it in any super deep detail.

499
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:10,429
Speaker 1: partly yes Scott hasn't watched it in a long time.

500
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:12,299
Speaker 0: I've only watched the entire show once.

501
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,028
Speaker 0: that was like more than five years ago.

502
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:16,882
Speaker 1: I'll say this this is a show that I was in 2002.

503
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:21,759
Speaker 1: I believe I have seen all the way through four times and then some.

504
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,366
Speaker 0: I've seen all the way through once.

505
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:24,030
Speaker 1: it's a show.

506
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,150
Speaker 0: I've seen the movie twice and I've seen the first four episodes twice.

507
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,442
Speaker 0: that's includes the time that I saw the whole thing.

508
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:40,788
Speaker 1: well it's a show where despite having seen it four and some times I cried at the end every time and you know when I say a cry because I tried a lot of anime but usually it's like Reaper.

509
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:46,710
Speaker 1: it's like Scott did just finish the Prince of Nothing trilogy.

510
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:49,749
Speaker 0: by the way I'm making all sorts of Prince of Nothing jokes now bitches.

511
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,138
Speaker 1: yeah you're a little late to that.

512
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:51,782
Speaker 1: you know what you're like.

513
00:28:51,822 --> 00:29:01,270
Speaker 1: now though you're like those people who played portal like yesterday and they come to the party and they're like haha the cake is a lie and we're all like haha yeah yeah

514
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,995
Speaker 0: but you know what the difference is is that I'm much more clever and that's I'm making the jokes that no one else makes.

515
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:07,563
Speaker 1: we made the deeper joke.

516
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:08,105
Speaker 0: no you did.

517
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:08,788
Speaker 1: yes we did.

518
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:09,932
Speaker 1: yes we did.

519
00:29:09,952 --> 00:29:12,663
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have to go digging for some deeper jokes.

520
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:16,641
Speaker 0: then cuz they were the Prince of Nothing is a minefield of jokes.

521
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:21,616
Speaker 1: oh my god it is it is it is a no it is not a comedy.

522
00:29:21,856 --> 00:29:24,306
Speaker 1: it is that there is so much in there.

523
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:28,847
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing where you can reference it with other people in very clever way.

524
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:29,711
Speaker 0: it'd be Prince of.

525
00:29:30,112 --> 00:29:42,833
Speaker 0: this is sort of a bad in poor taste but I'm gonna compare it to Cambodia in terms of its humor value it's kind of true and in terms of the you know minefields get it.

526
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,079
Speaker 0: yeah okay that's.

527
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,429
Speaker 0: I know that was in poor taste but I was.

528
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:47,754
Speaker 1: I was thinking more in terms of.

529
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:50,706
Speaker 1: it is not a pleasant fantasy world?

530
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:51,590
Speaker 0: no it is not.

531
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,704
Speaker 0: neither is Cambodia no but I think Cambodia is worse.

532
00:29:56,245 --> 00:29:59,354
Speaker 1: well was at least bad anime.

533
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:05,512
Speaker 1: so tonight we're talking about this show which is nothing like Cambodia.

534
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,157
Speaker 1: tenku no escaflowne.

535
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:09,627
Speaker 1: vision of escaflowne is in my opinion.

536
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:13,524
Speaker 1: now we talk about must-see anime and we talk about good anime and bad anime.

537
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:22,778
Speaker 1: but if there are say three or four or five like greatest anime like TV series well yeah movies we can't really count.

538
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:23,924
Speaker 1: that's this whole separate.

539
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:35,828
Speaker 0: because then you see when you start movies you're like okay she movie every miyazaki movie every stodgy khan movie every you know you start going off and then you're in a mess.

540
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:46,368
Speaker 0: but when you're talking about TV shows at least the TV shows that aren't five zillion episodes and I know a lot of people hate you know making like a top ten or a top five list but escaflowne is in every one of those lists.

541
00:30:46,489 --> 00:30:48,040
Speaker 1: it's gotta be what I would pretty much say.

542
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,700
Speaker 1: the way I would put it is that we kind of classify anime into a B and C anime.

543
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:55,232
Speaker 1: a anime is anime that leaves you with something.

544
00:30:55,252 --> 00:31:07,998
Speaker 1: I mean examples of a anime or cowboy bebop Trigon like the big hitters the amazing shows Gundam seed not destiny clean up batters the star quarterbacks in the Super Bowl.

545
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:12,139
Speaker 1: and then there's be anime which are like I don't know scrap princess konkotsuo.

546
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,681
Speaker 1: they're good they're fun they're really worth watching but they're not like special they don't.

547
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,633
Speaker 1: they're not like the all-time amazing greats.

548
00:31:19,894 --> 00:31:21,824
Speaker 1: you know yeah and see anime are like.

549
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:29,574
Speaker 1: you know initial D and all those things that we like anyway and then F anime are like girl in the gun.

550
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:31,540
Speaker 0: oh no I haven't watched it I can't.

551
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,244
Speaker 1: yeah we can't say.

552
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,300
Speaker 0: I just tried to say something that would incite people going.

553
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,936
Speaker 1: Oh Daryl Surratt for a second was about to call gogo 13.

554
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:40,759
Speaker 0: yeah I know like.

555
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:47,107
Speaker 1: he picked up the phone and then you said just kidding he hesitated for a minute much like speaking of gogo 13.

556
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,652
Speaker 1: Wow so much for escaflowne.

557
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:52,406
Speaker 0: okay so escaflowne right.

558
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:59,155
Speaker 0: the thing about escaflowne that makes it such an a anime right is that first of all you got a fantasy anime.

559
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,164
Speaker 0: pretty rare to have a fantasy anime.

560
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:02,531
Speaker 0: that's not just like a joke right?

561
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:10,083
Speaker 1: I mean what like serious fantasy anime do we have slayers edges into serious territory a little a couple of times right?

562
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:11,608
Speaker 1: there's twelve kingdoms.

563
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,039
Speaker 0: yeah I guess - it's a robot anime.

564
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:22,207
Speaker 0: they're mad robots in escaflowne but it's not a. it's not in the genre of robot show but it has the robots and they're cool.

565
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,177
Speaker 1: it's got pretty boys and cat girls.

566
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,625
Speaker 0: I guess that's it does like.

567
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:32,622
Speaker 0: that does yeah and the thing that's really like defines escaflowne.

568
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:46,684
Speaker 0: the way I sum it up in my mind is that somehow they take like stereotypes of anime like come on schoolgirl in high school transported to a fantasy world.

569
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:56,094
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of pretty boy bunch of pretty boys and cat and a magical war and she falls in love kind of.

570
00:32:56,535 --> 00:33:00,812
Speaker 0: but is that not the most like by-the-book story you've ever heard?

571
00:33:00,832 --> 00:33:08,880
Speaker 0: I don't know what is in terms of anime right but yet yet they pull it off and you don't even realize how cliche it is.

572
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:16,893
Speaker 0: because every cliche is like done with the finesse and the polish that makes it feel like original and new and amazing.

573
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:22,623
Speaker 1: it's one of those shows one of those rare shows where a lot of things try to be epic and there's different ways to look at epic.

574
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:28,068
Speaker 1: I mean you could look at kind of all the leiji Matsumoto works and say like those as a whole are this epic thing.

575
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:41,521
Speaker 1: but watching a show the the way like from where escaflowne starts until where it gets about halfway through and then to where it gets by the end it it is epic in every sense of the word.

576
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:51,155
Speaker 0: the plot is one of those like epic but not forced and I a lot of the plot you can see coming but a lot of it no way gonna see it coming?

577
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:52,722
Speaker 0: not at all not even close.

578
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:55,312
Speaker 1: so escaflowne before.

579
00:33:55,353 --> 00:34:02,283
Speaker 1: I mean just if you'd stop listening to geek nights right now tonight because you got other things to do and you have not seen tenku.

580
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:05,736
Speaker 1: no escaflowne it is your duty to buy it and watch it.

581
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,589
Speaker 1: this is one of the greatest animated series ever.

582
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,137
Speaker 0: yeah it's really cheap too.

583
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,001
Speaker 0: I mean you can probably get.

584
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:18,907
Speaker 0: you can get every all 26 episodes of it in like one box right in the bricks and it shouldn't cost you more than $50.

585
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:19,529
Speaker 0: I paid $23 for it.

586
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:20,011
Speaker 1: Wow best Bob.

587
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:31,130
Speaker 0: Wow 26 episodes for $23 less than a dollar an episode for an entire anime series one of the best ever on DVD.

588
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,498
Speaker 0: I'm looking it up on Amazon right now.

589
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:37,523
Speaker 1: all right but there's actually there's a lot of interesting kind of side stuff about escaflowne.

590
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:40,840
Speaker 1: before we kind of get into what it's about and why it's so great.

591
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,507
Speaker 1: already talked about what it's about yeah but we can talk about that in a little more detail.

592
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,726
Speaker 1: well it's funny how whenever we do a show about a show we like which isn't that often we kind of gush.

593
00:34:51,007 --> 00:35:08,484
Speaker 0: yeah you could walk up to rim like randomly and just say escaflowne I might just cry just like gush onto the floor me not so much all right on Amazon right I see escaflowne anime legends complete collection $45.

594
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:13,279
Speaker 0: that is worth everything that is totally worth it.

595
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,535
Speaker 1: I paid $28 for the first VHS tape of escaflowne.

596
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:20,821
Speaker 0: I see 43 used and new from $26.

597
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:23,770
Speaker 0: so you can get a used set 26 bucks.

598
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,460
Speaker 1: so escaflowne is actually kind of old.

599
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,024
Speaker 1: it's more than a decade old.

600
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:30,909
Speaker 1: this came out in 1996.

601
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:36,527
Speaker 0: oh god it looks like a late 90s early 2000 anime.

602
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:39,800
Speaker 1: yeah yeah but at the same time it was a very high budget.

603
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:42,936
Speaker 1: kind of we're putting all the right things together.

604
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:47,780
Speaker 1: it was one of those shows where you looked at and you knew wow all the right people are behind it.

605
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,724
Speaker 1: all the money's there.

606
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:51,256
Speaker 1: this is gonna be one of those gigantic shows.

607
00:35:51,598 --> 00:36:00,820
Speaker 1: the same way you'd look at cowboy bebop when it was originally kind of being put out and and much like all these great shows back in that era it had a lot of trouble.

608
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,671
Speaker 1: it was almost not made like a bunch of times.

609
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:04,802
Speaker 1: it sat on the shelf for like four years.

610
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:14,360
Speaker 1: there they lost the first director which actually I'm not gonna tell the whole story but to sum it up briefly someone was going to direct escaflowne.

611
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:19,077
Speaker 1: that person was for various reasons not included in the project.

612
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:44,168
Speaker 1: by the end they it's actually kind of complicated but instead of the original director and the original concept someone by the name of Kazuki Akane became the director and made changes to escaflowne to the point that it went from a super run-of-the-mill garbage show into one of the greatest anime ever and I attribute that largely to the changes that were made.

613
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,534
Speaker 1: if you want to see what escaflowne would have likely been like otherwise there are two.

614
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,586
Speaker 1: well there are three but you probably haven't seen the third one.

615
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:52,452
Speaker 1: there are two manga.

616
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:54,584
Speaker 0: yeah that's the thing about escaflowne.

617
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:56,713
Speaker 0: it has two manga which is confusing.

618
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:59,966
Speaker 1: one is a shoujo manga and one is a shonen manga.

619
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:00,990
Speaker 1: they both suck.

620
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:02,717
Speaker 0: they're utter crap.

621
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:07,502
Speaker 0: the shoujo is a little better than the shonen but that's like saying it smells better than poop like.

622
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:11,799
Speaker 1: don't even be tempted to flip through the escaflowne manga.

623
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,546
Speaker 1: this is some bad bad manga.

624
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:17,073
Speaker 0: they're terrible not worth the penny.

625
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:24,016
Speaker 1: but this show just like Evangelion was originally going to be 39 episodes.

626
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:39,717
Speaker 1: this is back when shows were always 26 episodes and this show was gonna be you know three half seasons 39 episodes and unlike utenna instead of stretching out their budget with lots of stock footage and bad animation techniques which I think worked to utenna's benefit.

627
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,106
Speaker 0: yes well but that not for her.

628
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,358
Speaker 0: they wouldn't have worked escaflowne's benefit that's not sure.

629
00:37:43,398 --> 00:37:51,134
Speaker 1: but escaflowne and Evangelion were both originally going to be 39 episodes and due to cuts they had to cut them short to 26 episodes.

630
00:37:51,495 --> 00:37:57,774
Speaker 1: and escaflowne unlike Evangelion did this by not cutting out anything.

631
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,626
Speaker 0: you really can't tell that the show was supposed to be 39 episodes.

632
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:14,094
Speaker 0: if anything I mean like you watch say the original Matt cross TV series right where they tacked on extra episodes at the end and you can totally tell the point at which the original ends and then they begin the tacked on episodes and this.

633
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,264
Speaker 0: they cut episodes out but you can't tell.

634
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:24,201
Speaker 0: it's like it looks like they wrote the whole thing from the beginning knowing is gonna be setting plot out or changing things to make an end in 26.

635
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:30,854
Speaker 1: all they did was kind of tighten it up and save time wherever they could by kind of making the story progress faster and that was good.

636
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:42,450
Speaker 1: and as a result actually I think one of the greatest strengths of escaflowne one of those subtle things is that the show starts and it throws you into it and then it kind of progresses at a steady pace but the kind of.

637
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:46,606
Speaker 1: the rate of progression is accelerating throughout the show.

638
00:38:46,626 --> 00:39:00,133
Speaker 1: so you get through say one plot unit in the first episode and one plot unit in the second episode and 1.1 plot units in the third episode and 1.4 plot units in the fourth episode.

639
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:03,911
Speaker 1: and the show kind of builds up the pace and builds up the pace.

640
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:10,542
Speaker 1: and epic like the epicness is going up and the pace is going up and filler scenes and atmospheric shots are cutting down.

641
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:20,719
Speaker 1: and the last like five or six episodes are this like bullet train to destiny like the show is just at this breakneck pace and things are happening.

642
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,466
Speaker 1: just it bam bam bam bam bam.

643
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:24,775
Speaker 1: and then it stops and it's over.

644
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:25,878
Speaker 1: and it's amazing.

645
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:48,150
Speaker 0: the worst part of escaflowne is there's so many cliffhangers often at the end of DVDs or VHS tapes and they're like the most grueling possible cliffhangers you can imagine like we're talking characters you love on the brink of death major major climaxes in the plot.

646
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,137
Speaker 0: just like left ambiguous.

647
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:52,646
Speaker 1: this show really strings you along.

648
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,257
Speaker 0: it strings you along so badly.

649
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:56,784
Speaker 1: it's kind of like in that regard.

650
00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:14,217
Speaker 1: it's almost like those old Hardy Boys novels the kind of Hardy Boys the New Year's but unlike those it's not terrible like the worst example if you were watching escaflowne and you have you're watching the second to last DVD or tape or whatever you got and you see the fifth to last episode.

651
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:18,390
Speaker 1: make sure you've got the next episode handy cuz.

652
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:18,791
Speaker 1: there's.

653
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,848
Speaker 1: that's the worst cliffhanger at any show I've ever seen.

654
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:25,174
Speaker 0: it's really terrible.

655
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:26,221
Speaker 0: we're talking about the same one.

656
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:31,312
Speaker 0: I think we are the one where actually when we really where all you see is a robot and something's coming out of it.

657
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:32,959
Speaker 1: oh no no there's one worse.

658
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,345
Speaker 0: I think that's the worst one.

659
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:34,445
Speaker 0: well

660
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:41,721
Speaker 1: that while that one was like the second worst cliffhanger ever I think the one near the end where me and Ken got stuck in the elevator

661
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,067
Speaker 0: yeah coming

662
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:43,871
Speaker 1: back with the tape

663
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:46,971
Speaker 0: I think the one with the robot and the stuff coming out of it is the worst one.

664
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:49,565
Speaker 1: I don't even want to say anything about what either.

665
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:53,002
Speaker 0: these cliffhangers I find I found a clever way to say it without spoiling it.

666
00:40:53,646 --> 00:40:56,320
Speaker 0: are you gonna say it robot with stuff coming out of it?

667
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:58,110
Speaker 1: oh I thought you had some other clever way.

668
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,095
Speaker 0: no that was my clever way.

669
00:40:59,116 --> 00:40:59,920
Speaker 1: that kind of works.

670
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,362
Speaker 1: there's.

671
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:04,762
Speaker 1: there's no way to cleverly refer to mine other than other than to just blurt it out.

672
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:08,237
Speaker 0: man that and this is an easily spoiled show.

673
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,282
Speaker 0: that is a problem with it.

674
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:15,815
Speaker 0: well it's easily spoiled in one regard but at the same time a lot of things are kind of obvious to anyone who's actually seen the show.

675
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,624
Speaker 1: so it's it's one of those.

676
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:25,717
Speaker 1: yeah you could spoil it but spoilers don't mean much out of context like the journey is a lot more important than what happened.

677
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:31,101
Speaker 0: yeah yeah other thing about asking flown a is that the characters are pretty awesome.

678
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:32,045
Speaker 0: they're solid.

679
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:33,834
Speaker 1: there are a lot of main characters they're.

680
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:40,469
Speaker 0: all the thing is is like I do you know it doesn't have the simp the problem of a lot of other enemies or the main characters suck.

681
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:45,995
Speaker 0: the side characters are cool but I do think that the side characters are cooler than the main character.

682
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:51,745
Speaker 0: well it depends because it's all right thing is they're not really that far off to the side they're pretty close.

683
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:52,649
Speaker 0: they're just.

684
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:53,192
Speaker 0: you know they're not.

685
00:41:53,273 --> 00:41:54,641
Speaker 0: domain to character.

686
00:41:54,721 --> 00:42:00,330
Speaker 1: yeah well they're also all really three-dimensional and it starts out like the show looks a little stereotypical.

687
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:06,514
Speaker 1: I mean Alan she's are is the pretty boy and he's so cool and I'm gonna think he's so cool.

688
00:42:06,996 --> 00:42:08,663
Speaker 0: but then do you think he's so cool?

689
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:09,788
Speaker 1: course I think he's so cool.

690
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:10,794
Speaker 1: he's the man.

691
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:12,442
Speaker 0: it's just your favorite anime character.

692
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:20,577
Speaker 1: but then as it goes I mean god that's what I. my aim name she's our 105. it wasn't named after Cliff she's our that's for sure.

693
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:30,166
Speaker 1: but then you know as the show progresses and no Alex is our is a sad emotionally broken man who's kind of messed up.

694
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:33,316
Speaker 0: yeah and then you've got like you know Dylan down.

695
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:40,319
Speaker 0: I mean people see you know crazy characters in anime like he's like the crazy psycho killers.

696
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:46,264
Speaker 0: right Dylan Dow is like the perfect execution of the crazy psycho killer.

697
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:47,148
Speaker 0: kind of care I think.

698
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:52,997
Speaker 1: the scene the scene I actually rerun when I was watching this the first time we actually rewind because it was a VHS tape.

699
00:42:53,459 --> 00:43:14,034
Speaker 1: the scene where he got that scar on his face he's freaking out about it for like the rest of the show yeah and he's just sitting there with it like this flask in front of him and he's cutting like scratching this knife against the flask and the scene is just him sitting there kind of scratching this flask and then he suddenly freaks out and breaks it all over himself and screams

700
00:43:15,017 --> 00:43:29,046
Speaker 0: yeah the show that that's really I said it before but escaflowne is all about taking the cliche but executing it in a way where it doesn't seem cliche it's like it makes it work every time

701
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:32,503
Speaker 1: and also right along those lines it takes the cliche.

702
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:36,223
Speaker 1: there's kind of this surface like you can enjoy escaflowne like the cliche of the cat girl.

703
00:43:36,404 --> 00:43:40,485
Speaker 0: but the cat girl isn't bad you're not going all cat girl you're going huh cat girl.

704
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:47,107
Speaker 1: and then when there's the other cat girls yeah it's like cliche the crazy evil bad guy.

705
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,295
Speaker 0: but whoa he's so crazy.

706
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:51,444
Speaker 0: and wow that totally works as a character.

707
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,818
Speaker 0: and you know cliche schoolgirl brought to a fantasy world.

708
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:58,655
Speaker 0: but oh it's done so tastefully and not so shallowly.

709
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:00,223
Speaker 0: ah just like a like a truffle.

710
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:01,791
Speaker 1: but in addition to this ooh a truffle.

711
00:44:02,254 --> 00:44:06,294
Speaker 1: but you look at it from that you can enjoy this show on this surface level this visceral.

712
00:44:06,675 --> 00:44:09,645
Speaker 1: yay let's go fantasy epic adventure this crazy plot.

713
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:17,080
Speaker 1: but and a lot of people go whenever people say things like this well no I mean if you know the thing I'm about to say not the thing I just said.

714
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,623
Speaker 1: no escaflowne is one of those shows that's you know deep and stuff.

715
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:25,256
Speaker 0: it's kind of deep it's not super deep but it's got.

716
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:30,768
Speaker 1: it's got the depth it's got a lot more depth than you'd realize especially in the when you kind of find out what was going on.

717
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:32,598
Speaker 1: and you know a lot of shows have like cool.

718
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:37,384
Speaker 0: if it was a pool it would be deep enough for a high jump but not deep enough for an Olympic high.

719
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:44,268
Speaker 1: well I'll put it this way it's not deep in the big o2 way where they beat you over the head with.

720
00:44:44,288 --> 00:44:46,537
Speaker 1: it's not deep in the existentialist philosophy.

721
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:48,467
Speaker 0: it's not deep in the Orion way.

722
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:51,060
Speaker 1: it's not deep in the ghost in the shell.

723
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,130
Speaker 1: you know social phenomenon and what is the nature?

724
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,275
Speaker 0: just the right depth where you stand on your tippy toes but and you keep your nose out of the water.

725
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:57,718
Speaker 0: well know what.

726
00:44:57,758 --> 00:45:02,284
Speaker 1: what's great about the show is that it doesn't just have kind of one overarching moral.

727
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:06,423
Speaker 1: I mean you've been some evangelical despite all its existentialist.

728
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:07,508
Speaker 0: and try gun as well.

729
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:22,633
Speaker 1: yes try gun is just kind of considering the idea of pacifism and everything in the show is really just kind of around this one idea and as a or evangelical is kind of just around the idea of what our humans and how do we interact with each other and ourselves.

730
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:31,628
Speaker 1: eska flown a has like nine of those issues and yeah it wants them all equally well cuz each character like this side plots.

731
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:32,332
Speaker 0: it's sort of like.

732
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:38,081
Speaker 0: I really related a lot to Final Fantasy 6 where you have like a fantasy world a big epic kind of journey.

733
00:45:38,342 --> 00:45:43,071
Speaker 0: you can actually match up a lot of the characters with Final Fantasy 6 characters being kind of similar you know.

734
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,424
Speaker 1: and oh man I just you said that I thought.

735
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:47,790
Speaker 1: but who would match up with lock?

736
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,171
Speaker 1: that was like or Edward and I was like duh Dryden.

737
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:55,724
Speaker 0: for both of them I think I think Edward.

738
00:45:55,805 --> 00:45:57,108
Speaker 0: now she's our goal together.

739
00:45:57,229 --> 00:45:58,333
Speaker 1: yeah they kind of do.

740
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:01,768
Speaker 1: yeah but I really like Dryden when he's got that mermaid.

741
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:06,186
Speaker 0: yeah all right but yeah you got Kefka for Dylan down.

742
00:46:06,226 --> 00:46:07,552
Speaker 0: it's like you totally it totally works.

743
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:11,771
Speaker 1: well I think Dylan down out crazies Kefka though the only thing cats.

744
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:12,957
Speaker 1: a tough call that Dylan.

745
00:46:12,977 --> 00:46:16,493
Speaker 1: tough call that Kefka murders a lot more people than Dylan.

746
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:20,356
Speaker 0: I can guarantee though if you like Final Fantasy 6 you like eska plonie and vice versa.

747
00:46:20,437 --> 00:46:24,804
Speaker 1: in fact if you're one of those people who always wish the Final Fantasy 6 for an anime just watch eska plonie.

748
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:26,634
Speaker 1: pretty much it's better than that could ever be.

749
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:28,062
Speaker 0: yeah yeah I guess.

750
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,294
Speaker 0: cuz it doesn't have the random encounters it doesn't take as long.

751
00:46:30,918 --> 00:46:34,615
Speaker 1: if you're gonna make a Final Fantasy movie I think the random encounter is the first thing to go.

752
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,206
Speaker 0: but yeah it's really.

753
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:46,684
Speaker 0: it's that kind of thing where even though there is a big major plot like all the characters have their plots and each of their plots is sort of separate.

754
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:48,772
Speaker 0: so it's like as you go through.

755
00:46:48,833 --> 00:47:01,974
Speaker 0: it's like not only are you trying to figure out the big picture but there's the you know the thread of each of the main characters and what their deal is and all their deals come to a head and then the big thing comes to a head and then it's over

756
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:04,432
Speaker 1: and the show doesn't kind of take anything for granted.

757
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:05,357
Speaker 1: like there's the world.

758
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:18,221
Speaker 1: but the world is super super super fleshed out and all the politics and all the people and all the races and all those things are all there and all strong in the background the foreground wherever they matter and it's super consistent with itself.

759
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:27,439
Speaker 1: and as a result you know it's got the cliche of the girl who comes from the other world has some magical powers but they don't just leave it at that.

760
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:40,157
Speaker 1: like a lot of shows she's an esper she's an esper but seriously the show gets into some dark territory in regards to why does Hitomi have these powers?

761
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:42,806
Speaker 1: what are those powers doing?

762
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:47,024
Speaker 1: how are they affecting everything as we've been following this show?

763
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:49,675
Speaker 1: yeah how much can she really control them?

764
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:54,294
Speaker 1: the show really really really is good and that's all we can really say.

765
00:47:54,335 --> 00:47:55,644
Speaker 1: we just keep saying that over and over again.

766
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,915
Speaker 0: now there is an escaflowne a movie.

767
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:05,064
Speaker 0: the movie has some of the same characters as the show a lot of the same characters but different character designs.

768
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:05,728
Speaker 0: actually the

769
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:20,321
Speaker 1: movie is basically take like every character from the show and pick like one element of their personality make that the entire character and then it's like everyone is a deep caricature of a character from the show and

770
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:34,759
Speaker 0: then take sort of the same universe but like a different world like so you know it's like it's the same but it's different and they just sort of tell a story with those characters in like you know 90 minutes or so.

771
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:42,474
Speaker 1: it's kind of like it takes one of the themes of escaflowne and just addresses that like it distills everything to one of its core essences.

772
00:48:42,534 --> 00:48:47,397
Speaker 0: yeah you could watch the movie and it won't spoil shit about the real show and vice versa.

773
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:50,331
Speaker 0: they they really have not not much to do with each other.

774
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:56,079
Speaker 1: besides the characters the movie also was one of those super high-budget super pretty and you know what.

775
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,844
Speaker 0: it's pretty pretty.

776
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,352
Speaker 1: yeah it's a good movie it's not.

777
00:48:58,493 --> 00:48:59,036
Speaker 0: it's okay.

778
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:02,252
Speaker 1: just if you if you don't go into it expecting you don't need to see it.

779
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:08,740
Speaker 1: but if you want to watch it just don't watch one and expect it to be the other one because they're both good.

780
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,499
Speaker 0: if you expect the movie to be like the TV show you're gonna be disappointed.

781
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:17,502
Speaker 1: plus don't forget the escaflowne movie was one of the first widely distributed digital fan subs.

782
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:18,707
Speaker 0: yep it sure was.

783
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,936
Speaker 1: Wow this was a long time ago.

784
00:49:20,996 --> 00:49:22,382
Speaker 1: all of this yeah it was.

785
00:49:22,603 --> 00:49:26,242
Speaker 1: but the story of escaflowne actually it's just that there's this girl.

786
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:26,946
Speaker 1: her name's Hitomi.

787
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:31,325
Speaker 1: she's a normal average girl but she's not an average boring girl.

788
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:34,358
Speaker 1: she's an average you know quirky kind of realistic girl.

789
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:38,780
Speaker 0: yeah and she's in high school and she does track and she has friends who were cool.

790
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:40,228
Speaker 1: yeah she actually has friends.

791
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:41,796
Speaker 1: it's not like the stereotypical.

792
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:47,548
Speaker 0: you know I don't have any friends blah and the friends are sort of normal and they sort of have these real high school problems.

793
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:50,083
Speaker 0: and she likes this boy and there's another boy.

794
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,073
Speaker 0: I think that doesn't really get talked about so much.

795
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,224
Speaker 1: and well there's Amano Senpai.

796
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,233
Speaker 0: right right right that's the guy that she likes.

797
00:49:56,414 --> 00:50:00,992
Speaker 1: yes but one thing leads to another and she gets transported to this world.

798
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:03,221
Speaker 1: but it's not like it's out of the blue it's.

799
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,310
Speaker 1: I can't spoil anything.

800
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,217
Speaker 0: they slowly lean into it.

801
00:50:07,278 --> 00:50:14,930
Speaker 0: like as a watcher as a viewer of the anime you kind of see that Sun's coming and you kind of know because it's a meta thing.

802
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,754
Speaker 0: right you know what.

803
00:50:15,794 --> 00:50:21,360
Speaker 0: but they totally lean into it and it's it feels really natural and not just like poof.

804
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,068
Speaker 0: we're in another world like El Hazzard.

805
00:50:23,108 --> 00:50:28,473
Speaker 0: this show kind of stand out like if El Hazzard is the wow we're just transported to a different world.

806
00:50:28,513 --> 00:50:31,708
Speaker 0: suddenly this is the ah this is the right way to do that.

807
00:50:31,748 --> 00:50:35,303
Speaker 1: even El Hazzard has a whole bunch of school build-up.

808
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:35,946
Speaker 1: it does.

809
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:45,047
Speaker 1: it has that one of my favorites comedy scenes in any show ever where Jedi is in the hallway freaking out as he looks at all the different bulletin board pictures.

810
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:53,098
Speaker 0: this is one thing that amazes me about Escaflowne is how the school the high school aspect of Escaflowne comes on so strong.

811
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:57,813
Speaker 0: yet the amount of screen time it gets is so small.

812
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,664
Speaker 0: but yeah like it's you barely see the school.

813
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:03,997
Speaker 0: but the school is so powerfully in the show.

814
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,086
Speaker 1: well the school also comes back.

815
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:11,090
Speaker 1: this isn't really a spoiler so much because it kind of illustrates an interesting the show.

816
00:51:11,532 --> 00:51:18,083
Speaker 1: there's a point at which they're you know things are going on and they told me is trying to hide somewhere and her pager goes off.

817
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:20,553
Speaker 0: it's totally a Hoshi no koei thing.

818
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:22,058
Speaker 1: her pager goes off

819
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:23,965
Speaker 0: and in the fantasy world

820
00:51:23,986 --> 00:51:34,263
Speaker 1: you know she's got her bag with her she's got CDs and all these things just with her but it goes off and it caused all this trouble and you forget about it going off because whatever it went off and all this action happens.

821
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:42,507
Speaker 1: and then at the end of the episode she's like they've relaxed and they're safe and she just kind of looks at the pager and then she sees the phone number on it and then it

822
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:43,090
Speaker 0: cuts to

823
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:49,490
Speaker 1: the real world again earth and there's a mono and he was just calling the pager.

824
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,197
Speaker 1: and is he there?

825
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:52,502
Speaker 1: he's in a phone booth and that's it.

826
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:57,905
Speaker 0: yeah and the thing is it told me is like for is wearing her school uniform.

827
00:51:57,926 --> 00:52:01,643
Speaker 0: still everyone else is like you know knights and wizards and elves and shit.

828
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:02,688
Speaker 0: so it's like.

829
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,657
Speaker 0: you know that's like her character design.

830
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:06,023
Speaker 0: so it totally makes sense.

831
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:08,334
Speaker 0: but it's sort of it always ties.

832
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:13,440
Speaker 0: she's always carrying her bag of stuff from high school because it was transported to this world with her.

833
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:18,024
Speaker 0: she's wearing sneakers you know so it's like it's always tied back to this school.

834
00:52:18,084 --> 00:52:21,180
Speaker 0: despite that the school gets almost no screen time and it's not.

835
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,392
Speaker 1: I mean it's not just a convenience or whatever.

836
00:52:23,412 --> 00:52:26,367
Speaker 1: it actually kind of matters to the plot and it matters a lot.

837
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:32,157
Speaker 1: it is the plot now but what I was about to say before was that part of what makes this show stand out in terms of.

838
00:52:32,197 --> 00:52:34,029
Speaker 1: you know you said the opening is kind of natural.

839
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:46,395
Speaker 1: like it it draws you into the world and a lot of modern shows seem to just like people have an idea like we're gonna make a show about blah and they introduce blah as quickly as possible and they wrap a little mystery around it to try to dangle you along.

840
00:52:47,178 --> 00:52:50,772
Speaker 1: this show develops so much more naturally than a lot of these shows.

841
00:52:50,812 --> 00:53:02,843
Speaker 1: I feel like modern anime seem to often forget that you have to have a strong come on in the beginning but they come on too strong in the beginning and in the end it makes a weaker come on

842
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:06,344
Speaker 0: or they come on too weak in the beginning because they don't want to reveal too much.

843
00:53:06,364 --> 00:53:14,467
Speaker 1: I think the first episode of this show is one of the best not the best but definitely one of the better introductions to a complex world and a complex show.

844
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:18,268
Speaker 0: I think the reason it works so well is because they come on strong with the school.

845
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:23,412
Speaker 0: they bring you on everything about the school and then the fantasy world and you got nothing.

846
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:29,188
Speaker 0: so they got the mystery is all in the fantasy world but they were able to lure you in with the really strong school revealing everything.

847
00:53:29,228 --> 00:53:30,776
Speaker 1: it really lets you identify with you.

848
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:34,193
Speaker 1: tell me a lot more because now you kind of got used to the school you're.

849
00:53:34,395 --> 00:53:35,802
Speaker 1: you were grounded in this kind of.

850
00:53:36,124 --> 00:53:41,366
Speaker 1: here's the world of the show and now you're transported along with her to this other world.

851
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:50,554
Speaker 1: and I also point out that in this other world earth is in the sky like a moon and you see it and they know it and they know she's from there and they call it the cursed world.

852
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:50,614
Speaker 1: do?

853
00:53:51,238 --> 00:53:53,512
Speaker 1: they call it the curse world called the curse moon of the curse something.

854
00:53:53,532 --> 00:53:54,439
Speaker 0: I call it something.

855
00:53:54,499 --> 00:54:02,371
Speaker 0: I forget if it was cursed but they call it something and they're like it's like it's like it's like imagine if someone showed up like in front of your house and you knew that they were from the moon.

856
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:07,472
Speaker 0: you'd be like you're from the moon whoa but not just the moon the cursed moon.

857
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,279
Speaker 0: I don't remember if it was cursed.

858
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:10,886
Speaker 1: it is most definitely cursed.

859
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:12,151
Speaker 0: I forget I can't.

860
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:12,975
Speaker 0: I can't say either way.

861
00:54:13,437 --> 00:54:17,962
Speaker 1: I mean I don't want to talk about the plot anymore because this is kind of the like.

862
00:54:18,002 --> 00:54:26,552
Speaker 1: we're gonna talk about the show a couple more times in the far future because you know we got to do a final thoughts we got to do kind of the full review for people who have seen it all those sorts of things.

863
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:32,419
Speaker 1: but I don't feel like I need to talk more about the plot or anything because you need to see this show.

864
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,906
Speaker 1: this is one of the best anime ever.

865
00:54:34,228 --> 00:54:42,405
Speaker 1: if you if you're an anime fan and you haven't seen this show it's like saying I haven't seen cowboy bebop I haven't seen trygun I haven't seen Star Wars.

866
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:47,472
Speaker 0: okay so if you didn't have enough reasons already to go watch this Cofloni I got two more reasons for you.

867
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:54,355
Speaker 0: number one yoko kano music and also number two no but teriyuki character designs.

868
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,022
Speaker 0: that's the pointy nose guy.

869
00:54:56,042 --> 00:55:01,950
Speaker 1: I really like both of those people a lot and actually we're talking like a list anime you know.

870
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:04,341
Speaker 1: there's a third reason Maya Sakamoto.

871
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:06,050
Speaker 1: you realize this was like her premier role.

872
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:09,442
Speaker 1: ah I mean Maya Sakamoto who was famous.

873
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:12,191
Speaker 1: now this was her first real role she played.

874
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:20,738
Speaker 1: he told me the lead and she sang the opening song yaku soku wa erinai which is actually I really like that song.

875
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:29,335
Speaker 0: yeah you know the one thing is there is one song and it's not a bad song it's actually a really good song but it's like eska flow day.

876
00:55:29,956 --> 00:55:35,287
Speaker 0: as you know it's a lot like.

877
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:37,033

00:55:50,488 --> 00:55:51,352
Speaker 1: there are light motifs.

885
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:55,974
Speaker 0: I'd say it's yoko kano second best anime music scabula being her best enemy music.

886
00:55:56,014 --> 00:56:00,582

893
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:19,624
Speaker 1: I wouldn't rank them but it's easily cowboy bebop evangelical eska flown a try gun and something else.
