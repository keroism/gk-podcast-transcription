1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,828
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday October 23rd.

2
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:12,831
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:15,900
Speaker 1: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,700
Speaker 1: apples to apples.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:33,278
Speaker 1: So you know that new Zelda game that hourglass of phantoms whatnot?

7
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:33,758
Speaker 0: I do.

8
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,200
Speaker 0: I didn't even buy it or play it yet.

9
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought it.

10
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:40,118
Speaker 1: I've been playing it have not beat it yet, and there's a reason for that.

11
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,967
Speaker 1: actually There's this one dungeon in the game it.

12
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:46,560
Speaker 1: overall there are many things about this Zelda game that make me go.

13
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:50,899
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, this is the Zelda business, but there are other things about this game that make me go.

14
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:56,831
Speaker 1: This is just annoying and I wish I didn't have to do it And it's sort of tearing me two ways.

15
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:04,220
Speaker 1: and the one thing that's really bothering me Is this one dungeon sort of like the main big dungeon of the game and you have to keep returning to it.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,580
Speaker 1: It's like you go out to other dungeons around the world or map and you get stuff.

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,620
Speaker 1: You know new items one per dungeon of course.

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:11,688
Speaker 1: you know you.

19
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:16,583
Speaker 1: you get them and you come back and Every time you get something new you come back to the original dungeon And you kind of.

20
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:31,680
Speaker 1: now that you have this new item you can go further in the main dungeon, but This main dungeon is really fucking annoying and not so fun compared to the other dungeons because it's sort of one of those hide from Bad guys dungeons, but it's also a time limit dungeon.

21
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:38,265
Speaker 0: So yeah have to keep doing the parts of the dungeon or like there's no way to just well like open two areas and then Come back and beat them both.

22
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:44,008
Speaker 1: Well sometimes right they they allow you to Basically like the first few times.

23
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:44,531
Speaker 1: It's like you can.

24
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:47,445
Speaker 1: the first time in the beginning of the game We just do one floor.

25
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:51,833
Speaker 1: then the second time you go through you can do like two or three floors And you never had to do the first floor.

26
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:57,240
Speaker 1: more than once You know and the floors get easier to do because you have more items available to you.

27
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:59,061
Speaker 1: So you can just sort of blow through them quick You know.

28
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:02,882
Speaker 1: it's like as soon as you get the bombs like the second and third floors get a lot easier You know.

29
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:10,383
Speaker 1: and when you get the bomb shoes another floor gets a lot easier And you can also unlock the more treasure chests on certain floors And you get more items.

30
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:15,869
Speaker 0: what I was saying is could just go around the game like opening like doing all the things to open Everything and then just come back and beat the whole.

31
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:20,449
Speaker 1: no because you need to like come back Get another piece of the sea chart.

32
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,360
Speaker 1: go out to that new part of the sea chart to where the new dungeon is.

33
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,611
Speaker 1: Come back get another sea chart.

34
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,240
Speaker 1: go out to where that plays.

35
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:38,818
Speaker 0: You know like that you know I don't know because on one hand the formula like the original formula of Zelda kind of in my opinion almost peaked at Snes link to the past because that was just a straight-up.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:49,380
Speaker 0: There are areas you were denied to and as you get more items you were able to range ever Increasingly until eventually you were a master of the entire game, and there's a million dungeons, but I don't know.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Speaker 0: I guess that formula kind of got overplayed, and they they're trying to make it more interesting.

38
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:53,944
Speaker 1: I don't know.

39
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,740
Speaker 1: the games control surprisingly well with just the stylus.

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,747
Speaker 1: But there's one more thing to say about the crazy dungeon.

41
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:05,946
Speaker 1: is that you know after you go down like I say I guess five Floors or so or there's some floor I forget which floor it is you like.

42
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:11,809
Speaker 1: get to this yellow glowy bit right and you can use the yellow glowy bit to teleport Between there and the beginning of the dungeon.

43
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,424
Speaker 1: so now you don't have to do those in-between floors anymore You can just teleport past them.

44
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:21,363
Speaker 1: uh-huh, but I want to go and get all those treasure chests now that I've got new items On those in between.

45
00:03:21,383 --> 00:03:24,197
Speaker 0: well if you want treasure chests you got to go do something right.

46
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:24,679
Speaker 0: go get them.

47
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:24,940
Speaker 0: otherwise.

48
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,417
Speaker 1: But it's like but it's not like treasure chests in someplace.

49
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:30,196
Speaker 1: new is treasure Annoying place that I've done already.

50
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,840
Speaker 0: well Then wait and then get all those treasure chests at once later, but getting those treasure chests earlier gives me new powers.

51
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,149
Speaker 0: Well, you gotta choose between the two.

52
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:39,795
Speaker 1: right, but not only that right.

53
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:46,277
Speaker 1: let's say I go down But you have this timer and as you get more sand for your hourglass you get more time in the timer.

54
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:55,579
Speaker 1: and when you're in The dungeons not standing in a safe spot the main only this main dungeon other dungeons are normal when you're in this main dungeon not Standing in a safe spot the timer counts down.

55
00:03:56,062 --> 00:04:02,224
Speaker 1: So you try to stay in the safe spots as much as you can because that's also where the bad guys can't see you and You know you.

56
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:05,320
Speaker 1: you want to get there with as much time remaining as possible.

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,540
Speaker 1: Well when you get to the yellow spot, and you teleport back to the beginning of the dungeon it Remembers how much time it took you to get to that yellow spot.

58
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:26,323
Speaker 1: So if I teleport to the yellow spot for the beginning so I don't have to do those to repeat those floors And like cuts five minutes off my time, but now that I have new items I could actually make it there in like three minutes and save myself two minute You know.

59
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:30,044
Speaker 1: so it's like if I want to cut my time off I got to do it again.

60
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:40,354
Speaker 1: it at least the title of the game means something it does But it's it's tough because it's it's a lot better than a lot of recent Minish cats.

61
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:46,420
Speaker 1: yeah It's a zillion times well not as bad as Philip CDI, but that's not a Zelda game.

62
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,709
Speaker 0: That's one of those.

63
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:54,420
Speaker 1: I have no son Situations, but yeah, I guess we're not gonna fully review this until rim beats it, and I beat it and everything.

64
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:57,880
Speaker 1: But it's a really good Zelda game that I feel was worth the money.

65
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,920
Speaker 1: But I'm having a hard time beating it because this main part of the game is just so frustrating.

66
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,835
Speaker 0: I don't recall when Scott came into my room and said all right.

67
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:09,013
Speaker 0: Here's the puzzle From some part of the game kind of early on.

68
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:10,079
Speaker 0: how do you solve it?

69
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:15,080
Speaker 0: And I'm not gonna spoil it for you all, but the solution was kind of shitty.

70
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:29,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, like really shitty one of those Exactly and I feel like I would probably have solved it by accident after getting frustrated, but Something like that.

71
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:33,472
Speaker 1: so yeah if you like Zelda's you like this game.

72
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:36,520
Speaker 1: the stylus controls are sort of amazingly good.

73
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:43,597
Speaker 1: You kind of forget you're playing with the stylus after a while But at the same time playing on a shaky shaky train at some part most of the time doesn't matter.

74
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:48,475
Speaker 1: like walking around killing Bad guys is fine, but at other parts is like ah fuck fuck fuck.

75
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:49,720
Speaker 1: you got to play it somewhere.

76
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,549
Speaker 1: You're not shaking which is I think one thing they didn't think about.

77
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:53,231
Speaker 1: what the DS.

78
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,877
Speaker 1: Is that a game with like?

79
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 1: you cannot play Kirby's Whatever it is canvas curve canvas curse.

80
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,346
Speaker 1: I know it's been so long since I played it.

81
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,520
Speaker 1: you cannot play that in a car or a train or anything like that.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,731
Speaker 1: You need to be like sitting in a chair not moving or else You're just not gonna be able to play unless you like.

83
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:15,390
Speaker 1: I guess if you have like the shaky hand disease And it sort of counteracts the shakiness of your surround.

84
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,651
Speaker 1: Yes.

85
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,294
Speaker 1: Yes.

86
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:17,840
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's how it works.

87
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:19,651
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying.

88
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,578
Speaker 1: you get the at the point.

89
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,608
Speaker 1: It's yeah, right.

90
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:31,580
Speaker 0: so as you all may or may not be aware There are four times as many Americans living in urban cities than in rural areas.

91
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:38,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there there are four times more people living in New York City than farming.

92
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:41,959
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm total like just more people live in New York City than farm.

93
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,655
Speaker 1: So you took all the farmers and you stood them up next to all the New York City people.

94
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:58,040
Speaker 1: New Yorkers outnumber them for everyone got in a fight and If anyone who you would all be one-on-one fights and anyone who actually fought But would die there would be New Yorkers left and there wouldn't be farmers left.

95
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,758
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is New Yorkers would probably win anyway, just because they're generally tough.

96
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:04,060
Speaker 1: that yeah Yeah, some of the same time count them out.

97
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,228
Speaker 0: You know if we got this those many people think about it.

98
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:11,269
Speaker 0: at that point the farmers have one really really big advantage Threshers, that's what I'm saying.

99
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:12,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we got taxis.

100
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:21,540
Speaker 0: well Along those lines there are there are more people playing World of Warcraft right now as players in the game.

101
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,572
Speaker 0: Then there are farmers in the whole world at least in the US.

102
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:27,798
Speaker 1: you mean farmers actually farm not farmers.

103
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:29,223
Speaker 0: gold farming No, no.

104
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:32,933
Speaker 0: actual farmers digging up potatoes and I guess in the u.s.

105
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:33,956
Speaker 0: Is case corn.

106
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:36,144
Speaker 0: Yeah and corn derivatives Well, they're not digging them up.

107
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:40,386
Speaker 0: They're Harvest corn.

108
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I could dig up corn and harvest potatoes.

109
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,500
Speaker 1: All right, so are you just counting the World of Warcraft us players or the worldwide world?

110
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,133
Speaker 0: I don't know this article sucks, but I'm not even gonna get into that.

111
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:59,698
Speaker 0: but it brings up a much more interesting point that Scott and I were talking about a little bit before the show that the popular conception of America still seems to be that.

112
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,896
Speaker 0: you know People are generally rural in Midwestern like the heart of America the heartland of America.

113
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:05,317
Speaker 0: that was.

114
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,119
Speaker 0: that's what matters.

115
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:14,720
Speaker 0: but Americans are Mostly city-dwelling World of Warcraft players and not so much farmers.

116
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:29,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even you know, the other general conception of the core of America, which is the sort of you know, iconic Nuclear family with like, you know working dad and a soccer mom and kids in school playing sports and learning stuff.

117
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:39,900
Speaker 1: You know that sort of suburban ideal fantasy that doesn't really exist Even if you find the few of those that do exist the kids are playing World of Warcraft.

118
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,192
Speaker 1: The moms are playing casual games online.

119
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,200
Speaker 1: The dads are doing all sorts of text.

120
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:59,593
Speaker 0: I just think that up their AV system within a generation the real heartland of America in terms of just people Culturally is going to be the mp3 Downloading game playing video punk kid kind of thing.

121
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:01,800
Speaker 0: Yep, and I don't know I find that interesting.

122
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:14,855
Speaker 0: I just think the real issue under this is more that Society and culture kind of progressing faster than I guess ideas about society or government Relations with culture are able to keep up.

123
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:19,480
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean you go look at the news and you're never gonna see that.

124
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:28,966
Speaker 1: You know, it's like how when we make a big story on dig is like oh my god There was a nerd on the news like oh my god Mentioned video games.

125
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,840
Speaker 1: like there's a one reference to video games like on something, right?

126
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:35,539
Speaker 1: It's not supposed to be news.

127
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,178
Speaker 1: That should be so super commonplace because that's like a huge part of the culture.

128
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,099
Speaker 1: instead We still you know, the the the mainstream cult, you know, it I don't know.

129
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:57,740
Speaker 0: I guess the media have you know the media private vested interest in playing to their audience because the common mainstream media's audience is Not the World of Warcraft playing punk kid because that kid doesn't have time for TV and doesn't give a shit about it.

130
00:09:57,905 --> 00:10:03,901
Speaker 1: Yeah but at the same time even the World of Warcraft punk kids conception is that the World of Warcraft punk kid is sort of in a Minority.

131
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:13,372
Speaker 1: and I think that the media, you know not catching up with the culture is also Causing the false ideas about the culture at the same time.

132
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,740
Speaker 1: It's like it's sort of like its own little loop there.

133
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,219
Speaker 1: It's like because they don't realize the world is not the way they think it is.

134
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:22,120
Speaker 1: They give everyone the idea the world isn't the way they think it is.

135
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,735
Speaker 1: So they continue to portray the world in a way that it not is see.

136
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:33,420
Speaker 0: but then at the same time I wonder if a lot of those because especially kids in school and like urban areas just They might not even notice that because they don't watch their traditional media.

137
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:36,293
Speaker 0: Anyway, and they're all their friends play World of Warcraft.

138
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,880
Speaker 0: everyone they know plays World of Warcraft.

139
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:42,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'd like to see a survey where they ask them what they think about like.

140
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:52,300
Speaker 1: You know like the rest of the world's like, you know because I mean even if you're hanging out like with a whole group of nerds at Otakon there's 20,000 anime fans you think and the rest of the world doesn't even know what the fuck anime is.

141
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,749
Speaker 0: The thing is it's scary because it's kind of true.

142
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,814
Speaker 0: But not like it.

143
00:10:55,914 --> 00:11:05,273
Speaker 1: I don't know if we're at the turning point yet I think the no, it's like you sit there and you look at the the Circumstantial and anecdotal evidence you have right in front of your face.

144
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,060
Speaker 1: You're sitting around with 20,000.

145
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,720
Speaker 1: Here's here's a guy and you go out on the street and you send people say what the fuck is going on over there.

146
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:17,240
Speaker 0: Here's a good example you go to RIT the Rochester Institute of Technology, right?

147
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:28,314
Speaker 0: walk around the campus and you see mostly like frat boys sitting in hot tubs and People playing like football and hacky sack it might be and like normal stuff.

148
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:33,239
Speaker 0: or you see people going birds cold But you don't see it like geekery like just out there.

149
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:46,455
Speaker 0: But yet if you walk through the dorms outside of the public eye, it's nothing but kids Masturbating playing Counter-Strike sometimes both World of Warcraft World of Warcraft Playing D&D going to anime and all that.

150
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:51,296
Speaker 0: and I don't I feel like the next generation as that they grow up is going.

151
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:57,020
Speaker 0: we're gonna see a Kind of sudden and market shift in the conception of culture in the United States.

152
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,380
Speaker 1: Maybe that is part of it though and that the culture that we have reception the culture that we have is physically inside.

153
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:12,409
Speaker 1: it's a culture of individuality and Sort of privacy like everyone sits in their own room where no one can see Communicating with each other in a place.

154
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,742
Speaker 1: No one can see so since the culture is invisible It's not like.

155
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:21,284
Speaker 1: it's not like fashion where you walk around the street and you see all suddenly Everyone's wearing blue jeans.

156
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:26,405
Speaker 1: or it's not like you walk around the street and you see all these, you know, punk skater kids You know, it's like skater.

157
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,450
Speaker 1: culture is visible.

158
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,600
Speaker 1: You see it out there plus just locality.

159
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:38,740
Speaker 0: I mean if you take any culture and just average it out across the whole world Suddenly all the members of that culture no matter how big it is are pretty isolated from each other.

160
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:47,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but geeks and just I guess the current generation in the Western industrialized internet world They're connected to each other no matter where they are and we've said this a lot.

161
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,040
Speaker 0: But I have more in common with some geeky kid in China or some geeky kid in South Africa.

162
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:58,136
Speaker 0: Then I do with the majority of the people who live in the city where I physically am.

163
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Not only that, but I forgot what I was gonna say.

164
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:01,974
Speaker 1: Hold on.

165
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:03,080
Speaker 0: I don't know.

166
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:19,840
Speaker 0: I feel like our culture is gonna change a lot really quickly in our lifetimes And I think it's gonna be kind of an unprecedented pace of change because the new generations Have ways of communicating that the old generations just don't get and can't follow.

167
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:30,330
Speaker 1: Another thing I think what it is is that you know I there are like you see more geeks than you realize because geeks are sort of subtle, you know It's like unless they're wearing a geeky t-shirt, right?

168
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:32,380
Speaker 1: You see you might see geeks all the time.

169
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,208
Speaker 1: You see someone you might not realize that in their backpack is like ten pokemons, you know It's like you can't have ten pokemons.

170
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:40,272
Speaker 1: Like I walk around the street.

171
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:40,914
Speaker 1: What am I wearing?

172
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,400
Speaker 1: I'm wearing blue jeans.

173
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:53,029
Speaker 1: I'm wearing a blue t-shirt with a pic with a hot dog on it Right a picture of a hot dog on it, which I guess a super geek would recognize as a specific threadless shirt But most would just not even recognize it.

174
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:54,978
Speaker 1: and I was wearing like a Mets hoodie.

175
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:58,000
Speaker 1: So I don't even look like what I am, you know.

176
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,480
Speaker 1: So it's totally this invisible culture going on so people don't realize exactly how big it is.

177
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:05,000
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's by the same token.

178
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,220
Speaker 0: That's why there is a lot mean you wrote that thing about this the social currency of the geek world.

179
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,748
Speaker 0: a lot of people now will they kind of.

180
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:13,631
Speaker 0: it's not like.

181
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:21,140
Speaker 0: I mean you see the people who wear like the black t-shirt with The square print of the red dragon, but a lot of people now that are more with it.

182
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,682
Speaker 0: Just kind of.

183
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:27,749
Speaker 0: it's like they keep small tokens of who they really are visible Just kind of as a like.

184
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:34,100
Speaker 0: it's almost like a Masonic ring Sort of yeah, like you see a little tan berry hanging from someone's cell phone.

185
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:34,502
Speaker 1: It's like.

186
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:42,639
Speaker 1: it's like there's a few people I noticed on my commute Like there's a guy on the train who has a big old laptop and he's your typical, you know.

187
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:46,457
Speaker 1: Use a laptop business guy, but he's always playing some typical.

188
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:47,039
Speaker 0: use a laptop.

189
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:58,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, you know, I do I do but I still find that phrase funny yeah, but he's he's always playing a really crappy but He's always playing a different each time.

190
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:02,700
Speaker 1: I see him but crappy World War based FPS of some sort, you know.

191
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,960
Speaker 1: And there's like another guy is always playing like some crappy sports game on his PSP that no real gamer would buy.

192
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,285
Speaker 1: But that kind of person would buy.

193
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,733
Speaker 1: and there's another guy I see on the subway.

194
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,560
Speaker 1: Sometimes he's got this Helsing bag.

195
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:24,479
Speaker 1: He you know every other way he looks he's wearing, you know, the long-sleeve business shirt with a collar and you know pants for business But his bag says Helsing on it.

196
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:43,179
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I guess the real moral is not to turn this into a whole episode but I mean I want I also have to say that another Confounding factor here is simply that farming is a lot more efficient than it used to be and it takes far fewer people to farm Which that's why I guess the Iowa caucuses Infuriate me because they shouldn't be as important as they are, but I digress.

197
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:48,252
Speaker 1: I just World of Warcraft caucus, you know, what's the?

198
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:51,820
Speaker 1: what's the place in World of Warcraft called Azeroth Azeroth caucus?

199
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:54,652
Speaker 0: You know, I more every now and then people like that.

200
00:15:55,396 --> 00:16:04,788
Speaker 0: I would play World of Warcraft When I was in like high school, like I was a freshman sophomore in high school even in middle school I'm on the internet and I'm doing my internet shit.

201
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,920
Speaker 0: I always would think and I think a lot of geeks think the same thing.

202
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,685
Speaker 0: Wait a minute We're all over the place.

203
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,114
Speaker 0: What if we acted together?

204
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:14,599
Speaker 0: we could fuck things up.

205
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:19,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is we just haven't yet and there's a lot of reasons for that and we'll get into it.

206
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,699
Speaker 1: I really do think there should be some sort of internet caucus of sorts.

207
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,127
Speaker 1: I think what it's.

208
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:32,760
Speaker 1: even if I could do internet voting at least, you know Let the the people of that culture that are from the US that are you know living differently than everyone else.

209
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,998
Speaker 1: Let them have some sort of you know, say it's such a yeah, you know what?

210
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:44,139
Speaker 0: Here's the thing I like the idea and I feel like like if we Were inclined if we were even if it doesn't actually count if it's just yeah.

211
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,764
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

212
00:16:45,805 --> 00:17:01,537
Speaker 0: if we were well one if I was the lead like the head of the DNC or the head of the Republicans I Would push something like that just to make my party suddenly appear 10,000 times hipper than the other party and pretty much automatically get the vote of the internet generation.

213
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,084
Speaker 0: Ah, good call I like that.

214
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:08,380
Speaker 0: I think that because you wouldn't have to listen to it You don't give it any votes in the primaries or anything.

215
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,060
Speaker 0: But just do something like that and ignore whatever it says, but just say you're doing it and holy shit.

216
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,826
Speaker 0: But again, I digress.

217
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:22,579
Speaker 0: I think the point here if you sum it up, it's just that Gaming, I mean, you know, there's people like Jack Thompson.

218
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,547
Speaker 0: everyone worries like oh games are under attack.

219
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:25,511
Speaker 0: games are gonna be censored.

220
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:32,940
Speaker 0: gaming is becoming such a Silent ubiquitous part of American culture that I'm not worried.

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,239
Speaker 0: I think in a generation or two gaming is going to be as ubiquitous in the future as television is now.

222
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:43,019
Speaker 1: I mean Halo 3 made more monies than like most movies Yep and Nintendo.

223
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:53,452
Speaker 0: their market cap makes them one of the biggest companies in the world now almost entirely on the merits of selling the Wii to old Ladies and the DS mostly the DS to kids and old people.

224
00:17:53,472 --> 00:18:01,124
Speaker 1: All right, speaking of Nintendo Oh Nintendo Well, we were not doing any news or things of the day all last week, which is questions week Which you haven't listened to.

225
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,258
Speaker 1: you should go back listen all four episodes from last week.

226
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:07,820
Speaker 1: There was big news mostly from the Nintendo camp mostly a press release.

227
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:17,814
Speaker 1: So they announced everything in the frickin known universe and a couple other things too One of those things being they're delaying the Smash Brothers, which you know on the one hand Everyone is waiting for that.

228
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:27,360
Speaker 1: Smash Brothers Like it's gonna be the thing that changes the world and it will have a significant impact on the gaming population An impact I foresee people losing jobs.

229
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:37,324
Speaker 1: however, I really don't see a problem with the delay because the delay can only mean a. the game will be hopefully better right because Spend more time.

230
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,749
Speaker 0: Ah, I'm Duke Nukem forever.

231
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:39,973
Speaker 0: Yeah Team Fortress 2.

232
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:40,535
Speaker 1: Well, they did.

233
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:41,820
Speaker 1: they did announce a new date.

234
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,462
Speaker 1: It's not like.

235
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:44,147
Speaker 1: yeah, we're delaying it indefinitely.

236
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,771
Speaker 1: It's yeah, it's delayed until February.

237
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:48,700
Speaker 0: I believe I recall some Team Fortress 2 dates.

238
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:53,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, yeah, I think the delay will make the game better.

239
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:01,714
Speaker 1: Oh, I also there's so many games out like right now just cuz you know It's video game season and all these other games that they're talking about that.

240
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,260
Speaker 1: I'm kind of glad they pushed it back.

241
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,980
Speaker 1: So these other games actually, you know that I'm gonna buy no matter what get some time to get played.

242
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,640
Speaker 1: I mean if they put this out and Mario Galaxy out everyone will buy both and not play Mario Galaxy, you know It's well, I'll be honest.

243
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:18,874
Speaker 0: I would wager that most if not like most of the work is not like.

244
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:20,680
Speaker 0: they're not delaying it for any technical reason.

245
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:36,292
Speaker 0: I'm almost certain that they're delaying it just to put it into a better slot and like they probably looked at the Curve of what games are coming out when and they're like, all right winter game sales gonna slump Let's release it right then to have a continuous wave of sales

246
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:41,160
Speaker 1: exactly instead of people complaining about the Nintendo drought You know, oh they haven't come out with a game in like months.

247
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,940
Speaker 1: Well now they'll come out with a game and then a few months later they come out.

248
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,980
Speaker 1: You know, they come with a game instead of a bunch of games at once and then no games for a long time.

249
00:19:48,442 --> 00:20:00,080
Speaker 0: Well the Nintendo news that Scott was gonna bring up and I'll just jump right in here that I'm most looking forward to It's just the fact that Okami is being released on the Wii and I really really wanted to play that game and I thought it looked really awesome.

250
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:04,728
Speaker 0: I heard great things about it, but I Still just couldn't bring myself to buy a ps2.

251
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,620
Speaker 0: There just weren't enough compelling games for me as a gamer.

252
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:13,881
Speaker 1: There are a lot of compelling game there are but not a lot of them are brought to your attention because they're just so many and most of them are so Old.

253
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:22,375
Speaker 0: what I'm saying is there aren't enough compelling games for the ps2 to me to warrant me one buying it and to taking The time out of my life to play all those games.

254
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:24,300
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Take time to let to play all those games.

255
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,133
Speaker 1: I think if the ps2 gets like another price drop.

256
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:34,180
Speaker 1: and then you know If you were made aware of all the games for the ps2 like you actually sat down with a list of ps2 games It'd be incredibly long.

257
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:34,840
Speaker 0: Oh, there's all right.

258
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,812
Speaker 0: I can think of 10 or 15 that I want to play or have wanted.

259
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:42,106
Speaker 1: that's how many you can think of this probably like 40, you know, I think a better issues.

260
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:55,910
Speaker 0: if I were Nintendo I would approach Scott and I Scott had this idea to pretty much Everyone who made ps2 games and try to get the rights to just straight-up port those games to the Wii Yeah, and sell them for 20 bucks.

261
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean why not?

262
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,859
Speaker 1: Frickin The problem is you know Sony's got their big thing like oh, we're gonna make all these PlayStation games go on the ps3.

263
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,327
Speaker 1: I think they got stuff for like.

264
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:10,419
Speaker 1: you can play ps1 games on the PSP Like you can download them or something and stuff like that going on.

265
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:23,120
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you know if companies I think it's mostly for a lot of the companies that released, you know Really innovative sort of out there games that were different from the herd, you know Like the psychonauts and stuff things that didn't sell back then, you know.

266
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,400
Speaker 1: But you know, they they put them out and they're there and now they're not making money off them anymore.

267
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:35,160
Speaker 1: But it's like they're not like, you know It's like PC games where you can just take the same exact code and just put you know Draw attention to it again to try to make some more money.

268
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, like for example say you just took old scum.

269
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:46,400
Speaker 0: I'm putting all the ID software games on Steam take scum VM games Maybe update the graphics and then just release them in anthologies on the Wii for 40 bucks.

270
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,281
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean there's.

271
00:21:47,662 --> 00:22:06,160
Speaker 1: there's a big potential now for P. a lot of people have Wiis and DS's and a lot of people There aren't enough games for the Wiis and DS's to you know, and Nintendo's the only one who really makes like the big ones You know, so it's sort of difficult for people making new third-party games to compete with Nintendo.

272
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:22,060
Speaker 1: They just put a lot of crap out there and I think there's a big market for taking older games from other systems and just making Wii ports that are cheap or DS ports that are cheap and The game drought will go away because you fill it in with all these rereleases of awesome things.

273
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,660
Speaker 1: Of course a lot of people complain like oh the Wii is just full of rereleases.

274
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:31,349
Speaker 1: Well, most people didn't play a lot of those games, especially a lot of these, you know average grandmas and stuff buying Wiis.

275
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:39,233
Speaker 0: plus if there's a family that has a Wii and Grandma has to buy a game for their kid a lot of those games Really just will sell especially if they're 20 bucks.

276
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:45,780
Speaker 1: Yeah 50 bucks All right, but let's go down that it was big written in news's about all the releases that are gonna happen.

277
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:47,398
Speaker 1: So let's let's go over some of these.

278
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:49,367
Speaker 1: Today's the 23rd today.

279
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:54,113
Speaker 1: Actually the you remember the table tennis game from rockstar?

280
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:54,695
Speaker 0: I do.

281
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:55,780
Speaker 1: yeah, that's out on the we know.

282
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:59,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess if you're liking that, I don't know.

283
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:00,656
Speaker 1: I heard some good things.

284
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:03,807
Speaker 1: I heard some average things Price game.

285
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,400
Speaker 0: I don't think I could deal with the game like that.

286
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,702
Speaker 0: Just cuz.

287
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:08,800
Speaker 0: I played table tennis in the real world and I was really good at it.

288
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,125
Speaker 1: I think it'd be better than we.

289
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:13,759
Speaker 1: tennis probably but I don't know how if it's gonna be worth buying a whole game for it.

290
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:14,684
Speaker 0: Man, I'm just.

291
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:18,609
Speaker 0: I want Mario tennis to come out on the we so I know I know.

292
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:24,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, the Guitar Hero 3 comes out in like five days for everything.

293
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,243
Speaker 1: battalion wars - oh yeah, battalion wars supposed to be related to advance or somehow and Supposedly battalion wars.

294
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:38,654
Speaker 1: one was the suck, but I'm hearing some low rumblings about good stuff at the battalion wars - but I think it's worth paying for.

295
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:40,920
Speaker 0: It'll probably eventually be worth.

296
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,550
Speaker 1: It's the kind of game where I'd very much like to be able to like try it out maybe like rent it just well Don't worry Scott Johnson will buy it.

297
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,234
Speaker 1: Oh, that's for sure.

298
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:47,436
Speaker 1: Good.

299
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:53,500
Speaker 1: Good call There's gonna be a Namco museum for the the Wii which I don't understand because the DS one is fine.

300
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:54,859
Speaker 1: Why do I need the Wii one for?

301
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,530
Speaker 1: The Fire Emblem game comes out November 5th for Wii.

302
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,978
Speaker 1: the DDR for the Wii comes out November 6th.

303
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,974
Speaker 1: Lego Star Wars complete saga comes out November 6.

304
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:06,320
Speaker 0: Those games are actually pretty cool.

305
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean at first I was like Lego Star Wars whatever and then I saw like some footage from it.

306
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:13,533
Speaker 1: And I'm all about Lego Star Wars.

307
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:14,860
Speaker 1: This is the complete saga.

308
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,406
Speaker 1: So this is like all the Lego.

309
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:21,669
Speaker 1: Star Wars is like all of them supposedly and I'm torn Should I get it for the Wii or the DS?

310
00:24:21,689 --> 00:24:23,779
Speaker 1: I don't know which one do you think?

311
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:28,640
Speaker 0: You know just because we commute I think the DS is still gonna be our primary console.

312
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,515
Speaker 1: I know but this this feels like a game I should get for the Wii.

313
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:32,561
Speaker 1: maybe you know Cuz?

314
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,600
Speaker 1: it's sort of like the thing where everyone sits around watching and then laughing and stuff.

315
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:45,913
Speaker 1: Anyway that same November 6 apparently big release day the Mario Sonic Olympic Games is coming and while that looks okay I don't know if I want to buy that either.

316
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:59,560
Speaker 1: Yeah November 12th is the Mario Galaxy and that is why part of the reason why I'm glad they delayed the old Smash Brothers because now I can actually play Mario Galaxy without being rudely interrupted by a Smash Brothers release.

317
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,805
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to this.

318
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:06,514
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't even really play the the previous Mario game Feeling this is gonna be a lot better.

319
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:09,660
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, the thing is the best part of the last Mario game.

320
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:18,574
Speaker 0: Were all those like in the pipe stages where you run across just three-dimensional things and Jumping platform and all the puzzle II go around the world.

321
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:20,000
Speaker 0: I didn't care about that at all.

322
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,914
Speaker 0: I just wanted to do 3d Mario levels.

323
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:22,700
Speaker 0: that were really hard.

324
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,236
Speaker 1: Yep, we got some geometry wars coming on the 13th.

325
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,623
Speaker 1: for the Wii There's an.

326
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:30,380
Speaker 1: I think this geometry war is coming for the DS also.

327
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,567
Speaker 1: I don't know what the date on that is.

328
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,780
Speaker 1: We got the puzzle quest coming for the Wii.

329
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:35,729
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna start with the dates anymore.

330
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,960
Speaker 0: Well, you know this made me realize that you could Redo and release something like DEFCON on the Wii pretty handily.

331
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,980
Speaker 0: Yep, right kind and it probably do really well.

332
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,940
Speaker 1: There's another trauma center coming for the Wii that allows like tag team surgery where you both surgery at the same time.

333
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,798
Speaker 0: That sounds awesomely stupid or stupidly awesome sad.

334
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:54,280
Speaker 1: I agree.

335
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:58,844
Speaker 1: Hey, there's some golden compass thing people are talking about But I don't know about that.

336
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:04,527
Speaker 1: the that Rygar which people have been talking about about that up the Knights game I'm getting Knights for people who don't understand.

337
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:09,429
Speaker 1: you might have noticed on certain video game blogs all this hubbub about like Knights into dreams.

338
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:10,476
Speaker 1: whatever I haven't.

339
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:19,560
Speaker 1: yeah Well, there's a game was a game for the Sega Saturn called Knights into dreams And it was like this huge game for the Sega Saturn went like it was on the cover of every video game magazine.

340
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:22,920
Speaker 1: I played demos in stores, and I think I played it at someone's house once.

341
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:30,866
Speaker 1: It was an awesome freaking game where you're like this jester thing flying around and it was sort of like a flying platforming kind of game.

342
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:37,080
Speaker 1: it was there really isn't much else like it and Everyone, you know, it's one of those things where people say hey whatever happened to that?

343
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,843
Speaker 1: You know cuz it's.

344
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,460
Speaker 1: it's like a game they made once and people liked it and then it's like where did it go?

345
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:50,200
Speaker 1: we don't know what happened to that and They're finally making another ones coming out for the Wii and I'm probably just gonna buy it Because I got to support that kind of action.

346
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:54,280
Speaker 1: Some Soul Calibur legends, I don't know what's up with that.

347
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:05,260
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is Soul Calibur kind of disappointed me because I know a lot of people agree with me though There are exceptions that Soul Calibur 2 was a lot better than like Soul Calibur 3 wasn't really worse than Soul Calibur 2.

348
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,050
Speaker 0: It just it wasn't better enough for anyone to care.

349
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:15,293
Speaker 0: Yep, and I to this day Soul Calibur 2 is Probably one of my favorite, you know traditional fighting games out there.

350
00:27:15,313 --> 00:27:17,300
Speaker 1: Soul Calibur 2 is one of the best fighting game.

351
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,520
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that and it could be Shido blade.

352
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,226
Speaker 1: No, but Shido blade is awesome.

353
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,200
Speaker 1: Soul Calibur 2 I think I will say is the best 3d fighting game.

354
00:27:26,381 --> 00:27:28,248
Speaker 0: There is just a hot damn still.

355
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:35,060
Speaker 1: I want a new Soul Calibur to come out But it's got to be better than Soul Calibur 2 which is hard because the bar is really high.

356
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean three just wasn't better enough.

357
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:42,284
Speaker 0: Like it had incremental improvements and incremental I guess On improvements.

358
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:44,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, like no link.

359
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:44,711
Speaker 1: No GameCube.

360
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:45,433
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:45,614
Speaker 0: Yeah.

362
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:46,918
Speaker 0: No GameCube is pretty much it.

363
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:50,705
Speaker 1: Yeah Smash Brothers in the spring.

364
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:55,360
Speaker 1: There's there's crystal chronicles coming for both systems, but they've been talking about those for so long.

365
00:27:55,844 --> 00:27:59,807
Speaker 1: But I just keep changing the name Putting out new screenshots.

366
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,492
Speaker 1: Well, there's no conclusive anything.

367
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:01,994
Speaker 0: I don't care.

368
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:16,912
Speaker 0: Those games are coming out someday and I gotta say The the thing the defining moment in gaming for me is going to be when I turn on my DS Connect it wirelessly to my Wii and play some sort of four-player multiplayer Semi-cooperative game.

369
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:17,880
Speaker 1: I don't think that's how it's gonna work.

370
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,300
Speaker 1: I think there's a Wii game and a DS game and I'd haven't heard about.

371
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:21,626
Speaker 1: Everyone's always talking.

372
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:23,034
Speaker 1: are they gonna link up link and link it.

373
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,200
Speaker 0: I know I didn't say this will be it.

374
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:36,120
Speaker 0: I just said once there is a game that uses the DS and the Wii in a competitive Cooperative way, I think that is going to be the greatest game of our generation.

375
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,680
Speaker 1: It's all we got now is the pokemons because so I mean soul caliber crystal chronicles for the GameCube was flawed.

376
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:56,813
Speaker 0: it was mostly just a tech demo, but at the same time it proved to me that Even a flawed game like that can be fucking awesome and four swords had a similar feeling Like Nintendo was so close to greatness.

377
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,139
Speaker 0: They just don't bother.

378
00:28:58,782 --> 00:28:59,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't have to.

379
00:29:00,047 --> 00:29:02,155
Speaker 0: I know where they aim so much lower than they could.

380
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:03,400
Speaker 0: they had to learn from moonlight miles.

381
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,612
Speaker 0: They go into space and have sex with Sherpa.

382
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,060
Speaker 1: They're exactly the same as Apple.

383
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,300
Speaker 1: It's like you have this this potential, right?

384
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,760
Speaker 1: You have this but you're on like the top of a mountain with all this potential energy And you could roll all the way down the mountain and achieve terminal velocity.

385
00:29:16,402 --> 00:29:20,660
Speaker 1: But instead if you only roll halfway down the mountain, you'll still get a bajillion dollars.

386
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:23,675
Speaker 1: So why wait why roll all the way halfway all the way down the mountain?

387
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,700
Speaker 1: You can just roll halfway down.

388
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,369
Speaker 1: It's so much more work to roll all the way down.

389
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,860
Speaker 1: why bother so they don't and they still make up a jillion dollars.

390
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:30,383
Speaker 1: They don't care.

391
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:31,330
Speaker 0: That's why to this day.

392
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:35,554
Speaker 0: Maybe we should in the future We should do a donation campaign to buy a we dev kit.

393
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:39,427
Speaker 1: Yeah Let's see, let's wrap this up.

394
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:46,620
Speaker 1: we've been going for like 30 minutes, okay DS People are talking about that front mission who like those tactical robot kind of stuff.

395
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,235
Speaker 0: Dave and Joel were talking about front mission at some point.

396
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:50,120
Speaker 1: Yeah front mission DS.

397
00:29:50,341 --> 00:29:53,653
Speaker 1: Actually, I played his worms new worms for the DS.

398
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:54,456
Speaker 1: that's already out.

399
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:55,420
Speaker 0: you guys said it was good.

400
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,499
Speaker 1: I played it and it was not bad like the first worms for the DS.

401
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:06,379
Speaker 1: So go buy worms - for the DS if you like worms But make sure you get the worms - for the DS and not the original worms the DS which God the original worms.

402
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,118
Speaker 0: luckily I didn't buy it, but I like I'd planned out I was like worms for the DS.

403
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:13,990
Speaker 0: Oh, man, and luckily someone else took that bullet.

404
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:15,856
Speaker 1: No Mario Party DS is.

405
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:17,420
Speaker 1: is it out or is it coming out?

406
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:19,547
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know if I care.

407
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,032
Speaker 1: it's it's it's supposed.

408
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:29,683
Speaker 1: at least people say it's a little faster even though I still think it's Mario Party and Mostly it only has local wireless not the Wi-Fi action Which I guess.

409
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:31,715
Speaker 1: that's why good a lot of people are acting like.

410
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:32,540
Speaker 1: that's a bad thing.

411
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,980
Speaker 0: But I'm like, do you want to play a Mario Party with someone who isn't in the room with it?

412
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:39,319
Speaker 1: The only way they're gonna quit the game and you'll be stuck.

413
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:50,715
Speaker 0: Not only that the only point of playing Mario Party I mean the game is so slow that like playing it without three other people in the room and Some sort of championship belt is just not worth.

414
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:54,079
Speaker 1: to be honest with you The DS has Wi-Fi and I have a lot of Wi-Fi games.

415
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:58,785
Speaker 1: I just never used the Wi-Fi cuz it's kind of and I'm not interested in Wireless.

416
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,130
Speaker 1: I use crazily like.

417
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,793
Speaker 0: I think some games could do it better like You could probably do something with advance Wars.

418
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:11,472
Speaker 0: that will go really well on the Wi-Fi But most of the time I'd rather play with actual human beings.

419
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,840
Speaker 0: and I say that because people on the internet are not humans.

420
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:17,200
Speaker 1: Speaking of advance Wars new new advance Wars.

421
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:21,976
Speaker 1: But they change in all the look don't care and they're changing all the CEOs.

422
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:22,599
Speaker 1: I don't care.

423
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:25,030
Speaker 0: She's still she's still the game.

424
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,240
Speaker 1: I want it's it's advance or so?

425
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:35,380
Speaker 0: I'm a man who beat advance Wars one Every mission in normal and hard with an s-rank and then everything in the war rooms.

426
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:41,940
Speaker 0: I did the same thing for advance Wars 2 and The only reason I didn't do it for advance Wars DS is because it was all the same man.

427
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,960
Speaker 1: It's looking like the game is just more advance Wars.

428
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:57,885
Speaker 0: Well plus that from what I've read they kind of dumped all the CEOs and it's like they're starting fresh with a lot of things Which is really a good idea because the CEO balance in advance Wars as it was Was getting kind of broken.

429
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:02,260
Speaker 0: like I just the there were only like two CEOs.

430
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,654
Speaker 0: They were actually good and everything else was just crap.

431
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:05,217
Speaker 1: Mmm.

432
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,516
Speaker 0: It's true Plus the fact that I just kind of broken the game by playing it too much.

433
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,340
Speaker 0: I need something more.

434
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:18,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah in general it's like hey, you know There's there's a lot anyone who's still complaining like all the weeds got no games.

435
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:19,480
Speaker 1: all the DS got no games.

436
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:27,200
Speaker 0: The only legitimate complaint you can have is that the Wii does not have the full potential realized yet.

437
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:31,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in a in a month from now There's gonna be plenty of Wii games.

438
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,180
Speaker 1: You'll have nothing to complain about anyone who says oh there's no games for the Wii.

439
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,770
Speaker 1: That I think the people who are is gonna be saying.

440
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:45,780
Speaker 1: if you're still saying that a month or two from now Then all that means is you just don't like the video games that there are because there are plenty to like.

441
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:48,090
Speaker 1: You just only care about Smash Brothers.

442
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,597
Speaker 1: not you know, I mean right now.

443
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,592
Speaker 1: I must agree There's not a lot of Wii games.

444
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:57,660
Speaker 1: a month from now There will be plenty of Wii games and if you just don't like those games, that's you.

445
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,461
Speaker 1: That's no longer Nintendo's fault.

446
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:08,609
Speaker 1: a month from now things of the day.

447
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:09,250
Speaker 1: Let's make it quick.

448
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:12,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, we probably should but I found this.

449
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:18,324
Speaker 0: I had another thing But I'm saving it and it's someone's list of the people who are ruining halo 3 now.

450
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:21,817
Speaker 0: when I started reading it I thought it was a joke.

451
00:33:21,937 --> 00:33:28,010
Speaker 0: I thought it was one of those ironic like tongue-in-cheek Kind of like back in the day like in the quake two days.

452
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,890
Speaker 0: I read an article that was similar, but it was like what is ruining quake 2 lithium death match death match.

453
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,137
Speaker 0: It was like number one BFG whores.

454
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:37,923
Speaker 0: number two rocket launcher.

455
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:40,130
Speaker 1: There were eight people three everybody.

456
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:42,318
Speaker 0: Gaga you can't horten weapon huh?

457
00:33:42,418 --> 00:33:51,215
Speaker 0: the last the last entry was blaster whores And then there was an addendum jumping whores and it was like if you don't get the joke by now You shouldn't be playing this game.

458
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:51,677
Speaker 0: Yep.

459
00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:56,795
Speaker 0: Well this article is the same article for Halo 3, but This guy's not kidding.

460
00:33:57,396 --> 00:34:00,063
Speaker 0: He's actually complaining about all right.

461
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:03,833
Speaker 0: number one thing ruining the Halo 3 swordsmen.

462
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:06,166
Speaker 0: people who can't the sword and use the horn.

463
00:34:06,226 --> 00:34:07,853
Speaker 0: number two Rocket whores.

464
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:09,659
Speaker 0: people who can't the rocket and use it.

465
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,585
Speaker 0: number three people who use the laser.

466
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:13,330
Speaker 0: number four children playing the game.

467
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,096
Speaker 0: Number five people who can't.

468
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:16,681
Speaker 0: number six people who snipe.

469
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,710
Speaker 0: number seven people who go for achievements.

470
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:21,079
Speaker 0: Number eight people who quit games in the middle.

471
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:27,425
Speaker 0: the only legitimate complaint here is people who go Into the microphone, but you know what that?

472
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:28,130
Speaker 0: that's a problem.

473
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:30,702
Speaker 1: I have a separate rant about the achievements.

474
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:40,054
Speaker 1: right but for every other complaint All I have to say is those were problems with FPS is way back in the day that have largely been solved well Except in Halo.

475
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:43,070
Speaker 1: not to say that more modern FPS is than Halo.

476
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:46,350
Speaker 1: You know not speaking time wise because Halo 3 very modern.

477
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:49,860
Speaker 1: It's pretty much brand new but modern PC FPS is.

478
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,750
Speaker 1: don't have these problems of camping weapons anymore and TF 2.

479
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,270
Speaker 1: It's a class being a natural selection.

480
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:58,849
Speaker 1: It's a game where just people you know you buy the weapons and counter-strike you buy weapons with money.

481
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,570
Speaker 1: These things don't happen in FPS.

482
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:04,577
Speaker 0: Solve these problems like lithium deathmatch.

483
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:08,710
Speaker 0: no no once you had a weapon if you were good you could beat anyone.

484
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,472
Speaker 0: It wasn't like.

485
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:15,918
Speaker 0: I remember once I was playing and I was accused of being a hyper blaster whore because I was using nothing But the hyper blaster.

486
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:23,390
Speaker 0: so I went got the chaingun And then I got accused of being a chaingun whore, and then I started using the fucking shotgun, and then I got kicked.

487
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but like counter-strike.

488
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:28,390
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what fucking weapon you choose encounter.

489
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:32,070
Speaker 1: You have to use the different weapons in different ways.

490
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,202
Speaker 1: But it's not like people use the AK a ruin in the game.

491
00:35:35,403 --> 00:35:37,350
Speaker 1: people use the AWP ruin in the game.

492
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:37,571
Speaker 1: It's.

493
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:39,383
Speaker 1: it's like the guns part of the game.

494
00:35:39,423 --> 00:35:40,409
Speaker 1: It's part of the game.

495
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:46,950
Speaker 1: It's not like if a gun in the game and people using it to the best of its ability is ruining the game.

496
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:54,827
Speaker 0: So I say game is a bad game and so I saw you JW maker of this list on this website that I don't really care much about.

497
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,657
Speaker 0: Welcome to FPS is.

498
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,690
Speaker 0: I hope you have a good time, but I think you have a lot to learn.

499
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,542
Speaker 1: All right, I got it like 1990 called.

500
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,625
Speaker 0: They want their list back.

501
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, okay?

502
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:08,592
Speaker 1: Check this out.

503
00:36:08,612 --> 00:36:13,910
Speaker 1: this guy all right went to a DMV, and he stole the thing that prints driver's licenses.

504
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:15,113
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

505
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:20,407
Speaker 1: Oh, man, and he was printed out IDs and doing all sorts of identity thefts.

506
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:25,030
Speaker 0: I guess technically oh I would have made really I would have made funny driver's licenses.

507
00:36:25,211 --> 00:36:27,019
Speaker 1: I'm sure he might have done some of those two right.

508
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,190
Speaker 0: I would just want to put a subtle joke in my driver's license.

509
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,959
Speaker 1: Now get this already.

510
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,688
Speaker 1: here's where the hilarity comes.

511
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:34,722
Speaker 1: all right This is a non gaming thing of the day.

512
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:35,650
Speaker 1: Just because it was so great.

513
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:41,224
Speaker 1: It's a. it's some sort of digi mark printer or something and they only sell these obviously to.

514
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:43,490
Speaker 1: you know the DMV that you know.

515
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,699
Speaker 1: There's nowhere else to get.

516
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,170
Speaker 0: he called to get tech support.

517
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:47,517
Speaker 1: He called it did.

518
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,750
Speaker 1: he couldn't get the to work with his computer.

519
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:58,129
Speaker 1: He needed the drivers for it, so he called the tech support for the printer, and then the Secret Service game Win.

520
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:03,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you steal something that that's all tech support.

521
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:04,495
Speaker 0: I think that goes.

522
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,726
Speaker 0: I think that pushes past black shade into epic fail.

523
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:21,850
Speaker 0: Yeah Right so we've talked every now and then about a lot of really hardcore games like Tigers and Euphrates And Puerto Rico and we're gonna talk about a different kind of game today.

524
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,030
Speaker 0: But we're not gonna talk about these games in general.

525
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,718
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about a very specific one.

526
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:31,383
Speaker 0: the game is apples to apples And it is a card game that is public.

527
00:37:31,403 --> 00:37:32,468
Speaker 0: I don't care who publishes.

528
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:34,254
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter I'll look it up while you're talking.

529
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:35,398
Speaker 0: It's a game.

530
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:38,550
Speaker 0: That is so simple and yet so fun.

531
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:48,470
Speaker 0: I don't care if you've never played a border card game in your life Or if you were the kind of person who has beaten and solved pretty much every board game you've ever played.

532
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:51,167
Speaker 1: yeah, even someone like Who's the?

533
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,099
Speaker 1: Chess guy who's like a sprawl?

534
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,665
Speaker 1: No no the good the bad one.

535
00:37:55,946 --> 00:37:56,770
Speaker 0: Oh Bobby Fisher.

536
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,400
Speaker 1: Yes, even Bobby Fisher would have fun one.

537
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,790
Speaker 1: even Bobby Fisher would have fun playing apple.

538
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,309
Speaker 0: You know what if you don't have fun playing apples to apples either one you're.

539
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,480
Speaker 1: Even Hitler would have fun.

540
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:08,385
Speaker 0: There are two of course.

541
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:13,164
Speaker 1: Hitler would have fun Seriously like even the worst person in the world.

542
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:14,350
Speaker 0: well know what I'm gonna say have fun.

543
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,176
Speaker 1: There are two possibilities.

544
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,222
Speaker 0: if you are not having fun playing apples apples.

545
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,810
Speaker 0: one you are a shitty person, too.

546
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:21,722
Speaker 1: You're doing it wrong.

547
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:25,902
Speaker 0: No two Everyone in the room playing the game is shitty except you.

548
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:28,030
Speaker 1: uh three you're doing it wrong.

549
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even it's hard to do.

550
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,670
Speaker 1: yeah, okay, so here's the way apples apples works.

551
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:37,970
Speaker 1: You buy this big box and there's these expansions with different cards.

552
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:39,075
Speaker 1: You want them all.

553
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:41,144
Speaker 1: you want as many cards as you can get pretty much.

554
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:44,193
Speaker 1: There's even a Jewish set and It is hilarious.

555
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:46,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's green cards, and there's red cards.

556
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:48,930
Speaker 1: most of them are red cards, but this green cards?

557
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:49,392
Speaker 1: Yeah,

558
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,178
Speaker 0: everyone on the hand of red car everyone

559
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:52,643
Speaker 1: has like seven red car, and

560
00:38:52,683 --> 00:39:06,202
Speaker 0: they're all nouns like alabaster or Mahatma Gandhi or global thermonuclear holocaust or fish Fishy-fishy or your mom grandma's house something

561
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:10,162
Speaker 1: like that right and they're all just nouns or Person places things stuff like that.

562
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,310
Speaker 0: you games Hillary Clinton.

563
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:15,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, the idea and every card also has a funny little like subtext on it.

564
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:24,990
Speaker 1: So it'll be like you know like Richard Nixon, and then in the subtext that'll be like I'm not a crook you know something like that, and then the green cards are all descriptive.

565
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:38,743
Speaker 1: They might not be adjectives per se most of them are but they're usually descriptive in some way like scary Diabolical frightening smelly awesome and instead of a subtext they have synonyms.

566
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:50,790
Speaker 1: so generally what you do is you draw a green card and The greet you'll say like you know odiferous Something something something smelly and the word is smelly see any bright.

567
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,418
Speaker 1: So the way the game goes is everyone.

568
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,344
Speaker 1: does you got as many people as you can?

569
00:39:55,384 --> 00:39:58,915
Speaker 1: I think the game technically only supports like You have.

570
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:06,959
Speaker 0: we'll talk about this at the end, but if you have more than like five or six people the game Breaks down unless you play it a little bit differently, but anyway.

571
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think technically it's for four to ten players.

572
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:11,434
Speaker 1: ten players I think is the Mattie.

573
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,422
Speaker 1: you can play with a lot of people.

574
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:15,550
Speaker 1: you can get like 15 people to play if you have enough.

575
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, just you have to do a few changes to make it work.

576
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,679
Speaker 1: I think though there that for ten is the best number.

577
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:23,268
Speaker 1: you know four to ten is good like seven eight people.

578
00:40:23,328 --> 00:40:23,850
Speaker 1: good anyway.

579
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:27,519
Speaker 1: So everyone has a handful of red cards the nouns.

580
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,246
Speaker 1: one person whose turn it is picks doesn't?

581
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:30,607
Speaker 1: they're not?

582
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,052
Speaker 1: they put their red cards Face down.

583
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:32,796
Speaker 1: They're not looking at them.

584
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:34,162
Speaker 1: They take one green card.

585
00:40:34,524 --> 00:40:35,730
Speaker 1: They read the green card.

586
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:43,785
Speaker 1: They put it face up, so let's let's play room you ready all right my agree I'm the green card, and you're all the people with the red cards, which is everyone else playing.

587
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:51,096
Speaker 1: all right the green card says I Don't know Poisonous poisonous all right.

588
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:54,044
Speaker 0: so now I'll talk as the like collective people.

589
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:59,630
Speaker 0: we all sit there look at my hand and all right Which of my red cards best exemplifies poisonous?

590
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,154
Speaker 0: And maybe I have.

591
00:41:01,174 --> 00:41:02,037
Speaker 0: I don't know.

592
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,889
Speaker 0: the apple from Snow White is just one of my things like all right that fits.

593
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:06,672
Speaker 0: that was Poisonous.

594
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:14,210
Speaker 0: I put it down and someone else is looking through and they have arsenic and they're like yeah, that's poison They put it down, and then you go to the third person.

595
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,626
Speaker 0: They're looking and they they see Hillary Clinton, and they're like huh, and they put that down.

596
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:21,110
Speaker 1: someone else has snake.

597
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:23,161
Speaker 1: They put that oh snake.

598
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:26,919
Speaker 0: and the fifth person has Catamite and they're like I don't have whatever.

599
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:27,964
Speaker 0: I'm just throwing that down.

600
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:32,930
Speaker 0: and the last person has Puppies and they think I mean they have a bunch of cards.

601
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:38,410
Speaker 0: They think you know what I'm going for the ironic humor, and they put down puppy or the antonym humor.

602
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:39,153
Speaker 1: Yes, right.

603
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:49,250
Speaker 1: so now everyone who besides the person who put down the green card has put down one red Card from their hand right and then they each draw one replacement red card from the decks.

604
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,150
Speaker 1: And you have a lot of fucking cards like thousands of hundreds of cards right now.

605
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,950
Speaker 0: Here is where the game like this is the crux of the game.

606
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,893
Speaker 0: This is what makes it great.

607
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:56,736
Speaker 0: the game is not.

608
00:41:56,816 --> 00:42:00,810
Speaker 0: there's no rule like the card that best fit wins or whatever.

609
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:15,742
Speaker 0: Whoever put up the green card draws all these red cards looks through them one by one Says what they are and puts them down, and then they decide which red card fits by whatever criteria They desire.

610
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:23,570
Speaker 1: oh yeah They don't know whose red card belongs to who because they did them all face down and whose red card belongs to whom right?

611
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,832
Speaker 1: So like right.

612
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:28,483
Speaker 1: so I can't help rim win by always picking the card.

613
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:29,145
Speaker 1: you know that.

614
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,590
Speaker 1: I know that rim put down.

615
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:38,189
Speaker 0: You know bill clinton song or play Bastard game theory and always pick the card of the whoever's losing just to make sure I win.

616
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:41,209
Speaker 1: yep You can't do that because you don't know which card belongs to which person.

617
00:42:41,229 --> 00:42:53,930
Speaker 1: so You look through all these red cards, and I look at the word poisonous And I pick which one I think is Poisonous, and you know just playing the car first you show all the cards to everyone that everyone played and you laugh a lot.

618
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,920
Speaker 0: It's usually like poisonous.

619
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,787
Speaker 0: Let's see all right puppies.

620
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:04,003
Speaker 0: Huh, well there was that one puppy blah blah blah arsenic.

621
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:11,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep, you got it Clinton.

622
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,781
Speaker 1: yeah, you know it's a lot of these sometimes.

623
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:14,906
Speaker 1: They're clever sometimes.

624
00:43:14,986 --> 00:43:15,930
Speaker 1: It is so unrelated.

625
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,996
Speaker 1: They're not anything.

626
00:43:17,117 --> 00:43:18,143
Speaker 0: you see what they did there.

627
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:19,954
Speaker 0: the game is not You know.

628
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,570
Speaker 0: pick the card that fits best or whatever the game is.

629
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:30,110
Speaker 0: Look at the person who drew this green card and think what could I play to get them to choose it?

630
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you know that I'm playing the green card this turn.

631
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:36,999
Speaker 1: You know if you play the the puppy.

632
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,490
Speaker 1: if I put the cute card, and you put you know say trilobite.

633
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:42,608
Speaker 1: You know that's probably gonna win because you know it's me.

634
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:46,550
Speaker 1: But you put that when rims playing the green card you try to put cute trilobite.

635
00:43:47,273 --> 00:43:50,388
Speaker 1: You might not win against like cute kitty or something you know.

636
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:51,732
Speaker 0: so it's The.

637
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:54,123
Speaker 0: this is what's the coolest thing about this game is over time.

638
00:43:54,143 --> 00:43:54,725
Speaker 0: you know with you.

639
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:56,935
Speaker 0: if they pick your card You get the green card.

640
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:59,044
Speaker 0: you put it in front of you, and then the game ends.

641
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:05,885
Speaker 1: when I mean there about it Doesn't matter like you get four depending on the number of players You need like a certain number of green cards in front doesn't matter.

642
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:06,710
Speaker 0: you just play for a while.

643
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:19,030
Speaker 0: Then you see who amass the most cards, and it's interesting because whoever amass the most cards is Effectively the person who is most in tune with the zeitgeist of your group of friends or got all the good cards.

644
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,935
Speaker 0: Well see there are ways to mitigate that too.

645
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:34,204
Speaker 0: It's really just the person who is able on average and in aggregate to Best read all of their friends and play cards from their limited pool that would cause those cards to be chosen.

646
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:48,230
Speaker 1: yep and Let me tell you hilarity was guaranteed to ensue like it's hard to really Understand like just knowing the rules of the game Why it would be so awesome, but as soon as you play it I mean you might not figure it out right away.

647
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:50,463
Speaker 1: But I mean anyone like.

648
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:51,610
Speaker 1: I played this with my family.

649
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,435
Speaker 1: You know I bet I was.

650
00:44:52,515 --> 00:44:59,229
Speaker 1: I went to my family's house in the Rosh Hashanah right and on the way I just bought apples to apples and brought it there right cuz someone had mentioned it and I'm like I'm gonna do it.

651
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:01,260
Speaker 1: So I got everyone to play it.

652
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,027
Speaker 1: the whole family like usually you know We want to play a game and like only me and my cousins will play.

653
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:13,388
Speaker 1: you know Everyone was playing like every single person all the aunts and uncles and grandma and my parents and everybody right the whole family.

654
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:16,482
Speaker 1: and you Know we were just kind of playing having a little fun right.

655
00:45:16,522 --> 00:45:23,290
Speaker 1: and then you know we You know grandma with he was my aunt puts down a green card and the green card was scary.

656
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:30,190
Speaker 1: Alright, and everyone's trying to figure out which red card in their hand is scary, and I know someone plays Hitler someone plays Gandhi.

657
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:37,294
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, yeah, I guess someone plays Hitler someone plays poison plays like my plays lightning rush limbaugh Yeah, whatever.

658
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:38,518
Speaker 1: You know my dad.

659
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:39,141
Speaker 1: He smiles.

660
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:39,462
Speaker 1: He's like.

661
00:45:39,522 --> 00:45:41,469
Speaker 1: I got this one, and he puts it down right.

662
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,054
Speaker 1: and Okay, you know.

663
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:53,930
Speaker 1: and everyone's sitting around and now my aunt's going through the card the red cards one at a time And then she comes out and she's lights like it says grandma's house and my dad played this guy.

664
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:56,399
Speaker 1: No one knew he played it until you know.

665
00:45:56,439 --> 00:46:00,555
Speaker 1: my aunt said you know grandma's house is the winner and my dad was like That's me tadpoles.

666
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:02,683
Speaker 1: tadpoles is the winner exactly you know.

667
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:10,729
Speaker 1: but like even grandma was left You know that that was the moment my family sort of figured out the game like oh, yeah, this game is the business.

668
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:15,250
Speaker 0: There's no reason for you to not buy this game and all the expansion.

669
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:18,703
Speaker 1: Everyone should at least have the basic set and whatever.

670
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:18,944
Speaker 1: you have.

671
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:26,370
Speaker 0: a whole bunch of people over Bust it out because I mean we're hardcore, and we want to play Tigers and Euphrates and la cheetah.

672
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,033
Speaker 0: But you know what?

673
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:34,986
Speaker 0: pretty much any time someone suggests play apples apples And we actually have apples to apples handy, and we have enough people.

674
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:35,850
Speaker 1: We'll just have it.

675
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:37,457
Speaker 1: We have a good opportunity to do it.

676
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:38,522
Speaker 0: We'll just play it.

677
00:46:38,622 --> 00:46:40,390
Speaker 0: It's such a great social game.

678
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:41,270
Speaker 0: It's just it's here.

679
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,848
Speaker 1: And you'd think that the game would be sort of boring like after you ran through all the cards.

680
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,310
Speaker 1: well first Of all there's so many expansions.

681
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,738
Speaker 1: You're never gonna run out of cards if you keep buying expansions.

682
00:46:48,758 --> 00:47:01,030
Speaker 1: the second of all even the basic set has so many Freaking cards in it that it's like oh You're never gonna see another one twice and even if you do it'll be in a different context And it could be funny again, or you might have forgotten about it.

683
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:09,250
Speaker 1: It's like it's so much replay value pretty much forever And the game is like really all ages from like you know zero to a million.

684
00:47:09,852 --> 00:47:11,719
Speaker 1: Everyone in the whole world will enjoy this game.

685
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,470
Speaker 1: You can play in any company with anybody.

686
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,477
Speaker 1: It's just the awesome now.

687
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:20,550
Speaker 0: I guess we'll fill out the rest of this episode because this is kind of important one.

688
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:21,690
Speaker 0: There are some variants to the game.

689
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,453
Speaker 0: We'll get into that last.

690
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:31,846
Speaker 0: but first there are some things you should probably do or encourage or some house rules that will Invariably make the game more fun or prevent the game from dragging right.

691
00:47:31,886 --> 00:47:34,477
Speaker 1: well one problem Is that a lot of people will take.

692
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:37,990
Speaker 1: some people will take too long and putting out their red card right now usually?

693
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:40,541
Speaker 1: You know everyone puts one red card per green card.

694
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:42,530
Speaker 1: That's how it works and just don't worry about don't worry about it.

695
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,227
Speaker 1: But if some if people are taking a long time right then the game can be sort of unfun.

696
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:47,869
Speaker 1: cuz like.

697
00:47:47,889 --> 00:47:54,950
Speaker 1: imagine It is ten people playing right one person plays the green card seven people play red cards right away, and three people are going in.

698
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:55,694
Speaker 1: I don't know.

699
00:47:55,734 --> 00:47:58,950
Speaker 1: They're having a hard time deciding and everyone's just sitting and waiting for them.

700
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:59,528
Speaker 1: That's not fun.

701
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:08,521
Speaker 0: So all you have to do is institute the rule of whoever puts the last red card Their card gets handed right the fuck back to them right?

702
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:12,356
Speaker 1: so whoever's the slowest at putting out the red card Just doesn't count you.

703
00:48:12,396 --> 00:48:12,757
Speaker 1: Sorry.

704
00:48:12,998 --> 00:48:13,460
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

705
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:15,590
Speaker 1: How good your red card was you don't even show it to anyone.

706
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,918
Speaker 1: We don't say oh, sorry your last You don't get you don't even get to play a card.

707
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,008
Speaker 0: this turn the key here is don't be a jerk about it.

708
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:25,146
Speaker 0: if it's Real close like a bunch of people go hey don't try to figure out who was last.

709
00:48:25,186 --> 00:48:25,829
Speaker 0: just take them all.

710
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,945
Speaker 1: yeah Because I mean the point is to prevent the game from slowing down from people dragging.

711
00:48:30,247 --> 00:48:34,884
Speaker 1: if everyone rushes You know and put someone down real fast then the game isn't dragging.

712
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:36,510
Speaker 1: so there's no reason to enforce this rule.

713
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,340
Speaker 1: It's you don't need it, and you know.

714
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,265
Speaker 1: so just let it go.

715
00:48:39,285 --> 00:48:40,090
Speaker 1: every card counts.

716
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:48,668
Speaker 0: Yep, now - if someone is the last person and they don't get to play a card It's usually a good idea to let them discard that card and draw a new one.

717
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:49,010
Speaker 0: anyway.

718
00:48:49,332 --> 00:48:53,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think aren't you allowed to discard some cards and draw new ones or something like that.

719
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:53,876
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

720
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:55,108
Speaker 0: I remember the rules don't matter.

721
00:48:55,189 --> 00:49:05,010
Speaker 1: yeah The rules really don't matter because as long as you know everyone's generally you know being fair about the important things like you know You only award one point per turn and everyone only plays one red card.

722
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:06,816
Speaker 1: The rest doesn't you know.

723
00:49:06,997 --> 00:49:11,934
Speaker 1: as long as no one's like sifting through the deck to find the perfect card You know it's a play.

724
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,459
Speaker 1: then the game's gonna work out

725
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:27,663
Speaker 0: now - if you try to play the game for more than an hour Or two it's really gonna start dragging partly because over time you're gonna use your better cards and eventually it's gonna get to the point where pretty much everyone has a handful of unfunny shit.

726
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:30,917
Speaker 0: yep, and Usually that's about the time.

727
00:49:30,937 --> 00:49:35,237
Speaker 0: you want to stop playing if you want to play longer games Or you feel like that's happening.

728
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:37,207
Speaker 0: You should just do a alright.

729
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:40,407
Speaker 0: everyone give in your cards and we're reshuffling.

730
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:46,830
Speaker 0: or Everyone can discard X cards and draw X new cards and just do that all at once and then just continue Or you just stop playing.

731
00:49:46,870 --> 00:50:03,790
Speaker 1: I think in the instruction manual it does suggest that whoever plays last rule to come into effect when the game's going too slow And it also says like how many cards you know points you need to win in a you know a typical game Depending on how many players there are and if you follow that you know you're generally not gonna play a game.

732
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:13,509
Speaker 1: That's so long it becomes unfun because if you just keep playing and playing and playing for a long time Which might be hard to resist you will start to the game will start to get sort of old as you play through.

733
00:50:13,669 --> 00:50:16,590
Speaker 1: you know Similar cards, and you know you start to get tired.

734
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:24,305
Speaker 1: So I recommend playing the game often in Shorter bursts rather than less often and longer verse because that's a way to wear it out now.

735
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:46,128
Speaker 0: also playing it with strangers is fun But the game is extra fun If you play it with people that you are friends with or at least where many of the people playing know at least a few With the other people playing cuz like when we play The there are some trumps like if I play thermonuclear holocaust It's pretty much guaranteed that Katsu was gonna pick that no matter what the adjective is.

736
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:53,069
Speaker 1: yeah I mean it could be you know cute happy scary funny Because for him all of those are true.

737
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,224
Speaker 1: Yeah, so maybe it could be any doesn't matter what the green card is.

738
00:50:56,305 --> 00:50:59,378
Speaker 1: if rim plays that card You know it's gonna get picked.

739
00:50:59,438 --> 00:51:00,261
Speaker 1: He's gonna get a point.

740
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:07,327
Speaker 1: It's like you got the card you got a point congratulations and You know a certain group of friends that happens, and it's sort of a good thing and that it's you know like.

741
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:15,418
Speaker 1: ah yes We all you know join together in our knowing of this thing and you know haha, but in other ways It's kind of like a okay.

742
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:16,404
Speaker 1: That was a waste of return.

743
00:51:16,485 --> 00:51:25,459
Speaker 0: next yep I mean at the same time I wanted to discourage you because playing it with strangers still works because the game is so Fundamentally enjoyable yep, and the car.

744
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:28,170
Speaker 1: you'll lose a lot of that in stuff like if I was playing with strangers.

745
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:37,710
Speaker 1: Grandma's house being scary doesn't work so well, and it works when you got grandma sitting there and her son Who's the father of her grandchildren plays that guy now?

746
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,296
Speaker 0: probably the most important part.

747
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:46,089
Speaker 0: when you're the one with the green card and you have to read like do the red card thing a Lot of people just sit there and like flip through them all like yeah

748
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:57,269
Speaker 1: There are different techniques in sort of being the green card person And you know my technique is I read each one and I sit there and I ponder You know and then I'll pick one and you know something something.

749
00:51:57,329 --> 00:52:04,206
Speaker 0: yes I will definitely read each one give some sort of commentary on it and then lay them out in some sort of arbitrary order.

750
00:52:04,226 --> 00:52:08,410
Speaker 0: yep, and Usually my commentary is like Apples.

751
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:10,336
Speaker 0: what a shitty card.

752
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:11,681
Speaker 0: yep, whoever played.

753
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:14,690
Speaker 0: This is a pretty shitty person that that's not even funny.

754
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:15,453
Speaker 0: What were you thinking?

755
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:19,490
Speaker 1: and then someone will say I had a crowd, but I had nothing better in my hand.

756
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,470
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to get rid of that shit.

757
00:52:20,551 --> 00:52:22,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah But you know you just.

758
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:23,940
Speaker 0: you got no matter what.

759
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,753
Speaker 0: you've got to play it up if you just sit there and read through them yourself.

760
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:32,834
Speaker 1: or just like apples water buffalo like yeah If you just like look look at all the red cards And then say okay this one wins.

761
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:35,102
Speaker 1: that sort of ruins the fun you kind of.

762
00:52:35,343 --> 00:52:37,390
Speaker 1: you got a. you got to figure out a technique.

763
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:43,390
Speaker 1: I mean there are many techniques that are all acceptable But you have to sort of do something you know to sort of liven it up.

764
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,950
Speaker 1: You know in your presentation of the cards to to create the opportunity for their the humor to exist.

765
00:52:49,352 --> 00:52:51,950
Speaker 1: You know I mean the cards do most of the work themselves.

766
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:55,329
Speaker 1: all you have to do is sort of show them and read them and the rest is done.

767
00:52:55,349 --> 00:53:05,357
Speaker 1: as Long as you know you just have to do a little bit of effort in there And it sort of unlocks the potential of the card, but if you do nothing the card will just sit there like yeah I'm not funny because you didn't do anything with me

768
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:05,980
Speaker 0: now.

769
00:53:06,181 --> 00:53:08,290
Speaker 0: There's a variant that works very well.

770
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:14,797
Speaker 0: I mean it can add some meta But the meta only comes into play if your friends are stupid assholes And I don't.

771
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,390
Speaker 0: they had a name for it, but I forget the name.

772
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:30,450
Speaker 0: But I think our friend Idaho is the one who told us about it where instead of doing it anonymously Everyone picks a red card and Then what they do is the green person sits there like a judge and each person will go around robin and pitch their card.

773
00:53:31,072 --> 00:53:34,162
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you'd be like I'm picking this and this is why I'm.

774
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:42,290
Speaker 0: this is my red card like scary and Mahatma Gandhi because a blah blah blah blah blah yep.

775
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:54,230
Speaker 1: And you know the problem with this is of course that I guess people who are better at you know Sort of takes away the game of it becomes more of a game of skill in the skill of you know convincing people.

776
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,430
Speaker 1: You know I could see in that opportunity.

777
00:53:56,872 --> 00:54:04,118
Speaker 1: You wouldn't have people necessarily picking the same person over and over again wanting them to win And you wouldn't really have people picking.

778
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:07,969
Speaker 1: you know the people who are losing in order to keep the game even so that they could.

779
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:09,737
Speaker 1: themselves Can win you know.

780
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:12,530
Speaker 1: but what you'd have is the people are very good at selling.

781
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:15,770
Speaker 1: You know like if there's a salesman in your group was actually good salesman.

782
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:20,630
Speaker 1: They might win a lot even though they might not you know have the best cards and stuff.

783
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:23,502
Speaker 1: It's sort of a different game, but it's still a good game.

784
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:25,110
Speaker 0: It's very fun to play it that way.

785
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,587
Speaker 0: Just it doesn't work if you have shy people.

786
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:29,355
Speaker 1: no It doesn't work with shy people at all.

787
00:54:29,455 --> 00:54:31,944
Speaker 1: shy people be like I pick Apple.

788
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:33,590
Speaker 0: I choose you Snorlax.

789
00:54:33,872 --> 00:54:34,899
Speaker 1: Why did you pick Apple?

790
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:36,208
Speaker 1: I think it fits.

791
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:36,430
Speaker 1: oh?

792
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:39,527
Speaker 0: Stop talking to me.

793
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:46,505
Speaker 1: Well, they're never gonna get any points But that same person who's all shy right if they're playing apples to apples.

794
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:49,590
Speaker 1: this is great for shy people because All they have to do is play a card.

795
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,153
Speaker 1: It's not hard.

796
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:51,782
Speaker 1: even a shy person can play a card.

797
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:54,073
Speaker 1: so they play often The game.

798
00:54:54,334 --> 00:55:04,334
Speaker 1: someone reads their card, and they laugh and then the person reading the card laughs, then they get a point like yeah the game is just Perfect it is Unflawed.

799
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,020
Speaker 0: it is a fantastic game.

800
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,550
Speaker 0: I cannot stress enough that you should all own it.

801
00:55:09,092 --> 00:55:11,160
Speaker 1: Let's see how much the game costs and then get the hell out of here.

802
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:13,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I'm kind of hungry like powerful hungry.

803
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:15,329
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm gonna cook some good stuff.

804
00:55:16,712 --> 00:55:24,831
Speaker 1: Let's see apples to apples on Amazon is currently the party box edition, which is the normal set is $21.99.

805
00:55:24,831 --> 00:55:28,153
Speaker 1: that's So worth it.

806
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:30,820
Speaker 1: the same gate the same game in a wooden box is $30.

807
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,270
Speaker 1: the kids the kids edition is 13.

808
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,935
Speaker 1: The junior 9 plus.

809
00:55:35,975 --> 00:55:41,113
Speaker 1: second edition is 22. the party box expansion 1 is 20.

810
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:47,591
Speaker 1: The Bible editions 24. the Jewish versions only 19.

811
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:50,419
Speaker 1: The customizable blank cards are $5.

812
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:51,803
Speaker 1: expansion 2 is $20.

813
00:55:51,803 --> 00:55:54,330
Speaker 0: Oh customizable blank cards are great.

814
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:58,270
Speaker 1: It comes with a few blank cards in the regular set But then it comes with you.

815
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:59,193
Speaker 1: This is a whole set.

816
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:09,870
Speaker 0: a nice idea is if you have a like a group of friends that you would end up playing with regularly Or if there is say one or two people in your group of friends that is maligned or beloved or anything like that.

817
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:20,290
Speaker 1: Either make cards that are just them or make one card for every person in your group of friends or if you know think about The inside jokes you have with a group of friends and make a card for each inside joke.

818
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,544
Speaker 1: Like we could make a joke like one for mind flare or Cthulhu or something.

819
00:56:23,745 --> 00:56:24,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can make another one.

820
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:29,140
Speaker 1: That's like lift ten blanks Snorlax borlax, you know.

821
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,995
Speaker 1: and if those cards show up It's like all the hands borlax.

822
00:56:32,617 --> 00:56:37,255
Speaker 1: and you know in some ways those cards sort of tweak the game a bit and that if anyone Plays them they'll probably get a point.

823
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:43,378
Speaker 0: but at the same time you're not playing to win you're playing cuz the game is freaking hilarious Exactly exactly, but it's a game.

824
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:44,643
Speaker 1: It's a subjective game.

825
00:56:44,683 --> 00:56:46,430
Speaker 1: You can't really brag if you win.

826
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:48,870
Speaker 1: Well, it's like I wanted a completely subjective game.

827
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:55,816
Speaker 0: You can in one sense and that if you win does normal rules game of apples to apples Consistently in a group of people.

828
00:56:56,478 --> 00:57:06,149
Speaker 0: that means that you on average have a better Understanding of the thought processes of the of your friends in the group than everyone else.

829
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, very important.

830
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:14,997
Speaker 0: That is an argument you could make to some extent but remember on average and in aggregate That is not.

831
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:26,838
Speaker 1: it's not like you have some sort of power It's not like it's gonna unless I guess if you won apples to apples with like straight sets just perfectly Many many times in a row playing with the same people You'd have to win me.

832
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:37,627
Speaker 1: if you won like 15 times in a row Reshuffling the cards every time new cards every time with the same people in straight sets Then I think you might have an argument that you just can read their mind.
