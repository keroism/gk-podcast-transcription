1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,181
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, January 7th, 2014.

2
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,580
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you got it right.

3
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:15,339
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

4
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:16,160
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,200
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Night.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,460
Speaker 1: Scott, I think, was betting with himself on that.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,621
Speaker 1: And tonight, we're talking about the games of MAGFest 11?

8
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,580
Speaker 0: MAGFest 2014.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,540
Speaker 1: The 11th MAGFest.

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,358
Speaker 0: I think it might be more than the 11th MAGFest.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,539
Speaker 1: Maybe the 12th MAGFest.

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,336
Speaker 1: We went to 9, 10-- I don't know.

13
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:34,758
Speaker 0: I think it may have been the 12th.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,000
Speaker 1: The most recent MAGFest.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,727
Speaker 0: 2014 MAGFest.

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,138
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,854
Speaker 1: I'm almost relieved that we don't have any conventions until PAX East.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,239
Speaker 0: You skipped my opening bit.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
Speaker 0: You know what my opening bit is?

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,279
Speaker 1: What was your opening bit?

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:46,709
Speaker 0: Woman?

22
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:48,520
Speaker 1: It's warm today.

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
Speaker 0: It's a little bit warm today.

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,099
Speaker 0: We didn't do anything nice.

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,379
Speaker 0: Only relatively speaking.

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
Speaker 1: Now, I just want to point out that it wasn't that cold in New York.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,400
Speaker 0: Compared to other places, it wasn't as cold in New York.

28
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,280
Speaker 0: It was still fucking cold.

29
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,520
Speaker 1: But it was not below zero Fahrenheit, because growing up in Detroit-- It came close.

30
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,918
Speaker 0: We were in the single digits Fahrenheit.

31
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:10,679
Speaker 1: We hit four.

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,118
Speaker 1: You know what?

33
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,999
Speaker 1: I will admit that four is pretty nippy.

34
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,140
Speaker 0: Only pretty nippy?

35
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,100
Speaker 1: Well, it was funny.

36
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:18,700
Speaker 0: It's ridiculously cold.

37
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:21,071
Speaker 1: So I did not-- my life, I think about these things.

38
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,176
Speaker 1: You have hair.

39
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:24,099
Speaker 1: I do.

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,579
Speaker 1: Hair that I wash in the morning so it gets wet.

41
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,119
Speaker 0: Dry it before you go outside.

42
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,160
Speaker 1: That takes too long.

43
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,699
Speaker 1: You know what I did?

44
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,399
Speaker 1: I did not wash my hair in the morning for three days.

45
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:35,060
Speaker 0: Hair makes a big difference.

46
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,000
Speaker 0: I was really cold.

47
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:36,659
Speaker 1: Also hats.

48
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:42,260
Speaker 1: So when I walked outside, one, I didn't get my hair wet, because a group in Michigan went to school in Rochester.

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,200
Speaker 1: I've experienced frozen head hair.

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Speaker 1: It's not pleasant.

51
00:01:46,582 --> 00:01:49,279
Speaker 1: I get down to the street, and I start walking toward the subway, and there's a cop.

52
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,500
Speaker 1: And he stops a guy who's walking out of his apartment.

53
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:55,279
Speaker 1: And he's like, yo, dog, you should put on a hat.

54
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:57,220
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, what?

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,459
Speaker 1: It's not that cold.

56
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:02,059
Speaker 1: Then he kind of pauses, and the cop's like, you're going to get frostbite.

57
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,540
Speaker 1: And the guy's like, yeah, and he goes back inside.

58
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,120
Speaker 1: But there were actually cops going around telling people.

59
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:16,240
Speaker 1: That was the thing I saw people tweeting about, to put on hats, because it was cold enough to get frostbite if you live too far from the subway.

60
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:17,318
Speaker 0: I did not witness that.

61
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,080
Speaker 1: Maybe it was just your neighborhood?

62
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:19,516
Speaker 1: I don't know.

63
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:23,358
Speaker 1: There's a lot more cops in my neighborhood, because there's that bridge thing right there.

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,294
Speaker 1: Like, there's the cop every day.

65
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,340
Speaker 0: Forcing people-- No, the traffic cops.

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they talk to people.

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,575
Speaker 1: Like, they hang out.

68
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,879
Speaker 0: When I bike in the summer, past traffic cops and crossing guards, they talk to you.

69
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,494
Speaker 0: They try to.

70
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:36,839
Speaker 1: Try to?

71
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,459
Speaker 1: I imagine, yo, asshole, you're the-- hey, you can't go there.

72
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:41,956
Speaker 0: Something like that.

73
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:43,920
Speaker 1: So yeah, we're back.

74
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:44,340
Speaker 1: We're bad.

75
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,398
Speaker 1: I don't expect there'll be that many interruptions to Geek Nights for a few months.

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,798
Speaker 0: PAX East.

77
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,140
Speaker 1: PAX East is in April?

78
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,859
Speaker 0: I thought it was March.

79
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:52,699
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,920
Speaker 1: So why-- it's a ways out.

81
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,699
Speaker 0: Anime Boston.

82
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,978
Speaker 1: Anime Boston, still got to submit panels to.

83
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,160
Speaker 1: What else?

84
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,777
Speaker 1: What other cons?

85
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,120
Speaker 1: PAX Prime, I guess.

86
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,739
Speaker 0: When's Zenkai Con?

87
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,520
Speaker 1: Sometime in the summer.

88
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,038
Speaker 1: I don't know.

89
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,880
Speaker 1: We're committed to going.

90
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,658
Speaker 0: Are we?

91
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,316
Speaker 1: No, yeah.

92
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,239
Speaker 1: We're doing like four panels.

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,659
Speaker 0: I see a bucket.

94
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,980
Speaker 0: Well, I don't see a bucket.

95
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,157
Speaker 0: I see a pail and a word that rhymes with it.

96
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:19,580
Speaker 1: We also-- oh, it's this weekend, maybe?

97
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,071
Speaker 1: I don't know.

98
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,477
Speaker 0: Not doing anything this weekend except watching footballs and maybe baking some breads.

99
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,000
Speaker 1: You want to do some video or some game streaming?

100
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,580
Speaker 0: Does it involve football or warm bread?

101
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:32,460
Speaker 1: I don't know.

102
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,598
Speaker 1: People really-- the antenna videos are starting to get some views.

103
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:35,118
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

104
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:35,799
Speaker 0: We should do that.

105
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,700
Speaker 0: But it's cold.

106
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 1: It's going to be like 50 fucking degrees this weekend.

107
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,417
Speaker 0: It's going to rain.

108
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,100
Speaker 0: It's going to rain.

109
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:42,978
Speaker 1: It is.

110
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,260
Speaker 1: I'm going to bike on Saturday.

111
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,000
Speaker 1: Fuck y'all.

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,580
Speaker 0: I saw a dude biking this morning.

113
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,900
Speaker 1: Scott, two days ago, I was walking home wearing my heaviest jacket thinking to myself, fuck, fuck, walk real slow.

114
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,219
Speaker 1: Don't let the cold air in.

115
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,039
Speaker 1: I saw a dude wearing tights and a ski jacket running.

116
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see people running a lot.

117
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:02,200
Speaker 0: Running is one thing.

118
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,438
Speaker 1: It was six degrees.

119
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,538
Speaker 0: Running heats you up.

120
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,700
Speaker 0: Biking, it's like when you just-- it's like there's a fan blowing on you.

121
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,019
Speaker 0: You're creating your own wind chill.

122
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Speaker 1: So Scott, I know you don't ski, but I'll say one thing.

123
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,639
Speaker 1: When I go skiing-- Same shit happens?

124
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,139
Speaker 1: So the temperature on the ground in the wind during the cold snap in New York was about the temperature I experienced on top of the mountains.

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,779
Speaker 0: Oh, another reason not to ski.

126
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,055
Speaker 0: Cool.

127
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,398
Speaker 1: So the problem is you get to the top of the mountain and it's that cold and it's windy.

128
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,360
Speaker 1: So you start skiing and your face starts to freeze.

129
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,880
Speaker 0: But then you're going down the mountain.

130
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,419
Speaker 0: It's getting warmer.

131
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,279
Speaker 1: So as you're going down, you're getting warmer.

132
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
Speaker 1: And you're exerting yourself.

133
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,517
Speaker 1: So by the bottom, you're so hot you want to take your coat off.

134
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:40,779
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're back.

135
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,659
Speaker 1: All that stuff.

136
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,860
Speaker 1: So I got a Geek Bite.

137
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,679
Speaker 1: I don't know if you have any news or anything.

138
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,278
Speaker 0: I have news.

139
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:49,200
Speaker 1: There's a lot of news, but I'll do my Geek Bite really quick.

140
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,840
Speaker 1: I played The Stanley Parable.

141
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:55,520
Speaker 1: I don't think it's really worth doing a whole show on unless we do a broader topic about that kind of game.

142
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:56,939
Speaker 0: I played the demo.

143
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,220
Speaker 0: That's the one where you walk around the hallways in the Half-Life engine and it just the guy tells you what to do.

144
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, so fuck the demo.

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,800
Speaker 1: Play the full game.

146
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,479
Speaker 1: It added a lot and really, really polished it.

147
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played it a long time ago and then it's ignored.

148
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,200
Speaker 1: If I had to summarize this game, and Scott can talk about it because he played the demo, this is just more than the demo.

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,340
Speaker 0: It's like Bastion, the FPS, without the action.

150
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,940
Speaker 1: You know what it is?

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,079
Speaker 1: It's what Elevator Source should have been.

152
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,340
Speaker 1: It's the same kind of game as Elevator Source.

153
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,140
Speaker 0: It's an experience.

154
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:25,499
Speaker 0: It's a game.

155
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,660
Speaker 0: It's an entertainment software?

156
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Speaker 1: Yes, interactive amusement.

157
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,340
Speaker 1: I would argue that it fits into our definition of ideal game.

158
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:37,499
Speaker 1: Because you play through the game and your decisions affect your personal outcome.

159
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,499
Speaker 1: Play the game again.

160
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,780
Speaker 1: Different decisions make a different outcome.

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,299
Speaker 0: This is only a limited set of outcomes.

162
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, all games have a limited set of outcomes.

163
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:46,119
Speaker 1: The universe has quanta.

164
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,060
Speaker 0: NetHack has an effectively infinite set of outcomes, as does Dwarf Wars.

165
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,420
Speaker 1: But it is technically limited.

166
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:53,440
Speaker 0: Technically.

167
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,220
Speaker 1: There is a limit.

168
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,620
Speaker 1: The Stanley Parable, Scott, the new version, has more outcomes than you would expect.

169
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:00,380
Speaker 1: And they're subtle.

170
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,140
Speaker 0: Does it have more than Chrono Trigger?

171
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,040
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way.

172
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,060
Speaker 1: I played it for two hours, and I saw all the outcomes I cared to, and at no point did anything repeat.

173
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:22,159
Speaker 1: And what amazed me about this game, or I guess what surprised me, I shouldn't say amazed, is the number and variety of ways the narrator would react to things I did that I did not expect him to react to.

174
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:27,680
Speaker 1: And also the fact that in the kind of remade game, there's a very ominous feeling.

175
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,540
Speaker 1: Like, the game almost feels sinister.

176
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,380
Speaker 0: It felt sinister when I played it originally.

177
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,699
Speaker 1: The directions you take and where you go.

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,759
Speaker 1: I don't want to spoil it at all, but it's a game that everyone should experience.

179
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,900
Speaker 1: It is an interactive amusement that is highly amusing.

180
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:49,779
Speaker 1: And the moment that got me, as I walk around, and I'm doing stuff, and basically just this game, you get this experience, and you're walking, and eventually there's a choice.

181
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,397
Speaker 1: There's two doors, and the narrator is kind of describing, "Stanley got up and walked around, "and Stanley decided to go into the door on the

182
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:57,820
Speaker 1: left.".

183
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,199
Speaker 0: - And you don't have to go in the door on the left.

184
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,800
Speaker 1: - And I go into the door on the right, and things go off the rails.

185
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,100
Speaker 0: - Well, just go in the door on the left.

186
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,218
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and if you do that, it's just that.

187
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,200
Speaker 1: So, what surprised me was how reactive the moderator was to me.

188
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,800
Speaker 1: Like, at one point, I walked into a place, and I'm just kind of hanging out in there, looking around, and then the narrator's like, "There's really nothing to do in this room.

189
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,671
Speaker 1: "Stanley really should just get on with his

190
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:20,994
Speaker 1: journey.".

191
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:22,400
Speaker 1: Really?

192
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,898
Speaker 1: You're going to stay in that room?

193
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,020
Speaker 1: Well, fine.

194
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,439
Speaker 1: Stuff happens.

195
00:07:28,002 --> 00:07:34,299
Speaker 1: So, I got to a point where there's a room, and there's a phone, and it's ringing, and it's like, "Stanley was about to embark "on the great journey,".

196
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,739
Speaker 1: and then I understand this long thing.

197
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,500
Speaker 1: So, I see there's a cord, so I run around the room, just click on everything, and I click on the cord, and it just unplugs the phone, and it stops ringing, and then the narrator's like, "Really?

198
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,534
Speaker 1: "Really?

199
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:45,865
Speaker 1: "Well,

200
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:46,112
Speaker 1: fuck.".

201
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,020
Speaker 1: It's really funny.

202
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,719
Speaker 1: It is as funny as Portal, but there isn't a, there's no skill game in there.

203
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,359
Speaker 1: It's Portal without the game part, but with the other game part.

204
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,898
Speaker 1: Because gaming's a lot of things.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,640
Speaker 0: - These people who make these things should stop making entertainment softwares and should just make amusement park places.

206
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,520
Speaker 0: They should just become, what's it called at Disney?

207
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,160
Speaker 0: What's that job?

208
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,259
Speaker 1: - Well, this is that.

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,220
Speaker 0: - Imagineers?

210
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,680
Speaker 1: - In fact, if you took, you could make the Stanley Parable.

211
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,620
Speaker 0: - They should just become Imagineers and quit their video game making ways.

212
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,420
Speaker 1: - Now, here's the thing.

213
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,020
Speaker 1: You could not fully make the Stanley Parable.

214
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,498
Speaker 0: - Or, Imagineers should make entertainment softwares just like this.

215
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:26,020
Speaker 1: - The problem with making the Stanley Parable in the real world is that it uses non-Euclidean geometry heavily.

216
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,720
Speaker 1: There's a lot of places where you'll walk around.

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,499
Speaker 0: - So does the Haunted High Mansion, so.

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Speaker 1: - But it's just, it's tricking you with mirrors and things.

219
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,880
Speaker 1: It's not actually non-Euclidean.

220
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,000
Speaker 1: This is an actually non-Euclidean space.

221
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,000
Speaker 0: - There's plenty of those, every amusement park ride nowadays is just four 3D screens surrounding you anyway.

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,160
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you could do it that way, but that's, the Stanley Parable, I laughed out loud a bunch of times.

223
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,340
Speaker 1: It is super fun.

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,919
Speaker 1: It is well worth interacting with this thing, this ideal game, this interactive series of decisions that gives you a personal outcome that you can repeat.

225
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:04,159
Speaker 1: And once you've played through and you think you're done, go on YouTube and find the endings you didn't find in the game.

226
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,780
Speaker 1: Don't try to save that fucking baby.

227
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,757
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

228
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,020
Speaker 0: - So here's the news, right?

229
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,334
Speaker 0: Apparently there was a dude we never heard of until now, named Greg Martin, and he died.

230
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:22,439
Speaker 0: So I wanna give him some extra recognitions 'cause I saw this on the internet, but I didn't see it on enough internet.

231
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,417
Speaker 0: He's one of those guys--.

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,480
Speaker 1: - Rockin' gospel blues?

233
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,114
Speaker 0: - No.

234
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,220
Speaker 0: One of those--.

235
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,160
Speaker 1: - That's a football player, rugby player?

236
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,497
Speaker 1: - No.

237
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,747
Speaker 1: - Okay, if you like Greg Martin, I'm finding a lot of Greg Martins that aren't your Greg Martin.

238
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,000
Speaker 0: - That's a common name, okay?

239
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:43,399
Speaker 0: He's one of those people that did something really important that you know, but he was unheralded and unrecognized for his great works.

240
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:50,259
Speaker 0: And you know, it's like, well, we should recognize his great works, even though we are too late.

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,719
Speaker 1: - Is it this DeviantArt guy?

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,714
Speaker 0: - No.

243
00:09:55,061 --> 00:10:02,440
Speaker 0: He is the guy who did lots and lots of video game box art in your childhood, and you didn't even realize.

244
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:15,880
Speaker 0: For example, Little Nemo Dream Master NES, Pac-Man Game Boy, Snow Brothers NES, Adventure Island Game Boy, Felix the Cat NES, Sonic 2.

245
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,560
Speaker 1: - Oh man, Sonic 2.

246
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:27,300
Speaker 0: - Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman, DuckTales 2, Flintstones, he did all the art for all these video game boxes.

247
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:41,416
Speaker 0: Pac-Attack SNES, Tengen Pac-Man, NES Pac-Man, Sonic Spinball, a lot of Sonic box art, Bomberman's, Time Gal, Arrow the Acrobat, and there's a whole thread-- - Et cetera.

248
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:54,019
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there's a whole thread here on Nintendo Age Forum that shows all his box arts, and once you see the box arts, you're like, that guy, all those boxes look the same, oh my God, that art.

249
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,860
Speaker 1: - I guess we have to add to the Google juice so that he'll pop up over all these rugby players and things.

250
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,110
Speaker 0: - Exactly, so yeah.

251
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:09,880
Speaker 0: Now the thing is, what this makes me wanna do is not only to recognize and remember him and his great and memorable box art-- - But to figure out other people who do box art?

252
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:21,377
Speaker 0: - To find other video game box art artists from back in the day, or we don't know the Atari guy, I forget his name, right, who did all the pitfalls and all those ones, and then the Breakout guy who did all those ones.

253
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:28,110
Speaker 0: I actually saw, I think I saw a video of that guy doing the super Breakout live sketching or whatever, anyway.

254
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:41,480
Speaker 0: Like yeah, there should be some more recognition of video game box artists from the '80s, '90s, early 2000s, not anyone who's doing it today, they can shove it, they just use their computer.

255
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:43,519
Speaker 0: They can't.

256
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Speaker 1: - So things of the day.

257
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:56,400
Speaker 1: This video is just kind of amazing and so enjoyable.

258
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,719
Speaker 1: I can't, you just all need to watch it.

259
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,800
Speaker 1: This is Story Wars.

260
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:03,738
Speaker 0: It's an animation-- - Sure we didn't already do this?

261
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,699
Speaker 1: - I couldn't find any example of us having done it.

262
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,600
Speaker 1: I've searched multiple times in multiple venues.

263
00:12:13,522 --> 00:12:25,320
Speaker 1: So Story War, this is actually on cartoon hangover, and basically this is an animation of the kind of stories that come out of Story War, the game.

264
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:34,048
Speaker 1: And it kind of makes, it's kind of an ad for Story War, but it's a really good ad because it's really funny and I really like the style.

265
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:37,895
Speaker 1: and this is the kind of show that I would watch if it was a show.

266
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,031
Speaker 1: In the being puppy cat, Dr.

267
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:48,439
Speaker 1: Lollipop, bravest warriors, it's in that genre almost, but with a little twist of slayers.

268
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,960
Speaker 0: - Definitely a twist of slayers.

269
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,740
Speaker 1: - This thing is great and you need to watch it.

270
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,020
Speaker 0: - Doesn't make me want to play the game though.

271
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:56,660
Speaker 1: - I haven't actually played the game.

272
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:58,960
Speaker 0: The thing is-- - I'd say it doesn't make me want to play the game.

273
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,399
Speaker 0: - Every-- - I'm not saying the game is bad.

274
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,340
Speaker 1: - Every game that makes stories that I've seen has not been as good as old nanofictionary.

275
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,940
Speaker 1: No one talks about nanofictionary.

276
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,076
Speaker 0: - Nanofictionary.

277
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,040
Speaker 1: - Pretty sure we've done a show on nanofictionary.

278
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,253
Speaker 1: - So good.

279
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,079
Speaker 1: - But yeah, watch this thing, it's great.

280
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:14,320
Speaker 0: - So, Space Dandy.

281
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,660
Speaker 1: - Space Dandy.

282
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,400
Speaker 0: - Is gonna save anime, or supposedly is gonna save anime.

283
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,480
Speaker 0: Watch the first episode, not bad, not bad at all.

284
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,900
Speaker 1: - Too late, Kill La Kill already saved anime.

285
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,798
Speaker 0: - Sure, everything that saves anime is saving it with boobies.

286
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:29,920
Speaker 1: But anyway.

287
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,520
Speaker 1: - I love how as the opening, if that keeps going on, the boobies are just boobying and boobying more and more and more.

288
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,099
Speaker 0: - So, you know, Japan gets all the video games we don't get.

289
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,619
Speaker 0: And mostly we concentrate on the unreleased console games that Japan gets that we don't get.

290
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,534
Speaker 0: Especially DS games, and mostly Nintendo games.

291
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,337
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

292
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,180
Speaker 0: - But, Japan actually gets tons and tons of mobile phone games that we never get here ever.

293
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:07,840
Speaker 0: And no one seems to care about that at all, even though some of them are probably really awesome, especially if you care about licensed properties that are Japanese.

294
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,694
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's plenty of crayon shin-chan phone games you could get that we don't have, right?

295
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,579
Speaker 0: But, we're never gonna have 'em.

296
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,459
Speaker 0: So, no elephant dance for us.

297
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:24,400
Speaker 0: So, here's a commercial for one such game, Space Galaga.

298
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:26,890
Speaker 0: Which is Space Dandy?

299
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:28,379
Speaker 0: Galaga for your phone.

300
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,540
Speaker 1: - It looks really stylish.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,380
Speaker 0: - Basically, it looks like Galaga for your phone, but Space Dandy, how come we don't have that here?

302
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:37,879
Speaker 0: Hello?

303
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,020
Speaker 0: This is why you guys in America-- - Well, Space Dandy did just come out.

304
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,140
Speaker 0: - Right, but this is why you guys in America don't make money on the animes, 'cause you're trying to just make money on the animes.

305
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,380
Speaker 0: You gotta bring out every single thing that's related to, that's just how the Japanese-- - More importantly, you've gotta bring it out right the fuck away.

306
00:14:53,080 --> 00:15:01,180
Speaker 0: - I remember when Madoka Magica-- - That's how they're making money on Space Dandy in Japan, 'cause they're putting out phone games and toys and toothbrushes and the whole shitload, right?

307
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,464
Speaker 1: - Even in the

308
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:01,525
Speaker 1: U.S.,

309
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:04,399
Speaker 1: remember way, way back when My Little Pony turned into the big thing?

310
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:09,659
Speaker 1: It was a while before there were things to sell, so you know who makes money off of you?

311
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,780
Speaker 1: If you try to make money off of a show and not of the merchandise, people who illegally bootleg stuff with your IP on it in artist alleys.

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,120
Speaker 0: - Right, make the shit and bring the shit out immediately.

313
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,085
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, Space Dandy, the first episode aired in the U.S.

314
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 0: first, but they got the Space Galaga already developed, already on their phones.

315
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:31,100
Speaker 0: right the hell now, and people here don't even know that it exists.

316
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,779
Speaker 1: - It's our roles.

317
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,455
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:41,319
Speaker 1: - So, in the meta moment, thank you all who came to MagFest and the four panels that Scott and I were on, especially the people who showed up at 10 fucking a.m.

319
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:42,860
Speaker 1: for our bad games panel.

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,419
Speaker 0: - Seriously, why would you do that?

321
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,640
Speaker 1: - Also, that mage's room was kind of in the back, and on the map, we're like, oh shit, is this tiny fucking room in the middle of nowhere?

322
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:50,863
Speaker 1: But no.

323
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,739
Speaker 0: - It wasn't that tiny.

324
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,140
Speaker 1: - The room was pretty big, and it actually was rocking the entire con.

325
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,278
Speaker 0: - Yeah, people were into it.

326
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,218
Speaker 0: It seemed like there were certain people, like that's what they were there for.

327
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,680
Speaker 0: Which was interesting.

328
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,880
Speaker 1: - Notice how the panel attendance has really gone up as they've pushed the academic stuff over the media, guests.

329
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,919
Speaker 0: - Super Art Fight was in a bigger room, and it was really crowded in there.

330
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,640
Speaker 1: - Yeah, MagFest is on the upswing, but I think MagFest is gonna have a cap next year, because-- - We'll see what happens.

331
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,599
Speaker 1: - We'll see what happens.

332
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:22,120
Speaker 1: So MagFest, you were great, everyone who came to see us at MagFest, you were great.

333
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:27,880
Speaker 1: If you wanted to play a game with us, we didn't play a game with you, I'm sorry, I was drunk and wandering around a lot.

334
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,718
Speaker 1: I might have said, "Yeah, I'll see you

335
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:30,960
Speaker 1: later.".

336
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,460
Speaker 1: I was probably drunk and I don't remember.

337
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,579
Speaker 1: Also, hot tub party.

338
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:37,488
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

339
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,880
Speaker 0: - Any other meta things?

340
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,818
Speaker 1: - The Book Club book is and was.

341
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,788
Speaker 1: - I do.

342
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:42,620
Speaker 1: - I do, we're done with it.

343
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,220
Speaker 0: - I finished reading it like yesterday.

344
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,938
Speaker 1: - Finally, I read two full books since I finished it.

345
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,600
Speaker 0: - All right, we'll see.

346
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:50,079
Speaker 1: - Two more Ian M. Banks books.

347
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,671
Speaker 0: - Oh, okay.

348
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:51,711
Speaker 0: -

349
00:16:51,792 --> 00:17:06,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I might, I almost want to make the next Book Club book that wool book that listeners keep giving us copies of, and then we got more copies of at that charity dinner we went to at PAX Prime, because today, the CTO of my company is like, "Oh, hey, we're in,

350
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:06,757
Speaker 1: Bob.".

351
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,720
Speaker 1: So there's a book, and I know you really like good sci-fi, that I just read, and it's great, and it was that book.

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,307
Speaker 1: - It was wool?

353
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,140
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it was wool.

354
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,711
Speaker 0: - Is it about sheep?

355
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,459
Speaker 0: - I don't know.

356
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,839
Speaker 0: - Are androids dreaming of them?

357
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,939
Speaker 1: - I don't know, I've got five physical copies of it, because people keep giving them to me.

358
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:25,920
Speaker 1: One of them is signed by the author.

359
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,762
Speaker 0: - Okay.

360
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:31,140
Speaker 1: - So I guess, I don't know, I might make some dry history of my book instead.

361
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:39,979
Speaker 0: - At work, they gave away free copies of Fosse, if you want, which is pretty sure is a biography or something, it's a giant book, I could make that a Book Club book.

362
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,345
Speaker 0: - No.

363
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,620
Speaker 0: - I didn't even take my free copy, because who the hell wants it?

364
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:50,440
Speaker 1: - A company I do business with in Turkey gave me, as a gift, this huge, gigantic history book of a particular city in the old Roman Empire.

365
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,618
Speaker 0: - They know that much history, huh?

366
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,460
Speaker 1: - That book looks really, really good.

367
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:04,774
Speaker 1: And also, Emily's mom gave me a book that is titled Strategy, and so far, it is the kind of book that Scott and I will love and you will all hate.

368
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,440
Speaker 1: - Okay.

369
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,580
Speaker 1: - It is, take Characteristics of Games and go way more academic and way more historical.

370
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,100
Speaker 1: It's up our alley, it's also really fucking thick.

371
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,805
Speaker 0: - All right.

372
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:20,360
Speaker 1: - Join our forum, it's awesome, it's rocking again, now that the holidays are over.

373
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,680
Speaker 0: - Think about everything that there is on the internet, every protocol on the internet for communicating, right?

374
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,979
Speaker 0: That you can think of, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, social networks, IRCs, forums.

375
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,158
Speaker 1: - Gopher, what about gopher?

376
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:32,826
Speaker 1: Gopher.

377
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,500
Speaker 1: - Not gopher.

378
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,488
Speaker 1: - Gopher, no gopher.

379
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:38,720
Speaker 0: - All right, websites, everything that you, YouTubes, everything.

380
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,700
Speaker 0: We are there, come and find us in those places.

381
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,419
Speaker 1: - We're not on BitTorrent anymore.

382
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,388
Speaker 1: - Steam groups.

383
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:47,578
Speaker 1: - Those old torrents stopped working a long time ago.

384
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,006
Speaker 1: - Right, I mean.

385
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:48,964
Speaker 1: - If you can even find the trackers.

386
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,698
Speaker 0: - You can email us, geekknights@frontrecruit.com.

387
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:54,155
Speaker 0: There are so many ways.

388
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:54,820
Speaker 1: - Actually, a listener.

389
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,090
Speaker 0: - To communicate with us and the other people who listen to this show.

390
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,120
Speaker 1: - I have not looked at it yet.

391
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,240
Speaker 0: - You have to take advantage of at least some of them.

392
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,779
Speaker 1: - I have not looked at it yet, a listener sent us a video question once I watched it.

393
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:11,932
Speaker 0: - I watched it, it's the guy from Australia, who is, I already emailed, I answered him in YouTube, but I'll address it anyway.

394
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:14,220
Speaker 1: - Well, I didn't watch the video yet, so you can't, no spoilers.

395
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,700
Speaker 0: - This is a Tuesday show, right?

396
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,715
Speaker 0: - Yeah, no spoilers.

397
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:17,852
Speaker 0: - All right, so it's game related.

398
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,549
Speaker 1: - I was gonna do a video answer.

399
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:26,548
Speaker 0: - No, so remember-- in Australia, and we played Blockus and Hanabi-- - Oh, it's the smart couple.

400
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,039
Speaker 0: - Right, yeah, so--.

401
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,126
Speaker 1: - They were really smart.

402
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:34,660
Speaker 0: - The dude, his name's Bane, I guess it's his real name, which is fuckin' awesome, his real name's Bane, hell yeah.

403
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,378
Speaker 0: - Hello, Batman.

404
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,999
Speaker 1: You haven't even seen that movie, you don't know what I'm referencing.

405
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,620
Speaker 0: - I know who Bane is, though, 'cause I watched Batman the Animated Series.

406
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,040
Speaker 1: - Do you know his funny voice?

407
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,748
Speaker 1: I don't--.

408
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,812
Speaker 0: - I thought he talks like the way in the South Park episode, with the--.

409
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:51,045
Speaker 1: - It's hard to describe his accent.

410
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,417
Speaker 0: - You're talking more like Inspector Gadget.

411
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,659
Speaker 1: - That would be, move the clown to the other button.

412
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,754
Speaker 1: - That's what you're doing, right.

413
00:19:58,621 --> 00:19:59,700
Speaker 0: You're not doing a Bane voice.

414
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:10,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he made a, he didn't need to make a video to ask this question, basically the question he was asking is, his partner, right, they're playing more games now, since, you know, PAXOS, right?

415
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,450
Speaker 0: More better games.

416
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,117
Speaker 1: - Ooh, steppin' it up.

417
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:20,080
Speaker 0: - But, the games they play, the game he was using, an example is a game called Cuba that we never played, but we don't need to know how to play it.

418
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:39,140
Speaker 0: In Cuba, sometimes, 'cause it's a game, right, you can make a move where you'll get four points, or you can make a move where you'll get three points, but other people might lose points, right, so it's like, you know, and basically, his partner doesn't like games where you attack people.

419
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,671
Speaker 1: - Welcome to the world of direct fucking, AKA highly political.

420
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:46,959
Speaker 0: - So my answer was, I don't know how to change a person's personality, sorry.

421
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:47,896
Speaker 0: The end.

422
00:20:48,620 --> 00:21:02,280
Speaker 1: - The real answer is, if you want to play competitive games and want to get good at them, you have to either only play two player games, or be able to accept that you will lose due to politics.

423
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,820
Speaker 0: - No, but it's like, he wants to know how to make her accept that she will lose to politics, and I was like, she won't.

424
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,119
Speaker 1: - I was talking at her, not you.

425
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,528
Speaker 1: I remember our friend Luke, not Luke Crane, different Luke, way back, when we were first getting into German board games.

426
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,240
Speaker 0: - But he was the one asking.

427
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,940
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well I'm saying we started playing El Grande.

428
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,959
Speaker 1: Like, that was our first real, real German board game after, like, Settlers and Carcassonne.

429
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,320
Speaker 1: Like, that was the first, like, wooden cubes game.

430
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,439
Speaker 1: That's where we went, like, full on after that.

431
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:31,940
Speaker 1: And I remember, there was a moment when I had this realization.

432
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:40,760
Speaker 1: I was playing the game, and I realized, wait a minute, I can do this and get three points, or I can do this, get two points, and deny Luke four points.

433
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:53,960
Speaker 1: Luke is winning by one point, and can get two points on his turn, and I did all the math, and I did the series of actions that was guaranteed to win me the game, and he got really fucking pissed.

434
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,280
Speaker 0: - Right, there's no way to change that person.

435
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:08,520
Speaker 0: If you are that person, maybe you can change yourself, but as being another person, if you are not that person who is upset at people hurting each other in games, then you can't change someone else's personality.

436
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,719
Speaker 1: You just have to-- - You know how I've gotten around that?

437
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,178
Speaker 0: Play two-player games, because-- - Or don't play with, yeah, but he wants to play the multiplayer games.

438
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,059
Speaker 1: - No, no, you've got to get someone to be able to play those games.

439
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:27,679
Speaker 1: You have to get that person to play two-player games a lot, where there is no difference between getting three points or getting two points and denying one point.

440
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:44,900
Speaker 1: So that will, if you play two-player games a lot, that have direct attacks and aren't just races, and you have that differential, that is the most intuitive way to make it clear that hurting someone else is the same as helping yourself, and you cannot discriminate between the two.

441
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,640
Speaker 1: They're identical.

442
00:22:46,580 --> 00:23:00,219
Speaker 0: - I don't, it's just, I think people, some people have a personality such that, where if someone's points go down, theirs or another's, right, it's like they don't want to see anyone harmed, even within the context of a game where no one's actually being harmed.

443
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,420
Speaker 0: It's like that just upsets them, that there is harm, whether they caused it or someone else caused it.

444
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:13,780
Speaker 0: - But I guess I've seen people-- And they just, those people, I've never seen a person who was that kind of person that didn't like that come around and become a person who likes it.

445
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,520
Speaker 1: - Many of our friends who are women have had that problem in the past.

446
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Speaker 0: - I think most people have this problem, actually.

447
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,040
Speaker 0: Regardless of gender.

448
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:42,139
Speaker 1: - But I have seen people get over it, and the best way I can think of, 'cause I don't have a shared way, just based on my experience, if you want any chance at all, you have to play two-player games where both things happen, and that is the only way to reinforce viscerally that, oh, these are the same thing.

449
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,760
Speaker 0: Or-- - I think some people just don't, they have a higher priority than winning.

450
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,859
Speaker 0: They don't care, right?

451
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,757
Speaker 0: - Or, or, or!

452
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,480
Speaker 0: - They just can't make them care about winning as much as--.

453
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,079
Speaker 1: - Here's the other way.

454
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,618
Speaker 1: Play a game like Bonanza.

455
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,660
Speaker 0: Because Bonanza is-- - The fucking is concealed?

456
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:12,180
Speaker 1: - Well, it's extremely political, but it's so interactive that it sort of glosses over the fact that it's actually extremely political, and that could also-- - People don't know that they've been harmed, 'cause it's not obvious that you lose 10 points.

457
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:19,039
Speaker 1: - But eventually, if they keep playing, they might start to notice, or start to not notice when it happens more directly in more complex games.

458
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:34,460
Speaker 0: - Another thing is, if you're a game designer, right, and you notice that certain people get upset when someone loses a victory point, you could just renumber your game such that, let's say there's a move I could do where I get five and Rim loses one.

459
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:40,180
Speaker 0: You could just change it so that in that situation, I get six and Rim gets zero, 'cause it's effectively no different.

460
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,420
Speaker 1: - That is complex with multiplayer games.

461
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,700
Speaker 0: - Of course, but if you could somehow do, you know, rejigger the mathematics of your game to do that, then no one would get upset because no one's losing points.

462
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:57,340
Speaker 1: - I think they would still get upset because they would start to perceive the direct actions that get a lot of points as being unfair.

463
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,440
Speaker 0: - Yeah, maybe.

464
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,719
Speaker 1: - They would, in fact, I think it would cause almost the same effect.

465
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,340
Speaker 0: - Maybe, but I think there's just something about losing something, right, having your shit messed up.

466
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, case in point, you've all gotten zars before.

467
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,280
Speaker 1: That's the worst thing in the fucking world.

468
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,518
Speaker 0: - Mario Party the zar.

469
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,579
Speaker 1: - Oh my God, remember the double zar that fucked us in the tournament, lost us the belt?

470
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,210
Speaker 1: - That's right.

471
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:17,560
Speaker 1: - That happens.

472
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,678
Speaker 0: - It happens, okay.

473
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,820
Speaker 0: Let's talk about games we played at MAGFest.

474
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,420
Speaker 1: - All right, MAGFest was four days of gaming, not gonna talk about every game we played.

475
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,339
Speaker 1: - Were you not there?

476
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:28,999
Speaker 0: Why weren't you there?

477
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,608
Speaker 1: - Yeah, seriously.

478
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,138
Speaker 1: - You must suck.

479
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,758
Speaker 1: - Listen, I understand--.

480
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,460
Speaker 0: - There's no other explanation for not being there.

481
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,520
Speaker 1: - I understand if you don't fly from America to PAX Australia.

482
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,260
Speaker 0: - I understand if you don't fly from Mozambique to MAGFest.

483
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,091
Speaker 1: That is acceptable.

484
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:45,520
Speaker 1: - I understand if you don't fly to PAX Prime 'cause you don't live on the West Coast.

485
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,820
Speaker 0: - Well, if you don't have tickets, right, it's understandable.

486
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,968
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I understand if you don't go to PAX East 'cause it's sold out.

487
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:50,879
Speaker 1: - MAGFest is not sold out.

488
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,930
Speaker 1: - MAGFest had no cap.

489
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,760
Speaker 0: - And it's four days and it's New Year's, you're on vacation anyway.

490
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:57,571
Speaker 0: And it's not that crowded.

491
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:00,675
Speaker 1: - MAGFest is the best non-Pax convention ever.

492
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:01,440
Speaker 0: - Period.

493
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,780
Speaker 1: - So, MAGFest was awesome.

494
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,799
Speaker 1: We played a lot of games, played a lot of Dig Dug.

495
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,340
Speaker 0: Scott and I were neck and neck on this one machine, but then-- - It only keeps the top five scores and some other dude comes and blows us out of the water.

496
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:14,720
Speaker 0: so we don't know what our scores are.

497
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,759
Speaker 1: - All right, D_T, you had two orders of magnitude higher score than me.

498
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,140
Speaker 0: - I don't know what the hell he's doing.

499
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,627
Speaker 0: - Winning.

500
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,252
Speaker 0: - I'm gonna go practice me some Dig Dug.

501
00:26:23,272 --> 00:26:24,389
Speaker 1: - I'm gonna practice some fucking Dig Dug.

502
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:28,060
Speaker 0: - That's some bullshit because I said I was gonna practice Mike Tyson's punch shot, I didn't do that either.

503
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,536
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I did some of the challenges and it was fun.

504
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,360
Speaker 1: I played a lot of Dig Dug.

505
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,580
Speaker 1: I played a lot of that weird eyes game that's like Pac-Man was shooting.

506
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,104
Speaker 0: - What?

507
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,139
Speaker 1: - You didn't see that?

508
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,564
Speaker 1: - No.

509
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:40,599
Speaker 1: - You're a floating eyeball on a Pac-Man board.

510
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,758
Speaker 1: There's pills to pick up and you pick them up by shooting them.

511
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,320
Speaker 1: There's other eyes flying around.

512
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,419
Speaker 1: If they see you, they shoot at you and you can shoot them.

513
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,599
Speaker 1: You pick up the things by shooting at them.

514
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,400
Speaker 1: If the other eyes shoot you, you die.

515
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:56,199
Speaker 1: It's really hard because if there's pills between you and the eye, you shoot at it, you hit the pill, its beam hits you.

516
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,264
Speaker 0: - I played Magical Drop 3.

517
00:26:59,264 --> 00:27:00,919
Speaker 0: There were a lot of Magical Drop people there.

518
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,558
Speaker 0: You know what else?

519
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,459
Speaker 1: - The same motherfuckers around the initial D machine the entire con, I didn't even bother.

520
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,537
Speaker 0: - You know what else?

521
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,820
Speaker 0: Apparently, there's a game called Windjammers which is sort of like Frisbee volleyball, Frisbee tennis.

522
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:13,939
Speaker 0: It's for Neo Geo.

523
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,919
Speaker 0: So the Magical Drop machine was frequently a Windjammers machine 'cause it's Neo Geo, right?

524
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:29,538
Speaker 0: But, Giant Bomb, that podcast video show we don't watch and whatever, but we know exists, they have made Windjammers ridiculously popular for some reason.

525
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,900
Speaker 0: So during MAGFest, all these bros are playing Windjammers like crazy and I was like, what the fuck?

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,179
Speaker 0: Get away from my Magical Drops.

527
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,360
Speaker 0: We wanna drop some magic balls on your heads.

528
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,157
Speaker 0: Stop throwing the discs.

529
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
Speaker 1: - We never got, there was an Araki table.

530
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:43,940
Speaker 1: we never got a chance to use.

531
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,259
Speaker 1: - Justice.

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,880
Speaker 1: - There was an Artemis Space Bridge that Emily and a bunch of our friends played.

533
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,658
Speaker 0: - Yep.

534
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,420
Speaker 1: - They got nuked and had some trouble.

535
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:53,418
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna play some of that in the near future with our crew.

536
00:27:55,563 --> 00:27:59,539
Speaker 1: But the games we played that we wanna talk about are the tabletop games.

537
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,278
Speaker 0: - That's right.

538
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,580
Speaker 1: - 'Cause there really aren't new console games that we haven't already talked about.

539
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,680
Speaker 0: - So there's one game, the big one, right?

540
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,959
Speaker 0: It's one that I've heard about for many moons but I've never had a chance to play.

541
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:11,980
Speaker 0: but I've heard it oftenly spoke.

542
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:17,299
Speaker 0: It is maybe one of the highest ranking board game geek games I haven't played or, you know, and--.

543
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,580
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's also a hundred fucking dollars on Amazon.

544
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,760
Speaker 0: - Right, the game is called Hansa to Tonica.

545
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,440
Speaker 1: - So if I had to analogize it after looking at it and learning the rules, wrong twice.

546
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:31,460
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

547
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,520
Speaker 0: - Talk about getting rules wrong.

548
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,776
Speaker 0: This is the worst case of wrong rule ever, ever.

549
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:47,376
Speaker 1: - I like the point that there were multiple people in one game who were all playing on a radically different assumption because different other sets of people who weren't playing told them wrong.

550
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:49,540
Speaker 0: And all of those people were wrong.

551
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,719
Speaker 0: - One person read the rules, another person super read the rules, right?

552
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,079
Speaker 0: Y'all got it wrong.

553
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,680
Speaker 1: - The game feels a lot like some aspects of Thurn in Texas, some aspects of Web of Power.

554
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,660
Speaker 0: - See, the thing is those are games that I am A+ at and those aspects I did not have in this game.

555
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,280
Speaker 0: - Yeah, this game-- - Partially because of wrong rule.

556
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:22,439
Speaker 1: - Has extremely obscured positional heuristics to the point that it is almost impossible for a novice player to have any concept of how well they're doing until the game ends.

557
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,740
Speaker 1: And they will also not likely see the end of the game approaching.

558
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,420
Speaker 0: - Nope, unless it's the victory point kind.

559
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,519
Speaker 0: That one's easy to see.

560
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:35,780
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but even then they might not notice because the victory points seem to not get to that point usually.

561
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:44,520
Speaker 0: - Basically what it is, it's a game where you're basically putting guys on roads similar to Ticket to Ride, but you have to sort of fight to control the roads and some roads are better than others.

562
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,399
Speaker 1: - But controlling a road means you pick up all your guys and then interact with one of the end points of the road.

563
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,060
Speaker 0: - Finishing a road allows you to put a real guy on the board, which is hard, right?

564
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:56,160
Speaker 0: And then the real guys, it would actually matter.

565
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,015
Speaker 1: - But they're limited power grid style in where they can go.

566
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:06,740
Speaker 1: There's multiple kinds of guys and the places they can interact with not only are limited but are radically different.

567
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:10,000
Speaker 1: Like you put a guy in one spot and you control the office.

568
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,999
Speaker 1: You'll get victory points when other people will finish routes that touch that.

569
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:22,318
Speaker 1: Or you can put it on the action thing and then like get more actions, get more workers to place later, or upgrade your bag or upgrade all these things you've got on your little thingy.

570
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,279
Speaker 0: - But really what makes it hard to figure out is the side effects.

571
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
Speaker 0: It's like upgrading the book, for example, right?

572
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:32,800
Speaker 0: So if you build a road in a certain place you can upgrade your book, right?

573
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:38,898
Speaker 0: Okay, if you upgrade your book then when you use the airlift action you can airlift more dudes.

574
00:30:39,482 --> 00:30:44,538
Speaker 0: But at the same time you also get another merchant 'cause you upgraded your book.

575
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:57,240
Speaker 0: So it's like all these, when you do something it actually has like crazy side effects all over the place and certain things you need really badly that go with other things you don't need so badly and vice versa all over the place.

576
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:02,740
Speaker 0: So there isn't like this clear path of do these things in this order for optimal efficiency.

577
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,479
Speaker 0: It's like, oh I can just go get more, everyone is trying to get more actions 'cause that was so obviously good.

578
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:16,180
Speaker 0: But it's like, wait a minute, if I upgrade my bag that's effectively getting more actions 'cause I'll have to take less bag actions and can do more non-bag actions.

579
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,980
Speaker 1: - But in the game I played--.

580
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,220
Speaker 0: - 'Cause my bag is more efficient.

581
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,860
Speaker 1: - Because of counter attacks I was able to do what I wanted with almost no bagging at any point.

582
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:34,880
Speaker 1: So the game is very reactive in that you can put your guys out on the road but if you have guys out that haven't finished a road other people can spend more guys to displace your guys.

583
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,680
Speaker 1: but then you get kinda like double guys.

584
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,840
Speaker 1: So if I displace one of Scott's guys he gets to put two guys on a nearby road.

585
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,140
Speaker 0: - Then I can use the airlift to just move the guys that I've now gotten free extra guys.

586
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:56,460
Speaker 1: - So you see this strategy where people will put a guy in the way of someone else hoping to get displaced and that person might then not displace them because it would displace them somewhere that would fuck up their shit elsewhere.

587
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,279
Speaker 0: - And now your guys are all trapped and shit.

588
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,820
Speaker 1: - Yeah or--.

589
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,800
Speaker 0: - 'Cause they're just hanging out there not being displaced.

590
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,259
Speaker 1: - Or you displace, someone else displace, you have a displaced cascade over multiple rounds because people are getting all these guys on the board from being displaced.

591
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:18,600
Speaker 1: The board can change so radically between one turn and the next that you gotta rethink your whole strategy but the actions you take are extremely simple.

592
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,840
Speaker 0: - Yeah there's only what, five actions you can take?

593
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,440
Speaker 0: Bag, put guys, airlift guys, claim and something else?

594
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,899
Speaker 1: - Something like that.

595
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,120
Speaker 0: - Yeah and then on your turn you get what, two actions?

596
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,299
Speaker 1: - I only played it once.

597
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,020
Speaker 1: I gotta read the rules in detail.

598
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,000
Speaker 0: - It's a game I definitely wanna play again but I think it has a lot of long-term play possibilities.

599
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,293
Speaker 0: - Yes.

600
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,700
Speaker 0: - But I think Tammany Hall, I wanna play again more.

601
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,720
Speaker 1: - I wanna play that too.

602
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,120
Speaker 0: - I wanna play that more than I wanna play Hans Doutanika but I foresee it having less long-term possibilities.

603
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:58,178
Speaker 0: I think it'd be more like fun while it lasts but I think Hans Doutanika could become a game you play for a long time.

604
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:03,638
Speaker 0: But I feel Hans Doutanika felt a lot similar to Brass which I have.

605
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,920
Speaker 0: So it's like I already have Brass, I don't need to buy that one.

606
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,940
Speaker 1: - I would buy Hans Doutanika if they weren't 100 bucks on Amazon.

607
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,560
Speaker 0: - Well I'll go check it at the Strad.

608
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,017
Speaker 1: - That's what I'm gonna do, you never know.

609
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,756
Speaker 1: - You never know, you never know.

610
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:29,459
Speaker 1: This game however, in the early days before we got into German board gaming culture and just played these games on our own, the way we'd learn is we'd all independently read the rule book and then we'd play.

611
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,860
Speaker 1: Then we got into the board gaming culture which is very much a culture of the oral tradition.

612
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,380
Speaker 0: - People don't wanna read rules.

613
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,539
Speaker 0: For some reason reading rules is not fun and people don't wanna do it.

614
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,820
Speaker 1: - So most people learn board games by having someone else teach them.

615
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,140
Speaker 0: - And they get the rules fucking wrong.

616
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,160
Speaker 1: - Yeah, one asshole gets the rules wrong, teaches 100 other assholes and then you'll have an entire generation playing a game wrong.

617
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,399
Speaker 0: - 'Cause of one guy who's illiterate.

618
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,940
Speaker 1: - Nevermind games that have rules changes.

619
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,540
Speaker 1: - Glory, oh not Glory to Rome.

620
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,879
Speaker 1: Seven Wonders has some of that, there's different copies of the rule book that say different things in certain key areas.

621
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,438
Speaker 1: Carcassonne has no less than three completely different ways to score farmers depending on what rule book you have.

622
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,478
Speaker 0: - I've never met a person who is new to Netrunner that plays it properly from the get go.

623
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,580
Speaker 1: - That's just how it goes.

624
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,440
Speaker 0: - They're like, oh if it doesn't have it in the run, do I still have to break this ice?

625
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,599
Speaker 0: It's like no, just keep going.

626
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,518
Speaker 1: - I am now going to fully read the rule book of any game, even if someone teaches it to me.

627
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:29,078
Speaker 1: 'Cause there are a lot of games I play that I've never read the rule book for.

628
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,818
Speaker 0: - Oh yeah.

629
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,860
Speaker 1: - Like Eclipse, I've never read it, I've been taught.

630
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,159
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there were games, well I've read the rule book for Eclipse.

631
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,458
Speaker 0: - But not the expansion one.

632
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:40,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are games where we've been getting the rules wrong the whole time.

633
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,880
Speaker 1: - Well remember the first time we played Puerto Rico.

634
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:42,820
Speaker 1: we got it way wrong.

635
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,239
Speaker 0: - Wasn't there something we got wrong in Seven Wonders this whole time that we discovered?

636
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,437
Speaker 1: - Now I'm trying to find--.

637
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,280
Speaker 0: - There was some game over the weekend where we discovered we'd always been playing it wrong.

638
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,800
Speaker 1: - Yes, but I found a copy of the rules online at least.

639
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,159
Speaker 1: that says the way we were playing, so I could do some research.

640
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,093
Speaker 1: But the biggest one was Amun-Re, which we got something wrong, we fixed it like a year later, wrongly.

641
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,020
Speaker 1: And then years after that, we were playing with someone at a con and they were like, "What the fuck?

642
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:16,176
Speaker 1: "That's not how that rule

643
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:16,379
Speaker 1: works.".

644
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,194
Speaker 1: And we all looked at each other and we're like, "What, no, no, no, we looked in the rule book, "no, no, no, we were

645
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:21,417
Speaker 1: wrong.".

646
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 1: So even the gamer-iest gamers get this shit wrong.

647
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:34,839
Speaker 0: The moral, at some point, even if you've been taught how to play a game-- - Read all the rules, not just the sections that you're shady on, read every word, even the sections you are so sure of.

648
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,040
Speaker 1: - And read it cover to cover.

649
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,140
Speaker 1: - Yeah, every word.

650
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,898
Speaker 1: - And also, if you learn a game like Small World and then someone tries to play Vinci with you, just don't.

651
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,778
Speaker 1: If games are very similar, pick one and never play the other one.

652
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,560
Speaker 1: - 'Cause I still fuck up Small World because of Vinci.

653
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,460
Speaker 0: - Yes, I have a hard time playing Small World.

654
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:54,773
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

655
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,960
Speaker 0: - All right, what else did we play--.

656
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,860
Speaker 1: - So I played this game that friends taught us correctly.

657
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:01,576
Speaker 1: I have learned which friends are trustworthy and which ones aren't.

658
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:02,999
Speaker 1: Ginkgopolis.

659
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,799
Speaker 0: - Okay.

660
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,700
Speaker 1: - It's hard to explain what's cool about this game, but it works with two players.

661
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:13,300
Speaker 1: It can be played one player, kind of like Agricola can.

662
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:17,460
Speaker 1: I'm really at a loss for how to describe this game.

663
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:25,659
Speaker 1: It's kind of like tile worker placement, but the mechanics are, it has no less than three pretty unique mechanics.

664
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,292
Speaker 1: I really can't, Scott, I bought it, I ordered it.

665
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,139
Speaker 0: - Okay.

666
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,778
Speaker 0: - 'Cause I liked it.

667
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,760
Speaker 0: - You spent all the money you want.

668
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,298
Speaker 1: - It was cheap.

669
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:41,118
Speaker 1: We have to play it and then we have to review it because it's really difficult to explain, one, I don't know if the game's good, but I enjoyed it.

670
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:47,099
Speaker 1: Two, it is very difficult without going into extreme depth to explain this game, it needs an entire show.

671
00:36:48,260 --> 00:37:02,299
Speaker 1: But even if it ends up being bad on multiple playthroughs, Ginkgopolis gets points for being way different from any board game I have ever played, yet using the concepts and mechanics of board games that I'm intimately familiar with.

672
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:06,020
Speaker 1: I like it and I can't explain it until later.

673
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,719
Speaker 0: - Did you play, we didn't play this at MAGFest, we played it at New Year's.

674
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,779
Speaker 0: Did you play Coop, C-O-U-P, Coop?

675
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,980
Speaker 1: - I watched other people play it, but I was involved in something else at the table.

676
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,540
Speaker 0: - Okay, so here's how the game works, right?

677
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,819
Speaker 0: It was a game that I've seen around a lot lately, just like I've seen Love Letter and The Resistance around a lot lately.

678
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Speaker 0: It's a similar small box game, seemed to be played by the same kinds of groups of people, like that casual board game meetup kind of game.

679
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:33,199
Speaker 0: After playing it, I can see why.

680
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,799
Speaker 0: Here's how it works, real simple game.

681
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,257
Speaker 0: There's a deck of cards, there's different roles, there's two copies of each role in the box, right?

682
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:47,599
Speaker 0: Everyone gets two face down, you look at 'em, but you don't show anyone, 'cause it's a bluffing game.

683
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,015
Speaker 0: On your turn, there's certain actions you can do, right?

684
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,480
Speaker 0: Like take monies, kill people, et cetera.

685
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,040
Speaker 0: Killing people I think costs like $7 or something.

686
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:03,880
Speaker 0: There's a limit to how much money you can have, which actually ruined the most obvious strategy that I had.

687
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,780
Speaker 1: - Oh, I have my question and you can answer it after you keep talking.

688
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,520
Speaker 1: Is it just the balloon popping game?

689
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,663
Speaker 0: - Similar.

690
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:12,890
Speaker 1: - Okay.

691
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,049
Speaker 0: - Not quite though, right?

692
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,270
Speaker 0: 'Cause it's not about voting, right?

693
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:25,310
Speaker 0: It's you basically can only pop a balloon if you get up to seven, which is hard to do, right?

694
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:32,170
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, it's like one person can, basically you have to earn a vote first, which is where the game happens, is the earning of the vote.

695
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,849
Speaker 0: Also, let's say there's certain actions you can do.

696
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,850
Speaker 0: Like you can always take one dollar, but if you want, you can try to take two dollars.

697
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,509
Speaker 0: But if someone is the Duke, they can say, uh-uh, you don't get two dollars, you get zero.

698
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,090
Speaker 0: They can cancel your action.

699
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,930
Speaker 0: Now, let's say that happens.

700
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,642
Speaker 0: Let's say it's me, Rim, and Emily, and Emily goes, "Taking two

701
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,086
Speaker 0: dollars.".

702
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:55,509
Speaker 0: And Rim says, "Uh-uh, I'm the Duke, you can't do that.

703
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:56,701
Speaker 0: "I'm gonna stop

704
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:56,823
Speaker 0: you.".

705
00:38:57,732 --> 00:39:03,767
Speaker 0: Emily can either say, "Okay," and put the two dollars back, or could say, "Fuck you, Rim, you don't have the

706
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:04,029
Speaker 0: Duke.".

707
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:08,649
Speaker 0: And if you have the Duke, you turn it over and one of Emily's characters dies.

708
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,510
Speaker 1: - All right, so it's balloon popping game with bullshit.

709
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,970
Speaker 0: - Exactly, and if you do have a Duke, I mean, if you don't have a Duke, one of your guys dies 'cause you were lying, right?

710
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:21,068
Speaker 0: So that's pretty much it.

711
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,849
Speaker 0: Whoever the last person alive wins.

712
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:40,650
Speaker 0: So I realized the game gets really kind of silly and pointless after a few people were eliminated, and pretty much a lot of who wins and loses is determined by who people decide to eliminate early, right?

713
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,910
Speaker 0: It's like if someone decides to kill one of your guys first, well, you're not gonna win now, right?

714
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,550
Speaker 1: - Now, see, this is why a lot of listeners always try, like at conventions, they don't listen to the show that often, or they haven't listened to old, old episodes.

715
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:54,660
Speaker 1: They're always like, "Oh, man, you should play "The Resistance, all these

716
00:39:54,701 --> 00:39:55,065
Speaker 1: games.".

717
00:39:55,913 --> 00:40:03,670
Speaker 1: And the reason I'm always really down on them is because they're all either just synodels or mafia, so I might as well just play synodels or mafia.

718
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,850
Speaker 0: - Yeah, well, I haven't played The Resistance.

719
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,461
Speaker 0: It's supposedly the better mafia.

720
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,730
Speaker 1: - I played it, it's better in the same way that Eucharonia is better than Glory to Rome.

721
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,869
Speaker 0: - I was afraid of that.

722
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:25,748
Speaker 1: - Like, it's different, it does interesting things, but if I'm gonna play a game that's like that anyway, I might as well, I'd rather play a pure version of that game.

723
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:29,710
Speaker 1: I'd rather just play the purely political, purely psychological mafia.

724
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,570
Speaker 0: - But yeah, if you're that kind of, you know, gamer who's not super serious.

725
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,549
Speaker 1: - I love the way you said that.

726
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,250
Speaker 1: If you're stupid, you're like stupid shit.

727
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,470
Speaker 0: - You're that kind of person that goes to NerdNYC meetup and whatever and enjoys it and loves that kind of stuff.

728
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,490
Speaker 1: - That's my new insult, Scott.

729
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,030
Speaker 1: Any time someone likes something that I don't like, I'll be like, "Well, that's a great anime.

730
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:48,703
Speaker 1: "if you're that kind of

731
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:49,029
Speaker 1: person.".

732
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,009
Speaker 0: - You're that kind of person, yeah.

733
00:40:51,354 --> 00:41:01,889
Speaker 0: Then KU is actually, you know, it's just another one of those great games for the people who like games such as Pandemic, The Resistance, Battle of Sargalactica, et cetera.

734
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:04,510
Speaker 0: If those are your kind of game, put KU on the list.

735
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,206
Speaker 0: You'll fucking love it.

736
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,090
Speaker 1: - So speaking of KU, we played at MAGFest.

737
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,929
Speaker 1: We got a bunch of our friends together who they're all like hardcore gamers like us.

738
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,909
Speaker 0: They've never played Citadels.

739
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:15,570
Speaker 1: So we busted it out and played it.

740
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,269
Speaker 0: - We didn't finish it.

741
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:20,390
Speaker 1: - I love my friends because they'd never played this game before.

742
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:26,650
Speaker 1: We taught them, we started playing, and they did the right thing and ruined the game.

743
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,250
Speaker 0: - And they immediately shuffled the hands.

744
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,590
Speaker 1: - Everyone immediately, the whole game was random.

745
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,550
Speaker 0: - Half the table was randomly choosing.

746
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,990
Speaker 1: - Everyone acted randomly.

747
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,349
Speaker 1: At one point, I arranged the cards and handed them to my left.

748
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,310
Speaker 1: And that person was looking at the cards for a while.

749
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:39,968
Speaker 1: And then they stopped and they looked at me.

750
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:44,049
Speaker 1: And then they put the cards under the table and shuffled them and put one face up.

751
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:45,310
Speaker 1: It was beautiful.

752
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,049
Speaker 0: - I actually, twice, chose non-randomly to see if that would help.

753
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,670
Speaker 1: - I acted like I was choosing randomly, but decided hoping that at least one of our friends was gonna be stupid.

754
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:57,229
Speaker 1: And it turned out no one was stupid.

755
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:00,450
Speaker 1: I was really banking on one person being stupid.

756
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:03,370
Speaker 1: A person, not a particular person, but anyone.

757
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:09,290
Speaker 1: All I needed was a person who was stupid and I could've eked out victory 'cause I basically saw citadels.

758
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:16,470
Speaker 1: But nope, the game, at one point we were like, is everyone just going to act randomly until the end?

759
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,229
Speaker 1: And they're like, yup.

760
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,270
Speaker 1: And we're like, okay, we're done.

761
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,308
Speaker 0: - I think we just had something else to do.

762
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,329
Speaker 1: - Well, we wanted to play Eclipse.

763
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:22,926
Speaker 0: - That too.

764
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,190
Speaker 1: - I played a little game, Cheaty Mages, that Adam had.

765
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,590
Speaker 0: - Oh yeah, I saw that.

766
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:28,549
Speaker 1: - It was actually really fun.

767
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:42,550
Speaker 1: So it's this little game and it's gladiatorial arena and you bust out all these gladiators and they're gonna fight like the dragon and the demon and the goblin and your mages and you bet on who you think you're gonna win and it's horse betting.

768
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,987
Speaker 1: So you bet on one guy, two guys, or three guys with lower payout if you bet on more people if one of your guys wins.

769
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,350
Speaker 0: - I would just go all in on one guy each time.

770
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,250
Speaker 1: - Yes, and then you take turns playing cards, basically cheating.

771
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,870
Speaker 0: - To get the odds of your guy winning?

772
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,629
Speaker 0: - So you'll cast spells.

773
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,529
Speaker 1: Some spells are open, like make this guy weaker, make this guy stronger.

774
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,389
Speaker 1: Some spells go face down.

775
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,230
Speaker 0: - Can you bet on the same guy someone else bet on?

776
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,750
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's secret betting.

777
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:05,902
Speaker 0: - This is obvious.

778
00:43:05,943 --> 00:43:06,329
Speaker 0: what to do.

779
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,950
Speaker 0: In the round one, I don't wanna go first, right?

780
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:11,090
Speaker 0: I want someone else to go first.

781
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,128
Speaker 1: - You don't know what people bet on.

782
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:12,815
Speaker 0: - Oh.

783
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:13,708
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

784
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,056
Speaker 1: - Oh.

785
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:14,787
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

786
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:16,670
Speaker 0: - Well then nevermind, I don't know what to do.

787
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,750
Speaker 1: - So to make matters more interesting, here's the catch.

788
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:21,430
Speaker 1: Every battle--.

789
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,190
Speaker 0: - Can I wait to see how they cheat before I bet?

790
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,989
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you bet first and then you go around betting and doing stuff until everyone passes.

791
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,870
Speaker 0: - Oh no, I wanna bet after people do stuff.

792
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,850
Speaker 1: - You get six spells, you can cast as many as you want.

793
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:37,609
Speaker 1: You draw three at the end of the turn with a hand limit of six and you do three turns.

794
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,049
Speaker 1: Like three go-arounds.

795
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:45,609
Speaker 1: The key is that every go-around, you randomly flip over a judge and the judges all have specific rules.

796
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,709
Speaker 1: Like can't cast forbidden spells, can't cast direct spells, do whatever the fuck you want.

797
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:55,069
Speaker 1: And it's just really fun and really quick and really light.

798
00:43:57,211 --> 00:43:58,629
Speaker 0: I think I played another game.

799
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,783
Speaker 1: - Jungle Speed Safari.

800
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,170
Speaker 1: you played.

801
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,250
Speaker 0: - Oh, that's the one I was forgetting.

802
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:07,930
Speaker 1: - So I watched you guys play and when you all went rah, rah, I decided that game looked stupid.

803
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,630
Speaker 0: - It is L-stupid.

804
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,710
Speaker 0: Do not play Jungle Speed Safari, just play Jungle Speed.

805
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:13,408
Speaker 0: - Yep.

806
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,047
Speaker 0: - The end.

807
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:15,510
Speaker 0: It's a baby game.

808
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,630
Speaker 1: - We played some Jungle Speed, I got cut.

809
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,210
Speaker 1: Like I got cut and bled all over the totem, it was awesome.

810
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:21,787
Speaker 1: - Chia cut me.

811
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,460
Speaker 0: - I think there's one other game we played.

812
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:27,879
Speaker 1: - Oh, we played Eclipse.

813
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,660
Speaker 1: I kind of want to talk about our game of Eclipse.

814
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,900
Speaker 0: - That's what I was suggesting.

815
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,780
Speaker 1: - All right, so before we get to Eclipse, played a lot of Glory to Rome, which Scott is down on.

816
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,100
Speaker 0: - I mean, it's not a bad game.

817
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,000
Speaker 0: It's just you guys play it so fucking much.

818
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,158
Speaker 1: - So I played it a bunch.

819
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,000
Speaker 0: - You played more games of Glory to Rome than I played of Netrunner.

820
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,399
Speaker 1: - So I played Glory to Rome a bunch of times.

821
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,420
Speaker 0: - Played so much Glory to Rome.

822
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,460
Speaker 1: - And I put a lot of thought into who was playing with me and why they wanted to play Glory to Rome over other games.

823
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,716
Speaker 1: And I figured it out.

824
00:44:56,561 --> 00:45:03,619
Speaker 1: One, because Glory to Rome is fairly straightforward rules wise, like it's actually pretty easy to teach for as complex as it looks.

825
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,739
Speaker 1: Pretty much everyone we know knows the rules, which you can't say about almost any other good game we own.

826
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,716
Speaker 1: Any game, El Grande, Puerto Rico, Teen E.

827
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:13,820
Speaker 0: - You know why?

828
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,259
Speaker 0: Because people play Glory to Rome instead of playing those games and learning them.

829
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,679
Speaker 1: - Two, the game is pretty quick.

830
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,360
Speaker 1: Like 45 minutes at most, if everyone knows what the fuck they're doing.

831
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,019
Speaker 1: And three, it is a game of skill.

832
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,959
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and four, no one we know has solved it.

833
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,159
Speaker 0: - You can get a bad draw.

834
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,359
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you can, but I've learned to mitigate that.

835
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:41,079
Speaker 1: So the novel thing is that I played a few games of the Imperium version, which I haven't really played much.

836
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:47,900
Speaker 1: And I really like the Imperium version now because in the normal game, a lot of people follow the leader often.

837
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,619
Speaker 1: In the Imperium version, like I lead a role and most of the time, most people think.

838
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:57,460
Speaker 1: Like it is way hard to do anything.

839
00:45:58,543 --> 00:46:00,660
Speaker 1: And you can't rely on luck of the draw.

840
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:04,039
Speaker 1: You've got to have a strategy and you've got to commit to that strategy.

841
00:46:05,302 --> 00:46:08,739
Speaker 1: So I'm going to play Glory to Rome only Imperium version for a little while.

842
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,920
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to probably write something up about it.

843
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,140
Speaker 0: - I'll play some Imperium version.

844
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,416
Speaker 1: - Well, we'll do it, we'll do it.

845
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,519
Speaker 0: - So we played a game of eclipse.

846
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,560
Speaker 1: - With everything.

847
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,319
Speaker 0: - With every, absolutely every expansion thing there is.

848
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:27,868
Speaker 1: - I liked everything except for the, I think alliances.

849
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:31,840
Speaker 1: just, you cannot play eclipse with the alliance mechanic if you were smart.

850
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,580
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I'm not a fan of the, I'm definitely not a fan of the alliances.

851
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,740
Speaker 0: Not only cause they make the game way, way longer, right?

852
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:42,820
Speaker 1: - We can, we now understand exactly mechanically why it makes the game take longer though.

853
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,920
Speaker 0: - So the reason it makes the game take longer, the first reason is sort of a meta reason, right?

854
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,839
Speaker 0: It's like, let's say you're playing a game, any game.

855
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:52,859
Speaker 0: And on your turn, you think of what to do and you do it.

856
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,520
Speaker 0: And you're good at, you're a fast turn taker, right?

857
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,279
Speaker 0: Doesn't, right?

858
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:56,739
Speaker 0: Any game.

859
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:04,020
Speaker 0: If you have an alliance, suddenly on your turn, you're now discussing with your teammate what to do.

860
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,200
Speaker 0: Not like bridge, we're not allowed to discuss, right?

861
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:07,200
Speaker 0: You're discussing.

862
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,620
Speaker 1: - And that happened in our game.

863
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:10,420
Speaker 1: As soon as I was in alliance with the A.

864
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:18,140
Speaker 0: - The act of talking, hearing takes way, way more time than the act of just thinking and deciding.

865
00:47:18,561 --> 00:47:26,039
Speaker 1: - I have to say things like you move your guys there so that when the gray token comes to me, I can build a unit to move it.

866
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:34,420
Speaker 0: - Every single turn, constantly talking, the two allied people took on their turns, Raymond, more time.

867
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,120
Speaker 1: - Three allied people.

868
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:35,757
Speaker 1: We had Pete too.

869
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,299
Speaker 0: - Pete wasn't really.

870
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,260
Speaker 1: - I'll get to Pete.

871
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:41,739
Speaker 1: I'm going to call Pete out for being shit at eclipse, but we'll get to that.

872
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:49,219
Speaker 0: - Anyway, you know, you just frigging took so long in your turns because you had to physically talk to other people about what you were going to do.

873
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,419
Speaker 1: - There's a secondary problem with the alliances that further exacerbates this.

874
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,020
Speaker 1: So with a lot, with I'm playing by myself.

875
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,760
Speaker 0: - This counts for any game of the alliances, but eclipse also.

876
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,738
Speaker 1: - I can use really rough heuristics to follow what's going on in sectors of space that are far away from me.

877
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:12,520
Speaker 1: And I only need to apply complex heuristics to my immediate neighbors or emergent situations that I could affect in some fashion.

878
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,760
Speaker 1: Like I ignore Scott 'cause he's behind Andrew.

879
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,119
Speaker 0: - I'm so far away.

880
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,380
Speaker 0: You can't affect me and I can't affect you.

881
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,748
Speaker 0: So don't even, you don't even need to pay attention to me on your turn.

882
00:48:21,788 --> 00:48:27,320
Speaker 0: 'cause you can't do anything about it unless maybe I'm going to buy a science off the thing, in which case you couldn't stop me anyway.

883
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,179
Speaker 1: - So let's say there's you and me and we're separated by Andrew.

884
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,280
Speaker 1: And suddenly I see you move all your ships away from Andrew.

885
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,100
Speaker 1: 'cause you're going to attack Pete.

886
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:37,180
Speaker 1: That might affect my decision.

887
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,847
Speaker 1: and now I'm going to go attack Andrew, but notice how.

888
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:41,200
Speaker 1: it's something really broad.

889
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:42,940
Speaker 1: He's moving a bunch of guys away.

890
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,520
Speaker 1: If Chie is next to me, I'll be like, she built that fighter.

891
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,760
Speaker 1: I'm going to walk over to her.

892
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,920
Speaker 0: - It has this equipment in it.

893
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,539
Speaker 1: - I'm walking over and looking at what that ship has and then calculating some odds.

894
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:57,319
Speaker 1: But as soon as I was allied with Chie, I had to look at the whole board now.

895
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,580
Speaker 1: And more importantly, I had to look at the other alliance and I couldn't just look at Scott.

896
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:03,819
Speaker 1: I had to look at Scott's ally.

897
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,296
Speaker 0: - I wasn't in an alliance.

898
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,100
Speaker 1: - All right, the other two were in the alliance.

899
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,919
Speaker 1: You were by yourself.

900
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,239
Speaker 1: So now I have to look at the other alliance and every alliance.

901
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:19,640
Speaker 1: So if there's an alliance and then two lone wolves and then I'm in alliance, I have to analyze all the other entities every turn.

902
00:49:20,243 --> 00:49:21,620
Speaker 1: I can't ignore anything.

903
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,660
Speaker 0: - You have to play for your whole team basically.

904
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
Speaker 0: Everyone on your team has to play for your whole team.

905
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,760
Speaker 1: - And every turn I have to calculate.

906
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,000
Speaker 0: - You're all the quarterback of the whole three team army.

907
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,986
Speaker 1: - And I have to calculate.

908
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:33,840
Speaker 1: not just will this get me points?

909
00:49:34,022 --> 00:49:40,260
Speaker 1: I have to calculate, does this give my team more average points than it would if I did Y or Z?

910
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,600
Speaker 0: - That's the specific thing to Eclipse that makes it even harder for the alliance.

911
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,630
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and alliance's score is the average of all the members.

912
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,420
Speaker 0: - You're calculating the average of your three guys.

913
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:54,060
Speaker 0: So it's like, well, this is the way I can get the most points but if I did this, our average score would go up more.

914
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,520
Speaker 0: So we should do that instead.

915
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,120
Speaker 0: And suddenly everything takes longer to calculate.

916
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:07,079
Speaker 1: - And luckily, while they're highly political, that is unlike Dune, mitigated heavily by the fact that you can really only ally with people you've gotten into contact with.

917
00:50:08,563 --> 00:50:11,600
Speaker 1: And interestingly, I don't think the alliances are actually political in most cases.

918
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,179
Speaker 1: Like in this game, I did not want to ally with Jie.

919
00:50:15,502 --> 00:50:26,299
Speaker 1: I was forced to because the way the board ended up, we shared a border into the galactic center and then Pete drew tiles that had a wormhole on them and Jie drew a tile that had a wormhole on it.

920
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:31,199
Speaker 1: So there's a wormhole connecting Jie and Pete and I was neighboring Jie.

921
00:50:32,183 --> 00:50:38,340
Speaker 1: We were forced into an alliance because otherwise Pete would have attacked Jie and there would have been this huge cycle of bullshit.

922
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,618
Speaker 0: - But why not have a cycle of bullshit if you can come out on top?

923
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,140
Speaker 1: - Because I didn't think I could come out on top in that situation.

924
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,919
Speaker 0: - Well, then if you don't think you could have, one of those other two people was going to.

925
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,874
Speaker 0: Is that not correct?

926
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:51,219
Speaker 0: - Ah, but.

927
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,660
Speaker 0: - So why did that person choose to ally and not just attack?

928
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:03,998
Speaker 1: - So Pete allied because he planned from the beginning to break the alliance and fuck us and the only way to get us to stay away from the wormhole was to be in an alliance with us.

929
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,360
Speaker 0: - Oh, so he wanted to ally to get you to move a certain way and then break it so they get lost.

930
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,979
Speaker 1: - So on the last turn, he's like, I betray you.

931
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,100
Speaker 0: - But you can't break an alliance on the last turn.

932
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:19,159
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so now we had to play the last turn with an ally who tried and could not betray us, who is still in our alliance, we couldn't kick him out.

933
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,619
Speaker 0: - Right.

934
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,759
Speaker 1: - Also, he derped around and kind of just fucked up.

935
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,519
Speaker 0: - Well, you allied with someone just because they were touching you.

936
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,480
Speaker 1: - We had to because we had no way to defend ourselves otherwise.

937
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,500
Speaker 0: - Why don't you defend yourself?

938
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,300
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so the alliances ruin Eclipse.

939
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,799
Speaker 1: Do never play with alliances.

940
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:41,900
Speaker 0: - Right, another thing is that there's all the extra stuff in the Eclipse that isn't alliances in the expansion.

941
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,060
Speaker 0: It just gives you more stuff.

942
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,720
Speaker 0: - I disagree.

943
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,660
Speaker 0: - It's not good, it's not bad, but I don't think it really makes a difference.

944
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,420
Speaker 1: It just makes more calculations.

945
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,779
Speaker 1: - Basic Eclipse is super boring.

946
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,240
Speaker 0: - It's not super boring.

947
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,200
Speaker 1: - I think it's super boring.

948
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,240
Speaker 0: - It's not mechanically different.

949
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,120
Speaker 0: You don't make different decisions, it just takes you more time to calculate.

950
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,140
Speaker 1: - No, the galactic center falls basically immediately.

951
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,319
Speaker 1: It's just a race to the center and a race to research and aliens are just victory points.

952
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:16,159
Speaker 1: At least with the strong aliens, it forces you to have a cycle of development and you have to plan between attacking aliens and attacking people.

953
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,180
Speaker 0: - Nah, the aliens aren't that much harder.

954
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,959
Speaker 0: The regular aliens are still on the board.

955
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,660
Speaker 0: The galactic center, I was gonna take it out if you didn't interfere.

956
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,939
Speaker 1: - Your ship sucked ass.

957
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:26,819
Speaker 0: - My ships are great.

958
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,240
Speaker 1: - Yeah, how come I destroyed your fleet with almost no damage to mine?

959
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,878
Speaker 0: - Because I built galactic center fighting ships, not rim fighting ships.

960
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:43,820
Speaker 1: - Scott, I said out loud because we're in that alliance, every turn for multiple turns, if Scott attacks the galactic center, I'm sending my glass cannons in to fuck him.

961
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,800
Speaker 0: - Yeah, which is why I thought you weren't gonna do it.

962
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Speaker 0: And you also, on the very turn that you did it, you were ho-humming and not so committing to it and I was like, he's not gonna do it.

963
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,840
Speaker 0: - Well, because I could have glass cannon fell.

964
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:55,940
Speaker 0: - That's what I was saying.

965
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,080
Speaker 0: I'm like, he's not gonna do it.

966
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,140
Speaker 0: He's gonna go the other way.

967
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,760
Speaker 1: - Yeah, and then I looked at your ships and your ships were bullshit.

968
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:02,038
Speaker 1: So I attacked you.

969
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,140
Speaker 0: - My ships were great against the galactic center.

970
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,580
Speaker 1: - So were mine.

971
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,780
Speaker 0: - Also, I got fucked by the god of dice.

972
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,359
Speaker 0: But Alia acted.

973
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,700
Speaker 1: - That's your fault for leaning on the table.

974
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,360
Speaker 0: - Scott Johnson led on the table, not Scott Rubin.

975
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,320
Speaker 1: - I'll put it this way.

976
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:23,260
Speaker 1: We can debate about the other parts, like Scott and I don't agree 100%, but we agree, do not use alliances in Eclipse.

977
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:26,960
Speaker 1: But the parallel turn play actually is pretty great.

978
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,980
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that was the thing I was actually the most skeptical about was the simultaneous turns.

979
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,660
Speaker 1: - You were like, no, you were really mad about it before we played.

980
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,220
Speaker 0: - But it ended up not, and in fact, the only times it mattered, no one else seemed to notice.

981
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:49,419
Speaker 0: There were three times where I held on to the guy and someone else could have forced me to take my turn before they took their turn.

982
00:53:49,762 --> 00:53:54,757
Speaker 0: But I really, really, really wanted them to take their turn first so I could see what they were gonna do.

983
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:56,840
Speaker 0: And they didn't even notice.

984
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,579
Speaker 0: They just took their turn and passed the thing, and then I took my turn and passed the thing and wiped the sweat off my brow.

985
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,652
Speaker 1: And I'm like, all right, if you're just gonna let me do that.

986
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,660
Speaker 1: - Look at the elegance of the mechanic.

987
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,840
Speaker 1: You don't have to make it an issue unless both people care.

988
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,820
Speaker 0: - But they were stupid not to care.

989
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,360
Speaker 0: Were they not paying attention?

990
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,959
Speaker 1: - Maybe they had other concerns.

991
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,038
Speaker 0: - They must have.

992
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,219
Speaker 0: - So I basically got my way three times.

993
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:31,300
Speaker 0: But if I had been playing with a bunch of Scott Rubins, maybe the simultaneous turn mechanic would not have been so pleasant.

994
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,120
Speaker 0: It's possible.

995
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,460
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was still, in the real experience, it was much better than I anticipated.

996
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,500
Speaker 1: - What game did I play?

997
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,799
Speaker 0: - Would play again with simultaneous turns.

998
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,860
Speaker 1: - I played this game.

999
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,820
Speaker 1: It was at Skelter's party.

1000
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,600
Speaker 1: I don't remember which game.

1001
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:47,700
Speaker 1: Oh, right, it was Homesteaders, where it had that mechanic where basically, everyone does something simultaneously.

1002
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:51,700
Speaker 1: So we start playing, and I immediately just said, "I'm not taking my action.

1003
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,754
Speaker 1: "till everyone else is taking their

1004
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:53,017
Speaker 1: action.".

1005
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:00,976
Speaker 1: And the guy who talks to the game sighs, pulls out the book and quotes a thing that basically says, "If any player makes an issue of this, "then play proceeds in this

1006
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:01,239
Speaker 1: way.".

1007
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:02,997
Speaker 1: And he was like, "You're that guy,

1008
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:03,180
Speaker 1: Rim.".

1009
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:03,528
Speaker 1: And I was like,

1010
00:55:03,548 --> 00:55:03,732
Speaker 1: "Yep.".

1011
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,317
Speaker 0: - Yep.

1012
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,359
Speaker 1: - You know what, I really wanna play Eclipse.

1013
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,459
Speaker 0: - All right, let's play it.

1014
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:08,976
Speaker 0: - Like right now.

1015
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:09,540
Speaker 0: - All right.

1016
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,960
Speaker 1: - Maybe we should play some two player.

1017
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,940
Speaker 0: - All right.

1018
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,819
Speaker 1: - See how that goes.

1019
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,480
Speaker 1: That might be interesting.

1020
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,760
Speaker 1: - Maybe I'll come over this weekend.

1021
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,058
Speaker 1: Wanna play Eclipse over footballs?

1022
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,320
Speaker 0: - Buy, oh we don't have a table in my house.

1023
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,280
Speaker 1: - On the floor.

1024
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:23,859
Speaker 0: - And we don't have an expansion.

1025
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,140
Speaker 1: - Kitchen floor, no expansion.

1026
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,920
Speaker 0: - Buy me the expansion.

1027
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,959
Speaker 1: - I thought you hated the expansion.

1028
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,020
Speaker 0: - I thought you wanted the expansion so badly.

1029
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,879
Speaker 1: - I could play without 'em, I just really like 'em.

1030
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,396
Speaker 1: - All right.

1031
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,078
Speaker 1: - Maybe there's laughing.

1032
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:36,519
Speaker 1: All right, Magfest was fucking awesome and I think we're done.

1033
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,518
Speaker 1: Any more games, is that it?

1034
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,520
Speaker 0: - I'm sure there might have been, but I wanna go home and eat, I'm hungry.

1035
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,659
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I'm also super hungry.

1036
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:44,759
Speaker 1: So yeah, we're back in town, guys.
