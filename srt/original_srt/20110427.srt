Speaker 0: There's a capital C.

27
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:50,418
Speaker 1: I would just like to point out that I do drink quite a bit But by all measures by scientific measures of how much I drink I'm on the low end of moderate drinking.

28
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:53,409
Speaker 1: you have to drink A fuck ton of alcohol to be considered.

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,020
Speaker 0: That's like saying I don't do crack.

30
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,586
Speaker 0: I only do crack once a week.

31
00:01:57,626 --> 00:02:00,980
Speaker 1: that other guy does crack every day, but I didn't say I don't do alcohol.

32
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:02,706
Speaker 1: I do alcohol in quantity.

33
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:06,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just saying you may not be technically an alcoholic.

34
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,407
Speaker 1: I'm not even a moderate drinker.

35
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:12,698
Speaker 0: Yes, but your liver is still damaged.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,624
Speaker 1: actually no It's not.

37
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:15,340
Speaker 0: you realize you want to have a liver battle.

38
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:17,288
Speaker 1: I think my liver could win.

39
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:20,060
Speaker 0: my liver is probably gonna kick your liver's ass.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,669
Speaker 1: Got you to realize that the liver is not damaged.

41
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:32,160
Speaker 1: if alcohol consumption is lower than the rate of alcohol Processing it's only when you consume too much in a short period or consume large amounts chronically.

42
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:45,036
Speaker 1: Do stupid things like taking a bunch of Tylenol so Discussed or take it's got a bunch of Tylenol is not one like Tylenol p.m.. One night.

43
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:46,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's more than me.

44
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:51,785
Speaker 0: Okay, there's probably some cells in your liver that are damaged And you know how many of my liver damage?

45
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,528
Speaker 1: zero you know what?

46
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:56,992
Speaker 1: probably not and also we'll see who makes it to 90 You kidding.

47
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:57,619
Speaker 0: I'm making it to.

48
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:02,640
Speaker 1: But yeah, we were at anime Boston.

49
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:09,602
Speaker 1: We're not gonna really Extra liver cells gonna carry me the whole way cuz we've been to many anime Boston's where we got to see Clarissa and Gerald and Darryl.

50
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:14,163
Speaker 1: briefly Scott saw them slightly more than I did because he went to Jikoku.

51
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:23,300
Speaker 1: yep, I did not because I had to run a panel and while I went to Scott's hot steamy coup panel Which I had nothing to do with I even sat on stage doing nothing the whole time.

52
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:27,180
Speaker 0: So good of you to sit on stage and do nothing and be in the way.

53
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,860
Speaker 1: I was there for the introduction, and then I just sat there one five one point.

54
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,239
Speaker 1: I even gave up and just put my microphone down as watched.

55
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:39,200
Speaker 1: Well, uh yeah Scott went to anime hell while I had to run my anime openers panel all by myself.

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I was you know showing an example and obeying the golden rule.

57
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:55,040
Speaker 0: Golden rule yeah the real golden rule Yeah, no I Didn't want you to sit on stage and annoy me so I did not sit on stage.

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,360
Speaker 1: And you know you think is you would had fun annoying people in my panel.

59
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:04,017
Speaker 1: Even though I had to cut it short I barely finished because we had to cut all the panels down to like 45 minutes.

60
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:05,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you know.

61
00:04:05,926 --> 00:04:07,976
Speaker 0: if they don't want to put they do.

62
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:08,880
Speaker 0: I understand.

63
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,540
Speaker 0: It's like there was some bad discussion of whether they would put gaps in the panels, and they decided not to write.

64
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,237
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

65
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:19,620
Speaker 0: So let's say you got it you got a convention you're scheduling and you decide we're not gonna put gaps.

66
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:24,200
Speaker 0: So we'll make all the panels one hour, and we'll put them right up next up against each other, okay?

67
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:32,580
Speaker 0: So that means that the panel gets an hour And then you have to switch rooms and the next panel gets an hour right and everyone has to switch rooms basically instantly.

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,254
Speaker 0: But what they did is they basically stopped all the panels 45 15 minutes early.

69
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,544
Speaker 0: so the panels are only actually 45 minutes long.

70
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:46,280
Speaker 0: so why didn't they just schedule on the schedule the panels to be 45 minutes long and put 15 minute gaps there?

71
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:50,435
Speaker 0: At least then I would have known my panel was you know 45 minutes instead of.

72
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:53,409
Speaker 0: I had an hour panel And I tried to use my whole hour.

73
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,796
Speaker 0: It was cut short.

74
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:55,863
Speaker 1: well We'll see.

75
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:59,945
Speaker 1: I mean Lou is probably of all the anime cons We work with other than the professional.

76
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,414
Speaker 0: he told me that he wanted gaps, and he was shot down.

77
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:06,990
Speaker 1: well the smartest and most Competent of all anime con panel schedulers.

78
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,339
Speaker 1: I trust Lou and I know that he always tries to do the right thing.

79
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,485
Speaker 1: yeah But otherwise it went well.

80
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:13,251
Speaker 1: I mean I'm a boss.

81
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:14,274
Speaker 0: I got no other.

82
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:16,060
Speaker 1: no other complaint was another anime Boston.

83
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:16,980
Speaker 1: I have one complaint.

84
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:21,200
Speaker 1: Boston apparently can't handle any number of people with cell phones.

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,314
Speaker 1: I don't know what was up this weekend, but literally like my cell phone Just kept not getting signal.

86
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:27,000
Speaker 0: I had no problem.

87
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:30,080
Speaker 1: Ah, but a lot of people are having problems mostly sprinting Verizon people.

88
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,327
Speaker 0: Uh I had the wait.

89
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,560
Speaker 0: wait I had the evil AT&T and it worked just fine.

90
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,336
Speaker 1: You were complaining on Saturday at like five or six junctures about how you didn't have enough signal.

91
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:39,360
Speaker 1: the stuff was loading slowly.

92
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:44,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was trying to watch an HD movie on YouTube, and it was loading slowly on a cell phone.

93
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,305
Speaker 0: Gee there's a surprise.

94
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:46,646
Speaker 0: Well.

95
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,714
Speaker 0: I think what hand at the top of a hotel.

96
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:54,614
Speaker 1: I think what was happening is that one Boston doesn't have a lot of tall buildings not to disparage Boston.

97
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,159
Speaker 1: It is one of the only cities I've ever spent any time.

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,712
Speaker 0: It's an okay city, but they're tall.

99
00:05:58,753 --> 00:05:59,660
Speaker 0: buildings are not high.

100
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:00,984
Speaker 1: Consider living in like.

101
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:04,957
Speaker 1: if I couldn't live in New York for whatever reason I think I could deal with Boston.

102
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,740
Speaker 1: Boston is pretty chill Even though their subway doesn't run all the time and consist of tiny buses.

103
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,627
Speaker 1: but I Got about two stories up.

104
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,644
Speaker 1: suddenly cell service starts dropping off Rapidly.

105
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:22,540
Speaker 0: yeah, they didn't have a lot of tall buildings.

106
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,477
Speaker 1: So we're on the twister for Scott to take his laptop downstairs Load my little pony and then come all the way back up to the 21st floor to watch it.

107
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,519
Speaker 0: yep But you know whatever it worked.

108
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:38,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my biggest complaint about anime Boston was that Boston cell service for sprinting Verizon sucks.

109
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:39,304
Speaker 1: Pretty good con.

110
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:43,620
Speaker 1: all right spend most of our time in the gaming area with our awesome.

111
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,930
Speaker 1: None of our like local posse went.

112
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,080
Speaker 1: we had none of the like core front row crew.

113
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,522
Speaker 1: It was.

114
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,065
Speaker 0: they went to.

115
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,838
Speaker 0: they went to PAX and yeah, they don't go to every con like we do.

116
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,240
Speaker 1: yep.

117
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,408
Speaker 1: So it was all like fans and formites, and it was pretty rockin time shoutouts to everyone We played games with.

118
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:03,119
Speaker 1: for also We've got two people are gonna help us do that show on wrestling that we keep saying we're gonna do.

119
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:11,243
Speaker 1: Okay, I learned a lot about wrestling talking to the hit man Right.

120
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,186
Speaker 0: so check this out.

121
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,835
Speaker 0: you know IDW the comic publisher.

122
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:18,569
Speaker 0: yeah most of the comics They put out are the licensed properties.

123
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:18,911
Speaker 0: remember.

124
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:27,222
Speaker 0: They were doing that that invasion thing that was Star Trek and transformers and Ghostbusters and right oh Yeah.

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:42,518
Speaker 0: Well apparently they put out a comic called it GI Joe a real American hero and basically what that was You know because they basically they put out so many different GI Joe and transformers comics that are all over the place right.

126
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:49,000
Speaker 0: some of Them are standalone like there was the steampunk one that I read and there was that all hell Megatron one.

127
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,983
Speaker 0: It was like standalone.

128
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:52,452
Speaker 0: things have nothing to do anything else, and then they got like.

129
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,817
Speaker 0: they got like freaking.

130
00:07:54,198 --> 00:08:02,655
Speaker 0: you know Generation this and you know bad guy perspective that and then good Cyberstron this thing and it's all is like so many different things.

131
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:04,983
Speaker 0: you can't figure out how they go together Which one you want to read.

132
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:16,972
Speaker 0: right, but apparently this one comic they have called GI Joe a real American hero, and it picks up Exactly where the original GI Joe comics from Marvel left off.

133
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,158
Speaker 1: well like the original original right.

134
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:24,500
Speaker 0: so the Marvel GI Joe comics from the 80s right ended so that I read a whole bunch of those.

135
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,159
Speaker 0: So the first issue of GI Joe a real American hero picks up exactly where that last issue left off.

136
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:35,443
Speaker 0: There's a fan petition right To IDW.

00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:05,554
Speaker 0: there were 80 issues of that comic right And that's pretty much like the core of Transformers.

146
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,060

Speaker 0: number one is basically issue number 81.

150
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,171
Speaker 1: So I don't think this will happen.

151
00:09:18,673 --> 00:09:19,035
Speaker 0: why not?

152
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:20,200
Speaker 0: they made a GI Joe one.

153
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,008
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't they make a part of this?

154
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 1: because GI Joe the reboot you know the movie and every like GI Joe does not have the cachet in the industry right now that transformers does with all its movies and whatever The Transformers franchise I think if anything is gonna be closer and more based on the current live-action movies than I know

155
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,463
Speaker 0: There's only one.

156
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:39,770
Speaker 0: there's only one comic series.

157
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,976
Speaker 0: That's based on the movies all the.

158
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:43,411
Speaker 0: there's a whole bunch of them And only one of them has any to do with the movies.

159
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:44,800
Speaker 1: yeah, I know, but I'm saying going forward.

160
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,146
Speaker 1: I mean what were the sales and all those?

161
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:49,179
Speaker 1: I think they're more interested in driving the movie.

162
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:52,294
Speaker 0: friend I think you're thinking too hard about it because basically this is comics.

163
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:53,420
Speaker 0: No one gives a shit about comics.

164
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,226
Speaker 0: They do whatever they want.

165
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,859
Speaker 0: they've been making all sorts of weird guys.

166
00:09:57,585 --> 00:10:10,580
Speaker 1: But at the same time when push comes to shove when someone says make a comic on something in anywhere in the toy industry The person saying that is usually thinking I have a movie and or some other property that I need to push.

167
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:13,878
Speaker 1: The comic is a trivial and cheap way to push that on.

168
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:14,240
Speaker 1: to nurse.

169
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,840
Speaker 0: Oh, but see that you see you're thinking about something like Hasbro right where Hasbro controls for example my little pony, right?

170
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:22,476
Speaker 1: Hasbro stop cocking up don't?

171
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:22,758
Speaker 1: don't?

172
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:27,236
Speaker 0: Anyway, and Hasbro also makes the My Little Pony toys right.

173
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:34,980
Speaker 0: Hasbro controls Transformers television movies and toys true, but the comics right.

174
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,227
Speaker 0: Transformers licensed to IDW.

175
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:48,307
Speaker 0: so basically they say IDW make the Transformers comics here you go You pay us money, and you can make Transformers comics with certain you know Restrictions or whatever.

176
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:50,740
Speaker 0: I don't know what they are because it's not like a public you know contract.

177
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,345
Speaker 0: So IDW you know.

178
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:57,639
Speaker 0: they make things like you know all hell Megatron and all sorts of whatever.

179
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:57,840
Speaker 1: all right.

180
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,160
Speaker 1: Here's my other my other rationale.

181
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:00,659
Speaker 0: They have been for a long time.

182
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,490
Speaker 0: They won't make it cuz and I don't think Hasbro even gives a shit cuz.

183
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:03,932
Speaker 0: it's comics.

184
00:11:03,952 --> 00:11:04,353
Speaker 0: who cares?

185
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:10,826
Speaker 1: twelve hundred sales times Five bucks even isn't enough money No, but that's the thing they make.

186
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,253
Speaker 0: all sorts of other failing ones.

187
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:13,278
Speaker 0: Why not make this one?

188
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,093
Speaker 1: well How many failing ones can they make?

189
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:15,820
Speaker 1: I mean how do they make money?

190
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,085
Speaker 0: I think there's actually like five or six different Transformers series concurrently.

191
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:21,529
Speaker 0: I mean there's a lot of.

192
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,758
Speaker 1: here's the question do they make money and if so on what?

193
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:25,560
Speaker 0: I don't know.

194
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:26,757
Speaker 1: That's what I'd like to know.

195
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,205
Speaker 0: Comics I don't know.

196
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:30,731
Speaker 1: I can't even tell anymore.

197
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:32,940
Speaker 1: It's even work like at least with the anime industry.

198
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,924
Speaker 1: There's the excuse of.

199
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:37,320
Speaker 1: there is no industry in the US anymore like what happened to this franchise?

200
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:39,509
Speaker 1: Oh, no one owns it, but with comics.

201
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,040
Speaker 1: We know who owns it, and we still don't know any information.

202
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

203
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:51,069
Speaker 1: so this isn't really news, but for anyone who's a fan of anime at all you should at least Be aware of the fact that Osamu Dezaki died.

204
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,700
Speaker 1: He is one of the important great legends of anime.

205
00:11:55,041 --> 00:12:00,860
Speaker 1: He sadly died due to lung cancer probably because he was a chain smoker like a lot of Japanese people.

206
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:03,612
Speaker 0: It's actually one thing that makes me like not want to go to Japan.

207
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:05,420
Speaker 0: is that I know this basically smoking everywhere.

208
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:14,700
Speaker 1: Everyone I've ever talked to who's been to Japan said yeah You're gonna hate the fact that every jackass everywhere is smoking all the time on the site in the restaurants and this everywhere.

209
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:19,987
Speaker 1: I mean when I go down south and a restaurant is like smoking or not I'm like what and I'll.

210
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,156
Speaker 0: but at least there's a non right in Japan.

211
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:23,180
Speaker 0: is there even a non?

212
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,164
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

213
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,799
Speaker 0: like is is there a such thing as a non smoking hotel room in Japan?

214
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,077
Speaker 1: now I could say a lot about Osamu Dezaki, but are people smoking in like the the?

215
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:36,636
Speaker 0: you know the Hot pond Springs, but I don't think they are there.

216
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:43,119
Speaker 1: the reason I'm not going to say a lot about Osamu Dezaki is that Mike tool said pretty much everything that needs to be said.

217
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:49,005
Speaker 1: so this is kind of a dual news because one if you don't know who this man is you Probably should.

218
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:59,289
Speaker 1: if you if you look at the list of anime he's done, and you don't recognize any of them You should watch several of them Particularly the Hajime no Ippo or Rosa Versailles.

219
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:02,219
Speaker 1: I haven't even watched Hajime no Ippo, and I know I should.

220
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:07,134
Speaker 1: yeah But you should not watch all of no just like how you don't read ambassador magma.

221
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:07,856
Speaker 1: You know of it.

222
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:08,799
Speaker 0: Why not read it?

223
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:09,180
Speaker 0: why not?

224
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,671
Speaker 1: Well you know what you read have you buddy, what is?

225
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:14,780
Speaker 0: you even know what ambassador magma is about and you know.

226
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,519
Speaker 1: Here's what I know about ambassador magma.

227
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:24,860
Speaker 1: I've been told by everyone that it is some of the worst that Osamu Dezaki has ever done.

228
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:26,646
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so that's you just so.

229
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,895
Speaker 0: basically you got in here say yeah, you have no idea.

230
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,280
Speaker 1: tell you what let's read.

231
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:31,687
Speaker 1: That'll be my next book club book.

232
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,194
Speaker 0: Where are you gonna get it in English?

233
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,127
Speaker 1: I'll get it all right I'll get it somehow.

234
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,579
Speaker 1: We'll read it in Japanese.

235
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:43,860
Speaker 1: It'll take a hundred years yeah, but seriously You know how we talk about the stereotypes of anime.

236
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,476
Speaker 1: We've done whole panels on this stuff.

237
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:59,220
Speaker 1: like Astro Boy Tezuka pioneered these certain kinds of ways of framing things and reusing footage to make anime happen and then later even when they were not Necessary anymore because the anime had bigger budgets they still did those things because they became iconic of anime.

238
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:07,200
Speaker 1: Dezaki is about as responsible for many of the tropes of anime today as Tezuka the two Osamu's I mean.

239
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:20,619
Speaker 1: I think the biggest hallmark of Dezaki is the sudden freeze-frame to a watercolor or kind of like Washed-out vision of what just happened like a highly detailed painting of the scene you just saw.

240
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:26,080
Speaker 1: Or the zoom up zoom up then zoom up a little bit slower on the same frame of animation.

241
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:29,013
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

242
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:34,760
Speaker 1: and also You know you should really read Mike Tool's articles on the Mike Tool show on anime news network.

243
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:43,064
Speaker 1: They're actually really informative and really really well written, and if you can't get to a con and see Mike Tool do his Awesome panels.

244
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:48,740
Speaker 1: the only one I got to see at Anime Boston was a true story of Oda Nobunaga as told through anime.

245
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:49,485
Speaker 0: That was a good panel.

246
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:50,330
Speaker 1: That was a great panel.

247
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,659
Speaker 0: I liked all those different.

248
00:14:53,681 --> 00:15:01,050
Speaker 0: Oda Nobunaga was a demon, but he was also a space robot and also has a mustache Yeah, but also does not have a man.

249
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,691
Speaker 1: sometimes always does is different Yeah, but he was a demon and we know that's true isn't he?

250
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:07,775
Speaker 0: woman also.

251
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:08,197
Speaker 1: Yes.

252
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:15,485
Speaker 1: He was a woman Not to be confused with Oda Nobunaga, but I digress mm-hmm.

253
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:16,730
Speaker 0: He's very ambitious.

254
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,627
Speaker 1: So things of the day I try to avoid doing you know the same old college humors every day because the secret would be if You want to see?

255
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:36,030
Speaker 1: Most of the worthwhile videos on the internet that aren't my little pony related.

256
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:42,041
Speaker 1: Pretty much college humor is gonna have them all within a few days So I really don't need to use those as things of the day.

257
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,186
Speaker 1: I assume you'll see them all.

258
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:59,144
Speaker 1: so instead I have for you from this pretty cool forum that is all about special effects like makeup masks creatures and all that kind of thing a silicone model of Bert a realistic Bert says me street Bert.

259
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,629
Speaker 0: It's horrifying.

260
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just it's.

261
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:04,790
Speaker 0: that's pretty accurate.

262
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,908
Speaker 1: It's not even in the valley like it like you could conceive of a human who looked like this.

263
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:13,197
Speaker 1: It's just Really really detailed.

264
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,930
Speaker 1: and yeah, this is the stuff of nightmares.

265
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,694
Speaker 1: Yep, that's all I got.

266
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:18,056
Speaker 1: It's pretty.

267
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:18,698
Speaker 1: I thought it was cool.

268
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,050
Speaker 0: I got something I saw at anime hell.

269
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,750
Speaker 0: This is this is direct direct from hell, right?

270
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:34,262
Speaker 0: This is a clip from the 1970s television show Ding-dong roar where they sing a drug a song about not doing drugs.

271
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:35,365
Speaker 1: kids drugs are bad kids.

272
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:36,768
Speaker 1: That's actually in the orphanage.

273
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:40,519
Speaker 1: Yep Not gonna reveal what the real deal is.

274
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,045
Speaker 0: you're gonna know as soon as you click on.

275
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:43,951
Speaker 0: the link is in the title of the YouTube video.

276
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:49,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't notice you'll know when that shit comes in before you throw it.

277
00:16:49,099 --> 00:17:09,404
Speaker 0: Oh Prime in Seattle doing probably three panel special notice There was a tweet today from official pack saying that at the current rate Pax prime will sell out of badges in 15 days.

278
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,270
Speaker 1: So buy your goddamn badges.

279
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:12,093
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

280
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:22,300
Speaker 0: if you didn't listen to us before we said that you needed to buy the badge and get the hotel room Immediately I point out it's selling out faster Maybe because we're telling everyone to buy their badges.

281
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,199
Speaker 0: if people are listening to us and taking our advice good If you're not you're gonna be screwed.

282
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:28,841
Speaker 1: Yep.

283
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,148
Speaker 1: Remember packs badges always sell out.

284
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:34,626
Speaker 1: point the first They are legally transferable.

285
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:37,278
Speaker 1: point the second In fact, that is condoned.

286
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,970
Speaker 0: point the third as long as you don't charge more than what you paid for.

287
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:46,537
Speaker 1: Yeah and even then if you do you can get away with that unless you're gonna be a Gigantic scalper jackass about it.

288
00:17:46,637 --> 00:17:50,030
Speaker 1: If you do Robert cool probably finds you and trick you like he did that one year.

289
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:58,601
Speaker 1: Yes, so anyway the moral of this is even if you can't go to packs You should buy a badge anyway on the off chance that you do.

290
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:07,187
Speaker 1: and if you can't go and you're it's a week away I guarantee you'll be able to sell that badge for exactly what you paid for it and everything will work out.

291
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:08,190
Speaker 1: buying it.

292
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:13,386
Speaker 1: You're basically putting $60 or whatever aside to have the chance to go to packs.

293
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:18,203
Speaker 1: if it all works out Mm-hmm, and even if you don't get a good hotel, you can get a shitty hotel.

294
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,970
Speaker 1: There's plenty of shitty hotels still.

295
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:21,649
Speaker 0: Yep, they're just far away.

296
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:23,317
Speaker 1: But yeah, we'll be there.

297
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,510
Speaker 1: also packs dev was announced.

298
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:40,620
Speaker 1: So if you are a game developer or in any way involved in the game industry unless your press You should check out packs dev because it's kind of like if you can afford to spend a couple more days in Seattle if you Actually work for a game company.

299
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,710
Speaker 1: There's a good chance your company will pay for you to go.

300
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,350
Speaker 1: This is basically the deal with packs dev for people who haven't been paying attention.

301
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:46,852
Speaker 0: They want.

302
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:50,507
Speaker 0: they want to make a GDC that doesn't have press so it's basically by developers.

303
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:55,370
Speaker 1: for developers Yeah, the rules are basically if you register you do not talk about what happens at packs dev.

304
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:56,010
Speaker 1: You do not tweet.

305
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:01,370
Speaker 1: I mean happens at packs dev unless the speakers or the people you're talking to give you express permission.

306
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:05,150
Speaker 1: And if you don't it is not public what they will do to you if you violate this rule.

307
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,129
Speaker 1: But my guess is they will ban you from packs dev for life.

308
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,611
Speaker 0: Yeah which?

309
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:10,514
Speaker 1: imagine this?

310
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:19,850
Speaker 1: a world with no press game designers and people in the game industry in Basically a safe place for two days to go to panels that are inside baseball.

311
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:25,208
Speaker 1: Imagine someone who works for say Blizzard doing inside baseball panel on World of Warcraft.

312
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,317
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know if that is what'll happen.

313
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,462
Speaker 0: Who knows can't say.

314
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:30,150
Speaker 0: I think that's what they hope will happen, right?

315
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,391
Speaker 0: Is it?

316
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:37,420
Speaker 0: developers will say all kinds of things that they wouldn't normally say because they don't want those things ending up in blogs and You know and stuff like that.

317
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:38,930
Speaker 1: now we may be there.

318
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:39,312
Speaker 1: We don't.

319
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:42,050
Speaker 1: we can't say anything about that yet, but there is a clause.

320
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:45,684
Speaker 1: There are people who are press but also have other hats.

321
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:51,870
Speaker 0: in the gaming industry for example Let's say you write game reviews, but you also make games like, you know penny arcade.

322
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,950
Speaker 0: They theoretically make games the least they did and they're also sort of press, right?

323
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:05,855
Speaker 1: They comment on the industry with their comics or for example say you are press like geek nights But at the same time you're doing a lecture on say game theory They have.

324
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:06,960
Speaker 0: and what if we make a game?

325
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:08,930
Speaker 1: Well, then we're doubly triple threat.

326
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:15,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the rule is if you have a press hat better take that fucker off before you come into PAX dev.

327
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:15,873
Speaker 0: That's right.

328
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:17,842
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you know, you're in trouble.

329
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:19,911
Speaker 1: same as we said before of course You know.

330
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:30,690
Speaker 0: if they they accept us and allow us to speak at PAX dev or some such, you know, which we don't know We would definitely allow people to spread the news about whatever we have to say.

331
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,193
Speaker 0: However,

332
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:47,990
Speaker 1: what I think we should do if we have time to take questions Like if we do a hardcore say a game theory panel and then we take questions I would actually want the questions to not be public because I would like people to be able to ask The inside baseball questions like we're making X game and here is our balance problem.

333
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,463
Speaker 0: That is fine with me because if it is not public that means that I can be a total jerk when I answer Yeah, I'll just get no one.

334
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:57,596
Speaker 0: I'll be like You don't know how to make games.

335
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,896
Speaker 0: That was a dumb question.

336
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:03,662
Speaker 0: You're stupid for even having asked it.

337
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:04,706
Speaker 0: We are all dumber.

338
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:07,520
Speaker 0: for me being in the room I award you no points.

339
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got have mercy on your soul That's right.

340
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:14,067
Speaker 1: You realize I memorized that Adam Sandler speech for the day when we ever take questions again.

341
00:21:14,528 --> 00:21:19,730
Speaker 1: All right Anyway, the book club book is Asimov's foundation, which you should have read.

342
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:22,569
Speaker 1: I have not read it because I'm a dumbass.

343
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:27,165
Speaker 1: I read part of it a lot halfway through it because I just finished the white luck warrior.

344
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:31,297
Speaker 1: I'll read it pretty soon And we're gonna be baby at Otacon.

345
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:32,762
Speaker 1: Like I said, we submitted our panels.

346
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:33,384
Speaker 1: if they accept them.

347
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:35,592
Speaker 1: We'll go and Let's see.

348
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:38,444
Speaker 1: There's not much else on our plate, you know board game nights all the usual stuff.

349
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:38,806
Speaker 1: We're going.

350
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:42,180
Speaker 0: bar camp NYC is open for registration.

351
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:44,917

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:03,413
Speaker 1: Yep, also kinetic on which is an anime gaming slash steampunk slash furry slash art slash voice Fucking everything.

357
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,558
Speaker 1: convention everything geeky in Hartford, Connecticut.

358
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:10,109
Speaker 1: now if we count the way packs counts, it's like a 20,000 person convention.

359
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:15,190
Speaker 1: You know, it's about 7,000 people by unique bodies and it's in Hartford, Connecticut.

360
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:22,826
Speaker 1: we are the co-directors of panels and workshops for this convention for the last couple of years and It's actually a pretty goddamn rocking convention.

361
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:23,530
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

362
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,152
Speaker 0: It's got better.

363
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:30,477
Speaker 0: tape has a better tabletop gaming situation than anything even been any gaming con I have ever been to.

364
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:40,770
Speaker 0: with the possible exception of packs I think it's actually better than packs because the library is more expansive There's more tables available per person and they are better tables.

365
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:42,476
Speaker 0: That's the only reasons.

366
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:45,748
Speaker 0: the only thing packs cuz I mean it's not like how much can you make a tabletop better?

367
00:22:45,768 --> 00:22:46,948
Speaker 0: you have games You have tables.

368
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:49,518
Speaker 0: Well, well packs has the same thing.

369
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:52,130
Speaker 0: two points has less games more tables.

370
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,637
Speaker 1: But what packs prime?

371
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:56,570
Speaker 1: in 2008 when they had the unfinished?

372
00:22:56,831 --> 00:23:07,130
Speaker 1: Annex did not have as much space but because the space was organized into many many many small rooms It was a fucking awesome space, especially for role-playing games.

373
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was hand pecks east this past year in the BC EC while it was just one fucking gigantic room.

374
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,290
Speaker 1: That was a fucking gigantic room, right?

375
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,460
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is that number of table seats per person?

376
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:22,550
Speaker 0: the ratio at Connecticut is better than in either pack?

377
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,721
Speaker 1: Not if you count secret tabletop.

378
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,173
Speaker 0: I Can't count that.

379
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:28,499
Speaker 1: you can count that it's not.

380
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:31,810
Speaker 1: that was basically geek nights private tabletop anyway.

381
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,063
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Connecticut the deadline is May 10th to register.

382
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:46,719
Speaker 1: if you want to run a panel or a workshop If you are a geek nights listener and you want to run a panel or workshop go to the link I'm going to put in this, you know moves post whatever.

383
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,209
Speaker 1: I am the one who approves your panels.

384
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:55,636
Speaker 1: Yeah Also, if you know of anyone who you think should do a panel let them know.

385
00:23:55,676 --> 00:24:05,187
Speaker 1: give them a link to the forum, you know, whatever because We want to have some awesome panels and we were told last year the first year We were in charge that we in fact had the best list of panels Connecticut has ever had.

386
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:19,603
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah panels and your panel sucks submitted anyway And you'll get harshly rejected or you'll get accepted and then you'll get blacklisted Yep, and we do know pretty much everyone who accepts panels and every con in the East Coast.

387
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:20,847
Speaker 1: You'll get blackballed everywhere.

388
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:28,303
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, anyway All right, so we don't we don't talk about comics quite that often.

389
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,870
Speaker 0: mostly cuz rim doesn't read him that off.

390
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,978
Speaker 1: I just read a whole bunch of comics that I have to give you to read and then we'll do shows on him so I Can finally mail him back to Timo.

391
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:37,866
Speaker 0: Why don't we just give him back to him at this point?

392
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:38,930
Speaker 1: Cuz you should read him.

393
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,414
Speaker 1: They're really good.

394
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:41,530
Speaker 0: No, I mean give him back as in in person.

395
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:51,389
Speaker 1: Yeah because the same reason I didn't give Aaron Clark his suit back in Person because if he flies out somewhere and I give him a big package to then fly back with versus just shipping it to him.

396
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:54,338
Speaker 0: Anyway anyway, so this is comic.

397
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:56,164
Speaker 0: I read it quite a while ago.

398
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:59,950
Speaker 0: It comes out very slowly issue by issue.

399
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:06,490
Speaker 0: But when they get enough issues, they release these really big hardcovers that are really fancy that even have the little ribbon in them.

400
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:15,589
Speaker 0: it's so awesome, right and I bought the first hardcover and it was so awesome and You know it was but no one else ever read it but me.

401
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:23,644
Speaker 0: So I was like I got no one to talk about this thing with and it's something that Almost nobody knows about but almost everybody will think is the best thing ever.

402
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:24,887
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

403
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:27,758
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say straight up Yeah to head off the rest of the review.

404
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:30,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is it's a comic is called castle waiting, right?

405
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,896
Speaker 0: It's got the word castle in it.

406
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:32,278
Speaker 0: That's good.

407
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:47,790
Speaker 0: It's by a girl named Linda Medley and Basically the deal with castle waiting is this it's like this whole fairy tale world right and Basically, you know you think oh, there's a whole bunch of fairy tale comics out there like fables and shit.

408
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:48,196
Speaker 0: Why do we?

409
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:49,110
Speaker 0: why do we need another one?

410
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,826
Speaker 0: Well, this this isn't like fables where it takes existing fairy tales and sort of retells them, right?

411
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,251
Speaker 0: It's not like Oh Rapunzel.

412
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,356
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, whatever.

413
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:00,841
Speaker 0: It's its own.

414
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:04,150
Speaker 0: It's like a brand new fairy tale that never existed before.

415
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:06,297
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's put up by fan of graphics.

416
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,744
Speaker 1: It's just you know, black and white comic book.

417
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:08,990
Speaker 1: The tomes are pretty great.

418
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,877
Speaker 1: They have the little like fancy ribbon.

419
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,323
Speaker 0: I said there was a ribbon.

420
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:29,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ribbon bookmark built in is pretty fancy But if I had to say what it was briefly It's a slice of life set in a fantasy world that consists of a series of Semi-related Canterbury Tales almost styled fables just about all the people at this castle.

421
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,720
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's really slice of life, right?

422
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,363
Speaker 0: I think there is.

423
00:26:32,443 --> 00:26:33,970
Speaker 0: there is a core plot, right?

424
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:40,877
Speaker 0: So you have this this girl who is sort of a Sleeping Beauty ish Situation kind of sort of.

425
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,733
Speaker 1: we're gonna avoid spoiling a lot because it's just it's a pretty good comic and you should just read it.

426
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:52,210
Speaker 0: but basically the girl this girl's in this weird Sleeping Beauty kind of situation and Whatever it comes down to is she she's some sir.

427
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,729
Speaker 0: I think she's like a princess or who knows what she is or her dad was a merchant something like that.

428
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:58,789
Speaker 0: She is much older and she has a son.

429
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:04,309
Speaker 0: it was a little baby and the baby is obviously some kind of monster or something like a demon or who knows what.

430
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:13,750
Speaker 1: and She runs away and she ends up at this castle waiting Which is sort of not really a purgatory but like a sanctuary for all the dispossessed of the world.

431
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:20,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like this castle that used to be a big fancy castle that had fairy tale shit going down.

432
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:23,541
Speaker 0: But you know everyone at that castle sort of event.

433
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,610
Speaker 0: Most of the people at that castle sort of evacuated.

434
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:37,192
Speaker 0: It's like she ran away from her home in the normal sort of medieval world And ended up in sort of like this hidden fantasy castle that there's only a few people living there now All right.

435
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:41,410
Speaker 1: See now I say there's a bit of slice of life because it's like half of this is a contiguous narrative.

436
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:42,047
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

437
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:49,350
Speaker 1: I actually have to split up into thirds because a third of it is a continuous narrative of Like this main plot about the woman who's just joined with the baby.

438
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:55,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, another third of it is the tales of all the people who live there now and what their deal is.

439
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:56,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz well, I think what it does, right?

440
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,457
Speaker 0: She gets to this castle and you have to meet all the characters that already lived there which like sort of become her new Family, right?

441
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:08,970
Speaker 0: Cuz now she's living there with her baby So you meet all the people but then after that you really meet all the people, right?

442
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:17,569
Speaker 0: So there's the nun who lives there and then she's my second favorite and then they When they get then they basically they take that nun and they introduce you to her.

443
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,034
Speaker 0: So, you know her right.

444
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:34,652
Speaker 0: and then they come and they circle around back and they go off on this nuns whole history from like when she was a baby to her present day like that could cover the whole thing and it takes like half or more than half of a volume of Comic.

445
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:41,309
Speaker 1: that story is so engaging that you kind of forget the outside story and suddenly you're back in the modern time in the book And you're like, oh, whoa, whoa, wait

446
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:50,590
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like they go and they tell this whole character's story like it's a brand new comic and then they bring you back into the Main story of the girl who just showed up with her freaky baby, you know.

447
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:52,830
Speaker 0: And then I think they I think who knows right?

448
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,550
Speaker 0: Well, there's only two volumes so far and it comes out so slowly.

449
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:58,299
Speaker 0: But are they gonna do that for another character?

450
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,241
Speaker 0: They get to go off on the horse.

451
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:01,067
Speaker 0: guy and guys.

452
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:05,441
Speaker 0: my third favorite Let me guess your first favorite quiet guy the doctor.

453
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,207
Speaker 0: Oh you like the dog.

454
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,030
Speaker 0: I like the doctor.

455
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:15,158
Speaker 1: Oh, I like the quiet guy, but I like the doctor way more because he's Actually kind of cute in the way.

456
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:16,805
Speaker 1: He actually acts around people.

457
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:17,889
Speaker 0: He I don't know.

458
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:20,017
Speaker 1: He's very I don't know.

459
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:21,823
Speaker 1: It's this weird mix of shy.

460
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:26,030
Speaker 0: I actually kind of like the bird butler I mean everybody.

461
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:29,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's nearly no unlikable characters going on here.

462
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,624
Speaker 1: I really like the horse too.

463
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:39,633
Speaker 1: I got just because he's so rainbow - he You know he is yeah But the all.

464
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,502
Speaker 1: the final third is really this slice of life.

465
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:47,661
Speaker 1: you get a lot of just these like this view of What day to day life is like in this castle.

466
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:54,329
Speaker 1: when there's no plot on the outside nothing going on It's just oh the fairies are up to shit again, and the roof is leaking and we got to fix it.

467
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,898
Speaker 1: And oh here's how we get gold and just all these kind of mundane Day-to-day happy stories.

468
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:01,967
Speaker 1: you feel like you're almost living there with this family of.

469
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:03,857
Speaker 0: really I don't think you know.

470
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,467
Speaker 0: I think that slice-of-life stuff.

471
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:08,500
Speaker 0: I mean It's not a significant percentage of.

472
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,243
Speaker 0: I think it is.

473
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:10,550
Speaker 1: I think it's a solid third.

474
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,860
Speaker 1: No, I mean you forget how much of the story is just.

475
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:17,410
Speaker 1: it's not like the backstory of like the full history of a character.

476
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:19,630
Speaker 1: It's just them going about their day-to-day BS.

477
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:24,429
Speaker 0: I think it's mostly just a lot of that stuff is just there because they're introducing you.

478
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,654
Speaker 0: They're sort of teaching you.

479
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:31,984
Speaker 0: here's how life at the castle works right so that you're not like well How do they freaking live out in the middle of nowhere alone?

480
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:32,929
Speaker 0: Where do they get money from?

481
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:32,989
Speaker 0: oh?

482
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,636
Speaker 0: That's what they get.

483
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,900
Speaker 0: I didn't say that's not Answering all these questions.

484
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,470
Speaker 1: I didn't say that's not the purpose of it.

485
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:42,082
Speaker 0: I would not I would not categorize it as slaves of life in any.

486
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:47,118
Speaker 1: that aspect of it is definitely slice of life Slice of the lives of these people.

487
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:51,209
Speaker 0: there's yeah gee and any story you see the slice of the lives of the characters gasps.

488
00:30:52,132 --> 00:30:53,275
Speaker 0: That doesn't make it slice of.

489
00:30:53,295 --> 00:31:03,926
Speaker 1: there's definitely a difference between when you see what's going on that either Establishes characters or furthers plot in some specific way versus this kind of just voyeuristic.

490
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,430
Speaker 1: ah check this out.

491
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:13,230
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, no because all of those things they introduce are You know simply Chekhov's guns and/or explanations.

492
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,479
Speaker 0: I don't venture plots that follow.

493
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,210
Speaker 1: the leaky roof was not a Chekhov's gun for fucking anything.

494
00:31:18,318 --> 00:31:21,519
Speaker 0: Yeah It was what I forget, but it was definitely in there.

495
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:22,001
Speaker 0: cuz what?

496
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:22,302
Speaker 0: cuz?

497
00:31:22,322 --> 00:31:25,833
Speaker 0: then they started investigating like all the secret parts of the other Castle.

498
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:26,214
Speaker 1: they didn't.

499
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:27,599
Speaker 1: they did that because she wanted to move.

500
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,626
Speaker 1: yeah, I just read it.

501
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:30,649
Speaker 1: you read it a while ago.

502
00:31:31,591 --> 00:31:33,570
Speaker 0: Point is stuff is in there for a reason.

503
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:41,017
Speaker 1: I don't think the leaky roof is in there for any reason other than to show you a slice of the lives of these characters Goony interactions they have with those sprites.

504
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:43,505
Speaker 0: anyway the point is the sprites are kind of great.

505
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:46,449
Speaker 0: It's not slice of life It is a fairy tale.

506
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:49,923
Speaker 1: I said one third of it is slice of life.

507
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:51,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, no it is.

508
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:52,738
Speaker 1: You'll see when you read it.

509
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:54,530
Speaker 0: one third of everything is lies of life.

510
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:03,335
Speaker 1: But now now because there was no slice of life and the prince of nothing until it came in or us says Watha started shitting No That's some slice of life.

511
00:32:03,536 --> 00:32:05,222
Speaker 0: so it's only slice of life.

512
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:15,850
Speaker 0: if the slice of life if there is a portion If there are characters doing things that are mundane if there if there is any portion of the story where characters are doing mundane things Suddenly that slice of life, but if they show you

513
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,614
Speaker 1: I'm saying

514
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,129
Speaker 0: when they're doing things that are not mundane and every day that is

515
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:29,120
Speaker 1: of the comic has at least a third of it about has many of the Characteristics of what you'd see in a typical slice of life story word.

516
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:39,790
Speaker 1: you could take all those apart from the overall plot and Separately completely apart from the detailed histories of all the characters and they would still be an interesting story.

517
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,067
Speaker 1: There's just no plot other than yay these people living their lives.

518
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:44,730
Speaker 1: check it out.

519
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,919
Speaker 0: But there is a plot other than that up in those parts.

520
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,664
Speaker 0: Not really there is.

521
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:50,246
Speaker 0: there's.

522
00:32:50,286 --> 00:32:51,730
Speaker 0: the whole thing is a giant plot.

523
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is an overarching plot.

524
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,209
Speaker 1: I'm saying that a third of the comic is very slice-of-life esque.

525
00:32:57,751 --> 00:33:00,020
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's let's move on right.

526
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:07,168
Speaker 1: so I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand because it's not Anyway, so name any character from the comic?

527
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:13,568
Speaker 0: You know, I can't remember characters names shit Anyway, who can remember characters names?

528
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,113
Speaker 0: If you haven't read something yesterday, I mean, but you must Remember?

529
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,784
Speaker 1: No, you know you should eat some kiri.

530
00:33:21,824 --> 00:33:22,426
Speaker 1: That'll fix you.

531
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:28,706
Speaker 0: Sure Anyway, so yeah the thing with castle waiting right is you've got so the camera.

532
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,755
Speaker 0: we didn't really go down the list of all The characters, right?

533
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,455
Speaker 0: So there's the girl who shows up with Her baby, that's a monster, right?

534
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:35,358
Speaker 1: He's a Leshy.

535
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,950
Speaker 0: I think yeah, he's some sort of monster Leshy something like that.

536
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:42,061
Speaker 1: I learned about Leshy's from quest for glory for no shit.

537
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:43,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a. it's a fantasy thing.

538
00:33:43,706 --> 00:33:44,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're in there.

539
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,149
Speaker 1: There's this I saved one.

540
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:53,321
Speaker 0: There's this bird butler guy who's sort of like the mayor or like the head he takes care of all like, you know The business and the accounting and all that right.

541
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,518
Speaker 0: so he sort of makes sure that you know Everything is taken care of.

542
00:33:56,699 --> 00:34:00,617
Speaker 0: he has a fangirl - yeah There's that the horse guy.

543
00:34:00,677 --> 00:34:05,710
Speaker 0: he's actually a horse guy rainbow - yeah Oh, his name is like chest or something like that, right?

544
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:11,947
Speaker 1: Because there's basically the world is a fancy world where about a third a quarter of the people are animal people.

545
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:20,087
Speaker 0: Yeah There's the nun who is like from this weird, you know, they tell it you get the whole nun story Jesus.

546
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:22,733
Speaker 0: Yeah And she's like this.

547
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:29,636
Speaker 0: she has like this epic story of nunnage and it's like, you know, it's like the ultimate Feminist nuns of awesome.

548
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:31,523
Speaker 1: Don't forget her hanging out with a little demon guy.

549
00:34:31,563 --> 00:34:32,746
Speaker 1: He was actually pretty chill.

550
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:33,590
Speaker 0: That's right.

551
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,360
Speaker 0: Like she hangs out.

552
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:34,949
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right.

553
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,889
Speaker 0: There's like the evil demon who's like chasing the the baby who works for the witch in the woods.

554
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,449
Speaker 1: But you know the witch in the woods is really the only bitch we've met so far.

555
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:45,053
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like.

556
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:46,768
Speaker 0: that's the only bad guy she gets hers.

557
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,254
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like a witch.

558
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:54,726
Speaker 0: it is a witch in the woods and the imp that works for it and only the nun really knows the imp Is visiting and she talks to it, but no one else even knows.

559
00:34:54,786 --> 00:34:57,078
Speaker 0: is there The store?

560
00:34:57,118 --> 00:35:05,011
Speaker 1: the comic has a lot of those Semi like enemies who know each other and are actually kind of friends and they just kind of do the job of fighting with each Other.

561
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:08,682
Speaker 1: a lot of the characters have those kind of ripping on each other relationships.

562
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:13,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, there isn't really a whole lot of that You know, even though it's a fantasy thing.

563
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:20,270
Speaker 0: There's no Dragons and swords and actually like straight-up fighting or magical battles, at least not yet, right?

564
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,575
Speaker 0: I mean there probably aren't gonna be.

565
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:24,066
Speaker 0: it's mostly you know, there is a fantasy world.

566
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:32,330
Speaker 0: There is magic There is monsters and whatever but nobody's really having direct, you know, like fighting conflict.

567
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:37,785
Speaker 0: It's mostly sort of everyday social conflict and everyday problems.

568
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:41,598
Speaker 0: conflict like oh crap We need you know supplies.

569
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,502
Speaker 0: We went to town.

570
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:50,930
Speaker 0: Oh, no, all our money is gone You know, that's the kind of problems they run into not problems like, you know, oh crap the dragons trying to eat me.

571
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:56,829
Speaker 0: We must slay him you're not gonna you know There's none of that even though it's heavily implied that the world is full of that.

572
00:35:57,233 --> 00:36:04,110
Speaker 0: There isn't any of that in this Castle waiting and I guess that's partially because castle waiting is sort of like the safe place, right?

573
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,010
Speaker 0: So anything like that sort of stays outside.

574
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:10,141
Speaker 1: I'm curious what would happen if the castle were actually besieged.

575
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:11,987
Speaker 0: I wonder if it could be besieged right?

576
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:12,770
Speaker 0: There's the hedge maze.

577
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know but at the same time there's the path through the hedge maze.

578
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:16,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's cuz.

579
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:18,139
Speaker 0: he clears it out all the time.

580
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, which if the dragon was coming they just let it hedge in.

581
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:22,156
Speaker 1: How fast it hedges?

582
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:24,105
Speaker 1: we don't know these things, but it's a magical hedge maze.

583
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:28,529
Speaker 1: It might just close instantly Yeah, but if it closes instantly, then how is he constantly clearing it?

584
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:30,217
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

585
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,081
Speaker 0: there's a lot of.

586
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:31,663
Speaker 0: there's a lot of.

587
00:36:31,684 --> 00:36:33,010
Speaker 0: you know, sort of you know.

588
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,850
Speaker 0: A lot of the magic is sort of that quirky sort of you know, misbehaving nature stuff, right?

589
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,244
Speaker 1: It's like the dirty old water spirits pretty great dirty old just a naked old man.

590
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,327
Speaker 1: Who's totally lecherous.

591
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:46,840
Speaker 0: Yeah He lives in the well, right?

592
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the stream?

593
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:51,100
Speaker 0: Oh, no, that's why the water was dropping from the ceiling.

594
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,790
Speaker 0: cuz that was the dirty old lecture getting into the thing.

595
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,216
Speaker 0: It wasn't actually rain or anything.

596
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:56,180
Speaker 1: He was just being a dick.

597
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there was actually a reason for it.

598
00:36:58,811 --> 00:37:00,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't say there was no reason for it.

599
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:02,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it served no plot purpose.

600
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:03,332
Speaker 0: It did.

601
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,277
Speaker 0: is it what to introduce you to the water?

602
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:09,028
Speaker 1: He was already introduced long time before to make a funny.

603
00:37:09,048 --> 00:37:15,482
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah castle waiting is like, you know, I don't it's.

604
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:15,723
Speaker 0: it's.

605
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,649
Speaker 0: it's weird because it's like people know about it.

606
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:27,762
Speaker 0: It sells right and it's won awards and it's like so right but it's like you never hear anybody talk about it You know, it's like because I think it's cuz it just comes out so slowly.

607
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,890
Speaker 0: I mean it goes on hiatus.

608
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:35,762
Speaker 0: I mean this thing actually right according to Right the Linda Medley, right?

609
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:42,597
Speaker 0: She first thought of it in 1984 right and then They published seven issues.

610
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:47,192
Speaker 0: She self-published seven issues is according to Wikipedia in 1997 okay.

611
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:54,681
Speaker 0: And then in 1999 there was one hiatus issue, right?

612
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:55,564
Speaker 0: It's like oh my god.

613
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:56,888
Speaker 0: How many years is this?

614
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:57,209
Speaker 0: Right?

615
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:58,013
Speaker 0: This is 1997 was how long ago?

616
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,796
Speaker 1: Long time 15 years, right?

617
00:38:02,836 --> 00:38:04,722
Speaker 1: So they insult the xkcd.

618
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:07,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, so she published four issues in the year.

619
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:11,739
Speaker 0: Okay, it's like how many you know, she kept going and going it.

620
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:16,572
Speaker 0: few issues here few issues there and somehow in o6 They were able to.

621
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:24,758
Speaker 0: all the issues combined were enough to make the first hardcover and then in 2010 November last year They had the second hardcover.

622
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,649
Speaker 0: So and she's currently taking a break.

623
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:34,929
Speaker 0: So at this rate, let's see o6 and 2014 will get volume 3 Maybe 2015 something like that.

624
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:47,210
Speaker 1: Yeah Which is kind of frustrating because you'll probably like this comic and read through it pretty quick and you'll hit the end of all the books that are out and then Waiting and it's like this is it's a continuing story.

625
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:53,835
Speaker 1: There is a plot right and rate at which it's being told there's gonna be like a hundred volumes But it's like gonna be preserved.

626
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:56,182
Speaker 0: Is it even gonna finish berserk?

627
00:38:56,483 --> 00:38:57,426
Speaker 0: Yeah berserk.

628
00:38:57,747 --> 00:39:04,490
Speaker 0: This is one of those things It's like, you know There is a continuing plot that'll probably never be resolved just because it gets published so slowly.

629
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:06,176
Speaker 1: Thing is it's worth reading.

630
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:09,970
Speaker 1: Anyway, I had great fun reading it and I look forward to eventually reading more of it.

631
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:14,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is that you know The book does have a message right and it all.

632
00:39:14,378 --> 00:39:16,925
Speaker 0: it's often like a feminist message, right?

633
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,396
Speaker 0: My favorite part was when You know the the story about the Miller.

634
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:26,270
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and the Miller was like, oh, I need someone to work the mill, right?

635
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,222
Speaker 0: He's like, I don't have enough hands and the guys like what about those hands?

636
00:39:29,282 --> 00:39:32,148
Speaker 0: and he points it like the Miller's wife or daughter Who isn't doing anything?

637
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,174
Speaker 0: And he's like, oh snap.

638
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:34,917
Speaker 1: He's got.

639
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,663
Speaker 1: how many coins did he throw in the shit?

640
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:37,646
Speaker 0: I forget.

641
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,710
Speaker 1: I don't remember that part.

642
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:41,619
Speaker 1: They owe the Miller like three gold coins.

643
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,808
Speaker 1: he tosses two into the shit and he's like well fish him out.

644
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:46,973
Speaker 1: Yeah Only two.

645
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:47,073
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,908
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway, but but yeah this it's it's.

647
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:52,349
Speaker 0: it's.

648
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:58,004
Speaker 0: It's a good kind of feminist message where it's like, you know, it's not it's not man-hating.

649
00:39:58,385 --> 00:39:58,946
Speaker 0: It's not.

650
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:02,513
Speaker 0: you know, like, you know Scary women.

651
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:03,075
Speaker 0: It's like.

652
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:04,940
Speaker 1: what do you mean scary women?

653
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:22,570
Speaker 0: You know that kind of feminism that's like, you know women you You know the stuff is not really good fundamentals, but yeah, it's not the stereotypical Not real feminism of like, you know, he-man women-hating Amazon situation, right?

654
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,862
Speaker 0: It's it's like, you know actual feminism like.

655
00:40:26,183 --> 00:40:30,750
Speaker 0: hey, you know men are cool You know, it doesn't portray men in any bad way, you know.

656
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,584
Speaker 0: But it portrays, you know women as an intelligent way.

657
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:43,541
Speaker 0: and the lesson is often You know feminist in nature and in most of the story moral in general of every story of Castle waiting seems to come down to.

658
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:44,869
Speaker 1: don't be a dick.

659
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:51,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much but it's usually women that are being dicked to you know in the stories, right?

660
00:40:52,190 --> 00:41:09,210
Speaker 0: Because it's and that's I think that's part of why it's in sort of this medieval setting right because you have this sort of you know actual medieval Society, you know where they've got things like arranged marriages and You know All kinds of stuff like that, right?

661
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,930
Speaker 0: You know women can't work and all that sort of stuff that you would have medieval society.

662
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:28,570
Speaker 0: but in the fantasy medieval society by contrast, you've got like witches and princesses and You know like all that kind of stuff, right and it's the contrast between those things that is used to illustrate a lot of these morals.

663
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:34,189
Speaker 1: So, I mean in conclusion it's worth reading and you should read it.

664
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:45,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people looking for you know indie comics in the in the you know If they're not coming out quickly enough for you to really fancy hardcover books easy to buy Can't go wrong.

665
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,992
Speaker 0: Totally awesome hidden treasure Right.
