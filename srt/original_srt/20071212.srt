00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,445
Speaker 0: was it entertaining to hear people talk about a thing that you experienced yourself?

12
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:46,335
Speaker 1: see I've always found it that way Listen to look before.

13
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:47,641
Speaker 1: I you know did this.

14
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:54,838
Speaker 1: when I listen to other people do like con reports There's always like wow I didn't see that at the con or man I miss that see I think also.

15
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:59,775
Speaker 0: in addition if you you know you you saw us at the con in some way And you thought we were entertaining.

16
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:01,342
Speaker 0: maybe you're not quite sure that.

17
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:13,510
Speaker 0: maybe you want to become a. you know Spend four hours of your life every week listening to this if you were at the con And you listen to us talk about it And you go mmm and nodding your head in agreement at the things we say.

18
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:20,246
Speaker 0: Maybe listening is a good idea and Maybe if you listen and you go what the fuck you guys are full of shit at all the things.

19
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:25,062
Speaker 0: we say maybe listening is A good idea, maybe you're you're better off listening to anime pulse.

20
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:25,785
Speaker 0: No.

21
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,350
Speaker 0: No I said, maybe listening is a good idea.

22
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, listen what I said.

23
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:33,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, all right, so you remember how I had trouble sorting all my musics.

24
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:39,718
Speaker 1: I do and I remember my advice was always well Shouldn't have gotten into this situation.

25
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,522
Speaker 1: keep your music in.

26
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:42,130
Speaker 0: we offered no useful solution.

27
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:45,505
Speaker 1: Well I offered one solution which was delete everything and then torrent.

28
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:49,378
Speaker 0: yeah great well I have a new solution delete everything in torrent.

29
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,890
Speaker 0: No the new solution is every day do a few albums.

30
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:53,874
Speaker 0: It's every day.

31
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:54,396
Speaker 0: It's gonna.

32
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,470
Speaker 0: Do a little bit like in the morning like so baby steps.

33
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:08,350
Speaker 0: yeah, and as long and as long as I don't acquire new music or Acquire music at a rate less than the rate at which I sort music eventually it all be done.

34
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:17,349
Speaker 0: Basically my strategy is for example on the first day right which was today I guess you know I took I went in and I said all right what I want.

35
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,216
Speaker 0: I said I want some Daft Punk's.

36
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:22,830
Speaker 0: I looked in the Daft Punk folder which kind of you know cuz it's still semi sorted.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,030
Speaker 0: You know so and there wasn't much in there.

38
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,449
Speaker 0: I mean there was Daft Punk songs But not every Daft Punk song and you know I knew there was more.

39
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:35,370
Speaker 0: So I went and I got a bunch of Daft Punk torrents, and I down torrented every album.

40
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:42,579
Speaker 0: I checked Wikipedia for the discography and then I Sorted them with the music brains thingy, which I had.

41
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,010
Speaker 0: there's a newer better one that works better, and there I had it.

42
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:59,372
Speaker 0: I had a few albums, and I deleted my old stuff, so I'm doing this sort of slow replace But also we'll see how long this keeps up, but also in addition to these slow replace There are also some things I have that are sort of Unreplaceable.

43
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,115
Speaker 0: so those I'm.

44
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:10,361
Speaker 0: what I'm thinking is I'll do the slow replace of all the replaceables And then all the non replaceables will be left over and there won't be all these Replaceables in the way and it'll be much easier to handle those.

45
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:17,808
Speaker 0: well then those you can put in the rare directory Maybe but rare usually means like opener to a single anime.

46
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,675
Speaker 1: now I got some weird stuff like.

47
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:24,390
Speaker 1: I got that random recording of like a yokokano playing the eska flown a theme on a piano.

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like that.

49
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:25,881
Speaker 0: What is that?

50
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,848
Speaker 0: It's just like a bootleg mp3.

51
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,138
Speaker 0: There's no album or anything to sort.

52
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:30,223
Speaker 1: it goes it for me.

53
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,226
Speaker 1: It goes in the yokokano directory I guess I guess.

54
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:42,570
Speaker 0: but In addition to that I'll probably be You know finding all sorts of amazing new old musics that I've had lying around on my mp3 folders.

55
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,150
Speaker 0: Ah, we'll see if any of those make it anywhere in the show or anything.

56
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:52,003
Speaker 1: But anyway because no one wants to hear about that before we get to the you know I think some people want to hear coverage of the con.

57
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,174
Speaker 1: you know all you new listeners We do news.

58
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,348
Speaker 1: at the beginning we talk a little bit about what's going on in the anime world.

59
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:59,489
Speaker 1: so Scott What is going on in the anime world?

60
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,236
Speaker 0: What is indeed going on in the animal world?

61
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:22,430
Speaker 0: many many awesome things, but perhaps the most awesome thing well I don't know if it's the most awesome is There was quite an announcement at the the New York anime festival an announcement that was anticipated because well I don't know you couldn't see it a mile away, but when you look to the con schedule there were many panels.

62
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:28,322
Speaker 0: There was a. there was you know a Tokyo pop panel Vertical panel of his panel whatever.

63
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:33,520
Speaker 0: there was also a Del Rey panel And then there was a Del Rey and Marvel panel.

64
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,610
Speaker 0: and well if that doesn't give everything away.

65
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean what.

66
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:42,830
Speaker 1: they were just gonna have some Del Rey guys and some Marvel guys talk about something together.

67
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:44,864
Speaker 1: Just you know nothing special.

68
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:49,626
Speaker 0: It's like they Just announcing the scheduling of the panel.

69
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,650
Speaker 0: they sort of gave away.

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,085
Speaker 0: You couldn't really keep the secret of some sort of Del Rey Marvel partnership.

71
00:04:55,146 --> 00:05:00,649
Speaker 1: now the panel was Sunday And as many of you went to the con might have known Sunday was not our best day.

72
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,421
Speaker 0: The Sunday was not the best day.

73
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,850
Speaker 0: I'll talk about that soon enough.

74
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,370
Speaker 1: We did not make it to the panel to do our sort of coverage of it.

75
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,450
Speaker 0: No, but that's not necessary because anime news network covered everything.

76
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:16,410
Speaker 0: So we're not really gonna talk about much other news from the con unless you have something to add you know to the story.

77
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,658
Speaker 1: I have one very important piece of news from the con.

78
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,167
Speaker 1: Peter Fernandez has a sexy voice.

79
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:26,146
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah good God he is like professional radio voice better than us ever.

80
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,830
Speaker 0: but anyway What they did specifically announce is that they're gonna make some?

81
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,545
Speaker 0: Mangas with some x-men's in it.

82
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:40,250
Speaker 0: Aha, but you know manga is in quotes because it's you know not made in Japan for a Japanese audience in a Japanese magazine.

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,730
Speaker 0: It's just gonna be you know published in you know digest format in the US as you know.

84
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,324
Speaker 1: Is it just that it's gonna be published in trades, or is it gonna be in the?

85
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:55,350
Speaker 1: I hate to say something like this But the quote-unquote marketing speak manga style.

86
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:05,183
Speaker 0: It's gonna be in the manga style the oels of the world mangas or whatever you want to call them and basically They're gonna make a shoujo a shoujo x-men right where it.

87
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:07,088
Speaker 1: Oh, so it'll be just like the movies.

88
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,236
Speaker 0: well It's gonna be like kitty pride is the only girl in the all boys Pride is like the best.

89
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:12,718
Speaker 1: all right.

90
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:17,438
Speaker 0: the kitty pride is the only girl in the all boys Xavier school for gifted youngsters.

91
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:18,863
Speaker 1: wait wait wait wait wait.

92
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,550
Speaker 1: what about rogue?

93
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,776
Speaker 0: What about Jubilee?

94
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,004
Speaker 0: not gonna be there Jean Grey?

95
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:26,521
Speaker 0: not gonna be there I can understand, but or at least not gonna be in the school.

96
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,269
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll be outside the school somewhere.

97
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,729
Speaker 0: ah But yeah, and the other one is gonna be shown in Wolverine where Wolverines badass cutting people up.

98
00:06:35,171 --> 00:06:37,946
Speaker 1: So won't it just be lone wolf and Cobb man.

99
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:38,449
Speaker 0: I don't know.

100
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:42,500
Speaker 0: that's Lone wolf and Cobb then Wolverine then lone wolf and come again.

101
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:45,532
Speaker 1: who knows it's just gonna be lone wolf and Cobb only without the Cub.

102
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,530
Speaker 0: who knows it'll probably more like a Naruto style.

103
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:51,360
Speaker 0: Wolverine is using the special techniques.

104
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,882
Speaker 0: You know like.

105
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,799
Speaker 0: oh, no, so I can't beat you saber-tooth I'll have to use my spinny slashy.

106
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,728
Speaker 0: Oh, no is to use the spinny slashy.

107
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:03,309
Speaker 0: oh You cannot defeat my healing powers.

108
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:07,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's kind of cool.

109
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,094
Speaker 0: I guess I know.

110
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:12,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, what?

111
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:19,630
Speaker 0: In the past Marvel has tried this manga thing before manga thing before with their Marvel manga verse.

112
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,669
Speaker 0: You know where they made in American comic style format, but also Marvel digest for.

113
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:35,589
Speaker 1: well I think they've realized one thing that regardless of the reasons behind it the fact remains that Even average manga outsell pretty much any comic in the u.s.. A billion to one.

114
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:43,110
Speaker 0: well That's true, but I think the problem here, and it clearly shows the problem Is that these companies even the manga companies?

115
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:56,078
Speaker 0: I guess vertical understands, but the other companies like Viz and I guess Del Rey especially Del Rey and Marvel especially at least They know that manga is popular But they still don't understand why.

116
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:56,920
Speaker 0: and it's like they.

117
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,006
Speaker 0: they see what makes it different.

118
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:02,604
Speaker 0: right because it's sort of obvious Why it's different, but they're not.

119
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:03,450
Speaker 0: they can't fake.

120
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,530
Speaker 0: They don't truly know the exact things the reason why it sells more.

121
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,943
Speaker 0: They're just like.

122
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:11,557
Speaker 0: well It's different in these ways and it sells more.

123
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,985
Speaker 0: so let's make something in those ways now.

124
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,650
Speaker 1: granted this can cause some good effects.

125
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,228
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not just because they're in trades that they tend to do better.

126
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:24,950
Speaker 1: however I would be a much happier man if I never saw a single issue of any comic ever released ever again.

127
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:32,394
Speaker 0: But they seem to think still that it's the artistic style that would makes these things sell or the fact that they're right to left That makes them sell.

128
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:35,630
Speaker 0: you know it's people don't buy manga because it's right to left.

129
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:38,630
Speaker 0: You know people would buy manga if it was left to right.

130
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,796
Speaker 0: It's but they it's.

131
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,250
Speaker 0: the thing is because it was originally right to left.

132
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,618
Speaker 0: They like it to be the original way.

133
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,127
Speaker 0: it has nothing to do with you know as people aren't going.

134
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:49,838
Speaker 0: oh, man I'm buying this manga because it's cool.

135
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,602
Speaker 0: It's backwards.

136
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:51,666
Speaker 0: That's why I'm buying it.

137
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:52,430
Speaker 0: That's not how it is.

138
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,342
Speaker 0: They're also not saying check it out as a stereotypical anime styling.

139
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,485
Speaker 0: That's why I'm gonna buy it.

140
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,328
Speaker 0: That's not granted.

141
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:04,350
Speaker 1: at the same time I think the fact that a lot of at least the manga that's brought out commonly in the u.s.

142
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:12,719
Speaker 1: I mean there is manga that looks very different, but we don't see a lot of that over here sadly, but People who see it saw that in the store especially.

143
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:20,690
Speaker 1: you know in the early days of manga being brought over shoujo manga Especially it was just a breath of fresh air compared to big muscly men to hit another big muscly man.

144
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,150
Speaker 1: I'll hit you you little guy.

145
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:35,288
Speaker 0: the only reason why Manga and anime are popular and what made them popular in the first place is you had people who grew up on animation and comics right and They still liked animation in comics And they wanted more.

146
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:41,550
Speaker 0: But the only supply of animation in comics was designed to appeal to a very young audience and people grew out of that.

147
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:44,796
Speaker 0: You know I mean Rugrats is only funny.

148
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:49,490
Speaker 0: you know Nick tunes could only entertain you until you were such an age until which they stopped being entertaining.

149
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:53,482
Speaker 1: I mean as to counter that Doug is always entertaining.

150
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:54,626
Speaker 1: That's your original.

151
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:55,328
Speaker 0: I didn't say Doug.

152
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:58,552
Speaker 1: I said rugrats Yeah, they're the same kind Right.

153
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,780
Speaker 0: so things like the Simpsons and the family guy and the MTV.

154
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:03,545
Speaker 0: you know animations and whatever.

155
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:04,548
Speaker 0: you know they.

156
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,496
Speaker 0: they were working But not they didn't.

157
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:12,400
Speaker 0: you know beavis of a head, but they didn't fulfill the desire And they didn't you know they weren't didn't have the mass appeal you know.

158
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,390
Speaker 0: so the animes came on the sci-fi channel and people who?

159
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:16,234
Speaker 0: Animation.

160
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:24,663
Speaker 0: but grew out of Nick tunes and whatever said wow look at that It's an animation that appeals to an older audience to me that is made for me.

161
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:25,546
Speaker 0: That's so awesome.

162
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:30,509
Speaker 1: now granted older audience I was in fourth grade, and I saw vampire hunter D.

163
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,076
Speaker 0: That's all that's about the right.

164
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:38,918
Speaker 1: and my fourth grade brain was was saying to myself Wow that guy just got cut in half.

165
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:39,540
Speaker 1: Yep.

166
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,483
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

167
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:40,723
Speaker 1: Yep.

168
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:42,750
Speaker 1: I'm what is this called anime?

169
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:44,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna watch every anime.

170
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:52,873
Speaker 0: I find all they have to do is take a lot of people in half that just take an intelligent mature Cut.

171
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:54,058
Speaker 0: you know storyline.

172
00:10:54,098 --> 00:11:01,548
Speaker 1: yes because vampire hunter D was such a deep But she was with a big it you know compared to any other cartoon kids were watching back then.

173
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:13,942
Speaker 0: I mean yeah Yeah, exactly have a beginning a middle and an end with no crossover bullshit and publish it in a format that is Financially feasible for someone in the target audience to buy.

174
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:15,206
Speaker 0: that's all you have to do.

175
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:20,884
Speaker 0: all this other stuff that you're doing Like let's make it in this kind of artistic style make it in this kind.

176
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,610
Speaker 0: That's not necessary.

177
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:28,117
Speaker 0: That's not the reason this stuff is popular in the first place, but you don't seem to understand that And I don't know if you ever will.

178
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:35,470
Speaker 1: I mean at the same time I did hear that those Manga II looking spider-man comics sold a lot better than a lot of other spider-man comics.

179
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,581
Speaker 0: That's quite possible, but that's also.

180
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:41,090
Speaker 0: I think a lot of those are published in the digest format.

181
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,511
Speaker 1: see I don't.

182
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,938
Speaker 1: I think that there might also be.

183
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:45,770
Speaker 1: just in the culture of people are reading manga.

184
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,430
Speaker 1: They I mean and I'll say when I see it of spandex wearing muscle man.

185
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:59,256
Speaker 1: I really have very much difficulty in seeing any sort of meaningful or interesting plot behind that Spandex covered muscly man.

186
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:00,841
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is harder.

187
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,690
Speaker 0: There is no doubt especially if it's drawn in the old style.

188
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,007
Speaker 1: I mean there is the exception and I say exception cuz it's pretty well.

189
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:07,911
Speaker 1: There's a couple I guess.

190
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:13,750

Speaker 0: also.

236
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,870
Speaker 0: I don't know if that Tezuka thing is still in San Francisco.

237
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:08,754
Speaker 0: My parents saw it.

238
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:09,498

239
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,085
Speaker 1: did they see it in San Francisco.

240
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:25,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right There's also the woodblock thing there, which is ten times better than the Tezuka thing, but you know it's not comics Things of the day.

241
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:39,170
Speaker 1: So uh I was going through my papers a while ago and I just found something that was kind of amazing and I feel like it's my duty as a Human being in an anime fan to fill this out and send it in all right now.

242
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:48,553
Speaker 1: I'll let you all guess what year it's from but I found a Central Park Media Survey that came with some sort of anime that I bought at some point in my life Mm-hmm.

243
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,287
Speaker 1: now this survey asks a lot of important questions.

244
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,133
Speaker 1: for example What is my age?

245
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:55,199
Speaker 1: and I like how they break down these demographics?

246
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,614
Speaker 1: It's like under 17 18 to 35 35 to 50 or over 50?

247
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:10,106
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, they really because I think they're forgetting that there's like this 18 to 25 year old like college kid demographic.

248
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:14,437
Speaker 1: that information is basically useless I know or out annual household income.

249
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:15,560
Speaker 1: it maxes out.

250
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,836
Speaker 1: It's like over 50,000 much less than 50,000 Alrighty, but here's where it gets really fun.

251
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:22,680
Speaker 1: It's like what equipment.

252
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,110

Speaker 1: VHS.

257
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:31,376
Speaker 1: I guess we still have a VCR though.

258
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:33,724
Speaker 1: I haven't plugged it in yep eight millimeter.

259

Speaker 0: it's VCD.

263
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,183
Speaker 0: They're talking about right.

264
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,391
Speaker 1: Uh I think they're - I don't know.

265
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:42,033
Speaker 0: Where's the laser?

266
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,939
Speaker 1: They're probably talking about laser disc.

267
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,263
Speaker 0: We don't have laser disc.

268
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:46,085

Speaker 1: yep projection TV.

272
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,284
Speaker 0: no no no no.

273
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:53,146
Speaker 1: now.

274
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,049
Speaker 1: Do we get our anime?

275
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,390
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess this is only asking about video cassettes.

276
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,462
Speaker 1: I mean how many video cassettes do I purchase in a month?

277
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:01,690
Speaker 1: how often do I rent video cassettes?

278
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,683
Speaker 1: Zero zero and I think my favorite good how many videos do you purchase an average year?

279
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,990
Speaker 1: and it's pretty much zero more than ten.

280
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:13,071
Speaker 1: All right, I Don't know.

281
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:13,593
Speaker 1: I mean this.

282
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,441
Speaker 1: this is like a piece of history.

283
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,530
Speaker 1: I mean CPM is almost out of business.

284
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,250
Speaker 1: They're like a bacteria that turned into a spore, and it's just desperately waiting for the water to come back.

285
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:28,630
Speaker 0: They confirmed that their panel at the New York anime festival that they're sort of in like low-cost mode like they're not doing anything.

286
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,910
Speaker 0: They're just chilling out and you know building back up.

287
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,270
Speaker 0: You know they're basically it's sort of like when you put the set it you put the tat in civilization, too.

288
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,009
Speaker 0: You know you you don't make any war you stop building anything.

289
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,807
Speaker 0: You just capitalism and and tax and just chill until you get to.

290
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:47,410
Speaker 0: you know you get stable So you can go at it again, and that's sort of what they're doing.

291
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not a bad plan at least.

292
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:50,461
Speaker 0: We're not just going out of business.

293
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:57,550
Speaker 0: You know horribly or whatever you know, but Also, they did a funny thing after their panel on Sunday because it was a late Sunday panel.

294
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,326
Speaker 0: They said anyone with a red bag can go to our booth and take whatever they want.

295
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:04,414
Speaker 1: now That's dangerous.

296
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:05,358
Speaker 1: That was a trap.

297
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,670
Speaker 1: I mean especially since you don't want any that stuff I do that my favorite thing was CPM.

298
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:16,349
Speaker 1: You know cuz they have a lot of licenses to let or DVD stocks of some old awful anime.

299
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:29,489
Speaker 1: I mean they're awesome in one sense because they're not so bad that they're just not watchable like Odeon, but They're kind of awesome and that they're the kind of thing you can watch with all your friends and enjoy immensely especially if you're drinking

300
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,292
Speaker 0: Mmm,

301
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:30,713
Speaker 1: but

302
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:32,379
Speaker 0: I have some a few good shows too.

303
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but they were selling.

304
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:45,080
Speaker 1: It looked like they basically bundled together like 12 of the worst anime they had and they were selling it as a box set for Like 40 bucks is the CPM collection.

305
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,525
Speaker 1: and the scary thing was.

306
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:52,650
Speaker 1: at first I thought oh, man I'm totally gonna buy that and then I realized that I already own more than half of those DVDs.

307
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:54,822
Speaker 0: No, actually that box at 12.

308
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:56,170
Speaker 0: I think we owned actually none of those.

309
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,783
Speaker 1: No, cuz it had silent service in there, which is all right.

310
00:17:58,803 --> 00:17:59,587
Speaker 0: We own one of them.

311
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:05,985
Speaker 1: I think we own a couple more - you forget that I have Graffler Baki and a bunch of that wasn't in there though.

312
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:06,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

313
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,156
Speaker 0: no I wasn't in that box that I saw.

314
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:09,481
Speaker 1: they might have had more than one box.

315
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,489
Speaker 0: then maybe they just had boxes of 12 But I saw one box.

316
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:21,210
Speaker 1: You know, they have so few employees so it was someone's job to sit there and decide what DVDs to put in these bundles.

317
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:22,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

318
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:23,488
Speaker 0: Oh, well CPM.

319
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:34,363
Speaker 0: Well, I think the cool thing about this survey is you know in Japan when you get say shot and jump There's always a survey in the back You know or any anthology and it always asks you which manga did you like which one?

320
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,190
Speaker 0: didn't you like whatever and you send it?

321
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,530
Speaker 0: In you could win prizes and get free stuff and whatever.

322
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:47,440
Speaker 0: But that's how they know which ones are popular and which ones aren't is based on those surveys and they give the high return rate On those surveys like a ludicrously high return rate.

323
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:57,250
Speaker 0: So the early anime industry I don't know if they copied that from the Japanese manga, you know companies the survey thing But they were doing the survey thing and now they're not doing the survey thing.

324
00:18:57,732 --> 00:19:00,241
Speaker 0: I think they should do the survey thing some more and right.

325
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:06,220
Speaker 1: if this survey reeks of like late 80s early 90s Absolutely incompetent at making a survey.

326
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,910
Speaker 0: that'll be used to be a modern Competence because I remember I used to use these all and also give me something free for mailing it in.

327
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:22,610
Speaker 1: you know back in the day when I'd spend my 35 or 40 bucks on a single VHS tape with three or four subtitled episodes of a show One of these would always be in it and I always fill it out and send it back.

328
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:24,484
Speaker 1: I don't know why I didn't send this one back.

329
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:29,029
Speaker 0: All right All right, so we are not the fans of the moe so much.

330
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:42,141
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess this you know, you can argue about what's moe and what's not, you know Cuz we like you it suppose and I was among adios and I guess there might be some things you might be able to legitimately Call like moe saying in that we would also like.

331
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,530
Speaker 1: but I think the line just has to be.

332
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:48,526
Speaker 1: there are things that I like and things that I don't like in labels that can apply to either.

333
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:53,850
Speaker 1: because you know, I like I was among Adio, but I don't like creepy whatever that I saw at the con.

334
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:57,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean generally we use the word moe to apply to.

335
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:15,264
Speaker 0: you know the anime that you know things in anime that are there and the only way you could enjoy them is If you're a pervert who got jollies by looking at cute underage things Right, and but I thought moe was pure.

336
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:22,530
Speaker 1: It's not a sexual attraction It's just this intimate understanding of the helplessness of this cute thing and you just want to protect it.

337
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:26,449
Speaker 0: It is but that's just the excuse to cover up the pedophile isms.

338
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:30,662
Speaker 1: I'll bet there's at least a couple of people who actually do just feel that way.

339
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:32,870
Speaker 0: there might be but that's also kind of scary.

340
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,610
Speaker 1: Regardless, I think found Scott an example of when moe can be awesome, right?

341
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,530
Speaker 0: So so here is an example of when moe can be not so bad or at least I don't know if it's moe or not.

342
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:54,410
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter, you know, they have like those moe tans which are like moe representations of like computer things OS time Yeah, and then they have those other ones that are like representations of like military vehicles.

343
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,937
Speaker 1: I'm a consumer.

344
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:56,561
Speaker 0: All right.

345
00:20:56,601 --> 00:21:00,769
Speaker 0: Well, here's one where They did every pokemons.

346
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:08,470
Speaker 0: This is so adorable every pokemons in the moe style and but not just in the moe style and also in the pokémon style.

347
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:11,341
Speaker 0: And then there's a little song and they go through.

348
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:13,148
Speaker 0: they say all the names of all the pokémon.

349
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,716
Speaker 1: so far My favorite one is Diglett.

350
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:16,604
Speaker 0: I don't know that Gengar was pretty good.

351
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:17,227
Speaker 1: It was yeah.

352
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:22,489
Speaker 0: So if you like pokémon And you like cute this is where it's at people.

353
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:34,615
Speaker 1: But enough of all that because of course you're here to hear about the New York Anime Festival 2007 the first New York Anime Festival.

354
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:35,380
Speaker 1: we were guests there.

355
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Speaker 0: We were there all three days and do you want to cover this the chronological way or a different way?

356
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,649
Speaker 1: I think we should start on well.

357
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:43,680
Speaker 1: first, you know shout outs and highlights and then you know.

358
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,038
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the good parts of the con and then the bad parts of the con.

359
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:54,460
Speaker 1: I've noticed that we tend to be very critical about conventions even ones We love like Otakon and Katsucon my favorite two cons.

360
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,620
Speaker 0: I think that's because when you go to something like a convention, it's right, right it no matter how many good things happen.

361
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:03,069
Speaker 0: What can you really say about the good things?

362
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:09,737
Speaker 0: Like for example, let's pretend that I go to Convention Y. Convention Y is an amazing game room and amazing showings.

363
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:10,360
Speaker 0: What am I gonna say?

364
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,070
Speaker 0: There was an amazing game room.

365
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,400
Speaker 0: There were amazing showings.

366
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,140
Speaker 1: Chirp chirp chirp not necessarily you could go into detail.

367
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:25,060
Speaker 1: I think the real problem is that I mean I think back to my first Otakon and I cannot think of a single bad thing that happened at it.

368
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,103
Speaker 1: Everything was awesome.

369
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:27,689
Speaker 0: I can think of some bad things.

370
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,980
Speaker 1: No because anything bad that happened ended up being an awesome story.

371
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:32,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of.

372
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,357
Speaker 1: but now I've been to.

373
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:37,613
Speaker 1: you know A bunch of Otakons like five or six or seven of them by six.

374
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:43,536
Speaker 1: I forget it doesn't matter old man I can't remember and They kind of all blur together and I can't remember what like.

375
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:46,568
Speaker 1: I have to think Alright, that was the Otakon with Laraku right?

376
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,414
Speaker 1: So who was there?

377
00:22:48,474 --> 00:22:49,176
Speaker 1: was this guy there?

378
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:50,260
Speaker 1: Did we go what hotel?

379
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,404
Speaker 1: I just can't remember.

380
00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:52,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're totally a blur to me.

381
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:55,244
Speaker 0: I don't remember which one was which I can't imagine.

382
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:59,018
Speaker 1: what that guy who wears his armor made out of con badges feels like.

383
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,826
Speaker 0: no God that guy with a beard.

384
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:02,071
Speaker 1: I know that guy's kind of awesome.

385
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:03,035
Speaker 0: We should talk to that guy.

386
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:04,220
Speaker 1: We should interview him.

387
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:05,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

388
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:08,820
Speaker 1: So highlights of the con number one.

389
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:24,036
Speaker 1: We ran, you know four panels at this con three of which were absolutely awesome and I think The best moment of this con for me hands down was you know We ran our anime match game like we run at every con and it pretty much always plays out.

390
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:24,297
Speaker 1: run

391
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:25,220
Speaker 0: at every con recently

392
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:29,660
Speaker 1: Yeah to a standing room only crowd and you know yelling and screaming and cheering and yeah

393
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:37,720
Speaker 0: I'm always surprised because it seemed I get the feeling right that people, you know Anyone who goes the anime match game will love it if they're at an anime con.

394
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,980
Speaker 0: That's a guarantee, but I get the feeling that a lot of people don't really understand the anime match game until they've gone to it.

395
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,713
Speaker 0: So I'm always amazed that people show up to it right off the bat.

396
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,058
Speaker 0: Like they know beforehand.

397
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:48,740
Speaker 0: It's gonna be good.

398
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,094
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, you know when most people don't even know how the match game works I have noticed that pretty much throughout con history.

399
00:23:55,175 --> 00:24:05,439
Speaker 1: if you see of Any sort of game show especially where there's any hint that the audience might be able to participate It's gonna be standing room only at a big con because people just they love that stuff

400
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,969
Speaker 0: Yep, especially if it's not competing with anything,

401
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:10,800
Speaker 1: but uh, you know, we always get celebrity guests.

402
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:18,706
Speaker 1: I think the best guest we've ever had until recently and I think I'll always be Steve Bennett because the Stevie B Is like the match game king.

403
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:21,434
Speaker 0: Well the best he's the best guest at match game.

404
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:25,128
Speaker 0: Well, hence the match game king Yes, I'm not gonna say is the best guess period.

405
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:32,160
Speaker 1: the guests we had were in no particular order except I'm saving the best for last Jamie McGonigal who's pretty damn awesome.

406
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:38,321
Speaker 0: I didn't know who he was at all And he was like the first guest that we saw there and he was pretty cool and he was very good at playing the match Game.

407
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:42,177
Speaker 0: Rachel Lillis equally awesome also excellent at playing the match game.

408
00:24:42,237 --> 00:24:45,889
Speaker 1: Lisa Ortiz Who was a personal hero of mine for a long time.

409
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,795
Speaker 0: also excellent at playing the match game.

410
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:53,220
Speaker 0: She was hilarious and yeah I think she was the best at on the panel at playing the match game.

411
00:24:53,521 --> 00:25:00,886
Speaker 1: Well also just the fact that she was she voice actually acted in a lot of anime that have a lot of very big dub Nostalgia for me.

412
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:01,751
Speaker 1: I mean slayers.

413
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:02,555
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:25:02,998 --> 00:25:06,286
Speaker 1: Yep and Veronica Taylor also awesome.

415
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:07,752
Speaker 1: She was pretty much right up there.

416
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:16,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, she was okay at the match game, but Corinne or and Peter Fernandez I know they were gonna be at the con Right, and I think they were on our.

417
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:17,772
Speaker 0: they we were.

418
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,660
Speaker 0: they were on a list that was emailed to us, right?

419
00:25:19,825 --> 00:25:27,088
Speaker 0: Yes And I was kind of worried before the con because if you don't know these are like the original American voices of like speed racer and tricks.

420
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:34,184
Speaker 1: you see Corinne or also voice acted in star blazers galaxy Rangers Ultraman.

421
00:25:34,224 --> 00:25:39,944
Speaker 0: these are these are awesome old people from way back and Like all man's.

422
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:47,666
Speaker 0: but I was worried because while these people are awesome and the triple awesome and I knew that beforehand On a match game.

423
00:25:47,686 --> 00:25:48,850
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

424
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,144
Speaker 0: It's like Peter Fernandez amazing, dude What does he know?

425
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:56,215
Speaker 0: he's not watching name the hottest boy in anime.

426
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,600
Speaker 0: if you ask him to he'll be like.

427
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:04,119
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is what first I mean I still I. it's like oh you're gonna be on my match game.

428
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:07,119
Speaker 1: Wow I kind of just want to shake your hand and get your autograph.

429
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:13,920
Speaker 1: yeah, I could do that the autographs but They were both awesome Corinne or was just hilarious.

430
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:26,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Peter Fernandez has one of the sexiest voices I have ever heard a human being give out in person like Riley on the radio is kind of sexy, but Peter Fernandez in person god damn.

431
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:32,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like you hear these radio guys and they sound like radio guys You know on the microphone or whatever.

432
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:42,360
Speaker 0: But Peter Fernandez like I saw this old man kind of walk in and I'm like, oh man, it's the old man Oh man's the awesome old man, and I didn't hear him say anything.

433
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:45,431
Speaker 0: And then when he finally said something I was like, holy shit cuz.

434
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:50,800
Speaker 0: he sounded like an amazing radio guy But he was just sitting right there and it was kind of crazy.

435
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:53,388
Speaker 0: It was like a voice coming out of a thing.

436
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,237
Speaker 0: You didn't expect I expected like an old voice, but it wasn't.

437
00:26:56,257 --> 00:27:00,551
Speaker 0: it was like a. Who's that guy who does the rockin New Year's Eve Dick Clark?

438
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:02,457
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah kind of like that.

439
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,626
Speaker 0: It was like whoa Plus wonder.

440
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,099
Speaker 0: he was voice acting and such.

441
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:11,320
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure how he would like being on the match game, but he seemed to love it and the crowd just loved it.

442
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though you know him and Corinne were weren't so good at match game mostly because they didn't know about anime.

443
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:24,060
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is they didn't know about modern animus Say like the name a character in Naruto who's better than Naruto.

444
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:34,046
Speaker 1: but at the same time they were able fairly consistently to wow the crowd with various answers that They did a pretty awesome job.

445
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:37,800
Speaker 0: They did the best job they could with their knowledge and it was still quite awesome.

446
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:40,455
Speaker 0: And yeah, it was a good match game.

447
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,159
Speaker 0: What can I say?

448
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,370
Speaker 1: I think we're pretty much gonna run the match game at any con.

449
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,780
Speaker 0: we go to keep running the match game until stops working.

450
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,410
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is right about when it stops working.

451
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:51,257
Speaker 1: we have challenger on fire coming up.

452
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:51,800
Speaker 1: now we've rework.

453
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,206
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's gonna work.

454
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:56,500
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna work great, especially with what we've got lined up for katsu con.

455
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,407
Speaker 1: Yeah we'll see we were gonna have.

456
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:03,672
Speaker 1: we're going to have guests who are fully aware of exactly what it takes to be a challenger on fire.

457
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:05,038
Speaker 0: that can help a lot.

458
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:09,210
Speaker 1: and Also, we've got fanboy feud still in the works.

459
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:10,475
Speaker 1: We have a bounty about that.

460
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:11,580
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that next week.

461
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,391
Speaker 1: Okay, but another highlight.

462
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:16,740
Speaker 1: we write, you know, that was the anime match game.

463
00:28:17,202 --> 00:28:19,552
Speaker 1: Now we ran the video game match game on Sunday.

464
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:25,000
Speaker 1: I would consider that probably The second or third lamest panel we've ever run.

465
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,795
Speaker 0: Well, I think I realized my mistake too late in running the video game.

466
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:38,769
Speaker 1: and you see Saturday I pretty much ran the anime match game and wrecked my voice as a result because there were two microphones between like a people Gaga, everybody was gaga.

467
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:42,324
Speaker 1: We didn't even give the Contestants microphones.

468
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,636
Speaker 1: they had to yell, but I had to yell a lot and I was shot.

469
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:46,860
Speaker 1: so I'm like Scott.

470
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,131
Speaker 1: Do you think you can run the video game match game without written material?

471
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:52,580
Speaker 1: and he says immortal words?

472
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,933
Speaker 1: Yeah rim I can make up stuff for a video game match game.

473
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:57,480
Speaker 1: How hard could it be in advance?

474
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,292
Speaker 0: I actually did make up a bunch of stuff in my head But then when it actually came time to use it, it was all gone.

475
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:04,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of late.

476
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,205
Speaker 0: You know how that happens.

477
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,410
Speaker 0: Everyone's had that experience.

478
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,800
Speaker 0: We didn't line up really should have written some of it down.

479
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:10,479
Speaker 1: We didn't really line up guests for it.

480
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,420
Speaker 1: So and and a bunch of our friends decided not to come to the con on Sunday.

481
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,685
Speaker 0: And honestly, I almost didn't - I can't blame them They made a wise choice and we'll get to that.

482
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:28,580
Speaker 1: but as a result, it was pretty much Scott myself Darryl Surratt and Dave Riley and Darryl Surratt and Dave Riley.

483
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,240
Speaker 0: We had to like pester them on Saturday in order to get them to come on Sunday.

484
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,380
Speaker 1: I had to bribe them with badges to katsu-kan.

485
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:43,869
Speaker 1: It was like all you have to do is be in this room Relatively sober around 11 a.m And I will give you a free badge to katsu-kan.

486
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:54,540
Speaker 0: and no matter what else we may say about them in the show or in The future they came through for us because the video game match game I mean, it was pretty bad, but if they didn't show up, it would have been non-existent.

487
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:55,323
Speaker 1: You know what?

488
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:57,812
Speaker 0: It was was much better because they were there.

489
00:29:57,952 --> 00:29:59,257
Speaker 1: what it was was something.

490
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,129
Speaker 0: Uh Okay, basically this how it went down right?

491
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:09,200
Speaker 0: First of all, there wasn't so much attendance Which is understandable considering it was Sunday and the attendance was low in general, which we'll talk about again.

492
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:10,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is weird.

493
00:30:10,346 --> 00:30:18,488
Speaker 1: I mean you know Saturday all our panels were like two of our panels were standing room only just about and One of them was like mostly a full room in this game.

494
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,572
Speaker 1: There was nothing.

495
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:20,014
Speaker 1: Yep.

496
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,660
Speaker 1: It was all our friends and fans.

497
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:22,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, bored people.

498
00:30:23,187 --> 00:30:28,769
Speaker 0: So very few people showed up understandably and Which really doesn't work for a game show.

499
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,460
Speaker 0: then only four people wanted to be contestants.

500
00:30:32,104 --> 00:30:39,700
Speaker 0: So we got two of them up there and because there were only four of us I had to host the show and be on the panel at the same time or else it wouldn't have really worked at all.

501
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,380
Speaker 1: Now, uh, how'd you come up with flavor text on the fly?

502
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:46,680
Speaker 0: I had flavor text made up in advance for like three questions.

503
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,474
Speaker 0: Then it flew out of my mind and I never wrote it down because I was moron.

504
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:59,020
Speaker 0: Yeah But I think my mistake in running the video game match game and the reason it didn't go I mean it could have gone better given our circumstances.

505
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:01,920
Speaker 0: It also could have gone worse very very easily.

506
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,300
Speaker 0: But I think the reason it didn't go as well as it I mean it couldn't real given the circumstances.

507
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:10,140
Speaker 0: It could have gone better than it did but it couldn't have gone great.

508
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,060
Speaker 0: That was pretty much out of the realm of possibility.

509
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:13,969
Speaker 0: But I think it could have been better.

510
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:34,189
Speaker 0: and the one mistake I made was this When I came up with questions and I guess since I just sort of came up with them Naturally and not really thinking too hard about them because I was pressed for time Was that I came up with questions in wit or or things to match where my answer had some sort of agenda attached to it as Opposed to coming up with matches.

511
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:36,540
Speaker 0: That would be humorous or entertaining.

512
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:42,357
Speaker 1: There's a reason Scott why when I wrote the match game originally way back.

513
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,239
Speaker 1: I I spent days and days and days like thinking about what could match what the da?

514
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:49,890
Speaker 1: Could I coach the guests for this?

515
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:59,808
Speaker 1: Well people know that anime And I and today I've refined it and refined it and refined it and now I have a database that I'm working on of all The possible match game questions.

516
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:02,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still think the problem is a lot of our match game questions.

517
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:08,860
Speaker 0: Don't have these sort of like, you know it blank in the middle of the sentence innuendo that the original TV match game head.

518
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:22,454
Speaker 1: Well at the same time you you have the instead the anime con innuendo, which yeah I mean, you know my favorite question to ask in any match game is always who is the sexiest man in anime because There's always the creepy answer.

519
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:28,356
Speaker 1: I mean Someone who shall not be named gave Oh Tori Akio as the answer to that question.

520
00:32:28,376 --> 00:32:31,245
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, that was bad.

521
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:34,854
Speaker 1: But also someone gave the answer Peter Fernandez.

522
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:36,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is kind of true.

523
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:47,020
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, yeah, I think that the key is if we ever do another video game match game I'm definitely I can come up with a lot of questions because I came up with a bunch in it.

524
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,655
Speaker 0: You're gonna write them down and none of them are gonna have agendas.

525
00:32:51,675 --> 00:33:01,712
Speaker 0: they're all gonna be entertaining answers Like I thought of one today while I realized the mistake, you know, you could do something like, you know Which video game character you're most attracted to and my aunt?

526
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:05,285
Speaker 0: Well, my answer would have been either What would your answer be?

527
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:09,379
Speaker 0: I don't know what video game character you're most attracted to.

528
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:21,036
Speaker 0: Luigi I think it's a tie for me between a Goombella and Scott with the goombas and what's-her-name?

529
00:33:21,177 --> 00:33:21,920
Speaker 0: who vomit?

530
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:25,705
Speaker 1: Right, I have a feeling.

531
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:31,510
Speaker 1: what'll happen is you'll read the game the questions that I'm going to generate from my database and give to You before the show.

532
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:32,158
Speaker 0: we'll see.

533
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:43,700
Speaker 1: Regardless while it was kind of mad and we're up there and the crowd was the crowd went with it But I forget what question it was, but Dave Riley was sitting next to me and he'd always like we'd show each other answers.

534
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,439
Speaker 1: So, uh One question came up and Dave didn't show me what his answer was.

535
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:57,267
Speaker 1: So I'm sitting there and you know I give my answer and goes to him and he kind of pauses for a minute and he holds his thing up and the crowd Looks at it and they're like, huh?

536
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:05,280
Speaker 1: And he says sick Semper and before you can say tyrannous my brain is thinking I've never heard of that.

537
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:09,639
Speaker 1: Wait a minute and right about that is when the clown pistol went off.

538
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:14,513
Speaker 0: I don't know where the hell Dave Riley a resident of now I guess New York got a clown pistol from.

539
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,408
Speaker 0: he must have bought it in Pennsylvania and drove it up with him or something.

540
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:20,139
Speaker 1: maybe the ninja consultants because I heard they had a stockpile.

541
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:23,159
Speaker 0: Oh, did they get a stockpile when they were down in the Atlanta or something?

542
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,117
Speaker 0: Cuz we knew that Daryl Surratt didn't have one because they're all primed us all.

543
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:29,100
Speaker 1: Friday and Saturday.

544
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:32,471
Speaker 1: He talked about how the clown pistol thing is dead.

545
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,679
Speaker 1: cuz you got to be subtle and no one can expect it.

546
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,447
Speaker 0: Well, everything he was saying was true.

547
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:36,789
Speaker 0: Is that?

548
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,159
Speaker 0: I think it anime we can Atlanta, right?

549
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:45,920
Speaker 0: I think the ninja consultants and some other people Attempted to clown pistol him and they did it in a non surprising and unsubtle way.

550
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,320
Speaker 0: Daryl basically said when I open this door something crazy is gonna happen.

551
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,120
Speaker 0: He opened it up and there was like a submachine.

552
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:53,145
Speaker 1: That's the brilliance.

553
00:34:53,386 --> 00:35:02,400
Speaker 1: by telling that story to us and then referencing it again later He planted in our mind the the subtle unconscious idea that there's no danger of clown.

554
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:09,368
Speaker 0: No, that was his story did not in any way Change my expectation of clown pistol II at all.

555
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:21,488
Speaker 0: my expectation of clown pistol ing was at zero because I Thought that the only way a clown pistol could be transported to this to this Convention would be by Daryl Surratt who lives in Florida.

556
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:28,367
Speaker 0: were available Surratt and that the TSA would prevent him from actually Successfully transporting one of these things.

557
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:31,900
Speaker 1: see but I knew that there were stockpiles of clown pistols in the area.

558
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:32,749
Speaker 0: I did not know.

559
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:37,740
Speaker 0: I was under the assumption There's no way to get a clown pistol up here short of driving from Florida.

560
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,780
Speaker 1: However, Daryl very either ingeniously or by accident basically put me completely at ease.

561
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:53,235
Speaker 1: I was like a deer and I finally decided it was safe to drink and then 6-cent for Toronto's and Dave Riley shot me with a clown pistol in the face at the New York Anime Festival.

562
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:53,657
Speaker 0: Yep.

563
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:56,610
Speaker 0: I Don't know what's gonna come of this clown pistol ing.

564
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,680
Speaker 0: I feel there has to be some sort of Grand finale of clown pistol ing at some point.

565
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,613
Speaker 0: But I'm not exactly sure how it can go down because it's it's you know Pete.

566
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:07,620
Speaker 0: now everyone is always looking out for it.

567
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,970
Speaker 0: I mean from now on I'm never going to assume that.

568
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:21,540
Speaker 0: pretty much I'm going to assume that if there is a convention and Either Dave Joel Daryl Gerald anyone any one of our anime podcast people is there even one of them?

569
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,502
Speaker 0: Even if it's me alone at the convention, I'm going to assume I have a clown pistol Myself.

570
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:34,107
Speaker 0: right that is how it's gonna be and I'm gonna be on the lookout for it at all times and I'm pretty much Locked in and impossible to surprise.

571
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:38,280
Speaker 0: So I'm really wondering how are we gonna top this?

572
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:38,841
Speaker 0: We got it.

573
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:40,225
Speaker 0: How's it gonna go down?

574
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:44,920
Speaker 0: and I have one idea, but I don't know how the idea will play out in the long run.

575
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,562
Speaker 0: It's going to be.

576
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:47,168
Speaker 0: it'll take such.

577
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:48,654
Speaker 0: it's such a high production value.

578
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:51,540
Speaker 0: I think it's in the realm of impossibility anyway.

579
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:53,760
Speaker 1: Other highlights from the con.

580
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:08,580
Speaker 1: I got to give some shout outs here because out of the blue like at the last second a non from Apple geeks and I'd open fallen and Conrad from c-squared Just decided hey, we're driving out to beacon and coming to the New York Anime Festival

581
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:11,795
Speaker 0: And that was good because without them there have been a much more boring.

582
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:13,000
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

583
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,506
Speaker 1: They just randomly came out.

584
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,272
Speaker 1: So we got to totally hang out with them.

585
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:18,320
Speaker 1: They spent time at our table chillin.

586
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:19,667
Speaker 1: We made fun of things.

587
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:25,411
Speaker 1: we forced someone to get their Portfolio reviewed by Tokyo pop and good times are had by all.

588
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,778
Speaker 0: it was quite the good times had by all.

589
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,188
Speaker 1: also We met a lot of our listeners at the con.

590
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:40,000
Speaker 1: I mean it was kind of surprising when he went our geek nights live podcast and First we asked how many people in the room know what a podcast is and everyone raises their hand just about.

591
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:43,633
Speaker 1: So then, you know I asked well, how many of you are geek nights listeners?

592
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:45,580
Speaker 1: and half the room raises their hand.

593
00:37:46,401 --> 00:37:48,899
Speaker 0: Wow, yeah, it was pretty crazy stuff right there.

594
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:54,140
Speaker 0: But yeah that that was a weird panel that we just kind of rambled on for an hour and then we were done.

595
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,139
Speaker 1: I think it was really good.

596
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,734
Speaker 1: I mean the crowd loved it did they cuz?

597
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:58,760
Speaker 0: I wasn't really looking at them.

598
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,592
Speaker 0: I was sort of just looking around like I do when I'm podcasting.

599
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:02,516
Speaker 1: see I cuz.

600
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:03,500
Speaker 1: I guess I do the same thing.

601
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,800
Speaker 1: I always did an anime club where you know I watched the crowd and all I'm doing is just the body language is the crowd and they're like during the gecky a panel.

602
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:14,592
Speaker 0: I was all watching the crowd because I was in my panel mode But when I was doing that panel I was in my podcast mode.

603
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:16,020
Speaker 1: see we're all laid-back.

604
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:17,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was cool.

605
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:23,020
Speaker 1: Very different modes, but also Particularly among the people we hung out with because you were all awesome.

606
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:30,194
Speaker 1: I can say with pretty good certainty that to date I have not met in person a listener of our show who was creepy.

607
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:31,740
Speaker 1: You guys are all cool.

608
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:43,400
Speaker 1: I think part of what our show does is it turns away the creepy people, you know, but There's a bunch of people from the SUNY purchase anime club and the generally SUNY purchase people out there.

609
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, check this story out, right?

610
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,354
Speaker 0: So the Corbin who's the the con chair of sitcom right which he invited us to?

611
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,939
Speaker 1: that was the first con that ever paid us To be guests, right?

612
00:38:52,620 --> 00:39:02,200
Speaker 0: so he I think was on a bus back from Otacon or something like that and he meets this girl and She's apparently like the co-president of the SUNY purchase anime club.

613
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:05,959
Speaker 0: What a coincidence, you know two anime club presidents sitting next to each other.

614
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:10,120
Speaker 0: I'm like a greyhound leaving the biggest anime convention on the East Coast, right?

615
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:18,360
Speaker 0: And he starts telling her all about the geek nights and she starts listening to the geek nights And then she loves the geek nights and she's crazy about it.

616
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:33,405
Speaker 0: And then she tells all her SUNY purchase anime club friends about the night's and then it also just so happens The SUNY purchase anime club from what I can tell from what these people have said is an awesome anime club Reminiscent of the RIT anime club only smaller in number and They do.

617
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:35,860
Speaker 0: they want us to go there to like, you know run some events.

618
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:41,940
Speaker 0: I'm totally all about that plus the only thing I the only reason I'm not just doing it right away is time and such.

619
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:43,839
Speaker 1: Well, we should just go out there for like a weekend.

620
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:45,107
Speaker 0: I don't know what we'll do.

621
00:39:45,147 --> 00:39:46,072
Speaker 0: We'll do something cuz.

622
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:54,820
Speaker 1: on one hand we have to work it out Yeah, but pretty much it seems like SUNY purchase has this very intense den of geekery much like RIT.

623
00:39:55,562 --> 00:40:04,087
Speaker 1: So, uh, if you're looking for a geeky school and you can't afford to go to RIT or you just don't live near Rochester You can just be on the other end of New York.

624
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:08,639
Speaker 1: totally check out SUNY purchase because everyone we have met from that school so Far has been awesome.

625
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:16,229
Speaker 0: Yeah And it sounds like they've got the comics and the video games and the board games the tabletop games and the anime and the whole Thing going on, but seriously, you guys are pretty damn cool.

626
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,630
Speaker 1: Yep.

627
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,220
Speaker 1: We even invited them to our New Year's party.

628
00:40:19,441 --> 00:40:21,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

629
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:24,398
Speaker 0: So let's see what what's going down to the convention that didn't involve us.

630
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:28,173
Speaker 0: All right, so I get there on Friday, right?

631
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:28,574
Speaker 0: Cuz it's.

632
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:34,715
Speaker 0: it's Friday Saturday Sunday and I'm hanging out before the con opens and I'm talking to the people's, you know, hey, what's up?

633
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:35,076
Speaker 0: What's up?

634
00:40:35,337 --> 00:40:41,970
Speaker 0: I meet my Peter Rios and Charleto from I guess respectively the comic geek speak podcast.

00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,696
Speaker 0: Yep indie spinner act podcast.

636
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:47,449
Speaker 1: when I told them that Finally finally after all this time.

637
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:52,777
Speaker 1: I read Frank Miller's Batman the Dark Knight Returns One of them shook my hands like about freaking time.

638
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,811
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so, you know, I'm talking to them.

639
00:40:55,831 --> 00:41:00,680
Speaker 0: I'm showing them around cuz they're mostly comic guys You know and they came to this sort of like a one-day deal on a whim.

640
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:02,445
Speaker 0: So I'm showing them around.

641
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:08,201
Speaker 0: all the cool stuff like yeah this I told I explained the plot of DNA angel the Charleto and how it was.

642
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:23,080
Speaker 0: you know twin girls a and B and a dude who transforms into an evil art thief at night and He likes girl a but girl a likes the evil art thief He transforms into but the evil art thief Trent likes girl B who likes the kid before he transforms and he was like

643
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:25,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't explain to him Ranma.

644
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:34,939
Speaker 0: No, I didn't explain to them Ranma that would have been scary Yeah, but yeah, I showed them around, you know taught them about animes and stuff and about Kiyohiko Azumon whatever.

645
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:39,036
Speaker 0: and Then I'm talking to Luke our dealer friend because I always like my thing.

646
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:42,720
Speaker 0: now at conventions This right is like if you're a fan going to a convention, right?

647
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:52,420
Speaker 0: You only really see things from one angle, but when you go to a convention, especially a big thing like this There's so many perspectives and so many different experiences.

648
00:41:52,440 --> 00:42:05,837
Speaker 0: I mean, there's the experience of the staff the experience of the volunteer the experience of the chair the experience of the fan The experience of the artists alley the dealer The professional like a TV guy running panels or promoting his company or whatever.

649
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:14,720
Speaker 0: this you know the the AV guys who run the panel rooms the the Teamsters and the janitors and the people work in the hotels and the people doing out the badges.

650
00:42:15,001 --> 00:42:18,300
Speaker 0: There's so many different people at a convention who have a totally different experience.

651
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:22,360
Speaker 0: So I try to go around and talk to all these people to see what it's like for all of them.

652
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:31,259
Speaker 0: So the situate the dealer situation at this con basically was this First he was complaining to me that hey, there's no one at this con and I'm like the con didn't open.

653
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:47,058
Speaker 0: yet He's like, oh and then he's like, you know because of the labor union at this the convention center Which is true for every convention center in order for him to get his stuff into the convention center through the loading dock He would have had to pay these guys to haul it in and we had to pay by the

654
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:47,400
Speaker 1: pound.

655
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:50,480
Speaker 1: It would have cost twice as much as his dealer table.

656
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,009
Speaker 0: His dealer table booth cost seven hundred dollars.

657
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,487
Speaker 0: to have those guys haul it in would have cost him $1,500 for the hauling.

658
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:07,519
Speaker 1: now the best part is an unnamed friend of ours works with you know A bunch of other dealers at the con and they were like, yeah It's gonna cost you X dollars to get all this stuff in.

659
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:17,080
Speaker 1: So then he immediately turns the people he works for and says I'll do it for why and why was still a lot of money But it was a lot less than what they wanted from the Javits.

660
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,364
Speaker 1: Yep, so he made a whole bunch of money and all he had to do was get some friends with cars and haul some stuff To the Javits.

661
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:25,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't go in the loading dock, but you can pull stuff.

662
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,540
Speaker 0: You can go park across the street from the Javits and bring it in the front door.

663
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:29,064
Speaker 0: They can't.

664
00:43:29,104 --> 00:43:31,260
Speaker 0: you know, that's the way those guys did it.

665
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,782
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

666
00:43:31,963 --> 00:43:36,340
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone must have paid the delivery, you know pride people with more stuff, but whatever.

667
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,547
Speaker 0: So that was that's the dealer perspective.

668
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:40,192
Speaker 0: also, you know the con.

669
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:51,136
Speaker 0: I realized this, you know before the con I had all sorts of speculation about what was gonna go down and I knew that the con was gonna be different from Other cons because the situation but didn't know exactly how this is.

670
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:58,619
Speaker 0: how it was different Because the con was in New York City in the Javits in December when it's cold when people are in school, etc.

671
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,303
Speaker 0: Etc.

672
00:43:59,544 --> 00:44:02,520
Speaker 0: And because New York is very expensive, especially during the holiday season.

673
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:06,677
Speaker 0: this is how it went down on Friday not so many people.

674
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:11,358
Speaker 0: on Saturday a crazy number of people and on Sunday not so many people.

675
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:25,419
Speaker 0: you see The reason for this is no one was gonna stay in the expensive hotels But because it was in New York in an incredibly central location with a lot of fans around and it was a big con with Lots of promotion and the world cosplay some and all this stuff.

676
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:36,170
Speaker 0: You did get a shit ton of Saturday only badges a shit ton and I think I heard numbers like 15,000 plus peoples But I know it's between 10,000 and 15,000. something is more accurate.

677
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:36,531
Speaker 0: Who knows?

678
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:39,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a lot of people and it was actually mighty crowded.

679
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,168
Speaker 0: Yep, especially on Saturday was mighty crowded.

680
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:43,914
Speaker 0: Friday and Sunday kind of crowded.

681
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:49,310
Speaker 0: the other thing with this con I noticed that I didn't realize until well into the convention is the con.

682
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,097
Speaker 0: hours were Friday 10 a.m.

683
00:44:52,137 --> 00:44:55,585
Speaker 0: To like 5 7 p.m Saturday 10 a.m.

684
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:56,348
Speaker 0: To 7 p.m.

685
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:58,016
Speaker 0: And Sunday like 10 a.m.

686
00:44:58,036 --> 00:44:58,318
Speaker 0: To 5 p.m.

687
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,402
Speaker 0: Now 5 p.m.

688
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,752
Speaker 0: Is usually later than most cons go on Sunday.

689
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:03,378
Speaker 0: Most cons end at like 3 p.m.

690
00:45:03,478 --> 00:45:05,183
Speaker 0: Or 2 2 p.m.

691
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:08,197
Speaker 0: On Sunday, but this con was starting at 10 a.m.

692
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:09,000
Speaker 0: And ending at 7.

693
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,898
Speaker 0: I mean most cons are like at least anime cons like Friday crack ass of dawn till 2 a.m.

694
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:28,700
Speaker 0: Saturday crack ass of dawn till 2 a.m Well, the thing is I took on is 24/7 crack as a dawn because it's a hotel con I know totally different kind of con I know can't even compare them but I'm talking about like the hours were so short, right?

695
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:35,320
Speaker 0: That was another contributing factor to the one day passes rather than the you know, full weekend action.

696
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean the thing is it was run more like a trade show exhibition comic-con than it was a standard anime con.

697
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:47,900
Speaker 0: There was definitely I mean there was plenty for fans But there was definitely a lot more industry stuff there than there was at the usual.

698
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:50,614
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that a little bit because I have to say one thing.

699
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:57,640
Speaker 1: I Realize now the exact difference between a for-profit professional con and a fan-run con.

700
00:45:58,182 --> 00:45:59,506
Speaker 1: the staff as in like.

701
00:45:59,948 --> 00:46:11,859
Speaker 1: if I need some AV stuff or I'm gonna run a panel and I got to hook up my Marantz to the equipment or I got to record something or I have to do a PowerPoint or I need any sort of service or Support or I have a question.

702
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:15,149
Speaker 1: The staff were better than any convention.

703
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,594
Speaker 1: I've ever been to in my life.

704
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,260
Speaker 1: Good God if I needed anything.

705
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,571
Speaker 0: Well those AV people at least.

706
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:20,700
Speaker 1: well everyone else too.

707
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:32,540
Speaker 1: The only problem that in the entire con with the staff seemed to be that it was a little top-heavy and that the staff were Great, unless you needed a high-level decision to be made in which case there were there was a very small number of people who?

708
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,424
Speaker 1: Could make that decision.

709
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:33,785
Speaker 0: Yeah.

710
00:46:33,886 --> 00:46:46,840
Speaker 0: Also, I'm not sure if the because those AV guys they were quality They kept talking to us every time we ran something always checking in being Like 10 minutes and 5 minutes before the panel ended and signaled 10 minutes left 5 minutes left.

711
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:50,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, they hooked me up with everything I could have possibly asked for.

712
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure.

713
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:53,740
Speaker 0: that could just be that you know company or whichever.

714
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:56,980
Speaker 0: You know the the union of AV guys of the Javits are just high quality.

715
00:46:57,442 --> 00:47:05,500
Speaker 0: I think you know cuz you know who can say that if you hired a different company to do some of the other cons We've been to that there would be just as helpful, you know, but everyone else too.

716
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,268
Speaker 1: I mean I went to get my badge and it was professional.

717
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:09,331
Speaker 1: everything worked it.

718
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:12,680
Speaker 1: it just worked so differently from a fan convention.

719
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:15,891
Speaker 1: I mean there was no Ambiguity about what was gonna happen when?

720
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:17,340
Speaker 0: well that there is one thing though.

721
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:31,300
Speaker 0: The only thing that I personally had a problem with was you know while the staff were super helpful I often had a hard time finding a staff member and also it seemed like at least for us We were sort of left to our own means a lot, you know, it's like we showed up at the con.

722
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:38,780
Speaker 0: I got my badge right and I don't know if we were supposed to have guest badges, but we got a professional badge Which I guess which was like solid gold.

723
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:40,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, just as good.

724
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:44,626
Speaker 0: I guess I didn't really care but I saw people with guest badges and I'm like I'm supposed to be a guest.

725
00:47:44,646 --> 00:47:45,573
Speaker 0: Where did you get that?

726
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:46,660
Speaker 0: But regardless?

727
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,889
Speaker 0: Like no one told us anything.

728
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:52,780
Speaker 0: like I went down and there was an artist alley table with our name on it.

729
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:54,777
Speaker 0: So I sat at it and there was no check-in.

730
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:56,367
Speaker 0: No one told us.

731
00:47:56,588 --> 00:48:00,170
Speaker 0: Hey your panels at X your panels at Y. We just looked at the schedule.

732
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,720
Speaker 0: that again to our panels on our own.

733
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:06,580
Speaker 1: But then again, I have to say the con kind of self-organized and it just worked like everyone showed up.

734
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, they found their artist alley table.

735
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:10,476
Speaker 0: It did self-organize but there was very there was.

736
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:18,547
Speaker 0: no it was like I didn't need direction from the staff But occasionally I was like looking for it, you know sort of like for a confirmation Like am I doing it right?

737
00:48:18,788 --> 00:48:19,732
Speaker 0: and it wasn't there.

738
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:20,656
Speaker 1: I didn't even feel that.

739
00:48:20,757 --> 00:48:23,580
Speaker 1: I just thought wow Everyone seems to know what they're doing.

740
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:31,660
Speaker 1: I didn't see any problems and while I didn't see staffers wandering around at the same time There was almost never a point where I thought there should be a staffer.

741
00:48:31,861 --> 00:48:33,310
Speaker 1: I mean the crowd kept moving.

742
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:34,820
Speaker 1: there were never problems anywhere.

743
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:35,262
Speaker 1: You didn't?

744
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:39,980
Speaker 1: it's like if the con had happened with zero staff other than security at the front.

745
00:48:40,181 --> 00:48:41,670
Speaker 1: I don't think anything would have been different.

746
00:48:41,912 --> 00:48:42,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

747
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:43,260
Speaker 0: it was very strange.

748
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:47,016
Speaker 0: I just everything seemed to sort of go on its own and like.

749
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:51,114
Speaker 0: I was looking for like Facilitators and they weren't there but it didn't really matter things.

750
00:48:51,134 --> 00:48:52,480
Speaker 1: just I thought that was kind of cool.

751
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,600
Speaker 1: Also in terms of panels there was none of that BS rescheduling that happens at a lot of fan conventions.

752
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,089
Speaker 0: well, I heard that some things were canceled, but there was no rescheduling.

753
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:06,996
Speaker 0: at least we had four panels one Friday two Saturday one Sunday and Everything just kind of worked out.

754
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:09,388
Speaker 0: They were happened at the right times.

755
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:10,492
Speaker 0: Nothing rescheduled.

756
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:11,636
Speaker 0: Nothing canceled.

757
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:12,520
Speaker 0: Nothing got in the way.

758
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:16,039
Speaker 0: People got out of the room when we told them to whose it just kind of worked.

759
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,848
Speaker 0: Alright, what else are you guys saying?

760
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:19,331
Speaker 1: Yeah.

761
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:20,758
Speaker 1: Well, I mean we had our artist alley table.

762
00:49:20,778 --> 00:49:21,120
Speaker 1: That was fun.

763
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,068
Speaker 1: We met a lot of awesome people.

764
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:30,780
Speaker 1: I'm sure a lot of you're listening now, but one person in particular We met this young girl who was cosplaying as a perfect Yotsuba.

765
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,388
Speaker 0: Perfect as he can be it was perfect.

766
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,417
Speaker 1: now now not just cuz you know, she dressed up like yo.

767
00:49:35,457 --> 00:49:36,604
Speaker 0: head was less around I think.

768
00:49:36,806 --> 00:49:42,694
Speaker 1: well, yeah When I say a perfect Yotsuba, I mean she effectively was Yotsuba.

769
00:49:42,715 --> 00:49:44,160
Speaker 1: She acted like Yotsuba.

770
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:51,956
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I may be a little bit older than Yotsuba like Yotsuba when she's grown up and her dad Was one of those awesome geeky dads.

771
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:55,053
Speaker 1: and you know I'm asking her cuz she's really cute and she's showing us like.

772
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:58,874
Speaker 1: these are all the Sketches I've gotten from artists and you know, she's like.

773
00:49:58,894 --> 00:49:59,920
Speaker 1: she really wants to show it to us.

774
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,134
Speaker 1: I'm flipping through it and she got some pretty high caliber artists to draw sketches for.

775
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:08,004
Speaker 0: I mean if your dad's taking these comic cons That's gonna happen.

776
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's kind of hard to avoid.

777
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:18,610
Speaker 0: She's talking about the last San Diego comic-con She went to and they've been to every mocha talking about how she got her friends into Yotsuba and how her friends got her into something else.

778
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:25,530
Speaker 0: and It's like a little girl who's living the geek lifestyle starts admonishing her dad for being a closet geek.

779
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:30,450
Speaker 1: And then he's explaining to us cuz cuz you know, she has this tough dragon with her and it's also green.

780
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,321
Speaker 1: I think she likes green things and dragon things

781
00:50:32,582 --> 00:50:33,045
Speaker 0: perhaps

782
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:43,264
Speaker 1: but you know She's really smart and really she's talking to us and I I had to talk down less to her that I've had to talk to Let's say a lot of people I've worked with in the course of my life.

783
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:52,410
Speaker 1: Oh but The coolest thing was that her dad was like, yeah, I'm trying to get her to Dungeons & Dragons and I'm halfway there.

784
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:54,600
Speaker 1: I just got to work on those dungeons.

785
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:56,650
Speaker 0: You gotta get some Bezum action going on.

786
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:11,638
Speaker 1: But then you go in enough kind of wander back over and we see them from a distance and We know that they have seen this cute girl dressed up as goats about because they stop and they're like, wow Oh my god, she's so cute.

787
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,810
Speaker 0: So I can't really just could not contain herself.

788
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:23,885
Speaker 0: So I point out to this girl and then I facilitated that inability to contain as much as I could sort of point out like You know overloading the containment unit if you will, you know, you've.

789
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:25,250
Speaker 1: you've got that great book of sketches.

790
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:29,370
Speaker 1: Well, there's two pretty famous artists right over there walking toward the table.

791
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:29,871
Speaker 1: It's now.

792
00:51:29,891 --> 00:51:36,390
Speaker 1: they couldn't escape the spotlight and she ended up drawing a sketch of Yotsuba in her book and it was very high quality.

793
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:37,615
Speaker 0: Oh super high quality.

794
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:39,281
Speaker 1: The girl is even like you don't have to ink it.

795
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:40,044
Speaker 1: She's like, it's too late.

796
00:51:40,104 --> 00:51:40,867
Speaker 1: I already started.

797
00:51:40,887 --> 00:51:47,057
Speaker 0: Oh god What else cool happened at this convention.

798
00:51:47,097 --> 00:51:50,648
Speaker 0: it was basically it wasn't some amazing life-changing convention.

799
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:54,370
Speaker 0: in all honesty I wish we would have gone just Saturday and not Friday or Sunday.

800
00:51:54,692 --> 00:51:56,061
Speaker 1: Well part of that was just cuz I didn't know.

801
00:51:56,121 --> 00:51:59,567
Speaker 1: if I had a hotel room in the city I would have been much happier staying the whole weekend.

802
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:00,549
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, of course.

803
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:06,937
Speaker 0: But since we didn't I would have been much happier doing just Saturday and I think most people Realized that and did Saturday only.

804
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:08,984
Speaker 0: and if this is a one-day con it might have been.

805
00:52:09,065 --> 00:52:11,915
Speaker 0: it would have been a super amazing Double triple awesome con.

806
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:12,899
Speaker 0: but it was.

807
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:14,143
Speaker 0: it was just a normal con.

808
00:52:14,203 --> 00:52:16,050
Speaker 0: Nothing incredibly bad happened.

809
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:21,690
Speaker 1: That was like I would say that the con was overall if you got every con is overall positive experience.

810
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,360
Speaker 1: I'd say it was above average even it was.

811
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:24,910
Speaker 1: it was like solid con.

812
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:31,791
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean also I point out there were a lot of people there just from who we talked to and asking and it for those People.

813
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:40,219
Speaker 1: it was their first anime con ever and I guess totally just making up this number, but I would guess that a good Third to half of the people there.

814
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:41,627
Speaker 1: It was their first anime con.

815
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:50,330
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, definitely I mean being in New York, you know being what it was Having a lot of marketing, you know outside outside of the internet.

816
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:59,290
Speaker 0: I know this is the kind of con that would attract a lot of people who had never been to a con before and It totally worked and there were plenty of people there just never been to a con.

817
00:52:59,612 --> 00:53:05,433
Speaker 1: I mean if anything I would say that the only Problems the con had at all and I find this inter one There was no water.

818
00:53:05,634 --> 00:53:11,730
Speaker 1: every fan con ever has pretty much infinite free water everywhere And they every panel room has a water cooler.

819
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:15,924
Speaker 0: There's water coolers just around as water coolers in all the special rooms.

820
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,670
Speaker 1: I was dying a thirst at this con.

821
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:20,750
Speaker 0: Yep, I had to keep going to the water fountain filling my Nalgene.

822
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,397
Speaker 0: I gotta bring my Nalgene back to work tomorrow.

823
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:31,229
Speaker 1: I keep forgetting but yeah, and the only other thing and it's not really a problem I just find it interesting, but I guess it's kind of obvious in the end, but no con feedback session panel.

824
00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:34,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were a lot of things that are just sort of like staples.

825
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:35,510
Speaker 0: no dance.

826
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:39,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were things that are staples of the typical fan convention.

827
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,210
Speaker 0: that just didn't happen at this.

828
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,095
Speaker 0: Maybe you know.

829
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:47,584
Speaker 1: no dance because it ends at 7 p.m Granted I'll admit that I didn't miss the dance because Katsucon is the only con I've ever enjoyed.

830
00:53:48,006 --> 00:53:56,610
Speaker 0: at least in the last several years I've enjoyed a con dance at yeah, but regardless, you know There were things that sort of be our default like you expect them to happen at a con.

831
00:53:56,731 --> 00:54:03,570
Speaker 0: They didn't happen here and I don't know if that's just a result of it being you know An industry con pro con or what?

832
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:06,742
Speaker 0: It's it's hard to tell like what differences were because of what.

833
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:15,689
Speaker 0: or maybe they were just differences Because they felt like it or they didn't think about it or who knows No way to know because they're not that far on the inside of this thing.

834
00:54:16,472 --> 00:54:19,664
Speaker 0: But that that's how it was and I guess it didn't.

835
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:23,869
Speaker 0: it's hard to tell how it would have affected it If it was different, but I guess didn't matter.

836
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:27,583
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think it was a success.

837
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:29,190
Speaker 1: I imagine they'll have it next year.

838
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:32,341
Speaker 1: I'm sure we'll find out, you know statistics and press stuff.

839
00:54:32,381 --> 00:54:34,750
Speaker 1: I didn't bother to try and find it out ahead of time.

840
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,849
Speaker 1: I'm sure they'll just release a press release and we'll talk about it.

841
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:42,770
Speaker 1: But if it happens again, I can say that we'll definitely do shows there if they'll have us back.

842
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm definitely thinking we'll do a Saturday.

843
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:55,263
Speaker 0: only though Yeah if it happens at least the same time of year because I definitely think the time of year really contributed is I could do a Friday Saturday because Friday started out slow, but I really picked up by the end.

844
00:54:55,364 --> 00:54:57,210
Speaker 0: I could do a Friday Saturday possibly.

845
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,782
Speaker 1: I think the thing is I couldn't do Sunday.

846
00:54:59,024 --> 00:54:59,809
Speaker 1: That was just too much.
