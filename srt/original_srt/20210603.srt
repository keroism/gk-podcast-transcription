1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,429
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, June 3rd, 2021.

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:09,730
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:13,040
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,424
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:18,440
Speaker 0: Tonight we're talking about skin, the flesh that wraps your meat.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,838
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,880
Speaker 0: So, uh, way, way back, like years ago, there was a recall on kitty fire extinguishers, like this one kind of fire extinguisher.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,420
Speaker 0: Like, I remember all of us were, like, checking our fire extinguishers.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,414
Speaker 1: Is that the brand I have?

10
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:33,719
Speaker 1: Hold on.

11
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:38,277
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was the brand you had because I remember we all were like, oh, shit, do I have the one?

12
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,040
Speaker 0: Like, is it a problem?

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:46,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, what happened to me was I went and filled out a form because I thought mine was recalled.

14
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:50,637
Speaker 1: And then, like, they were like, no, actually, yours isn't recalled.

15
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:51,260
Speaker 1: Yours is fine.

16
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:53,279
Speaker 1: And then one day one just showed up in my house.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,521
Speaker 0: Yep.

18
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:58,880
Speaker 0: So I made a note to go check on my fire extinguisher.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,620
Speaker 0: I didn't care that much because even like fail recall fire extinguishers often work mostly fine and they're rare to use.

20
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:10,520
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember I also told them when I got the second one, I'm like, do both of these work?

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,887
Speaker 1: I'm like, can I trust both of these?

22
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:12,349
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

23
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:14,179
Speaker 1: They're like, yes, you have two good fire extinguishers.

24
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,700
Speaker 0: So I was, you know, we're clean.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,780
Speaker 0: And now that it's like COVID is getting better, it's spring, we're getting rid of all our furniture and like changing a bunch of stuff up, doing a lot of cleaning, giving a lot of things away.

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,040
Speaker 0: And I bumped into the fire extinguishers and I was like, oh, I should probably actually check to see if these were recalled.

27
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:34,080
Speaker 0: So I go and I go through their somewhat tedious process.

28
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:38,020
Speaker 0: And sure enough, the one I have is specifically recalled.

29
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:39,249
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

30
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:45,840
Speaker 0: So they have a form to fill out and I fill it out and like a week goes by and they get back and I hear nothing.

31
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,110
Speaker 0: I don't hear anything.

32
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:47,575
Speaker 0: No response.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,859
Speaker 1: A fire extinguisher will probably just show up at your door.

34
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:56,739
Speaker 0: Ah, so yesterday a package, the size and shape of a fire extinguisher did in fact show up.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,883
Speaker 1: Nice.

36
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:58,919
Speaker 1: I thought that would happen.

37
00:01:59,381 --> 00:01:59,782
Speaker 0: Yeah.

38
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:07,320
Speaker 0: So I come up and first on the outside of it is a big packing slip and it has ridiculous and annoying instructions.

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,400
Speaker 0: It will be a giant hassle to mail the failed one that was recalled back to them.

40
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,259
Speaker 0: Like I'm going to have to call a special number.

41
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:15,600
Speaker 0: They have all these warnings.

42
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,779
Speaker 1: I didn't mail one back because I had two good ones.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

44
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:27,740
Speaker 0: So they want me to mail this back and they're like, here's a FedEx return number and a label, but you can't just give it to FedEx.

45
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:36,100
Speaker 0: You have to call this number first, ignore all their prompts and keep saying request to speak to an agent until a human being is on the phone.

46
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,520
Speaker 0: Then say these things in this order to get them to do a special thing.

47
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,979
Speaker 0: It's like this ridiculous bullshit that they sent me.

48
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:45,255
Speaker 0: So I think...

49
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,900
Speaker 1: Can't you do it in person at a FedEx store or something?

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,751
Speaker 0: No, you have to call a special number.

51
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:51,040
Speaker 0: that's just for this recall.

52
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaker 0: Because shipping a fire extinguisher is a pressurized vessel which has a lot of federal and state laws.

53
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:01,019
Speaker 1: Of course, yeah.

54
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:03,600
Speaker 0: So that's going to be a pain in the ass.

55
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:15,060
Speaker 1: What if you could you I mean, since it is defective in some way, couldn't you just unload it somewhere?

56
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:21,740
Speaker 0: I mean, I could, but they have instructed me not to do that because if I've used it, then there's no point and the recall doesn't matter.

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,900
Speaker 0: They're not going to send me a new one.

58
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,800
Speaker 1: Well, then it won't be unpressurized.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,660
Speaker 1: You could mail it back.

60
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,514
Speaker 1: You just need to send it back to prove that it was...

61
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:30,780
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,839
Speaker 0: So anyway, that's not why I brought this up.

63
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,940
Speaker 0: That annoying process, I read this sheet.

64
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:35,620
Speaker 0: It was stupid.

65
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,940
Speaker 0: I'm going to scan it, like post it online and make fun of it because it's just awful.

66
00:03:40,284 --> 00:03:44,440
Speaker 0: But then later I actually opened the package to like, look at this new fire extinguisher.

67
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:49,480
Speaker 0: And I find that the fire extinguisher in that box had exploded at some point during transit.

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,564
Speaker 1: Whoa.

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,100
Speaker 0: It was full of plastic debris and fire extinguisher bullshit that I had to clean up.

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Speaker 0: It was a giant mess.

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,600
Speaker 0: So it's currently sitting on the balcony.

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,480
Speaker 1: All that rigmarole to send one and they couldn't even send it properly.

73
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:02,859
Speaker 0: Yep.

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,720
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a whole nother page of instructions of how to pack it in the special way.

75
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,879
Speaker 0: So it won't blow up when I send it back to them.

76
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,079
Speaker 1: Well, I guess they didn't do that, did they?

77
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:11,540
Speaker 0: No.

78
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:16,959
Speaker 0: So I opened a service ticket now and I was like, look, this thing came up, exploded.

79
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,360
Speaker 0: I am not going to mail this back to you.

80
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,999
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm going to throw it away because I have all these pictures of it.

81
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:23,479
Speaker 0: What do you want me to do?

82
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:24,999
Speaker 0: And it's been radio silence.

83
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,520
Speaker 1: They're probably figuring it out.

84
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:27,833
Speaker 1: Yeah.

85
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,500
Speaker 0: It's annoying.

86
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:39,480
Speaker 0: And I currently, if there's a fire in this apartment, I'm going to use this apparently recalled, but might just work fire extinguisher.

87
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:42,800
Speaker 1: I mean, similar news last year.

88
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,640
Speaker 1: I bought a new bike helmet.

89
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:44,910
Speaker 1: Right.

90
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,140
Speaker 1: That was like the best possible bike helmet.

91
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:48,440
Speaker 1: Right.

92
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,700
Speaker 1: Number one safety rating, whatever.

93
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,031
Speaker 1: Right.

94
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:59,060
Speaker 1: And you would instead of adjusting it with the thing in the back, you adjust it with a knob on the top, which might interest you.

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,340
Speaker 1: Because, you know, because most of the bike helmets have a thing in the back, right?

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,699
Speaker 1: But because this one's on the top, apparently it's good for people with long hair because it doesn't have to fit.

97
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:12,059
Speaker 0: I just got a brand new helmet not that long ago.

98
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,820
Speaker 1: Well, five years from now, you can get the same helmet I have.

99
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,340
Speaker 0: I upgraded to MIPS.

100
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:18,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too.

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,079
Speaker 1: So anyway, the the spinny thing on top, though.

102
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:21,700
Speaker 1: Right.

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,559
Speaker 1: So I only used the helmet last year and like twice this year so far.

104
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:31,140
Speaker 1: You would spin it to tighten the thing and then sometimes or basically frequently.

105
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,680
Speaker 1: It like it wouldn't stay like you would spin it and then it would be like fully spin all the way back.

106
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,200
Speaker 1: Almost like, you know, in a vacuum cleaner, you push the button and it sucks the cord in like a rice cooker does the same.

107
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:47,840
Speaker 0: It sounds like it's cheap, like the gear in there, the little like it was a very expensive top rated helmet.

108
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,079
Speaker 1: So I was like, what the fuck is it?

109
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:52,000
Speaker 1: So I go online.

110
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,879
Speaker 1: I finally am like fed up with it enough.

111
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:56,220
Speaker 1: And the warranty was two or three years.

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,619
Speaker 1: So it wasn't out of warranty yet.

113
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:01,740
Speaker 1: So, you know, after I rode one time, one or two times this year, I was fed up enough.

114
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,079
Speaker 1: I emailed them and I looked on YouTube to see like, hey, is it supposed to be like this?

115
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:11,180
Speaker 1: And it's like, no, people are like, it's so stiff that like I sometimes I can't even get out of it.

116
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,819
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, it is clearly broken.

117
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:17,000
Speaker 1: So I email them and just like you radio silence.

118
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:19,699
Speaker 1: And I was getting like, I spent a lot on this helmet.

119
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:20,297
Speaker 1: I'm mad.

120
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Speaker 1: But no, then I just waited a couple more days and they sent an email and they sent me and I got a new helmet.

121
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:26,880
Speaker 1: Right.

122
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,560
Speaker 1: And the new one is perfect in every way.

123
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,640
Speaker 1: And it totally works and is completely different and is the best.

124
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:42,840
Speaker 1: But to basically instead of mailing the old helmet back, they made me cut the straps on the old one and send them a photo to prove.

125
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:50,200
Speaker 1: And that felt really bad to do to a helmet that could probably be repaired if you just replaced like a tiny piece of plastic in there somewhere.

126
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,760
Speaker 0: You could have photoshopped it and then given the helmet away to someone.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,799
Speaker 1: I thought about that.

128
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,820
Speaker 1: There was nothing wrong with the helmet part of it.

129
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,780
Speaker 1: It was just something wrong with the tension mechanism.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,580
Speaker 1: It's like you could definitely have fixed this.

131
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,180
Speaker 1: It's a very expensive helmet.

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,280
Speaker 1: You're making me just cut the straps and throw out.

133
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,599
Speaker 1: Well, I cut the straps and threw it out.

134
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:09,700
Speaker 0: So, yeah, anyway, got any news?

135
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:10,440
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

136
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,260
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

137
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:12,194
Speaker 0: We can talk about anything.

138
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:13,780
Speaker 1: I don't have any news.

139
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,819
Speaker 1: I got a Geek Byte, though.

140
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:24,119
Speaker 1: I was on Netflix and Netflix was like, "Yo, I got a recommendation engine and I 80 plus percent think that you, Scott, should watch

141
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:24,340
Speaker 1: this.".

142
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,180
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Well, I got nothing doing right now.

143
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,799
Speaker 1: What am I going to do?

144
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,529
Speaker 1: Read the book club

145
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:28,712
Speaker 1: book?".

146
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,300
Speaker 1: I got 90 minutes, right?

147
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:33,039
Speaker 1: Nothing's happening.

148
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,660
Speaker 1: There's no hockey on anymore these days.

149
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,139
Speaker 1: It's shorter than a hockey game, right?

150
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,760
Speaker 1: It's a Netflix original thing.

151
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,559
Speaker 1: I want to get my money's worth out of this Netflix.

152
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:44,319
Speaker 1: And it was a French sci-fi movie called Oxygen.

153
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:48,900
Speaker 1: And so I'm like, "All right, whatever.

154
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:50,898
Speaker 1: No one's talked about this.

155
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,477
Speaker 1: I guess I'll be the person who finds

156
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:53,739
Speaker 1: out.".

157
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:54,900
Speaker 1: It was very recent.

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,740
Speaker 1: It came out like May.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,618
Speaker 0: Direct release on Netflix, May 12th.

160
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very recent.

161
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:02,000
Speaker 1: It's just a movie.

162
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:03,440
Speaker 1: So what's the deal with this movie?

163
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:04,259
Speaker 1: Here's the premise.

164
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,180
Speaker 1: It's sci-fi deal, right?

165
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:13,860
Speaker 1: This person wakes up in a cryosleep chamber, right?

166
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,640
Speaker 1: Presumably they were sick, right?

167
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:24,120
Speaker 1: And then used cryogenics to preserve their body until there was some sort of future where they could be healed, right?

168
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,820
Speaker 1: The typical scenario, right?

169
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,439
Speaker 1: You presume.

170
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:29,538
Speaker 1: And they have woken up.

171
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:32,840
Speaker 1: Clearly not the right time, right?

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Speaker 1: They weren't woken up intentionally.

173
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:35,818
Speaker 1: They were accidentally woken up.

174
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,900
Speaker 1: And the cryo chamber that they are in is very futuristic, right?

175
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,719
Speaker 1: It's got AI, it's got all kinds of shit going on.

176
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:43,960
Speaker 1: It's very fancy.

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,319
Speaker 1: Very, very fancy.

178
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:51,240
Speaker 1: Could not exist in our world, but is realistic for the future kind of thing, right?

179
00:08:53,161 --> 00:09:03,380
Speaker 1: And then basically what you get is something that would... The content of it is obviously very different from something.

180
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,838
Speaker 1: What's the one where the military guy who can't... Was it Born on the 4th of July, right?

181
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,558
Speaker 1: Is that the one?

182
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,239
Speaker 0: Johnny Get Your Gun is probably what you're talking about.

183
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,459
Speaker 1: Johnny Get Your Gun.

184
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:18,579
Speaker 1: Johnny Got His Gun?

185
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,338
Speaker 0: Yes, Johnny Got His Gun.

186
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,218
Speaker 0: That's the one you're thinking of.

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,780
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the one I read in high school.

188
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,380
Speaker 1: Johnny Got His Gun, where the guy is in war and he gets shelled, right?

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,076
Speaker 1: He can't talk.

190
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:33,999
Speaker 0: There was the well-known Metallica song that is loosely based on this story.

191
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:38,160
Speaker 1: Yes, we watched the Metallica video in school.

192
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:40,960
Speaker 1: It's a lot like that.

193
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,900
Speaker 0: That entire album just flooded into my brain out of nowhere.

194
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,731
Speaker 0: I haven't thought about "And Justice for All" in like 20 years.

195
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:49,940
Speaker 1: So it's a lot like that, right?

196
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:57,660
Speaker 1: Where the whole thing is just from the perspective there's one person and there's one place and there's a world outside that they're interacting with, right?

197
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:11,899
Speaker 1: But the camera really doesn't leave this trial sleep chamber except to show you the past or the future or things like that, right?

198
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,539
Speaker 1: Memories, dreams, that sort of thing.

199
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,687
Speaker 1: And basically what it is, it's like a Twilight Zone episode, right?

200
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,577
Speaker 1: Or a sci-fi short story.

201
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:22,418
Speaker 0: I'm into that.

202
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,496
Speaker 1: They reveal what's going on in stages.

203
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,639
Speaker 1: Until you find the terrible secret of space.

204
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:32,447
Speaker 1: And then it's over.

205
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:33,437
Speaker 1: It's 90 minutes.

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:41,380
Speaker 1: I feel like it's not like it's paced slowly or anything, that I feel like 90 minutes is too long.

207
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,918
Speaker 1: I just feel like you could have told the same story with less plot points, right?

208
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,720
Speaker 1: In a shorter amount.

209
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:53,119
Speaker 1: It's sort of like if you took Harrison and Bergeron, how long is that story?

210
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,609
Speaker 1: 20 pages?

211
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,739
Speaker 1: It's really short, right?

212
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,100
Speaker 1: You don't have to read Harrison and Bergeron.

213
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,779
Speaker 1: But how long is the movie?

214
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:06,309
Speaker 0: Oh god, that movie, I recall it being extra long but I don't remember if that's just because I watched it on the sci-fi channel with commercials the first time.

215
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,692
Speaker 1: Right.

216
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:09,479
Speaker 1: Let's see how long the Harrison and Bergeron movie is.

217
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,207
Speaker 1: 99 minutes, right?

218
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,000
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's about similar length, right?

219
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:22,758
Speaker 1: They take this tiny short story that says everything that has to be said in a very small number of pages and they stretch it out to a 90 minute movie.

220
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:24,133
Speaker 1: So that's what this is.

221
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:31,365
Speaker 1: It's like if you wrote this as a short story in like, you know, some little anthology sci-fi magazine it would be a short one and it would be pretty good.

222
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:34,495
Speaker 1: Or it would be one Twilight Zone episode, right?

223
00:11:34,536 --> 00:11:35,849
Speaker 1: You could cover all this material.

224
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:39,940
Speaker 1: But they stretch it out to 90 minutes by adding more stuff to it, right?

225
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:45,506
Speaker 1: But if you like that sort of thing then you could find a worse way to spend your 90 minutes.

226
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:48,378
Speaker 1: And if you don't like that sort of thing don't watch this sort of thing.

227
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:50,840
Speaker 0: I'm a mob game.

228
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:52,680
Speaker 0: That kind of sci-fi is up my alley.

229
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,132
Speaker 0: I similarly watched a movie.

230
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,586
Speaker 1: It's in French with the English subtitle or whatever subtitle you have.

231
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:01,910
Speaker 0: So I ended up similarly this past weekend watching a film that I had never heard of.

232
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,707
Speaker 0: It stars Ed Harris.

233
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:04,334
Speaker 0: It was made in the 80s.

234
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,178
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is.

235
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:09,992
Speaker 0: Well, I guess he didn't watch Westworld so he wouldn't stand out to you there either.

236
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:21,967
Speaker 0: But anyway, this movie is super weird in that it's hard to really explain it unless you know the history of the antebellum South in America.

237
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:30,253
Speaker 0: But basically before the American Civil War there was this concept of filibuster, which is not the filibuster you're thinking of.

238
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:32,239
Speaker 0: It's an older different use of the word.

239
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,073
Speaker 0: But the gist of it was pro-slavery.

240
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:56,735
Speaker 0: white folk in the US would with the tacit blessing of American conservative politicians go down to Mexico and Central America and try to foster revolutions and form republics that they could then apply back to the US for statehood to then add more slave states to the union.

241
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,705
Speaker 0: They wanted to basically make a bunch more texases.

242
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:12,519
Speaker 1: Well, there were many revolutions in places south of the US that were incited by the US or indirectly, but none of them became states.

243
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this movie is fascinating because it opens and it's like it's framed as a true story.

244
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:20,066
Speaker 0: and it is true.

245
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:26,490
Speaker 0: The guy it's about, Walker, existed and did basically all the things that this character does in the movie.

246
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:36,188
Speaker 0: He went down to Mexico, tried to do this, failed, got to say like escape back to the US, went on trial for violating the neutrality of a foreign power.

247
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:42,840
Speaker 0: The juries nullified because the juries always nullified anyone who filibustered back then because they were pro-slavery.

248
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:44,999
Speaker 0: So he got away with it.

249
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:54,860
Speaker 0: He went back this time to Nicaragua funded by Cornelius Vanderbilt personally to take over the country, which he did.

250
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,837
Speaker 0: He became the president of Nicaragua for multiple years.

251
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:07,726
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, I basically, if that's true, I mean, I didn't know it clearly because I don't know any Nicaragua, anything about Nicaragua older than the 80s, 1980s.

252
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:13,909
Speaker 0: So he did this and he was kind of crazy and it's a heart of darkness.

253
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:22,315
Speaker 0: situation basically happened and eventually a coalition of a bunch of Central American armies led by Costa Rica deposed him.

254
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:26,560
Speaker 0: They sent him to Honduras where he was executed and his execution was right.

255
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,379
Speaker 0: This dude needed to be executed.

256
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,239
Speaker 0: But the movie is framed as a true story and it tells this story.

257
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,497
Speaker 0: But it has a bunch of anachronisms in it that creep in.

258
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:45,063
Speaker 0: Like it starts out like very historical and it gets more and more surreal and more and more surreal as it goes on.

259
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:50,159
Speaker 0: Like at one point, like you see someone reading Time magazine like just for a second and you're just like, wait, what?

260
00:14:50,780 --> 00:15:01,265
Speaker 0: And then like a car just drives by way out of place in the very 18 somethings up in the very 1855 car from the 19 whatever 1970s.

261
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:23,425
Speaker 0: So eventually, like I'm just spoil it at the very end of the movie a helicopter lands with a bunch of like CIA agents who evacuate all the US citizens and then the credits roll and it shows a bunch of shots and basically the movie was about the continued meddling that the United States was doing in that region and how nothing changed.

262
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,304
Speaker 0: and we've been doing the same thing this whole time.

263
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:26,619
Speaker 1: You don't say.

264
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,834
Speaker 0: But the movie was just that part I knew.

265
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:29,936
Speaker 1: Yeah.

266
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,547
Speaker 0: But the way the movie did it was surreal and interesting.

267
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,875
Speaker 0: It was not what I expected and I enjoyed it.

268
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:48,678
Speaker 0: But I don't know if I would necessarily recommend you watch it unless you're into sort of surrealist weird movies because it appears that the director was kind of blackballed from ever making movies again after this.

269
00:15:50,783 --> 00:16:05,060
Speaker 0: Partly because it was very Hollywood American government, but also because they went down to Nicaragua and filmed it there during the Contra situation partly in protest against the Contra situation to try to bring more dollars down there to help the people of Nicaragua.

270
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:13,839
Speaker 0: Like it was the whole thing you can read about and I had literally never heard of this movie before and it was fascinating to watch.

271
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:15,454
Speaker 1: Okay.

272
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,405
Speaker 0: In some little newses, so there's one little thing.

273
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:23,365
Speaker 0: Many of you have been working from home for possibly the last year or so.

274
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:39,459
Speaker 0: Scott and I are still working from home and the UK is thinking about having some regulations that would ban emails or the requirement of responses to emails and other types of communication outside of your paid working hours.

275
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,420
Speaker 0: Unless you're being paid that you don't legally would not have to respond to communications.

276
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:53,550
Speaker 1: I mean you know, I guess that only matters because they're probably not, they don't have the right to work situation that we have, right?

277
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,986
Speaker 1: You know, at least in New York state.

278
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,130
Speaker 0: Not right to work at will is what you're thinking of.

279
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:58,080
Speaker 0: At will.

280
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:00,180
Speaker 0: Right to work is the anti-union thing.

281
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,699
Speaker 0: At will is the nobody owes you anything thing.

282
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:16,542
Speaker 1: Right, so we have work at will in New York state and many other states in the US which means you can quit your job at any time for any reason which is perfectly, that's what it should be.

283
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,910
Speaker 1: You should be able to quit your job at any time for any reason, right?

284
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,519
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

285
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:27,310
Speaker 1: But also you can be fired at any time for any reason as long as you weren't fired for being, you know, something that's a protected class.

286
00:17:27,352 --> 00:17:31,392
Speaker 0: There's a list of reasons that are not allowed and as you can imagine it's very easy to manufacture.

287
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:33,611
Speaker 1: It's a short list that's too short.

288
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:34,300
Speaker 1: It should be longer.

289
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,380
Speaker 0: It is very easy to manufacture a reason.

290
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,169
Speaker 1: Yes, it is very easy to manufacture.

291
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,452
Speaker 1: one of those reasons and in fact the list is so short you know, it only includes like, you know, protected classes, right?

292
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,504
Speaker 1: Like you can't fire someone because they're a Jew like me, right?

293
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:49,534
Speaker 1: It's like okay, right?

294
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:55,374
Speaker 1: Well I'll, you know, you can, can you fire someone because they won't come to work late Friday, right?

295
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:59,333
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you might be able to get away with that maybe not, right?

296
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:08,564
Speaker 1: You know, because that, you know, but what thing you can do for example in New York at least, right, is like I'm a Mets fan, right?

297
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,866
Speaker 1: I could fire you for wearing a Yankees hat.

298
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:12,546
Speaker 1: That's totally legal.

299
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,040
Speaker 1: Nothing, no one, they have no case against me if I did that.

300
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:19,754
Speaker 1: I could be like nope, I'm the boss here.

301
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:21,426
Speaker 1: No Yankees allowed.

302
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:24,760
Speaker 1: That's not gonna be.

303
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:41,594
Speaker 0: Basically the way this would work is also, you know, the laws are different there obviously but it talks about things like routinely emailing or calling your employees, especially if you're a manager outside of working hours could arguably be grounds like that would be harassment if they were doing that.

304
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:44,908
Speaker 0: They would have to like not do it routinely or you could make a case.

305
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:49,492
Speaker 1: So not just, so not just you don't, you know, guarantee protection against being fired.

306
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,594
Speaker 1: if you don't, you know, respond to email.

307
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:55,599
Speaker 0: But doing it could be prima facie evidence of harassment or pressure.

308
00:18:57,367 --> 00:19:06,806
Speaker 0: And it's interesting because I think the quote in the article is they're looking for the government to give employees a legally binding right to disconnect outside of their working hours.

309
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:15,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you know, like I already, I guess I don't have this right, but basically I have the, we both have the privilege.

310
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:19,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, I act like I do, right?

311
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,100
Speaker 1: If I say work is done, work is done.

312
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,554
Speaker 1: I just stop looking at the email.

313
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:32,422
Speaker 0: What the fuck you know, if some, you know, like I've done, I've done a lot more work outside of hours than I would have in the past, but I'm getting paid enough to like, I'm, I'm pretty cool with it for the time being.

314
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:40,908
Speaker 1: So the, for, so for example, a couple of weeks ago at work, right, we have a new system for triaging incidents, which is good.

315
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:42,180
Speaker 1: That's a good thing to do, right?

316
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,474
Speaker 1: So there was a rubric that was like what, you know, there were like levels like level one through five, right?

317
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:52,483
Speaker 1: And it's like what what, you know, what does an incident have to do to qualify for the different levels, right?

318
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:55,780
Speaker 1: It's like something is something is causing problems.

319
00:19:56,382 --> 00:19:59,272
Speaker 1: Users can still get their work done, but it sucks, right?

320
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,998
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, that's like level three or four depending, right?

321
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,675
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, customers can't do work, right?

322
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,109
Speaker 1: We can't make money.

323
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,797
Speaker 1: That's like incident.

324
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,191
Speaker 1: That's like number one, right?

325
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,626
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, this makes sense.

326
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:14,239
Speaker 1: Now we can quantify how many incidents are happening at what level.

327
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:15,756
Speaker 1: we know how what to work on.

328
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:17,714
Speaker 1: first if there are incidents, right?

329
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:20,625
Speaker 1: All the very good, good stuff to do procedurally speaking.

330
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,780
Speaker 1: But next to each incident level, right?

331
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:27,190
Speaker 1: There was like, hey, what do we do about it, right?

332
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:35,012
Speaker 1: And the top incident level they had written next to it, you know, incident hot priority one, right?

333
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,475
Speaker 1: You're expected to work on this 24/7 until it's fixed.

334
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:40,578
Speaker 1: And I was like, no.

335
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:47,673
Speaker 1: I was like, I don't care if every single computer in the whole company is on fire and nothing's working, right?

336
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,572
Speaker 1: I'm like, I work this many out.

337
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,652
Speaker 1: I work this many hours, right?

338
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:55,369
Speaker 1: If it gets to five o'clock and the incident isn't fixed, that's tough shit.

339
00:20:55,389 --> 00:21:02,340
Speaker 1: You're going to have to if it's if it's Friday at three because it's summer Friday, you're waiting until Monday at nine or 10 before I get back to that.

340
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,178
Speaker 1: That's just tough cookies, right?

341
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,371
Speaker 1: I'm like, we don't.

342
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,014
Speaker 1: I don't work intentionally, right?

343
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:11,827
Speaker 1: Obviously, if I worked at a medical place, right?

344
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,265
Speaker 0: Aerospace, you know, there are very different kinds of jobs.

345
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:21,692
Speaker 0: Like, for example, my job was to be like the live producer for sports and like there's 10 overtimes.

346
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:24,034
Speaker 0: I got that's an expected part of my job.

347
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,347
Speaker 0: Like, I'll be there for those 10 hours.

348
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:29,513
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say, well, it's game seven of the Stanley Cup final and it went to overtime.

349
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:32,317
Speaker 1: It's NASA in NASA.

350
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,115
Speaker 1: And there's an Apollo 13 happening.

351
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:35,557
Speaker 1: You're not just like, well, five o'clock.

352
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:37,891
Speaker 1: You can't do right.

353
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:43,039
Speaker 1: But I intentionally purposely work in places that are not dire like that.

354
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

355
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,911
Speaker 0: I have places dire like that.

356
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,546
Speaker 0: And I've tried to get out of places like.

357
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,251
Speaker 0: I've tried to avoid that in my career as I've gotten older.

358
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:52,678
Speaker 1: I have purposefully not worked in such a place.

359
00:21:52,819 --> 00:22:03,261
Speaker 1: And I was like, look, from the perspective of the company, like internal to itself, I understand why you would be like level one incident that that's like an emergency, right, that you need to work on 24/7.

360
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,304
Speaker 1: But I'm like, I have a greater life.

361
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:08,699
Speaker 1: I'm looking at it from the perspective of, you know, life and society.

362
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:15,790
Speaker 1: I was like, if our company crumbles, right, it's like that's not actually that damaging to society.

363
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:19,997
Speaker 0: It's not that especially in this current job market for people like you and me.

364
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:21,465
Speaker 1: Right.

365
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:33,062
Speaker 1: And I was like, you know, and even that, it's like if our website, if our systems are down for a whole weekend, it's like we pay out people quarterly as long as we're up enough in the quarter, each quarter to get the payments out.

366
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:33,991
Speaker 1: It's like we're good.

367
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,800
Speaker 0: Everyone was dragging that penny arcade job posting.

368
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:43,510
Speaker 0: that was basically we won't pay you much and you're on call 24/7 and you can't take vacations for a web comic.

369
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:47,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, to keep a little to keep a JPEG serving.

370
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:50,212
Speaker 1: It's like, no, that's like.

371
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,819
Speaker 0: I think there is an amount of money.

372
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:54,173
Speaker 0: stop job like that.

373
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:58,276
Speaker 1: If the funny JPEG doesn't load, it can wait until Monday.

374
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:58,558
Speaker 1: Yeah.

375
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:05,526
Speaker 0: I imagine there's an amount of money you could pay me where I would be willing to say I will make sure that JPEG is up 24/7.

376
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:11,385
Speaker 0: But the problem is that is an amount of money to where after like a year I would quit because I could retire.

377
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,479
Speaker 1: That is an amount of money a 20 JPEG does not make.

378
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,480
Speaker 0: Exactly.

379
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:26,275
Speaker 0: And if the JPEG did make that much money, then the people involved in that JPEG should be making a lot more money, which means they could hire several people so that no one has to be on call that much.

380
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:26,659
Speaker 0: Yep.

381
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,272
Speaker 0: Anyway, one last thing.

382
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:41,644
Speaker 0: I'm going to preface this by saying that I am not speaking in my professional capacity at any job, nor am I giving you investment advice of any kind whatsoever, nor is Scott.

383
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:44,029
Speaker 1: I'll give you investment advice.

384
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:44,959
Speaker 1: Don't do coins.

385
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,470
Speaker 1: Don't touch a coin ever.

386
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,959
Speaker 1: Unless it's a legit real US coin.

387
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:51,058
Speaker 0: Or other countries coins.

388
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,624
Speaker 0: Stay away from anything smaller than a dime because they're really not worth touching.

389
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:58,615
Speaker 1: No crypto coins at all.

390
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:10,072
Speaker 0: So if you haven't noticed, AMC, the movie theater chain, like they were on the verge of bankruptcy and not doing well, not just because of covid, but there's a lot like theaters are not doing great generally, especially theater chains.

391
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:15,968
Speaker 0: So nerds on the Internet decided to just buy a lot of AMC stock.

392
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:21,140
Speaker 0: It's a meme stock, just like what happened with GameStop, what's happening with like various random crypto coins.

393
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,259
Speaker 0: Like it's a thing.

394
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:30,715
Speaker 1: I always remember in seventh grade, there was a little stock market game run by the local bank and our seventh grade teacher was like a big stock dude.

395
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:31,038
Speaker 1: Right.

396
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,059
Speaker 1: So we all the whole class broke up into teams and played the stock market game.

397
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:35,604
Speaker 1: Right.

398
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:36,956
Speaker 1: It was it was meant for schools.

399
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:37,360
Speaker 1: Right.

400
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:44,329
Speaker 1: And you fake invested a pile of money and whoever had the most money at the end of a period of time, you know, one and we got to go to the stock market.

401
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,794
Speaker 1: Right.

402
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:46,960
Speaker 1: The floor of the nice here, whatever.

403
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:51,824
Speaker 1: And we won because the teacher told us right in like week two.

404
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:52,591
Speaker 1: He's like.

405
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:53,217
Speaker 1: he's like.

406
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,218
Speaker 1: I found these Mexican penny stocks, guys.

407
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:56,365
Speaker 1: Right.

408
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,086
Speaker 1: We're all gonna and here's some news about the peso something.

409
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:00,733
Speaker 1: Right.

410
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,652
Speaker 1: Everyone buys much of these as you can.

411
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:07,278
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, well, and he's like, you can get so many shares if it goes up, even like a few cents, you'll win this.

412
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,138
Speaker 1: That is arguably possibly illegal.

413
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,200
Speaker 0: I'm not stating that in my professional opinion.

414
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:15,764
Speaker 1: Well, it was a game wasn't real money.

415
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:16,148
Speaker 0: Yeah.

416
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:19,200
Speaker 0: But if but if it was implied that you should do this for real.

417
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,035
Speaker 1: No, it was not.

418
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:21,784
Speaker 1: It was to do it.

419
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:24,229
Speaker 1: It was to win the stock market game with fake money.

420
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:33,964
Speaker 0: It was not to do it for I remember we did that on gig nights with the listener a long time ago and one player just bought one share of Berkshire Hathaway's back when it was like a very high value stock.

421
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:38,058
Speaker 1: I think I think I think the listener Timo won by buying all Apple and just waiting.

422
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,668
Speaker 1: I could have won.

423
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:43,772
Speaker 1: I bought Netflix and right before it they launched their Xbox app.

424
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:44,680
Speaker 1: It skyrocketed.

425
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:46,480
Speaker 1: And then I sold when I was in first.

426
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:48,257
Speaker 1: If I would have just hold it all, I would have won.

427
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,540
Speaker 1: So anyway, the point is this is similar.

428
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:52,982
Speaker 1: Right.

429
00:25:53,002 --> 00:25:54,904
Speaker 1: AMC is basically was in the pooper.

430
00:25:54,924 --> 00:25:55,651
Speaker 1: Right.

431
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,260
Speaker 1: And by illegally, that means anyone could buy a bunch of shares easily.

432
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,280
Speaker 1: These kids can't afford a Berkshire Hathaway share.

433
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,980
Speaker 0: But they can afford some really, really cheap almost bankrupt stock in a company that's not going anywhere.

434
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:10,067
Speaker 1: Exactly.

435
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:22,673
Speaker 1: So if enough kids and other fools and other easily I guess gullible people buy AMC, it'll go up and they can buy a lot of shares because it's cheap.

436
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:32,308
Speaker 0: So I think last I saw now, because of this, like massive Redditor retail investment in AMC, they're worth as much as like Delta Airlines.

437
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:33,581
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

438
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:34,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

439
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:37,998
Speaker 1: AMC probably could not even afford to buy one jet.

440
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:41,552
Speaker 1: So the weird news, I'm guessing.

441
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:49,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not giving you advice, but I hope you are prudent in your investments and seek the advice of a professional if you decide to do anything.

442
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:55,964
Speaker 0: So the news is that AMC is actually going to take advantage of this.

443
00:26:56,207 --> 00:27:06,916
Speaker 0: They're issuing 11 million new shares of their stock, which, if you don't know, when a company issues more stock, that basically dilutes the value of their existing stock in most cases.

444
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:09,665
Speaker 0: There's situations where that doesn't apply, but those don't apply here.

445
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:12,010
Speaker 0: So they're they owned.

446
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,047
Speaker 1: they own the whole company to start with.

447
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:14,289
Speaker 1: Right.

448
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:26,200
Speaker 0: Whoever started the founder of AMC did some sort of initial public offering to distribute shares to the world in exchange for money that they would ostensibly use to run their business or do some change to their business.

449
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,509
Speaker 1: But but in that IPO, they didn't give out 100 percent of the company to the to the IPO.

450
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,259
Speaker 1: They gave out some smaller percentage.

451
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:35,560
Speaker 0: Sometimes it could have been 100 percent dependent.

452
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:36,236
Speaker 0: You could have been.

453
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,746
Speaker 0: But I don't know anything about AMC's IPO at all.

454
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:39,559
Speaker 0: So don't quote me.

455
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:40,419
Speaker 1: I don't either.

456
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:40,984
Speaker 1: Right.

457
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:55,477
Speaker 1: But the point is, you know, issuing more means like they hold they held on to some of the stock where, you know, AMC itself or the the, you know, the the board or whoever, right, still owns some AMC and they're selling it.

458
00:27:56,703 --> 00:28:02,798
Speaker 0: Well, issuing more stock means you're making new shares that did not exist before and then selling them.

459
00:28:03,322 --> 00:28:03,524
Speaker 1: Right.

460
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:07,140
Speaker 1: But those shares come from some still ownership.

461
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,047
Speaker 1: You can't just be.

462
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,400
Speaker 0: No, but they're brand new ownership.

463
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:15,360
Speaker 0: If I if I say if I have 100 shares in Rimco and I give you 50, so I got 50, you got 50.

464
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,873
Speaker 0: We're 50 50, right?

465
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:21,298
Speaker 0: If I issue 100 more shares and give them to Emily, well, Emily now outranks both of us.

466
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,920
Speaker 0: I've diluted your share.

467
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,036
Speaker 1: Where did those 100 shares?

468
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,853
Speaker 1: I made them up.

469
00:28:25,422 --> 00:28:26,780
Speaker 0: I issued them from nothing.

470
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:28,791
Speaker 0: That's what it is.

471
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:33,280
Speaker 1: That's BS because I owned half the company.

472
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,500
Speaker 0: No, you owned a number of shares and I just closed the company.

473
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
Speaker 1: You can't just give away.

474
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,307
Speaker 0: That's that is literally how stocks work.

475
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,099
Speaker 1: Well, that's way bad.

476
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,259
Speaker 0: It's always been that way.

477
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,640
Speaker 1: You can't give your base.

478
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,024
Speaker 1: You're effectively giving away my debt.

479
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:52,379
Speaker 0: Usually when there's an issuance than stock prices, there's a lot of things that happen.

480
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,399
Speaker 0: This is like done with advance now.

481
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:57,175
Speaker 0: Like there's all sorts of things that happen that I don't want to try to explain.

482
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:02,617
Speaker 0: But so they issued a bunch more stock because these nerds are probably going to buy it.

483
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:04,839
Speaker 0: And the stock dropped a little bit.

484
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:12,455
Speaker 0: But apparently, according to this news, AMC raised five hundred eighty seven point four million dollars by selling this new stock they made.

485
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:13,960
Speaker 1: All right.

486
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,199
Speaker 1: Well, I guess that won't.

487
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:23,040
Speaker 0: But they issued a statement that I'm going to read this statement to you that I want you to translate this to human language.

488
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,940
Speaker 0: It's not long, but this is.

489
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:27,505
Speaker 0: this is the statement they made about this.

490
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:39,300
Speaker 0: issuance, quote, We believe that the recent volatility of our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business or macro or industry fundamentals.

491
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:40,718
Speaker 1: So honest.

492
00:29:41,121 --> 00:29:44,139
Speaker 0: And we do not know how long these dynamics will last.

493
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:59,380
Speaker 0: Under the circumstances, we the we here is AMC caution you against investing in our class a common stock unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.

494
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:00,473
Speaker 1: Wow.

495
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,658
Speaker 1: That is the most honest thing I've ever heard a company ever say.

496
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:04,737
Speaker 1: Right off it.

497
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,357
Speaker 1: Company in the United States.

498
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,110
Speaker 0: Imagine if I would have to Scott and I was like, look, I'm going to sell you.

499
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,482
Speaker 0: I'm going to tell you a counterfeit Gucci bag, pay full price for it.

500
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:15,940
Speaker 0: I'm telling you, it's counterfeit.

501
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:17,100
Speaker 0: It's worth nothing.

502
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:21,112
Speaker 0: And in fact, there's a bomb in it and it'll just explode an hour after you buy it.

503
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:24,535
Speaker 0: I need you to sign something saying that I disclose this to you.

504
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:30,528
Speaker 1: I think it's more like, you know, I don't even know how to describe what.

505
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,040
Speaker 1: But yeah, so that's a refreshing honesty of well, we are selling something.

506
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:37,598
Speaker 1: Do not buy it.

507
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:47,019
Speaker 1: There is somebody out there that we know who is such a fool who isn't listening to anyone and is just like, there's this enormous fool out there who's just throwing money away into the fire.

508
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:50,420
Speaker 1: We're going to go and catch the money they're throwing.

509
00:30:51,204 --> 00:30:52,559
Speaker 1: We can't convince them to stop.

510
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:53,779
Speaker 1: So we're just going to catch it.

511
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,256
Speaker 1: We might as well do not throw your money into the fire along with that nut job.

512
00:30:58,923 --> 00:30:59,125
Speaker 1: Right.

513
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,740
Speaker 1: We're just just watch us collect it and don't don't do anything.

514
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,599
Speaker 0: Oh, you said they said they said they're going to use the money they raised for, quote, general corporate purposes.

515
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,339
Speaker 1: Executive compensation.

516
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Speaker 0: Probably the speculation in this article is paying down their debt because they were flirting.

517
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,140
Speaker 1: Well, they have a debt.

518
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,780
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

519
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,957
Speaker 0: They were they were flirting with bankruptcy prior to all this nonsense, according to some news I've read.

520
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:29,486
Speaker 0: OK, well, so yeah, that's again, I am not giving you investment advice.

521
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:37,740
Speaker 0: The statement I have made are my personal opinions and not the opinions of any employer that I have, nor are they the official opinions of geek nights as an entity.

522
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:43,937
Speaker 1: They are the opinions of AMC, though the opinion of AMC is that you should not invest in them.

523
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:46,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, they just said that.

524
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:47,656
Speaker 1: AMC said that we didn't say it.

525
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:51,400
Speaker 0: I guess in case you wonder why I'm a communist.

526
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Speaker 0: but anyway, things of the day.

527
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:02,719
Speaker 0: So the show's about skin.

528
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,379
Speaker 0: We had this vague idea of having all skin news, all skin things of the day.

529
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,179
Speaker 0: But let me tell you, if you look for news about skin, you're going to find skin news there.

530
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:18,500
Speaker 0: 30 percent of that news is like pseudoscientific, like fake medicine nonsense.

531
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:20,351
Speaker 0: Yep.

532
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:22,199
Speaker 0: 33 percent of that news is just makeup stuff.

533
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:25,798
Speaker 0: And the remaining 33 percent are horrific violent crimes.

534
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:29,840
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, the makeup stuff could be news, but we don't know anything.

535
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,940
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about makeup.

536
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,520
Speaker 0: I'm not going to talk about something.

537
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:35,889
Speaker 1: Some of the makeup podcasts, though that shit is probably like their bread and butter.

538
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:36,278
Speaker 1: Yeah.

539
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,009
Speaker 0: So in the end, so I settled on.

540
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,295
Speaker 0: I just have a thing of the day.

541
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:50,118
Speaker 0: This company, these researchers, at least, have made a smartphone case that is made out of synthetic human skin that has sensors in it.

542
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,110
Speaker 0: So it can.

543
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:53,219
Speaker 0: it senses how you interact with it.

544
00:32:53,865 --> 00:33:00,036
Speaker 0: And it could be used as a creepy control device for your smartphone or a computer.

545
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:01,820
Speaker 1: Teledildonics.

546
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,494
Speaker 0: It can result.

547
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:06,705
Speaker 0: Teledildonics is a field that we haven't talked about recently at geeknights.

548
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:09,119
Speaker 0: And I feel like it's time has come again.

549
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,159
Speaker 0: I feel like we brought it up in a lot of packs, panels back in the day, and we haven't brought it up recently.

550
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:18,260
Speaker 1: I'm surprised you don't have peripheral for your VR face mask.

551
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:21,600
Speaker 0: They're out there, but that's not our it's not.

552
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,580
Speaker 1: I just said I'm surprised.

553
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,211
Speaker 1: I know they're out there.

554
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:24,218
Speaker 1: I'm saying why don't you have one?

555
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,894
Speaker 0: Because I do not yet have a significant use case for remote sex.

556
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:44,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you want to see video of people using one person made a touch pad out of it and stuck it on their Lenovo, it looks exactly like what you're imagining.

557
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:51,579
Speaker 0: It is capable of detecting a gentle caress or tickling or air as being separate from more firm touches.

558
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,299
Speaker 0: You can pinch it and manipulate it to make it do stuff.

559
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:57,798
Speaker 0: This is my thing of the day.

560
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,051
Speaker 1: OK.

561
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:03,400
Speaker 1: I don't use TikTok.

562
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:04,739
Speaker 1: You know, I don't trust it.

563
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:05,998
Speaker 1: I don't have the TikTok app.

564
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,320
Speaker 1: I don't have a TikTok account.

565
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:10,300
Speaker 1: But you can just do much like Twitter.

566
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,478
Speaker 1: You can just go to TikTok.com and watch funny TikToks.

567
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:15,339
Speaker 1: Most of the time I watch them when they're reposted to Twitter.

568
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:15,884
Speaker 0: Yep.

569
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,985
Speaker 1: But you can just go straight to TikTok.

570
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:19,016
Speaker 1: And I happened.

571
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:23,737
Speaker 1: I don't know how I found this, but I guess just by chance there is a TikTok account.

572
00:34:24,626 --> 00:34:25,380
Speaker 1: The derm doctor.

573
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:25,783
Speaker 1: Right.

574
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:26,237
Speaker 1: We got skin.

575
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,498
Speaker 1: Skin is back.

576
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:29,753
Speaker 1: This guy, Dr.

577
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:33,786
Speaker 1: Shaw, is a legit actual dermatologist, something that we are not.

578
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,157
Speaker 1: And he's got a TikTok account.

579
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:38,038
Speaker 1: And on the TikTok account, it's quite good.

580
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,539
Speaker 1: In fact, lots of legit real advice from an actual doctor who you can trust.

581
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,399
Speaker 1: Went to school for many years studying dermatology.

582
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:53,060
Speaker 1: Also, if you're the kind of person who likes the popping type videos.

583
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,160
Speaker 1: This adds an extra layer to that.

584
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:00,060
Speaker 1: It's not just the popping videos.

585
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,679
Speaker 1: It is the dermatologist reacting to them, telling you like what they are, what's happening.

586
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:05,480
Speaker 1: Right.

587
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,899
Speaker 1: Giving people, you know, scoring them out of 10, giving negative points and they're not wearing gloves, that sort of thing.

588
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:14,956
Speaker 1: So content warning, if you don't if you can't watch that sort of thing, you know.

589
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:18,751
Speaker 1: And yeah, it's just a really, really good channel.

590
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:21,340
Speaker 1: if you want, you know, dermatology info.

591
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:24,139
Speaker 1: And this is I don't see this.

592
00:35:24,281 --> 00:35:31,435
Speaker 1: I mean, it probably might be there somewhere, but this is the kind of content like I don't see this on Twitter or, you know, I think it's like a.

593
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:40,580
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure once I click on some of these between with all the Internet trackers, YouTube will start showing me dermatology things and then I'll see.

594
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:44,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's just a really, really good channel.

595
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:49,698
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I think I might have mentioned it on the show before, but here is the actual his actual link for you.

596
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:50,548
Speaker 0: All right.

597
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:58,420
Speaker 0: In the moment, the book club book, which now that I'm a good chunk of the way through Spider-Man 2099, I'm starting to read this again.

598
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,237
Speaker 0: The weather's nice.

599
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:02,256
Speaker 0: It'll be biking and I'll be outside today, though.

600
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm thunderstorms tonight, too.

601
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:17,806
Speaker 0: But I am confident we will do a book club book episode on the tale of Genji, not just our novel, the first novel by the end of July, like either the end of July or like the first week of August.

602
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:24,747
Speaker 0: I feel like we'll be able to do this show at the rate we're going unless, I don't know, something big gets in our way.

603
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,965
Speaker 1: You see, you know, the problem is, and, you know, enjoying too much summer is the only thing that gets in the way.

604
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,352
Speaker 0: You need that because I can't read a lot.

605
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:37,159
Speaker 0: if I do like a hundred mile bike ride because when I get home, I'm just going to fall asleep after I eat something.

606
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:48,772
Speaker 0: But if it's like a kind of day where like I bike to Randall's Island and then just lay in the sun for a while or we go to the beach, like if we if we could just go to the beach, I need like three beach days and I'll be done with this book.

607
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:49,979
Speaker 1: Maybe.

608
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,496
Speaker 0: Maybe four beach days because I might swim a lot.

609
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:53,640
Speaker 1: Sure.

610
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,924
Speaker 0: Otherwise, follow us in all the places.

611
00:36:56,106 --> 00:37:00,500
Speaker 0: Stay tuned for our likely PEX online, PEX East online panels.

612
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,680
Speaker 1: I'm still slowly but surely making progress and updating all of our website type stuff.

613
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:16,903
Speaker 1: Someone came to our discord where you should come and and recently was like, hey, you know, how come like in the RSS feed there's no like thing of the day links?

614
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:29,130
Speaker 1: Well, there has and effectively almost almost always has been an RSS feed for just things of the day, which is funny because I forgot I forgot and I literally like, Scott, that's a good idea.

615
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,720
Speaker 0: We should do it.

616
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,496
Speaker 0: And Scott's like, OK, I got good news.

617
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:33,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

618
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:39,300
Speaker 1: our existing website that I made so long ago already has a lot of functionality.

619
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:40,920
Speaker 1: you may not realize.

620
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:43,286
Speaker 1: we have.

621
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:56,880
Speaker 0: we have RSS feeds for every geek nights, every individual day of weeknights, just the book club, just the specials, just the experimental episodes, which we haven't done one of those anymore.

622
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:57,690
Speaker 0: You know what?

623
00:37:57,731 --> 00:37:57,997
Speaker 0: You know what?

624
00:37:58,018 --> 00:37:59,615
Speaker 0: The next episode is.

625
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,879
Speaker 0: that's going to be in that feed.

626
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:03,457
Speaker 0: It's going to be when we do a call in show, I think.

627
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:07,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, the website is old and kind of man and needs a lot of help.

628
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:11,364
Speaker 1: And when I redo it, it's going to have all this functionality and way more.

629
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:16,120
Speaker 0: But we even have a feed of a random selection of old episodes of geek nights.

630
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:17,283
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:38:17,323 --> 00:38:20,174
Speaker 1: So there is a surprising amount of useful.

632
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:22,757
Speaker 1: if you want to follow geek nights the way you want to follow it.

633
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:28,780
Speaker 1: You know, we're on almost every platform and our website has RSS feeds and other things.

634
00:38:29,102 --> 00:38:38,079
Speaker 0: And if there are ways you want to interact with us or with other geek nights, listeners or people in the geek nights community who do not listen to geek nights, which is a thing like that's fine.

635
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,740
Speaker 0: Let us know because we're designing these new experiences and websites.

636
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:43,999
Speaker 0: The more input we get from you.

637
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:49,317
Speaker 0: I'm not saying we'll do everything you ask for, but I'd like to at least know what you want while we're thinking about this.

638
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,170
Speaker 1: And a lot of this stuff already exists.

639
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:51,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

640
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,239
Speaker 0: So, yeah, let's get right into it.

641
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,439
Speaker 0: Skin, because if you can't tell, we're trying to come up with Thursday episodes.

642
00:38:58,862 --> 00:39:00,919
Speaker 0: They pull up the article on skin.

643
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:07,068
Speaker 1: So obviously, we're not dermatologists or experts in any way the way that the tick tock doctor.

644
00:39:07,088 --> 00:39:07,900
Speaker 0: We are not doctors.

645
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,437
Speaker 0: We're any advice we give you.

646
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:10,363
Speaker 1: Right.

647
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:19,629
Speaker 1: So obviously, if you have any sort of actual skin question or condition or anything, don't put 100 percent faith in whatever we say.

648
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:20,120
Speaker 1: Right.

649
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:21,197
Speaker 1: You should verify it.

650
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,440
Speaker 0: I said a little bit.

651
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:23,339
Speaker 0: Is this a boil?

652
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:24,685
Speaker 1: Right.

653
00:39:24,726 --> 00:39:24,989
Speaker 1: You should.

654
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:29,818
Speaker 1: Anything that we say, you should verify it against, you know, someone who can actually trust like a doctor.

655
00:39:30,283 --> 00:39:34,059
Speaker 1: If you have an actual condition, go to a doctor quickly, please.

656
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:34,562
Speaker 1: Right.

657
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:35,744
Speaker 1: You know, figure that shit out.

658
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,517
Speaker 1: Get, you know, if you can, I hope you can.

659
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:45,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do pay particular attention to aspects of my own skin because actually malignant melanoma runs in my on one side of my family.

660
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:57,104
Speaker 0: Like a lot of my relatives have had malignant melanoma tumors removed surgically, but it's not that big a deal because honestly, if it's caught early enough, like removing it is usually fine.

661
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:02,660
Speaker 0: Like none of them, despite all these tumors being removed, no one in my family has ever died of skin cancer.

662
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's like the number one thing you got to talk about.

663
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,540
Speaker 1: You were talking about skin, right?

664
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,127
Speaker 1: It's actually.

665
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:08,364
Speaker 1: it's an organ of your body.

666
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:11,425
Speaker 1: It's made of cells, just like the rest of your body is made of cells.

667
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:12,340
Speaker 1: Your blood's made of cells.

668
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,320
Speaker 1: Your bones are made of cells.

669
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,339
Speaker 1: Your brain is made of cells.

670
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:14,721
Speaker 1: Right.

671
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,624
Speaker 1: Your skin is made of cells also.

672
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:16,989
Speaker 1: It's just.

673
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:19,080
Speaker 1: it's an organ, just like your heart, your lung, whatever.

674
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:19,866
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:23,820
Speaker 0: And your skin is the is literally the most important part of your immune system.

676
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,660
Speaker 0: It is the thing that separates the inside of your body from the rest of the universe.

677
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:35,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're just a long tube filled with meat and there's a mucus membrane on the inside and there's skin on the outside.

678
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,564
Speaker 1: Yep.

679
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:40,999
Speaker 1: Skin, you know, if there's something wrong with your skin, it's your lung, you'd be like, oh, shit, and go to the doctor.

680
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:42,519
Speaker 1: Something's wrong with your skin.

681
00:40:42,661 --> 00:40:43,109
Speaker 1: Guess what?

682
00:40:43,414 --> 00:40:43,760
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

683
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,219
Speaker 1: Go get that taken care of.

684
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,427
Speaker 0: But at the same time, a lot of the things that could be wrong with skin are completely benign, but they can.

685
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:54,423
Speaker 0: they can be visible and they can be frightening if you don't know.

686
00:40:54,443 --> 00:41:02,343
Speaker 0: I feel like well, but every time I've gone to a doctor for a skin thing, the thing I'm fascinated by because I've been to doctors for a lot of different things.

687
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:05,378
Speaker 0: Dermatologists are the only doctors I've ever been to.

688
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:11,021
Speaker 0: where I come in, they look at me and within 10 seconds, they're like, oh, that's a blah, blah, blah, blah.

689
00:41:11,103 --> 00:41:12,259
Speaker 0: I know exactly what that is.

690
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:12,885
Speaker 0: Here's your.

691
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:13,760
Speaker 1: they have the luxury.

692
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,059
Speaker 1: They have the luxury of being able to see the fucking thing.

693
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:16,364
Speaker 1: Right.

694
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:19,480
Speaker 1: They don't got to do like an X-ray or an MRI or a guest.

695
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:19,642
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:22,780
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, doctor, I got a pain in my in my right hip.

697
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:24,103
Speaker 1: It's like a doctor looks at your hip.

698
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:24,838
Speaker 1: It looks like a help.

699
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:32,382
Speaker 0: I went to the doctor once because I had a headache for a month and there were and the first thing they said was, well, I don't want to alarm you, but that sounds like a brain tumor.

700
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:34,599
Speaker 0: We're doing an immediate MRI and CAT scan.

701
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:36,960
Speaker 0: It was not, in fact, a brain tumor.

702
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,200
Speaker 0: It was, in fact, Lyme disease.

703
00:41:38,821 --> 00:41:42,620
Speaker 0: But I went in once because I had a thing growing on my bottom, but like this.

704
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:45,659
Speaker 0: It was almost like a tumor just growing on my eyebrow.

705
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:47,740
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, God, cancer.

706
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:50,319
Speaker 0: I go to the doctor and they're like, oh, hit it with a book.

707
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,879
Speaker 0: No, no, it wasn't of Gideon's lump.

708
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:53,060
Speaker 0: That's not a skin thing.

709
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:54,746
Speaker 0: That's a different thing, which is still there.

710
00:41:54,766 --> 00:41:56,499
Speaker 0: You can see it kind of stick it out of my wrist.

711
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,080
Speaker 0: It's harmless.

712
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,087
Speaker 0: But so I go in and I'm like, oh, no, what are they going to do?

713
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:01,658
Speaker 0: Biopsy.

714
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,219
Speaker 0: They didn't even biopsy it.

715
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,117
Speaker 0: They looked at it and they're like, I thought they were just like investigating it.

716
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:09,339
Speaker 0: And then I feel a slight pinch.

717
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:15,332
Speaker 0: And then the doctor, she just like leans back and she's holding it and she says, well, I took care of that.

718
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:16,976
Speaker 0: I was like, what was it?

719
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:18,300
Speaker 0: Just like skin tab harmless.

720
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:20,440
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, OK, can do a biopsy.

721
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,096
Speaker 0: She's like, no.

722
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:26,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one time I went to an actual dermatologist, I had like a like a rash.

723
00:42:26,655 --> 00:42:26,860
Speaker 1: Right.

724
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,317
Speaker 1: And I couldn't get rid of it.

725
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,118
Speaker 1: And it didn't itch or anything, but it just wouldn't go away.

726
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:31,391
Speaker 0: Yeah.

727
00:42:32,164 --> 00:42:33,937
Speaker 1: The doctor, they walk in like two seconds.

728
00:42:34,423 --> 00:42:37,240
Speaker 1: They're like, that's what this is called is tinny of versicolor.

729
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:45,109
Speaker 0: I have I had a 10 years for sure that I was a brochure for it as a brochure for it and a subscription immediately.

730
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,566
Speaker 1: And then walks out and I'm like, what the hell did I wait in the waiting room for a five second meeting?

731
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:52,779
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, I had a reason by minor bout with versicolor.

732
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:56,559
Speaker 0: But actually, I did a telemedicine and they said, yeah, it's actually not that bad yet.

733
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:01,499
Speaker 0: So just they literally told me to just put my anti dandruff shampoo on that place.

734
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,531
Speaker 0: That's that's.

735
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,700
Speaker 1: the prescription they gave me was just cells and blue.

736
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,659
Speaker 1: That was double powered.

737
00:43:05,863 --> 00:43:06,026
Speaker 1: Yep.

738
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:06,679
Speaker 1: And all you got it.

739
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,759
Speaker 1: All I had to do is rub it on and just wait and not just wash it off immediately.

740
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, that took care of it.

741
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,020
Speaker 1: That made that made it go away super fast anyway.

742
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:16,300
Speaker 1: But yeah, so skin is real important.

743
00:43:16,642 --> 00:43:23,003
Speaker 1: But at the same time, skin is unique from most of the other organs in that it has an aesthetic quality to it.

744
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:23,165
Speaker 1: Right.

745
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:33,079
Speaker 1: You can because the doctor can see it, which is great, but everyone else can see it, at least to cover your like, if you worry about the aesthetics of your hearts or lungs.

746
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:33,771
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:35,617
Speaker 0: There's something weird going on.

748
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:36,167
Speaker 1: Right.

749
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:36,720
Speaker 1: Right.

750
00:43:37,023 --> 00:43:41,625
Speaker 1: There are other parts of your body, you know, people worry about the aesthetics of their eyes or their hair.

751
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:41,809
Speaker 1: Right.

752
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:43,138
Speaker 1: Or maybe their nails.

753
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:46,600
Speaker 1: But other than that, it's it's mostly skin, right?

754
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,348
Speaker 0: So hair and nails are at least skin adjacent, like they're attached right there.

755
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:51,159
Speaker 0: Also on the outside.

756
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:51,926
Speaker 1: Yeah.

757
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:54,347
Speaker 1: It's skin is the number one aesthetic thing.

758
00:43:54,408 --> 00:44:15,809
Speaker 1: So in addition to, you know, this sort of crossover between, you know, capitalism wise, right, of, you know, take care of your skin to look good, have it be shiny and clean and, you know, all these beauty standards and whatnot, and also take care of your skin for it to be healthy.

759
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:16,220
Speaker 1: Right.

760
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,936
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, obviously you got to do the healthy one that no matter what.

761
00:44:20,998 --> 00:44:21,100
Speaker 1: Right.

762
00:44:21,402 --> 00:44:21,976
Speaker 1: If you can.

763
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,911
Speaker 0: But the separation between the healthy things and the aesthetic things and also the completely fake things, there's.

764
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:32,079
Speaker 0: there's a wide gulf between these three things in many cases.

765
00:44:32,823 --> 00:44:33,106
Speaker 1: Yeah.

766
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:44,539
Speaker 1: And but there's also an industry that is, you know, come up and trying to take people's money right in exchange for the promise, true or false of, you know, aesthetically good skin.

767
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:45,298
Speaker 1: Right.

768
00:44:46,665 --> 00:44:48,040
Speaker 1: And some of that is legit.

769
00:44:48,883 --> 00:44:52,598
Speaker 1: And there's nothing wrong with wanting your skin to look nicer and making it look nice.

770
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,680
Speaker 1: That's totally cool.

771
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,022
Speaker 0: Right.

772
00:44:54,043 --> 00:44:58,920
Speaker 0: Well, we also can't hold people to like beauty standards have a lot of problems.

773
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,798
Speaker 0: Like, obviously, we're not doing the show about that.

774
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:08,845
Speaker 0: But if someone like if I'm injured, like having a skin problem is no different than having a leg problem or anything that's visible.

775
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:13,318
Speaker 0: And a lot of people will judge their own self-worth and the self-worth of others based on those aesthetics.

776
00:45:14,085 --> 00:45:14,248
Speaker 1: Right.

777
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:15,425
Speaker 1: And you shouldn't be doing that either.

778
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:17,836
Speaker 1: You know what someone's skin looks like.

779
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,402
Speaker 1: Right.

780
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:21,554
Speaker 1: Doesn't say anything about who that person is underneath that skin.

781
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,923
Speaker 0: I consider myself very fortunate that I didn't have to deal with acne because I know a lot of people who did.

782
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:28,157
Speaker 0: And acne sucks ass.

783
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:29,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucks.

784
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,103
Speaker 1: But, you know, I mean, the problem is, you know, that's also a health thing.

785
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:34,286
Speaker 1: Right.

786
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:35,179
Speaker 1: Because acne hurts.

787
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:35,886
Speaker 0: It is.

788
00:45:35,987 --> 00:45:36,880
Speaker 0: It needs treatment.

789
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,072
Speaker 0: But it's also just.

790
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,900
Speaker 1: it's not just the aesthetic aspect of it.

791
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,539
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

792
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:40,871
Speaker 1: Yep.

793
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:44,640
Speaker 1: So I've so but it's so anyway.

794
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,520
Speaker 1: So what happens, right, is it like?

795
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:53,160
Speaker 1: I'm saying capitalism wise, there are people who are trying to sell various things, many of which are complete nonsense.

796
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:54,186
Speaker 1: Right.

797
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,360
Speaker 1: Because people have these feelings about their skin.

798
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:57,805
Speaker 1: Right.

799
00:45:57,866 --> 00:46:04,900
Speaker 1: They can be taken advantage of into buying all sorts of expensive, you know, maybe, maybe not helpful stuff.

800
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:05,572
Speaker 1: Right.

801
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:05,838
Speaker 1: Yeah.

802
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:09,860
Speaker 1: And this, you know, the skincare sort of industry.

803
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:10,766
Speaker 1: Right.

804
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:13,780
Speaker 1: Obviously, it's not new as a whole.

805
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:14,185
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:16,020
Speaker 1: It's like even I don't know that much history.

807
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:24,026
Speaker 1: I didn't research the history of skincare, but it's like even I know about stuff like the oil that they would scrape off of gladiators and ancient Greece and shit.

808
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:24,355
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:25,287
Speaker 0: Yeah.

810
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:28,379
Speaker 0: It's tied very much to bathing culture and also cosmetics.

811
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:42,379
Speaker 1: So it's not new, but what is relatively new, right, is just the wide array of, you know, different types of products and things.

812
00:46:42,521 --> 00:46:42,663
Speaker 1: Right.

813
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:48,738
Speaker 1: If you think about like what did you know, if my grandmother went to the store to buy some stuff for her skin.

814
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,301
Speaker 1: Right.

815
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:51,708
Speaker 1: What was available then in the 50s, 60s?

816
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:53,342
Speaker 1: Right.

817
00:46:53,727 --> 00:47:12,720
Speaker 1: It's like not that many things compared to today where you can have a whole store that's just a fucking skin store and they've just got shelves and shelves and shelves of different things they can sell to you to put on your skin to help with different things, you know, like a wide range of price points and quantity and like just so much stuff.

818
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:13,639
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, my God.

819
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:26,820
Speaker 1: You know, some of that is very, very positive in that, hey, we've got, you know, our advanced science, medical science, right, has let us come up with all these great things to help out our skin.

820
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:27,346
Speaker 1: Right.

821
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:28,990
Speaker 1: That we couldn't we didn't have before.

822
00:47:29,031 --> 00:47:29,560
Speaker 1: That's amazing.

823
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

824
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:30,180
Speaker 1: Right.

825
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:31,328
Speaker 1: You can have.

826
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:32,785
Speaker 1: people probably have skin.

827
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:41,678
Speaker 1: You know, it's like some a normal person today can have way better skin than like, you know, very wealthy people from the 50s could because they didn't have.

828
00:47:42,366 --> 00:47:44,058
Speaker 1: even if they spent all their money, what could they get?

829
00:47:46,085 --> 00:47:50,319
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, right, a lot of stuff is just nonsense trying to take your money.

830
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,023
Speaker 1: Right.

831
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:53,872
Speaker 1: It's not or is possibly even actively harmful

832
00:47:54,215 --> 00:48:13,537
Speaker 0: or also are often treated as pancias, because the one thing if I internalized anything about what I do know about skin and skin care is that individual people, even with very similar genetics, often have radically different skin situations and very few pieces of advice about skin are universally useful to people.

833
00:48:14,384 --> 00:48:14,526
Speaker 1: Yeah.

834
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:20,256
Speaker 1: The only I think the only universally useful skin advice probably wear some sunscreen and bathe.

835
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:20,803
Speaker 1: Right.

836
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:22,659
Speaker 1: It's like avoid skin cancer.

837
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:22,972
Speaker 1: Yeah.

838
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:28,440
Speaker 0: Oh, I will admit, full disclosure, I rarely wear sunscreen.

839
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:36,246
Speaker 1: Unless I'm the tick tock determine, I mean, I don't wear it unless, you know, if I'm going out in the sun, I wear it and I always wear a hat.

840
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:39,068
Speaker 0: I only wear it if I'm going out into the sun for a moderate like.

841
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:40,293
Speaker 0: I know I'm going to be out in the sun.

842
00:48:40,882 --> 00:48:47,378
Speaker 0: I wear if I'm going to go biking or and I wear it skiing because that is like that is sunburned central way more than the beach.

843
00:48:48,183 --> 00:48:48,384
Speaker 1: Yeah.

844
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:53,319
Speaker 1: But the tick tock dermatologist says wear sunscreen just every fucking day, every day.

845
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:56,377
Speaker 0: I'm honestly not willing to because it's too much of a pain.

846
00:48:56,764 --> 00:48:57,579
Speaker 0: It's too greasy.

847
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,434
Speaker 0: I mean, I get paid if I were not a doctor.

848
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:01,639
Speaker 0: I'll trade there.

849
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:12,200
Speaker 0: Oh, personally, I've traded that risk for because when I do wear sunscreen regularly, like long sports things, I tend to get a bunch of pimples and things on all the places I'm putting the sunscreen.

850
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:14,183
Speaker 0: Especially my face, what is skin care?

851
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:22,743
Speaker 1: I mean, there probably are other skin diseases that are deadly that I'm not aware of being not a doctor, but skin cancer is the common, very deadly one.

852
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:23,390
Speaker 1: Right.

853
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,679
Speaker 1: So you want to keep keep an eye on your skin, look out for it and protect that.

854
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,104
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the biggest thing.

855
00:49:29,144 --> 00:49:37,420
Speaker 0: The thing I watch out for in my own skin is did something change where I don't have a good explanation for why it changed, right?

856
00:49:37,782 --> 00:49:39,765
Speaker 0: Like, do I have I have a sore somewhere?

857
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:41,405
Speaker 0: Was I picket at something?

858
00:49:41,527 --> 00:49:42,520
Speaker 0: Did I hurt myself?

859
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,002
Speaker 0: Can I explain where that came from?

860
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:45,700
Speaker 0: OK, is that mold bigger?

861
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:47,400
Speaker 0: Is it actually bigger?

862
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,845
Speaker 0: I should pay attention to that mold.

863
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:49,600
Speaker 0: It seems like it's getting.

864
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,333
Speaker 1: let me measure it.

865
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:51,084
Speaker 1: Right.

866
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:52,383
Speaker 1: If you got a mole, measure it.

867
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:53,220
Speaker 1: Write it down somewhere.

868
00:49:53,422 --> 00:49:53,910
Speaker 0: Well, actually.

869
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,959
Speaker 0: So what I do, one thing I do, I'm going to do it just for the peace of mind of knowing if it actually got bigger.

870
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,280
Speaker 0: I only I did this like every five years until now.

871
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:11,913
Speaker 0: But now that I'm approaching 40, this is one of those things I'm going to do every year going forward, is get the the skin survey where they take pictures of my skin so that year over year they can see if anything is changing, because if

872
00:50:11,953 --> 00:50:14,252
Speaker 1: you can afford it and you got time for it, you know, do it.

873
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:15,450
Speaker 0: It's actually it's.

874
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:21,798
Speaker 1: it's especially if you are susceptible to it or have a history of it, like rim said, he has the clinic in my office actually does it for free.

875
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,359
Speaker 0: So, no.

876
00:50:23,661 --> 00:50:24,518
Speaker 1: OK, that sounds good.

877
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:26,114
Speaker 1: But I have seen some.

878
00:50:26,154 --> 00:50:31,908
Speaker 1: I have seen some like PSA style advertisements for it that were like, get naked, you know, like it was like a naked campaign.

879
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:37,310
Speaker 0: that was like, you know, but it was interesting when I when I did this, you know, most recently because there's more thorough and I'm an adult.

880
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,509
Speaker 0: It's been a while since I've done it.

881
00:50:38,529 --> 00:50:41,160
Speaker 0: And I have one mole that I felt like, oh, that mole must be bigger.

882
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,939
Speaker 0: It's probably like that mole feels like it's a problem.

883
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:47,243
Speaker 0: That is the biggest potential source of trouble that I can see on my own body.

884
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,731
Speaker 0: And the dermatologist like didn't even like.

885
00:50:49,832 --> 00:50:50,884
Speaker 0: like barely looked at it.

886
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:52,879
Speaker 0: And then at the end I was like, so I have any issues?

887
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,453
Speaker 0: They're like, no.

888
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:54,460
Speaker 0: And I was like, what about this mole?

889
00:50:54,562 --> 00:51:00,146
Speaker 0: And they were like, they literally asked me, do you want to see what a dangerous mole actually looks like?

890
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:00,774
Speaker 0: And I said no.

891
00:51:01,582 --> 00:51:03,856
Speaker 0: And she said, that mole is not dangerous.

892
00:51:06,243 --> 00:51:07,297
Speaker 0: And I left it at that.

893
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:12,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, my dermatologist, that dermatologist I've been to twice is pretty awesome, just saying.

894
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,669
Speaker 1: I mean, I know the dermatologist that I saw for one minute was I would go back to the reef if they stood around.

895
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,489
Speaker 1: It was a long time ago.

896
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:33,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess in terms of the whole like sunburn things like sunscreen, part of the reason why I probably don't wear sunscreen as often as I should is that I don't tend to burn or I don't tend to burn badly.

897
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:37,479
Speaker 0: Like I tend to get pretty swarthy if I get a lot of sun pretty quickly.

898
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,779
Speaker 0: Like just that's just luck of genetics, I guess.

899
00:51:42,784 --> 00:51:46,519
Speaker 1: So there is one thing about skin that I researched somewhat recently.

900
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:55,039
Speaker 1: And, you know, obviously don't trust what I'm saying because it is based on Internet research, even though I was reading things from like Harvard Medical or whatever.

901
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,219
Speaker 1: So research it yourself.

902
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:06,339
Speaker 1: But what I learned, right, my interpretation of what I read is I was I was very curious because so many things out there claim to moisturize, right?

903
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,339
Speaker 1: Like everything in the universe is like moisturize your skin.

904
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,759
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the fuck does that even mean?

905
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:12,602
Speaker 1: Right.

906
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:17,565
Speaker 1: You know, like, you know, people have some dry skin and it's like something like chapped lips or whatever.

907
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:21,526
Speaker 1: But it's like I've never really felt like my skin was dry anywhere.

908
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:23,797
Speaker 1: Maybe like, I guess, elbow skin, maybe.

909
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:24,184
Speaker 1: Right.

910
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:26,560
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't know what are these people talking about?

911
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:26,813
Speaker 1: Right.

912
00:52:27,983 --> 00:52:34,427
Speaker 1: So I looked it up and basically the deal is that, like, yeah, obviously your skin can dry out.

913
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:35,020
Speaker 1: That's a thing.

914
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:36,756
Speaker 1: I guess it just doesn't happen to me too much.

915
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:41,160
Speaker 0: I've never really had that happen unless I was sick or skiing.

916
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:43,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've only 90 percent.

917
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,107
Speaker 1: I think the vast majority of my personal dry skin was chapped lip.

918
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:47,625
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

919
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:51,220
Speaker 0: But like that's the thing, like some people just need to use like chapstick constantly.

920
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:55,760
Speaker 0: I literally only use it like once or twice a year during like the peak of ski season and never any.

921
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,283
Speaker 1: I use it.

922
00:52:56,303 --> 00:53:01,437
Speaker 1: I need it if I go biking or if I go or if I actually go outside in the winter more.

923
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:04,384
Speaker 1: Nowadays, I stay inside the winter right.

924
00:53:04,425 --> 00:53:07,000
Speaker 1: So you can come ski with me sometime.

925
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:08,563
Speaker 1: Right.

926
00:53:08,624 --> 00:53:13,177
Speaker 1: So then I was looking at all these, you know, how many different crazy products are out there that claim to moisturize.

927
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:13,723
Speaker 1: Right.

928
00:53:13,784 --> 00:53:15,939
Speaker 1: And I was like, some of these had to be lying.

929
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:16,264
Speaker 1: Right.

930
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:19,122
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, this must be some, you know, it smelled fishy to me.

931
00:53:19,385 --> 00:53:19,547
Speaker 1: Right.

932
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:24,739
Speaker 1: Especially since when you look at the products, I look at like the list of active ingredients.

933
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:30,040
Speaker 1: When I would look at those lists of active ingredients, the sunscreen ingredients would always be listed as active ingredients.

934
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:37,525
Speaker 1: And none of these other ingredients that they would brag about on the front of the product would be listed as active ingredients on the back of the product.

935
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:43,160
Speaker 1: And I was like, I was just like, does that mean they haven't proven that they moisturize or like what, you know, what's the deal?

936
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,219
Speaker 1: They're claiming they can moisturize or whatever.

937
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:46,147
Speaker 1: Right.

938
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:46,880
Speaker 1: Is that legit?

939
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:47,860
Speaker 1: Is it not legit?

940
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,427
Speaker 1: What's the?

941
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:49,079
Speaker 1: what's the deal?

942
00:53:49,863 --> 00:53:59,040
Speaker 1: You know, so what I found out is it basically is like all you need, according to a thing I read in Harvard that it probably maybe could find the link again.

943
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,577
Speaker 0: See what you say, because I got the I got a Mayo Clinic article up.

944
00:54:01,597 --> 00:54:02,499
Speaker 0: that's giving me some info.

945
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:02,602
Speaker 0: OK.

946
00:54:04,062 --> 00:54:12,500
Speaker 1: And basically what the article was said was that all you need to do to moisturize skin is water, obviously, because that's what you're moisturizing with.

947
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:12,864
Speaker 1: Right.

948
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,586
Speaker 1: But if you just put water on yourself, that won't moisturize you.

949
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,058
Speaker 1: Why?

950
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,299
Speaker 1: Because the moisture, the water will just go away.

951
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:22,547
Speaker 1: There's nothing to trap the water on you.

952
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:22,959
Speaker 1: Right.

953
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:23,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

954
00:54:23,806 --> 00:54:25,624
Speaker 0: Actually, that is a specific danger.

955
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:27,179
Speaker 0: A PSA for all of you out there.

956
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,884
Speaker 0: Hikers often get parasites like this.

957
00:54:29,945 --> 00:54:42,352
Speaker 0: is the thing is campers and hikers because they'll be a little bit dehydrated and their lips will get dry while hiking and they might take stream water and put it on their lips because it temporary, like very briefly, makes them feel less chapped and dry.

958
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:45,069
Speaker 0: But then they immediately feel chapped and dry again.

959
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:46,657
Speaker 0: And now you've got parasites in your mouth.

960
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:47,833
Speaker 1: Yep.

961
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:56,420
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so water alone cannot cure your dry skin problem.

962
00:54:56,582 --> 00:54:56,824
Speaker 1: Right.

963
00:54:56,985 --> 00:55:02,560
Speaker 1: What you need to moisturize your skin is water combined with some kind of grease.

964
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,645
Speaker 1: Right.

965
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:04,662
Speaker 1: And you're like, well, wait a minute.

966
00:55:04,682 --> 00:55:06,906
Speaker 1: The grease in the water don't mix.

967
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:07,799
Speaker 1: How does that work?

968
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:08,505
Speaker 1: Right.

969
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,848
Speaker 1: It's like, well, basically, you know, you've got.

970
00:55:10,868 --> 00:55:17,839
Speaker 1: they create something such that the, you know, the grease is trapping the water against you.

971
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:18,304
Speaker 1: Right.

972
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:20,919
Speaker 1: So the water goes on your skin with the grease.

973
00:55:21,424 --> 00:55:21,566
Speaker 1: Right.

974
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:22,679
Speaker 1: You're all slimy now.

975
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:29,180
Speaker 1: But the water won't evaporate away because you basically slapped a grease shield on yourself.

976
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:29,765
Speaker 1: Right.

977
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,538
Speaker 1: So your body will naturally release oils.

978
00:55:32,782 --> 00:55:32,924
Speaker 1: Right.

979
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:36,120
Speaker 1: Which I found out that the names of oil is sebum.

980
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,699
Speaker 1: You got the sebaceous glands.

981
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:38,980
Speaker 1: They squirt sebum.

982
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,040
Speaker 0: That's how I get some seborrheic dermatitis sometimes.

983
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,180
Speaker 0: So I know a lot about sebum.

984
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:43,581
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:46,279
Speaker 1: I mean, my bald head squirts out a bunch of sebum.

986
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:46,604
Speaker 1: Right.

987
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:47,800
Speaker 1: And it gets all sebaceous.

988
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:50,380
Speaker 1: It's all greasy on the bald head.

989
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:51,179
Speaker 1: It's a problem.

990
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:58,339
Speaker 1: And so the sebum is sort of a double edged sword that your body makes, because on the one hand, it does protect your skin.

991
00:55:58,663 --> 00:55:58,926
Speaker 1: Right.

992
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:00,998
Speaker 1: Your body makes its own grease to protect itself.

993
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,642
Speaker 1: Right.

994
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:04,247
Speaker 1: It's it's kind of smart, but it can.

995
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:05,983
Speaker 1: some people make too much grease.

996
00:56:06,307 --> 00:56:07,358
Speaker 1: Some people don't make enough.

997
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:09,860
Speaker 1: So, you know, it can be kind of gross.

998
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:10,345
Speaker 1: It's not.

999
00:56:10,406 --> 00:56:11,199
Speaker 1: it's not very nice.

1000
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:11,906
Speaker 1: Grease.

1001
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:12,380
Speaker 1: Right.

1002
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,376
Speaker 1: You can get better grease.

1003
00:56:14,864 --> 00:56:16,318
Speaker 0: Oh, I have got any grease.

1004
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:17,880
Speaker 1: Have you got any grease?

1005
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,754
Speaker 1: Then grease me up.

1006
00:56:18,816 --> 00:56:19,020
Speaker 1: Right.

1007
00:56:19,882 --> 00:56:21,180
Speaker 1: It's like the grease alone doesn't do.

1008
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:26,820
Speaker 1: it has to be grease with some sort of, you know, hydrating water or something.

1009
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:27,102
Speaker 1: Right.

1010
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:32,359
Speaker 1: Can't just you just take oil and alone like just olive oil is probably not going to do it.

1011
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:32,722
Speaker 1: Right.

1012
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:34,278
Speaker 1: Even though I guess ancient Greeks did that.

1013
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,198
Speaker 1: So, you know, the thing is, you know, what did my grandma do?

1014
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:39,501
Speaker 1: Right.

1015
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,218
Speaker 1: My grandma didn't have the skin store to go to.

1016
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:42,543
Speaker 1: Right.

1017
00:56:42,563 --> 00:56:44,879
Speaker 1: The Korean skincare was not available to grandma.

1018
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,938
Speaker 1: What the fuck did grandma do?

1019
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:46,844
Speaker 1: Right.

1020
00:56:46,884 --> 00:56:46,986
Speaker 1: No.

1021
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:48,409
Speaker 1: Grandma had fucking Vaseline.

1022
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:49,079
Speaker 1: That's what grandma had.

1023
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:49,343
Speaker 1: Yep.

1024
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:50,600
Speaker 0: That's what the Mayo Clinic does.

1025
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,200
Speaker 0: The first thing they list like Vaseline.

1026
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:53,854
Speaker 0: That's that's one of the best ones to use.

1027
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,658
Speaker 1: Vaseline is the thing.

1028
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,999
Speaker 0: Specifically, they say look for ointments with petroleum jelly, Vaseline, Aquaphor, stuff like that.

1029
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,160
Speaker 1: What's what's petroleum jelly?

1030
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:02,818
Speaker 1: It's fucking grease.

1031
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:03,215
Speaker 1: Yep.

1032
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:07,780
Speaker 1: It's like if you want to need to got dry skin, it's grease and water.

1033
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,079
Speaker 1: Vaseline is like the ultimate.

1034
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:09,463
Speaker 1: Right.

1035
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:19,379
Speaker 1: All the other moisturizing products out there are basically just a fancier Vaseline or maybe less good Vaseline, depending on which product it is.

1036
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:19,721
Speaker 1: Right.

1037
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:25,278
Speaker 1: It's some sort of different grease ish, oily jelly thing.

1038
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:26,226
Speaker 1: Right.

1039
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,698
Speaker 1: With some sort of hydration thing.

1040
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,311
Speaker 1: And some of them, you know, feel nicer.

1041
00:57:31,536 --> 00:57:31,720
Speaker 1: Right.

1042
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,060
Speaker 1: They're they're not all greasy and nasty and shiny like Vaseline is.

1043
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,680
Speaker 1: Some of them go on lighter.

1044
00:57:36,902 --> 00:57:37,064
Speaker 1: Right.

1045
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:38,360
Speaker 1: They don't feel as heavy.

1046
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:39,659
Speaker 1: Vaseline is really heavy.

1047
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:39,984
Speaker 1: Right.

1048
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,840
Speaker 1: It's like you imagine rubbing that all over your face.

1049
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:43,257
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, it's gross.

1050
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,132
Speaker 1: Right.

1051
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:46,340
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's a lot.

1052
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,940
Speaker 1: That's all it really comes down to is grease and water.

1053
00:57:51,301 --> 00:58:04,198
Speaker 1: So, you know, and even if you don't have dry skin, it may or may not, you know, be a good idea to use some sort of, you know, hydrating lotion or moisturizing lotion of some kind.

1054
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,860
Speaker 1: You know, because, A, it might do a better job than Sebum does.

1055
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:12,160
Speaker 1: It may help reduce your Sebum output and it'll be nicer, right.

1056
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,019
Speaker 1: It'll feel nicer than Sebum does.

1057
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:14,512
Speaker 1: Right.

1058
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:16,959
Speaker 1: You know, it does.

1059
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,120
Speaker 1: It might be a good idea.

1060
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1061
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,500
Speaker 1: So that's that's one thing I learned about was what what is the deal with skin moisturization?

1062
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,486
Speaker 1: That's it.

1063
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:29,959
Speaker 1: And everything beyond that is basically people trying to sell you stuff and be fancy.

1064
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:30,504
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1065
00:58:30,565 --> 00:58:31,991
Speaker 0: I mean, everyone has different circumstances.

1066
00:58:32,032 --> 00:58:35,319
Speaker 0: But again, like, I just feel very lucky that I don't need to do many things to my skin.

1067
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:42,392
Speaker 0: Most of my skin related stories are around injuries as opposed to just long standing or like simpler problems like that.

1068
00:58:44,105 --> 00:59:00,559
Speaker 1: And so that the second thing I learned, right, the only literally the only other thing I learned when doing that research was I was, you know, when you look at skin, a lot of skin products for things like, you know, acne or psoriasis or a lot of conditions.

1069
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:01,219
Speaker 1: Right.

1070
00:59:01,821 --> 00:59:05,205
Speaker 1: You always see an ingredient that I just kept seeing, even for dandruff.

1071
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:11,360
Speaker 1: One ingredient I just kept seeing over and over and over again and almost every product for several different conditions.

1072
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:12,086
Speaker 1: Right.

1073
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:16,359
Speaker 1: The over the counter products listed the active ingredient of salicylic acid.

1074
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:16,965
Speaker 1: Right.

1075
00:59:17,228 --> 00:59:19,604
Speaker 1: It's like there's so many products for so many different things.

1076
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:20,560
Speaker 1: List that ingredient.

1077
00:59:20,701 --> 00:59:21,187
Speaker 1: And I was like.

1078
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:34,339
Speaker 1: I was like, what the hey, like what's what's the deal with the salicylic acid that it's like this cure all like what, you know, like what's what's the deal with that, you know, and even other products I was seeing they were they were promoting like other acids like higher ilanic.

1079
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,499
Speaker 1: I don't know how to pronounce it.

1080
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:36,879
Speaker 0: I know the full deal with it.

1081
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:38,372
Speaker 0: So I see where you're going with this.

1082
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:39,625
Speaker 1: Right.

1083
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:39,788
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1084
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:41,378
Speaker 1: They're promoting all these other acids.

1085
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:41,906
Speaker 1: Right.

1086
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:42,661
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, what's up?

1087
00:59:42,723 --> 00:59:44,189
Speaker 1: Why would you want to put acid on your face?

1088
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,476
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound like a good idea.

1089
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:46,701
Speaker 1: Right.

1090
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:51,152
Speaker 1: It's like, why is why is this stuff such a popular product?

1091
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:51,440
Speaker 1: Right.

1092
00:59:51,884 --> 01:00:01,356
Speaker 1: And basically what the deal is, is those acids right are basically exactly the right strength to, you know, clean away filth.

1093
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,081
Speaker 1: Right.

1094
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:04,878
Speaker 1: Better than, you know, water alone.

1095
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:11,619
Speaker 1: Unlike soap, they won't remove, you know, the like good stuff.

1096
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:11,903
Speaker 1: Right.

1097
01:00:11,963 --> 01:00:14,895
Speaker 1: Or dry you out the way soap will because soap washes away the grease.

1098
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:15,474
Speaker 1: Right.

1099
01:00:16,403 --> 01:00:17,519
Speaker 1: That you need to stay hydrated.

1100
01:00:19,684 --> 01:00:21,978
Speaker 1: And they'll burn through other things.

1101
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:22,522
Speaker 1: Right.

1102
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:25,759
Speaker 1: Like all the shit clogging up your pores and whatnot, because it's acid.

1103
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,716
Speaker 1: But they're not going to mess up your skin because they just.

1104
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:39,157
Speaker 1: they did a lot of research over the years and they found like the exact acids that are, you know, good for cleaning your skin, getting rid of all the stuff on you, but not hurting you.

1105
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:47,077
Speaker 0: Well, also, chemically, that is very adjacent to just aspirin and assault of that is like that's Pepto Bismol.

1106
01:00:49,122 --> 01:00:50,273
Speaker 1: Pepto Bismol is also like.

1107
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:51,330
Speaker 0: it's also bismuth.

1108
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,615
Speaker 0: Hence bizz.

1109
01:00:54,723 --> 01:00:56,340
Speaker 0: It's bismuth and salicylic acid.

1110
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,436
Speaker 0: That is literally what's in there.

1111
01:00:58,944 --> 01:00:59,106
Speaker 1: Yep.

1112
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:05,019
Speaker 1: So one of the things I took away from that research was like, hey, you know, I've been cleaning my face with soap.

1113
01:01:05,502 --> 01:01:05,765
Speaker 1: Right.

1114
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:10,819
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, should I be cleaning my face with some facial cleanser?

1115
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,900
Speaker 0: My entire life I have when I wash my face, I never use soap and I only use my hands.

1116
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:20,238
Speaker 0: I basically wash my face with my hands and water and that's it.

1117
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:21,359
Speaker 0: I've done that my whole life.

1118
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,298
Speaker 1: So you're using your natural face grease.

1119
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:23,662
Speaker 0: Yep.

1120
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,520
Speaker 0: Natural face grease.

1121
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,960
Speaker 0: I don't put anything on my face ever except occasional chapstick and sunscreen.

1122
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,277
Speaker 1: Well, I was having problems with my skin under my beard, so that's why I was looking into this.

1123
01:01:32,861 --> 01:01:39,839
Speaker 0: So now that I have a beard, this is hair because I don't have any skin problems with the beard, but I do put beard oil in my beard.

1124
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,324
Speaker 1: But I tried the oil and the oil helped.

1125
01:01:42,425 --> 01:01:47,757
Speaker 1: It made me let my beard get longer before things started to itch and get bad, but it didn't let it go.

1126
01:01:48,501 --> 01:02:00,019
Speaker 0: See, for me, the oil is only because it smells nice, like I'm basically using it like a cologne and it helps keep my beard like shaped nicely, like it prevents as many stray hairs from popping up, kind of holds it together.

1127
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:05,415
Speaker 0: And I have a thicker like beard balm I use if I'm going out that I kind of it's almost like hair gel for my beard.

1128
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:11,219
Speaker 1: But the beard oil is a form of, you know, moisturizing of the skin underneath the beard.

1129
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:11,626
Speaker 1: Right.

1130
01:02:11,647 --> 01:02:11,920
Speaker 1: It does.

1131
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:12,540
Speaker 1: It does serve.

1132
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,099
Speaker 0: But if I don't use it, the skin's fine.

1133
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,996
Speaker 0: The only difference is the beard is a slightly more ready looking and I don't smell as nice.

1134
01:02:19,766 --> 01:02:25,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, the beard oil helped me get the beard longer before the itching and stuff happened, but it wasn't a permanent solution.

1135
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,659
Speaker 1: I couldn't grow like an infinite beard with the beard oil.

1136
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,559
Speaker 1: It didn't get me there.

1137
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,620
Speaker 1: So I was like, all right, fine.

1138
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:32,403
Speaker 1: I'll shave off my beard and I'll work.

1139
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:34,023
Speaker 1: I will apply things to my skin.

1140
01:02:34,124 --> 01:02:37,800
Speaker 1: So I got a completely normal, right?

1141
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,318
Speaker 1: Not, you know, drugstore facial cleansing thing.

1142
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:43,780
Speaker 1: And is it better for my skin?

1143
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:44,457
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

1144
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:45,545
Speaker 1: I can't.

1145
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:46,316
Speaker 1: I can't tell you.

1146
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:47,125
Speaker 1: Right.

1147
01:02:47,247 --> 01:02:47,550
Speaker 1: Is it?

1148
01:02:47,853 --> 01:02:48,724
Speaker 1: should you go and get one?

1149
01:02:48,805 --> 01:02:49,418
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

1150
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,066
Speaker 1: All right.

1151
01:02:50,086 --> 01:02:50,395
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1152
01:02:51,503 --> 01:02:57,039
Speaker 1: But what I can tell you is that using it definitely a cleans my face as well as soap did.

1153
01:02:57,302 --> 01:02:57,949
Speaker 1: Right.

1154
01:02:58,009 --> 01:02:58,979
Speaker 1: My face is not dirty.

1155
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:05,059
Speaker 1: And B, it feels nicer than to clean my face with that than it does to use regular old soap.

1156
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:08,437
Speaker 1: It you know, there's just something about it with the way they've concocted it.

1157
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:10,880
Speaker 1: I can see that if it feels nice.

1158
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:12,051
Speaker 1: Right.

1159
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:14,987
Speaker 1: To clean your face with that instead of just, you know, soap.

1160
01:03:15,049 --> 01:03:15,234
Speaker 1: So.

1161
01:03:18,346 --> 01:03:21,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess that's that's what I learned about the acid situation.

1162
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a shot.

1163
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,476
Speaker 1: It's just shocking how many different skin conditions.

1164
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:33,695
Speaker 1: the over the counter medication, like the active ingredient, even though, you know, you think they're different conditions, the active ingredients, just like salicylic acid.

1165
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,630
Speaker 0: So that's sort of completely orthogonal tangent, partly because we've already got a pretty long time on this show.

1166
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,888
Speaker 0: We had more to say than I expected.

1167
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:47,599
Speaker 0: But good before antibiotics, skin damage was one of the leading causes of death in humans.

1168
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:55,440
Speaker 0: Once you got past things like hunger and like like significant endemic diseases, like I've said, they didn't have the products.

1169
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,879
Speaker 1: They didn't have anything to deal with it.

1170
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,759
Speaker 1: They had three separate points in my life.

1171
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:03,540
Speaker 0: I literally would have died if antibiotics did not exist.

1172
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:08,640
Speaker 0: Like I would have just died because I've had cellulitis three different times due to injuries that I've suffered.

1173
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:14,505
Speaker 1: I've had a lot of poison ivy in my younger days to take like steroids to get rid of the poison ivy.

1174
01:04:14,687 --> 01:04:19,202
Speaker 0: So cellulitis, like I like I've always dealt with it appropriately, but a part of the reason.

1175
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:28,019
Speaker 0: even today, people still die of it, even in places where antibiotics are readily accessible, partly because for whatever reason, probably due to the way society is.

1176
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,259
Speaker 0: There's a lot of factors here.

1177
01:04:30,024 --> 01:04:38,640
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't really understand how serious of a problem and how dangerous a skin infection like that is and how fast it will progress.

1178
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:47,409
Speaker 0: Like people will have an infection, like an infected minor wound, and it gets a little red and swollen and they just like don't think much about it.

1179
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:52,699
Speaker 0: Or because the American health care system is so fucked up, they avoid going to the doctor because it doesn't seem that bad.

1180
01:04:53,102 --> 01:04:55,340
Speaker 0: And then like overnight it can become life threatening.

1181
01:04:56,744 --> 01:05:06,585
Speaker 1: I guess the one last thing is that, you know, you know, we've been talking about the skin conditions and you know, you're the most of the ones we've been talking about are ones that are like they exist on the skin only.

1182
01:05:06,605 --> 01:05:11,927
Speaker 1: It's like there are other conditions that like, you know, you're not going to, you know, chicken pox, right?

1183
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,756
Speaker 1: It's like it shows up on your skin.

1184
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:20,940
Speaker 0: But well, I saw it in my in my most.

1185
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,318
Speaker 1: Leprosy shows up on your skin.

1186
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,619
Speaker 0: My most recent.

1187
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,680
Speaker 1: But leprosy is not a skin disease with cellulitis.

1188
01:05:26,901 --> 01:05:29,980
Speaker 0: It was right before covid because remember I broke my toe at PAX East.

1189
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:36,954
Speaker 0: So I broke my toe just randomly at PAX East and I taped it up.

1190
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:43,200
Speaker 0: Taping it up was a mistake because after that incident, it's like a weird skin thing that happened.

1191
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:49,838
Speaker 0: I developed an allergy to the adhesive in medical bandages.

1192
01:05:52,221 --> 01:05:56,879
Speaker 0: Only I know someone I know someone who got a certain parts of my body like it.

1193
01:05:57,222 --> 01:05:59,160
Speaker 0: It was super weird how this happened.

1194
01:05:59,482 --> 01:06:02,072
Speaker 0: And even my doctor was like, yeah, that can happen.

1195
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:03,249
Speaker 0: Like there was some confluence of.

1196
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:12,680
Speaker 0: I got cellulitis from a wound because of damage from contact dermatitis and possibly a latent athlete's foot infection.

1197
01:06:13,023 --> 01:06:18,318
Speaker 0: That was not bothering me like it wasn't noticeable, but it got aggravated by the fact that I had an open skin wound.

1198
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:23,798
Speaker 1: I know someone who had a medication that came on a patch and you have to replace the patch.

1199
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,380
Speaker 1: It was yet to replace the patch like every once in a while.

1200
01:06:26,501 --> 01:06:26,724
Speaker 1: Right.

1201
01:06:27,168 --> 01:06:27,875
Speaker 1: But they became.

1202
01:06:27,895 --> 01:06:32,540
Speaker 1: they had a. they had some sort of reaction to the adhesive on the patch and the medication was working.

1203
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:38,379
Speaker 0: Oh, even when I guess I want to get to my covid shot because the condition that they had because of this new allergy, I got my first covid shot and they put a bandaid on it.

1204
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,819
Speaker 0: And when I came home, I took the bandaid off the next day.

1205
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:43,119
Speaker 0: You know what I had on my on my arm?

1206
01:06:43,623 --> 01:06:48,400
Speaker 0: A bright red bandaid shaped wound that stayed for like three weeks.

1207
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,068
Speaker 0: And there's still an echo of it on my skin.

1208
01:06:51,062 --> 01:06:53,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, but my skin doesn't do that right.

1209
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,825
Speaker 1: All skin and skin cells, right?

1210
01:06:55,866 --> 01:06:57,711
Speaker 1: They're they're living things that everyone's got.

1211
01:06:57,732 --> 01:06:59,700
Speaker 1: different DNA, different DNA makes themselves.

1212
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,300
Speaker 0: So but props again to dermatologists because I went to the doctor.

1213
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,440
Speaker 0: I went to a regular doctor.

1214
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:13,538
Speaker 0: Wasn't even a dermatologist because that cluster of I had a broken toe and a minor cellulitis coupled with contact dermatitis all in the same place.

1215
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,320
Speaker 0: I didn't know what any of that like.

1216
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,437
Speaker 0: I didn't understand any of that.

1217
01:07:16,498 --> 01:07:17,660
Speaker 0: that much when it happened.

1218
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:22,280
Speaker 0: But my foot, like the morning when I went to the doctor, looked terrifying.

1219
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,219
Speaker 0: Like it looked bad.

1220
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:29,660
Speaker 0: And I go to the doctor and the doctor looks at it and he just says, that isn't really anything.

1221
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:31,620
Speaker 0: Like I was like, what do you mean?

1222
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,885
Speaker 0: He's like, well, it's really nothing I can do.

1223
01:07:32,946 --> 01:07:33,900
Speaker 0: that'll go away on its own.

1224
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:34,719
Speaker 0: Just wait a few weeks.

1225
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:36,100
Speaker 0: It's not gangrene.

1226
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:46,539
Speaker 1: You got to imagine, like, if you're actually a dermatologist, it's like, you know, you've seen like some it's like we of your average person, how often do you see some horrific skin thing?

1227
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,062
Speaker 1: Right.

1228
01:07:47,203 --> 01:07:50,892
Speaker 1: It's like someone who has one is probably covering it in public.

1229
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:51,160
Speaker 1: Right.

1230
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,884
Speaker 1: You know, they're probably not showing it off as they walk down the street.

1231
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:54,250
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1232
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:54,859
Speaker 1: If they can help.

1233
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:55,880
Speaker 1: Well, there's the analogy.

1234
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,800
Speaker 0: You think about when we see someone's computer, that is, shall we say, poorly managed.

1235
01:08:01,303 --> 01:08:05,120
Speaker 0: We look at it and instantly are like, wow, that is full of malware.

1236
01:08:05,524 --> 01:08:06,260
Speaker 0: That is broken.

1237
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,152
Speaker 0: That is broken.

1238
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:08,112
Speaker 0: And the person be like, well, it's fine.

1239
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:08,876
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

1240
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,402
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1241
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,910
Speaker 1: And then we'll see someone else's computer and it doesn't have a bunch of malware.

1242
01:08:14,012 --> 01:08:15,276
Speaker 1: And then I'd be like, oh, I got a problem.

1243
01:08:15,296 --> 01:08:15,914
Speaker 1: Like, no, you don't.

1244
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:15,998
Speaker 1: Yep.

1245
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,680
Speaker 0: Someone comes like, oh, I think my computer is having a serious problem.

1246
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:21,020
Speaker 1: The bump you have on your arm.

1247
01:08:21,121 --> 01:08:24,979
Speaker 1: And they're like, I just saw a guy who's like, you know, had no skin left or something.

1248
01:08:25,343 --> 01:08:26,040
Speaker 1: That's what they saw.

1249
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,600
Speaker 1: They've seen such horrific shit.

1250
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,879
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, or, you know, such, you know, way worse people in way worse shape.

1251
01:08:32,903 --> 01:08:33,430
Speaker 1: They look at you.

1252
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:33,957
Speaker 1: They're like, OK.

1253
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:39,019
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean that just because you have something that doesn't look like a big deal, you shouldn't go get it checked out.

1254
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:39,442
Speaker 1: Right.

1255
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:39,645
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1256
01:08:39,685 --> 01:08:41,448
Speaker 0: Go get it checked out and go.

1257
01:08:41,468 --> 01:08:42,256
Speaker 1: It'll take it'll do.

1258
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:45,946
Speaker 1: it means that it'll means it means go get it checked out because it'll take five minutes.

1259
01:08:45,966 --> 01:08:49,796
Speaker 1: They'll look at you and you'll have peace of mind and, you know, you'll be totally cool.

1260
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:50,562
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1261
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:55,500
Speaker 0: Like case in point, certain kinds of skin injuries I will treat at home rather than go to the doctor because I kind of like a broken rib.

1262
01:08:55,621 --> 01:08:58,004
Speaker 0: I know the doctor can't do anything.

1263
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:06,000
Speaker 0: But if you don't know, if you aren't sure, do not Google it because you're just going to see things that are going to disturb you and you're going to be convinced that you're dying.

1264
01:09:07,024 --> 01:09:15,179
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I guess the one last thing in these covid times, you know, one the last advantage of dermatology is that it's great for telemedicine.

1265
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:16,049
Speaker 1: Don't you could?

1266
01:09:16,372 --> 01:09:18,920
Speaker 1: you could just you know, because you can see it right.

1267
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,680
Speaker 1: You can show it on the on your little phone camera.

1268
01:09:21,862 --> 01:09:33,676
Speaker 0: I know you can look at multiple people who during covid had a skin thing where even in conversation with me, I was like, I know it's covid times, but you should get that checked out because that is that is beyond like.

1269
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:36,319
Speaker 0: that is at the level where if I were you, I would go to a doctor.

1270
01:09:37,224 --> 01:09:43,622
Speaker 0: And those people all did a telemedicine where a dermatologist on the other side was immediately able to say, nope, I know what that is.

1271
01:09:43,765 --> 01:09:44,939
Speaker 0: Don't fucking worry about it.

1272
01:09:45,924 --> 01:09:52,379
Speaker 1: I feel like there should be like a like a dermatology and maybe they have this at the dermatology conference, like a game show or like they show a photo.

1273
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:53,287
Speaker 1: I like.

1274
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:56,795
Speaker 1: I follow a Twitter like identify, identify the rash or whatever.

1275
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,339
Speaker 0: That packs a megathon finale.

1276
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,260
Speaker 1: Identify the right.

1277
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,178
Speaker 0: Identify the rash.

1278
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:08,440
Speaker 1: Maybe we should hire a dermatologist and make a website that's like a rash.

1279
01:10:10,823 --> 01:10:12,039
Speaker 1: Name that rash!

1280
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:13,599
Speaker 0: OK, I'm going to eat that.

1281
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:16,639
Speaker 0: I think it's food time indeed.

1282
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,277

1290
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:21,030
Speaker 0: You hold the key to my heart and a ton of people who do not want me to say their names.

1291
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:23,828
Speaker 0: So if you don't follow me on Twitter, you might have missed this.

1292
01:11:24,453 --> 01:11:34,630
Speaker 0: But earlier today, Ted Lieu, a Congress person, a Democrat, a progressive who I've respected for some time, said something pretty shitty on Twitter.

1293
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:37,459
Speaker 0: And I, you know, did what I would normally do.

1294
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:39,268
Speaker 0: And I called him out like I replied to him.

1295
01:11:39,891 --> 01:11:46,425
Speaker 0: But what I did not expect is that this sitting Congress person started arguing with me on Twitter.

1296
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:54,373
Speaker 0: And for the most of today, I've had to mute Twitter because there is like a shitstorm happening in my comments around this.

1297
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,635
Speaker 0: So you can go check that out if you want.

1298
01:11:56,716 --> 01:12:03,146
Speaker 0: But yeah, if I if you at me or DM me on Twitter anytime soon, I probably won't see it.

1299
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:06,669
Speaker 0: And we'll see how long it takes for this to calm down.

1300
01:12:07,131 --> 01:12:08,290
Speaker 0: He is 100 percent in the wrong.

1301
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,969
Speaker 0: And I stand by everything I said.

1302
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,870
Speaker 0: But I'm glad that my words got through to them.

1303
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:13,558
Speaker 0: I was.

1304
01:12:13,578 --> 01:12:24,409
Speaker 0: I think this is the first time in my life that a member of the actual Congress literally actually directly and personally responded to me with a real fight in my life.

1305
01:12:25,131 --> 01:12:28,661
Speaker 0: And yeah, so anyway, now I leave you with.

1306
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:31,688
Speaker 0: maybe I saw too well.

1307
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,710
Speaker 0: Hey, you're a great salesman.

1308
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,373
Speaker 0: Evil babies are not a problem for you.

1309
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:38,649
Speaker 0: They're an opportunity.

1310
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:41,728
Speaker 0: Where did I put those?

1311
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:42,961
Speaker 1: Oh, here they are.

1312
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,629
Speaker 0: Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of legit hammers?

1313
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,930
Speaker 0: Perfect for smashing through minerals or composite.

1314
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:52,328
Speaker 1: I'll take one.

1315
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:53,060
Speaker 1: Me, too.

1316
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:54,770
Speaker 1: Great decision.

1317
01:13:04,993 --> 01:13:06,630
Speaker 0: A little tap is all it takes.

1318
01:13:09,395 --> 01:13:11,270
Speaker 1: These baby smashing hammers are great.
