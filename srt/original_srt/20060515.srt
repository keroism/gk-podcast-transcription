1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,733
Speaker 1: It's Monday May 15th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:16,280
Speaker 1: We talk about the worst technologies ever.

3
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,297
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:20,737
Speaker 0: another successful geek end.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,028
Speaker 0: Indeed we had a bunch of friends over.

6
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,180
Speaker 0: we climbed that mountain and we played fury of Scott Johnson.

7
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:29,132
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't climb that mountain.

8
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:30,359
Speaker 1: I went home and then came back.

9
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:33,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rest of us call of food, but we did play fury of Dracula.

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:35,629
Speaker 1: We played free of Dracula.

11
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:37,900
Speaker 0: the game takes fucking five hours to play.

12
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,300
Speaker 1: It would have taken three and a half hours if there wasn't a rules ambiguity.

13
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:47,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though not to you know make fun of Scott because apparently according to people out in the forums I make fun of Scott too much.

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,014
Speaker 1: Oh, so now they know which one of us is which.

15
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:58,865
Speaker 0: again, I guess Uh-huh I just found that really hilarious because honestly in the real world most people would say the exact opposite because Scott's the one who calls Everyone stupid.

16
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,839
Speaker 1: I make fun of everybody he does.

17
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,968
Speaker 0: It's like we make fun of Cartman because he's fat.

18
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:06,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we make fun of Cartman because he's stupid.

19
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:09,153
Speaker 1: Yeah And they make fun of Cartman because he's ass.

20
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:10,119
Speaker 0: damn he already did me.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway we we all decided like everyone but Scott was like, all right, it's obvious.

22
00:01:18,156 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 0: the rule is this let's just play.

23
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:23,518
Speaker 0: But Scott let us on an hour and a half goose chase to try to find the actual rule.

24
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,097
Speaker 0: in the end He found out we were all right.

25
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:29,415
Speaker 1: But that point is is that you saw where the rule was in the rule book.

26
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:30,800
Speaker 1: You saw that didn't you?

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,026
Speaker 1: Where was the rule in the rule book?

28
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,575
Speaker 0: I'm not pretending that the rules were not shit Lee written.

29
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:38,687
Speaker 0: Okay, however I was okay with us.

30
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:40,354
Speaker 0: Just making up a rule and continuing.

31
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:41,960
Speaker 1: I'm not okay with making up rules.

32
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,178
Speaker 1: I got to find out the real rule.

33
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:48,180
Speaker 1: But now actually I think there aren't so many ambiguities left in that game.

34
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:55,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there could be a few situations that arise due to a combination of event cards and encounters and things but not many.

35
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:59,261
Speaker 1: I think we pretty much got the game down 100%.

36
00:01:59,261 --> 00:01:59,823
Speaker 0: Yep, of course.

37
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:04,099
Speaker 0: I specifically avoided one possible conflict with a car just because I didn't want to deal with it.

38
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, but other than that, I mean the game is fun.

39
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:11,780
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I'll probably play it a few more times at least see what happens.

40
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:16,920
Speaker 0: Yep, though in another quick metabit as you all know, I quit IBM and this is my last week.

41
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,980
Speaker 0: In fact tomorrow, I'm doing my last duty for IBM.

42
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:26,460
Speaker 0: I am going on a business trip to like bumblefuck Connecticut to install a server at this location all day.

43
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:28,400
Speaker 1: So what are you doing Wednesday Thursday Friday?

44
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:36,269
Speaker 0: Probably answering questions about all the things I've built for IBM for the last three years that no one knows how to maintain Or even knows what they do.

45
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,880
Speaker 1: Didn't you write documentation?

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,677
Speaker 0: Oh, I wrote documentation that no one ever read and I didn't document everything because let me put it this way.

47
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,952
Speaker 0: I Documented the things I did that needed documentation.

48
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,340
Speaker 0: I did not document how Linux works.

49
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,519
Speaker 0: That is the problem.

50
00:02:54,362 --> 00:03:03,346
Speaker 1: So, you know what you do is you go on your way to work tomorrow You stop at the bookstore and you get Linux for dummies and you give it to them and then you write and then you fill An expense report so you get your money back.

51
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:07,260
Speaker 0: I actually refused to do one project right now.

52
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:10,260
Speaker 0: They wanted in wine to make printing work.

53
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:20,296
Speaker 0: There are two ways to make printing work and because of stuff I don't want to get into I had to make it work the hard way where you get a Postscript driver that is built into wine to work inside of wine.

54
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,480
Speaker 1: Fuck that It's hard enough to get a post your cover to work in Linux for Linux.

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, now I know how to do it and it's not trivial, but I could have done it in a couple hours.

56
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:36,839
Speaker 0: But I basically told them that I'm not gonna do it and that they should really do it on their own because then they'll learn A lot about wine and Linux and then they won't be totally screwed when I leave.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,085
Speaker 0: That's good tough love.

58
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:42,317
Speaker 0: But anyway, I started the new job Monday and my benefits are crazy.

59
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,240
Speaker 1: Wait a minute tough love.

60
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:44,367
Speaker 1: I don't think there's any love.

61
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,032
Speaker 1: It's just tough.

62
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:49,187
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just tough shit, this is what it is.

63
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:52,860
Speaker 0: Yep, but they all want to take me out drinking and all this crap.

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,660
Speaker 0: But whatever the thing is my new company has crazy awesome benefits.

65
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:03,180
Speaker 0: Like I I pity the people who stayed at IBM now that I've seen what the rest of the IT world gives for benefits.

66
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:04,726
Speaker 0: I'm getting a lawyer.

67
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:07,015
Speaker 0: My company is giving me a lawyer.

68
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:15,499
Speaker 0: Well, they don't giving you a lawyer They're giving you access to a pool of lawyers Yes, which is going to cost me a grand total of like six dollars a month.

69
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:17,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good benefit.

70
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,247
Speaker 1: But um Generally, I don't want so many benefits.

71
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,800
Speaker 1: I'd rather have more money because most of the benefits I'll never ever use.

72
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:27,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is I there's all these benefits I could take that I'm opting out of and getting money.

73
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:29,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, see that's the way to go.

74
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

75
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:34,740
Speaker 0: I'm taking some sort of medical at least catastrophic medical in case I get hit by a car.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the only health insurance that I need is if I break my leg.

77
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:39,900
Speaker 1: I need a free fucking cast.

78
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:40,883
Speaker 1: That's what I need.

79
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,850
Speaker 0: Yep, and you know basic dental.

80
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,820
Speaker 0: because oh, yeah dental cleanings are like a hundred bucks.

81
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:48,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is my uncle's a dentist so that's not a big deal.

82
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,467
Speaker 0: Yeah But dental coverage is like eight bucks a month.

83
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:54,513
Speaker 1: but he is a lot more happier if I have insurance because then he gets some Money as opposed to just nothing.

84
00:04:55,118 --> 00:05:05,242
Speaker 0: Ah Actually, I don't have to deal with this but apparently a lot of HMOs and DMOs won't pay if the dentist or doctor you Go to is a blood relative Really?

85
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course fuck HMOs.

86
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:08,896
Speaker 0: I'm not dealing with any of that crap.

87
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have an HMO.

88
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,769
Speaker 1: I have PP whatever PPD whatever.

89
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:15,340
Speaker 1: I have to look at the card, but I'm too lazy to take out my wallet.

90
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, I barely understand it because most of that stuff doesn't involve me.

91
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,900
Speaker 0: I don't have any medical problems.

92
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:21,925
Speaker 0: I go to a doctor.

93
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,593
Speaker 0: like I got allergies.

94
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:25,060
Speaker 0: Give me a prescription for allergy medicine.

95
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:28,711
Speaker 1: I hardly ever go to a doctor unless I really really need to.

96
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:35,187
Speaker 0: yeah like that time when we told the story about With the leg right exactly.

97
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:36,029
Speaker 0: We're in that fight club.

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,474
Speaker 1: It's usually physical injury.

99
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:44,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when I go to a doctor extreme physical injury that might require stitches or casts.

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,962
Speaker 1: or You know.

101
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:51,540
Speaker 1: if anything's worse than a cast like if I need screws, I'll probably just kill myself.

102
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:55,406
Speaker 1: so That's not gonna happen either.

103
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:58,279
Speaker 0: Yep, and I actually want good dental because I have good teeth.

104
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,680
Speaker 1: I've got teeth that better teeth than anyone almost.

105
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is not anyone in the world, but I have damn good teeth.

106
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:06,372
Speaker 0: I have good teeth now because I had braces when I was a kid.

107
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:07,898
Speaker 1: I had braces when I was a kid.

108
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,926
Speaker 0: someday I'll tell the story of the the Debacle that was my braces.

109
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,833
Speaker 0: suffice to say I had them for almost nine years.

110
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:14,656
Speaker 1: Whoa.

111
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had braces.

112
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,484
Speaker 0: I got him off.

113
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,300
Speaker 0: then I got different braces from a different orthodontist.

114
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,050
Speaker 1: Yep Me too And it said it wasn't nine years.

115
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,439
Speaker 0: it when I finally.

116
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:25,046
Speaker 0: well It was like eight years and a little bit more.

117
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:29,044
Speaker 0: when I finally got him off and I chewed gum for the first time it Was like whoa.

118
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:30,291
Speaker 0: gum is awesome.

119
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:31,860
Speaker 1: Yeah gum sure is awesome.

120
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,520
Speaker 0: I love gum, but the braces kind of screwed up some of my teeth.

121
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:36,620
Speaker 0: So I got a bunch of fillings as a result.

122
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:40,195
Speaker 1: See, I only have two fillings and the first filling I ever got was when I was 21.

123
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:43,391
Speaker 0: Wow I have like six fillings Wow.

124
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, see it.

125
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:44,860
Speaker 1: My teeth are awesome.

126
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:49,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, I took the old mercury ones because just to inject a little Randy here.

127
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,380
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with amalgam fillings.

128
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,624
Speaker 0: They don't poison you.

129
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:53,687
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

130
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,392
Speaker 0: Stop spreading that urban legend you freaks.

131
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:56,696
Speaker 1: All right next Thursday.

132
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,800
Speaker 1: We'll talk about teeth.

133
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,631
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

134
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:00,620
Speaker 1: It's not bad at all.

135
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,400
Speaker 0: Okay, well Scott's got a lot of biting stories, oh I sure do okay.

136
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:10,048
Speaker 1: So anyway, today's episode is gonna be about worst Technologies because it's a worst week.

137
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:18,274
Speaker 1: every episode this week will be about the worst video games the worst anime manga comics and The worst I think we decided.

138
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:18,980
Speaker 1: the worst people.

139
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:25,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that either the worst people in history or the worst people we know currently We're not sure yet or both depending on how long it goes.

140
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:34,114
Speaker 1: I think worst people in history could be like three episodes and it might be more entertaining Especially since worst people we know should be saved for geek fables.

141
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,322
Speaker 1: Then we get more episodes out of true Plus.

142
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:41,440
Speaker 0: we have to decide how much information to give it worse people and how many which names to name and which names to?

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,596
Speaker 1: Just say so this guy and I want to remind everyone that there's a poll.

144
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:53,340
Speaker 0: if you go to front row crew calm Which is our website Currently, I just want to point out that geek night socks is winning great.

145
00:07:53,681 --> 00:08:04,319
Speaker 1: There's a poll on the right side of the page and I update it every now and then and I'll probably just you know Say something on the podcast whenever I change the poll so I can make sure everyone goes to answer it

146
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,007
Speaker 0: Even though almost no one answers it so far.

147
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,070
Speaker 0: That's fine.

148
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,619
Speaker 0: Like maybe maybe a fifth of our listeners answered the first one.

149
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:16,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, go to front row crew calm and on the right side of the page is a poll.

150
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:17,363
Speaker 1: Answer it.

151
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,760
Speaker 0: I'm just curious because I know there's a lot of people out there who listen and don't go to the website.

152
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:21,629
Speaker 0: I know you're there.

153
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,700
Speaker 0: I see you connecting.

154
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:28,500
Speaker 0: It's fine If you don't ever want to go but I'll note that we link to everything we talk about in case you ever get confused.

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, the things of the day the links are at front row crew calm.

156
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:32,595
Speaker 1: the news stories.

157
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:33,619
Speaker 1: the links are front row crew.

158
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,842
Speaker 1: calm You should go there.

159
00:08:34,863 --> 00:08:40,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

160
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:44,704
Speaker 1: Yeah What else is there?

161
00:08:44,864 --> 00:08:46,309
Speaker 1: Oh that logo contest.

162
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:47,674
Speaker 1: we should decide on one soon.

163
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've got a lot of submissions We're?

164
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:50,879
Speaker 0: we like many of them.

165
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,221
Speaker 0: There's.

166
00:08:51,341 --> 00:09:01,658
Speaker 1: there's a couple that I really like and if I could get the creators to slightly modify them, they would be perfect Meaning we'll probably be contacting a few people in the next in the coming weeks and talking.

167
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:10,647
Speaker 1: Yes So if you still want to submit a geek night's logo to win the $50 in cash for creating the best geek nights logo

168
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:14,904
Speaker 0: not to mention the fame on the website and the fact that you can put geek nights on Your resume

169
00:09:15,246 --> 00:09:27,384
Speaker 1: and we'll credit you in every episode and all that You should send in your logo submissions to geek nights at front row crew calm or post them in the forums at front row crew Calm forum.

170
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,920
Speaker 0: be aware that ones posted to the forums are subject to mockery by all the other forum denizens.

171
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:39,805
Speaker 1: Yes We will not comment on the logos until after the contest because that would be unfair for the contest because there's $50 involved.

172
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:45,851
Speaker 0: and bear in mind if you're not an artist if you just come up with the concept We know people who can turn it into a real logo.

173
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just need the concept the idea.

174
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:52,400
Speaker 1: Like if you just draw it like in pencil, that's cool.

175
00:09:52,884 --> 00:10:05,734
Speaker 1: And then we just you know After that's enough to win the contest and then later We'll turn it into a real fully photoshop shiny thing that we're actually is usable for printing on t-shirts and all that jazz Yep, and then we'll come the merch.

176
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:06,339
Speaker 1: Yep.

177
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:15,098
Speaker 1: So the requirements for the logo contest again is it should be a square because we need a square To turn it into an iTunes album cover.

178
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,364
Speaker 0: Yes I mean we are.

179
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:19,580
Speaker 0: we are looking for art for the top banner and all that but that comes later.

180
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,482
Speaker 1: Well, no is that?

181
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:28,754
Speaker 1: that's also it should look good when it if you go to front row crew comm and you'll see the top Of the page is this blue bar?

182
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:29,780
Speaker 1: That's sort of a gradient.

183
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:32,700
Speaker 1: It should look good against that gradient.

184
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:36,074
Speaker 1: And if it doesn't then if you win, I'll ask you to modify it.

185
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,540
Speaker 1: So it looks good against that grade.

186
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,420
Speaker 0: So don't make your logo a blue gradient.

187
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:44,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I want us because we're gonna stick it right at the top of that page in the blue area.

188
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:48,584
Speaker 1: So it should look good up there And It should.

189
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:55,208
Speaker 1: I'd like it to incorporate geek and night Summit somehow in some fashion.

190
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:59,640
Speaker 0: Yes, if we knew what fashion we wouldn't be having this contest exactly.

191
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,227
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's worst week.

192
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:05,360
Speaker 0: We're going to try to be objective here, which that chance?

193
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,120
Speaker 1: But yeah, this isn't most hated because if it was most hated we'd be like, oh man, do we ever hate that?

194
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sucks.

195
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:15,660
Speaker 1: But the problem is is we might hate it, but it might still be really good.

196
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,725
Speaker 1: We just don't like it.

197
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:22,227
Speaker 1: So this is worst week things that are objectively Terrible either.

198
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:31,040
Speaker 0: and because it's Monday science and tech We really had to narrow it down because if we were just talking about science and tech we'd have things like nuclear weapons.

199
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:39,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you have a really broad definite definition of technology like rim wanted to have yeah I was like, let's talk about razors and nukes and war.

200
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:49,800
Speaker 1: I'm like those things are technically technology If you use a very broad definition, but I'm going to limit it to things that appear on slash dot.

201
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:57,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, so basically consumer technology gadgets computers that sort of thing home electronics software Consumer software.

202
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:06,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, the list we've got so far that we're gonna talk about basically seems to cover Failed technologies and bad technologies which usually go hand-in-hand.

203
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, not always though.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:21,015
Speaker 1: So for example Oracle would not make the list because while we hate Oracle and it's it's pretty bad It's not you know Can widely considered to be this terrible thing and it also has its uses.

205
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:22,480
Speaker 0: my only real complaint is the price.

206
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, if Oracle is free, it'd be pretty good.

207
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:28,660
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's not going to be something you see on worst week.

208
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,532
Speaker 1: Something you will see on worst week is something like tomorrow.

209
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,968
Speaker 1: We'll probably talk about the virtual boy Or the engage.

210
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:38,596
Speaker 1: exactly that's it.

211
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,649
Speaker 1: so Let's talk about worst technologies.

212
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:43,251
Speaker 1: What's the first?

213
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:43,934
Speaker 1: Oh, no, we're not.

214
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:44,737
Speaker 1: we got the news.

215
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,403
Speaker 0: news See.

216
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,840
Speaker 0: now for anyone who doubts the geek nights is recorded live.

217
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,279
Speaker 0: I could have cut that out, but we don't cut anything out of the show anymore at all.

218
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,569
Speaker 0: Yep, like I just wanted to mention that.

219
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:55,895
Speaker 1: Okay, so the news.

220
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:56,900
Speaker 1: oh, oh my news.

221
00:12:57,564 --> 00:13:08,360
Speaker 1: So Skype the thing that lets you you know Talk to other people on the internet and also you can pay money To call other people on the real telephone and receive calls on the real telephone.

222
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,655
Speaker 1: It's called Skype out Skype out and Skype in.

223
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:18,864
Speaker 1: well You're getting free Skype out to anywhere in the US and Canada Until the end of the year.

224
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,990
Speaker 0: free no strings.

225
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:21,753
Speaker 0: No nothing.

226
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,157
Speaker 0: You don't have to do anything.

227
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:24,180
Speaker 0: It's just it's already working.

228
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:25,748
Speaker 1: It's completely non bullshit.

229
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:48,664
Speaker 1: So starting today and ending at no sooner than January 1st, 2007 you can install Skype for free get an account for free and Call on the telephone any phone number in the entire United States and Canada For absolutely free.

230
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:59,520
Speaker 1: So if it's long distance to call your grandma and floor in Florida or your friend who moved to California And you know your cell phone you don't want to use minutes and your regular phone.

231
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,051
Speaker 1: You don't want to pay extra.

232
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:02,300
Speaker 1: just freakin.

233
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:07,900
Speaker 1: Install Skype plug a microphone and a little headset into the computer or whatever.

234
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:10,446
Speaker 1: Type in their number into Skype.

235
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,799
Speaker 1: their phone will ring and BAM free phone call.

236
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,900
Speaker 0: Now because of this we're probably going to really open up to interviews until this ends.

237
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,679
Speaker 0: Yeah interviews with people who don't live nearby.

238
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:29,080
Speaker 0: So in addition to us talking to some guests that we wanted to have on but we haven't really had the means to interview them.

239
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:30,765
Speaker 0: we're also.

240
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:36,579
Speaker 0: if anyone wants to call in about a topic and Talk to us in the forums or in the email and we'll set something up.

241
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:45,680
Speaker 0: I think we should pay for one of those Skype voicemail things I think we should do even though I don't know when he sent us voice feedback via that phone number we have now.

242
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,852
Speaker 1: Well that phone number we have now sucks while it sucks.

243
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:49,595
Speaker 0: No one's used it.

244
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:50,920
Speaker 0: So it doesn't matter if it sucks.

245
00:14:51,780 --> 00:15:00,415
Speaker 0: Alright, everyone just record yourself on your computer with like Windows recorder Yeah, or just talk to us and then we'll have a little live interview.

246
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:06,554
Speaker 0: we thing yeah All right, you know we can probably do it better than pen can on his radio show.

247
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:07,256
Speaker 1: Oh god.

248
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, this thing doesn't work.

249
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:10,708
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's so.

250
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:18,600
Speaker 1: if you don't have Skype already, you know I was a little against Skype earlier because it was made by the same people who made Kazaa, which is all spyware evil.

251
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,250
Speaker 1: But now eBay bought it.

252
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,639
Speaker 1: So Skype is really legitimate.

253
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:30,520
Speaker 0: now It's not evil spyware and even if they ever became spyware There are a lot of geeks watching it constantly and you'll know immediately if they do anything shady.

254
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:32,727
Speaker 1: Yes, Skype is pretty trustworthy.

255
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:38,023
Speaker 1: It works pretty well for what it needs to work as and it's good Using it.

256
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:38,848
Speaker 1: No fear.

257
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,000
Speaker 1: It's now you can make free calls.

258
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,639
Speaker 1: It's obviously this free call thing.

259
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:49,940
Speaker 1: They're obviously just trying to get a whole bunch of people to use it who aren't using it already because now it's so amazing.

260
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:55,025
Speaker 1: And then you know, they'll get them all hooked and then at the end of the year They'll get them all paying next year.

261
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,334
Speaker 1: And I think it's a plan that's gonna work.

262
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:02,675
Speaker 0: that kind of plan works all the time Yeah, get people hooked on something and then now for just five dollars a month.

263
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,660
Speaker 0: You can continue to use it.

264
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,426
Speaker 1: I mean flicker works in the same way.

265
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,233
Speaker 1: You can store a bunch of pictures.

266
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:08,678
Speaker 1: Oh, but only so many.

267
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:10,386
Speaker 1: now You got a if you want it.

268
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:10,869
Speaker 1: All right.

269
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,317
Speaker 1: Yeah, like flicker too much now.

270
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:14,746
Speaker 0: I gotta pay Yeah, but also with a reasonable price.

271
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,311
Speaker 1: Yep, very reasonable price.

272
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:18,780
Speaker 0: So so for a long time.

273
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:37,640
Speaker 0: Well, basically every time a new technology has appeared on the internet that used bandwidth the ISPs have all gotten in a tuft and said oh This technology is going to choke the internet with traffic and crash it and we're gonna need money and we're gonna need all these Things to make the internet not suck if this technology takes off

274
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:38,781
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

275
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,667
Speaker 0: and it's always been bullshit.

276
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:45,100
Speaker 0: They said this about when real media started having like streaming audio.

277
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,920
Speaker 0: They said this is the end of the internet when mp3s appeared.

278
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,987
Speaker 0: This is the end of the internet.

279
00:16:49,168 --> 00:17:07,299
Speaker 0: They've been doing this since the dawn of time and Just today Reuters is carrying a story that the ISPs are saying that if HD content You know video and high-definition video becomes popular on the internet and is watched by many people The internet will collapse under its own weight because of too much traffic.

280
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:15,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, people are already bit torrenting HD videos that are encoded in h.264 and xvid and the internet isn't choking.

281
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:20,339
Speaker 0: Yes, just fine, I mean I see the story and it's not really news to us.

282
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:27,286
Speaker 0: I just wanted to talk about it because for anyone out there who sees this or reads about what's going on with the ISPs right Now it is complete horseshit.

283
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:28,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just lying.

284
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:41,498
Speaker 0: They're lying because they want more money and now Now it's even this separate thing because you know the whole net neutrality thing how they want to like charge Google to use So their customers can get to Google and all that stuff.

285
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:46,011
Speaker 0: This is just an excuse to lobby for that more strongly.

286
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:52,148
Speaker 0: they can go to Congress and say see we're gonna collapse under our own Weight unless Google pays for their share of using Google video.

287
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,192
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah blah blah.

288
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:58,639
Speaker 1: and because Congress doesn't know shit about technology They believe pretty much whatever companies tell them.

289
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:08,945
Speaker 1: so Usually what happens is a Google guy goes to Congress in some committee and ISP guy goes to Congress and they both say and Congress Doesn't know what to think.

290
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:12,340
Speaker 1: so they think whatever they want to think and then bad things happen.

291
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:16,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to sound cynical, but they probably just think whatever.

292
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:21,836
Speaker 0: the guy who gave them the most money says Yep, and if you don't believe me open secrets org.

293
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:29,644
Speaker 0: in places like that You can see exactly which companies have paid which senators and then you can look at their voting records And there's some interesting trends in there.

294
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:30,866
Speaker 1: Oh really?

295
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:50,576
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh Anyone who frequents our forums knows what that song was And anyone who is at our house recently knows what that song is.

296
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:56,100
Speaker 0: now first I'm going to talk about that thing and then I'm going to talk about what happened over the weekend.

297
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:58,908
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is long great.

298
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:03,742
Speaker 1: Am I thinking they will be short if I can get my point across, but that's alright Alright.

299
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:09,140
Speaker 0: so someone posted in our forum this little animated gif thing that apparently had music to it.

300
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,063
Speaker 1: It was a flash.

301
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:16,709
Speaker 0: I think actually yeah, but the thing is I was at work and I didn't have sound so I clicked on it And it was this just animation of a girl spinning a leak.

302
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,380
Speaker 0: a leak for anyone who doesn't know is appliance.

303
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,688
Speaker 1: It's some sort of vegetable that people eat.

304
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,515
Speaker 1: You'll find it in Asian foods and such.

305
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:24,860
Speaker 0: you see it in anime a lot.

306
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:30,400
Speaker 1: It's just like a long white plant with a green tuft at the end kind of like a celery but different.

307
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,669
Speaker 0: Anyway this vid this thing I saw it.

308
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,918
Speaker 0: I thought whatever I didn't know that there was sound to it.

309
00:19:36,863 --> 00:19:39,459
Speaker 0: Then I came home and the link was broken and I thought oh well, whatever.

310
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:48,631
Speaker 0: Fast forward to where someone in fact one of our listeners ugly Fred messaged me and yelled something about spinning leak lady And I didn't really care.

311
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:55,758
Speaker 0: and she expressed Oh, you didn't hear it and I got a link from her to an updated link where I could actually listen to it.

312
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:57,727
Speaker 0: Go watch it.

313
00:19:57,787 --> 00:20:00,661
Speaker 0: It's the most addicting like Creepy.

314
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:02,568
Speaker 0: just it's in my head and it won't go away.

315
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:04,094
Speaker 0: Why won't you stop spinning that leak?

316
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:05,519
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

317
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

318
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:11,380
Speaker 0: And the thing is it took off on the internet like it exploded.

319
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,140
Speaker 0: It's everywhere now and it got to the point where Wikipedia has an article about it.

320
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:23,200
Speaker 0: This is like that There's an article in Wikipedia about everything and now there's an article about it and they even have a link to the forum.

321
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:28,559
Speaker 0: I think the forum is in Finland where this was created and posted the first time.

322
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:36,500
Speaker 0: We're at the point in the world where a meme that appears can be traced back to its exact origin via Wikipedia.

323
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,867
Speaker 0: Yes, it was it's fantastic.

324
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:39,550
Speaker 0: Now.

325
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,494
Speaker 0: I like this thing.

326
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:41,096
Speaker 0: It's really cute.

327
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,040
Speaker 0: People are making more.

328
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:45,779
Speaker 0: I think this is gonna be the next, you know big meme on the internet after the haha guy.

329
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:49,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it a lot more than I like YTM n DS in general.

330
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:55,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is kind of like a YTM n D only it seems higher quality like higher production values.

331
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:56,799
Speaker 0: more thought was put into it.

332
00:20:57,301 --> 00:21:05,090
Speaker 0: I mean someone sat down was watching bleach saw this scene and thought huh Found this silly song stuck him together and made a thing.

333
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:05,592
Speaker 0: Hmm.

334
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:06,796
Speaker 0: That's what the Internet's all about.

335
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:07,419
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

336
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:14,428
Speaker 0: Now as a result of this a lot of people have been looking for this band The band that did the song.

337
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:17,420
Speaker 0: they're a Finnish folk band and their music's really cute cool.

338
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,520
Speaker 0: I can't find torrents of it yet, but I'm really thinking of ordering the albums.

339
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:22,847
Speaker 1: You're nuts.

340
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,335
Speaker 0: I like Finnish folk music.

341
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,200
Speaker 0: now great.

342
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,827
Speaker 0: Now the funny thing is I should.

343
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:31,420
Speaker 0: we showed it to everyone when they came over for the geek end because they hadn't seen it.

344
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,644
Speaker 0: they didn't really pay attention to it in the forums and we put it on the TV and For about two minutes.

345
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:40,655
Speaker 0: We just sat there watching it and no one said a word.

346
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:41,900
Speaker 0: No one wanted to admit.

347
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,359
Speaker 0: Wow, I don't want to stop watching this.

348
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:50,302
Speaker 0: So everyone was just quiet and no one said anything and we watched it like it was a TV show Mm-hmm.

349
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:53,075
Speaker 0: We eventually just someone turned it off and saved us.

350
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:53,618
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

351
00:21:54,404 --> 00:22:02,846
Speaker 0: And then while I was upstairs the next morning I turned it on and then I went and took a shower and I left it on and then we all decided Let's just leave it on all day.

352
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,600
Speaker 0: You could barely hear it in the background downstairs.

353
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:06,183
Speaker 0: Yeah,

354
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:14,779
Speaker 1: I mean at first I was hearing it like in the morning I heard it a whole bunch But then eventually it faded out and then occasionally faded in because and then it faded out

355
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:20,398
Speaker 0: But it was like this low-level slowly driving you insane song playing in the background that you could almost hear.

356
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:20,799
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

357
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:22,094
Speaker 0: Then we forgot about it.

358
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:30,939
Speaker 0: Then our friend Scott Johnson comes over and We hang out we go out and get food We start playing this game and for hours and hours and hours every now and then he'd look up like, huh?

359
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,102
Speaker 0: No, whatever.

360
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,050
Speaker 0: and then finally he looks at all of us.

361
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,214
Speaker 0: He's like guys.

362
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:35,897
Speaker 0: What's that song?

363
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:41,905
Speaker 0: That's playing and We all look at him and we almost explode with laughter Almost like we all have.

364
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:42,667
Speaker 1: we held it in.

365
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:44,092
Speaker 0: somehow we all held it in.

366
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:46,540
Speaker 0: So we're all sitting there like what song?

367
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:48,426
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

368
00:22:48,848 --> 00:22:51,657
Speaker 0: and he's looking around like I hear this thing.

369
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:52,480
Speaker 0: I can't describe it.

370
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,113
Speaker 0: It's like this girl and she's singing but it doesn't it.

371
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:56,976
Speaker 0: and I'm like what is there?

372
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:57,980
Speaker 1: sounds like it's going in a loop.

373
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:00,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, is there a radio going on outside?

374
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:04,844
Speaker 0: and then Scott's like, yeah, maybe something, you know radio driving by Maybe the lady downstairs.

375
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:05,667
Speaker 0: He's like.

376
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:06,670
Speaker 0: no I hear it.

377
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,533
Speaker 0: It's it's looping.

378
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:08,697
Speaker 0: It's been looping for the past hour.

379
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:09,660
Speaker 0: It's the same song.

380
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,667
Speaker 0: Ah, don't you guys hear it?

381
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:13,894
Speaker 0: and we stifled the laughter.

382
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:18,780
Speaker 0: We're like, no, we don't know what you're talking about And after a few minutes that he's like I gotta find it.

383
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,700
Speaker 0: He stands up and starts walking around the house and he's like looking out that he walks out goes out the front door.

384
00:23:24,022 --> 00:23:30,335
Speaker 0: Now while he's standing outside we bust out really And he walks back in really hip.

385
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:32,504
Speaker 0: Did you hear anything?

386
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:37,320
Speaker 0: and he's like no, I think it's in the house and we're like you're crazy.

387
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,243
Speaker 0: We don't hear anything.

388
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:42,800
Speaker 0: and then finally he gets this look on his face and he's like, uh, he runs upstairs.

389
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:44,889
Speaker 0: It's on your goddamn computer room.

390
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,512
Speaker 0: what the hell.

391
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:47,099
Speaker 0: and then we exploded.

392
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,870
Speaker 1: I'm just falling all over myself on the stairs.

393
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:53,179
Speaker 0: We just we were laughing so hard it hurt.

394
00:23:54,207 --> 00:23:54,636
Speaker 1: It was great.

395
00:23:55,302 --> 00:24:02,298
Speaker 0: So the spinning leak to all of you who have not seen it go watch it and I Guarantee the song will be stuck in your head for at least a year.

396
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,771
Speaker 0: Mmm, so Scott do you have a thing of the day?

397
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,353
Speaker 1: I do.

398
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,180
Speaker 1: It's a useful piece of software.

399
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:09,599
Speaker 0: It's actually really cool.

400
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,011
Speaker 0: Don't let my long thing of the day detract from this because this thing is awesome

401
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:24,367
Speaker 1: now if you use Windows, which I think a Lot of you do because not enough of you are smarter cool enough to use Linux and a lot of you are so rich And arty that use apples.

402
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:34,160
Speaker 1: so you Windows users out there Are you the type of Windows user that has I don't know a bajillion icons on your desktop or maybe a giant start menu?

403
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:38,160
Speaker 0: I believe the post pictures of your desktop thread answered that question.

404
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:42,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know some programs in your start menu.

405
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:49,400
Speaker 1: you use them all the time So you usually make little quick launch buttons down in the taskbar, you know, the things you click once and it runs the program.

406
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:51,417
Speaker 1: You know you put Firefox down there and stuff.

407
00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:05,609
Speaker 1: well, I Got tired of my work laptop always having to dig through the start menu for the rarely used application or have a whole billion icons everywhere for the applications that I launched frequently.

408
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:14,049
Speaker 1: and there were some applications where I You know, you don't want them to start up all the time On startup, but you wanted to start up.

409
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:21,300
Speaker 1: sometimes, you know, like if I turn my computer on at work I always want outlook to start up, but if I turn it out at home, I don't want outlook to turn on at all.

410
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:25,056
Speaker 0: Yep, and sometimes I want notes to start, you know Lotus Notes.

411
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:33,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, shoot me now But sometimes I need to actually do work on my computer and I can't deal with Lotus Notes spending its 10 minutes shitting itself Before it actually opens.

412
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:50,040
Speaker 1: So what I needed was an easy way to Launch and Start any Windows application that was installed on the computer without digging through the start menu and without having a billion icons Cluttering up my screen because I need my screen to be clean or else I go insane.

413
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:54,878
Speaker 1: So there's this program called launchy la you and CH.

414
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:55,320
Speaker 1: why?

415
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,266
Speaker 0: Lunchie lunchy lunch.

416
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:00,180
Speaker 1: Yes, it launches launches programs.

417
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:09,880
Speaker 1: Now what you do is first you install launchy and Then you run launchy and launchy runs at startup and you want launchy to always run and start up or else is useless.

418
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:11,749
Speaker 1: What launchy does?

419
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,380
Speaker 1: is you type in a keyboard?

420
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:13,981
Speaker 1: shortcut?

421
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:22,203
Speaker 1: the default keyboard shortcut for launchy is alt space and you would type alt space and launchy will appear.

422
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:30,208
Speaker 1: once launchy appears you can right-click on it and change the skin and Change the hotkey.

423
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:36,430
Speaker 1: So if you don't like alt space you can use control space Which is what I use control alt f7 meta.

424
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,136
Speaker 1: Well, no, you can combine.

425
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:39,180
Speaker 1: you can mine two keys.

426
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:43,839
Speaker 1: So it's like you have control alt shift and Windows key combined with any other key.

427
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:49,860
Speaker 1: So you could be like window L for you know, but even though that locks the screen, but you get the point.

428
00:26:50,902 --> 00:27:03,177
Speaker 1: and what launchy does is it opens up this little window and The window looks like whatever skin you pick and most of the skins are really cool-looking and there's transparent also and you can move it around the screen to wherever you want.

429
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:18,090
Speaker 1: also and In this box you type you could type anything in this box And what it will do is as you type it will search the start menu For the program that most matches what you're typing.

430
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:25,060
Speaker 1: So if I want to start audacity, I type a You and already it knows I want audacity.

431
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,513
Speaker 1: So I press enter and audacity starts up and launchy disappears.

432
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:31,624
Speaker 1: if I want to start Firefox I open up launchy.

433
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:35,396
Speaker 1: I type F. There it is because I use Firefox more than anything else.

434
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,335
Speaker 1: I Go in and I type M. Oh, that's Mozilla Firefox, of course.

435
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:50,939
Speaker 1: I Microsoft Office Outlook It just it looks in your start menu and indexes all the icons and shit that are in there.

436
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,909
Speaker 1: So you don't sue let your start menu become a huge mess.

437
00:27:53,929 --> 00:28:09,454
Speaker 1: You're never gonna go in there again if you have launchy and What you can do is your run launchy and you can get to any thing in your start menu just by typing the name of it and It'll launch between that and the XP eyes test switcher.

438
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,860
Speaker 0: I don't even have a test bar or anything.

439
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,019
Speaker 0: My desktop is just completely empty now at work.

440
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:17,411
Speaker 1: Yep, just use a little launchy guy and you can run any.

441
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:23,859
Speaker 1: you can start any Windows application just by opening launchy With a quick keyboard shortcut and typing in the name of it.

442
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:33,198
Speaker 1: Now this is even better because a lot of the you know Let's say you're a big on the keyboard and you alt tab between running programs and all your programs.

443
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:42,228
Speaker 1: you use you know the keyboard shortcuts for but in Windows you always needed to go and Go down to the start menu or stop.

444
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:45,920
Speaker 1: take your hands off the keyboard to click on something to start a new program.

445
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:55,496
Speaker 1: Sure, you could do window R to get the little run dialog box But even then you need to type the whole path of the executable.

446
00:28:55,516 --> 00:29:00,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not fun Unless you put everything in your path, which is bad.

447
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:00,937
Speaker 1: That's really bad.

448
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:01,800
Speaker 1: You don't want to do that either.

449
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,919
Speaker 1: So launchy is what the run is what start run really should be.

450
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:17,557
Speaker 1: Here's where you type in the name of any program, you know the English make sense name of any program in Windows that's installed on your computer and it's in your start menu and It will start it for you.

451
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:23,219
Speaker 1: So a lot less mouse use a lot more keyboard use a lot more efficiency a lot more coolness.

452
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:26,009
Speaker 1: It makes windows suck a lot less.

453
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,480
Speaker 1: So you should install launchy and the link is at front row crew comm.

454
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,443
Speaker 1: So now you have to go there.

455
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,117
Speaker 0: All right, so worst week worst week.

456
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:41,540
Speaker 0: now once again We're gonna try to be objective here and talk about things from a reasonable non opinionated standpoint.

457
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:44,018
Speaker 1: All right, so you got the list so you.

458
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:46,587
Speaker 0: So we'd like to start with now.

459
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:54,899
Speaker 0: this one's a really complicated one, but we'll qualify it digital television and high-definition television in the United States.

460
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:58,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, well HDTV is pretty much the same everywhere in the world.

461
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,020
Speaker 1: The only difference is that the rest of the world doesn't have it at all at all.

462
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, but well digital television.

463
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,254
Speaker 0: other countries have digital television some of them.

464
00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:07,260
Speaker 1: a lot of them just have satellite television.

465
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:11,435
Speaker 0: Yep, but we're not talking about the idea of high-definition.

466
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,760
Speaker 0: I think high-definition is great.

467
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:15,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing better than HD sports.

468
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:26,559
Speaker 1: they kick the shit out of normal sports Yep, and while eight most video games may not need HD You can do awesome things with HD like split screens that you know where everyone can see what the hell's going on.

469
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:27,705
Speaker 0: So don't get us wrong.

470
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:29,133
Speaker 0: We're not against HD.

471
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:32,958
Speaker 0: HD and Advancing display technology is an awesome thing.

472
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:48,668
Speaker 0: but have you noticed how in America with the HD standards and all that basically every time they bring up an HD thing they With DRM and then they make it obsolete because someone broke it and then they make a new standard and then they cripple it and Then they break it and then nothing works.

473
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:49,673
Speaker 0: and it's so complicated.

474
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,300
Speaker 0: We barely understand it.

475
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,965
Speaker 0: The average Joe has no idea what's going on.

476
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:53,506
Speaker 1: They got 720p 720i 1080i 1080p.

477
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:54,569
Speaker 1: They got different numbers.

478
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,021
Speaker 1: They got different cables TVI HDMI DisplayPort.

479
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:10,107
Speaker 1: they got TVs that are HD ready and they have TVs that are actual HD TVs and they have TVs with digital Receivers without digital receivers.

480
00:31:10,127 --> 00:31:13,040
Speaker 1: they have TVs that only support one format support all the formats.

481
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:20,300
Speaker 0: It's just insane TVs that upsample TVs that can't display content because they don't have the copyright stuff built into them anymore.

482
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:22,437
Speaker 1: Cuz they're old with the HD CP.

483
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:25,006
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just the company.

484
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,420
Speaker 0: It's such a mess that I think the technology is going to fail.

485
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:30,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think what's gonna happen?

486
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:37,451
Speaker 1: My prediction is in a few years HD will eventually coalesce into just one standard.

487
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,816
Speaker 1: It'll be like 1080p.

488
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:49,513
Speaker 1: This is the cable This is the format and all the other HD stuff will either be Sort of half working or not working anymore and they'll be one standard.

489
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:53,084
Speaker 1: and then once they say this is HD This is the end.

490
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:57,180
Speaker 1: then everyone will go out and buy HD stuff when they buy new TVs.

491
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,480
Speaker 0: Yep, and the same goes for HD DVD and blu-ray.

492
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,891
Speaker 1: Yeah, both of those are even worse.

493
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:08,153
Speaker 1: I mean when you add those into the equation We're not just ragging on Sony HD DVD and blu-ray.

494
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:14,419
Speaker 0: both have serious problems And there's gonna be a huge war between them both and I don't think consumers care about either one.

495
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:21,760
Speaker 1: When you read today the some guy got a one of those Toshiba HD DVD players.

496
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,427
Speaker 1: Oh, and you know what it is.

497
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:24,934
Speaker 1: It's just a computer.

498
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:32,699
Speaker 1: It's like a $600 Pentium for computer with a with a HD TV with an HD DVD drive in it.

499
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,526
Speaker 0: great We have enough problems with our crap.

500
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:37,980
Speaker 1: Oh DVD players overheating and it takes forever for the disc to load.

501
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,460
Speaker 1: So basically you put the movie in it and you wait and it's a whole computer and you wait for it.

502
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,787
Speaker 1: It takes forever to boot the thing.

503
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:49,235
Speaker 1: it takes forever for it to load the movie But once the movies loaded it plays an HD movie.

504
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:49,918
Speaker 1: That's what it does.

505
00:32:50,844 --> 00:33:00,040
Speaker 0: That really can't compete with DVD at all Yep, and we could go on and on about how DVD was a big a much bigger leap for consumers than HD DVD is.

506
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:01,080
Speaker 0: But we don't need to get into that.

507
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,600
Speaker 0: The point is that the company's screwed this up by making it complex obtuse and by you know fighting too much.

508
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,787
Speaker 1: You know Sometimes you need competition and sometimes you need a standard.

509
00:33:10,928 --> 00:33:16,122
Speaker 1: competing over the standard doesn't work when all the standards are essentially equal But different.

510
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,792
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean this is worse than beta versus VHS.

511
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,136
Speaker 0: This is just crap.

512
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:22,522
Speaker 1: This is ass Alright.

513
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:26,031
Speaker 0: so digital audio mp3 took off right?

514
00:33:26,473 --> 00:33:29,040
Speaker 0: What about all the formats that socked or failed?

515
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,065
Speaker 1: Like a track or vqf.

516
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to know how old I am.

517
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:37,639
Speaker 0: Does anyone out there know what a vqf file is?

518
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,088
Speaker 0: Because when mp3 came out like once mp3 had mainstream.

519
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:55,429
Speaker 0: vqf appeared like right after and it was higher quality Per bitrate, but it took significantly more processing power to play Mm-hmm as a result because computers were slow.

520
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:58,859
Speaker 0: I have one vqf file to this day that I can still play an XMMS.

521
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:00,487
Speaker 0: I've never seen another one.

522
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:01,714
Speaker 0: I think it's completely dead.

523
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:08,199
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell It just it didn't serve the market at the time it came out and thus it was terrible and worthless.

524
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:15,159
Speaker 1: Yep, even though if it came out more recently, it might have been able to compete with the likes of AAC and such.

525
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, now here's a good one.

526
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:20,331
Speaker 0: This is something that is still useful in the rest of the world.

527
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:25,260
Speaker 0: to a point and it's a thing that was awesome Except for the fact that it was crippled arbitrarily.

528
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,621
Speaker 0: Minidisc.

529
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:27,487
Speaker 0: Mmm.

530
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:29,420
Speaker 0: I know we have a lot of foreign listeners.

531
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:32,976
Speaker 0: So I know Minidisc is used a lot in the rest of the world.

532
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,164
Speaker 1: in Japan It's big.

533
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:35,231
Speaker 0: in the u.s.

534
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:36,440
Speaker 0: Minidisc died.

535
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,005
Speaker 0: Minidisc was a silver.

536
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:41,449
Speaker 1: Minidisc they pushed it and then when I thought it was dead They pushed it a little more.

537
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,760
Speaker 1: and now it's dead.

538
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,040
Speaker 1: And the only time you really see Minidisc is in personal audio recorders.

539
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,159
Speaker 0: But it's horribly crippled with DRM and you have to pay a lot of money to get non crippled Minidisc.

540
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:57,314
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they have crippled Minidisc, which is kind of it's not the greatest.

541
00:34:57,515 --> 00:35:01,091
Speaker 1: and then they have non crippled Minidisc Which is incredibly expensive.

542
00:35:01,372 --> 00:35:02,520
Speaker 0: I mean Minidisc was great.

543
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:09,666
Speaker 0: I knew someone who had a Minidisc player and this was I mean Minidisc came out before it was Widely available.

544
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:12,499
Speaker 0: the ability to burn CDs for yourself Yep.

545
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:19,160
Speaker 1: And that was the advantage of Minidisc was that unlike CDs which at the time you could not record Minidiscs could record.

546
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:20,384
Speaker 1: So it's like aha.

547
00:35:20,424 --> 00:35:22,089
Speaker 1: Minidisc sound as good as CDs.

548
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,780
Speaker 1: They hold almost as much music and you can record to them.

549
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:26,624
Speaker 1: They're great.

550
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:27,228
Speaker 1: They're perfect.

551
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:28,515
Speaker 1: They're most so much better than the CDs.

552
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:29,300
Speaker 1: CDs gonna die.

553
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,975
Speaker 1: They're gonna start selling Minidiscs in the store.

554
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,629
Speaker 0: This will be great Yeah, but then Sony decided wait a minute.

555
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:35,940
Speaker 0: people might pirate our music with this.

556
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,139
Speaker 0: We'd better fuck this format and destroy it.

557
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:41,860
Speaker 1: Well Sony made Minidisc so all they wanted was for it to succeed.

558
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:45,653
Speaker 1: But they also didn't want it to become a super piracy land.

559
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:47,720
Speaker 1: and that's where you get formats like the 8-track.

560
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:51,791
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about 8-track as in the number 8-track.

561
00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:58,252
Speaker 1: That's an old, you know, it came between cassette tapes Yes vinyl records, which we wouldn't call a failure because it was actually widely used.

562
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:04,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking about 8-track ATRAC Which is Sony's proprietary Competitor with.

563
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:23,140
Speaker 1: so basically if Sony had made iTunes instead of Apple making iTunes you wouldn't be using AACs you would be using ATRACs 8-track, which is what you would be all of Sony's Early digital audio players and the digital Minidisc players would only play music in the 8-track format.

564
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:33,096
Speaker 1: So you needed to use Sony's Windows software to convert music to the 8-track format and you could only buy Music from Sony in the 8-track format to play on those things.

565
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:38,733
Speaker 1: and that's why iPod won because it played mp3 and the Sony stuff some of which was.

566
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:45,934
Speaker 1: some of the devices were actually good devices But they failed because they forced you to convert everything to ATRAC which sucks.

567
00:36:46,235 --> 00:36:48,120
Speaker 0: and this is Sony's real main problem.

568
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,719
Speaker 0: Is that Sony is a whole bunch of different companies?

569
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:01,648
Speaker 1: Effectively that have different markets and different products jammed together into one big umbrella company and they mess with each other and what's best for one Company might be bad for another company.

570
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:03,255
Speaker 1: So they don't do it sometimes.

571
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:04,440
Speaker 1: and they do do it sometimes.

572
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:07,780
Speaker 1: So if they do it, they end up hurting another part of the company.

573
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:10,957
Speaker 1: But if they don't do it, they hurt that part of the company that doesn't do it.

574
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:15,514
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, it's basically just the intellectual property wing of Sony at this point.

575
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:17,180
Speaker 0: Yes ones that cripple everything.

576
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:26,655
Speaker 1: Yeah So Sony Records doesn't want you know Sony electronics to make something that allows free recording of sharing of music Sony can make an awesome music sharing recording device.

577
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:27,560
Speaker 1: That's great.

578
00:37:28,143 --> 00:37:31,180
Speaker 1: But if they did that the Sony music part would fail.

579
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:33,729
Speaker 1: But if they don't do it the Sony electronics part fails.

580
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:40,216
Speaker 0: Sony electronics probably didn't want any DRM to be in blu-ray But the rest of Sony wanted the DRM because otherwise that's the end of them.

581
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:42,645
Speaker 1: Yep So that's that's that.

582
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,534
Speaker 0: All right, and along the lines of replacements like that.

583
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,220
Speaker 0: The floppy disk was ubiquitous.

584
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:52,080
Speaker 0: The floppy disk was I mean, it's obsolete now and it was actually fairly unreliable and terrible.

585
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:57,920
Speaker 0: But it was basically the standard of storage for a long time It was the standard for removable storage.

586
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:05,360
Speaker 1: It was really, you know, there was the five and a quarter inch floppy Which was replaced pretty quickly by the three and a half inch floppy, which is much much better.

587
00:38:06,122 --> 00:38:18,740
Speaker 1: But for a long time it was the only media that every computer could handle Which you could read and write to and remove from your computer easily and ship move it around.

588
00:38:19,023 --> 00:38:20,378
Speaker 1: You know between take it with you.

589
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:25,580
Speaker 0: Now a bunch of companies tried to make the successor to the floppy disk.

590
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:28,335
Speaker 1: There's the zip disk which actually almost worked.

591
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:30,746
Speaker 1: The problem was Not enough.

592
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:34,587
Speaker 1: computers had zip disk by default Yeah, so it wasn't ubiquitous.

593
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:37,820
Speaker 0: a lot of people think they saw zip disks a lot because they saw him in universities.

594
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,480
Speaker 0: They weren't really used so much outside of universities.

595
00:38:40,982 --> 00:38:54,283
Speaker 1: Well, there are people like who had lots of digital files people who did photoshopping a lot and such Zip disks, but most people just didn't have a need, you know for zip disks and they were really expensive Which is what hurt them.

596
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:58,480
Speaker 1: you could you would go to the store and you'd buy a friggin box of floppies for 20 bucks.

597
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:03,660
Speaker 1: One zip disk was like 10 bucks and that's why you didn't see people using them like crazy.

598
00:39:03,973 --> 00:39:04,120
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:10,644
Speaker 0: But then there was like LS 120 and all these other great formats that were like a hundred megabytes on a basically three and a quarter Inch floppy disk.

600
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,600
Speaker 1: Yeah that there were drives which could take there.

601
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,153
Speaker 1: They looked like floppy disks three and a half inch floppies, but they weren't.

602
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:18,840
Speaker 1: they had something different inside of them.

603
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:28,040
Speaker 1: they could store a hundred and twenty megabytes instead of one point four four megabytes and The drives that took those things could also take normal floppies.

604
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,204
Speaker 1: So that's a good idea.

605
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:32,917
Speaker 1: if you want people to you know, carry on, you know here.

606
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:33,640
Speaker 1: take this drive.

607
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:41,783
Speaker 1: You can still use floppies But you can also use our new things and they hope that people would use the new things and they almost did if floppy didn't Die soon after.

608
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:42,265
Speaker 0: yep.

609
00:39:42,686 --> 00:39:51,614
Speaker 0: These are just more cases of companies or technologies that come out that are good technology But they cost too much for what they give you at that time.

610
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:55,628
Speaker 0: or they're not good They're not better or the timing is off.

611
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:59,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, or they're just not better enough from what's out there now to justify it.

612
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:09,820
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, because people don't like to upgrade constantly geeks do we like to upgrade the kernel, you know a thousand times a day, but Normal people don't really seem to want to upgrade things constantly.

613
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,640
Speaker 0: They want to buy something and then ten years from now buy a better thing.

614
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:20,604
Speaker 1: they don't want to upgrade unless there is an obvious benefit that you know, they just can't avoid and The price is right.

615
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:29,597
Speaker 1: So it's very easy to upgrade, you know, if there's a huge benefit like look Firefox It's free and there's an a tremendous obvious benefit.

616
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:36,840
Speaker 1: yet It's still just so much effort to get someone to do it because they resist change so much.

617
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:50,420
Speaker 1: Yep, so imagine, you know trying to get someone to change To something that costs money and the benefit is less obvious Or they don't understand the benefit a lot of times the benefit is tremendous.

618
00:40:50,821 --> 00:41:00,587
Speaker 1: But because people don't understand how it will benefit them directly and obviously or because no one tells them how it will benefit them Then they don't care tabs.

619
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:02,914
Speaker 0: I don't need tabs pop-up pop-up blockers.

620
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:03,978
Speaker 0: I can just close them.

621
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:14,660
Speaker 0: Yeah Exactly of course following the lines of technology We're not gonna say Windows or Microsoft because Windows has done a lot of good and it has its purposes.

622
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,432
Speaker 0: And while we may feel it's a certain way about it.

623
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:20,703
Speaker 0: It's definitely not a worse Windows.

624
00:41:20,804 --> 00:41:22,711
Speaker 1: me however is the worst.

625
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:27,106
Speaker 0: that is probably the worst thing Microsoft has ever done.

626
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:38,880
Speaker 1: so after Windows 98 came out they came out with Windows XP and 2000. now the thing was well, no, they can't win Windows 2000 Yep, and that Windows 2000 was supposed to be for business users.

627
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,051
Speaker 1: It ran on the NT kernel not on the win 32 whatever.

628
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:47,223
Speaker 1: So it was like Under the hood.

629
00:41:47,324 --> 00:41:49,652
Speaker 1: It was very different from Windows 98 and Windows 2000 wouldn't run a lot.

630
00:41:52,205 --> 00:42:13,201
Speaker 1: You know It could run a lot of programs that were built for Windows 95. early on there were a lot of things that just didn't work in Windows 2000 Yeah thing and You know, it was a quite a big transition, you know Microsoft with their long backwards compatibility thing Where Windows 3.1 programs still run in Windows XP, but from 98 to 2000?

631
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:18,926
Speaker 0: It was you're really switching platforms completely there and to me I mean it was a great thing to this day.

632
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:22,860
Speaker 0: I consider Windows 2000 to be Microsoft's greatest server offering.

633
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:36,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they wanted Windows 2000 to be for business people and Windows 98 as the second edition to be for Normal people in their homes because it really kind of made sense when you understood how the software worked.

634
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:54,140
Speaker 1: The problem was is Windows 98 was still kind of unstable and slow and Windows 2000 wasn't and all the games worked on Windows 2000. so all the people switched to Windows 2000. now When they were upgrading Windows 2000 they still really had the idea that home users were on a different track.

635
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:56,320
Speaker 1: They weren't supposed to be using Windows 2000.

636
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,753
Speaker 1: So they came up with Windows me which was the next line in.

637
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:01,680
Speaker 1: you know Windows for the home user.

638
00:43:02,562 --> 00:43:08,980
Speaker 1: The problem was Windows me was just Windows 98 with a bunch of shit on it and the shit made it crash all the time.

639
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,804
Speaker 1: It made it useless.

640
00:43:09,864 --> 00:43:10,708
Speaker 1: It made it slow.

641
00:43:10,728 --> 00:43:11,431
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't useful.

642
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:15,528
Speaker 1: It was No one was gonna pay for.

643
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:20,930
Speaker 1: it was security holes like more so than you would expect It was worse than Windows 98 second edition.

644
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,320
Speaker 0: They basically said it was worse than Windows 95.

645
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, they said here upgrade your Windows 98 to something even worse.

646
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:28,820
Speaker 1: when Windows 2000 was sitting there.

647
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,666
Speaker 1: That was better than everything that had already come.

648
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:33,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, because honestly I never used Windows 98.

649
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:35,020
Speaker 1: I used Windows 98.

650
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,516
Speaker 0: I had Windows 95 a I had Windows 95 B and then I had USB didn't you?

651
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:47,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't have any USB 95 B and then I had Windows 98 SE because those are the OEM CDs my dad stole from work.

652
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:49,342
Speaker 1: I Still have them.

653
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:54,440
Speaker 0: I waited in line the day Windows 2000 was released and bought it in the store for two hundred and seventy-nine.

654
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,484
Speaker 1: Now I didn't do that.

655
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:59,100
Speaker 1: I used Windows 98 SE for a while in tandem with Linux also.

656
00:43:59,321 --> 00:44:01,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought Windows 2000 to this day.

657
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:02,915
Speaker 0: I have a legitimate CD key.

658
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:04,280
Speaker 1: Wow awesome.

659
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:05,982
Speaker 0: Alright.

660
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,668
Speaker 0: now along the lines of computers.

661
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:10,819
Speaker 0: We'd like to say a bit about electronic voting and how.

662
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:18,259
Speaker 0: While it could have been done Well, it has turned into probably one of the most horrible things that could have happened to democracy in the United States.

663
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:20,839
Speaker 1: So you've got these voting machines.

664
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:27,123
Speaker 1: we go up in this touchscreen and you touch the name of the guy you want to vote for or a girl you want to Vote for and it.

665
00:44:28,087 --> 00:44:30,355
Speaker 1: if I was gonna make an electronic voting machine.

666
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:31,560
Speaker 1: There are two components.

667
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,545
Speaker 1: Number one it has to count votes correctly.

668
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:42,967
Speaker 0: That's Increment a number.

669
00:44:43,428 --> 00:44:48,803
Speaker 1: making a voting machine that works and counts votes is Incredibly trivial.

670
00:44:48,823 --> 00:44:54,380
Speaker 1: you can make it in Visual Basic with the beginners book on Visual Basic if you knew nothing about programming whatsoever.

671
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:58,199
Speaker 1: It's so brain-dead stupid to write that software now.

672
00:44:58,902 --> 00:45:04,940
Speaker 1: So the only thing it to really worry about when writing a voting machine is in the software because it's very simple.

673
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:06,305
Speaker 1: It's the security.

674
00:45:06,325 --> 00:45:14,273
Speaker 1: so you need the software to be secure so that someone coming up and using the machine Can't force the machine to change the votes in any way.

675
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,240
Speaker 1: then you need the physical security.

676
00:45:16,722 --> 00:45:17,445
Speaker 1: So the machine.

677
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:21,460
Speaker 1: no one can bust into it and mess around with the insides and change all the votes.

678
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:27,460
Speaker 1: The company that was hired to make digital electronic voting machines was devolved.

679
00:45:28,363 --> 00:45:29,526
Speaker 0: They failed on all counts.

680
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:33,218
Speaker 0: The machines are blatantly obviously open and broken.

681
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:42,972
Speaker 1: Yep Well devolved is a company that is expert in making boxes mostly, you know safes Things you can't break into they may like.

682
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:49,500
Speaker 1: if you go into an office building You'll see like the circuit breakers are in a devolved box or a lot of ATM machines or devolved.

683
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,088
Speaker 1: You can't break into them.

684
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,595
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ATM machines.

685
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:58,579
Speaker 1: run windows and crash But that's of course, but the point is is it physically devolved makes things?

686
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:08,340
Speaker 1: Boxes physical boxes that are tough to bust into you need like dynamite and you know They can make it as tough as you want or as weak as you want it, you know, that's their specialty.

687
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:16,257
Speaker 1: Their software on the other hand is that like they just hire some schmucks to write some stupid software and they screw it up royally.

688
00:46:17,729 --> 00:46:19,570
Speaker 1: so You they train.

689
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,254
Speaker 1: they actually did.

690
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:21,280
Speaker 1: this is a video on the internet.

691
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:27,620
Speaker 1: They trained a monkey to go up to a devolved voting machine and enter the debug mode and screw up all the votes.

692
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:38,920
Speaker 0: Yep, and the black box voting is showed over the past several months just more like countless holes that either back doors They're either intentional or just insane that let you do anything you want to the machine.

693
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:42,135
Speaker 0: There's also no physical verification of the votes.

694
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:45,106
Speaker 1: Yep, so It's not printed out.

695
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:46,391
Speaker 1: It's just written to memory.

696
00:46:46,452 --> 00:46:53,900
Speaker 1: So if I go in and I change all the votes There's no way to know that the votes are changed or even if the machine if you say devolved was crooked.

697
00:46:54,262 --> 00:47:00,089
Speaker 0: They could write the machine where I click on Joe Smith and it says you voted for Joe Smith But it counts a vote for Bob Shider.

698
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have no idea what it's doing.

699
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:02,560
Speaker 1: It's all secret.

700
00:47:03,203 --> 00:47:06,500
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not hard to come up with a voting machine that works.

701
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:11,791
Speaker 0: I mean aside from the specific hardware Scott and I and I mean He could write the software in a few days.

702
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:13,180
Speaker 1: I got the software in one day.

703
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I'm talking, you know also testing and and getting vetting it by X.

704
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:20,491
Speaker 1: Okay, we in a week I could have perfect voting machine software and hardware.

705
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:22,740
Speaker 0: wise how hard is it to come up with this concept?

706
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,247
Speaker 0: All right, you got a touchscreen.

707
00:47:24,669 --> 00:47:25,734
Speaker 0: you click on who you want to vote.

708
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:26,840
Speaker 0: It shows their name.

709
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:29,159
Speaker 0: It asks are you sure if you hit yes?

710
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:34,640
Speaker 0: It prints out a receipt behind glass showing your vote in ink your actual vote.

711
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,175
Speaker 0: Then it asks you is the vote on the piece of paper.

712
00:47:37,457 --> 00:47:37,940
Speaker 0: You're correct.

713
00:47:38,428 --> 00:47:38,959
Speaker 0: You say yes.

714
00:47:39,362 --> 00:47:42,718
Speaker 0: It then puts that piece of paper internally into a box that is sealed.

715
00:47:43,422 --> 00:47:46,580
Speaker 0: That way you have a perfect paper trail in case the machine breaks to verify.

716
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:48,627
Speaker 0: Yep, what what's?

717
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:50,173
Speaker 0: how could they not do that?

718
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:51,720
Speaker 0: How could for all the millions of dollars?

719
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,002
Speaker 0: They didn't do that unless they either have a reason not to do that or they're just so incompetent They couldn't.

720
00:47:57,324 --> 00:47:58,248
Speaker 0: there's no alternative.

721
00:47:58,268 --> 00:48:00,820
Speaker 0: They're either evil or incompetent and I really don't know both.

722
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:10,278
Speaker 1: They're both evil and incompetent because if they were just evil and not incompetent Then the machines would look perfect as far as we know and we wouldn't be able to figure out that they were evil.

723
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,900
Speaker 1: yet They would be evil, you know, it's they were incompetent Justin cut.

724
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,566
Speaker 1: Well, they could just be just incompetent.

725
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:19,100
Speaker 1: But yeah, they're either evil and incompetent or just incompetent.

726
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you'd think that evil and incompetent would count.

727
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,093
Speaker 0: cancel each other out.

728
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,778
Speaker 0: But for some reason they seem to amplify.

729
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,219
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, let's move away from computers a bit and all that.

730
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:37,915
Speaker 0: There's a something that I saw in the mid 90s and it's been around for a long time and the news is finally Realizing and reporting that this is crap.

731
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:44,310
Speaker 0: now You know people have been on a kick about like home air filtration and that sort of thing for a long time.

732
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:50,411
Speaker 0: places like sharper image have sold these ionizing air filters and What they do is they ionize the air.

733
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:55,100
Speaker 0: Well, they that they basically pull dust particles out of the air with electricity.

734
00:48:56,241 --> 00:48:57,847
Speaker 0: Now you think oh that'll keep my house clean.

735
00:48:57,867 --> 00:49:03,471
Speaker 0: and a lot of places sold these especially to elders people in houses and they sold Them and you know, Brooke stone type stores.

736
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:08,820
Speaker 0: and as a kid I thought wouldn't I just make a bunch of ozone and you know what?

737
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, it makes a bunch of ozone which for those of you who aren't aware is toxic.

738
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:19,430
Speaker 1: Yep, so these ozone is all cool and it's in the ozone layer because it you know Makes the Sun go away and not give you cancer.

739
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,160
Speaker 0: and it's cool in small quantities because it smells good.

740
00:49:22,401 --> 00:49:25,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it smells like thunderstorm and Nintendo.

741
00:49:25,216 --> 00:49:27,584
Speaker 1: Yep That's a good smell.

742
00:49:27,684 --> 00:49:28,246
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

743
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:32,480
Speaker 1: But in large quantities, like I fill the room with ozone you're gonna die.

744
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:39,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and especially susceptible are the elderly who are the primary market for those sharper image bullshit fests.

745
00:49:41,101 --> 00:49:48,960
Speaker 1: So ionizing air filters one of the worst technologies ever technology that just harms people and guys no benefit It's a poison killer.

746
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:52,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean this is worse than some of the things like magnet bracelets.

747
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:56,264
Speaker 1: sure magnet rate bracelets don't actually heal you They don't do anything.

748
00:49:56,304 --> 00:49:58,474
Speaker 1: They're just bullshit, but they don't hurt you.

749
00:49:58,514 --> 00:50:02,554
Speaker 0: Well, they might hurt you psychologically They might hurt you psychologically and they'll hurt you financially.

750
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:03,760
Speaker 1: They will not hurt you physically.

751
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:06,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, the best are you me can make that they hurt you physically.

752
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:07,836
Speaker 0: is that because you have them?

753
00:50:07,856 --> 00:50:08,960
Speaker 0: you don't seek other treatment?

754
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,783
Speaker 0: But that's very indirect.

755
00:50:10,984 --> 00:50:18,240
Speaker 1: Yes, the ionizing air filter will hurt you financially Psychologically and then physically it will kill you with ozone.

756
00:50:18,301 --> 00:50:20,026
Speaker 0: Hey Scott, you want to buy a poison gas maker.

757
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:25,969
Speaker 1: really a That's great for parties, I'll just stick it in someone else's room.

758
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:29,175
Speaker 0: Great, all right.

759
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:30,559
Speaker 0: So back to computers.

760
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,667
Speaker 0: Does anyone remember Microsoft Bob?

761
00:50:33,687 --> 00:50:35,948
Speaker 1: I remember Microsoft Bob.

762
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:40,190
Speaker 0: Bob was an attempt to make computers accessible to idiots.

763
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:41,556
Speaker 1: It was this.

764
00:50:41,698 --> 00:50:43,190
Speaker 1: it wasn't even an operating system.

765
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:51,945
Speaker 1: It was this piece of software that was called Microsoft Bob and you would run it After you started Windows or maybe set it up to run on Windows startup.

766
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:52,768
Speaker 1: I think it's Windows 3.1, right?

767
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,574
Speaker 0: I believe so.

768
00:50:55,116 --> 00:50:57,105
Speaker 1: and what it did is it showed you it like.

769
00:50:57,186 --> 00:51:00,930
Speaker 1: it turned the desktop From a metaphor into a literal thing.

770
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:12,326
Speaker 1: It showed you this picture of a room with a desk and a bookshelf and all this stuff and this happy smiley face whose name was Microsoft Bob and you would click around the room to make your computer do stuff.

771
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:20,970
Speaker 1: and you could you know, You click on the Rolodex to store your phone numbers and you you know I don't really remember it all too clearly because I only used it in a CompUSA.

772
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,801
Speaker 0: There are lots of websites that will show you in detail.

773
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:26,210
Speaker 0: In fact, there there are Bob software's out there.

774
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,559
Speaker 0: That'll show you what Bob was like.

775
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:28,909
Speaker 0: Yeah search hard enough.

776
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:31,399
Speaker 0: The problem with Bob is one.

777
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:33,410
Speaker 0: it was done really poorly like really poorly.

778
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,664
Speaker 0: It didn't work and it crashed and took up all your machines RAM.

779
00:51:35,745 --> 00:51:36,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't work.

780
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,353
Speaker 1: It crashed.

781
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:39,841
Speaker 1: computers couldn't really handle all the graphics.

782
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:40,604
Speaker 1: It wanted to do.

783
00:51:40,624 --> 00:51:49,430
Speaker 1: it was really Even if you used it and made things brain-dead easy or at least it made things make sense for idiots.

784
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:52,764
Speaker 1: the problem was is it was horribly inefficient.

785
00:51:53,488 --> 00:52:00,230
Speaker 1: if you Kind of knew what you wanted to do with your computer Bob just got in your way and made it harder for you to get your work done.

786
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:08,247
Speaker 0: Bob also prevented you from learning how your computer really worked so you wouldn't really understand how your computer worked because it put this metaphor in front of you instead.

787
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:09,991
Speaker 0: that was so Abstracted.

788
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:20,890
Speaker 0: and the problem is that the metaphor, you know, all right, I'm in my office, but now you get unintended Consequences of that because you think of how you would do something in your office and that's not how you do it on a computer.

789
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:21,986
Speaker 1: Nope, not at all.

790
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:24,715
Speaker 1: so Microsoft Bob failed miserably.

791
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:32,904
Speaker 1: no one bought it and it's a Computer's back in the day like in the in the 90s.

792
00:52:33,084 --> 00:52:37,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a similar Semi-bad thing called Packard Bell Navigator.

793
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:38,220
Speaker 1: Oh, there were.

794
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,266
Speaker 1: there were things for all kinds of computers.

795
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:45,305
Speaker 1: There was a tab works Yeah, which is I think on a lot of compact computers.

796
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:50,900
Speaker 1: and basically all these were Because Windows 3.1 the operating system had the program manager.

797
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:05,994
Speaker 1: and what these things were is they replaced the program manager with some other Interface that was supposedly more efficient, you know user interface wise tab works had all these tabs which made it somewhat easier to use than the program manager, which is Now.

798
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:09,969
Speaker 1: if you go over try to use program manager nowadays You just want to kill yourself God.

799
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:15,148
Speaker 1: But the problem was they were all slow or useless or they had.

800
00:53:15,168 --> 00:53:20,088
Speaker 1: you know They weren't compatible with all the kinds of crazy stuff and they just caused problems.

801
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:26,873
Speaker 1: Though trivia manager did work, even though it was a pain in the ass to use before Windows 95.

802
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:29,604
Speaker 0: You all realize that there was no such thing as a taskbar, right?

803
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:31,030
Speaker 1: There was no taskbar.

804
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,134
Speaker 1: You had program manager.

805
00:53:32,174 --> 00:53:32,555
Speaker 0: that was it.

806
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:38,398
Speaker 1: you had this one icon and you're the program manager and you could minimize things to the real Desktop including program manager.

807
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,186
Speaker 0: Yep, and they minimized as little icons.

808
00:53:40,528 --> 00:53:46,508
Speaker 0: Yep and Program manager if you minimize that all you had was a blank desktop with one icon on it program manager.

809
00:53:46,528 --> 00:53:47,796
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That was it.

810
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:48,887
Speaker 0: That was your computer.

811
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:51,130
Speaker 1: Even before that you had DOS.

812
00:53:51,772 --> 00:53:52,454
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't you?

813
00:53:52,514 --> 00:53:57,449
Speaker 1: actually if you exited Windows you went to DOS because Windows is wasn't an operating system.

814
00:53:57,509 --> 00:54:00,970
Speaker 1: originally It was a program that ran in DOS.

815
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:13,050
Speaker 1: I basically would just type DOS commands for whatever you were doing and it loaded a bunch of like wrapper driver type of things and then other programs could run in Windows, which is running in DOS and DOS.

816
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:25,830
Speaker 1: DOS really wasn't much of an operating system Which is why you were able to run Windows on it because DOS was already so close to the hardware that Windows wasn't very far away from the hardware running on DOS.

817
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:32,818
Speaker 1: In fact Windows now, which isn't running on DOS is probably farther away from the hardware than Windows 3.1 was Alright.

818
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:43,590
Speaker 0: last and least It amazes me how few people I meet in the street know about this because it was big news As far as I can remember and I remember laughing at it failing.

819
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:46,662
Speaker 1: I remember my friend who worked at Circuit City trying to sell it to me.

820
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew someone who bought one.

821
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:52,169
Speaker 0: Whoa, no, he bought it because after it failed as a DVD player.

822
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:54,642
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, his DVD players back then were expensive.

823
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:55,003
Speaker 0: They were.

824
00:54:55,124 --> 00:54:56,189
Speaker 0: we're talking about divics.

825
00:54:57,033 --> 00:54:57,559
Speaker 1: Now you might.

826
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:04,090
Speaker 1: when someone says divics You might be thinking about the video file format that you download from the internet and watch anime with and such.

827
00:55:04,512 --> 00:55:06,140
Speaker 0: I don't know why they named that codec.

828
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,130
Speaker 0: that because it screwed me up for the longest time.

829
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,459
Speaker 1: It screwed me up as long as time.

830
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:11,050
Speaker 1: I was like, why are they calling this divics?

831
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:15,256
Speaker 1: There's already something else called divics that Existed and died.

832
00:55:15,296 --> 00:55:16,340
Speaker 1: you can't calling it.

833
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:18,469
Speaker 1: The same thing is only gonna mean bad things for you.

834
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:19,999
Speaker 0: It's like they didn't even know.

835
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,490
Speaker 1: they must have not known.

836
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:26,190
Speaker 0: I think they didn't know cuz I mean I meet people who are older than me who've never heard of divics yet.

837
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:27,488
Speaker 1: It made big news.

838
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:33,090
Speaker 1: It was very big news and Circuit City had a huge thing because they were like the number one company trying to sell it.

839
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:36,810
Speaker 0: Divics was a semi competitor to DVD.

840
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:41,930
Speaker 0: That had its gimmick was that you buy a divics player and you plug the divics player into a phone line.

841
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:43,373
Speaker 0: You buy.

842
00:55:43,494 --> 00:55:45,020
Speaker 1: did you have to plug it into a phone line?

843
00:55:45,322 --> 00:55:45,904
Speaker 0: I think you had.

844
00:55:45,945 --> 00:55:47,070
Speaker 0: yeah, it had to be able to phone home.

845
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:48,209
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that part.

846
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:52,827
Speaker 0: I think there were some that didn't but I know it had to be able to phone home at some point.

847
00:55:52,868 --> 00:55:55,741
Speaker 0: like occasionally Like once a month you have to plug it into the phone line.

848
00:55:55,761 --> 00:55:57,310
Speaker 0: Let it call back and figure out stuff.

849
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:58,424
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

850
00:55:58,444 --> 00:56:04,433
Speaker 0: all right But you get a divics disk and you buy it and it cost like a dollar or two and it's a movie DVD.

851
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:08,423
Speaker 1: they were like what people don't want to pay $20 for DVDs and they've been paying $10.

852
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:09,466
Speaker 1: or VHS is.

853
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:20,750
Speaker 1: we're gonna make a Divx player which is basically DVD movies But they cost a dollar and that way people will buy a shit ton of these $1 Videos and we'll make a killing off of them.

854
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:22,476
Speaker 0: So you put it in your divx player and you watch it.

855
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:24,443
Speaker 0: right now you've watched it once.

856
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:31,170
Speaker 0: you have to pay The divx company to watch it again like another 50 cents every time you want to watch it.

857
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,346
Speaker 1: So instead of going to Blockbuster or using Netflix you have to mail discs back and forth.

858
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:52,596
Speaker 1: you would go to the store Give put like a dollar in a vending machine or give a dollar to Circuit City get whatever movie you wanted and bring it home And you could keep that forever instead of renting it, but you only got to watch it once and if you wanted to watch it again You would have to pay more money.

859
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,232
Speaker 1: and that way you know like how many DVDs Do you have?

860
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:58,222
Speaker 1: where you paid 20 bucks and you watch it one time?

861
00:56:58,463 --> 00:56:59,448
Speaker 0: How the initial D movie?

862
00:56:59,629 --> 00:56:59,850
Speaker 1: Yeah?

863
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:03,826
Speaker 1: And how many DVDs do you buy once and you watch them 30 times?

864
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:05,472
Speaker 1: You know.

865
00:57:05,492 --> 00:57:18,070
Speaker 1: so their idea was that you buy more DVDs that you watch once then you buy DVDs that you watch 30 times and Therefore using Divx will save you money, and it'll make them a lot of money by giving you Divx.

866
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:22,730
Speaker 0: They had a huge marketing campaign about this, and it was a everywhere was a big deal.

867
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:29,870
Speaker 0: They were pushing it as this is going to be the future and the first thing I thought when I heard it was wow why don't I just hack it so I could buy movies for a dollar?

868
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:32,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what.

869
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:33,182
Speaker 1: why don't I just hack it?

870
00:57:33,303 --> 00:57:33,705
Speaker 1: so um?

871
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:39,900
Speaker 1: I buy the movie, and then I never need to give them money again and it lets me watch the movie forever and ever.

872
00:57:40,303 --> 00:57:48,050
Speaker 0: every geek thought that and Luckily even beyond that the rest of the consumer world just balked at it, and it died almost immediately.

873
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:53,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, they Circuit City really tried to sell these players to people because they were cheaper than DVD players.

874
00:57:53,886 --> 00:57:57,784
Speaker 1: obviously because they had this you Know subscription plan thing going on, but they also.

875
00:57:57,985 --> 00:57:58,850
Speaker 0: they also play DVDs.

876
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:04,198
Speaker 1: They also play DVDs, so Some people bought them and use them as DVD players.

877
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:10,778
Speaker 1: some people you know people didn't really understand the whole Divx thing no matter How much Circuit City employees tried to explain it to them.

878
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:12,964
Speaker 0: Circuit City took a bath like they.

879
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:13,887
Speaker 0: they they didn't.

880
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,432
Speaker 0: they got close to Bankruptcy.

881
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:15,875
Speaker 0: I believe.

882
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:20,376
Speaker 1: over that Circuit City is not doing as well as Best Buy these days even though It's pretty much the same store.

883
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:21,301
Speaker 1: It's a Best Buy.

884
00:58:21,321 --> 00:58:24,845
Speaker 1: I think sells like home appliances and Circuit City does not.

885
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:28,781
Speaker 0: yeah But Circuit City dumped money into this knowing it was gonna succeed.

886
00:58:28,861 --> 00:58:31,890
Speaker 0: the same way Nokia dumped money into the engage knowing it would succeed.

887
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,836
Speaker 1: I'm an engaged tomorrow.

888
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:34,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is it failed.

889
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:40,210
Speaker 0: It's one thing if a company takes a risk on something and and you know accepts that risk like we might lose this money.

890
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:43,178
Speaker 0: They must have assumed that this would succeed.

891
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:46,507
Speaker 0: so when they failed they couldn't really deal with that.

892
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:47,530
Speaker 0: the money was gone.

893
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:53,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was really bad for Circuit City and the technology itself was really bad and everything about it was bad.

894
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:56,248
Speaker 1: It's one of the worst technology things ever.

895
00:58:56,671 --> 00:59:06,177
Speaker 0: The scary thing is as time goes on I could see technology like that being more acceptable to the consumer public Because they're starting to accept DRM more and more.

896
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:12,097
Speaker 0: but if you tried to voice the DRM that is currently in like HDTV To people 10 years ago.

897
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:15,370
Speaker 0: They'd laugh at you spit on you, and then tell you to die in a fire.

898
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:19,870
Speaker 1: Well the thing is people are willing to accept DRM as long as it doesn't get in the way.

899
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:21,355
Speaker 1: So look at Apple.

900
00:59:21,456 --> 00:59:23,283
Speaker 1: Apple has DRM and iTunes right.

901
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:24,327
Speaker 0: you don't even notice it.

902
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:25,090
Speaker 1: You don't notice it.

903
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,253
Speaker 1: It doesn't you never.

904
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:37,357
Speaker 1: you wouldn't know is there if no one told you or unless you tried to really do some crazy stuff The DRM in What has really bad DRM?

905
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,265
Speaker 0: the Sony recording bit?

906
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:40,530
Speaker 0: I'm holding right here in my hand.

907
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:53,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, that really gets in the way because you buy a recording you know device And you want to take the audio from it and put it on your computer But you can't because you need to use Sony special software and Sony special software sucks And then you can't do it with Linux in meter It.

908
00:59:53,973 --> 00:59:58,288
Speaker 1: it starts to get annoying that the DRM is preventing you from doing something you should be able to do.

909
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:04,349
Speaker 1: The Apple iTunes DRM really doesn't prevent you from doing that much that you should be able to do.

910
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:09,428
Speaker 1: You really have to kind of go way out of your way to make it say you can't do that.

911
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,500
Speaker 0: And that's basically it.

912
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:23,330
Speaker 0: I mean we could talk for hours Based on our thinking and trying to remember Technologies in recent years that have been just objectively terrible that weren't already related to anime or video games.

913
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:24,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, this isn't gonna be.

914
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:29,138
Speaker 1: this is gonna probably be the worst Episode in worst week.

915
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,070
Speaker 1: not that it's gonna be bad that it was a bad episode But it it's not gonna be as good as the rest of the week.

916
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:47,448
Speaker 1: So because video game news like the end the game gear failing and the virtual boy The gizmondo power glove yeah, there are so many video game things we can talk a long time about.

917
01:00:47,488 --> 01:00:48,050
Speaker 1: that are CDI.

918
01:00:48,893 --> 01:00:50,670
Speaker 1: There you go Atari.

919
01:00:51,971 --> 01:00:53,075
Speaker 1: Well, not all of Atari.

920
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:53,636
Speaker 1: Atari.

921
01:00:53,656 --> 01:01:03,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the the whole Atari leading into the crash of the gaming industry Yep, but we're just gonna talk about games and consoles and such.

922
01:01:03,405 --> 01:01:18,130
Speaker 1: so yep, Neo Geo Saturn Yeah, so you know I'm sure there's a bunch of horrible technology We missed but that's obvious because we only prepared for like an hour before the episode.

923
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:22,030
Speaker 1: There's no way we could have found all or remembered all the old stuff.

924
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,893
Speaker 1: That was terrible.

925
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:27,330
Speaker 0: plus remember things like favorites week best week worst week our weeks.

926
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:30,910
Speaker 0: We can do again if we really get hard up for content because there's more to talk about.

927
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,983
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think that'll happen for a while though.

928
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,050
Speaker 0: No we got a lot of content.

929
01:01:34,292 --> 01:01:44,112
Speaker 1: So if you've got a horrible technology That was just terrible and you remember it, and we didn't go to the forum with everyone else and we'll go oh, yeah Oh my god.

930
01:01:44,132 --> 01:01:45,436
Speaker 1: We should have talked about that.

931
01:01:45,476 --> 01:01:49,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, holy crap, and if you don't remember Divx don't say anything.

932
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,148
Speaker 0: It'll just make me feel really old.

933
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:56,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, just go on the internet and search for Divx and or on Wikipedia.

934
01:01:56,204 --> 01:01:58,350
Speaker 0: that way you can yeah look on Wikipedia.

935
01:01:58,471 --> 01:02:18,630
Speaker 1: If you just search for Divx you'll find nothing but codex you'll find nothing But the actual good Divx video format, but if you go on Wikipedia You'll find a story about the old crap Divx we're talking about and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
