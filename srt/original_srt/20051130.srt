1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,794
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday November 30th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:18,057
Speaker 0: We talk about anime in the news ADV and the Evangelion movie.

3
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:20,577
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:31,280
Speaker 0: So uh yeah Hillary Clinton is at it again and Lieberman yeah Lieberman and the rest of those those Democrat bastards.

5
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:38,850
Speaker 0: Not that we're pro-republican, but we're kind of anti everyone anti Anyone who anyone has ever heard of.

6
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:41,519
Speaker 1: if we haven't heard of you, then you're probably good.

7
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:45,390
Speaker 0: So pretty much they're backing another one of those.

8
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,816
Speaker 0: get rid of violent video games over the love.

9
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:51,279
Speaker 0: God think of the children laws Gray.

10
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,459
Speaker 0: This law is fantastic.

11
00:00:55,762 --> 00:01:05,660
Speaker 1: So the law basically says that if you are a store You cannot sell M games to minors without getting in trouble.

12
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:16,552
Speaker 1: also, there will be federal inspections of stores to make sure that they're You know not giving games to minors and such.

13
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,719
Speaker 0: so the same way they go after people who give alcohol.

14
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,100
Speaker 0: now They just send a kid in to try to buy an illegal game.

15
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,089
Speaker 1: I imagine I don't know, but it's some sort of auditing.

16
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:39,057
Speaker 1: and then basically you know on the surface you say oh all right Well people can still make M rated games and sell them and whatever but really not so much because this is why Let's say you're Walmart right you have two choices.

17
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:48,140
Speaker 1: you can Submit to these audits and things and you know Only sell M rated games to non-minors.

18
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:49,825
Speaker 1: But then why?

19
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,474
Speaker 1: why go through all the trouble just to sell the M rated games?

20
00:01:52,534 --> 00:02:01,047
Speaker 1: now that you're gonna sell so many fewer copies They're just not gonna sell them which means that if you make an M rated game You're not gonna be able to sell it in as many places.

21
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:06,198
Speaker 1: and sadly Walmart and other places like that are the places where you Get most of your copies sold.

22
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:11,890
Speaker 1: so basically While the law itself you look at it, and you say oh, that's not so bad.

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,472
Speaker 1: It just means that you know stores actually can't sell Really mature things to minors, which is you know it seems kind of okay.

24
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:28,979
Speaker 1: what it really means is well You won't be able to make them because they're so expensive to make and Store because we're gonna hurt the stores so much.

25
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:37,219
Speaker 1: We're basically coercing them in making it not reasonable for them to carry your games Which means you won't make enough money selling them so no one will make them.

26
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:50,119
Speaker 0: the main thing that bothers me about the law is that it gives the FTC the power to review and Audit also how the ESRB does its ratings yep, and basically fiat how they rate things mm-hmm?

27
00:02:50,601 --> 00:03:02,020
Speaker 0: And that all comes out of some study that Clinton keeps bringing up where they basically some stupid family group That doesn't like anyone to see anything bad Decided that the ESRB is terrible.

28
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:07,420
Speaker 0: They give it a grade F And they said that almost every game this really should actually be an AO game and not an M game.

29
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:16,639
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing that really bothers me about this that other people mentioned was okay All right this makes you know even if you want to say this makes sense.

30
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,460
Speaker 1: How come we don't have this for movies?

31
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:22,437
Speaker 1: You know we're gonna say r-rated movies can't be sold to children.

32
00:03:22,457 --> 00:03:31,173
Speaker 1: if Little three-year-olds can walk into any store and buy an r-rated movie on DVD and no one stops and no one cares Yeah, you can't go into the theater and see it even though.

33
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:31,877
Speaker 0: It's not illegal.

34
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,647
Speaker 0: the theaters I remember when I was in high school.

35
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,020
Speaker 0: I went to write it our movies all the time don't even blinked.

36
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:38,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about what about steam?

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,766
Speaker 1: How you gonna make sure that little kids don't buy and I'm ready to game on steam though They're cracking out now.

38
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:47,330
Speaker 0: apparently movie theaters really cracked down And they check ID for a lot of people.

39
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,257
Speaker 0: they won't let you into our rated movies even though.

40
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:49,819
Speaker 0: There's no law.

41
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no law.

42
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:54,696
Speaker 1: the movie rating system has no basis in law.

43
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,303
Speaker 1: It's just through a voluntary Rating system.

44
00:03:57,926 --> 00:03:59,893
Speaker 1: no one is obligated to follow it or anything.

45
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,700
Speaker 1: you're not even obligated to get a rating.

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,262
Speaker 1: You don't have to.

47
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:02,905
Speaker 1: if you don't want to.

48
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:06,038
Speaker 1: you know just movie theaters won't show you and such.

49
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,969
Speaker 1: but You know there's no.

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:17,807
Speaker 1: a little kid can go and buy a freaking triple x-rated book written by scooter Libby on Amazon or Borders and no one so no one check.

51
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:19,594
Speaker 0: actually sometimes people do.

52
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,240
Speaker 0: I have I have a small anecdote.

53
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:23,928
Speaker 0: When I was in middle school, I had a friend.

54
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:27,999
Speaker 0: her name was Sarah, and she was really into those smutty Danielle Steele books.

55
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,110
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know what those are but that's all right either.

56
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,040
Speaker 0: They're they're smutty terrible books.

57
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,988
Speaker 0: Okay, and if anyone out there is offended.

58
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,591
Speaker 0: Well.

59
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,569
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be reading those books, and if you read those books You shouldn't be listening.

60
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,257
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

61
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:47,320
Speaker 0: Okay, but anyway So she we go to the mall to hang out cuz that's what middle school kids did back then before kids were banned from malls.

62
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:56,822
Speaker 0: and She goes into Walden book and tries to buy this Danielle Steele book and the cashier looks at her and says you can't buy that You're not 18.

63
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:58,151
Speaker 1: Did it have a thing on it?

64
00:04:58,272 --> 00:04:59,560
Speaker 1: No was there a sign?

65
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:01,890
Speaker 0: Alright just wouldn't sell it to her.

66
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:05,879
Speaker 0: and we started to raise a stink And then they just kicked us out because we were just punk kids.

67
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:11,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one will stop you from buying an x-rated manga unless you know Taku works at the bookstore.

68
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:12,158
Speaker 1: They don't know the difference.

69
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:17,639
Speaker 0: You know what most of them wouldn't even know because anything that's actually bad is shrink wrapped in plastic.

70
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,360
Speaker 1: anyway I know they'd have to open it to find out that it was bad.

71
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:23,340
Speaker 1: There is a label on a lot of them with some sort of rating.

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,617
Speaker 1: I don't think there's an official system, but I know that like Tokyo pop has their own system.

73
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:35,560
Speaker 1: They kind of self You know regulate things like and they say they say have a letter and then they have a little descriptive words.

74
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,824
Speaker 0: I have my own rating system.

75
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:44,037
Speaker 0: the more angular and thin the characters on the cover are and the more feathers and rose petals there Are the less likely I'm to read it.

76
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:45,706
Speaker 1: You know what.

77
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,699
Speaker 1: that does not coincide with the manga you just bought.

78
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,327
Speaker 1: Well, you just had me five.

79
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:56,716
Speaker 0: is there not that thin on the front and besides the manga I just bought which we'll talk about later is crap and I know it's crap, but it's awesome.

80
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,098
Speaker 0: I love it.

81
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:57,600
Speaker 0: It's crap.

82
00:05:57,743 --> 00:06:03,194
Speaker 1: Okay So video game law on the surface seems like an okay law.

83
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:03,997
Speaker 1: who can argue with?

84
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,415
Speaker 1: you know Not selling the bad games to the miners and making it official.

85
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:14,157
Speaker 1: as to now We're 45% of the time the GameStop will check in reality bad reality bad.

86
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:22,855
Speaker 1: It means people won't make em rated games Which means no games for the people who should and have a right.

87
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:24,580
Speaker 0: and of course the sad reality.

88
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:28,232
Speaker 0: It's quite obvious that I don't know about everyone else involved.

89
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:38,520
Speaker 0: at least Hillary Clinton doesn't care about this issue Probably doesn't even agree with this issue But it's a nice safe issue to make a otherwise Democratic candidate look very pro family values.

90
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:51,582
Speaker 1: Yeah, and of course, you know the way Congress works these days is you know, they make the law and then of course You know the courts overturn it and then people like us go yay court and the people who go boo court the congressman Just go.

91
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:53,069
Speaker 1: Well, I did what I could do.

92
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:59,252
Speaker 1: I can't control those crazy judges Activist judges and not taking responsibility Congress.

93
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:00,235
Speaker 1: That's not gonna get my love.

94
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:05,560
Speaker 0: the term activist judge How dare you use the power given to you by the Constitution of the United States of America?

95
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, good job congressman.

96
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:13,895
Speaker 1: not using any of the power given to you by the Constitution of the United States of America And not listening to your constituents.

97
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:19,019
Speaker 0: one whit They listen to him a little bit spec, yeah a little spec.

98
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:28,163
Speaker 0: Anyway Though kind of doing some other dumb things lately and I normally don't care but this one affects me and it affects me in a Way that sucks.

99
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,133
Speaker 0: I can't get Nyquil anymore.

100
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:30,796
Speaker 0: And neither can you.

101
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:31,620
Speaker 1: you can get Nyquil?

102
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,969
Speaker 1: You just can't get the real deal.

103
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,619
Speaker 0: So it's not Nyquil, is it?

104
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:43,216
Speaker 0: it's something that has a big Q on it and the word letter and and why and It's green or red and it tastes like crap, but it's uh, it's not Nyquil.

105
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:43,939
Speaker 1: I think it's just Nike.

106
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,883
Speaker 0: Yeah Nike.

107
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:54,409
Speaker 0: so for anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the news for the last 20 years There's a big crystal meth problem in the United States.

108
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:02,980
Speaker 1: I don't know such a big problem because if you do crystal meth you're stupid and Making crystal meth is hard and it can kill you in a horrible explosion.

109
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,141
Speaker 1: You

110
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:05,470
Speaker 0: know who makes crystal meth, you know where most meth is made

111
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:06,554
Speaker 1: the middle of the desert

112
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:07,940
Speaker 0: small-town rural America

113
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:08,864
Speaker 1: Sounds right

114
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:19,851
Speaker 0: actually up north like peat town type areas - yeah Because there are people there young people who want to get high but It's hard to get marijuana because marijuana is illegal and

115
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,538
Speaker 1: you can get marijuana in other places in

116
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:21,960
Speaker 0: a city.

117
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,620
Speaker 0: It's hard to get marijuana when you live in a town with a hundred and ninety people in it.

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,964
Speaker 1: You can get in a suburb though.

119
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:27,566
Speaker 0: Yeah.

120
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:32,260
Speaker 0: All right, and they can't really drink because they're not 21.

121
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,607
Speaker 1: Well, you can drink it's not a problem.

122
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,851
Speaker 1: under a drinking is ramp.

123
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:36,152
Speaker 0: Yeah.

124
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they just make meth.

125
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,803
Speaker 1: Well, I guess that works.

126
00:08:41,284 --> 00:09:00,528
Speaker 0: so the Congress and his infinite wisdom in many states has decided instead of you know Dealing with this problem like maybe looking at our drug laws or trying to find other better things for kids to do made laws that made it difficult if not stupid to get anything that contains of Anything that can be used to make crystal meth

127
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:01,471
Speaker 1: pseudo veteran.

128
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:02,876
Speaker 0: Yes, basically pseudo veteran.

129
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:03,740
Speaker 0: a couple other things.

130
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:08,680
Speaker 0: In some states if you want to get a drug like NyQuil you have to go up to the pharmacist.

131
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:10,360
Speaker 0: They take it out from behind the counter.

132
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:11,759
Speaker 0: You have to show two forms of ID.

133
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:18,797
Speaker 0: They take a photocopy of your ID and then they log how much you bought and make you sign it and you can't buy More than a certain amount per year.

134
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,470
Speaker 1: I'm wonder why Vicks didn't do anything about this.

135
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:23,393
Speaker 0: They did.

136
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:28,514
Speaker 0: they took it out of NyQuil Thus not having to have their NyQuil be hidden behind the counters anymore.

137
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:35,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean Shouldn't Vicks be like hey, this is really, you know ruining us.

138
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:39,126
Speaker 1: Maybe we should make you know Push type on it.

139
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:44,570
Speaker 0: this is much easier for them because aside from the few people who read the internet No one's gonna know or care.

140
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:46,079
Speaker 0: They won't even notice.

141
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,874
Speaker 1: Well, apparently oh I see a comment right here.

142
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:51,800
Speaker 1: you ready for this comment?

143
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,383
Speaker 0: I'm ready.

144
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:55,440
Speaker 1: Tylenol cold and flu day/night is your new Savior.

145
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:59,760
Speaker 1: I switched to it a few months ago and it wipes the floor with NyQuil and a quill even the old formulas.

146
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,714
Speaker 1: It's got pseudo veteran in it, too.

147
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:06,633
Speaker 1: Haha And you know, um, oh the second comment don't.

148
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,420
Speaker 1: how am I gonna make my crystal meth now?

149
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Speaker 1: But the thing is okay and some you know We hear these stories about them checking IDs and things.

150
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,608
Speaker 1: I can go to the store by night.

151
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,298
Speaker 1: I can go to the CVS and buy real-deal Sudafed.

152
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:20,945
Speaker 1: right now No one would stop.

153
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:23,415
Speaker 0: We live in New York State where it's not a huge problem.

154
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:24,640
Speaker 1: So why don't they just ship?

155
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,428
Speaker 1: How about this if they I got it?

156
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:27,950
Speaker 1: Here's what you do.

157
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,074
Speaker 1: ready so simple.

158
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:33,884
Speaker 1: You don't have to change the drug laws you don't upset anyone if They're the cops.

159
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:37,040
Speaker 1: find people making crystal meth in an area, right?

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,899
Speaker 1: The drugstores in the area aren't allowed to carry the stuff anymore Until the crystal meth problem is gone from the area.

161
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:46,105
Speaker 0: But you see you don't.

162
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,973
Speaker 0: that just makes it easier to make crystal meth.

163
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:49,259
Speaker 0: You can make it without that stuff.

164
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:54,385
Speaker 1: Oh, well if people are gonna make it without that stuff Then why even bother?

165
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,130
Speaker 0: because that makes it easier.

166
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:59,680
Speaker 0: remember Congress is very good at putting band-aids on problems.

167
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,049
Speaker 0: It's not very good at solving problems.

168
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe they should use, you know their power.

169
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:13,520
Speaker 0: I mean There are a lot of ways you could deal with the crystal meth problem one of which would be make marijuana legal And hopefully they'd smoke something that at least wouldn't eat their brain physically.

170
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:15,839
Speaker 0: Maybe or maybe give kids something to do.

171
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,300
Speaker 0: So instead of wanting to yeah giving kids something to do is the number one because I mean where we live now.

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,756
Speaker 0: There's a mall near us and it doesn't affect us anymore because we're actually adults.

173
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:26,900
Speaker 0: She's kind of scary.

174
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:39,572
Speaker 0: But uh the mall banned anyone under the age of 18 being in the mall Alone or in groups without a parent all weekend Mmm, so kids can't hang out in the mall on weekends.

175
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:41,119
Speaker 1: So what are kids supposed to do?

176
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,319
Speaker 1: Well, their parents yell at him for playing video games for too many hours.

177
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:47,994
Speaker 0: Alright, but they won't let him go outside and run around in the street because it's dangerous.

178
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,260
Speaker 1: Yes, someone will kidnap you.

179
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:55,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't go on this playground because the playground sucks Because I took away the swings and the seesaws.

180
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:56,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

181
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,119
Speaker 1: You know, these are the things you absolutely should never do.

182
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,220
Speaker 1: These are the things that we're gonna stop you from doing because you just won't make them available.

183
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:11,116
Speaker 0: I know there's nothing left except crystal meth yep, and basically the kids just hate to sound old.

184
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,082
Speaker 0: but Really?

185
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:20,164
Speaker 0: It's changed a lot from when I was a kid and I'm sure our parents said the same thing, but god damn Yeah, I was a kid.

186
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:25,400
Speaker 0: I wandered around within about a six mile radius of my house willy-nilly on my little bike.

187
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,066
Speaker 0: I disappear for hours at a time.

188
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:32,202
Speaker 0: I come home with cuts and bruises and gashes and my parents just didn't even notice Mm-hmm.

189
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,129
Speaker 1: I mean it's like, you know everything.

190
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:35,052
Speaker 1: just you know.

191
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:37,762
Speaker 1: changes over time gets worse gets better Who knows.

192
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:40,374
Speaker 1: but there's a line for everything.

193
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:41,600
Speaker 0: When was the last time I got better?

194
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,940
Speaker 0: When was the last time they added something more dangerous to a playground?

195
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:50,100
Speaker 1: When they invented the seesaw and they invented the swirly slide.

196
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:56,240
Speaker 1: In other words not in our life, but the thing about before then there were no swing sets.

197
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:57,624
Speaker 1: There were no playgrounds.

198
00:12:57,665 --> 00:13:01,517
Speaker 0: you realize there have been swing sets since you know, the Industrial Revolution.

199
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:04,150
Speaker 1: if yeah, okay But sure, but what are the 1700s man?

200
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:04,994
Speaker 1: It sucked.

201
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:05,779
Speaker 1: it sucked ass.

202
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:07,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

203
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:14,525
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm a loop of wood and a stick in a 70. if you had a ball you were like a freaking rich dude.

204
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:21,228
Speaker 0: by the time you were 17 you had a wife and five kids work in the farm and You had a gun and you fought in Revolutionary War.

205
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,030
Speaker 0: outstanding.

206
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:25,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it did get better but now it's just getting worse.

207
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:29,327
Speaker 0: people are so afraid of Everything.

208
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:29,934
Speaker 0: it's scary.

209
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:35,640
Speaker 1: See I wouldn't even mind the people being afraid of things just they take their way from here.

210
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I used to have a problem when I was in high school.

211
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:46,800
Speaker 0: I like to go out at night I'd always ride my bike at night or I'd walk over a walk at night or I just wander around at night And I always get harassed by police officers.

212
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:50,259
Speaker 0: They'd stop me and they'd be they say things like what are you doing out?

213
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,103
Speaker 0: Well, are you out at night?

214
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:54,310
Speaker 0: go home and I'd say I'm outside.

215
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:58,374
Speaker 0: Am I not allowed to be outside just because it's dark out.

216
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:03,498
Speaker 0: There's no curfew There's no law and they'd be they just say go home or I'll do something to you.

217
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:05,324
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do?

218
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,313
Speaker 0: I really just laughed and ignored him.

219
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:08,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they couldn't catch me.

220
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,540
Speaker 0: They were fat cops in cars and I was on a bike and I was a young spry kid.

221
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,778
Speaker 1: But even so even if they caught you what are they gonna do?

00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:16,024
Speaker 0: Well, there were.

223

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,085
Speaker 0: different monkeys have different accents and some monkeys make fun of other monkeys They meet who have funny accents.

293
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,072
Speaker 1: Oh, I am the French monkey.

294
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:49,717
Speaker 1: I will fling my French poo at you.

295
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:52,655
Speaker 0: Haha Yeah, something like that.

296
00:18:56,363 --> 00:19:07,519
Speaker 0: But it's actually kind of interesting because they talk about how this gives us a lot of Clues as to how language appeared and evolved in humanity because this is kind of what early human language was probably like.

297
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:11,356
Speaker 0: Yep, that's really all I got to say about that.

298
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,264
Speaker 1: All right, it definitely means that Evolution happened.

299
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,629
Speaker 0: intelligent design is bullshit.

300
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,596
Speaker 0: That is part of it something like that.

301
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,479
Speaker 1: That's good enough.

302
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:25,899
Speaker 1: so This story is a little little tiny bit involved.

303
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:31,080
Speaker 1: There was a guy and he was kind of unhappy because people were speeding through his urban neighborhood.

304
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:33,319
Speaker 0: Did he put a trap in the road?

305
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:35,547
Speaker 1: Well, we're getting to that.

306
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,413
Speaker 0: Okay.

307
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,224
Speaker 0: I haven't read it But he's

308
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:50,513
Speaker 1: I think he's a professor somewhere and as part of his study He tried to find ways to curb the speeding to make people go slower through his neighborhood without Just putting up signs and warnings and fines and things

309
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,860
Speaker 0: I can think of a real good way.

310
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,836
Speaker 0: Well make very lifelike mannequins that look like little kids and toss them in front of speeders cars.

311
00:19:56,856 --> 00:19:59,604
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, no, he like.

312
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,220
Speaker 1: he put an 11-foot high rabbit on the side of the street so people would slow down and look.

313
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:07,193
Speaker 1: He put like a giant bed on the side of the road.

314
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,680
Speaker 1: It says for a sleeping policeman.

315
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:11,124
Speaker 1: I don't know.

316
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:11,947
Speaker 1: I don't know.

317
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,191
Speaker 1: It just says that in parentheses.

318
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:13,993
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

319
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:21,278
Speaker 1: Okay, he put a Fake crash scene on Halloween next to the road speed would rubberneck.

320
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,364
Speaker 0: it Rubberneck is good.

321
00:20:23,685 --> 00:20:26,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, so one day he just set up a living room in the street.

322
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:37,352
Speaker 1: The living room is set up So where he's got like a couch like a table on either side of the couch and a coffee table in front of it Is that like a plant and some magazines.

323
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:48,215
Speaker 1: and then he's got a rug and then across from the rug there's a long kind of table with a TV on it and you know a little stand.

324
00:20:48,275 --> 00:21:01,260
Speaker 1: and He's got this whole living room set up in the middle of the street and there's enough room on the rug for a car to Drive through this little living room in between him and the TV, you know, there's like five Monty Python sketches about that.

325
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,986
Speaker 1: Yep, there probably are.

326
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:06,280
Speaker 1: I think it's actually in Britain too, which is why it's funny.

327
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:08,128
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oxford.

328
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:08,611
Speaker 1: There you go.

329
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:26,639
Speaker 1: So Basically he noticed that you know the men who drove down the road to be kind of girl and go on but the women were like crazy girl Really and like one guy like an SUV even like bumped into his stuff and you know, it wasn't good.

330
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:47,512
Speaker 1: But You know, it's it's pretty cool because the idea is like, you know, hey the street, you know Right now in urban environments across the Western world It's like the street is the domain of cars and basically the whole city is the domain of cars and he's like, you know He's kind of like taking it back saying hey cars are just here.

331
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,135
Speaker 1: This is you know people it's a place for people kind of you know.

332
00:21:54,722 --> 00:22:00,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can say if you're real nice they didn't allow cars in New York City It didn't allow cars at all.

333
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:00,875
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,837
Speaker 1: Yeah How would they deliver goods?

335
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,589
Speaker 0: Trucks are allowed.

336
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:13,436
Speaker 1: Okay But all right What if you need to get somewhere across town and there's no cross town subway because there is?

337
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:17,193
Speaker 0: I think it's obvious that I was Not actually advocating the removal of cars from New York City.

338
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:17,876
Speaker 1: That's good.

339
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:18,720
Speaker 0: I was being facetious.

340
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:24,523
Speaker 0: feces just Was not funny.

341
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,047
Speaker 1: I never thought of it before.

342
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,029
Speaker 1: so I had to let it out.

343
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:29,655
Speaker 1: I had to let out the feces.

344
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:33,723
Speaker 1: I Couldn't the feces in any longer.

345
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:34,605
Speaker 1: Yeah.

346
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,549
Speaker 1: I mean this is the first time they appeared.

347
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,963
Speaker 0: they they had to Exo, uh, what do you say?

348
00:22:40,003 --> 00:22:43,029
Speaker 0: we have Thursdays because we're still talking about what to do on Thursdays.

349
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:43,770

Speaker 0: poop jokes.

354
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,459

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,149
Speaker 1: Anal jokes any jokes involving the rear end and not.

356
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,860
Speaker 1: uh, they can involve the front end as long as they also involve the rear end.

357
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,029
Speaker 1: Just we'll call it the rear.

358
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,198
Speaker 1: It's it's the end of the week.

359
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:07,130
Speaker 1: So we make jokes about the end of your of your body.

360
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,740
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised if some morning zoo show didn't already have that exact bit.

361
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:14,740
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the bit is taken and I'm pretty sure there's no poop joke.

362
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,683
Speaker 1: We can come up with that.

363
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:17,488
Speaker 1: Someone else is already not heard.

364
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,571
Speaker 0: Nah, nah.

365
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:25,204
Speaker 0: Nah, so a rabbi and a piece of poop walk into a bar and I Figure.

366
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:32,440
Speaker 0: that's enough No Anyway, so, uh, it's time for the main bit.

367
00:23:33,783 --> 00:23:36,160
Speaker 0: In the main event, there should be music here.

368
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:45,091
Speaker 1: we really got it and it's even the crappiest crap podcasts have like Bumpering music and intro music.

369
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:46,279
Speaker 1: I don't know where the hell they get it from.

370
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,559
Speaker 0: See, I think a lot of people just take copyrighted music and use it.

371
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,328
Speaker 1: It doesn't sound like I already music to me.

372
00:23:52,468 --> 00:24:00,072
Speaker 0: see you say that but I played a whole bunch of classical jazz for you And you hadn't heard or recognized a single one of them.

373
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,115
Speaker 0: I don't know.

374
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:02,740
Speaker 1: I have to go do some research into it.

375
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:04,851
Speaker 1: I'm gonna maybe email some people tomorrow.

376
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:05,354
Speaker 0: Actually.

377
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:06,419
Speaker 0: I got a couple of friends at RIT.

378
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,015
Speaker 0: I think we'll ask them to do some geeky guitar riffs for us.

379
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:10,980
Speaker 0: We'll just use guitar riffs.

380
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,643
Speaker 1: That could work.

381
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,693
Speaker 1: if we had a synthesizer we could do it too.

382
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:14,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could just be like.

383
00:24:17,464 --> 00:24:21,477
Speaker 0: I like guitar riffs an actual guitar like an acoustic guitar even and whatever.

384
00:24:21,698 --> 00:24:22,220
Speaker 1: it's all say.

385
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:25,049
Speaker 0: But it's anime manga comics day.

386
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:30,489
Speaker 0: All right, and there's a lot of not a lot But the quality of it is very high.

387
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,394
Speaker 0: anime news.

388
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:44,264
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Basically fortune magazine went and did some sort of super interview of I don't know Many many pages on The guy who runs a TV.

389
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:49,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, and of course the summary is that anime is extremely lucrative now.

390
00:24:50,622 --> 00:25:01,100
Speaker 1: And the people who the American anime companies are super smart and the other companies not so smart Yeah, yeah, but namely the movie companies and other media.

391
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:02,302
Speaker 0: Hmm.

392
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:06,179
Speaker 0: Let's see MPAA sues anyone who uploads or downloads anything.

393
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:11,040
Speaker 1: Anime fan subs are just fine as long as you take them off before.

394
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,098
Speaker 1: You know, we put it out and you know what they all take them off.

395
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:16,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can still find it out there.

396
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:17,192
Speaker 1: You guys don't find it.

397
00:25:17,252 --> 00:25:19,120
Speaker 1: But I mean anime ski the fat.

398
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,117
Speaker 1: I mean think about it.

399
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,760
Speaker 1: No one with a bit torrent of movies site right like puts movies out and then when the movies release takes them all off.

400
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:31,961
Speaker 1: right Anime ski, it's like not gonna parents It's licensed.

401
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:37,490
Speaker 0: take them up, even though you can find the torrents to any anime you want pretty much any time.

402
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:47,679
Speaker 1: Somehow the anime still sells a lot Yep, it's like hey, we bought freaking FMA and you also downloaded it.

403
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I watched all of FMA and now you're probably gonna buy it.

404
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,220
Speaker 0: Yep sells.

405
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,538
Speaker 1: But the point is this a TV guy.

406
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:05,979
Speaker 1: They talk about how he's cool like that and how the company doesn't do dumb things and you know They know their audience and they get to know their audience by hanging out with them.

407
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:08,720
Speaker 0: Was he the one who had the fanboy knock on his door?

408
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,760
Speaker 1: He had a fanboy knock on his door talking about Ava, right?

409
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,035
Speaker 0: It was like late at night and this fanboy apparently knocks on his door.

410
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:16,477
Speaker 1: He was early in the morning I don't know.

411
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:23,025
Speaker 0: It was some off-hour and this fanboy just wanted to say that he didn't like the end of Ava And the guy was like.

412
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:23,710
Speaker 1: I didn't make it.

413
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:24,696
Speaker 1: I just brought it here.

414
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:25,300
Speaker 1: Leave me alone.

415
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:31,999
Speaker 1: Needless to say now the a TV guy lives in like a gated community with an alarm system and a gun.

416
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:39,840
Speaker 1: but You know The main point is that you know, you can't go up to like a movie producer and talk about movies.

417
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,068
Speaker 1: So he would know what's good and what's not.

418
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:47,812
Speaker 1: but the anime companies are really connected with their customers And that's why they please their customers so much.

419
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:48,375
Speaker 0: Yeah.

420
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:49,240
Speaker 0: Well, that's definitely true.

421
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,091
Speaker 0: They spend a lot of money on just finding out what's going on.

422
00:26:52,251 --> 00:27:20,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I speak at all those anime cons Like I said on the club summit and I do all that like Otakon and everything and I get to meet a lot of the club advocates or the like Convention advocates from the big anime companies and basically these people are paid paid very well Mind you to pretty much go to every anime convention talk to people make friends have fun and just figure out the word of mouth of what's popular and what isn't and what they should License and what's doing.

423
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,736
Speaker 0: well and all that stuff.

424
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:27,618
Speaker 1: Yep They mean think about imagine if they got rid of all fan subs, right because they thought it was piracy.

425
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,940
Speaker 1: and Imagine if they just you know, they were just a business and they didn't talk to the fans or anything.

426
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,760
Speaker 1: How would they know which anime series to show?

427
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,799
Speaker 1: Well, they could go by the Japanese numbers.

428
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:41,613
Speaker 1: But then something like Trigun would never get over here because no one in Japan watched that.

429
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:44,403
Speaker 0: but it's crazy popular here or even big Oh big.

430
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:48,924
Speaker 0: Oh flopped terribly in Japan and it did super well in the US It was also.

431
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:49,829
Speaker 1: that was also kind of.

432
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,162
Speaker 1: it was a different show was kind of made for u.s Japan's.

433
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:55,520
Speaker 1: I'm a little bit simultaneous and a cowboy bebop didn't do that.

434
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,780
Speaker 1: Well at first not at first but that made it crazy popular in like countries like Italy and such.

435
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:01,787
Speaker 1: yeah, so it was.

436
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:14,192
Speaker 0: it was a different story, but it's an example of an industry that cares about doing what it does well and cares about making money and isn't afraid to Ask for help and find out what they should really be doing.

437
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,120
Speaker 0: Yeah or make changes if necessary.

438
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:18,417
Speaker 1: You mean you look at something like, you know Naruto.

439
00:28:18,498 --> 00:28:25,824
Speaker 1: freakin Anime companies didn't find out about Naruto what you know, some kids found out about it sort of fans Something it like crazy.

440
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:29,539
Speaker 1: and then the anime company saw there was crazy Naruto action going on.

441
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:33,000
Speaker 1: So then it got on to Cartoon Network and then BAM craziness.

442
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:41,140
Speaker 1: There goes, you know movie companies don't sit around, you know talking to fans they kind of shun fans.

443
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:45,489
Speaker 1: You know, they're like get away from us We're making movies.

444
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:53,295
Speaker 0: plus in some ways the American anime distributors are Doing things in a much smarter way than the original Japanese companies that made the anime.

445
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,640
Speaker 1: that is very true.

446
00:28:54,660 --> 00:29:05,188
Speaker 1: But that's because a lot of Japanese companies Not only go by, you know capitalism of you know do things to compete and get more money, but they have other factors like

447
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:06,370
Speaker 0: pride

448
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,930
Speaker 1: and Old-fashioned like, you know, just yeah, we take these are the values we stand by these things period.

449
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,999
Speaker 1: We don't even have reasons for them or anything But they have such problems like DVDs.

450
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,409
Speaker 0: Japan cost about twice as much as DVDs here.

451
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:35,870
Speaker 0: so now there's a big problem in Japan whereby Anime will come out on DVD in Japan and a lot of people don't buy it and they wait and then when it comes out in the US They re-import the US version because it also has the Japanese audio on it and it's half the price.

452
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:41,810
Speaker 1: Gee, maybe uh, you know if you want globalization and free trade, that's what you have to deal with.

453
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,396
Speaker 1: It's a global market.

454
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:46,830
Speaker 1: You can't have these artificial separate markets in separate countries.

455
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,836
Speaker 1: Haha, I'm using capitalism.

456
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:55,810
Speaker 1: you want to sell something you have to sell it to everyone in the world at the same price Yeah, or else you're just gonna be competing with yourself.

457
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,536
Speaker 0: But instead they do silly things like.

458
00:29:57,556 --> 00:30:02,375
Speaker 0: didn't you ever wonder why it takes so long for a show this license to get released In the US?

459
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,430
Speaker 0: it's not because it takes that long to dub it.

460
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,950
Speaker 1: People fans sub these things overnight.

461
00:30:08,295 --> 00:30:10,624
Speaker 0: Every single anime company with rare exceptions.

462
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:22,427
Speaker 0: when they license the show They always put a stipulation in the contract that it will not be released for X months Thus ensuring that in a lot of people who want it in Japan will be forced to buy the Japanese one and they can't wait And then buy the American one.

463
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:29,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even understand like it's good that we have it the way it is because the American companies do good things for us.

464
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:33,170
Speaker 1: But if the Japanese companies didn't suck they could just do it themselves.

465
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:37,730
Speaker 1: Because I mean think about it they all they get out of the deal is the money for the license.

466
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:38,868
Speaker 1: They don't get anything else.

467
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:44,730
Speaker 1: And if the American companies are profiting that means that they're making more money offs using the license.

468
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:47,455
Speaker 0: Then they're paying for the license I in many cases they wouldn't have.

469
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,302
Speaker 0: they wouldn't have to hire Americans and dub it.

470
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:53,304
Speaker 0: because a while I like dubs I I can't.

471
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:53,870
Speaker 0: I gotta be a fan.

472
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:59,690
Speaker 0: I'm not really fanboy, but most dubs suck and most people who like anime actually prefer the subtitles for a lot of reasons.

473
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least the super fans, you know, yeah dub it if you're gonna put it on TV.

474
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:08,110
Speaker 0: Remember the shitstorm that erupted from the fans of initial D when they saw that dub?

475
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:10,878
Speaker 1: Well, that's because that they just twisted the whole show around.

476
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:14,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tokyo pop apologized for that and hasn't done it since.

477
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now Fox bot is doing that to one piece.

478
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:26,474
Speaker 0: Oh great actually what they're doing to one piece is worse than what was done to anything ever with the possible exception of Nausicaa.

479
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:27,427
Speaker 0: eskaflowney TV.

480
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:30,729
Speaker 0: Are you familiar with warriors of the wind?

481
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, but are you familiar with the eskaflowney that was on Fox?

482
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,889
Speaker 0: Actually, I have a friend and she's wonderful and awesome.

483
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:47,965
Speaker 0: But the first several episodes of eskaflowney that she saw she saw on Fox God and one time She asked me if if it was any different and I almost cried.

484
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:48,969
Speaker 0: I didn't know what to say.

485
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,203
Speaker 0: Yes, yes, it's different.

486
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:57,461
Speaker 0: It's not even close Not even close but at least the plot was almost the same.

487
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:04,844
Speaker 0: warriors of the wind took footage from an anime Rearranged it and then dubbed over it and made a completely different movie.

488
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:09,478
Speaker 1: I'm a robo-tech a robo-tech Taking you know, let's see.

489
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:10,846
Speaker 1: they took three animes.

490
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:15,059
Speaker 1: they took Macross one of the greatest animes there is.

491
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:36,169
Speaker 1: they took Southern Cross, which I've never actually seen and they took Genesis rider MOS PETA the thing with the people have wheels on their back ah, and they put them in order and they remixed them and redubbed them with this story of proto culture throughout all three of them and That didn't exist in two of the shows.

492
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:43,630
Speaker 1: And they made a new show and they called it robo-tech and people liked it because they had didn't realize what was going on.

493
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:46,963
Speaker 0: Or early on when companies were picked something up like Sailor Moon.

494
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:52,330
Speaker 0: They're like, alright, we can show this to kids We'll just dub out all these bad things and then they try to get the second season.

495
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,722
Speaker 0: They're like, wait a minute that a lesbian there That girl just gets shot.

496
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:59,195
Speaker 0: Ah Crap, you know.

497
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:03,530
Speaker 1: a TV however is smart unlike those other companies and they know what the real deal is.

498
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,959
Speaker 1: And so there's some other companies letting.

499
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,449
Speaker 1: viz knows what the real deal is.

500
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:11,487
Speaker 1: You know despite not getting the best animes, I think CPM and them know what the real deal.

501
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:14,417
Speaker 1: and I Bandai definitely knows the real deal is.

502
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:20,860
Speaker 1: but band I think is is not quite the same because that's actually a Japanese Company, yeah doing it but they do it.

503
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,427
Speaker 0: Well, yes, very well.

504
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:24,517
Speaker 1: They do it Well, you know they.

505
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:29,065
Speaker 1: in fact if you if you actually go take a look at your DVDs well genie on knows what's up to.

506
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:35,690
Speaker 1: but Go take a look at your DVDs or your your manga or whatever and look look where the bandai is at.

507
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:39,430
Speaker 1: And I'm betting if you have good taste, you'll see more bandai than you realize.

508
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:46,990
Speaker 1: Like there was a poll which American anime DVD company is the best and I was like, huh?

509
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:50,063
Speaker 1: I don't really have loyalty to any of them.

510
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:51,569
Speaker 1: I just have loyalty to shows.

511
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:56,085
Speaker 1: So I look to see which shows are my favorites in which companies they came from.

512
00:33:56,085 --> 00:34:00,900
Speaker 1: 80% of her bandai It's just bandai bandai bandai bandai gundams all bandai.

513
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, how we bebop bandai eska flown a bandai Reagan.

514
00:34:06,774 --> 00:34:14,319
Speaker 1: almost everything was bandai and I was like well Yeah, I guess that's an easy choice.

515
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:19,167
Speaker 1: not to say that no one else has any good shows You know because that's far from the truth.

516
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:22,534
Speaker 1: But yeah Well some company.

517
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:32,400
Speaker 1: well, even even the crap crap companies like CPM I have like one or two movies or something like that that they got, you know There are very few anime companies that have nothing.

518
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,607
Speaker 1: I Think there is zero that have nothing.

519
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,902
Speaker 0: Well, Fox bot has nothing because what they did to one piece is not.

520
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:41,266
Speaker 1: that's not an anime company.

521
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:44,678
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, actually it's kind of scary.

522
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:45,962
Speaker 1: the the way that works is.

523
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:49,594
Speaker 1: there's a company called Viz, you know, this is good Viz.

524
00:34:49,976 --> 00:34:51,243
Speaker 1: this is other company.

525
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:51,705
Speaker 1: They're with.

526
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:52,650
Speaker 1: I forget the name of it.

527
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,652
Speaker 1: I wish I remembered it.

528
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:58,408
Speaker 1: that does like the TV stuff, right, but it's actually combo with Viz.

529
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,215
Speaker 1: somehow I forget the exact.

530
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:11,940
Speaker 1: it's a weird company arrangement that I don't know the details of but That's where all the things like card captors soccer And things like that go through to get on TV.

531
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,870
Speaker 1: And that's that's the part that screws everything up on Fox.

532
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:21,970
Speaker 0: You know, what really screws it up is trying to put anime on TV because American TV networks don't like that sort of thing at all.

533
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:24,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't like the idea of a cartoon.

534
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:27,210
Speaker 0: that might not be for little tiny kids.

535
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:28,876
Speaker 1: Or you know what they do like.

536
00:35:28,976 --> 00:35:32,390
Speaker 1: they do like the idea of having a cartoon without having to pay to make one.

537
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:36,048
Speaker 1: They do like that and they like the fact that hey people watch it.

538
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,114
Speaker 1: You know That's all they really want.

539
00:35:39,174 --> 00:35:40,880
Speaker 1: is they need a cartoon to put?

540
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,099
Speaker 1: because the only reason they want a cartoon is that they can put Advertisers for toys in the cartoon.

541
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,865
Speaker 1: I don't care what the cartoon is.

542
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:52,963
Speaker 0: as long as more little kids Look at it helps if the cartoon is about a toy that they can then sell.

543
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:54,027
Speaker 0: Yep transformers.

544
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:54,990
Speaker 1: That was like the dream.

545
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:58,041
Speaker 1: It's even better if they don't have to pay to make the cartoon.

546
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:59,950
Speaker 1: They can just buy a cartoon that's already made.

547
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,846
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's why do you see the anime on the little kids shows and that's why.

548
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:16,456
Speaker 1: but you know, you see Adult Swim Alright, so the the other great thing that I found out in this article with the ATV guy is I found out the real deal With the the live-action Evangelion movie.

549
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:17,401
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

550
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:27,004
Speaker 1: I've been waiting for that to come out forever I don't know not so much forever at least a year whatever the the story is is that it's not some you know Japanese some person making it.

551
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:38,199
Speaker 1: it's this ATV guy wants to make this movie and the reason he wants to make this movie is because More people bother him about Evangelion than anything else.

552
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,529
Speaker 1: fanboys came to his door to complain about it.

553
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:44,078
Speaker 0: Well, even though he didn't make more series.

554
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:49,778
Speaker 0: I mean in Japan when the show first ended There were almost many riots.

555
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,503
Speaker 0: Yep, people went nuts.

556
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:53,148
Speaker 1: Well, it says here.

557
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:53,730
Speaker 1: There's a quote.

558
00:36:54,231 --> 00:37:03,326
Speaker 1: Fortune says that Evangelion is to anime fans as Star Trek is to Trekkies and I'm like, alright It's not a perfect analogy cuz starred Trekkies don't like anything else.

559
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:08,882
Speaker 1: Yeah Some do some do but you know, but that's like whatever.

560
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:14,622
Speaker 1: the thing is is that The ATV guy wants to make it so that he can make a bunch of money.

561
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm making a live-action Ava.

562
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:21,810
Speaker 1: So he's got in touch with the computer where the digital guys who did the Lord of the Rings?

563
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:33,483
Speaker 1: CG stuff, right and Apparently those weta digital guys They get about 25 emails about this live-action Ava movie.

564
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:40,430
Speaker 1: to every one email they get about Lord of the Rings This movie that isn't even made yet the movie that isn't even made yet.

565
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,779
Speaker 1: The guy's trying to raise money to make the movie first.

566
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,469
Speaker 1: He's got about a hundred million already gotten.

567
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,357
Speaker 0: Is there any way we can get in on this?

568
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:50,270
Speaker 0: I'd invest cuz I think this thing is gonna make a pile of money.

569
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,849
Speaker 0: You can give the guy money, but will I get money back?

570
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,378
Speaker 1: Write him an email.

571
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:57,644
Speaker 0: I showed you like I'll invest.

572
00:37:57,784 --> 00:37:58,427
Speaker 0: I'll give you like 500 bucks.

573
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,889
Speaker 1: I think he's looking for millions though not think about it.

574
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:16,149
Speaker 0: what if he took up a thing where he let fans invest like say make the minimum five hundred dollars or $500 increments and pay back a set dividend based on how well it does and I think a lot of fans would jump on that chance to get the rest of the money he needed?

575
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:17,534
Speaker 1: Maybe?

576
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:30,061
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty much a sure investment anyway, so basically the guy went to the San Diego Comic Con where all the nerds are hanging out right and He was talking to some people trying to raise money for the movie.

577
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:46,009
Speaker 1: right and a guy who's gonna sit down with this guy and Before they could sit down some fan recognized him and came up to him and he said, you know He didn't ask him about anything except he asked him about Ava.

578
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:50,610
Speaker 1: so The guy who's trying to raise money for the movie?

579
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:58,623
Speaker 1: Turns to the to the producer next to him that you know He was trying to get money or whatever from and he says this is why we have to do this movie.

580
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:03,617
Speaker 1: I Just basically he's got two feet.

581
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:14,248
Speaker 0: He's got two serious Ava fanboys on the job and That's probably a good thing because while fanboys are fanboys They know their stuff and they know what makes a show like that.

582
00:39:14,469 --> 00:39:17,179
Speaker 1: Yep so he's these people.

583
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:27,909
Speaker 1: anything they work on has to be cleared by these fanboys and He's invested money's gonna make a live-action Evangelion movie I guess in English and Hope it not sucks.

584
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:35,496
Speaker 0: Yeah I I really got a lot of hope because Ava was fantastic and the only thing I worry is that they're gonna have to cut A lot out.

585
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,389
Speaker 0: so I wonder how they're gonna pace it.

586
00:39:37,971 --> 00:39:38,894
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if it's.

587
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:39,717
Speaker 1: is it gonna be a?

588
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:40,961
Speaker 1: they didn't even say.

589
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:46,922
Speaker 0: is it gonna be a summary movie or will it Just be like the end or will it skip it?

590
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:47,283
Speaker 1: You know what?

591
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:48,227
Speaker 1: I know what it'll have.

592
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:52,000
Speaker 1: It'll have Giant robots have some giant robots awesome angst.

593
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,870
Speaker 1: They'll have some aliens and you'll have some crazy ass ending.

594
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll also have girls in plug suits.

595
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, it will.

596
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:00,794
Speaker 1: And that's what it's gonna be.

597
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:08,568
Speaker 0: or maybe he'll make it like he'll make one and it'll actually just be like the first five Episodes of Ava and then it'll be like, all right, I need more money.

598
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:16,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then see I Don't know if you want to go that path because what if he never makes another one?

599
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:21,191
Speaker 0: then it's kind of yeah See, it's a risk, but that's the guy like Firefly.

600
00:40:21,533 --> 00:40:32,196
Speaker 0: there's talk that after the moratorium whatever ends They might just start making Firefly direct to DVD and all the fans will buy it and that'll cover everything Whatever.

601
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,307
Speaker 0: they could do the same thing with this.

602
00:40:34,952 --> 00:40:35,841
Speaker 0: But the thing is we don't know.

603
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:36,668
Speaker 0: we'll just have to wait and see.

604
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:37,835
Speaker 1: Costs a lot of money.

605
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:41,070
Speaker 1: more money to make a live-action Ava than it costs to make a Firefly.

606
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:43,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, depends on how well the live-action Ava does.

607
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:46,608
Speaker 0: I mean if it does well great if it does really well.

608
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:49,479
Speaker 1: Hmm I have a feeling it's just.

609
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,470
Speaker 1: he's already figured out how much money he needs to make it.

610
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,990
Speaker 1: I think he under he understands how much he's probably gonna make off of it and he'll probably profitable.

611
00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:58,675
Speaker 1: You know knows how much.

612
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:02,748
Speaker 0: but well the initial D movie the live-action everyone who's seen it loves it.

613
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:04,997
Speaker 0: Yeah We haven't seen it yet.

614
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,586
Speaker 0: So that's my only reason we haven't talked about it.

615
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:12,862
Speaker 1: Yep Apparently they also mentioned the live-action transform live-action slash CG transformers movie.

616
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,045
Speaker 1: that's gonna come out.

617
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:20,330
Speaker 0: Wait, you said slash CG because Like there's no CG and the Ava movie, right?

618
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:25,570
Speaker 1: You know, but it's mostly CG because the CG guys are the main characters as opposed to just the robots.

619
00:41:26,172 --> 00:41:33,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, but because he can't make Optimus Prime be some guy in a cardboard suit You could that'd be awesome it would be.

620
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:38,948
Speaker 1: but anyway Apparently for that which I did not know Steven Spielberg is the executive producer.

621
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:39,210
Speaker 1: What?

622
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,136
Speaker 1: Yeah of the Transformers no action movie.

623
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:42,939
Speaker 1: That's not made yet.

624
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:44,102
Speaker 0: That's great.

625
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:45,205
Speaker 0: Cuz it's not George Lucas.

626
00:41:45,847 --> 00:41:46,449
Speaker 0: I would cry.

627
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:53,103
Speaker 1: Apparently they're also tapping the Transformers fan base of it.

628
00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:54,770
Speaker 0: It's a pretty big fan base.

629
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:57,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean how many of us remember that movie?

630
00:41:58,002 --> 00:41:59,286
Speaker 0: I I'd cry.

631
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:05,256
Speaker 0: I didn't really cry But I cried a little when spoiler Optimus Prime died.

632
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,520
Speaker 1: It's not all the other transformers.

633
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,443
Speaker 1: Well a bunch of them.

634
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:09,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rodimus Prime just couldn't cut it either.

635
00:42:09,976 --> 00:42:10,630
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

636
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:16,366
Speaker 1: It's like ultra Magnus was so cool and powerful except his personality was so weak.

637
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:17,590
Speaker 1: He couldn't meet a leader anything.

638
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:27,970
Speaker 1: I should have made his Personality difference that he would be like the secondary leader His rod and this was just more like, you know, I guess they could have done worse.

639
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bumblebee could have taken over.

640
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:33,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I made Rodimus his personality different and make ultra Magnus just some guy.

641
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:36,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Rodimus work because he was kind of the reluctant.

642
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:44,573
Speaker 0: I've now until they got rid of them because he's like I have this thrust into my hands and I don't feel capable or Confident.

643
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,641
Speaker 0: and oh, I'm not.

644
