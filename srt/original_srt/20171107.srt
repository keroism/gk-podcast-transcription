1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,032
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, November 7th, 2017.

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,553
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,659
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,178
Speaker 0: tonight We're talking about the 2010 board game Luna in the domain of the moon.

5
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:23,093
Speaker 1: priestess Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:30,319
Speaker 0: So it's definitely too late for any of you who are listening to this.

7
00:00:30,842 --> 00:00:37,385
Speaker 0: So rather than telling you that you should go vote if you didn't vote Mmm Eat on it.

8
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:40,600
Speaker 1: A lot of people listening to this don't even live in the United States.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,475
Speaker 1: Maybe whatever country they live in their voting day is today Or maybe someone's listening to this way after the day we recorded it in.

10
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:47,520
Speaker 1: their voting day is today.

11
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:48,739
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's possible.

12
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:55,160
Speaker 0: But if it is if it is 2017 and it's only in the United States for you vote in the second Tuesday in November And you're an American citizen.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:08,117
Speaker 0: So we have elections every four years that like half of us vote in and we have elections every two years That are just as important that like a quarter of us voted and then we have elections every year that like

14
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:09,140
Speaker 1: in the no-one

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,844
Speaker 0: Vote say yeah

16
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:11,153
Speaker 1: those in-between years.

17
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,220
Speaker 1: It's like in New York.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:23,322
Speaker 1: It's basically like one year which is this year you vote for like mayor and shit And then the next year you vote for governor and shit and then the year after that you vote for like state Represent.

19
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:24,126
Speaker 1: it's all mixed up.

20
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:27,359
Speaker 1: You basically keep voting for different people in different parts of government every year.

21
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,292
Speaker 0: Many layers most Americans don't vote in.

22
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:32,140
Speaker 0: really any of those except the president won.

23
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:40,629
Speaker 0: Yep, so yeah, if you didn't vote you really should have voted and if you're in New York You probably should have voted against having a constitutional convention.

24
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,373
Speaker 0: No, probably.

25
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:45,100
Speaker 1: I mean that one wasn't really, you know, the biggest deal either way.

26
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:49,210
Speaker 0: Nah But I guess my mother the only point I want to make is I don't want.

27
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,929
Speaker 0: this isn't a politics episode and because there's no Way, you'll listen to this before the voting.

28
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:54,733
Speaker 0: We'll already know why.

29
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:56,440
Speaker 1: the time you hear this will already know what happened.

30
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:10,854
Speaker 0: yep, but what I will say is that You should vote even in the small elections where someone is running uncontested because even they're Casting an actual ballot and being a member of a party.

31
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:12,705
Speaker 0: when you cast that ballot It does.

32
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:14,217
Speaker 0: one thing that's very important in the?

33
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:23,150
Speaker 0: u.s Is a clear signal to that party that you will show up in the next year's election And they will use that data accordingly.

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:38,199
Speaker 0: if they know you're reliable and you're going to show up They're much more likely to listen to what your little district cares about a little bit in a way that they will not Certain causes in the u.s Tend to not get a lot of traction because the people who care about those causes are not the kind of people who vote

35
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:39,122
Speaker 1: Right.

36
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:49,092
Speaker 1: if there's some tiny election and someone's running uncontested and like, you know, you know in some tiny town 10,000 extra people come up and just vote yes for that uncontested person.

37
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:49,774
Speaker 1: They go.

38
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,398
Speaker 1: Oh, I got these 10,000 people.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,668
Speaker 1: Yes for me no matter what.

40
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:58,508
Speaker 1: so then when rich guy says hey politician Why don't you do some evil evil?

41
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,397
Speaker 1: They say I don't need your money.

42
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:04,556
Speaker 1: evil, man I can do what I believe in because I got these 10,000 people who vote for me.

43
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:08,227
Speaker 1: when I'm on contested I'm not afraid of being not elected again.

44
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:13,642
Speaker 1: Get your ass out of here evil person unless they are an evil person in which case contest them.

45
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:27,826
Speaker 1: if they're just greedy and they're taking the money and listening to the rich person and not to you that they know You show up They know that you're paying attention and showing up to vote and then you know If you're all staying at home, they go.

46
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,170
Speaker 1: Ah, these people staying at home.

47
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,775
Speaker 1: They're ignoring my evil ways.

48
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,975
Speaker 1: I can continue my evil ways unpunished And that's what they do.

49
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:42,190
Speaker 0: But that aside we got a bunch of gaming news before we talk about this Luna game Which I didn't realize was as old as it is because I didn't really.

50
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,514
Speaker 1: how old is it?

51
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:43,555
Speaker 0: 2010.

52
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:50,898
Speaker 0: That's not that old seven years Anyway, anyway, so in the news, this is such a minor thing, but it's pretty funny.

53
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,213
Speaker 0: Scott Pointed this out to me.

54
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:54,240
Speaker 1: It's barely a news.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah But there's a casting call in New York for people who play netrunner to be on a Showtime show Where they need ten people playing netrunner.

56
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:17,079
Speaker 1: So our local netrunner community organizer person I guess was the point of contact for this and was like hey He spread the word about it And like I'm I can't figure out the whole deal.

57
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:21,940
Speaker 1: But basically there's gonna be some scene in this show called billions, which I've never watched.

58
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,105
Speaker 0: I've never even heard of.

59
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,539
Speaker 0: I have heard of it because how how have you heard of it?

60
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,080
Speaker 1: so the show billions is about it's it's a Obviously fictional is like Brewster's millions.

61
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,680
Speaker 1: But no, it is a fictional adaptation of real life events involving former US Attorney Preet Bharara.

62
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:51,519
Speaker 1: And I listen to former US Attorney Preet Bharara's podcast And he was like he mentioned on the show how his parents were so proud there's gonna be a TV show about their You know awesome lawyer son.

63
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:58,459
Speaker 1: And then they started watching the first beginning of the show and it's like some sexy garbage trash TV scene.

64
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:00,268
Speaker 0: Well, it is Showtime.

65
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,579
Speaker 1: and then he's like well done with that garbage.

66
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:09,180
Speaker 1: Which is why a major reason one of the many major reasons I don't watch live-action.

67
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,066
Speaker 0: Are they gonna kiss?

68
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:12,573
Speaker 0: are they gonna fight any?

69
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,100
Speaker 0: are they fighting over that girl in the middle?

70
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,983
Speaker 0: Is that what's going on?

71
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,980
Speaker 1: It's some garbage us live-action drama crap.

72
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,192
Speaker 1: You don't need to watch this show except for the netrunner scene.

73
00:05:20,213 --> 00:05:24,905
Speaker 1: That will be on YouTube for sure but it's like To do this thing.

74
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:30,202
Speaker 1: apparently the details are still sparse, but you get paid like $250 for a day of work Which ain't bad.

75
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:34,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially if you don't have a high paying job or you're like, that's pretty good.

76
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,360
Speaker 0: You're a punk kid?

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, go for it.

78
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,180
Speaker 1: That's pretty good money.

79
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,143
Speaker 1: There are people who know how to actually know how to play netrunner and the fact that they know how to play netrunner I guess is important.

80
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 1: shows that the game will somehow feature in the show and not just be a backdrop, but they're.

81
00:05:49,961 --> 00:06:00,520
Speaker 1: Apparently there's some scene and the setting of the scene is a netrunner Tournament or event and therefore they need to create this scene and which is why they need these extras to play netrunner there.

82
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,749
Speaker 1: And apparently it's not in New York City.

83
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:06,960
Speaker 1: They're getting people from New York to get on some mode of transportation.

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,660
Speaker 1: Wait what and take them to the Hamptons where the filming will occur way that that is definitely for a very long period of time.

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,160
Speaker 1: I think you get on it like three or something and they'll take you there and you'll come back like way late.

86
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,908
Speaker 0: That is definitely a murder cabin.

87
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:25,100
Speaker 1: No one's coming home from Thursday night through, you know, Friday morning.

88
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,780
Speaker 1: Who knows when you'll get back you getting paid money good money for it that amount of hours of work.

89
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:35,400
Speaker 1: Well, you know if I play netrunner So I know you can complain about if I didn't have anything better to do that would be an experience.

90
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:35,582
Speaker 0: I

91
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:45,682
Speaker 1: just I hope that they Obviously, it's too much hassle for me to do it Even though the money is even okay for someone who has money like me, but I'd have to take off work, which is a problem Yeah,

92
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:46,805
Speaker 0: but the

93
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:47,688
Speaker 1: I don't

94
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,820
Speaker 0: wanna go to my boss and be like, yeah, someone's paying me to play a card game in the Hamptons.

95
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I don't trust some garbage TV show to portray geeks who play netrunner and a positive correct light.

96
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:11,448
Speaker 1: You know, I expect it to be some horrible bullshit like Big Bang Theory, which is you know, basically You know as offensive to nerds as you know Racist things are to people of color.

97
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:14,920
Speaker 0: I would I would say that the latter is a bit more offensive.

98
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:15,664
Speaker 1: I mean, it's more.

99
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,113
Speaker 0: I see where you're going fence.

100
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:17,777
Speaker 1: It's saying it's in.

101
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:17,958
Speaker 1: it's.

102
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,246
Speaker 1: obviously Racism is a much worse.

103
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,632
Speaker 0: No, I see where you're going with that.

104
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:23,220
Speaker 0: I just would not make that comparison.

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,650
Speaker 1: No, listen, it's racism is a much worse problem.

106
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:31,835
Speaker 1: that harms people much much more than any sort of Discrimination against nerdy people.

107
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:33,540
Speaker 1: nerdy people are much much much.

108
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:34,563
Speaker 1: I can't have enough.

109
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:37,454
Speaker 1: much is less persecuted than people who are not.

110
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,100
Speaker 0: why you get those qualifications out there?

111
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,214
Speaker 1: Yes, but right it is the same type of thing where you're create.

112
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:51,060
Speaker 1: you were putting out some incorrect Stereotype right causing people to have bad views of a group.

113
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:55,519
Speaker 0: So in other news Blizzard overwatch and I'd still play a lot of overwatch.

114
00:07:56,761 --> 00:08:09,380
Speaker 0: There is a lot of toxic behavior there because all gaming has a lot of toxic behavior, yes Especially competitive gaming and Blizzard has been attempting to and they've been doing more than a lot of game come.

115
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:15,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much the League of Legends company riot and Blizzard are doing the most of anyone which is still not enough.

116
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:19,888
Speaker 0: I mean remember in our panel we did on quitting like Blizzard is pretty clear.

117
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:24,568
Speaker 0: Jeff Kaplan was like if you're gonna quit games Rather just ban you from overwatch completely.

118
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:27,016
Speaker 0: There's no point in you even having the game.

119
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:30,457
Speaker 1: Yep, so they're People still quit the game.

120
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:37,177
Speaker 0: So actually since the hardline penalties on quitting have been coming into the game.

121
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,140
Speaker 1: There's much less.

122
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:41,089
Speaker 0: I have not seen someone quit a competitive game.

123
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,530
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,594
Speaker 0: Not one.

125
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:46,107
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and That's kind of amazing actually to me.

126
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:46,991
Speaker 1: It's happening.

127
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:47,413
Speaker 1: You're just not.

128
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,257
Speaker 1: it's just in a games.

129
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:48,940
Speaker 1: You're not playing it.

130
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:56,016
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I'm saying it used to happen in a high percentage of the competitive games I was in and it has happened in none of the competitive games.

131
00:08:56,056 --> 00:08:56,900
Speaker 0: I've been in for a while.

132
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,906
Speaker 0: They are actually Escalating.

133
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:12,997
Speaker 0: you can read the details here but they're escalating their punishment because one thing that they appear to be doing that is very good is that they are looking at Data in terms of when they try a new thing like punishing people.

134
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:13,680
Speaker 0: in a certain way?

135
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:17,613
Speaker 0: Does it actually affect the bad behavior or not?

136
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:28,095
Speaker 0: in some quantitative fashion and A thing that a lot of games do if someone is being shitty in communications is cutting off their communications Mm-hmm.

137
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:41,980
Speaker 0: The problem they have discovered is that that actually seems to drive shitty people into more aggressive forms of harassing and griefing Because if they can't say their racist stuff on the voice chat, they're gonna throw the game instead.

138
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:45,590
Speaker 0: They're gonna harass people with the actions of their characters instead.

139
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:45,971
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

140
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:50,042
Speaker 0: So it seems like the thing they're doing Primarily.

141
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:55,667
Speaker 1: it's like you ever see someone in the street who's mad and then the cops try to arrest him and they get even more Mad like, you know, like.

142
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:57,958
Speaker 1: they're just yelling at someone but then the cops are we're gonna arrest.

143
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:58,440
Speaker 1: you know, what?

144
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:01,011
Speaker 1: Right, they explode even more.

145
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,860
Speaker 1: that's that same phenomenon Yeah.

146
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:10,972
Speaker 0: So they're actually straight up going to start banning people Even for the things that previously they would just punish them for.

147
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,597
Speaker 1: they don't want someone to do.

148
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:24,220
Speaker 1: my plan Which is you take everyone's credit card and if someone misbehaves you charge them a fortune of money And if they don't pay then debtors prison, I think a compromise solution would be you buy overwatch.

149
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,560
Speaker 1: It works in like the professional sporting leagues.

150
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:32,660
Speaker 1: If you don't you you become you know You join and if you break the rules you get a fight or something you punch someone in the face.

151
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,615
Speaker 1: We find you a few thousand dollars.

152
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,200
Speaker 0: How about this?

153
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,868
Speaker 1: One's gonna say a racial slur.

154
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:40,520
Speaker 1: if it cost them ten thousand dollars watch cause about 40 bucks.

155
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:52,791
Speaker 0: So right now in games like counter-strike when people get banned they buy another account which creates a sort of interesting Scenario where you're basically milking money out of racists by continually banning them And still they're not charging enough money.

156
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,180
Speaker 1: The fine should be a fortune.

157
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:55,243
Speaker 0: Well, no well So what they should do?

158
00:10:55,263 --> 00:11:06,517
Speaker 0: because they if if you buy the game for 40 bucks and you get banned for one One of those kinds of reasons if you try to buy the game again Unless they just don't let you ever buy it again, like you're just banned as soon as they figure out it's make

159
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:07,160
Speaker 1: another account.

160
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they've.

161
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:20,060
Speaker 0: a lot of these companies are getting better at Identifying when someone makes a new account because they had to use a credit card somewhere to buy it Yep, and just banning them again after they take their money, which I think is really funny.

162
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,589
Speaker 1: So I'm saying take a lot of their money.

163
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,220
Speaker 0: No, so put him on a list.

164
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:26,555
Speaker 0: Oh, you were banned for this reason to buy the game again.

165
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,081
Speaker 0: It's now $400.

166
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:28,744
Speaker 1: No, you should get.

167
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:32,959
Speaker 1: you should have to pay the $400 and then not be able to play the game again.

168
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:37,480
Speaker 1: That's how it you know, it's like oh you buy the game for 40 bucks because we need money, right?

169
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,688
Speaker 1: And if everyone behaves we need some money, right?

170
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,576
Speaker 1: Oh, you said a racial slur.

171
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:42,278
Speaker 1: That's it.

172
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,886
Speaker 1: We're taking $10,000.

173
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:47,821
Speaker 1: go to hell eat shit and die and you can never play the game again Sorry.

174
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:56,510
Speaker 0: So anyway, what overwatch is doing I'm talking about is that they're not doing things like Hell-banning toxic people into their own hellscape.

175
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,994
Speaker 0: Nope or any of that stuff.

176
00:11:58,255 --> 00:11:59,880
Speaker 0: They're just they're taking the very direct.

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,138
Speaker 0: well your band forever approach sounds good, so we'll see how this goes.

178
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:16,093
Speaker 0: and The problem with overwatch is that with the competitive scene that is appearing I'm laughing because people in the stream saw the headline of this tab.

179
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:17,599
Speaker 0: the tab just said sex.

180
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:19,848
Speaker 1: What a great headline.

181
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:20,651
Speaker 1: so they're like, what's the?

182
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,419
Speaker 1: that's a headline is gonna get you some clicks.

183
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,928
Speaker 0: good You're a tab from the left dare.

184
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:25,510
Speaker 0: I ask.

185
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:36,264
Speaker 0: so overwatch is for real competitive professional league has not even begun games yet and yet already a Sexual assault scandal.

186
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:39,855
Speaker 0: I may a staff member of one of the teams.

187
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:40,316
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

188
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:41,520
Speaker 1: it wasn't our New York team.

189
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:51,615
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a really shitty name as far as I remember appears to have sexually they're allegedly Sexually assaulted as twitch streamer and was fired over it.

190
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,598
Speaker 0: There's a whole article here.

191
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,160
Speaker 0: You can read.

192
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:55,340
Speaker 1: That's a someone you can definitely find there.

193
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,140
Speaker 1: It's an athlete in a sporting league.

194
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,634
Speaker 1: You can find them for sure and not slightly jokingly like I was just talking about.

195
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:11,649
Speaker 0: finding seriously find them Oh my god, and yet so the see also just the middle of this article is also jail Starcraft player Drunkenly harass women on stream gets banned.

196
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,880
Speaker 0: You can see why this is such a big problem.

197
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:22,780
Speaker 0: They can't they can't even avoid this kind of thing happening in a league that has not yet started.

198
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:25,528
Speaker 0: That is the extent of this problem.

199
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:25,949
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

200
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,520
Speaker 0: So in other news, this is Scott's news, right?

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,940
Speaker 1: So there's actually a bunch of news.

202
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,184
Speaker 1: I'm gonna combine all them.

203
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:36,679
Speaker 1: one's a little bit older and that is that there was a studio at EA.

204
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,887
Speaker 1: EA bought this game studio.

205
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,955
Speaker 1: It's a called visceral games or something, right?

206
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:41,698
Speaker 1: Is that what it's called?

207
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:44,939
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, and basically this is like a week or two ago.

208
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:46,726
Speaker 0: I think now this was really funny.

209
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:47,147
Speaker 0: Scott.

210
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:50,940
Speaker 0: Scott was like yo at EA shut down some game studio Star Wars game.

211
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:55,480
Speaker 0: So I googled for EA Star Wars layout and you found an old story.

212
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,367
Speaker 0: The top two articles are from right.

213
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:02,618
Speaker 0: now like October this year EA shuts down visceral games Star Wars game.

214
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:12,420
Speaker 0: moving to other thing the second link is After a thousand layoffs EA finds itself short-handed for Star Wars games from 2013.

215
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,326
Speaker 1: That was when they were starting with the Star Wars games.

216
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:14,968
Speaker 1: Yes, right.

217
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,577
Speaker 0: So basically environmental storytelling via Google.

218
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:24,364
Speaker 1: They had this Studio that also had some famous gaming people working for it Like what's her name Amy?

219
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,980
Speaker 1: something like they made Dead Space I think and some other says face the battlefield.

220
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:32,494
Speaker 0: I don't feel hardline which I never played kind of games that Scott doesn't care about.

221
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:33,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they were still really.

222
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:37,500
Speaker 0: They're currently working on Uncharted with Amy Hennig, right?

223
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:45,007
Speaker 1: The point is that they EA had the studio and they were making a Star Wars single-player kind of Experience game like Uncharted.

224
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:49,180
Speaker 0: it was only Star Wars and this studio is known for critically acclaimed triple-a game.

225
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't personally enjoy but there's still big-time games and they shut that shit down, right?

226
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:57,698
Speaker 1: so on top of that right, it's now only a little while later.

227
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:00,734
Speaker 1: and Runic games the people who make torchlight.

228
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,930
Speaker 1: they're done Rest in peace.

229
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:03,796
Speaker 0: Yep, GG.

230
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:14,877
Speaker 1: and also in the news telltale games the people who make all those little adventure games like the Walking Dead and the wolf among us and I think they got today as a Batman.

231
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:20,076
Speaker 0: I think yeah Which I don't know anything about their sales numbers, but they seem to be doing well.

232
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,200
Speaker 1: They got some Game of Thrones.

233
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,767
Speaker 1: They make adventure games.

234
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,540
Speaker 1: They seem to have like a huge fan club and we were at PAX.

235
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:30,040
Speaker 1: We got that telltale like mega pack of like every game that had been released up to that point.

236
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:39,840
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Because I don't that's not my thing really but I so I said to him I thought I'd play them like on my laptop while I was traveling.

237
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,291
Speaker 0: No, cuz that's the perfect thing to do.

238
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:45,813
Speaker 0: on like a 20-hour flight I ended up just playing Civ 6 and like every flight I had.

239
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:52,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's part of the point I'm about to make anyway, but They just laid off like 20 25 percent of their staff.

240
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:56,830
Speaker 1: It's a basically big-time layoffs.

241
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,720
Speaker 1: now all across video game history.

242
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,185
Speaker 0: They at least that we again.

243
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:06,645
Speaker 0: we can't get into the details of all these but they did say something interesting and the subtitle of this article Delivers it succinctly.

244
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,980
Speaker 0: They're gonna focus on delivering fewer better games, right?

245
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,568
Speaker 1: No, here's the real story right?

246
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:18,054
Speaker 1: the story that is not written in the in the text But in the subtext or perhaps the sub subtext, it's called subtext.

247
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:18,475
Speaker 1: Yeah.

248
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,060
Speaker 1: Okay, what's happening?

249
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:24,020
Speaker 1: Here is because you think these people are making video games holiday seasons coming up, right?

250
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,570
Speaker 1: Your game should be coming out real soon.

251
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,000
Speaker 1: Get you big money, right?

252
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,806
Speaker 1: No, what's actually going on here?

253
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:32,500
Speaker 1: is this the habits of people who play games these days?

254
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:33,222
Speaker 1: Right?

255
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:37,480
Speaker 1: are the for the people who play a lot of games like video game people, right?

256
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,671
Speaker 1: The kind of people who would play a Star Wars game.

257
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 1: These are all serious game companies.

258
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,776
Speaker 1: Right making games are nerds not phone games for everybody.

259
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:50,959
Speaker 1: Yep The Single-player games are not making the bank or at least they're not making enough bank.

260
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:55,040
Speaker 0: This is why so many games are moving toward loot crate bullshit.

261
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:59,422
Speaker 1: All of these companies are making single-player one-time Experiences.

262
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:03,293
Speaker 1: right the the adventure games from telltale or episodic, but there's still.

263
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:04,656
Speaker 1: buy it play it done with it.

264
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:07,411
Speaker 1: torchlight Even though it has some co-op and stuff is.

265
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,638
Speaker 1: buy it play it done with it.

266
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,910
Speaker 1: That Star Wars game is a single-player thing.

267
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,401
Speaker 1: that was gonna be buy it play it done with it Right.

268
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:19,060
Speaker 1: the way the behaviors of gamers these days self rim everyone I know include

269
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,825
Speaker 0: Specifically PC gamer

270
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:36,833
Speaker 1: right especially but even console people is that you have some game That's or game or games that are the ones that you go back to and they are almost definitely multiplayer games that have some sort of Microtransaction or something that keeps you putting money into it forever, right?

271
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:38,900
Speaker 1: You got your overwatch over there rim.

272
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got your sit you got your sieve over there.

273
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:52,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the game you can just keep going to with this multiplayer for you can keep playing it forever except I also play the single-player, but the single-player is an experience that is Effectively infinite unless you're crazy, right?

274
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,224
Speaker 1: But the single-player games?

275
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,973
Speaker 1: you go to them like a Mario Odyssey or a Zelda.

276
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:04,809
Speaker 1: you play them and then you done with them Yeah, and then you put them on the shelf and then you unless you're a speedrunner or something You go back to where you came from.

277
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:10,319
Speaker 0: maybe a year a few years down the road You're like, I'll play through some Zelda again, but that's not me.

278
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:16,640
Speaker 0: But even that that would be even worse if when I when the clock rings to play a single-player game.

279
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:21,100
Speaker 1: Getting more than 50 bucks at you or 60 or whatever is for that Mario.

280
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,164
Speaker 1: That's the end of it right?

281
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:26,380
Speaker 1: how much money would the overwatch get at you if you were a loot crate buying person?

282
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:38,575
Speaker 0: yep, and the thing is and I actually read a couple articles about this like this this topic is being discussed all over gaming circles, but It doesn't seem to be being discussed that much in like the games press.

283
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:40,160
Speaker 0: It's not the big games press, right?

284
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:52,585
Speaker 1: So what's gonna happen here is you're gonna see that Star Wars game is gonna come back and when it comes back It's gonna look a lot more like destiny and a lot less like Uncharted right Those telltale games.

285
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:54,973
Speaker 1: I don't know what's gonna happen with them in the long run.

286
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,759
Speaker 1: We'll see how if they can hold up.

287
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:01,960
Speaker 1: I feel like the novelty of them has worn off a lot and only the core fans are really sticking with those.

288
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,916
Speaker 1: If I was them I would go mobile and sell them for a lot cheaper and make them a lot shorter.

289
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:09,104
Speaker 0: and those kinds of Games like like.

290
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:10,970
Speaker 1: there's what there's one on mobile.

291
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,234
Speaker 1: It's like I even play it.

292
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:13,900
Speaker 1: It's like the stupidest game where it's like.

293
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,808
Speaker 1: It's almost like an escape room, but not quite.

294
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:22,161
Speaker 1: It's basically a lot of puzzles where you just manipulate stuff until you right It's just.

295
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:31,388
Speaker 1: it's just like they'll be a weird object and you manipulate it a whole bunch and find all its secret Compartments and everything and then it lets you go to the next one Or Monument Valley.

296
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,400
Speaker 1: Monument Valley they came up with a sequel.

297
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:40,570
Speaker 1: Geniuses did exactly the things that Scott always says to do don't announce a release date Don't even tell you when you're working on it.

298
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:41,536
Speaker 1: Really, right?

299
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:42,160
Speaker 1: They just boom.

300
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,240
Speaker 1: They said Monument Valley to out today out of nowhere.

301
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,269
Speaker 1: Put it on the store making a ton of money.

302
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,611
Speaker 1: everyone where the phone buys it plays it and is done with it But it caused nothing to make a fucking Monument Valley, right?

303
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:54,980
Speaker 1: Unlike where it cost probably millions to make that Star Wars.

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,840
Speaker 1: Well, this is where it doesn't matter that everyone just paid five bucks and went on their merry way.

305
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:06,274
Speaker 0: The area that is in the most danger is the triple-a Single-player expensive game that can't bring in money forever.

306
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,080
Speaker 1: They can only bring in money in one shot.

307
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,780
Speaker 0: So a small single-player game from an indie studio has much more chance of breaking even than a triple-a single-player experience.

308
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:23,138
Speaker 1: yeah, and I think this is only going to continue because look at look at torchlight right and now look at el diablo.

309
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:29,612
Speaker 1: el diablo is Somehow even though it's still a single-player game that you can just play over and over They just keep blizzard.

310
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,144
Speaker 1: Just just keeps As much money.

311
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,312
Speaker 0: you can look at how many people every strike.

312
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:38,200
Speaker 1: every single blizzard game is a lifestyle game.

313
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,749
Speaker 1: They squeeze as much as they can to keep getting money out of.

314
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:43,540
Speaker 1: even Starcraft 2 just went free to play.

315
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:44,162
Speaker 1: So they can.

316
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:49,100
Speaker 1: it has loot boxes in it now so they can keep squeezing money out of every stone they got.

317
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:54,520
Speaker 0: Yep, you're also seeing more and more mobile games that there's almost no actual game there.

318
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,740
Speaker 0: They're not quite just a clicker, but they're more like that fire in the game.

319
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,318
Speaker 0: But there's actually not much going on.

320
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:10,714
Speaker 0: Yeah but they're tied to an IP that people are fans of but that IP where it traditionally made its money from a Single-player game by the expensive fire emblem game sales on those games.

321
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:12,580
Speaker 0: I don't think are going up either.

322
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:18,069
Speaker 0: There's way more money to made with Psychologically addicting loot crate bullshit.

323
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:18,330
Speaker 1: Yeah.

324
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:30,173
Speaker 1: Anyway, so that's that's what's going down And it means that if you are working in the video game industry on like fancy triple-a 3d single-player games You might want to go find someplace to work.

325
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,178
Speaker 1: that is making the.

326
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,787
Speaker 1: you know The multiplayer kind that is lifestyle.

327
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:44,740
Speaker 0: or be sure the game you're working on if it's a triple-a Single-player experience is the one that people are gonna play every couple months like a Mario or a Zelda or much Nintendo only.

328
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,424
Speaker 1: Of course, I'm burning through Really fast.

329
00:21:48,444 --> 00:21:57,220
Speaker 0: Resident Evil actually sells a bunch like with almost no effort and very little time I've gotten like a hundred and fifty moons and just kind of blown through a huge chunk of the game.

330
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,254
Speaker 1: I played it a whole bunch in like two shots and got a zillion moon dude last night.

331
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:01,616
Speaker 1: I got.

332
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:04,869
Speaker 1: I basically beat the donkey Town Donkey Kong town.

333
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:10,860
Speaker 1: I beat the fuck out of New Donk City Yeah, and then I'm gonna go back to it probably pretty soon, especially during this little Thanksgiving.

334
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:19,773
Speaker 0: but the trouble that was funny is I was basically a New Donk City and In the time between the second about a New Donk City ending part.

335
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:20,656
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

336
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:21,700
Speaker 0: That was so great.

337
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:26,060
Speaker 0: Oh good That was when that song starts playing and I go into that pipe and everyone's chit.

338
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was good stuff.

339
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:27,099
Speaker 0: That's good.

340
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:33,531
Speaker 0: But at the same time in the time between the second period Coming soon to get nice near you.

341
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:38,830
Speaker 0: the second period ended of the Rangers game And I was playing Mario until the third period started.

342
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,735
Speaker 0: So like 20 minutes or less.

343
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:45,524
Speaker 0: I got like 20 moons Like you can.

344
00:22:45,544 --> 00:22:46,709
Speaker 0: just I got to use paper.

345
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,260
Speaker 0: He looks like moon moon moon moon moon moon like Korok seeds.

346
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:53,748
Speaker 0: But yeah I basically only play The best single-player game.

347
00:22:53,768 --> 00:23:12,185
Speaker 0: that's in my queue at the time and once I beat it Then I go back to overwatch and counter-strike for like months until suddenly my brain is like you should play a single-player game and I go back to my queue and I literally pick what is The best game I have access to in the entire world right now And that's the one I'll play.

348
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:22,133
Speaker 1: since I'm all old and I can't do fast accurate movements of my hands anymore I've been sticking to card games as my go back Scott I found I found by continuing to play twitchy games.

349
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,320
Speaker 0: I'm actually maintaining my skills to a good degree.

350
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,379
Speaker 1: I lost the skills and I don't know how to get him back.

351
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,244
Speaker 0: Gotta just play.

352
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:29,235
Speaker 1: I didn't maintain them when I had the chance.

353
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:29,597
Speaker 1: Scott.

354
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:30,120
Speaker 1: now they gone.

355
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,518
Speaker 0: You got to just play counter-strike again And you know what?

356
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,267
Speaker 1: How am I gonna get the skills back at counter-strike.

357
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:39,035
Speaker 0: if I just get shot in the head immediately every time cuz the skill ranking will push you down there with the wood tiers.

358
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:44,860
Speaker 0: and So in my experience in overwatch, at least what if I'm less than woods here?

359
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:55,720
Speaker 0: Scott in overwatch the wood tiers I am literally neo the god walking around killing and not killing at my whim alone.

360
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:59,714
Speaker 0: They are I am invincible and I they die.

361
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:00,497
Speaker 1: in my rocket league.

362
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:01,160
Speaker 1: skill went down.

363
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,209
Speaker 1: I was but I was better at that than people.

364
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,560
Speaker 1: I knew just not better than people actually knew how to play.

365
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:08,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even that I tried to play it again and I was like hurt.

366
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:21,110
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

367
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,404
Speaker 0: So what was my thing?

368
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:31,450
Speaker 0: All right Remember, I don't know the context of this video in that I do not know how it was made.

369
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:35,790
Speaker 0: I assume this is not a human but someone wrote a simple program to do this.

370
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:40,750
Speaker 0: I would guess if I had to guess that this is not a neural network or anything.

371
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:45,305
Speaker 0: But either a human did this themselves, which means godspeed to you.

372
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:45,707
Speaker 0: Good, sir.

373
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:53,086
Speaker 0: That is amazing or They wrote a simple script because I'm pretty sure the bombs are 100% deterministic in this game.

374
00:24:53,426 --> 00:25:08,510
Speaker 0: Once you get to the end state and this is just be a three hour 18 minute and 15 second long video of a camera pointed at a CRT that has kaboom on the 2600 running until the score hits.

375
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:15,270
Speaker 0: It is hypnotic to watch and I have nothing else to say about it.

376
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:20,710
Speaker 1: Is the only person alive who still loves kaboom except for that one other person I was about to say who also loves kaboom.

377
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,950
Speaker 1: If you want to know why I made this video if you want to know people love kaboom rim that guy and the person who?

378
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,863
Speaker 1: Made this video if you are sure the person who made this video, isn't that guy?

379
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:35,550
Speaker 0: Pax makes me diamond hard and the reason that is is because the first packs ever went to.

380
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,475
Speaker 0: Among many things that happened to us.

381
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:46,206
Speaker 0: that packs was that moment where they had an Atari 2600 and I've thought boom was in it And it was running and I out loud news.

382
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:55,780
Speaker 0: Wow I wonder if anyone else in the world is good at this game and there was a dude standing there who is Good at that game and is just as obsessed with it as I am.

383
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:59,210
Speaker 0: the odds of that are zero and yet it happened.

384
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,817
Speaker 1: I mean are in fact one.

385
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,183
Speaker 1: Well, yeah one point.

386
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:03,790
Speaker 0: Oh the odd happened.

387
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,636
Speaker 0: I thought the odds were zero.

388
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,647
Speaker 0: what I underestimated was the power of fucking packs.

389
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,394
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm So what do you got?

390
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,526
Speaker 1: so I got actually high quality thing of the day.

391
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:16,347
Speaker 1: that shows You know yet again that I'm the best picker of things of the day.

392
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,377
Speaker 0: Good God This is an amazing thing of the day.

393
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,930
Speaker 0: I can't I can't even argue can't even argue with this shit.

394
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:23,179
Speaker 0: So how'd you find this?

395
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:25,107
Speaker 1: cuz I'm good at finding shit on the internet.

396
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:32,530
Speaker 1: So Something you don't think about often is grave diggin real-life grave diggin cuz it's pretty morbid.

397
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:45,550
Speaker 1: You don't think about it except that one time you go to the cemetery and there's people dig in a grave and it's like these laborers that don't talk and stay out of the way and Maybe you think for a second what their lives are like and then you don't think about them anymore.

398
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:51,953
Speaker 1: It's like how many people know someone who's like a grave digger just like as a friend or like, you know Someone with that profession.

399
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:53,076
Speaker 1: I sure don't.

400
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:58,650
Speaker 0: I usually think about grave diggers in the constant in the context of Willie from the Simpsons digging graves.

401
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:02,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even his job was school janitor and not grave digger.

402
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:08,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway Grave digger is that sort of like outcast from society kind of profession, right?

403
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:15,450
Speaker 1: It's not something people think about or whatever and if you do think about it It's like you know, you wouldn't want to associate with someone who's a grave digger.

404
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:17,637
Speaker 0: Well, they get again though.

405
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,761
Speaker 0: Remember this is the like.

406
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:25,854
Speaker 0: there's like I would but I'm saying in general Feeling when we used to listen to Penn's podcast Did they do?

407
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:29,570
Speaker 0: you talk a lot about like when someone is circus or not?

408
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:35,290
Speaker 0: Like if you're if you're a circus person, then you know all this circus crap that normal people just have no idea.

409
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:38,400
Speaker 0: I feel like people in the death industry.

410
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,724
Speaker 0: This is just part of that.

411
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:40,948
Speaker 0: Are you death you into death?

412
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:41,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know death.

413
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:43,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's obviously so anyway in Slovakia.

414
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:50,408
Speaker 1: There are some people who are grave diggers And in the death industry, you know funeral homes casket selling etc.

415
00:27:50,508 --> 00:28:11,045
Speaker 1: undertaking and You know, they were like, hey, let's try to like put on a different face on our work so that we're not so you know looked at with the creepy eye and People can see that we're actually real people and not just that You know sort of labor that you don't want to talk to when you're at a funeral.

416
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,270
Speaker 0: Chris points out in the stream.

417
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,344
Speaker 0: That is I think that's an outcast life path in burning wheel.

418
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:16,328
Speaker 1: Is it probably?

419
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:21,730
Speaker 1: Yeah So what they did here in Slovakia is they set up a an annual?

420
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,470
Speaker 1: Grave digging championship and made grave digging into a sport.

421
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,966
Speaker 1: It's can you dig the grave who can dig it fastest and also good enough and then refill.

422
00:28:29,986 --> 00:28:31,030
Speaker 0: That's a real good grave.

423
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:39,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they you dig the grave as fast as you can with your team of people Right using only the normal tools shovels and strong arms, right?

424
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:42,290
Speaker 1: They check your grave to make sure it's it's legit.

425
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:55,649
Speaker 1: It's deep enough long enough wide enough Properly shaped, you know structurally sound and then you fill that shit back in as fast as you can and they give out trophies and stuff to put a good a good face on this thing and also make a pretty good sport.

426
00:28:55,669 --> 00:29:02,790
Speaker 1: that happens to have ties to Death which are unsettling but you know, maybe you can get over it if you watch this video.

427
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:03,834
Speaker 0: This is pretty good.

428
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:08,049
Speaker 1: And next time you go to a cemetery look at the gravediggers of the different eye.

429
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,830
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, the book club book was the fifth season and we read it.

430
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,874
Speaker 0: I'm gonna pick the new book soon.

431
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:16,670
Speaker 0: I am almost done with the last book of the trilogy from the fifth season.

432
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:18,309
Speaker 1: I haven't even started reading the second book.

433
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:24,049
Speaker 0: Uh, I see why some people are disappointed with the second and third book, but I want to be very clear.

434
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:25,449
Speaker 1: But you're not among them.

435
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,152
Speaker 0: I am NOT.

436
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:31,690
Speaker 0: so far everything that the that the second or third book has revealed is the kind of thing that I wish.

437
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:33,715
Speaker 1: You know a lot more about sockets than I do.

438
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:34,517
Speaker 0: I know.

439
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:39,190
Speaker 0: so here's the thing in say the like later Prince of Nothing books.

440
00:29:39,432 --> 00:29:42,411
Speaker 0: They'll be like by the way, here's a whole bunch of shit Like.

441
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:45,161
Speaker 0: here's the answer to a big thing in this book.

442
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,530
Speaker 0: when that happens when you get a big info dumb.

443
00:29:48,133 --> 00:30:00,097
Speaker 0: There's more questions - no no, it answers questions Authoritatively in a really interesting way yet somehow leaves intact other Interrelated mysteries without raising new questions.

444
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,260
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

445
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:09,120
Speaker 0: So but everything I've learned so far has just made me Happier and more invested in the trilogy.

446
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:09,641
Speaker 1: Hmm.

447
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:12,430
Speaker 1: Like it's all you want to do some fifth season RPG.

448
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:16,613
Speaker 0: it's all ghost in the shell like There's.

449
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:19,264
Speaker 0: there's cool cyber punky nonsense going on.

450
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:20,610
Speaker 1: They can't leave anything out.

451
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,815
Speaker 1: It's got to be everything right.

452
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:38,181
Speaker 0: we get had the fantasy and the sci-fi you get some flashbacks to like pre-season societies And I know exactly what orogeny is and it's great nice But I don't know though I still don't know anything about warrant and what that place is.

453
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,993
Speaker 1: is the ghost in the shell stuff related to the Guardians I imagine.

454
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:45,070
Speaker 1: uh, not just the guy but but they had their cyber implants, right?

455
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:48,060
Speaker 0: Book two goes into that in detail.

456
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,850
Speaker 0: good Shafa is I think my favorite character.

457
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, he's way good, but he's not a sexy pirate captain.

458
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:53,580
Speaker 1: No.

459
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,550
Speaker 0: Well, no, I said favorite character not best character Not my husband.

460
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:02,357
Speaker 0: We were at game.

461
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:04,366
Speaker 1: I want to do sexy pirate captain fan art.

462
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,390
Speaker 1: send them to geek nights.

463
00:31:07,354 --> 00:31:11,675
Speaker 1: We have a forum by the way Community dot front row crew.

464
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:16,390
Speaker 1: calm you could come there find the thread for the book club and upload your sexy pirate captain fan.

465
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:23,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you happen to know anyone who looks like that character and acts like that character just send photos of your sexy pirate captain.

466
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,543
Speaker 0: So our next convention is going to be PAX unplugged.

467
00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:33,210
Speaker 1: it's like a week or two away.

468
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,979
Speaker 1: It's super soon.

469
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,290
Speaker 1: How soon is it said November?

470
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:46,865
Speaker 1: 17th 18th 19th in Philadelphia 10 Goddamn days for it by the time you're listening to this less than 10 days.

471
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:54,970
Speaker 0: This is the inaugural Tabletop only packs, but it is a full packs just aimed solely at tabletop.

472
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:56,319
Speaker 1: It's gonna have a megathon.

473
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:57,890
Speaker 1: it's gonna have a keynote.

474
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:00,086
Speaker 0: It's got a main theater just like normal packs.

475
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:07,596
Speaker 1: from that I think the guy who's in charge of watsy right how I mean if you're a tabletop gaming person How can you not hear what that person has to say?

476
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:13,630
Speaker 0: so Saturday at that in tabletop tourney 3 30 to 5 30 p.m We're doing an epic Carcassonne event.

477
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:19,429
Speaker 0: We're gonna teach a bunch of bunch of monsters how to be monstrous at Carcassonne and then make them fight with each other.

478
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,809
Speaker 1: It's like giving everyone a perfect strategy guide to a multiplayer game and then they all fight.

479
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:29,830
Speaker 0: It's gonna be good stuff and see who is the best and otherwise we're just gonna be there playing games and enforcement.

480
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:30,609

Speaker 0: I'm gonna finish that entire thing by the end of this month.

486
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:48,659
Speaker 0: And if you want a really really Weirdly homoerotic audiobook about Castlevania.

487
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,570
Speaker 0: That's then gonna be the final output of what I'm doing in there.

488
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,834
Speaker 1: We also got twitch.

489
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:54,097
Speaker 1: we got to Instagram.

490
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:55,180
Speaker 1: So you got the Twitter's.

491
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,304
Speaker 1: we got the Facebook's.

492
00:32:56,364 --> 00:33:01,459
Speaker 1: we got the Google+ we got pretty much Every kind of internet that there is.

493
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,026
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is even posted on LinkedIn.

494
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,410
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is there.

495
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:06,777
Speaker 1: You can find it.

496
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:07,983
Speaker 1: go and do so.

497
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:15,298
Speaker 0: and at ReviewCon Which is what we're calling a thing where we get together with our hardcore friends and play hardcore games We played a lot of board games.

498
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:17,950
Speaker 0: We're trying to review all of them before we forget about them.

499
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:21,624
Speaker 0: Yes, and one of the games we played was entirely new to me.

500
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:23,230
Speaker 1: I'd never seen it before in my life.

501
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,938
Speaker 0: I had never seen it, but I never played it.

502
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,224
Speaker 1: The box was appealing.

503
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:30,958
Speaker 0: It is just called Luna But apparently as an alternate name.

504
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:36,177
Speaker 0: the full name is Luna in the domain of the moon princess Which I guess is definitely accurate.

505
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:39,670
Speaker 0: It's been published by a bunch of different companies, but it was the man at one point.

506
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,505
Speaker 1: This is not a apparently very successful game.

507
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,890
Speaker 1: It's never became a big hit.

508
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:45,613
Speaker 1: I don't think.

509
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:57,980
Speaker 0: if you ask most board game people about it only the super nerdiest would know and My shortest possible assessment of it is that I have not encountered a game that is specifically like it combines.

510
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,879
Speaker 1: It's definitely a unique game.

511
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,836
Speaker 1: It can buy it is not so Amazing and to make it.

512
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:09,409
Speaker 1: it's like a great game that you want to play a whole bunch, but it's also not a bad game.

513
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,830
Speaker 1: It's not like oh this poopy game.

514
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:16,110
Speaker 1: It's just like it's not super great amazing game like say power grid or some Puerto Rico or something.

515
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:21,685
Speaker 1: Yep It's a game that I want very unique and therefore worth can't worth pay playing.

516
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,630
Speaker 1: if you're someone who cares about board games Now you that's your TLDR you can stop listening and then now we'll talk about the actual game.

517
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:43,402
Speaker 0: but I would play it again because and I would play it again an interesting thing about it is that having played at once the interrelations between the purely deterministic actions of the players is More complex than one might expect.

518
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:46,521
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah meaning Playing it again.

519
00:34:46,542 --> 00:35:01,610
Speaker 0: I may take Drastically different actions from the first time I played and despite that despite that complexity the first time we played it The scores were pretty close and people develop wildly different directional heuristics that seem to converge.

520
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:06,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, so first of all, this game is fascinating and that it is a perfect information game.

521
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is there's no cards in your hand.

522
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:10,642
Speaker 1: There's no secret.

523
00:35:10,662 --> 00:35:12,347
Speaker 1: There's no deck of things flipping up.

524
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,430
Speaker 1: There's no nothing.

525
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:20,990
Speaker 0: It's literally just like all right, everyone move your dudes Yep, move them around on these islands in a right a crook.

526
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:24,100
Speaker 1: So worker placement game in the middle of the map.

527
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:31,044
Speaker 1: in the middle of the game is this big hex map thing Which contains the moon princesses castle.

528
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:38,150
Speaker 1: the moon princess never goes there Yeah, but you can go there to pray to the moon princess and get a lot of victory points.

529
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:54,115
Speaker 0: Apparently and all around the moon princesses castle are these islands, you know It's funny because that middle part reminds me of the castle from Kalis in that it's the most prominent thing on the board and it seemed to be the true endgame Once people are reasonably skilled.

530
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:58,810
Speaker 1: Yes, all around the castle are these islands and each island has a different purpose, right?

531
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,279
Speaker 1: it's like an observatory and I forget what all the different islands are.

532
00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:08,259
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of them and so they all do something different Physically separate islands with a token.

533
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,630
Speaker 1: that's actually separate little cardboard islands that are you know.

534
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:20,642
Speaker 0: And on each island there is a token that is specific to that island that you can basically spend an action to take and Then you'll be able to use that later to do something.

535
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:31,830
Speaker 0: independently of that There is a moon priestess who moves from island to island in a deterministic fashion Having more dudes on an island when she's there is worth victory points.

536
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:38,408
Speaker 0: And there's also this jerk who's going around the other direction and you don't want to be on the island when he's there.

537
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:44,190
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And you basically on your turn you allocate what he's on the island with the moon princess.

538
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:50,228
Speaker 0: Well, that was an interesting situation that caused everyone to scatter to the winds priestess princess.

539
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:50,610
Speaker 1: I don't know.

540
00:36:51,391 --> 00:37:05,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, the theme like the tying the theme to the game is pretty thin Similarly to how the theme of village seems like it fits the game mechanics But doesn't really when you dig into it, so I basically ignored the theme.

541
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:15,870
Speaker 1: So the first thing about this game that you'll I noticed right away as soon as the rules were explained that I didn't even need To play one turn of the game to realize this is that you get some meeples and moving them is a pain in the ass.

542
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:20,983
Speaker 1: Yeah huge as soon as they explain the rules I'm like goddamn it's gonna be hard to move these guys around.

543
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:26,089
Speaker 1: the whole game is gonna be really About moving these guys and getting them moved to where I need them to be.

544
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:33,670
Speaker 0: So think of it kind of like when two people are having a fistfight in that if they're high-level martial arts masters.

545
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:43,549
Speaker 0: The act of moving your body in a way to then punch someone is itself a telegraphing of What direction you're like what kind of thing you're about to do?

546
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:50,030
Speaker 0: You got to set up moves well in advance in a public space where everyone can see what you're setting up.

547
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:52,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like you want to you want to move your meeple?

548
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:58,130
Speaker 1: You can move it barely and it caused like a whole action and it sucks and then everyone sees what you did and goes Huh?

549
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,470
Speaker 1: The guys like spent and the meeple can't do anything anymore because you moved it, right?

550
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:04,830
Speaker 1: You can move them way better if you get a boat.

551
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,050
Speaker 1: But to get a boat you got to go to the island that has boats on it and take a boat tile.

552
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:11,430
Speaker 1: And now everyone sees that you took a boat tiles.

553
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:16,330
Speaker 1: You're basically really when you do that you're just delaying your action to get a better action later.

554
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:26,490
Speaker 0: No I did find that a useful heuristic was by having Amy tile in front of you kind of scared other people from committing to actions that tile could fuck up.

555
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:39,050
Speaker 0: Yes, and that became so posturing became a big part of the game Which is why even though they are So different that I would not compare them otherwise and I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression from this comparison.

556
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:54,166
Speaker 0: But this game shares that very strongly with Hansa toy tonica in that The game is you can make very incremental actions on the board at significant personal cost meaning there's a very limited number of actions you can take.

557
00:38:54,186 --> 00:39:04,135
Speaker 0: yeah and The mere act of positioning something gives other players a ton of information about what you're trying to do Things that they can do now.

558
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:08,410
Speaker 0: Yep, but then when someone else put something down it definitely informed.

559
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:15,590
Speaker 0: So like when I see Scott still got two guys He could put out and I want to get the majority on the priestess, but Scott could put the guys there.

560
00:39:16,611 --> 00:39:23,694
Speaker 1: You don't want to make a move if someone else still has the ability to disrupt that move you wait until your move is invincible Unthreatened and then make it.

561
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:32,168
Speaker 1: but if everyone waits that then otherwise if you commit your two movements to go see the moon priestess And then someone else commits three and now you committed your moves and you got nothing for it.

562
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:36,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time you gotta move somewhere like you got to do stuff.

563
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,858
Speaker 0: You can't gotta play your hand not do anything.

564
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:48,319
Speaker 1: They can't just posture forever, which you can pass and take a candle But then what happens is like sure the board can go or if no one else passes It'll come back to you and you can do something you can.

565
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,424
Speaker 1: you don't have to keep passing.

566
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:53,479
Speaker 0: you can unpack now This passing mechanic and I can't stress this enough.

567
00:39:53,961 --> 00:39:59,280
Speaker 0: It is very rare that when someone does something weird with a Generally agreed upon mechanic in games.

568
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,530
Speaker 0: Usually that's bad like in ground floor.

569
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:07,450
Speaker 0: Yep, I kind of like this candle mechanic, but I guarantee if you're not careful, you're gonna explain it wrong or do it wrong.

570
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:14,713
Speaker 0: I was not properly educated on this rule when we started and I which was your own fault because it was explained like five times But it was.

571
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:21,410
Speaker 1: it's a non-standard passing mechanic Which is why I said my eyes didn't pay glazed over when it was being explained.

572
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:24,681
Speaker 1: But basically this four or five candle tiles how many?

573
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:27,210
Speaker 0: some number one, two, three, four five.

574
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:29,400
Speaker 1: Okay, it might be the number of players I don't know.

575
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:37,378
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you are four four four if you pass you take a candle tile and the candle starts to burn out Right, and then you wait.

576
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:42,889
Speaker 1: if the game gets her back around to you and the candle still hasn't burnt out You can obviously pass again.

577
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:47,330
Speaker 0: You could also take an action but passing again takes another candle.

578
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,562
Speaker 0: So it's not like most games.

579
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:53,890
Speaker 1: if they have this kind of mechanic Usually when you pass you're out out out come for the rest of the round or something.

580
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,857
Speaker 1: Nope, not in this game.

581
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:56,892
Speaker 1: as long as this candle you can keep going now.

582
00:40:56,932 --> 00:41:03,157
Speaker 0: the other alternative way that goes is people can pass and If they're not permanently out they can unpack.

583
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:10,210
Speaker 0: and the other way games tend to do this is the round only ends if Everyone passes once in a row.

584
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,775
Speaker 1: Nope There just needs to be.

585
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:12,899
Speaker 1: the candle has to burn out.

586
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,390
Speaker 1: one person could take all the candle pieces and that would burn it out.

587
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:20,184
Speaker 0: So I pass, Scott takes an action, Chris takes an action, I pass again.

588
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:20,866
Speaker 0: now everyone goes.

589
00:41:20,886 --> 00:41:31,609
Speaker 1: Oh shit, right It's like you can basically take candle burn the candle out as your action to sort of threaten people and to realize oh shit I might not get another action now.

590
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,489
Speaker 1: Crap, the candle has burnt this much.

591
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,730
Speaker 1: We didn't learn that so much later in the game.

592
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:39,818
Speaker 1: But knowing now what I know.

593
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:43,030
Speaker 0: You keep saying we it was just you you were the only one confused.

594
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:44,837
Speaker 1: Better the next time I play this game.

595
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:45,982
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a lot of rounds.

596
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:46,825
Speaker 1: I'm just like candle.

597
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:53,430
Speaker 0: That's fine All right, go especially because if you take candle early, it just it sort of puts a timer on everyone else.

598
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:59,450
Speaker 1: Yeah It makes them take an action for me to respond to instead of me taking the first action to putting myself at this advantage.

599
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:05,170
Speaker 0: So there's this worker placement game which has a part of the reason why we're not getting into the specific mechanics of all these.

600
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:05,893
Speaker 1: I forget them.

601
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,600
Speaker 1: I played the game once and it was a while ago.

602
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:15,570
Speaker 0: They're kind of immaterial to the review And there's a lot of them and they don't make sense unless we literally teach you the whole game.

603
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically each island has a tile.

604
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:23,070
Speaker 1: the tiles can do things But you have to sort of move a guy to a place get a tile then use the tile.

605
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:26,957
Speaker 1: It's very slow and you're telegraphing Everything that you can or might do.

606
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:34,525
Speaker 1: the main thing is the middle of the board of the hexes are I would say we say The main thing but really it's more like the end game sort of.

607
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:35,810
Speaker 0: it's the goal.

608
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,194
Speaker 0: But really the goal is victory.

609
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:37,455
Speaker 0: point.

610
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:46,104
Speaker 1: get these treasures by claiming them and then you put them into the middle and they're worth points And you can also bump people out of the middle that are adjacent to you by attacking.

611
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,570
Speaker 0: that is not what the fiction is.

612
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,815
Speaker 0: I don't care what the fiction is.

613
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:52,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, the mechanic of this is pretty unique.

614
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:55,060
Speaker 1: You can also lock your guys in and prevent them from being bumped.

615
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,850
Speaker 0: so you've got a yeah, but that's one of those tile actions.

616
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:06,790
Speaker 0: yep, so basically you've got this hex area and There is a limited number of the treasure type things where the numbers just count up.

617
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,609
Speaker 0: There's higher and higher numbers and all deterministic and you can only.

618
00:43:11,111 --> 00:43:16,850
Speaker 0: But you can spend actions to claim one and spend actions to put them into the castle.

619
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:23,688
Speaker 0: If someone puts a higher numbered one next to one of yours with a lower number your guy gets fucked.

620
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:28,930
Speaker 0: basically Yep, he's kicked out and he goes to a special place where you can't even do normal movement.

621
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:31,150
Speaker 0: He has to use one of those boats to get out.

622
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,535
Speaker 1: Yeah You have to use a crappy move.

623
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:38,578
Speaker 1: you have to get an extra action and like use a bunch of resources to rescue that guy Now because he's stuck on the dock of the castle.

624
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,525
Speaker 0: It's real bad.

625
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:45,120
Speaker 0: Yeah if it happens to you But you can only take numbers so high.

626
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,609
Speaker 1: there was a notable turn where I saw rim was in a vulnerable position And I basically was just like waiting and hoping rim would do this many.

627
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did it All right.

628
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:58,729
Speaker 0: So remember the Provost in Calis that would sort of move along to sort of set boundaries for what you can do.

629
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:08,395
Speaker 0: Yep, so there's there's a mechanic like the Provost and then every turn this thing moves further down this track Activating more of the treasure.

630
00:44:08,435 --> 00:44:11,810
Speaker 0: Yes unlocking higher numbers of treasure bringing you closer to the endgame.

631
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:16,530
Speaker 0: The earlier you move in you can get points for moving in but now you've got guys that are vulnerable.

632
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:18,570
Speaker 0: They could be kicked out for the end of the game.

633
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:19,929
Speaker 1: I'm moving in late is hard.

634
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:26,990
Speaker 0: One of the worker things you can do is get a tile that will let you skip one level ahead of that Provost.

635
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:40,328
Speaker 0: yeah, and All that combined makes a pretty complex mechanic that you could build an entire game around Mm-hmm, and yet this is the sub game of getting victory points within the game of doing stuff with these islands.

636
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:43,056
Speaker 0: So Pretty much if I

637
00:44:43,096 --> 00:44:43,317
Speaker 1: hadn't

638
00:44:43,960 --> 00:45:09,570
Speaker 0: read these rules and played this game This game reeks of a game that would fail in the way that ground floor failed in that it has Multiple mechanics that are like known mechanics, but are crooked in a way that is not commonly known meaning They're easy to mess up coupled with having multiple significantly complex mechanics in the same game that are not Obviously indirectly interrelated and yet they work pretty well together.

639
00:45:09,731 --> 00:45:10,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's weird.

640
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:12,410
Speaker 1: There's a lot of games like this out there.

641
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,689
Speaker 1: I remember playing a lot of them back in like the RIT days.

642
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:23,077
Speaker 1: We're like these really sort of semi unique euros that have things and mechanics that are like really Different from every other kind of game.

643
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:26,310
Speaker 0: like village is actually a recent example of a game that felt that way.

644
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,601
Speaker 1: Yeah village with the people dying and going in.

645
00:45:28,641 --> 00:45:30,349
Speaker 1: there's no other game that does that right?

646
00:45:31,552 --> 00:45:36,479
Speaker 1: And that sort of makes me personally want to play them But it doesn't make me want to like.

647
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:41,599
Speaker 1: it makes me want to play them a few times right and then sort of like that novelty is.

648
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:51,250
Speaker 1: that is the thing the game has going for it because really the game to Play is mostly kind of frustrating with all these limited actions, but it's not like a super fun time.

649
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:54,510
Speaker 0: But like to call Mexico Java have that same thing.

650
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,150
Speaker 0: What was the joke?

651
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:04,610
Speaker 0: we always said the way they figure out how many actions you get in those games is to Keep reducing the number by one until a fistfight breaks out in the playtesters right and then add one and leave it there.

652
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:18,270
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like it's not a super fun to play and the theme isn't that exciting even though moon priest is pretty cool Right, but but it was intellectually stimulating and difficult and I enjoyed my experience such that I want to play it again.

653
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:24,748
Speaker 1: Yeah I want to play it a few times But I wouldn't want to buy it or play it a whole bunch or make it my favorite game or give it.

654
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:27,870
Speaker 1: it's not like A great game that deserves awards or anything like that.

655
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:37,990
Speaker 1: You know, it's just like it's totally unique weird still good thing that someone who is way into board games Should definitely check out for a you know different experience.

656
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:44,630
Speaker 1: But you know obviously doesn't have the mass, you know, I don't want to say it doesn't deserve mass market.

657
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:48,670
Speaker 1: You know, I guess sales, but it doesn't have mass market sales.

658
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,642
Speaker 1: So it has what it deserves, but it feels very.

659
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:57,262
Speaker 0: I felt good about the decisions I was making decisions I made mattered a lot most of the time.

660
00:46:57,363 --> 00:46:58,286
Speaker 1: You don't get a lot of them.

661
00:46:58,346 --> 00:47:16,289
Speaker 0: That's why yep But the one thing it lacks is that because it's got some fairly complex mechanics all sort of interoperating It doesn't have the sort of I don't know simplistic elegance of Hansa toy tonic, which has a very similar reactive and posturing component.

662
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:24,250
Speaker 0: So I want to play this two or three more times and it's possible that I would enjoy it beyond that.

663
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:38,183
Speaker 0: But I'm not sure because I don't know if the game will lock into either a degenerate strategy among significant analysis or a Sort of very steady state like there is only one clear way to win and everyone's just racing to do it.

664
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:40,209
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

665
00:47:41,572 --> 00:47:53,130
Speaker 0: but I liked it and I haven't played a game like it and I think you should at least if you see it at a con You should definitely take it out of the library and play it, but I would not buy it sight unseen.

666
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:57,052
Speaker 1: No, I definitely it's one of those games you receive in a convention library You can like.

667
00:47:57,072 --> 00:47:57,775
Speaker 1: what the hell is that?

668
00:47:57,856 --> 00:48:00,630
Speaker 1: And if you ever say that about a game play it at least one time.

669
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:03,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's that mermaid game in the PAX library.

670
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,050
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell that is, but I really want to play it one time.

671
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,913
Speaker 1: But I guess this game I think it actually might have gotten cold I don't know.

672
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:17,326
Speaker 0: This game has a lot of meat to it more meat than you might expect and Despite having the trappings of the kinds of things that make me very wary of a game.

673
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:20,116
Speaker 0: It actually Executed on those things.

674
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:23,930
Speaker 1: also, it's a perfect information games that don't neglect that fact.

675
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,179
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of perfect information games out there.

676
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:34,950
Speaker 1: and the ones if you want a game that has no randomness No secrets, no bluffing and really, you know a lot more like chess only obviously more euro style.

677
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:38,281
Speaker 1: This is one to look at because there aren't many in that category.

678
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:45,358
Speaker 0: the perfect information games that have these kinds of mechanics tend to Devolve very rapidly into.

679
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,985
Speaker 0: this is the only clear path to her.

680
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:56,030
Speaker 0: Usually they're abstract like oshi Yeah, but this one I'm really curious if after two or three more plays there is a very clear sequence to victory.

681
00:48:56,213 --> 00:49:07,342
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I don't know other games that I have played that I would have made the same sort of question about Definitely devolve very rapidly this one at the end of our first play.

682
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:15,830
Speaker 0: I didn't have a path yet And that is notable to me because usually I find that path and I don't ever want to play the game again.

683
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,710
Speaker 0: I actually do want to play this game again, and you know us on geek nights.

684
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:23,770
Speaker 0: Wanting to play a game again is one of the highest pieces of phrase we could ever give to a game.

685
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:28,085
Speaker 0: It's like play once play more than once play forever.

686
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:29,350
Speaker 0: Those are the three levels you got.

687
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:37,760
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
