1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,266
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, February 20th, 2014.

2
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:17,140
Speaker 0: I'm rim rim fucked up, and this is geek night tonight the dentist.

3
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:21,536
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:37,120
Speaker 1: so Seriously rim fucked up like my microphone wasn't plugged in and I said I'm Scott and then yeah Yeah, so by the power of editing We just had him say it again.

5
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:43,537
Speaker 0: And now I got this other Clip of him not saying I'm Scott because you fucked up thing is he doesn't listen to the show.

6
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,946
Speaker 0: I could remove all this And no one would know I could.

7
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:46,890
Speaker 0: just I could just complete.

8
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,946
Speaker 0: I could take the I'm Scott from a previous episode Just throw it in there.

9
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,857
Speaker 1: No one would know what a weird show that would be.

10
00:00:54,802 --> 00:01:01,923
Speaker 0: How would anyone know I'd remove this part to me you and your muska hounds anyway, I just Stalling it up the.

11
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:08,060
Speaker 1: I Thought we had done a show on dentists or teeth or something a long time ago But it's like something we would have done in one of those Thursdays.

12
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:15,489
Speaker 1: I almost like it was a hundred percent sure we had done this episode when we were in Beacon at some point But I googled and I guess there isn't one.

13
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,285
Speaker 0: so if there is one and we didn't find it Scott's fault I'm gonna really regret it.

14
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:29,380
Speaker 1: I was I imagined a slight possibility that perhaps it long ago There was perhaps a suggestion to do this show and I may have said that's dumb idea.

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,063
Speaker 1: Let's not do that.

16
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:33,680
Speaker 1: that happens and if there's audio evidence of that that is bad.

17
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,690
Speaker 0: I mean to turn about his fair play anytime.

18
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,758
Speaker 0: I suppose a we should do a show.

19
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,420
Speaker 0: We haven't done one.

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,053
Speaker 0: You'll be like yeah, if we did do one, this is rims fault.

21
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:44,397
Speaker 0: He's the one who searched.

22
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:49,272
Speaker 0: That's right Whatever, but it's not Dennis time yet last night.

23
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,459
Speaker 0: We went and saw no man's land.

24
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:55,519
Speaker 1: There was a lot of landmines there and barbed wires.

25
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,227
Speaker 0: Well landmines of the heart.

26
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, a no man's land of the heart of the mind.

27
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:13,640
Speaker 0: It was interesting because you know, we went to see waiting for Godot, you know, Patrick Stewart McKellen basically some of the best actors ever and it was great, but everyone reads waiting for Godot in high school.

28
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:14,865
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't really.

29
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,030
Speaker 0: I said you ever read it.

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,732
Speaker 1: I saw the movie.

31
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:17,415
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

32
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:18,580
Speaker 0: So you least you were familiar.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:28,048
Speaker 0: everyone sees waiting for Godot having already been familiar with it when they see it in the theater kind of like with Macbeth or Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

34
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,856
Speaker 0: any of those things educated people.

35
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:34,848
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, uh No, man's land.

36
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:41,396
Speaker 0: I very pointedly Did not read it did not do any research and do literally nothing about it.

37
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,459
Speaker 1: I knew it was about.

38
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,038
Speaker 1: I Thought I read that it was about like some World War one veterans, but maybe that's that is.

39
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:53,259
Speaker 0: that is Maybe true, but they were old enough to be World War one.

40
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:59,274
Speaker 1: better I guess that may be true But that has little to do with the plot or any plot.

41
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:05,072
Speaker 0: is that there's a no man's land Between all men where they never truly come together.

42
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:06,496
Speaker 0: and it doesn't matter.

43
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:13,477
Speaker 1: every man's our friends Every man is in their trench and they may fire bullets across the way, but that's about it.

44
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:23,499
Speaker 0: when you're old It doesn't matter if you remember your friends or not because everyone around you might as well be the same And then the people that you did know are mostly dead.

45
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,420
Speaker 0: It was a really depressing play.

46
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:39,653
Speaker 0: It was funny in the beginning It was funny at the end at a couple of points somewhat that bit that little bit of the Breakfast where McKellen's character just going on and on and on and the guys like bit early for all this, isn't it?

47
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:47,720
Speaker 0: I Didn't expect to laugh out loud as much as I did and then feel so such existential angst by the end of it.

48
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:52,393
Speaker 0: Don't become an old man Working on that or at least don't become an alcoholic old man.

49
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:54,020
Speaker 0: I feel like the two were combined.

50
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,080
Speaker 1: How much of that alcohol was alcohol?

51
00:03:56,984 --> 00:03:57,948
Speaker 1: What was it, you know?

52
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:05,573
Speaker 0: oftentimes because a lot of friends who are in theater I heard tell that in the last performance of plays that are like that.

53
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,058
Speaker 0: It'll be all real alcohol.

54
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:07,760
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

55
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:10,175
Speaker 1: If that's true, we gotta buy tickets again.

56
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,472
Speaker 1: No, dude, that's enough alcohol to send to the hospital.

57
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:17,058
Speaker 0: that was Hemingway level drinking.

58
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:28,610
Speaker 0: otherwise Bring me the bottle That there's a whole bit in the beginning where the Ian McAllen's just being kind of annoying and Patrick Stewart keeps Walking over and pouring himself more vodka.

59
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,179
Speaker 1: Why don't we make a stage production of?

60
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,134
Speaker 0: Like Sun Also Rises or whatever the Sun Also Rises stage production.

61
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,440
Speaker 0: I'm assuming that's been done.

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,400
Speaker 1: I'm assuming there's some shit musical about it and get totally and just all real wine all the time.

63
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:47,834
Speaker 0: You have a new cast real boys real bulls to new cast every time.

64
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,276
Speaker 1: That's right.

65
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:50,466
Speaker 1: new real bulls real wine Israel.

66
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,289
Speaker 0: That was actually a an assignment.

67
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:57,020
Speaker 0: I had to do in high school when we read real bulls and real wine.

68
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,887
Speaker 0: What are at what your assignment?

69
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:02,300
Speaker 1: drink seven bottles of wine when we did over the course of an hour?

70
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:02,862
Speaker 1: What do we did?

71
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,079
Speaker 1: our Hemingway said run away from some bulls and do it again?

72
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:18,200
Speaker 0: we had to keep track of how much alcohol people drank in different scenes and Determine what effect that would have on them and a lot of them ended in death death everyone All death no matter what human body they have.

73
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,760
Speaker 1: Even Andre the Giant would have been killed by that amount of alcohol.

74
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:28,015
Speaker 0: Yep, bottles and bottles and bottles, but so yeah, I digress in case you haven't been paying attention.

75
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:29,520
Speaker 0: The Ukraine is weak.

76
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,491
Speaker 1: No, I knew that in the 90s.

77
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:32,537
Speaker 0: Yeah.

78
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:45,440
Speaker 0: Well apparently that guy on the subway didn't know well, but If you kids a lot of you don't really pay attention to world news as far as I can tell Go read about what's going on in Ukraine.

79
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:56,385
Speaker 0: It's not really at the top of the news But basically the country is on the verge of like Les Miserables style collapse barricades in the streets Parliament fleeing Kiev.

80
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,550
Speaker 1: right here's baby's first explanation ready.

81
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:06,931
Speaker 1: the people who live in the eastern parts of the Ukraine voted for basically Soviet government effectively a Putin puppet if you will.

82
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:13,814
Speaker 1: the people in West Ukraine are totally chill and awesome And they voted for good people or at least relatively good people the West.

83
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,440
Speaker 0: let's work with the EU.

84
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,238
Speaker 1: Why are people who live more West anyway?

85
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott because people in Pennsylvania are so much smarter than people here.

86
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:27,160
Speaker 1: people in eastern, Pennsylvania are at least better than western, Pennsylvania.

87
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:32,859
Speaker 1: Not saying much though, it's like shit and diarrhea anyway.

88
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:40,160
Speaker 1: So yeah, the people in western Ukraine are totally chill But you know they're basically living under this shitty government the eastern people.

89
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:53,154
Speaker 1: Well, it's a little more complicated because it also goes heavily along urban rural delineations much like Right, but if you're the United States if you look at a map of like you know The the the states of the Ukraine and who they voted for.

90
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:57,774
Speaker 1: it's like two colors And it's not like the US or it's sort of like not a straight line.

91
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,140
Speaker 1: This is like a straight line down the middle.

92
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:01,199
Speaker 1: It's like oh all the ones in the wet, right?

93
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:05,335
Speaker 1: So they're super pissed that their government is all evil and corrupt and horrible.

94
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:06,420
Speaker 1: so they revolted.

95
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:08,983
Speaker 0: Well, it's it Revolted.

96
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:11,274
Speaker 0: there is a real revolution.

97
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:19,609
Speaker 0: There is Les Miserables riots and you know violence Militaries getting involved other countries getting involved.

98
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:21,473
Speaker 0: the UN will probably be involved.

99
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:30,278
Speaker 1: there might be NATO actions if this keeps escalating Right like going into the government building taking it over finding government people Doing violence upon them.

100
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:37,288
Speaker 0: if nothing else Look at the amazing Surprising images coming out of Ukraine.

101
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:39,980
Speaker 0: There's a photo that I saw people like to sit shit on fire there.

102
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,346
Speaker 1: Well, what is really popular?

103
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:43,756
Speaker 0: Well in a rioting Les Mis situation?

104
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,090
Speaker 0: That's your go-to Barricade fire fire fire barricade.

105
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:50,478
Speaker 1: Why don't they go for the ice be like, hey, it's Ukraine.

106
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:51,240
Speaker 1: We got more ice here.

107
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:51,882
Speaker 1: Let's do that.

108
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,957
Speaker 0: Ukraine is not northern Finland, but it's listen.

109
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:56,740
Speaker 1: It ain't warm.

110
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,355
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it is now but it's not like what they got on fire.

111
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,920
Speaker 1: it's not fucking Florida All right, but I saw one picture.

112
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:09,700
Speaker 0: there's basically this Barricade in the street and there's a man standing on top of it and it looks like the entire city is burning behind him.

113
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:22,114
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and then there's another picture that I would be good posted on Facebook of Basically people who live just in the suburbs like the equivalent of Queens Seeing the smoke rising out of the city center going.

114
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:23,199
Speaker 0: What the fuck is that?

115
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:31,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like you see these photos and you realize like man if I could just go you get like if you have any Interest in photography at all.

116
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,140
Speaker 1: you get this sort of idea Like I should go to a crazy place where shits going down and take photos.

117
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:39,849
Speaker 0: I was thinking that actually that is the worst idea.

118
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,815
Speaker 1: Well, I do not have that idea.

119
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:42,917
Speaker 1: It's a bad idea.

120
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:43,960
Speaker 0: an unnamed person.

121
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,019
Speaker 0: Well, you know what might be your job.

122
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,651
Speaker 0: Give you a journalist because the thing is that does not pay these.

123
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:49,880
Speaker 1: that is a job that makes you no money.

124
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,106
Speaker 1: You cannot live with that job.

125
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:54,040
Speaker 0: at least these pictures might generate world interest.

126
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:56,819
Speaker 0: Of course didn't really help serious so much.

127
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,200
Speaker 1: So you get lucky like one of your pictures might make you famous and then get you jobs doing other things in photography.

128
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,063
Speaker 1: That might make you money.

129
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:06,294
Speaker 0: remember that dumb anime flag about that picture of the flag.

130
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:06,394
Speaker 0: Yeah.

131
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,665
Speaker 1: Yeah Don't ever think that.

132
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:12,052
Speaker 0: so I a side anecdote.

133
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:18,611
Speaker 0: We have a friend who had a friend long time ago No names here And I got to an argument with that friend at an unnamed convention.

134
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:23,830
Speaker 0: and the argument that this person put to me Was that and he was being serious.

135
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:33,620
Speaker 0: It would be an actual tragedy if War ceased to occur because from where would we derive new war stories?

136
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:35,948
Speaker 1: We'd make them up.

137
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:39,554
Speaker 0: I Had a long debate that night.

138
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:50,676
Speaker 1: man It would be real problem if we stopped having the Middle Ages because no one's gonna write more Middle Ages if we actually develop Cyberpunk technology because then there wouldn't be any more cyberpunk stories.

139
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:55,480
Speaker 1: Yeah Wait, oh we can make stories about things that don't exist.

140
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:04,920
Speaker 1: Man it would really suck if there were no more Ancient Greeks is and we couldn't make up any more ancient Greeks.

141
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:12,069
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, but on that urban-rural divide which is also a big part of this I definitely did you see that thing?

142
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,720
Speaker 0: I tweeted of the United States GDP.

143
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:17,864
Speaker 0: No, okay.

144
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:29,120
Speaker 0: This this is one of the most amazing maps you'll ever see because this really Explains a lot of what's happening in Turkey in Ukraine trying to pull the map up again so I can show discuss.

145
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,025
Speaker 0: So basically it's the United States.

146
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:39,820
Speaker 0: I'm just a map of the United States and as two colors one color Represents 50% of the GDP of the United States geography.

147
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:48,635
Speaker 1: So it's like it's like tiny dots around New York and some other cities and one other color represents the other 50% entire rest of the country.

148
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:56,519
Speaker 0: Yes It's basically tiny little brown regions around the places you'd expect and the entire rest of the country is yellow, right?

149
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,100
Speaker 1: In other words, we're all you know us people who live in cities and actually do real work.

150
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,119
Speaker 1: We're basically paying for you to exist.

151
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,513
Speaker 0: In other words, here's the map.

152
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:06,400
Speaker 1: we should be in charge.

153
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:07,760
Speaker 0: Look at that map.

154
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:14,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically it's almost the same as what the map would be if you looked at Democrat versus Republican voters, right?

155
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:19,719
Speaker 1: in other words Anyone who lives in the orange should have a vote and anyone lives in the blue does not.

156
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,385
Speaker 0: oh So you're saying only rich people should vote?

157
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,152
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying only people.

158
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,356
Speaker 1: it's not people who have money.

159
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:25,420
Speaker 1: It's people who produce.

160
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:29,370
Speaker 0: Well, oh, so it's the job created.

161
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,040
Speaker 1: It's the GDP not the how much money to have in your bank account.

162
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,960
Speaker 1: It's how much money did you bring into the country?

163
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:40,415
Speaker 1: right the same way that your parents are the boss of the house because they bring in money.

164
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:45,376
Speaker 1: when you say we should buy a Nintendo they say you don't get to make any decisions because you're just some kid who didn't make any money.

165
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:49,620
Speaker 1: and then when you get A job you can say I'm gonna buy a Nintendo and they can't say no because you earn them.

166
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,425
Speaker 0: Well until you're 18, they can still say no Whatever.

167
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:59,266
Speaker 0: yeah tough shit, of course, that's me Kids, I know a lot of you're in high school So I'm gonna let you in on a secret.

168
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:03,606
Speaker 0: once you're 18, you can sign your fucking self out of school Mm-hmm.

169
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,480
Speaker 0: So remember that use it.

170
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:11,858
Speaker 0: I signed myself out of school to the rolled eyes and sigh of the secretary in the eye.

171
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:23,266
Speaker 0: in the Administration office like once a week once I turned 18 I was just like round and decoster has a doctor's appointment and I signed it and they're like really You have a doctor's appointment.

172

173
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,020
Speaker 0: I'm an adult and I signed this.

174
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,925
Speaker 1: I went to the doctor.

175
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,594
Speaker 1: Um, I made my own doctor's appointment.

176
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:30,680
Speaker 1: I called the doctor.

177
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:31,524
Speaker 1: What do you get?

178
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:32,610
Speaker 1: doesn't matter if I'm lying?

179
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was lying.

180
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,710
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do about it one time?

181
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,076
Speaker 0: I just why I said something.

182
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:39,980
Speaker 0: I just stopped giving a reason.

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,079
Speaker 0: I was like Brandon girls needs to leave school Got something signed by myself.

184
00:12:48,928 --> 00:12:52,728
Speaker 1: In other news We lost at ice disc today.

185
00:12:52,748 --> 00:13:14,500
Speaker 1: Yeah in some disc with a K captain It's this with a C. No Disc or the K is only for like floppy disk or hard disk Like a discus that an Olympian throws is a C and a compact disc is a C. Pretty much any other kind of disc is also a C except for a floppy disc.

186
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:21,022
Speaker 0: there was some debate on Twitter about this the same out by someone the same way that a Trackball.

187
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:24,920
Speaker 1: only the Atari trackball does not have the letter C is a TR AK ball.

188
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:28,888
Speaker 1: Every other trackball is here a CK Track balls.

189
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:31,044
Speaker 1: you can still get one Yeah, but I don't.

190
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:34,959
Speaker 0: I used to seem around a lot in the 90s and now I almost never see him.

191
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:40,713
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's the people sort of you know There's still some crazy nuts out there who think a trackball is like good idea.

192
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,160
Speaker 0: There's a couple of uses.

193
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,978
Speaker 0: So our mutual friends got played quake and mega TF with a trackball instead of a mouse.

194
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:51,269
Speaker 0: great He was as good as me if not better.

195
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,812
Speaker 0: Whatever.

196
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:54,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't see anyone doing that Trackball.

197
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:57,460
Speaker 1: you should have seen no one in the Pro Circuit today is doing that.

198
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:58,063
Speaker 0: I want to.

199
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,500
Speaker 1: you can't tell me a laser mouse is less accurate than that laser trackball.

200
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:03,365
Speaker 1: It's not gonna help you.

201
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:07,200
Speaker 0: I want to see a dude with like an eight ball at one of these tournaments.

202
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:10,981
Speaker 0: That would be the walls cuz they'll lose It.

203
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:19,085
Speaker 1: basically it died the way the Devorah keyboard and the split ergonomic keyboard should die because they'd all just as bullshit Ergonomically speaking.

204
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess the trackball actually died.

205
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:22,967
Speaker 1: Whatever.

206
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:24,820
Speaker 1: so anyway news that was the news.

207
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, we lost at the ice puck, but you know what and we lost.

208
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,512
Speaker 1: bullshit.

209
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,999
Speaker 1: refs frigging, you know, score the final goal.

210
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:35,835
Speaker 1: You know, that's okay because you Canadians you lose.

211
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:40,123
Speaker 1: used up all your luck today and You got none left.

212
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,645
Speaker 1: it's gonna be GG.

213
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:47,806
Speaker 1: so enjoy it for the next like I don't know 14 hours or whatever.

214
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:55,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait wait until some Canadian team wins the Stanley Cup next year and you and you Know what if we lose tomorrow?

215
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,727
Speaker 1: Then at least I had the balls to trash.

216
00:14:58,747 --> 00:14:59,409
Speaker 1: talk in advance.

217
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:00,011
Speaker 1: I'm like rim.

218
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:01,034
Speaker 1: rim never does that.

219
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:05,684
Speaker 0: sometimes I do Sometimes I do and you know what it's rare.

220
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:07,787
Speaker 1: They're probably listening to this after that game is completed.

221
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:14,275
Speaker 1: Anyway, if we win that game I was right suck it.

222
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,379
Speaker 1: You should have let us win today and you could have maybe one tomorrow.

223
00:15:20,341 --> 00:15:21,888
Speaker 1: But the refs they already gave you the.

224
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,113
Speaker 1: you already cashed in your favor.

225
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,660
Speaker 0: I would love to see what would happen.

226
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:25,944
Speaker 0: I know it can't happen.

227
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:37,000
Speaker 0: I know it's impossible to happen if NHL teams played by Olympic rules just once one year Can you imagine the announcers during the hockey games actually been discussing a lot how like the NHL ice is too small?

228
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:44,391
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah And the Olympic ice is too big that in Finland and I think Norway or something They actually have like this in-between ice size.

229
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,460
Speaker 1: that is like the best ice size.

230
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:54,335
Speaker 1: It makes the game like, you know, it gives like enough room to like, you know, really show off your skills You know without being cramped in thing is I like?

231
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:59,174
Speaker 1: it's also Tight enough that you can actually get more action instead of like the puck goes around.

232
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,980
Speaker 0: I like wide hockey.

233
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,292
Speaker 0: I like four on four hockey even more.

234
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, like four four, but yeah They're talking about like.

235
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:07,710
Speaker 1: the best ice size is this in-between size.

236
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:12,083
Speaker 0: Anyway, what if you go bigger and have like 20 on 20?

237
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:20,951
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know Olympic hockey is pretty much the best Sport there is so You don't have too many opportunities to watch it.

238
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,059
Speaker 1: and tomorrow is the day.

239
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,760
Speaker 1: Basically, there's two games tomorrow Sweden Finland and US Canada.

240
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:33,369
Speaker 1: Whoever wins those two games goes to the gold medal game in Which is Sunday the gold medal game.

241
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,614
Speaker 1: if you win you get a gold medal.

242
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:36,059
Speaker 1: you lose silver medal.

243
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:41,148
Speaker 1: So bad the two teams that lose tomorrow Still get to play.

244
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,759
Speaker 1: they go to the bronze medal game.

245
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,410
Speaker 1: You win the bronze medal game you get a bronze medal.

246
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,237
Speaker 1: if you lose you get shit.

247
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:50,613
Speaker 0: who's the comedian I think was Jerry Seinfeld who said that you want the gold.

248
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:55,659
Speaker 0: obviously, that's what you're shooting for But if you're not gonna get the gold you're better off with the bronze.

249
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,996
Speaker 0: Well, at least and here's his argument if you win the gold, you're the champion of the world.

250
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:00,880
Speaker 0: fuck everybody.

251
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:07,138
Speaker 0: If you win the silver, you're the guy who didn't win the gold, but if you win the bronze, hey, I got a medal.

252
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:09,528
Speaker 0: That was his argument.

253
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,444
Speaker 0: at least that was in the same album I believe.

254
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:21,972
Speaker 1: if I was in charge of the Olympics I would eliminate all bronze and silver medals and I would eliminate the gold medal - there'd be a platinum medal for the winner And everyone else gets nothing cuz everyone else gets shot.

255
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:23,579
Speaker 1: Second place is the first loser.

256
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:26,616
Speaker 0: You know in Science Olympiad, they did something interesting.

257
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:27,280
Speaker 1: End of story.

258
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,014
Speaker 0: I think they still do it because there'd be like 40 you're either the best or you're nobody.

259
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:43,700
Speaker 0: so Science Olympiads in high schools We have 40 or 50 high schools and like the regional tournaments for whatever They usually have eight places that got medals because you got a medal if the thing was worth points for qualifying for state or nationals.

260
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:53,700
Speaker 0: So medal meant you counted four points And then there was a meta score for your high school or your country or whatever if they want to give out like multiple awards.

261
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,320
Speaker 1: The way you need to do it is the way the bicycle races do it, right?

262
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,353
Speaker 1: It's like you can win the bicycle race and win But like if you get up the mountain first you get the red and white dots.

263
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:07,671
Speaker 1: and it's like only the people who are the Best at something get something but it you don't get anything.

264
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:13,111
Speaker 1: if you weren't the number one in some category Number two people like I was the second guy up the mountain.

265
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:14,015
Speaker 1: You don't get shit.

266
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:15,060
Speaker 1: I finished the race second.

267
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:16,746
Speaker 1: You don't get shit, right?

268
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:20,120
Speaker 1: We only give out jerseys and medals to people who are first.

269
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:26,738
Speaker 0: That's also why I think some people enjoy like marathons those kind of long things because then there's almost this place of.

270
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:27,982
Speaker 0: I Finished it.

271
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:29,527
Speaker 0: I made it to the end.

272
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:31,073
Speaker 1: Did you finish it first?

273
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:32,036
Speaker 1: who fucking cares?

274
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:33,260
Speaker 0: I'm so you lost.

275
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,015
Speaker 0: So shut up, you're a loser.

276
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:40,527
Speaker 0: You wanna play some nidhag Olympic nidhag at least.

277
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,556
Speaker 1: nidhag only gives a win to the guy in first.

278
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:55,726
Speaker 0: Yeah No problems there but anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day.

279
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:57,875
Speaker 1: I do you know the.

280
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:03,047
Speaker 1: the Commodore 64 Has a famous Audio chip in it the CID.

281
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:08,627
Speaker 1: right my machine supremacy has used it Famously as among many other people.

282
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:23,184
Speaker 1: it has a particular sound that is pretty unique amongst digital audio mechanisms and it has been said that that sound cannot be perfectly reproduced in software and even The way it works.

283
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:30,627
Speaker 1: every CID chip, you know, even though they're all the same chip is unique in its own Slightly varied way, but you know what the reality is.

284
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:35,600
Speaker 1: you can basically make that sound with software and your computer, right?

285
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,080
Speaker 1: It'll be 99% the same and I dare anyone to tell the difference.

286
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:47,639
Speaker 1: But where can you get software that does that, you know, you can get a Commodore 64 emulator and write software for it But that's a pain in the ass.

287
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:52,460
Speaker 1: This website, I think it this is like some HTML 5 website.

288
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:56,720
Speaker 1: I don't think they make this in JavaScript or something, but it's pretty crazy.

289
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,587
Speaker 1: But yeah, it has all the control.

290
00:19:59,607 --> 00:20:04,780
Speaker 1: It's like a little keyboard like a musical keyboard not a you know computer keyboard.

291
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:14,924
Speaker 1: You could actually plug in a musical keyboard to a Commodore 64 and all the controls for the CID chip and you can Play musics on it.

292
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:16,167
Speaker 0: Not too shabby.

344
00:23:59,725 --> 00:23:59,952
Speaker 0: That's it.

345
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:04,616

348
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,339
Speaker 0: They're back-to-back in different rooms.

349
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:25,663
Speaker 0: So we're gonna cut off fundamental anime a little early and run the secret guide to running panels on Saturday noon and not all Anime are what they seem on Saturday at 2 30.

350
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:29,918
Speaker 0: The rest of that time will be hanging out in sports bars and playing German board games.

351
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,748
Speaker 1: shortly Afterwards is PAX East.

352
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:35,055
Speaker 1: if you don't have a ticket you ain't going.

353
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,580
Speaker 0: we will be presenting.

354
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,837
Speaker 0: No, I was about to say the wrong panel name why no one will game with you.

355
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:42,620
Speaker 0: Would you suck?

356
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:51,052
Speaker 1: And cuz you didn't get a ticket to PAX East and you can't play games if you're not there And the panel let's play games.

357
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,358
Speaker 1: Oh Anyone who's in this room?

358
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:56,231
Speaker 1: You don't need to hear this panel because people will play games with you.

359
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:56,893
Speaker 1: because you're here.

360
00:24:57,516 --> 00:25:01,154
Speaker 1: everyone who's not at this Convention no one will play games with you.

361
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:16,680
Speaker 0: I will say this We for a long time had a philosophy of having titles of panels that were perhaps inflammatory Controversial, I think this started with our gecky guy Colin putting the man back in manga.

362
00:25:17,464 --> 00:25:20,440
Speaker 0: So while we're bringing that tradition back, what's this a panel about?

363
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:28,064
Speaker 1: You'll find out your mom I'm gonna insult you could to make you go away So I don't have to play.

364
00:25:28,345 --> 00:25:33,414
Speaker 0: we're actually gonna go through the room person by person Interview them and then tell them why we won't play games with them.

365
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:41,440
Speaker 1: That's right Because you don't know the rules because you're slow because you don't speak English because I don't like you because you're ugly.

366
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:45,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you're not ugly ugly smelly ugly ugly smelly smelly ugly.

367
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:47,706
Speaker 0: No, it's gonna be a good panel.

368
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,353
Speaker 0: It's actually a complex topic.

369
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,538
Speaker 0: Whatever you'll see it.

370
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:51,080
Speaker 0: It'll be awesome.

371
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:53,891
Speaker 0: We're gonna be a zenk icon doing a bunch of panels.

372
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:54,655
Speaker 0: I forget what.

373
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:55,760
Speaker 1: I gotta let me go into this.

374
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,809
Speaker 0: I think we're doing anime openers for around the world.

375
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:02,300
Speaker 0: I think we're doing all anime are the same convention season if you haven't noticed.

376
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, a kinetic on.

377
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:05,997
Speaker 0: Submit your fucking panels.

378
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,007
Speaker 0: We're Best yep.

379
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,223
Speaker 1: Oh One slight news.

380
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:13,247
Speaker 1: We're not going to this.

381
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:14,511
Speaker 0: That's not public.

382
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,196
Speaker 0: We can't talk about that.

383
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:16,979
Speaker 1: What about what?

384
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:19,833
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what you're about to talk about.

385
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:20,780
Speaker 1: the New York Comic Con.

386
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,843
Speaker 0: Okay, we can talk about that.

387
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,270
Speaker 1: May is gonna make another convention.

388
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:30,940
Speaker 1: That's also the New York Comic Con Yeah, but it's basically the Philly wizard world variant, right?

389
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,994
Speaker 1: So basically because the New York Comic Con has no comics at it anymore.

390
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:35,120
Speaker 1: It's all movies and bullshit.

391
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,746
Speaker 1: But they're still gonna call it comic-con.

392
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:40,500
Speaker 1: They're making a separate comic-con on a different day like in the summer.

393
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:52,520
Speaker 1: That's gonna actually be just comics which means that one is actually also gonna be called New York Comic Con Special Edition or some shit and it's gonna basically end up being a Philly wizard world because it's comics only.

394
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:56,694
Speaker 0: No, it might be Philly wizard world with I mean song of mocha for that.

395
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:58,660
Speaker 1: I mean wizard world is everywhere.

396
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,720
Speaker 1: It's not just in Philly, but it's gonna be a crappy.

397
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:04,613
Speaker 1: You know bunch of tables really sad guys selling back issues.

398
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,182
Speaker 0: when we say Philly wizard was an artist alley You know what?

399
00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:07,745
Speaker 0: I'll link to it.

400
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:10,460
Speaker 0: I'll link to the show we did on Philly wizard world, right?

401
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,640
Speaker 1: It's.

402
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:15,096
Speaker 1: it's just like every other comic show, you know a few sad comic.

403
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:21,413
Speaker 0: now a lot of people said Oh, it'll probably have a lot of that indie mocha stuff, but you know Virgil sitting in the corner You know what given any autographs?

404
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:25,537
Speaker 0: I We go to mocha still even though it's you know, the side of illustrators and everything.

405
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:38,027
Speaker 0: now I've been to SPX and what I saw at SPX was that a lot of the people who used to go to mocha and stopped hated mocha always hated it and only go to SPX.

406
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:48,099
Speaker 0: and the main reason is that New York fucking sucks to go to a convention Unless you are wealthy and you live here or you live here.

407
00:27:48,924 --> 00:27:53,519
Speaker 0: So unless the indie comedy people live here It sucks for them to go to comic because they're poor.

408
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:56,593
Speaker 0: Also because it sucks to go to conventions in New York City.

409
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,099
Speaker 0: what you can go to some venue.

410
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,051
Speaker 0: That's not really a good fit in Manhattan where no one can afford a hotel.

411
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:06,319
Speaker 0: or you go to the Javits where there's fucking nothing There and no way to get there.

412
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,660
Speaker 0: No subway barely any buses no cabs unless you're going to the airport and no hotels.

413
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,898
Speaker 1: While you know build corrupt Convention Center near Airport.

414
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:16,986
Speaker 0: why Seriously, New York.

415
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,520
Speaker 1: Everyone else used their corruption to build shit.

416
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,908
Speaker 1: Why don't we use our corruption to build something we need?

417
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,839
Speaker 0: if we built something like the BCEC in Boston or the?

418
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,537
Speaker 0: BCC in Baltimore in like flushing there would be a PAX there.

419
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:33,049
Speaker 0: I bet Thanks would have been there instead of Boston.

420
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:45,833
Speaker 1: Imagine you fly to JFK you take the air train boom you're at the Convention Center this hotels there and Amazing New York food and after the convention is done you can take the Way for 250 to go to Manhattan and enjoy the rest of your vacation.

421
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:46,916
Speaker 0: non New Yorkers take note.

422
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:51,220
Speaker 0: flushing you might think oh That's like way on the end of the seven line like way out in Queens.

423
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:52,553
Speaker 0: Flushing is a.

424

00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:45,310
Speaker 0: yeah, that's a common thing.

439
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,860
Speaker 0: There's a Wikipedia article about you play hockey.

440
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:51,020
Speaker 0: No, but I'm like worried about like I got to go to the dentist.

441
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,172
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about it a lot, but I'm still trying to find a dentist and schedule.

442
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,200
Speaker 1: Okay, you just go to the dentist.

443
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:58,140
Speaker 1: I went to because my co-workers all recommended it.

444
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,440
Speaker 0: I think my new insurance will cover it and I went there and it's basically the bestest dentist ever.

445
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:11,366
Speaker 1: It's all super modern with like the highest technologies and they'll email you a confirmation and it's like yeah, this is for real That's kind of a meta point.

446
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:18,013
Speaker 0: that because I've realized this because you said that about your dentist Emily said that about her doctor and then independently when I got my Google last thing.

447
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:24,840
Speaker 0: I went to an optician that was like this Most doctors offices are run by old people who don't know shit about technology.

448
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,599
Speaker 1: Okay, what I think it really is is that any any kind of any any sort of office like that, you know?

449
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:34,425
Speaker 1: Mostly medical offices But really almost anything right.

450
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:34,625
Speaker 1: any.

451
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:43,460
Speaker 1: any small business when the business opens will have the latest and greatest technology of when it opens But then it will not upgrade unless it is absolutely necessary.

452
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,847
Speaker 1: So you feel like an old restaurant.

453
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:47,620
Speaker 1: it'll have like a cash register, but you've got a new restaurant.

454
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,739
Speaker 1: It'll be all like whoosh digital, you know systems putting in orders and everything, right?

455
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,460
Speaker 1: But this they'll never upgrade it because there's no reason to upgrade it.

456
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,829
Speaker 1: They have a system that works.

457
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,604
Speaker 1: as long as that system continues to work They will never change it.

458
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:04,016
Speaker 1: So the dentist I went to is a really freaking new dentist.

459
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:05,140
Speaker 1: It's super fancy.

460
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:12,034
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna remain at its current level of fanciness For as long as it exists and it probably won't upgrade ever unless it has to.

461
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:15,046
Speaker 1: so if you go to a dentist who's like Been around for 30 years.

462
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:20,055
Speaker 1: They have really good dentist experience probably probably really good at dentisting But they're probably using.

463
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:26,180
Speaker 1: you know Like Matt the dentist chairs are probably like 10 years old and they probably don't not gonna email you anything ever.

464
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:30,583
Speaker 0: I'm not not even just that kind of stuff like the you know Have like.

465
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:34,866
Speaker 0: they send you a calendar invite like basic shit like that I'm talking like most up.

466
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:53,338
Speaker 0: a lot of people I know have been to opticians that still in the year 25 20 the year 2014 Will manually with that big crazy looking thing that you put in front of your face Rotate a bunch of lenses and dials around and manually figure out your prescription instead of having the laser computer.

467
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,562
Speaker 0: Just do it They'll.

468
00:31:55,884 --> 00:32:03,180
Speaker 1: they won't actually like do any sort of Expensive piece of equipment and they already have a piece of equipment that works and gets the job done.

469
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:07,820
Speaker 1: So it's a job done kinda right, but how much money are they gonna spend to upgrade to that other thing?

470
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're starting off as a new optician.

471
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have your loan that you've taken out to start your business.

472
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,240
Speaker 0: Oh, so, let me tell you but if you're an old business It's like you don't have that the more modern opticians with the more modern stuff also charge about half what the old men charge.

473
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:23,233
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

474
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,930
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm doing a little bit of investigative journalism here.

475
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:33,260
Speaker 0: So the moral is Our health care system is so fucked up that most people don't get to pick.

476
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:47,900
Speaker 0: because if if you could pick Freely what doctor and dentist and optician everyone you went to I think a lot of these old Style places would go out of business and there'd actually be pressure to modernize because there'd be actual competition.

477
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:54,723
Speaker 0: the problem is there's no competition because most people their HMO or whatever is like you can go to these five doctors and four of Them aren't taking fish.

478
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:58,680
Speaker 1: I think the real problem is not just you know, it's like I can pick from quite a few, right?

479
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,417
Speaker 1: It's like I can't go to anyone I want in the whole universe, but there's a lot of choices.

480
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:02,900
Speaker 1: leave for Dennis.

481
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:03,745
Speaker 1: I can actually go anywhere.

482
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:03,987
Speaker 1: I want.

483
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,375
Speaker 0: there's no way to compare them though.

484
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,100
Speaker 1: How do you compare them?

485
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,108
Speaker 1: You go make an appointment.

486
00:33:07,128 --> 00:33:08,096
Speaker 1: Well, that was your appointment.

487
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,032
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, why would you ever go make an appointment somewhere else?

488
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,780
Speaker 1: and then yeah, I have to make another appointment.

489
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:14,390
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't I go to the place?

490
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:14,974
Speaker 1: I already went.

491
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:18,016
Speaker 0: that already has records All right, so there's 20 doctors over the course of 20 years.

492
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,920
Speaker 0: I get a physical at each one to see which one's better and meanwhile that the first one you tried.

493
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:23,824
Speaker 1: It was 20 years ago.

494
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:25,110
Speaker 1: Who knows if they're even still around.

495
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I need to be able to you know.

496
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,937
Speaker 1: How do you how do you chop around and figure out which ones I want to go to?

497
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:31,480
Speaker 1: the reviews?

498
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,394
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of legalities around doctor reviews that they don't have on restaurant reviews, right?

499
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,120
Speaker 1: Yep, so it's weird.

500
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:41,453
Speaker 0: It's all weird and messed up and American health care is just fucked right?

501
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,316
Speaker 0: I digress.

502
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:43,300
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah dentists thing.

503
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:46,724
Speaker 1: So I hope you brush your teeth Floss your teeth.

504
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:49,760
Speaker 0: Yeah guys brush your teeth at least twice, right?

505
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,555
Speaker 1: But it's like a lot of people they're scared to go to the dentist for some reason.

506
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,821
Speaker 0: I think I think it's simple Everyone's.

507
00:33:56,941 --> 00:34:10,768
Speaker 0: the people who are scared to go to the dentist are the same 40 year old men who don't go to get their colonoscopy they don't want to find out that something's wrong and they don't go to the doctor or dentist or anything until they're forced to by Crippling pain or months of blood.

508
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,800
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it is is that if you go to like a doctor, right?

509
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:21,800
Speaker 1: people some people are scared of the doctor too, but it's like in terms of things the doctor will do to you when you go To him it's like it might poke you with a needle.

510
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,547
Speaker 0: Yep, right turn your head and cough.

511
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:26,040
Speaker 1: if you go to a dentist pull your shirt up, right?

512
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,981
Speaker 1: And you know what?

513
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:32,219
Speaker 1: That's rather unlikely and not often most of the dentist that most doctor visits and really nothing happens.

514
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,428
Speaker 1: That's anything that could be painful, right?

515
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:38,100
Speaker 1: It's just like they talk to you and they you know stethoscope and whatever.

516
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:44,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you go to a dentist It's actually somewhat likely that they are going to do something to you.

517
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:46,239
Speaker 1: That will not hurt, right?

518
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,672
Speaker 1: It's like I got all drilled today and it was probably the least painful.

519
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,036
Speaker 1: whatever I didn't feel shit.

520
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:52,000
Speaker 0: You got the shot.

521
00:34:52,702 --> 00:34:53,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even feel the shot.

522
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:55,172
Speaker 1: I mean, what did they do?

523
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:56,396
Speaker 0: the tap first or the other?

524
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:59,020
Speaker 0: It's not actually a shot It's just like the numbing gel that comes right there.

525
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:04,559
Speaker 1: So usually the procedure nowadays is they put goop on a q-tip and then they put the shot where the goop was.

526
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:11,829
Speaker 1: so goop is like basically like topical antiseptic Topical anesthetic and then they put the shot.

527
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,033
Speaker 1: there is you don't feel the shot.

528
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:23,160
Speaker 1: That's making you even more numb, but whatever It's like I you know when I was in Australia They just gave me the shot straight in the chin and it didn't even that hurt a little bit, but whatever.

529
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you had a. you had a sizable gash in your chin at the time.

530
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, so maybe your nerves I've had it.

531
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,114
Speaker 1: I've had it in my lip before too.

532
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,723
Speaker 1: It's like I think I'm pretty much This is the doctor show.

533
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:33,727
Speaker 0: cuz it's the doctor show.

534
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:34,790
Speaker 0: we're gonna talk about shots.

535
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:37,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, my I've gotten some fucking shots.

536
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but the boys people are scared of dentists.

537
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:47,676
Speaker 1: cuz actually rather likely that a dentist will use implements on you That are frightening such as drills.

538
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:55,920
Speaker 1: It's like I'm going to drill your body that it would like a high-speed spinning thing That is usually used on like wood and you know heart.

539
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,380
Speaker 1: It's like they're gonna take the hardware store to your mouth and it's like the concept of that Can be alarming coupled with I think the secondary effects.

540
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,496
Speaker 0: I mean, even if it doesn't hurt if they're drilling your tooth you smell burning tooth.

541
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:08,660
Speaker 1: I didn't smell any burning tooth.

542
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,631
Speaker 0: I do if they do a proper drill.

543
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,099
Speaker 0: I've smelled burning tooth before.

544
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,632
Speaker 0: I guess it depends on what they're drilling out.

545
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:18,080
Speaker 1: really what it's all about that You want high-speed drills, right?

546
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,284
Speaker 1: Cuz the high-speed drill.

547
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:23,200
Speaker 0: well once again you wanna go to a modern dentist will not like vibrate your head, right?

548
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:28,580
Speaker 0: Kind of like how there's all those different kinds of fillings and everything.

549
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:32,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, you really these days you should go with the composite filling.

550
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:33,400
Speaker 0: it depends.

551
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:38,020
Speaker 0: I've still read the composite only last 10 to 15 years before they might need to be replaced.

552
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:42,640
Speaker 0: But good old amalgam will last 25 plus amalgam will poison you with mercury.

553
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:44,611
Speaker 0: No, actually, there's no evidence that it does.

554
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:46,220
Speaker 1: It's such a small amount of mercury.

555
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,424
Speaker 0: No, it's actually.

556
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,973
Speaker 0: every study I've ever found says that it doesn't.

557
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:52,180
Speaker 1: I just said it is a such a small.

558
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:59,220
Speaker 0: Get it drilled out and replaced with something else drilling it out will release a bunch of mercury.

559
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:02,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I've got a bunch of amalgam filming fillings in the back of my mouth.

560
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,370
Speaker 1: I have one amalgam filling the rest are the composite kind.

561
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,956
Speaker 1: they've lasted way longer than 10 15 years.

562
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:10,014
Speaker 0: Well, I mean we're talking about dentists.

563
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:14,370
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into orthodontia But this another episode we could do we good.

564
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,579
Speaker 0: I got braces twice me, too.

565
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:25,480
Speaker 0: So total of eight and a half years of braces between the two times I don't know how many years total and that actually caused some issues in my teeth that affect me to this day.

566
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,525
Speaker 0: So I've had a lot more.

567
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:29,198
Speaker 1: at least you had it and you're not one of those people the fucked up mouth.

568
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,713
Speaker 1: So Actually, you want to know something really sad like micro who like his mouth is fucked up to this day.

569
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:54,640
Speaker 0: one of the most direct And trivial way to determine in the West Whether or not a person was born into the middle of the middle class or up is whether or not they have straight teeth Not perfect teeth but straight teeth because orthodontia is not really accessible to people in the lower end of middle class and down.

570
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,825
Speaker 1: Oh, that shit is expensive.

571
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:58,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the odds are that almost everyone will need orthodontia.

572
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:05,400
Speaker 0: So as a result someone who has mostly straight teeth was probably born into a middle-class family.

573
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:06,683
Speaker 0: It's just.

574
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:11,964
Speaker 0: it's one of those things that might not be true in the far future but in this current day is Definitely true.

575
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:14,232
Speaker 1: So let's talk about dental procedures, right?

576
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,200
Speaker 1: So first obviously there's the cleaning.

577
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:16,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

578
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:21,159
Speaker 1: I've had Dennis clean my teeth in at least three different ways.

579
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:22,123
Speaker 1: Right way.

580
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:33,225
Speaker 1: number one is like the old-fashioned way where first they go with the metal picks and they go scratchy scratchy scratchy Yeah, remove all the tartar and then they have the rubber thing that polishes like Right, that's way number one.

581
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:36,814
Speaker 1: and then occasionally the fluoride afterwards thing that's usually when you're younger.

582
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,258
Speaker 1: they do that way.

583
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:41,399
Speaker 1: number two They do the scratchy scratchy a bit, right?

584
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:51,083
Speaker 1: But they use basically a sandblaster except it's sort of a saltwater kind of thing right and That works.

585
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:56,300
Speaker 1: and then the place I went to now right, you know, they did a little bit of metal picking or whatever.

586
00:38:56,862 --> 00:39:04,040
Speaker 1: But actually the thing they used it wasn't a sandblasting saltwater It was a sonic vibrating just water.

587
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:11,430
Speaker 1: But it was all like so sonic that all the tartar like it shatters Right because it's like a very tiny screaming opera person.

588
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that was that was the third method.

589
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,588
Speaker 1: I'm not sure which method I like the most.

590
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:21,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I find the cleanings to be less pleasant than the actual procedures.

591
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 0: Hmm you'd rather have a drilling than a cleaning because the drilling is What the actual active fucking around in my mouth doesn't take that long.

592
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,314
Speaker 0: It's love just waiting for the amalgam to see waiting for this waiting for that.

593
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:38,759
Speaker 0: It's easier, I guess.

594
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:41,779
Speaker 0: But at the same time I'm not bothered by that sort of thing.

595
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:48,000
Speaker 0: Like I remember my mom was always freaked out by not the pain because remember in the old days dentistry was a lot more painful.

596
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:50,887
Speaker 1: We are lucky in our day they have.

597
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:55,640
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, even that the local anesthetic has changed between different kinds.

598
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:58,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the kind you get now is way better.

599
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,505
Speaker 0: I mean the old ones used to burn before they stopped before they numb to be like And then it would go away.

600
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:04,932
Speaker 1: Yeah now it's like at worst.

601
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:09,803
Speaker 1: you feel the pressure of the injection And I remember this sound distinctly as if you got Significant work.

602
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:21,192
Speaker 0: the shot that used to give you was like up into the roof of your mouth and it would make this like sickly Crunching noise and you feel it But you wouldn't feel like you wouldn't feel pain.

603
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,699
Speaker 0: You just feel like it going in.

604
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:24,976
Speaker 0: That really that messed a lot of people up.

605
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:28,640
Speaker 0: I think Yeah, so that might be part of it that you can't see what they're doing.

606
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,600
Speaker 0: If you're getting stitches, you can at least watch him doing it and the kind of removes that sort of existential mystery horror.

607
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,100
Speaker 0: But in your mouth, there's a guy with a drill and now you can't see the drill and you smell burning and you see him Doing stuff and you feel it in there.

608
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,649
Speaker 1: There's seen even a lot of people who are really pussies because a lot of the dentists I know Including the one I'm going to now.

609
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:49,379
Speaker 1: It's like they'll for extra money.

610
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:54,300
Speaker 1: They'll give you the gas and it seems like a lot of people are just so sissy that they go for it depends.

611
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,244
Speaker 0: I got the gas.

612
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:56,008
Speaker 0: I got a light.

613
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:56,952
Speaker 1: I've never gotten the gas.

614
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:58,520
Speaker 0: I got the non knockout gas.

615
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,180
Speaker 0: I've never had any gas when I had to get a pretty substantial drilling.

616
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,840
Speaker 1: There is no reason to risk any gas because the gas itself is risky.

617
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:09,230
Speaker 0: Well, it depends and general anesthesia is risky.

618
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:12,740
Speaker 0: just nitrous oxide not super risky it's still somewhat risky.

619
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:21,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got it because I had a drilling that was pretty substantial and he was worried that he was gonna hit nerve And he didn't want to risk all that pain.

620
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,933
Speaker 1: So he was like look Well, the real reason is like they don't actually care if you feel pain.

621
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:26,480
Speaker 1: that this is Dennis doesn't feel it.

622
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,580
Speaker 1: I care the prop that the reason they care is because if you feel a pain your body will go.

623
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:39,240
Speaker 1: Ah, right, you'll move and like pull away and move your head Another human being to feel pain and they might like drill into your cheek.

624
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:47,735
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure if you said I want to feel the pain they'd be like I'm okay If you want to feel the pain But I'm not okay with you jerking your head and the me.

625
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,560
Speaker 1: I got your face.

626
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:54,529
Speaker 0: I had two cavities drilled out once when I was a teenager with no anesthesia Whoa, and the dentist didn't give a shit.

627
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:56,600
Speaker 0: No because he was like probably not gonna hit a nerve.

628
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:01,540
Speaker 0: He was like tell me if it hurts because they were trying to avoid giving anesthesia for whatever reason if they could.

629
00:42:01,741 --> 00:42:03,380
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm as I remember that very distinct.

630
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:06,900
Speaker 1: It's like just a little bit and it's only in but I'll tell you an animal part of the tooth.

631
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,680
Speaker 0: It was a lot of not hurting but then he hit something once and there was this tweet.

632
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,079
Speaker 0: It felt like a line just went through my tooth into my brain.

633
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,102
Speaker 1: That's how it is.

634
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:20,072
Speaker 0: I went under once for a dental procedure completely.

635
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,118
Speaker 1: what the hell did they do to you?

636
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:22,640
Speaker 0: wisdom teeth?

637
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,966
Speaker 0: Oh, I had to get you know, I have wisdom teeth all of them.

638
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:26,527
Speaker 0: Yep.

639
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:27,610
Speaker 0: You're a crazy aberration.

640
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:34,346
Speaker 1: They took it because when I was doing orthodontia, which you're not supposed to talk about The teeth directly behind me.

641
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,771
Speaker 0: Oh you already got some teeth taken out.

642
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:38,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was with local anesthesia though.

643
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,992
Speaker 0: No, yeah, cuz the front teeth are much easier to get out.

644
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:41,715
Speaker 0: also kid teeth.

645
00:42:41,736 --> 00:42:42,640
Speaker 0: They're much easier to get out.

646
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,425
Speaker 1: Those weren't kids eat.

647
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:44,271
Speaker 1: they were permanent teeth.

648
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you were a kid.

649
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:50,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they removed those teeth and then the braces pulled all the teeth forward and then the wisdom teeth.

650
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:51,340
Speaker 0: It's like a room.

651
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:54,915
Speaker 0: Yes, I was 17 and they were like, yeah, you gotta get your wisdom teeth out.

652
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:59,010
Speaker 0: It's time and Basically, I was like how much will it hurt?

653
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,237
Speaker 0: They were like a lot.

654
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:02,548
Speaker 0: I was like, can you put me under?

655
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:05,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what else hurts not having your wisdom teeth out.

656
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,785
Speaker 1: Yep, that also hurts.

657
00:43:06,946 --> 00:43:07,809
Speaker 0: It's going to hurt.

658
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:18,786
Speaker 0: my stepdad had an extra tooth that grew Beyond a wisdom - yeah like a double wise - and it was past all his normal teeth and kind of growing out of the top Of his mouth straight down.

659
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:19,449
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

660
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,260
Speaker 0: Oh that kind of - yeah that kind of - yeah.

661
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:30,482
Speaker 0: But so I got general anesthesia to get all four wisdom teeth removed at once Because they do local it's usually wanted it one Yeah, so they were like look back We'll do the other.

662
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:34,824
Speaker 0: they were like look if we put you all the way under we can do everything now You won't feel a thing.

663
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:35,747
Speaker 0: you'll wake up at home.

664
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:37,413
Speaker 0: and I was like sign me up doc.

665
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:39,580
Speaker 0: and I remember so distinctly.

666
00:43:40,042 --> 00:43:49,355
Speaker 0: They put the mask over my face and they were like inhale deeply and count backwards from 10 And I inhale deeply and I said 10 and I remember thinking I wonder how long I can hold.

667
00:43:49,656 --> 00:43:51,666
Speaker 0: and I literally woke up at Home and it was all over.

668
00:43:52,411 --> 00:43:53,759
Speaker 0: I didn't even get through that sentence.

669
00:43:54,501 --> 00:44:05,380
Speaker 1: I've heard right that if you do the general thing that what they do is cuz like you're not conscious You can't keep your mouth open Right intentionally is they basically put a like a jack inside your mouth to jack your jaw open?

670
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:13,280
Speaker 1: I can believe that right and I've also heard that basically They'll jack it way the fuck open and then you'll be all sore when you wake up.

671
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:21,373
Speaker 1: I was real sore that when I was young and part of the soreness is not just the tooth pulling obviously But also that they jacked your mouth all the way fucking and they wrench your.

672
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,879
Speaker 0: you're around a lot in there.

673
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:29,347
Speaker 0: Right seen videos of like what it looks like when they're taking wisdom to you that guy just fucking like holding on to a tooth With pliers cuz you're asleep.

674
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,131
Speaker 1: He doesn't give a shit.

675
00:44:30,352 --> 00:44:31,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, he doesn't have to go easy or anything.

676
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:35,176
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'd want to try the Twilight anesthesia.

677
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:36,020
Speaker 1: What is that about?

678
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,237
Speaker 0: Uh, basically you're conscious and will respond but you won't remember anything.

679
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:44,431
Speaker 0: Yeah No, I worry that while you're under you feel all that pain.

680
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:45,254
Speaker 0: You just don't remember it.

681
00:44:45,635 --> 00:44:45,896
Speaker 1: Yeah.

682
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,140
Speaker 1: No, my grandma got it.

683
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,188
Speaker 0: I saw some video when she got to some eye surgery.

684
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,260
Speaker 0: She's a hundred percent conscious and the doctor keeps talking to her.

685
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,007
Speaker 0: He's like don't open don't close that.

686
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,412
Speaker 0: I blink that I do this.

687
00:44:55,473 --> 00:45:00,028
Speaker 0: do that and she's responding and talking to him And meanwhile, he's fucking just cutting her eye open with the scalp.

688
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:01,492
Speaker 1: Maybe that's like that crazy drug.

689
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,596
Speaker 1: They use in Colombia.

690
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,626
Speaker 0: Oh Oh the the zombie one.

691
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forget what that was called me too.

692
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:12,672
Speaker 0: I saw a vice documentary But I think it's because croco deal took over all the news about crazy drugs.

693
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,820
Speaker 0: Maybe it's pretty much the final crazy.

694
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:17,538
Speaker 0: Like nothing will be crazier than that.

695
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:26,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the only real dental procedure head besides teeth pulling is teeth filling which is not too bad I guess teeth sealing but that doesn't even you know.

696
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:28,277
Speaker 1: drill most of the time.

697
00:45:28,297 --> 00:45:33,879
Speaker 0: funnily enough after we decided to do this show I had a tooth related incident at work.

698
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:40,816
Speaker 0: a co-worker was like Guys, my daughter just broke one of her teeth like in half.

699
00:45:41,278 --> 00:45:44,789
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so we're like what and go to the dentist.

700
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,656
Speaker 0: He's like she ran into a door.

701
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:51,879
Speaker 0: So go to the dentist And she so he pulls out a picture and yeah, her tooth is like broken off like halfway down.

702
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,375
Speaker 0: Whoa, and you know cuz I had something like that happen once.

703
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:56,220
Speaker 0: but basically what it was?

704
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,040
Speaker 0: I was flossing and I had a tooth that had a filling from braces like braces fucked and this really just came out.

705
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,740
Speaker 0: So the braces fucked up the front of this tooth.

706
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,999
Speaker 0: So I had an amalgam filling like on the whole front of the tooth from a long time ago.

707
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,559
Speaker 0: Apparently a cavity grew behind it but didn't get into the nerve and didn't get around it.

708
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:18,323
Speaker 0: So unless I'd gotten an x-ray, which I just hadn't gotten for a few years There's no way to know.

709
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:29,699
Speaker 0: so one day I'm flossing and the whole front of my tooth just goes ping and bounces off of the Mirror and I'm like, oh, yeah Cuz you know when you break it - all you're thinking is I hope they can fix it.

710
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,368
Speaker 0: How can I get you a dentist like right?

711
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:33,814
Speaker 1: There's the one thing right?

712
00:46:33,854 --> 00:46:35,200
Speaker 1: It's like I'm not it's like you.

713
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,607
Speaker 1: I go to the dentist for some drilling.

714
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,300
Speaker 1: I'm like, whatever even if I they said you have to have a root canal.

715
00:46:39,482 --> 00:46:42,683
Speaker 1: Sorry, I'd be like, oh well And I just do it.

716
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:48,720
Speaker 1: the one thing that I am actually afraid to go to the dentist for is a dental implant.

717
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:52,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it's that's like you're a hockey player and you lose a tooth.

718
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:53,379
Speaker 1: What do you do?

719
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,854
Speaker 0: This is what they do general anesthesia and I wake up with a new robot - I don't care.

720
00:46:57,874 --> 00:47:06,391
Speaker 1: They take a screw a literal metal screw and they screw it into your jaw in this in the spot where the tooth was.

721
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:07,052
Speaker 0: that's cool.

722
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:12,143
Speaker 1: and then on the Right on.

723
00:47:12,183 --> 00:47:15,980
Speaker 1: that's awesome, I guess conceptually it's awesome.

724
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:26,000
Speaker 1: but if I think about someone screwing a metal screw into my general anesthesia, I Don't really want general anesthesia either because that is in itself also dangerous.

725
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:28,578
Speaker 1: But yeah, I really don't want to have that.

726
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:35,020
Speaker 1: But I guess the good part is if you have an implanted tooth like that and something ever happens to it They can just pop it off the screw and pop a new one.

727
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:36,224
Speaker 0: I think the cool thing is.

728
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:39,094
Speaker 1: the bad part is what if the screw just fucking shatters your jaw?

729
00:47:39,696 --> 00:47:40,278
Speaker 0: that can happen.

730
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,866
Speaker 1: you can Don't get a tooth implant.

731
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:49,660
Speaker 0: So I'm at least confident unless you have to Our generation is gonna be one of the first ones we're in our old age.

732
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:52,429
Speaker 0: Dental technology has actually progressed a lot in the last.

733
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:54,756
Speaker 1: all these rumors about stem cells.

734
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:55,900
Speaker 1: Your tooth just grows back.

735
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:57,331
Speaker 1: I'm like all about that.

736
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:58,117
Speaker 1: I cannot wait.

737
00:47:58,218 --> 00:48:01,580
Speaker 1: Yep I'm like, please just pop my filling out squirt some stem cells in there.

738
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,679
Speaker 1: My tooth grows back and I'll be like, oh, yes real teeth perfect shrank teeth.

739
00:48:06,313 --> 00:48:08,446
Speaker 0: Oh Like a tiny doll.

740
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:09,732
Speaker 1: I'd be the greatest.

741
00:48:09,912 --> 00:48:10,515
Speaker 0: guys get guys.

742
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:11,640
Speaker 0: Can you grow me a vampire tooth?

743
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,544
Speaker 0: I just got like a like one dog tooth like right there just and if like a tooth is chipped It's like up fixed it.

744
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:22,664
Speaker 1: Yeah with real tooth that actually grew from you your DNA your tooth not some fucking Cement or some of course.

745
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:28,120
Speaker 0: at the same time cybernetics and crazy material science could make a totally synthetic jaw or tooth or whatever.

746
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:29,327
Speaker 0: I think that's all coming.

747
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,051
Speaker 1: Mmm.

748
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:31,560

Speaker 0: the reality is as far as I can tell my mouth Perfectly.

751
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:39,191
Speaker 0: if you don't take care of your teeth, you're fucked.

752
00:48:39,553 --> 00:48:43,268
Speaker 0: But if you do take care of your teeth There's still a not zero chance.

Speaker 0: My grandpa actually like his teeth are really good for how old he is.

759
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:02,144

760
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,240

Speaker 0: I mean I've shared every tooth related.

773
00:49:38,721 --> 00:49:39,825
Speaker 0: I have one more tooth anecdote.

774
00:49:39,986 --> 00:49:43,480
Speaker 0: Okay, so when I was in middle school got to science Olympiad states.

775
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:45,983
Speaker 0: So we got to go to Lansing Someone.

776
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,009
Speaker 1: someone had a tooth problem.

777
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:47,915
Speaker 0: The bus broke down.

778
00:49:48,156 --> 00:49:49,945
Speaker 0: school bus buses.

779
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:57,429
Speaker 0: tooth broke due to Liability concerns even though we broke down less than a mile away from the hotel We were staying at.

780
00:49:57,692 --> 00:49:58,420
Speaker 1: you couldn't walk there.

781
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:06,919
Speaker 0: We had to stay on the bus until a bus came from our home To pick us up and drive us the rest of the way.

782
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,640
Speaker 0: So we said this fucking bus for like four hours.

783
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:14,120
Speaker 0: Then the bus got towed to a parking lot and we went into this other hotel.

784
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,340
Speaker 0: That was like a block away from our real hotel and I had to fucking sit there for another three or four hours.

785
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:19,983
Speaker 0: I would just run.

786
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:21,189
Speaker 1: I just run off the bus.

787
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:22,797
Speaker 0: I thought about it.

788
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:23,380
Speaker 0: I was in middle school.

789
00:50:23,802 --> 00:50:29,705
Speaker 0: so we're hanging around just bored out of our goddamn minds playing mafia and Someone won.

790
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,339
Speaker 0: so she jumped up and down.

791
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:37,727
Speaker 0: The metal that she was wearing Flipped up into the air.

792
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:39,778
Speaker 1: So you had already won the science.

793
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:40,704
Speaker 0: Yes We already won.

794
00:50:40,724 --> 00:50:43,360
Speaker 0: this is this all happened on the way to the hotel after the competition.

795
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,030
Speaker 0: Okay, jumps up in the air.

796
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,660
Speaker 1: The metal goes up into the air.

797
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,980
Speaker 0: It's her in the face levers around hits her in the face and just shatters one of her front teeth.

798
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:56,440
Speaker 0: Okay, completely into nerve exposed crippling pain.

799
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:58,877
Speaker 0: We had to wait till that fucking bus came.

800
00:51:00,281 --> 00:51:06,024
Speaker 0: So before they would let her parents take her to the dentist Just call 9-1-1.

801
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:07,268

809
00:51:35,457 --> 00:51:41,514
Speaker 1: if that didn't work I would have punched them in the teeth until I broke one of their teeth Such that they would then join me and fight with me.
