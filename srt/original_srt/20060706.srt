1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,465
Speaker 0: It's Thursday July 6th, and this is geek nights tonight oddly enough.

2
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:17,989
Speaker 0: We talk about dentistry orthodontics and teeth.

3
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:19,868
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:28,170
Speaker 0: You know for the first time in my life probably ever I I was given a day off from work that I wasn't sure I wanted.

5
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:30,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, that happens.

6
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:39,028
Speaker 0: it was because for those of you were paying attention I was here on Monday while everyone else was still at the beach and the boardwalk even though I didn't actually go to the boardwalk that day, but that's beside the point.

7
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:45,170
Speaker 0: and That was because my work made me come in on Monday But then I had Tuesday off to make up for the fact that that kind of sucked.

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,710
Speaker 0: I got Friday off now tomorrow, which is great, but I don't have anything in particular to do on a day off now.

9
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,570
Speaker 0: I took care of it all on the 4th of July.

10
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:58,010
Speaker 1: Why don't you do all that shit that oh you took care of it on the 4th of July?

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,650
Speaker 0: The only thing I could do is get a haircut, but I decided against getting a haircut.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,999
Speaker 0: I'm gonna see how long I can grow my hair.

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,865
Speaker 1: That's scary.

14
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,889
Speaker 0: Yeah It's reaching the bottom like it's gonna hit the small of my back within another month or two.

15
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:10,630
Speaker 1: I think you should go get a haircut.

16
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:22,657
Speaker 0: Well what I'm gonna Do is I'm gonna talk to some stylists and learn how to make it look good now that it's really really long Because now I'm just tying it back like I've done because I mean women Have a million ways you can deal with long hair.

17
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:23,560
Speaker 0: do all these cool things.

18
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:33,570
Speaker 0: as a guy in the Western world I have basically like two options I can tie it back or I can let it not be tied back.

19
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you tried to make any other sort of haircut with it.

20
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,266
Speaker 1: It would be a woman's haircut now.

21
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,294
Speaker 0: There are male Styles.

22
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:43,067
Speaker 1: I mean just pushing it over the front of your shoulders is womanly.

23
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:45,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, though I actually wear it like that fairly often.

24
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:55,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, and actually a lot of times if it's really if I'll wear it with like a tail like a ponytail But it's kind of hanging from the side And it's I don't get to post a picture of it or something.

25
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,421
Speaker 0: But I've seen styles that look good that aren't like that.

26
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:00,650
Speaker 0: I can't recreate them for the life of me.

27
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,757
Speaker 0: I have trouble dealing with my hair.

28
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:06,510
Speaker 1: I don't know why I think we're gonna have to go to someplace in the city.

29
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,294
Speaker 1: That's expensive.

30
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:08,038
Speaker 0: See that's what I'm gonna.

31
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,430
Speaker 0: Do I'm gonna go somewhere and be like all right?

32
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:13,270
Speaker 0: How do I deal with my hair and make it look awesome all the time?

33
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:16,539
Speaker 0: They'll say $300 please and I'll say sure cuz I got a lot of money.

34
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:17,502
Speaker 1: Okay.

35
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:21,838
Speaker 1: I've blown you what you'll spend $300 in a haircut But you won't buy a new freaking computer.

36
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,069
Speaker 0: I'd realize it's shopping.

37
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,547
Speaker 0: Remember how I said you can build a badass computer for less than 600 bucks.

38
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:30,802
Speaker 0: You can build a badass computer for less than 400 bucks now.

39
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:35,479
Speaker 0: Yeah a good God I'm gonna buy a computer real soon all right.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,068
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is every like.

41
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:40,860
Speaker 0: last week I made a computer on new egg, and it was badass.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,462
Speaker 0: It was like 480 bucks.

43
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:44,808
Speaker 0: this week I made the same computer.

44
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:45,851
Speaker 0: It was $440.

45
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:51,130
Speaker 0: hard drive got cheaper, so I'm gonna hold out until that levels off a little bit.

46
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,343
Speaker 1: It's gonna boost back up right cuz this new egg specials.

47
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:56,710
Speaker 1: That's why you gotta buy it now.

48
00:02:57,112 --> 00:03:00,690
Speaker 0: Well the thing is those things weren't new egg specials, but now I'm watching the new egg specials.

49
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:11,245
Speaker 1: And if the moment I remember I designed a computer And it came out wicked cheap because they were like four new egg special items And then as soon as those disappeared the computer like increased in price a whole bunch.

50
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:12,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

51
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:21,268
Speaker 0: anyway Also, I'd like to give a nod and this is the benefit of going four nights a week is that we can respond Immediately when anything happens in the world.

52
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:33,490
Speaker 0: Now way back we mentioned that we sent some feedback to anime world order and just now They responded they did their episode and they cut out the part where they talk about our feedback and made a separate link for it.

53
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,022
Speaker 1: Yeah, they seem to whenever they do something incredibly long in their episode.

54
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:44,727
Speaker 1: They cut it out and make a separate mp3 of it and That's what they did with their response to our audio feedback.

55
00:03:44,948 --> 00:03:58,330
Speaker 0: now one I like that and I think where I'm going to do that for like our how computers work series I'm gonna cut it out from the news and the things of the day and make it just a separate thing mmm, but anyway First off I love their feedback relinked to it.

56
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,080
Speaker 0: I suggest everyone listen to it because I was very happy with it.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,610
Speaker 1: It was incredibly entertaining and humorous.

58
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:16,869
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz I will say now in the interest of full disclosure that About 20% of the things we said in the feedback were very specifically crafted to elicit anger And we were curious how they would react and they reacted awesomely

59
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:18,235
Speaker 1: uh-huh,

60
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:25,568
Speaker 0: and also I have one tiny clarification because He was paraphrasing me in the email, which is great because I wrote a frickin long.

61
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:35,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one thing is that a lot of the things they said we had already rebutted in email But then they didn't always go to the email to get the rebuttal.

62
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:41,171
Speaker 1: I think we really need to arrange like a final showdown on Skype and do a cross podcast Thing.

63
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:56,070
Speaker 0: to finish this off now if we can't arrange that we're gonna have all of our equipment at Otacon and we'll do it And maybe depending on the panel we might be able to do some sort of live adversarial things.

64
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,056
Speaker 0: The panel is gonna be huge.

65
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,550
Speaker 0: All right, but that's all beside the poll.

66
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,319
Speaker 1: Hopefully it'll be huge.

67
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:05,083
Speaker 0: the one one part It could be just one guy showing up But we're so glad you guys responded in the way you did.

68
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,410
Speaker 0: you said a lot of interesting things.

69
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,219
Speaker 0: The guy Chris was his name who you had up there.

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,850
Speaker 0: He gets a million points for knowing what the hell big fire is.

71
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:19,430
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's still around but as of five years ago, it was still going strong at Ohio con.

72
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:22,834
Speaker 1: I don't even know if that was technically a big fire But I think it was.

73
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:30,030
Speaker 0: it called itself big fire and the dude who told us about big fire Told us about it at that con and then disappeared knowingly.

74
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:31,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see.

75
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:36,490
Speaker 0: if you know, who knows but I gotta say I want we're gonna talk more about this on the anime episode.

76
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,690
Speaker 0: But I had no idea that your cons in Florida don't have the after parties and I'm really sorry.

77
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:53,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like a lot of the things are as you said we like something and you don't like it or it sucks for you in Florida or You just suck.

78
00:05:56,118 --> 00:06:04,106
Speaker 1: So All the all the arguments that end in one of those three things I think we can eliminate but there are some leftovers that require further discussion.

79
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, but seriously That your descriptions.

80
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:08,927
Speaker 0: I've been to party is like the ones you described.

81
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:18,697
Speaker 0: and yeah Yeah, the the part the good parties You just got to meet the people and find the cool people who will run them and know before you say Oh, don't be shit talkers.

82
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:19,583
Speaker 0: We don't run them anymore.

83
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:20,449
Speaker 0: We don't have time for that.

84
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:31,230
Speaker 0: No, though if you guys want to do something at Otacon We could lend the full backing of the front row crew and we have run some pretty badass parties in our day.

85
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:38,570
Speaker 1: I think we should start doing something like making the podcast party at every anime con where there are no enough podcast.

86
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, we've got that third hotel room.

87
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,505
Speaker 1: We do we can.

88
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,250
Speaker 1: it's not big enough for a real party though.

89
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,015
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

90
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:48,150
Speaker 0: we could keep it for one night.

91
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:51,686
Speaker 1: Next you gotta get the Berkshire Suites if we want to do the party.

92
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:55,170
Speaker 0: Yeah No, maybe next year because now we have money we have to worry about it.

93
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,349
Speaker 0: We'll just get that giant penthouse suite and do something crazy.

94
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:02,690
Speaker 0: Yep, I think we will but I think we'll have some sort of minor on advertised party with all the podcasters.

95
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:04,235
Speaker 1: That would definitely be cool.

96
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,650
Speaker 0: Yep, because I mean what we disagree with you guys a lot, but you guys are still awesome.

97
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,055
Speaker 0: I can't stress that enough.

98
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:11,621
Speaker 0: Don't think that we're trying to?

99
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,170
Speaker 0: well, we are trying to piss you off, but that's a whole different issue.

100
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:17,861
Speaker 1: It's really fun for us to do that because we can't be pissed off.

101
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,592
Speaker 0: and yeah, yeah, it's kind of a hobby We're.

102
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:23,880
Speaker 0: sometimes we troll in the real real world just for fun.

103
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:24,382
Speaker 1: Yep.

104
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:24,763
Speaker 1: Yep.

105
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,028
Speaker 0: Yep and to make a point.

106
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:26,429
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

107
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,909
Speaker 0: But anyway, we'll talk about that more on Tuesday, Wednesday.

108
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait, I keep.

109
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:35,814
Speaker 0: I don't know why I say Tuesday when I mean Wednesday all the time and Tuesday We're talking about some sort of game.

110
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what game I don't know either.

111
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,010
Speaker 0: But anyway, we got some news.

112
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:42,138
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll do my news first.

113
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,810
Speaker 0: All right, we actually had a lot of news for one So we had to pare it down to two stories.

114
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:57,521
Speaker 1: yeah, so there's been a lot of talk over the years of Microsoft trying to kill the iPod with some other device or Kill the iTunes music store with some service or anything like that.

115
00:07:57,762 --> 00:07:57,862
Speaker 0: Now.

116
00:07:57,882 --> 00:08:07,930
Speaker 0: We've talked in the past greatly about Microsoft's ventures into making hardware devices and the tricks they use and how many of those devices never actually see the light of day.

117
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:18,987
Speaker 0: now Microsoft now finally has something that just might work somehow and Scott's news is the one of the big reasons why it might work.

118
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:24,969
Speaker 1: now What they're gonna do is if you use the Microsoft music store thing.

119
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:26,530
Speaker 1: Well, here's the problem.

120
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,470
Speaker 1: Is that if you use the iTunes music store?

121
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,770
Speaker 1: You can only play those songs with iTunes or with your iPod and nothing else.

122
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,496
Speaker 0: I mean as cool as Apple is.

123
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:48,850
Speaker 0: they very much use DRM to lock customers in Which is a tactic that geeks around the world to cry Microsoft for yeah It's like DRM is a is really meant to keep you from pirating music that you digital music that you paid for.

124
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:57,482
Speaker 1: But the Apple DRM also the reason that Apple goes along with it is because they use it to keep you using Apple products And nothing else.

125
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:06,269
Speaker 1: Microsoft has another DRM scheme I think it's called plays for sure and Apples is called fairplay and plays for sure.

126
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,080
Speaker 1: work is you know, if you make devices you can make a plays for sure device.

127
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,351
Speaker 1: you just give Microsoft some money.

128
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:18,620
Speaker 1: I think and You know, there are a lot of plays for sure players and plays for sure, you know softwares and all sorts of things.

129
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:22,400
Speaker 1: There's only one fair play player and that's the iPod.

130
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:41,083
Speaker 1: So it's really hard to compete when people are using, you know the iTunes music store to try to sell songs that are plays for sure and Yeah, so and it's also hard to sell players that aren't iPods because people who buy things in the iTunes music store pretty much Have to use an iPod.

131
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:55,438
Speaker 1: the next Microsoft music buying thing, whatever they want to call it What they're gonna do is when you install that it's gonna look at your iTunes and it's gonna see what songs you've bought and give You those songs for free.

132
00:09:56,155 --> 00:10:04,105
Speaker 0: Yes and it's really to the point where Microsoft is going to pay to have these songs licensed through their method and give them to pocket.

133
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,447
Speaker 1: basically Apple is.

134
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:18,212
Speaker 1: you're now going to be able to buy something on iTunes Then go to the other program get it for free because you just bought it an iTunes music store But and then put it on your plays for sure player instead of your iPod, but

135
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:26,232
Speaker 0: it doesn't violate any sort of terms of service or DRM or anything because they're not cracking Apple stuff.

136
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:29,220
Speaker 0: They're just giving you the same song from their system.

137
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:31,140
Speaker 0: Yep, it's in my eyes.

138
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:42,035
Speaker 0: I mean this is gonna sound strange But despite the fact that I'd really dislike Vista and a lot of things Microsoft does in the last year I have really gained a lot of respect as Microsoft is really.

139
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,581
Speaker 0: they're not stupid They don't.

140
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:51,700
Speaker 0: they realize that if they continued on their previous, I mean, they're putting open document in word now I think they realize if they continued on their previous track of evil evil evil.

141
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:55,695
Speaker 0: They really were gonna be destroyed and they're not stupid people.

142
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:56,880
Speaker 0: They know what they're doing.

143
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:00,615
Speaker 0: This is a brilliant brilliant idea that I never would have thought of.

144
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:10,960
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like, you know It's really hard to crack apples DRM, you know, we cracked it once but since then the only real way to crack it is to burn a CD and then rip the CD and that sort of thing.

145
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:26,592
Speaker 1: so, you know, finally we found a legitimate kind of way not to crack the DRM, but to you know get the songs that you paid for in some other format and This may or may not put a hurting to Apple.

146
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:34,799
Speaker 1: if people decide, you know How many people out there really don't want iPods but you know buy them because they use the iTunes music store.

147
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:45,320
Speaker 1: now Those people might be able to be set free if Microsoft can inform them and grab them Especially since non iPod mp3 players cost a fraction of what iPods cost.

148
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:56,240
Speaker 1: Well at the lower level yeah at the high space echelon where you know The iPods even if you just consider them as mp3 players they are high-level mp3 players.

149
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:05,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's ever the shuffle and the shuffle really, you know doesn't Compare with things like the little cube thing and the SanDisk players and the Samsung players Yeah,

150
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:13,773
Speaker 0: but I mean the at the load like the nano 2 gig is very high quality But you can get two and four gig players for like a hundred dollars less

151
00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:14,797
Speaker 1: more like $50 less

152
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:17,968
Speaker 0: Found some for $100 less.

153
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,800
Speaker 1: it's tough because some of those don't have all the same feet.

154
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,603
Speaker 0: Oh, no, they don't.

155
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:24,553
Speaker 0: one of them was actually an iPod nano bootleg.

156
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:27,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was straight up a bootleg I thought about buying.

157
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:30,388
Speaker 1: like some of them don't have the color screen Some of them don't do all the other things.

158
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:35,820
Speaker 1: the nano does like show pictures and you know There are other things that make the comparison a little wonky.

159
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,081
Speaker 0: But I'm not saying that there's no reason to get iPods because one I got an iPod and two iPods have a lot of slick Stuff.

160
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:54,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is that you know, of course no matter what players software combination You're using for podcasting iTunes iPod is the easiest Best way to do it with the least effort and the most slickness.

161
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,894
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean for all the trouble we've had with other Mac things iTunes just works.

162
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,398
Speaker 0: It just works real well.

163
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:14,379
Speaker 0: Yep Okay All right now my news actually is very related to this in that and this actually came up when I worked for the IT department at the Rochester Institute of Technology the the the group that you know supports the network and all that stuff.

164
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,277
Speaker 0: What happened is that?

165
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:44,720
Speaker 0: RIT was considering purchasing from you know some outside entity access to a commercial mp3 or mute music download software service for the students and providing it to them for free and a Lot of universities have been doing this in order to one stave off RIAA lawsuits And in fact in many cases, it's been shown that the RIAA was behind closed doors Subsidizing and funding these things to try to get kids hooked.

166
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:53,565
Speaker 0: The idea is that if you give kids like the new Napster or all those things for free while they're in college One maybe they won't pirate things.

167
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:59,080
Speaker 0: That's removing liability from the school and two maybe when they leave they'll keep paying for these things.

168
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:05,458
Speaker 0: The news that has come out as these things have been implemented is that almost no one uses them now.

169
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:09,760
Speaker 1: Gee, I wonder why BitTorrent now?

170
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:16,940
Speaker 0: I find this interesting in that it proves a very valid and important point when it comes to buying online music.

171
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:24,380
Speaker 0: the only exception is So far iTunes and even the iTunes music store wall.

172
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:28,848
Speaker 0: I mean it's doing very well but it's not even putting a dent in illegal downloading.

173
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:33,039
Speaker 0: consider this the student now has a choice between free and free.

174
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:43,580
Speaker 0: the competition is between two free things one of which is Illegal and could put you in jail or jail but could cost you a lot of money.

175
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:46,559
Speaker 0: It could put you in jail depending on how you go about it.

176
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:53,654
Speaker 1: Yeah But it's most likely just going to cost you a lot of money if you get caught which is like a one in something chance According to that insurance company.

177
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:58,411
Speaker 0: Yeah But and the other system is a system that normally people pay for.

178
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:04,670
Speaker 0: now you'd think the system people pay for would work better But these systems with their DRM.

179
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:14,520
Speaker 0: it's at the point where even if these systems are free It's still more convenient and better to use the illegal bootleg pirate shady way and take the risk.

180
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:18,239
Speaker 0: So in that case what who do these companies expect to pay them?

181
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,429
Speaker 0: I mean iTunes is doing very well But all these other services are just crap.

182
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:32,136
Speaker 0: and yet the RIAA is bullying colleges Into paying for these services for their students even though the students don't want them in order to stave off lawsuits.

183
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:32,880
Speaker 0: and it's really it's.

184
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:39,087
Speaker 1: they're going around to colleges and Threatening them and then taking money from them.

185
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:42,035
Speaker 0: It's you know black a shame if something happened to your school here.

186
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:43,660
Speaker 1: Eh, it's almost blackmail.

187
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:49,644
Speaker 1: it's like they go to a school and they say give us money or else and the school gives them money and Then they get.

188
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:50,286
Speaker 1: they say here.

189
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,898
Speaker 1: Here's what you got for your money and then no one there uses it.

190
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:59,412
Speaker 1: now It's like if I come to your house with a vacuum cleaner and I say hey Did you steal any vacuum cleaners lately?

191
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:01,160
Speaker 1: I might report you to the police here.

192
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:08,599
Speaker 1: I'm gonna sell you this crap-ass shit vacuum cleaner that you'll never use and you're gonna take it or else I'm gonna call the cops on you.

193
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:13,700
Speaker 1: So the guy goes fine gives me ten bucks takes the shit-ass vacuum cleaner throws it out.

194
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:18,440
Speaker 1: And you know, you can't go to someone's house threaten them for money or force them to buy something from you.

195
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,025
Speaker 0: Well, you can.

196
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:22,463
Speaker 0: it's called racketeering and it's a. it's a very Profitable business.

197
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,028
Speaker 1: It's a very legal business.

198
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,738
Speaker 1: They're using illegal business to stop illegal business.

199
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:27,360
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

200
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:32,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, now because it's not even stopping illegal business it's just illegal business.

201
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:42,979
Speaker 0: the really telling thing that and this is just a complete aside and I got to be kind of vague because The the thing I'm about to talk about was in fact a closed-door discussion that I was involved in at RIT.

202
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:49,800
Speaker 0: At RIT that they have issues with you know, social problems, but when it comes to technology, they know what they're doing.

203
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,407
Speaker 1: Everyone at the school knows that they're doing.

204
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:59,092
Speaker 0: if you walked into the quarter mile and yelled I need help with Ubuntu 100 people would walk over there.

205
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:07,106
Speaker 0: a hundred people there maybe ten guys Yeah, and half of them would say now you should use Debbie in and now you should use Susie now And then they'd start an argument about kernels.

206
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now when it comes technology, they're smart.

207
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:12,740
Speaker 0: They're the premier IT school.

208
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,273
Speaker 0: They were the first college to have an information technology program.

209
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,940
Speaker 0: They were the first ones to get it accredited.

210
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,734
Speaker 0: They basically wrote the accreditation process for information technology.

211
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,020
Speaker 1: at least they say they did.

212
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's a lot of merit to that.

213
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:29,660
Speaker 0: and when regards to computer science, they're very well recognized that they know what they're doing.

214
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:47,948
Speaker 0: So when the RIA approached RIT about all this and they were considering buying one of these services we had a closed-doors meeting of the staff of the IT group and the higher-ups of the IT group and Someone from the from the great high up beyond pre told this to us No, here's what we're thinking of doing.

215
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:48,953
Speaker 0: What do you think?

216
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,320
Speaker 0: and then at the end they asked?

217
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,740
Speaker 0: All right, nothing we say leaves this room, which I I'm not gonna give name names or anything.

218
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,628
Speaker 0: what are your honest opinions?

219
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:06,275
Speaker 0: because we know you all download and Unanimously all of these technology professionals said this is a stupid idea.

220
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,560
Speaker 0: This is racketeering.

221
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,026
Speaker 0: no one will go for it.

222
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,738
Speaker 0: the students will probably pirate more just to spite you.

223
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:23,298
Speaker 0: and RIT listen to all of us and as far as I know still hasn't bowed down to the pressure Despite the fact that RIT has been implicated numerous times in massive massive international piracy rings.

224
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:25,284
Speaker 0: Yep I mean the FBI came.

225
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,900
Speaker 1: there were kids who got like busted like you had customs officers coming and taking them away.

226
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,100
Speaker 0: That was a drink or die.

227
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:32,797
Speaker 1: I believe it might have been drink or die.

228
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:34,344
Speaker 0: was an International where's ring.

229
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:39,800
Speaker 0: that was shut the fuck down and the FBI and customs agents came and arrested kids.

230
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:41,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was crazy.

231
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:49,781
Speaker 0: That is the thing of the day.

232
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,775
Speaker 1: that is the thing of the day All right.

233
00:18:53,781 --> 00:19:02,581
Speaker 0: I found this kind of randomly All right, I guess there's an aside.

234
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:15,230
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen the movie snatch Yeah one fuck you to go see it immediately like the answer to the question that is this stone.

235
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,537
Speaker 0: Anyway, I found this kind of randomly.

236
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,870
Speaker 0: I didn't see anything better and I thought it was cute and cool.

237
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:24,908
Speaker 0: So it's my thing of the day.

238
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:26,175
Speaker 0: For some reason.

239
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:29,290
Speaker 0: there's this crow and he's standing around in the grass protein robot.

240
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:33,419
Speaker 0: No, no There's black crow like raven kind of thing a black bird sitting there.

241
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:40,310
Speaker 0: and then there's this bunny rabbit and he's just sitting there And this rabbit doesn't seem to like this crow.

242
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,426
Speaker 0: So he rushes it and he attacks it.

243
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:56,570
Speaker 0: the crow goes Shit and backs like flies away and then lands right back down and then the rabbit attacks it again and the crow flies up and flies back down and it's just this Rabbit chasing after this crow and this crow running away, but he won't fully run away.

244
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,477
Speaker 0: I don't know if there was something around the crow Why might have been something they both wanted to eat.

245
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:06,036
Speaker 1: but then they're not animals that eat each other or can really fight now And they're not animals that eat the same things.

246
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:07,882
Speaker 0: No, what do you think?

247
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,386
Speaker 0: rabbits eat vegetables?

248
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:10,590
Speaker 0: What do you think crows eat?

249
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:16,966
Speaker 1: They might eat a vegetable they usually harass like, you know gardens or corn and shit.

250
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,210
Speaker 0: crows don't eat grass.

251
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:19,670
Speaker 1: No, they don't eat grass.

252
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:27,370
Speaker 1: But you know remember on Winnie the Pooh The rabbit guy would always have the crows in his garden eating his vegetables because the rabbit has a garden.

253
00:20:27,752 --> 00:20:29,829
Speaker 1: There you go rabbit versus a crow.

254
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:31,529
Speaker 1: The thing is Winnie the Pooh.

255
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:35,857
Speaker 0: it's like this clean grass field and This rabbit and this crow are just kind of fighting.

256
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,470
Speaker 0: and then finally this other crow comes and the rabbits like oh crap and he runs.

257
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:46,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just a weird video and you know make it really makes you think about different combinations of animals Like you never see together.

258
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:50,203
Speaker 1: Like have you ever seen like a monkey encounter a midget shark?

259
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:55,970
Speaker 0: I Really want to see a monkey encounter a shark Yeah.

260
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,674
Speaker 1: Or like a monkey versus an octopus or a snake Versus a.

261
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:05,689
Speaker 0: what you take a monkey you give him a knife you throw him in a cage with like a lion and a midget.

262
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,749
Speaker 1: Or like a snake versus an eagle or something like that.

263
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,741
Speaker 0: We saw a scorpion versus a much larger scorpion than Jarhead.

264
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:13,623
Speaker 1: We did.

265
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:15,970
Speaker 0: I don't know why that guy bet on the really tiny scorpion.

266
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,451
Speaker 1: I don't know.

267
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:17,093
Speaker 1: I think it's cuz.

268
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:18,136
Speaker 1: it was his scorpion.

269
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:19,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he was.

270
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:19,881
Speaker 1: he was really dumb.

271
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:20,823
Speaker 0: He was crying.

272
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:25,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Wish there were more scorpion fights in that movie.

273
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:26,104
Speaker 0: You know what?

274
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:27,470
Speaker 1: you're in the shower with the cricket.

275
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:29,622
Speaker 0: I was about to say the cricket fights in the shower.

276
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:30,025
Speaker 0: Yep.

277
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:30,910
Speaker 0: That's another movie.

278
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,490
Speaker 0: Everyone should see the show.

279
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:43,947
Speaker 0: In fact, there's a bunch of people who have asked to be added to my friends list on Netflix And I haven't added you because I'm lazy and I forgot I'll get to it as soon as I do and then immediately add the shower to your list and then watch it.

280
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:48,724
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, Scott has also got an animal related thing of the day.

281
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:49,829
Speaker 1: Well, you see there's this.

282
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:52,440
Speaker 1: It's a video from the bottom of the sea.

283
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,008
Speaker 1: There's a hole in the bottom of the sea.

284
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:57,499
Speaker 0: It lives in a pineapple under the sea.

285
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,603
Speaker 1: No, that one's no good.

286
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:00,490
Speaker 0: I hate spongebob so much anyway.

287
00:22:00,873 --> 00:22:09,450
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's um, so at the bottom of the sea This is like this spongy coral mass and you're looking at it and then all of a sudden it's an octopus.

288
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,960
Speaker 1: Ooh It's all chameleon, but not just like a chameleon that's.

289
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,187
Speaker 1: you know, you've seen chameleons before.

290
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:23,010
Speaker 1: they're pretty good at Matching their surroundings by changing the colors and patterns on their skin, but they're not perfect.

291
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,659
Speaker 1: I mean, they're just kind of they get close.

292
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:28,690
Speaker 1: this octopus is like goddamn.

293
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,590
Speaker 1: They need to get some like military equivalents.

294
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:38,770
Speaker 1: It's like the freaking predator to this octopus the predator like seriously ghost in the shell action with the Invisibleness.

295
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:40,828
Speaker 1: You just got to see this.

296
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:53,610
Speaker 1: It's cool because in the video they show you the octopus appearing and then they show it in reverse so you can see the octopus Disappearing in slow motion backwards and it's way cool and I kind of want to be the octopus.

297
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:55,658
Speaker 0: That wouldn't be too bad a life.

298
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,330
Speaker 1: now you sit around the bottom of the sea got eight legs.

299
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:00,640
Speaker 1: You can camouflage with anything.

300
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,945
Speaker 0: I got a girl.

301
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,050
Speaker 0: There's got eight arms.

302
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone remember that?

303
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:06,499
Speaker 0: anyone out there?

304
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:09,510
Speaker 1: I think I know I'm getting an octopus of love.

305
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:10,959
Speaker 0: I don't know what the band was called.

306
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:12,469
Speaker 1: Oh God for this thing.

307
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:17,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, that me multimedia pack that came with like every multimedia computer back when 2x CD-roms appeared.

308
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:20,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was a music video of this band.

309
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:23,030
Speaker 0: and they have this music video to a song called octopus of love.

310
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:29,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was just reminded of it which brought back a flurry of dark times and pre-internet.

311
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:33,153
Speaker 1: I'm reminded of all my OS to multimedia.

312
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:40,539
Speaker 1: miss things I had on my 486 and the the icon that said information superhighway that never worked because they didn't plug in my modem.

313
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:48,683
Speaker 0: remember the days when if you like you saw an animated thing or a Video like you sit there just amazed like holy shit.

314
00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:49,566
Speaker 0: You'd show people.

315
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:49,907
Speaker 0: check it out.

316
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:50,709
Speaker 0: My computer made a beep.

317
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:51,943
Speaker 0: Wasn't that awesome?

318
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:56,257
Speaker 0: remember Microsoft Encarta, oh my god.

319
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the one I remember.

320
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,550
Speaker 1: you could watch a piece of Star Wars with it.

321
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, tiniest as little piece.

322
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:07,029
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway in real low resolution in a little tiny box.

323
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:14,110
Speaker 0: So our topic today if you listen to the beginning of the show, it's quite obvious is dentistry and teeth.

324
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:18,302
Speaker 0: Now you might wonder why we would talk about something like that.

325
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:20,128
Speaker 1: Well, it's for quite simple.

326
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:25,918
Speaker 1: you see it's I got back late And we couldn't think of something to talk about.

327
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:32,844
Speaker 1: and the reason I got back late is because today I went to the dentist Which is my uncle the dentist and then I went home and then I came here.

328
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:42,350
Speaker 0: now independently of that I got a call today Reminding me that I had a dentist appointment on Saturday, which I'd forgotten about because scheduled it like five months ago.

329
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:45,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we will talk about dentisting.

330
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,150
Speaker 0: I had to cancel that appointment because obviously we're going to Connecticut.

331
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:51,683
Speaker 0: Yep, so, all right, I want to start with childhood.

332
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,350
Speaker 0: you want to start with our current dentisting.

333
00:24:54,592 --> 00:24:57,703
Speaker 1: Maybe we should talk about some general dentisting like brush your fucking teeth.

334
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:58,125
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

335
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:58,506
Speaker 0: All right.

336
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:04,890
Speaker 0: All right real briefly Yeah, brush your teeth Bloss if you have bad breath, there's something wrong.

337
00:25:05,152 --> 00:25:08,172
Speaker 1: If you ever read breath brush your tongue You're.

338
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:14,930
Speaker 1: the bad breath is caused by bacteria that builds up in your mouth and release nasty smells after eating the food in your mouth.

339
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:23,265
Speaker 1: So you need to get rid of all of them which means brushing your tongue to get rid of all as more bacterias There's a it bacteria get on your tongue.

340
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,049
Speaker 1: They just go.

341
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:29,977
Speaker 0: Yep, also Surprisingly flossing your back two teeth.

342
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:34,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like a huge bastion of nasty floss everything.

343
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:41,889
Speaker 0: I mentioned this mostly because there's a guy at my work who awesome guy But good God will his breath kill a fly at a hundred yards.

344
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:52,897
Speaker 1: And if your breath is still bad after brushing twice a day and Brushing your tongue and flossing once a day but floss before you brush by the way You floss and then immediately brush.

345
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,909
Speaker 0: actually I brush lost and then I do a real quick brush.

346
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:00,490
Speaker 1: The dentist actually told me today to floss and then immediately brush.

347
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,154
Speaker 1: Yeah That's what the dentist says.

348
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:06,228
Speaker 0: so because otherwise your your floss all the gunk out and then you leave it in your mouth.

349
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,364
Speaker 1: exactly You need to brush it away.

350
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:16,236
Speaker 1: Um Yeah, if that still doesn't eliminate bad breath get yourself some Mouthwash, no, no the greatest.

351
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:23,105
Speaker 0: get yourself to a dentist or a periodontist and tell Evan look at you Cuz there's something wrong there might be something wrong or you just might need some mints.

352
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,089
Speaker 1: cuz you're you know.

353
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:28,944
Speaker 0: Well, I can say that I do know that mouthwash is mostly BS.

354
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:29,847
Speaker 1: It is mostly.

355
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,973
Speaker 0: it is it is Hit.

356
00:26:32,354 --> 00:26:36,830
Speaker 1: yeah mouthwash doesn't do a lot of the things it says it does but it will make your breath nice.

357
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:42,710
Speaker 0: To me whenever someone uses mouthwash for a long time their mouth just smells like mouthwash.

358
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,553
Speaker 0: So I know huh?

359
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,180
Speaker 0: They must have had a problem.

360
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,295
Speaker 1: Remember those are doing something about.

361
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:52,470
Speaker 0: remember at Ohio con when what's-her-name gave us those mouthwash strips.

362
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:54,458
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, those things.

363
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:57,590
Speaker 0: but that was like putting a Clorox wipe on my tongue.

364
00:26:58,012 --> 00:27:01,050
Speaker 0: They're real strong and painful and it served no purpose.

365
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:02,620
Speaker 0: My mouth tasted like Clorox.

366
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,374
Speaker 1: for like the next day go with an Altoid That works.

367
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:06,397
Speaker 1: Altoids work.

368
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,244
Speaker 1: double mint gum freakin works.

369
00:27:08,364 --> 00:27:09,910
Speaker 1: gum actually works real well.

370
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact gum has a lot of beneficial properties.

371
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:13,210
Speaker 0: if you chew it.

372
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,762
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean saliva does a lot to clean your teeth a lot.

373
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:22,049
Speaker 0: also the action of the gum and actually if you have Minor amounts of heartburn or indigestion chewing gum.

374
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:24,116
Speaker 0: Well mostly indigestion more so than heartburn.

375
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:29,340
Speaker 0: chewing gum can help because it stimulates the production of saliva and it stimulates the production of acid In the stomach.

376
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:33,982
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm So you can because your body thinks you're chewing when you're really not.

377
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:36,490
Speaker 1: it's kind of the same reason that diet soda is bad.

378
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:44,112
Speaker 1: Because you drink diet soda your body thinks the calories are coming in and they're not and then you get hungry and you actually end up Eating more.

379
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:54,330
Speaker 1: Yep, but yeah chewing gum is great as long as it's not, you know Sugary candy gum which will not do anything good now unless you chew it until it loses all flavor.

380
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:57,201
Speaker 0: Yep, Scott and I use very different toothpastes.

381
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,690
Speaker 1: I use aqua fresh because it tastes good.

382
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:03,564
Speaker 0: I use any baking soda and peroxide toothpaste.

383
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:05,110
Speaker 0: I don't care what brand because it tastes good.

384
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:12,825
Speaker 1: yep, I actually asked the dentist today because Basically, I'm sitting there and they're like we recommend Colgate total and I'm like what.

385
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:14,350
Speaker 1: how much do they pay you to say that?

386
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're like.

387
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,378
Speaker 1: actually they didn't pay him to say that.

388
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:23,297
Speaker 1: the deal is is that the regular toothpaste pretty much is as good As any other regular toothpaste.

389
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,946
Speaker 0: don't use that whitening toothpaste.

390
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:25,650
Speaker 1: That's yeah.

391
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,335
Speaker 1: Most of that is just BS Toothpaste is toothpaste.

392
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:29,776
Speaker 1: it sir.

393
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,100
Speaker 1: It really doesn't do much.

394
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,336
Speaker 1: most of the brushing and cleaning is the brushing itself though The toothpaste just makes it taste good.

395
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:40,630
Speaker 0: Yep, though it also like if you have bad breath things like peroxide will kill bacteria.

396
00:28:40,911 --> 00:28:41,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, they will.

397
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:46,670
Speaker 1: but actually the baking soda and peroxide is you know, it's okay.

398
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,547
Speaker 1: But then you know it fizzes and it's kind of nasty.

399
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:50,130
Speaker 0: and I like it.

400
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,016
Speaker 0: I really like the taste whatever Apparently the Colgate total.

401
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:58,350
Speaker 1: now the reason they recommend it is because it has some bacteria killing action.

402
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,730
Speaker 1: That's you know as good as if not better than the baking soda peroxide not the baking soda peroxide.

403
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:06,975
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll switch it up.

404
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:08,842
Speaker 1: I got I got a little free sample.

405
00:29:08,922 --> 00:29:10,006
Speaker 1: So we'll test it out.

406
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:10,608
Speaker 0: I'll try some.

407
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,690
Speaker 1: yeah I mean, I'm not gonna run out and buy a toothpaste because it was dentist recommended.

408
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:16,850
Speaker 1: In fact, I think I have a whole tube of acafresh.

409
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:19,685
Speaker 1: There's no way I'm buying new toothpaste until that's done.

410
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:27,657
Speaker 1: but You know if the Colgate total doesn't taste horrendous and I notice Cleanlier teeth.

411
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:33,703
Speaker 0: I mean, you know while I switch it up I've used baking soda and peroxide toothpaste for the last decade.

412
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:35,790
Speaker 0: So if so what I like it.

413
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:41,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if there are any things living in my mouth that have developed immunity to it.

414
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:43,450
Speaker 0: this total whatever is gonna fuck him up.

415
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,579
Speaker 1: I'll gotta go read the little package.

416
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,805
Speaker 1: I got it in the other room.

417
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:47,850
Speaker 1: All right, we'll see.

418
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:53,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, and oh as for floss, I personally recommend the oral B satin floss.

419
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:57,499
Speaker 1: It's more expensive But I'm not we weren't paid to say this.

420
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,885
Speaker 1: This is really my favorite floss.

421
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:00,813
Speaker 1: This isn't some joke He's not kidding.

422
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:02,238
Speaker 0: He got mad at me when I use some of it.

423
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:03,523
Speaker 1: once did I?

424
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:05,390
Speaker 0: you were like you used my floss.

425
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,943
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, and you said pay me and I gave you a penny.

426
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:11,819
Speaker 1: I Remember that but okay, I was in colony.

427
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,321
Speaker 1: Yeah.

428
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,388
Speaker 1: Anyway my that might have been me rapport.

429
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:16,375
Speaker 0: So yeah Yeah, cuz I ran out of floss.

430
00:30:16,737 --> 00:30:24,744
Speaker 1: It's it's a slightly more expensive floss than you know normal floss But it slides on the teeth nicely, you know, it won't.

431
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:26,690
Speaker 1: it's not that unwaxed floss.

432
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,347
Speaker 1: Just uh so hard to get it between the teeth and it hurts and I'm indifferent.

433
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:33,039
Speaker 0: I use whatever floss I got now and also the satin floss.

434
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:42,369
Speaker 1: it, you know, not only does it feel really good But it's all minty and fresh and and it it's really sturdy and it can really scrape the teeth.

435
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:46,190
Speaker 0: really nice Yeah, I got to say one time because I got it's gone now.

436
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,009
Speaker 0: But I had a filling and the filling had a tiny sharp edge that eventually wore down.

437
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:56,230
Speaker 0: But at one point I was flossing back there and the floss was cut by this and broke.

438
00:30:56,691 --> 00:31:00,523
Speaker 0: So now I had a piece of floss stuck between two teeth.

439
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:02,750
Speaker 0: There was almost no way to get it out.

440
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:03,661
Speaker 0: What was I gonna do?

441
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,228
Speaker 0: floss?

442
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,050
Speaker 0: I would have just that that did just push it in further.

443
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:14,187
Speaker 0: I just waited and eventually My body must have not liked it there and it slowly worked its way out.

444
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,896
Speaker 0: and like three days later I saw it and I grabbed it and ripped it out.

445
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:18,100
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

446
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:22,303
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm just like I got teeth pains right now Thinking about unwaxed floss.

447
00:31:22,728 --> 00:31:24,514
Speaker 1: Nah All right.

448
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:29,830
Speaker 0: All right now in terms of tooth health my teeth like my teeth are very good.

449
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:30,390
Speaker 0: They're very strong.

450
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:35,170
Speaker 0: My dentist always says that you know, everything's great, but I do have a lot of fillings mostly from my younger days.

451
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,955
Speaker 1: I have two fillings.

452
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:50,437
Speaker 1: My first one I got when I was 21 and the other one I think I got in 2003 or 4. so that was like a couple years ago and I had and I just went to the dentist today and X-rays, I'm fine.

453
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:51,463
Speaker 1: I didn't get any more cavities.

454
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:51,804
Speaker 0: Now.

455
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:52,769
Speaker 0: What kind of fillings are they?

456
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,830
Speaker 1: Actually the way the kind of fillings these are they're not gold sadly.

457
00:31:57,392 --> 00:32:01,130
Speaker 1: What they are is they first they drill a hole they drill out the cab.

458
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:07,412
Speaker 0: Because I read a Wikipedia a few days ago because I was I just happen to be bored and I know all about all the different Kinds.

459
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:07,794
Speaker 1: Yep.

460
00:32:07,814 --> 00:32:09,805
Speaker 1: They put in this sort of goop.

461
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:18,470
Speaker 1: It's like a clay Ceramic sort of all right, so you got like the composite like the natural looking one and then they take this gun.

462
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,588
Speaker 1: It's not really a gun, but it's like this bright heat light thing the UV thing.

463
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:26,641
Speaker 1: Yeah Jamming in there and it cooks it and turns it.

464
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:29,184
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a little mini kiln You know.

465
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:36,229
Speaker 1: They put clay in there and then they point this thing at it for a while and it cooks it and turns it into something That's as hard as tooth if not harder.

466
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:36,910
Speaker 1: Yep

467
00:32:37,052 --> 00:32:53,276
Speaker 0: now actually the one thing I've I've a lot of people talk about and I mentioned the type of filling only because I want to get a dig in here There are people out there who have got this bug up their butt about amalgam fillings now for the long long time and to this They're still used by far.

468
00:32:53,637 --> 00:33:11,930
Speaker 0: the one of the best most versatile ways to fill a cavity is with amalgam which is a mercury compound and crazy people think that this is dangerous somehow even though for 40 years if not longer there have been countless studies showing that this is completely untrue and it's a fabrication.

469
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:12,512
Speaker 1: This is always.

470
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:16,610
Speaker 1: the problem is sometimes people don't have common sense and it's like God what's wrong with you?

471
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:25,860
Speaker 1: And sometimes people do have common sense, but the truth is contrary to the common sense because it sometimes is Yep, and then you're like God what's wrong with you?

472
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,153
Speaker 0: Yep going with the common sense dental amalgam is perfectly safe You could have.

473
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:39,206
Speaker 0: you could swallow like a handful of those fillings and they would have almost no ill effects except for an upset stomach Yeah, as you would get if you swallowed any handful of metal.

474
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:47,150
Speaker 0: Yeah Cut up esophagus now actually because I had good insurance and for all the cavities I got which I can talk about why I got him later.

475
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:50,844
Speaker 0: But I had the choice between getting composite and amalgam for all the ones in the back.

476
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:52,652
Speaker 0: for the like two I have in The front.

477
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,390
Speaker 0: they gave me composite because I think else would look really ugly.

478
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,509
Speaker 0: You know my if one of my front teeth was just this gray thing.

479
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,441
Speaker 0: Amalgam lasts longer and it's more and it's more durable.

480
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:04,464
Speaker 0: It's also a lot cheaper.

481
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:06,350
Speaker 0: I forget the exact numbers.

482
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:15,168
Speaker 0: I saw a study that showed that amalgam fillings last an average of 15 to 20 years before they start to like need to be replaced and Composite last five to ten years.

483
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:23,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the dentist did a good job of you know Pressing on all my molars to check if all like the fillings and the sealants were all intact.

484
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:29,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I got some really old fillings like from shortly after my baby teeth fell out my new teeth.

485
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,330
Speaker 1: But replacing a filling isn't so bad as getting a new filling.

486
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:33,840
Speaker 1: Yes, you don't need really need the drilling.

487
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:37,870
Speaker 1: the filling just kind of falls out And actually they just put the goop more goop in there and cook it again.

488
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,155
Speaker 0: I thought this really interesting.

489
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:44,556
Speaker 0: the another different the composite fillings require less of the tooth to be drilled out To make an amalgam.

490
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:47,610
Speaker 0: they drill a bigger hole and they stick it in and it lasts a lot longer.

491
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:51,428
Speaker 0: But the composite while it falls out in five or ten years.

492
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:54,746
Speaker 0: possibly Do you only need to make a slightly larger hole to put a new one in?

493
00:34:55,069 --> 00:34:58,042
Speaker 0: Yep I still prefer amalgam just because they're really durable.

494
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,090
Speaker 0: I want to go to the dentist as little as possible.

495
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:05,410
Speaker 1: I also want to go to the dentist as little as possible, but as little as possible is once a year to get a cleaning.

496
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,816
Speaker 0: Yeah, I go every six months.

497
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:08,362
Speaker 1: I would go every six months.

498
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,410
Speaker 1: I don't think my insurance pays for twice a year.

499
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:16,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine does and I do it only because I have a history of difficulty with teeth due to a number of reasons.

500
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:20,670
Speaker 1: I have a history of not difficulty with teeth because I don't drink soda.

501
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:24,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't drink so much soda either and soda really wasn't the cause of my troubles.

502
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:26,379
Speaker 1: I didn't think it's cause of your troubles.

503
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,987
Speaker 1: the cause of many trouble it is.

504
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:33,730
Speaker 0: I'm not disagreeing But for an eight or nine years when I was young I had braces.

505
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,075
Speaker 1: I also had braces.

506
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:38,870
Speaker 0: I had braces for almost twice as long as any kid has braces.

507
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:40,610
Speaker 1: I had him for a long time.

508
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:43,008
Speaker 0: I had him You know for three years or so.

509
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,070
Speaker 0: Then they took him out and then it came to light that that orthodontist sucked ass and they didn't really work.

510
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:55,710
Speaker 0: I got new braces for another like four or five years and I got those out while I was a freshman in high school.

511
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:57,016
Speaker 1: Well, it's a little late.

512
00:35:57,498 --> 00:35:58,905
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, because it was a new set of braces.

513
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:08,750
Speaker 0: They had to start over and It sucked to have braces that long and as a result a lot of my teeth got a little bit discolored Which actually works out because from a distance they look a lot whiter.

514
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:17,789
Speaker 0: Then they normally would my teeth look really really bright and white but that's because they have these calcium deposits in the enamel Because of the cement from having braces for so long.

515
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:27,756
Speaker 0: and in addition to that I got a bunch of cavities early on when I was young and then I went to a different dentist finally and the dentist said Your molars are really deep.

516
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:28,941
Speaker 0: They've got these deep.

517
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:31,370
Speaker 0: They're not can't look their cavities, but they're not cavities.

518
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,204
Speaker 0: They just they had really deep crevices.

519
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:33,950
Speaker 0: It's a genetic thing.

520
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,716
Speaker 0: I think like 20% of the population has this.

521
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:43,530
Speaker 0: where this is the inside top part of your molars are really really deep and It's impossible to clean that and if you have that you'll get a crazy ton of cavities.

522
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:48,030
Speaker 0: So what he did is he filled them all in and then I didn't get another cavity for like 10 years.

523
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:49,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are called sealants.

524
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,450
Speaker 1: What they'll do is that they see a tooth that like a molar that's real deep that might get a cavity.

525
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:58,306
Speaker 1: What they do is they clean it out, you know, the dentist can clean it out you can't.

526
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,905
Speaker 1: and Then they just fill the.

527
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:07,390
Speaker 1: you know The giant pit in the molar with a bunch of stuff that's similar to the stuff that they fill the other teeth with But it's a little different.

528
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:19,710
Speaker 1: It's a chemical thing like they mix two things together and they you know they stir it up and it reacts with each other and sort of like a Glue thing kind of and it just makes your molar less deep by filling it up with stuff.

529
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,924
Speaker 1: It's called a filling not a filling a sealant.

530
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:22,185
Speaker 1: Yep.

531
00:37:22,286 --> 00:37:22,890
Speaker 0: It's a great thing.

532
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:25,750
Speaker 0: It's my cavity stopped and I didn't get any for a long time.

533
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:32,706
Speaker 0: It's really hard to get cavities in the molars after you seal them Yep, unless you get one in the side which usually comes from not flossing.

534
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:36,323
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, my braces situation.

535
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:47,590
Speaker 1: when I was a little kid They I went to one guy who gave me braces on the front teeth, you know Cuz I had him out sticking, you know the big giant overbite Yep, and then he gave me this other thing that like was against the roof of my mouth.

536
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:48,377
Speaker 1: It was all weird.

537
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:59,747
Speaker 1: and then uh You know what happened was is the wire on those braces like crept up into my gum and I you know I finally went to have it taken care of and like it was all bleeding everywhere.

538
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:00,530
Speaker 1: It's pretty nasty.

539
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:04,650
Speaker 1: So mom, I think she decided that that guy sucked and we didn't go back there.

540
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:06,446
Speaker 1: She said she said all right take him off and we'll leave.

541
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:06,749
Speaker 1: yeah.

542
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:14,639
Speaker 1: And then years later I went to the very very popular and wealthy orthodontist in the area And you know, he hooked me up.

543
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,712
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't go to an unpopular Orthodontist.

544
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:20,240
Speaker 1: go to the guy as much as you hate to go to him.

545
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:23,189
Speaker 1: go to the guy who's mad rich as a whole.

546
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:23,450
Speaker 1: mess.

547
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:29,570
Speaker 0: Offices all over the place has the doll like the special rewards like you get things if you get good grades and everyone's smiling.

548
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:41,633
Speaker 1: I was a bunch of before-and-after pictures all over his office and has like a room with 12 Dennis chairs and an army of you know dental guy people and Dental hygienists.

549
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:45,689
Speaker 1: Yeah and game boys all over the place for you to play while you're getting orthodontia.

550
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:47,759
Speaker 1: Those are the guys you want to go to.

551
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:52,236
Speaker 1: they're making a shit ton of money for a reason Yep, and actually the my braces.

552
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:57,510
Speaker 0: I had a very big difficulty with them because I had braces and I started playing the trumpet.

553
00:38:57,973 --> 00:39:00,249
Speaker 0: God, that was a long freaking time ago.

554
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,986
Speaker 0: Now playing a trumpet with braces is fine.

555
00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:03,530
Speaker 0: You can do it.

556
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:07,690
Speaker 0: And in fact, there's a a disadvantage in that there are braces in the way which screws up your embouchure.

557
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:13,207
Speaker 0: There's an advantage in that you can't put a lot of pressure on your lips without cutting yourself.

558
00:39:13,648 --> 00:39:20,175
Speaker 0: as a result You will learn to play the trumpet properly as in not using a lot of pressure Which in the end will make you a better trumpet player.

559
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:28,744
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm now fast forward to high school when I'm not really good yet But I'm as good as you can expect someone to be after four years.

560
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,708
Speaker 0: Like I'm pretty good.

561
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,299
Speaker 0: I'm okay I get to high school.

562
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:32,650
Speaker 0: braces come off.

563
00:39:33,113 --> 00:39:40,950
Speaker 0: I can't play a goddamn thing now suddenly Haha, and I had to relearn to play the trumpet because I didn't have this thing in the way and it sucked ass.

564
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,315
Speaker 1: Let's just put some thing in the way.

565
00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:43,319
Speaker 0: I did for a while.

566
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,707
Speaker 0: Oh, I had retainers that eventually stopped wearing.

567
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:47,857
Speaker 1: cuz didn't matter Yeah, I just stopped wearing my retainer.

568
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,310
Speaker 1: also it was supposed to be a nighttime only retain.

569
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine was nighttime only for the rest of my life.

570
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:54,590
Speaker 0: And after about a year, I was like fuck this.

571
00:39:54,871 --> 00:39:58,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wore it for like maybe some months and then I you know, it kept.

572
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:01,989
Speaker 1: uh, you know I'd forget to wear it or I didn't want to wear it.

573
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:09,667
Speaker 1: And then if you waited too long that it hurt to put it back in or it didn't fit Yeah, put it back in and like I think twice I went to get them to fix it.

574
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,490
Speaker 1: So it fit again.

575
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, then after that, I'm just like fuck this shit.

576
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was like I was supposed to keep doing it till I was 18.

577
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:17,369
Speaker 1: I did it for maybe a year.

578
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:25,090
Speaker 0: Yeah The best part of that is that the the ramifications of not wearing my retainer anymore were so minor that it was so worth it.

579
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:32,302
Speaker 0: I got a tiny bit of a snaggle tooth, which is no big deal and My bottom row of teeth curves in like a millimeter.

580
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:34,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, my teeth are pretty straight.

581
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:35,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't mind there.

582
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:38,167
Speaker 1: You know, it's not like they all stay in my mouth.

583
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:39,794
Speaker 0: Yep I never lost a tooth.

584
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:43,450
Speaker 1: of course part of my orthodontia involved the pulling of four teeth.

585
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:46,449
Speaker 1: You see the you know the pointy teeth the canine.

586
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:50,162
Speaker 1: Yes, the tooth right behind the pointy tooth the first molar.

587
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,470
Speaker 1: I had all four of those removed.

588
00:40:52,991 --> 00:41:00,236
Speaker 1: Oh all four of those are pulled out and then they use braces to pull all the other teeth Inwards towards the front.

589
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:04,170
Speaker 1: this had an advantage in that has made some room for the wisdom teeth.

590
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:05,910
Speaker 0: So you didn't have to go through that rigmarole.

591
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:10,888
Speaker 1: I got four wisdom teeth because I had four less than wisdom teeth pulled out.

592
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:12,336
Speaker 0: now I'd like to say one.

593
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:14,309
Speaker 0: my stepdad is an awesome, dude.

594
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:20,070
Speaker 0: He his wisdom tooth story is interesting because he had a fifth one.

595
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:21,434
Speaker 0: What now?

596
00:41:22,197 --> 00:41:25,690
Speaker 0: no one out there could guess where this tooth grew.

597
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:29,649
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember now it grew in one of his sinuses in the middle of his head.

598
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:33,167
Speaker 0: There's just this tooth in there and it's like those guys.

599
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:40,234
Speaker 1: you see You know The freak shows were like there's a mouth growing on the side of the face or there's some hair coming out of a place There shouldn't be.

600
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:43,390
Speaker 1: or there's a. you know, there's like a little nose growing somewhere.

601
00:41:43,711 --> 00:41:47,325
Speaker 0: He just has a tooth in there and the doctor said well does it hurt?

602
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,088
Speaker 0: and he said no.

603
00:41:48,148 --> 00:41:57,190
Speaker 0: and he said well I'm not gonna try to take that thing out But anyway, I'd heard all these horror stories everyone had ever talked to in high school because everyone was getting their wisdom teeth out.

604
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:02,130
Speaker 0: About around the time I was gonna get him out, you know, there's the span of like 11th grade.

605
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,638
Speaker 1: Does he put food in his nose and chew it?

606
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:06,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not visible.

607
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:07,510
Speaker 0: Like it's totally subsumed by flesh.

608
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:17,490
Speaker 0: yep, but between about 11th grade and maybe sophomore year of college seems to be like the window when a lot of people get him out and Everyone had a horror story and it sucked it.

609
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,189
Speaker 0: It was painful painful painful and they were like out of commission for a week and I'm not looking forward to this.

610
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,443
Speaker 0: So I go in and I first of all, I have a dentist.

611
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,010
Speaker 0: Well, I had a dentist who used the gas.

612
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:29,347
Speaker 0: He was a big fan of the gas.

613
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:32,850
Speaker 1: All the dentists that my uncle's a big fan of the Novocain.

614
00:42:33,312 --> 00:42:37,293
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the Novocain gets a big giant ass needle and shoves it right in there He's like, aha.

615
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:38,218
Speaker 1: No, you can't feel shit.

616
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,330
Speaker 0: But what he did is he gassed me, right?

617
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,790
Speaker 0: And this is the first time I'd ever been under anesthesia.

618
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:46,730
Speaker 0: I've never been operated on other than I've never had anything but local anesthesia.

619
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:53,995
Speaker 0: I gotta say it was an interesting experience because they put this thing over me and they said Breathe it.

620
00:42:54,357 --> 00:43:03,166
Speaker 0: and then I woke up in my house the next day like literally and I remembered these crazy dreams and I felt like I had been.

621
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:08,468
Speaker 0: I felt like I had been gone on Adventures for years and years and I woke up in this strange place.

622
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:10,938
Speaker 0: then I was like It's my it's my downstairs living room.

623
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:14,838
Speaker 0: Uh, and I was like, oh, yeah, this is my real life Not all that.

624
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:24,323
Speaker 0: and then I forgot all of it like I had all these crazy dreams and like this epic life and I all these details and They fled from my brain over the span of about two minutes.

625
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:26,050
Speaker 1: That's why people do drugs.

626
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:28,276
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what.

627
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:32,146
Speaker 0: the next day I went and played softball.

628
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,153
Speaker 0: I was fine There was no pain.

629
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:40,671
Speaker 0: Well granted there was no pain because I was taking a lot of painkillers that the dentist gave me But I wouldn't play softball the next day of course the.

630
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:48,230
Speaker 0: the drawback of that was I got hit in the forehead with a line drive while I was pitching and I didn't even feel it because of the painkillers.

631
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:51,036
Speaker 0: And they were like, are you okay?

632
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:55,670
Speaker 0: And I was like probably not but it doesn't hurt and I went and sat down for a while.

633
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:01,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I had those four teeth pulled, you know, I was I was a little kid and I was all like.

634
00:44:04,832 --> 00:44:09,514
Speaker 1: And it really only hurt when they gave me the you know Local anesthesia.

635
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:15,913
Speaker 0: that did they give you the shot or they did that where they have the thing that looks like a needle But they just like push goop onto it But the goop still hurts.

636
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:19,827
Speaker 1: actually what they did is a q-tips of goop and they put the goop into.

637
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:23,297
Speaker 1: you know Anesthesia from the local anesthesia that's coming.

638
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:27,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, then is the thing that looks like a needle but it's not goop that it squirts It's a liquid.

639
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:34,807
Speaker 1: and you know They just they get real close and they squirt this liquid all over and it pretty much numbs you the fuck up.

640
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,476
Speaker 1: and they did Two teeth and they did the other two teeth.

641
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:49,218
Speaker 1: and yeah, it it was it was it wasn't pleasant having them pulled But that was cuz I was a little kid and it really didn't hurt any more than like, you know a filling You know because it's the same anesthesia basically.

642
00:44:49,238 --> 00:45:02,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the pulling was sort of strange and Just irritating and weird and kind of woo Like oh my god, he's pulling out my tooth like it's a you know a corn on the cob or something.

643
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:06,469
Speaker 0: Actually, I got a funny story from when I when my first baby tooth fell out.

644
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:18,335
Speaker 0: I remember this very clearly because this tooth was moving around all the time and Everyone was telling me my teeth were all gonna fall out and I was real young and I'm not sure I was cognizant of the fact That new teeth were gonna come in.

645
00:45:18,356 --> 00:45:21,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the tooth like it kept moving around.

646
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,950
Speaker 0: I kept poking at it, but I was like afraid to pull on it because I was afraid it would actually fall out.

647
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:33,290
Speaker 0: and eventually it fell out one day and I was like, uh, and I stuck it back in and I kept it in there for a couple more days before I could.

648
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:39,060
Speaker 0: I kept putting it back in and like holding it there with my tongue And eventually it was just like it fell out.

649
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,265
Speaker 0: My mom was like, oh you do it fell out.

650
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,154
Speaker 0: I was like crap She knows.

651
00:45:43,018 --> 00:45:44,987
Speaker 0: and then she was like now maybe your new one will grow in.

652
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:45,610
Speaker 0: I was like new one.

653
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:49,549
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, and then I didn't care and I was waiting for my teeth to fall out to get money.

654
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:52,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

655
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:52,786
Speaker 1: Yeah.

656
00:45:52,806 --> 00:46:00,190
Speaker 1: Uh Wow, I remember when certain teeth fell out like they would be dangling by a thread and I would like spin them around.

657
00:46:00,472 --> 00:46:02,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, put my tongue in there.

658
00:46:02,405 --> 00:46:03,190
Speaker 0: I would do that.

659
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:13,050
Speaker 1: I'd spin around and show people and they go Yeah Like I had teeth that I like a point like perpendicular 90 degrees to my face pointing straight forward and that was fun times.

660
00:46:13,152 --> 00:46:13,949
Speaker 1: But I'm glad they're over.

661
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:26,517
Speaker 0: I remember there's a kid in my elementary school actually believed in the tooth fairy and whoa And it turned out that actually a lot of people did whoa and all I remember was that was the moment I thought wow, my friends are all dumbasses.

662
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:30,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't think dumbass cuz I was a kid and I don't think I even knew that.

663
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:37,605
Speaker 1: Term, I don't know what I thought but I think maybe the first time I was like, oh tooth fairy Yeah, whatever, you know and I stayed up to look and there wasn't one.

664
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:41,946
Speaker 1: and then you know I think I fell asleep though and that's when it you know, it came of course.

665
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:42,428
Speaker 1: I wasn't later.

666
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,559
Speaker 1: I was just like, oh, yeah.

667
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:48,220
Speaker 0: I was a very incredulous kid in that I never believed in Santa.

668
00:46:48,462 --> 00:47:01,393
Speaker 0: it was just at this thing I I actually pretended to believe for my parents because I kind of figured out what was going on and I thought that if I let him on that they know they won't give me presents or something or It'll suck.

669
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:06,290
Speaker 0: So I just pretended for a while and then eventually I kept pretending for my little brother.

670
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:09,490
Speaker 1: But yeah when I was super little I just kind of accepted things and went.

671
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,230
Speaker 0: I didn't right away.

672
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,685
Speaker 0: I remember when my parents explained Santa Claus to me and I was like But the thing is nothing has really ever explained to me.

673
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:17,509
Speaker 1: I just didn't really.

674
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:28,310
Speaker 1: And then like when I was maybe four I was like and you know I finally started to understand what exactly that, you know, people were say I was like, yes, and okay.

675
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:36,843
Speaker 1: And then we'd be like, okay this guy he flies around on a sleigh and goes in everyone's chimney But that the Jew chimneys and I was like, yeah, wait a minute.

676
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:38,710
Speaker 1: This doesn't sound real to me.

677
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:41,181
Speaker 1: It was before it was really explained.

678
00:47:41,241 --> 00:47:43,150
Speaker 1: I just didn't care and just accepted things.

679
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:46,222
Speaker 0: I remember they explained he comes through the chimney and gives you presents.

680
00:47:46,302 --> 00:47:48,874
Speaker 0: and I thought and the first thing I asked was What do you mean?

681
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:50,562
Speaker 0: the chimney our fireplace is fake.

682
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:51,407
Speaker 0: It doesn't go anywhere.

683
00:47:51,427 --> 00:47:51,889
Speaker 0: There's no chain.

684
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:55,362
Speaker 0: And then they said well if you don't have a chimney he comes into the front door.

685
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:57,029
Speaker 0: and I said the front door is locked.

686
00:47:58,193 --> 00:47:58,947
Speaker 0: Does he have a key?

687
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:06,170
Speaker 0: And and as a kid, I remember setting up elaborate traps which nominally were to catch Santa Claus.

688
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,220
Speaker 0: But actually I was hoping to trap my parents.

689
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:10,050
Speaker 0: It's like you're coming out and really ha ha ha.

690
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:13,070
Speaker 1: We had a chimney, but it came out into like this little black stove.

691
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:14,650
Speaker 1: It's still there and it works.

692
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:15,133
Speaker 1: You know what?

693
00:48:15,173 --> 00:48:17,489
Speaker 0: I would have done if how were your parents and you had the stove like that?

694
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:22,690
Speaker 0: I would have gotten a fake human skull and like our jolly red hat and burned it a little bit and left it in there.

695
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,594
Speaker 1: Thing is you're Jewish.

696
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:28,454
Speaker 0: So we yeah cause didn't come it doesn't matter and then open the door a little bit And then just make a funny joke.

697
00:48:28,594 --> 00:48:29,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just like.

698
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:31,884
Speaker 1: here's your present day two.

699
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:33,670
Speaker 1: Here's another present day three.

700

Speaker 1: Here's another present.

701
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:42,293
Speaker 0: Yep I think part of the my incredulousness was that I went to a Catholic school because I lived in downtown Detroit where if I'd gone To a public school.

702
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:45,810
Speaker 0: I would have been killed like the schools were bad.

703
00:48:46,232 --> 00:48:51,757
Speaker 0: So I went to a private school which happened to be Catholic and after the crap They used to try to tell me in that school.

704
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:52,882
Speaker 0: I didn't believe any adult.

705
00:48:53,204 --> 00:48:55,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe like let's go back Let's go back to teeth.

00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:05,942
Speaker 1: I like to bite thing.

711
00:49:06,524 --> 00:49:08,110

Speaker 0: I know you have.

713
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,070

Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we're gonna wrap this up.

723
00:49:30,562 --> 00:49:32,929
Speaker 0: We're definitely running out of stuff to say about biting.

724
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:37,042
Speaker 1: Yeah Did you have any interesting dental incidents to talk about?

725
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:39,710
Speaker 0: Uh, no, I have a bunch of fillings from when I was young.

726
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:45,550
Speaker 0: I have one filling from when I didn't go to the dentist for like two years because my insurance situation was dicey.

727
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,799
Speaker 0: You

728
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:57,232
Speaker 1: know I think the best times on Thursday geek nights is when we have a story like if we had a crazy story about how Oh my god, I miss tooth broke in half and then it was glued back together and it was crazy But

729
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:58,783
Speaker 0: I got to like all right.

730
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:01,096
Speaker 0: I got a couple All right one.

731
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:04,350
Speaker 0: I was really big into science Olympiad in middle in high school.

732
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:08,049
Speaker 0: I have a box full of like 40 medals from all this shit.

733
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:13,257
Speaker 0: and like we went to the state competition saw that and one time we went to the state competition and A friend of mine.

734
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:19,004
Speaker 0: I remember her name anymore She we won of one of the medals in the state the first time we've ever been to States.

735
00:50:19,506 --> 00:50:20,930
Speaker 0: and the state medals are giant.

736
00:50:21,191 --> 00:50:23,117
Speaker 0: They're these massive bronze things.

737
00:50:23,137 --> 00:50:26,327
Speaker 0: They're huge fucking pieces of metal and we were you know, young kids.

738
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:27,170
Speaker 0: We were in like eighth grade

739
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,004
Speaker 1: so

740
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:42,790
Speaker 0: We're out at a McDonald's celebrating and then we got to take the bus from Lansing back to Detroit well to sterling heights and she's jumping up and down and This metal bounces off her chest goes into the air and chips one of her front teeth in half.

741
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:47,126
Speaker 0: Whoa, like the front half of her tooth fell off and there's just like nerve.

742
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:50,437
Speaker 0: Whoa And oh good god that must have hurt.

743
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:51,461
Speaker 0: I felt I didn't.

744
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:54,753
Speaker 0: I couldn't be anywhere near her cuz she looked like she was in So much pain.

745
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:59,882
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I would have just run away and called 911 and then yeah 911 was called.

746
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:13,190
Speaker 1: there you go and Surgering was done and good God I actually when I was sitting in the dentist office There's something that really makes me cringe is Reading all those pamphlets and brochures and binders about different procedures and which one is right for you.

747
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:15,902
Speaker 0: Oh, the disease is getting me more than the procedures.

748
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:25,010
Speaker 1: Oh, this is one I didn't realize this before But you can get these dental implants like let's say I lost a tooth like it just fell out.

749
00:51:25,151 --> 00:51:27,380
Speaker 0: Oh where they put the screw in and then they screw the tooth on.

750
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:33,450
Speaker 1: you put us they take a titanium Screw and they screw it into your jaw.

751
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:34,270
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

752
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,530
Speaker 1: And then they put a tooth on top of that and you can actually change that tooth out, but it's not necessary.

753
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,481
Speaker 0: See, I'm fascinated by medical procedures and they never bother me.

754
00:51:42,702 --> 00:51:53,281
Speaker 1: See it's actually it's a very good thing You know, I mean if you don't do that your job will start to disintegrate and you'll get that old man with the lower jaw Sticking out and all kinds of bad shit will happen.

755
00:51:53,321 --> 00:52:08,930
Speaker 1: if you just lose teeth and don't put something in the jaw but at the same time think about a Titanium screw, you know what going into your jaw in a place of this a tooth missing screwing Screwing and grinding your jawbone.

756
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:11,478
Speaker 0: See, ah, you know what?

757
00:52:11,518 --> 00:52:12,724
Speaker 0: I think I think awesome.

758
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:14,030
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be like the million dollar man.

759
00:52:14,492 --> 00:52:15,860
Speaker 0: They're just gonna augment me all the one.

760
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,428
Speaker 0: I won't replace this joint while you're at it.

761
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:21,270
Speaker 1: All right Let's go pull all your teeth out and put titanium screws in.

762
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:26,290
Speaker 0: Well, the only reason I wouldn't is that currently natural teeth are still better than even the best artificial teeth.

763
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:28,157
Speaker 1: It's better than a titanium tooth.

764
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:31,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, natural teeth are really good for a lot of reasons.

765
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:33,218
Speaker 1: How are they better than a titanium?

766
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:33,821
Speaker 0: - god?

767
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:36,172
Speaker 0: I got to go dig up the Wikipedia and all that shit I read.

768
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:44,820
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean if you if we're getting old like an old geezer The one argument is that putting things like that in your body Your body doesn't like it so much and it causes trouble.

769
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:47,850
Speaker 1: It's not perfect actually causes more trouble if you just lose.

770
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,499
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, if you look the best answer is to not lose teeth.

771
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:53,650
Speaker 0: Yes, because also natural teeth are living things.

772
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:54,848
Speaker 0: They have feeling in them.

773
00:52:55,111 --> 00:53:00,230
Speaker 0: There's little tiny holes in your teeth that go to the nerve and that's how you feel like hot and cold and things through them.

774
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:11,206
Speaker 1: mm-hmm and Yeah, anyway, but the thing is if you're an old geezer and you're not losing all your teeth instead of doing shitty ass dentures You can just replace the really important teeth with these titanium screw things.

775
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:11,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's awesome.

776
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:29,142
Speaker 0: now what bothers me is when I see pictures of like someone who had a gingivitis and then it turned into a peridont Ida bada bada bidi itis and then job itis, you know when someone's gum just like rots away or the dudes have like one yellow tooth left.

777
00:53:29,383 --> 00:53:35,690
Speaker 1: the worst are the pictures of Like people who smoked or chewed tobacco and then their teeth get all screwed up.

778
00:53:35,931 --> 00:53:48,682
Speaker 0: Oh god, the worst picture ever saw a guy's mouth was maggot II with maggots Because he had a gum infection and flies got in there and Good God Good fucking God.

779
00:53:48,782 --> 00:53:54,700
Speaker 0: it was and it wasn't a Photoshop It's on Snopes somewhere and Snopes was like, yep, that happened.

780
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,964
Speaker 0: Oh god.

781
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,230
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, actually there's a worse picture than that.

782
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:04,130
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about cuz even good see no, no, no, no, no, no, I'll save it party.

783
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:05,637
Speaker 0: No, it's it's the it's the.

784
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:09,574
Speaker 0: it's the only thing other than this maggot II guy I have ever seen.

785
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:11,159
Speaker 0: that actually disturbed me.

786
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:17,921
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see it's not so much the procedures themselves that bother me It's it's imagining the procedures being performed on me.

787
00:54:18,182 --> 00:54:18,443
Speaker 0: You know what?

788
00:54:18,483 --> 00:54:20,770
Speaker 0: I imagine I'm gonna be drugged and knocked out.

789
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,684
Speaker 0: Then I'll wake up with an awesome titanium tooth.

790
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:23,087
Speaker 1: Yes.

791
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:24,174
Speaker 1: He has the part I don't imagine.

792
00:54:24,215 --> 00:54:27,974
Speaker 1: I imagine being awake and having this tooth Crammed into my mouth.

793
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:31,906
Speaker 0: and now my mom way back got our radial carotenomy our case surgery.

794
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:33,090
Speaker 0: like before there was LASIK.

795
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:55,962
Speaker 0: she got the old Russian eye surgery and The way they did that is that they gave you know local anesthetic and special anesthetics to where they knock you out for the most part but you're conscious and aware and can respond to stimuli and they ask you to do things during the procedure and you're fully awake and you can Feel them like cutting at your eye, but it doesn't hurt.

796
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:56,845
Speaker 0: You just feel pressure.

797
00:54:57,367 --> 00:55:01,115
Speaker 0: Uh, and Yeah Imagine that it's bad.

798
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:04,242
Speaker 0: or what about the rare cases where someone wakes up?

799
00:55:04,563 --> 00:55:11,030
Speaker 0: someone becomes aware and conscious during surgery But they can't move because of the anesthetic but they still feel everything.

800
00:55:11,997 --> 00:55:14,632
Speaker 0: It's rare, but it has happened That.

801
00:55:14,973 --> 00:55:16,117
Speaker 0: that is a scary thing.

802
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:18,624
Speaker 0: I don't want that to ever happen to anyone.

803
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:20,850
Speaker 1: Oh god, except for bad people.

804
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,867
Speaker 0: But oh, yeah, no even then because you know regarding the death penalty.

805
00:55:24,907 --> 00:55:40,243
Speaker 0: There's actually a news They almost did where the anesthesiologist of America are trying to band together and refuse to administer lethal injection on the grounds that the way we do lethal injection is Often horrible and painful and that there are much more humane ways to execute people.

806
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,932
Speaker 1: just fucking stab them in the neck now That hurts.

807
00:55:42,952 --> 00:55:44,297
Speaker 1: I'm shoot him in the head.

808
00:55:44,518 --> 00:55:47,650
Speaker 1: No, uh, cut him with a club carbon monoxide poisoning.

809
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:50,399
Speaker 0: It works that there's absolutely no gas chambers.

810
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,847
Speaker 0: No, those are cyanide gas poisoning.

811
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:53,670
Speaker 0: What the hell?

812
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:59,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're horrible and painful Because I there's this thing.

813
00:56:00,044 --> 00:56:02,816
Speaker 0: basically I Say what you will about the death penalty.

814
00:56:03,198 --> 00:56:08,550
Speaker 0: I am in a utopian world and in from an ideological standpoint I am an advocate of the death penalty.

815
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,740
Speaker 1: Why don't you just toss people into pools of acid?

816
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,010
Speaker 0: because I would really fucking hurt really strong.

817
00:56:13,131 --> 00:56:24,430
Speaker 0: I said like it immediately disintegrates you regardless Regardless of any of our views on the death penalty because I could talk at length about this and I'm sure all of you could If you're going to do it let's assume that the death penalty is going to happen.

818
00:56:24,994 --> 00:56:27,469
Speaker 0: I don't care what horrible things a person did.

819
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:35,310
Speaker 0: I I think that the the moment in which you realize that you were going to die because this isn't like being shot Suddenly or just dying somewhere.

820
00:56:35,832 --> 00:56:40,913
Speaker 0: This is where you've known you're going to die for a long time and then you know the exact moment You're going to die.

821
00:56:41,275 --> 00:56:44,890
Speaker 0: and then some men come and they do it and you're aware right up to the end.

822
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:49,041
Speaker 0: I can't imagine anything more to me not frightening but fascinating.

823
00:56:49,081 --> 00:56:57,870
Speaker 0: but to normal people who aren't nuts like me I imagine this being the most frightening thing you can imagine and I don't care what horrible thing you did.

824
00:56:58,232 --> 00:57:02,090
Speaker 0: I can't justify making that painful in addition to all of that fear.

825
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:04,259
Speaker 1: Maybe someone wants it to be painful.

826
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:05,766
Speaker 1: There were those pain likers.

827
00:57:05,786 --> 00:57:13,909
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I just I'm of the mind that we have the science to execute people a hundred percent painlessly and we choose not to do Stupid political reasons.

828
00:57:15,372 --> 00:57:26,048
Speaker 1: maybe what we should do instead of having the death penalty or jail is If you get caught committing a crime We just perform a painful medical procedure on you so that you don't want to commit more crime.

829
00:57:26,229 --> 00:57:27,995
Speaker 0: Ah I'm a constitution.

830
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:29,361
Speaker 0: cruel and unusual punishment.

831
00:57:29,461 --> 00:57:31,690
Speaker 1: That's not cruel or unusual quite cruel.

832
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:36,629
Speaker 1: It would not be cruel if we started doing it all the time and then it wouldn't even be unusual either.

833
00:57:37,766 --> 00:57:44,220
Speaker 1: I See it's only unusual if it's not done often I what was the comedian who was like unusual?

834
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:44,823
Speaker 0: what like?

835
00:57:44,843 --> 00:57:46,590
Speaker 0: hit a guy with a ball peen hammer until he died?

836
00:57:49,071 --> 00:57:51,158
Speaker 1: And that's not cruel either, you know, what's cruel?

837
00:57:51,198 --> 00:57:54,550
Speaker 1: keeping someone locked up in a room alone for years and years and years?

838
00:57:54,672 --> 00:58:00,850
Speaker 1: Yeah Are we pulling out a tooth or replacing it with the titanium tooth with no anesthesia isn't cruel?

839
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:03,249
Speaker 0: What if they gave me jetpack abs?

840
00:58:06,451 --> 00:58:10,990
Speaker 0: All Right, we've definitely gone off topic and we've got a lot of new topics for Thursdays now.

841
00:58:11,253 --> 00:58:12,470
Speaker 0: We got to talk about the death penalty.

842
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:16,962
Speaker 0: We got to talk about prisons in general and punishment and the ideas of punishment and crime.

843
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:19,610
Speaker 0: We got to talk about medical procedures.

844
00:58:20,692 --> 00:58:23,806
Speaker 0: We got to talk more about anime world order, but that's more of a Wednesday.

845
00:58:23,826 --> 00:58:25,874
Speaker 1: That's a Wednesday deal I think we have.

846
00:58:25,894 --> 00:58:35,510
Speaker 1: I think the end result is that we have to Skype with them and do a team podcast Where we all discuss everything because otherwise it's just not gonna be capped off.

847
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:38,525
Speaker 0: Well, I think what I'm gonna do is and we're done with the episode.

848
00:58:38,546 --> 00:58:39,410
Speaker 0: This is totally meta bits.

849
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:57,949
Speaker 0: Now I'm gonna read the email response I sent to them because right after we sent them the audio response I think was Daryl sent us a long kind of his feedback and just general feedback and All the points they were probably going to make and he made some of the points almost word-for-word and then I rebutted that with an extremely long email.

850
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:11,601
Speaker 0: and I just want to read the email because I think it was very well done and there were some points We made that they rebutted in the email But he didn't rebut in the show Which I was sad because I wanted to hear their rebuttal and then I wanted to rebut that rebuttal.

851
00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:14,690
Speaker 1: rebuts, but but but sex.

852
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:19,230
Speaker 1: When something's up, it's probably the butts.

853
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:31,018
Speaker 0: And On final note if you want to see us come to Connecticut in Hartford, Connecticut Saturday we will be there.

854
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,407
Speaker 0: It won't be hard to find us.

855
00:59:33,929 --> 00:59:36,630
Speaker 0: good God, is it not hard to find us at a convention?

856
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:42,810

01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:18,670
Speaker 0: say in opening ceremonies someone on stage Like has a thought bird moment where they forget the name of a panel and some guy in the audience yells out the answer.
