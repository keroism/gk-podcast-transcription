1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,687
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday February 21st.

2
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:13,192
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:15,458
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,923
Speaker 0: tonight We discussed katsu khan 13.

5
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:20,959
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:23,078
Speaker 0: You know what I did today?

7
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,063
Speaker 1: Nothing.

8
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:28,016
Speaker 0: I played raptor call of the shadows man.

9
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:29,260
Speaker 1: That game was hot shit.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,089
Speaker 0: The game is still hot shit.

11
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:32,033
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

12
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,118
Speaker 1: I mean doesn't remember this way.

13
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:35,948
Speaker 1: I Generally really don't like shmups.

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,430
Speaker 1: I never.

15
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:37,353
Speaker 0: I think that's just cuz.

16
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:39,000
Speaker 0: your skills at them are super low.

17
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:39,699
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,303
Speaker 1: I mean even like when I was a kid like but no one had skill at shmups and all me and all my friends were Gonna play shmups.

19
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,760
Speaker 1: and there was a point when I could have played shmups and become good at them.

20
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:59,500
Speaker 1: And even then at that early proto stage when I was just as good as all my friends I just didn't enjoy him and enjoy a space invaders or a Galaga or Galaxian not so much.

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,169
Speaker 1: No, ah, I never really liked space invaders.

22
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,573
Speaker 1: It's one of my terrible dark.

23
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,660
Speaker 0: So I don't like space invaders, but I love me.

24
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:08,367
Speaker 1: However Raptor call of the shadows.

25
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:13,286
Speaker 1: I not only love but considered paying money for Holy in the day.

26
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:24,978
Speaker 1: now remember that was from an era Where software piracy was not only rampant and unchecked and not only did there not exist copy protection of any At any value at all.

27
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:33,886
Speaker 1: But most people of my age who had video games back then weren't even really aware of the idea that piracy was somehow wrong Or illegal.

28
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:34,732
Speaker 0: that's true.

29
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:38,310
Speaker 1: the first video games I ever got other than the stuff that came with our computer.

30
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:42,547
Speaker 1: some guy just gave me a bunch of discs and I just thought that games were free.

31
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:49,920
Speaker 0: and then one day I saw him in the store and I was like, oh, yeah So I gotta come straight out with it and say I used bit torrent to get the full version of the game.

32
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:51,192
Speaker 0: It was an ISO.

33
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:51,898
Speaker 0: I burned the CD.

34
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:59,480
Speaker 0: I used DOS box, which is this great program that allows you to basically run DOS inside of Windows or Linux or whatever.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also DOS EMU which is better for normal applications But not so great for gaming.

36
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:11,050
Speaker 0: DOS boxes really come a long way and if there's a DOS game you want to play I mean this thing plays mech warrior 2.

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,040
Speaker 0: I think you can play just about any other DOS game.

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,767
Speaker 1: You've got mech warrior 2.

39
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:27,900
Speaker 0: it just requires a little bit of you know, relatively simple tweaking you know to get everything to work for any specific game and then What I had to do is I ran the installer from the CD and it totally just seg faulted.

40
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,271
Speaker 0: So, you know what I did.

41
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,159
Speaker 0: you're gonna love this.

42
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:39,132
Speaker 0: I copied all the files from the CD to a directory on the computer and in that director You know on the CD was rap dot exe.

43
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,517
Speaker 0: So I just ran the game.

44
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:42,350
Speaker 1: man That was I'm back in the day.

45
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,399
Speaker 1: All games are like that.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,730
Speaker 1: I mean when I first got sieve - I just copied it from someone else's computer onto my computer And it just worked.

47
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:52,079
Speaker 0: I know isn't it crazy?

48
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:57,936
Speaker 1: But anyway as we said yesterday and if you couldn't all figure it out We're back from katsu khan.

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,260
Speaker 1: We survived and we are now going to review katsu khan since it is anime night.

50
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:12,020
Speaker 1: If you want to hear about the video game room at katsu khan, you should probably listen to Yesterday's last night's episode where we actually talked about that in detail.

51
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, because half the khan or at least almost half the khan was just gaming of various sorts.

52
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:19,130
Speaker 0: So we reviewed that all yesterday on gaming day.

53
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:29,516
Speaker 1: And today we'll review everything else about katsu khan Plus, you know, we can turn this katsu khan experience into two shows though saving us a lot of thought and effort Not having to come up with another show idea.

54
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:37,316
Speaker 1: Awesome yeah, but before we do that we should do a little bit of news since you know, It is geek nights and every time we try to shorten the news or get rid of it.

55
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:38,140
Speaker 1: You guys yell at us.

56
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:43,599
Speaker 0: Yep, so I didn't mention this too much already because it wouldn't have mattered that much.

57
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,517
Speaker 0: But this weekend is the New York comic convention.

58
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:48,039
Speaker 0: take two.

59
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:57,060
Speaker 1: You might remember the previous year's New York comic convention Which I don't think the word debacle even begins to describe the catastrophic failure of that convention.

60
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:08,985
Speaker 0: well last year they tried to make a New York comic convention and they did and I tried to go to it and I failed Because they sold more tickets than they had room for human beings and they had a giant Convention in a very small space

61
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:16,028
Speaker 1: to the point that not even the guests of the khan or the VIPs were allowed in by the state Police and the fire marshal.

62
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if you had even if you managed to get a ticket You were lucky.

63
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:26,356
Speaker 0: if you know, you could get into the room and there are people with pre-registrations Who couldn't get badges or couldn't get in.

64
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:26,739
Speaker 0: it was dude.

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,393
Speaker 1: There were guests of the khan standing outside going.

66
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,860
Speaker 1: what the fuck is this shit Charles?

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

68
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,733
Speaker 1: Now meanwhile while you were standing in line trying to deal with that business.

69
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:45,039
Speaker 1: I was not there Because I generally don't like comic conventions and I knew better for other reasons and I guess I'm psychic I must have guessed that somehow something bad was gonna happen.

70
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:53,152
Speaker 0: Well the thing I would have known that something bad is gonna happen if I had known the crucial piece of information that they were Advertising the convention on television.

71
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,319
Speaker 0: and they're doing it this year, too.

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,120
Speaker 1: I don't know why in New York City where if you advertise anything on TV At least a thousand people are gonna knock on your door and ask what's up yet.

73
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,973
Speaker 0: So I don't think I don't know why they're advertising more than they have to.

74
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:08,928
Speaker 0: but whatever this year They're trying again and they seem to have learned from their mistakes.

75
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,817
Speaker 0: The Saturday badges are sold out.

76
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:12,900
Speaker 0: You can't get them anymore.

77
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:20,142
Speaker 0: So I assume that on Saturday that they won't have to turn anyone away because you'll know that there's no way in unless you've got A badge already.

78
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:27,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I haven't mentioned the con so much is because it's not gonna be easy to get in If you just found out about it right now.

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,032
Speaker 1: Well, unless you want to go on Friday only but Friday only.

80
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:31,900
Speaker 1: now that I look at it is kind of lame.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,740
Speaker 0: Well Sunday only is actually the hotness, but we're busy Sunday.

82
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:44,205
Speaker 0: My original plan was to wait and hear what people who went Friday and Saturday said and if they said good things That I would go Sunday only.

83
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,897
Speaker 0: but because of you know my life and what's going on.

84
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:48,820
Speaker 0: I have to go Friday.

85
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,470
Speaker 1: Oh, you're trying to make it sound like we're doing something awesome.

86
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,433
Speaker 1: We're playing D&D.

87
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:58,213
Speaker 0: Yep, which is awesome It is course, but yeah, so on Friday from 4 p.m.

88
00:05:58,454 --> 00:05:59,196
Speaker 0: To 9 p.m.

89
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:09,452
Speaker 0: Which is the only hours It is open to the general public and badge holders as opposed to just insiders on Friday I will be there and rim might eventually be there.

90
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:09,873
Speaker 1: Yeah.

91
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:12,020
Speaker 1: Well, I paid so I'm gonna go.

92
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,285
Speaker 1: I'm working in the Bronx.

93
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:16,720
Speaker 1: So hopefully I'll be able to slip over if I finish all my you know work business.

94
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I do to make money.

95
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:25,135
Speaker 0: I'll also probably start waiting in line around 3 Maybe 2 30 depends on what the train schedule is and all that jazz.

96
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:34,046
Speaker 0: just because you know most of the reason I'm going is because there's people I know that'll be there for the Internet's and While I'm waiting in line I can talk to them.

97
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:39,100
Speaker 0: So it's like having another hour doing what I would have done inside only outside.

98
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, so don't we're not doing anything at the con.

99
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,955
Speaker 1: if you run into us you don't.

100
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:45,886
Speaker 0: hey you don't have a table We don't have anything.

101
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:52,836
Speaker 0: We're just there as Guests not even as guests as normal con goers as normal schmucks.

102
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,160
Speaker 1: We're not press or anything.

103
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:57,595
Speaker 0: I might have a few flyers on me if they have a free shit table.

104
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:58,800
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll put flyers on it.

105
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,763
Speaker 0: That's it, man.

106
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,770
Speaker 1: It seems like comic cons are the only cons.

107
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,358
Speaker 1: We're really not trying to do anything at.

108
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,206
Speaker 0: yeah There is a Podcasting alley at the.

109
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,671
Speaker 1: oh, that's gonna be awesome.

110
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,878
Speaker 1: Well podcasters are also great.

111
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,083
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, they got.

112
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,733
Speaker 0: all the comic podcasters have little tables there.

113
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:16,355
Speaker 0: I assume.

114
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:19,087
Speaker 0: I don't know how big this is But oh, well, that's where they're.

115
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,836
Speaker 0: that's where some people might be.

116
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:21,640
Speaker 0: That's where I might be.

117
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,053
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I make fun of most podcasters.

118
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:28,251
Speaker 1: all the podcasters We actually know or have met at cons have been cool so far.

119
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:30,860
Speaker 1: So in the little probably meet some more cool people.

120
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically my goal here is to network a lot.

121
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:37,713
Speaker 0: also There's gonna be a few comic creators like Rushkoff.

122
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,280
Speaker 0: He has a signing from four to five.

123
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,079
Speaker 1: I'll probably be waiting in line so you can say hey, I won your contest a long time ago.

124
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,567
Speaker 0: Yeah Hey, do you know who I am?

125
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:45,989
Speaker 0: What's up?

126
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,036
Speaker 0: You're awesome and smart.

127
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:47,720
Speaker 0: sign my book.

128
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,389
Speaker 0: You want to be on my podcast?

129
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:55,292
Speaker 1: I didn't hurt to ask get him on the podcast, man I'll give you a dollar if you get him on the podcast.

130
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:56,660
Speaker 0: I'm gonna ask it doesn't hurt?

131
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,694
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd give you the recording bit, but it's still broken.

132
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:02,379
Speaker 0: No, I don't need the recording bit That's all right.

133
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:11,184
Speaker 0: I'm also gonna try to go around the After I walk around the you know main show floor once to see what the story is because there's no comics I need to buy.

134
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:12,068
Speaker 0: yeah at all.

135
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,048
Speaker 1: Well, you're not looking for Silver Surfer Issue 138 alternate cover.

136
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,412
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

137
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,100
Speaker 0: But that was the best Silver Surfer ever.

138
00:08:21,322 --> 00:08:22,880
Speaker 0: I don't even think that's such a comic exists.

139
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,523
Speaker 0: Probably not.

140
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:31,674
Speaker 0: but I'm gonna go around the artist alley trying to get some more pirate sketches Because that is one thing there is to say about the comic conventions.

141
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:59,880
Speaker 0: is the artist alleys while they may not be as big or as friendly and as awesome as the anime convention ones the percentage of high quality artists that are in there is greater because usually the tables cost a lot more and The old the people who get them are like the people who have jobs drawing actual comic books But they're not the super famous guys to like the semi famous guys the guys who are gonna be famous soon.

142
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:07,147
Speaker 1: So anyway, Tokyo pop it looks like they are revamping the rating system They're going to use for their manga.

143
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,058
Speaker 0: Does anyone even really pay attention to the rating system?

144
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:10,700
Speaker 0: that's on the manga.

145
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:16,757
Speaker 1: I mean really Most people know what these ratings even the ones for like the ERSB or whatever.

146
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:20,360
Speaker 1: Yes RB I don't think anyone actually pays attention to that at all.

147
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:21,104
Speaker 0: I don't know.

148
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:23,518
Speaker 0: as far as I'm concerned manga has two ratings.

149
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:23,860
Speaker 0: you ready?

150
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:25,940
Speaker 0: shrink wrap and not shrink wrap.

151
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,007
Speaker 0: Those are the manga rating system, though.

152
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,692
Speaker 1: You'll be happy to know that one now.

153
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:31,995
Speaker 1: It is much more fine-grained.

154
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:36,500
Speaker 1: They distinguish between moderate gore and extreme gore.

155
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:38,954
Speaker 0: So what's moderate gore?

156
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:39,620
Speaker 0: is that like?

157
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:41,496
Speaker 0: I don't know.

158
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:50,862
Speaker 1: Disemboweling or is that extreme go though interestingly they specifically call out occultism as you have to be at least 13 to read about occultism Uh-huh.

159
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:57,098
Speaker 1: and of course the most important thing you'll all be pleased to know that potty humor is all ages.

160
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,625
Speaker 0: Oh Thank God.

161
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:04,035
Speaker 1: I know I don't know we do without that I mean if potty humor was gonna be relegated to some higher level.

162
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,260
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could deal with that.

163
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,529
Speaker 0: I don't know if there'd be any manga for all ages.

164
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:12,912
Speaker 1: I Haven't read much in my life that didn't involve some form of potty humor.

165
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:25,070
Speaker 0: even in the count of mod and Christo There's a tiny bit You know would be hilarious like if somehow this rating system worked out or like Doraemon got a 13-plus You saw or Pokemon got a 13-plus.

166
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,556
Speaker 1: I could see that happening.

167
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:27,320
Speaker 0: That'd be hilarious.

168
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:40,929
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, this stuff is meant for two-year-olds in Japan, but in the u.s.. Thirteen or older, please things of the day.

169
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:49,261
Speaker 1: Now in keeping with my I don't know semi theme kind of randomly I got another dragon ball related thing of the day here.

170
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:51,890
Speaker 0: Oh my god two dragon balls in one week.

171
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,900
Speaker 0: What is the world coming to?

172
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,729
Speaker 1: I don't know what's going on?

173
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,793
Speaker 1: I mean the Hitler thing.

174
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:55,797
Speaker 1: before and now I got this.

175
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,664
Speaker 0: you didn't plan on this one.

176
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:06,990
Speaker 1: no no however I am pleased that for the first time in a while my thing of the day I found it, and I dug it and it had one dig and now it has a lot of digs.

177
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:08,136
Speaker 1: It's on the front page.

178
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:10,730
Speaker 1: I'd like to think that I contributed a tiny bit to that.

179
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:22,670
Speaker 0: Oh, so your thing of the day you found it before it was on dig And then it got dug to the front page after you decided on it as opposed to our current system Where we tend to not have anything planned, and then we pick something from day.

180
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:26,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, something that's already got a hundred or two hundred or a thousand digs.

181
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,012
Speaker 1: luckily a lot of people don't seem to read dig So it's okay.

182
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:33,767
Speaker 1: I know what's up with that, but anyway, but anyway a while ago.

183
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:34,790
Speaker 1: This is actually kind of old.

184
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:36,069
Speaker 1: It just made it to the internet.

185
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:48,230
Speaker 1: Dragon Ball and all that was re-released and in some sort of cool gesture a whole bunch of other manga Other than you know the great Dragon Ball master decided to draw their own interpretations.

186
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:51,000
Speaker 0: Who is the great dragon ball master Toriyama?

187
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,421
Speaker 0: Okay?

188
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:53,990
Speaker 1: Just making sure I know who did Dragon Ball.

189
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:59,450
Speaker 0: I'm just making sure that sounds like the rim will usually say something like that to cop out when he doesn't know something.

190
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:06,850
Speaker 1: Not only do I know about Toriyama, but I watched a musical that involved him at an amazement last year.

191
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:11,650
Speaker 0: Wow, I know that he did the arts also for Chrono Trigger anyway.

192
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:15,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't help but tell that if you ever watch any of those FMV's.

193
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,184
Speaker 1: But anyway a bunch of mangaka did their own interpretations.

194
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:25,190
Speaker 1: You know kind of as a thank you and Here's a compilation of all of them, and they're kind of cool.

195
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:30,189
Speaker 1: The sad thing is I like several of them more than I like Toriyama's actual work.

196
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:40,248
Speaker 0: Also, I like many of them are from mangaka where I like their interpretation of Dragon Ball better than the manga They usually write.

197
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,099
Speaker 0: So it goes both ways sadly.

198
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,509
Speaker 1: I haven't read many of the manga listed there.

199
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:50,847
Speaker 0: I only read maybe a couple of them and heard of some most of them actually.

200
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:53,118
Speaker 1: yeah anyway What do you got for me all right?

201
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:59,439
Speaker 0: So I found this cartoon now from 1937 or 38. it was actually from 38.

202
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,430
Speaker 0: It was a Fleischer Brothers cartoon called all the Fleischer brothers.

203
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,570
Speaker 0: I think it's called all's fair at the fair, and it's about the world's fair.

204
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,970
Speaker 0: And it's a pretty good short cartoon.

205
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,376
Speaker 0: And I picked this cartoon as thing of day for two reasons.

206
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:24,027
Speaker 0: number one if you think dubbing is bad on anime today When Americans dub Japanese anime you got to see this thing about dubbing in 1938 in the original language.

207
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,269
Speaker 0: I mean mouths don't move.

208
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:33,897
Speaker 0: It's basically like Popeye where there's basically some yammering going on Very rapidly.

209
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,227
Speaker 1: I think yammering is the proper term which is like hey.

210
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:36,809
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do this.

211
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:46,072
Speaker 1: hey they probably just found two homeless people sat him down in front of microphones and said watch this cartoon and talk and Say whatever.

212
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:49,726
Speaker 1: those people would be saying no just say whatever comes into your crazy hobo head.

213
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,713
Speaker 0: That's uh It's hard to tell.

214
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:56,470
Speaker 0: but second reason I chose this cartoon is because the world's fair is awesome.

215
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:58,235
Speaker 0: Oh shit is the world fair?

216
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:05,030
Speaker 0: us was well actually I looked on Wikipedia this technically still some sort of world Exposition thing whatever.

217
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:11,050
Speaker 0: 2005 it was in Nagoya and in 2010 it's gonna be somewhere else like Shanghai or something.

218
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,576
Speaker 0: but it's not the same.

219
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:20,657
Speaker 0: the world's fair was like an exposition of Everything that is great about humanity.

220
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:25,730
Speaker 1: It was just science and triumph and the human spirits and awesome waffles.

221
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:30,043
Speaker 0: And you know it was in New York in the 60s.

222
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:33,076
Speaker 0: my parents went to it and everyone I know went to it.

223
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,970
Speaker 0: who is older than me in my family?

224
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:39,310
Speaker 0: But I never got to go because by the time I was born it was gone.

225
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,098
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of that is that one.

226
00:14:41,118 --> 00:14:43,670
Speaker 1: we have an internet and now we're just in four.

227
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,592
Speaker 1: I mean back then you'd go to the world's fair And you'd see.

228
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:56,043
Speaker 1: you know like visions of the future and new technology and way back in the day like new Technology that no one had ever seen before would be here or at least no one normal had seen.

229
00:14:56,644 --> 00:15:00,582
Speaker 1: now if anything is invented It's on the internet immediately.

230
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:01,690
Speaker 1: I already know about it.

231
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,390
Speaker 1: I don't need to go look at it with a bunch of people at a fair.

232
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:14,326
Speaker 0: Yeah Well the difference is is that the world's fair is a place that shows Technology to all people and only people like us actually look up new technology on the Internet's.

233
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,610
Speaker 0: most people just don't care.

234
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:26,990
Speaker 0: But most people would go to an awesome fair where you lull them You know into seeing all this technology, and then you can inspire the awe of science Which is greatly lacking in our society?

235
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,230
Speaker 0: Yes, I think part of that is because we don't have the world's fair anymore.

236
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:38,524
Speaker 1: We got to the moon in 1969 and oh my god We got to the moon and now we don't care gonna build a base on Mars.

237
00:15:38,544 --> 00:15:49,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever too much money fuck it Exactly, and I don't think the world's fair was not the biggest reason that the attitude changed But it was definitely a part if only a small part.

238
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,798
Speaker 1: I got some ideas, but we're not gonna talk about that.

239
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:58,930
Speaker 0: when I talk about that now all I gotta say is world's fair is awesome And whenever I go to Queens, and I see the remnants of the world's fair I go.

240
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:05,931
Speaker 1: So I got a nice segue here, you know what else is awesome katsu katsu khan 13.

241
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,544
Speaker 1: Oh shit, so yeah, we were at katsu khan 13.

242
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:11,190
Speaker 1: We're finally bringing you our coverage.

243
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:25,028
Speaker 1: I will may or may not intersperse it with the things we recorded at the khan which range from us Rambling to each other because it was easier than trying to talk over the din To us attempting to interview these Phoenix Wright cosplayers who?

244
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:31,622
Speaker 1: Refused to come over but then joined our forums Apologized for being timid and ended up being cool.

245
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:33,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's up with that granted?

246
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,302
Speaker 1: We knew they were cool cuz they wasn't just Phoenix Wright.

247
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:37,849
Speaker 1: It was a whole Phoenix Wright cast.

248
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:46,554
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of people did the the Maya and the pearl and the whatever cosplay that I have never seen anyone try before even though It's kind of obvious.

249
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:49,710
Speaker 0: you would do that because it was made for cosplay that character.

250
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:58,350
Speaker 1: Well, but anyway I suppose we'll just go semi chronologically since usually we don't try to plan these things out as planning always ends in failure.

251
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,300
Speaker 0: All right, we got to the car.

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,110
Speaker 0: Well, do you want to talk about getting to the con?

253
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,777
Speaker 1: I will go over this very briefly.

254
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:09,670
Speaker 1: I'm sure we can save the actual story for a geek fable Suffice to say as we're about to leave one.

255
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,410
Speaker 1: There was a horrible snowstorm in New York State which crippled much of the state.

256
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:19,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got less of it than people farther north But we were still hit pretty bad with over a foot of snow.

257
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:27,930
Speaker 1: So Wednesday night Scott and I spent over an hour Trying to dig the four feet out of the driveway requisite to move the cars.

258
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:31,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have guys that the landlord pays to shovel.

259
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:34,297
Speaker 0: They didn't show up They suck.

260
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:40,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's my money missing But anyway, so we dig the cars out and then we get some Chinese food.

261
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:47,330
Speaker 1: the next day We go to leave and buy various odd acts of gods and fate and running into snow banks.

262
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,903
Speaker 1: Scott's cars alignment was out of whack and we didn't have time to fix it.

263
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:52,610
Speaker 1: So we had to take my busted car.

264
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:53,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

265
00:17:54,077 --> 00:18:04,690
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's the alignment but the car got you know pretty messed up in the wheels and the tires in general be trying to get it out of that driveway and Possibly before trying to get it out of that driveway.

266
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:15,090
Speaker 1: Yeah so at the beginning before we got to the con was basically total disaster and the fact that we Mitigated that entirely and still made it to the con on time amazes me even today.

267
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:28,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I basically went across this bridge with my car shaking like a monster brought it back over the bridge paid a dollar Toll just switched everything into rims car in about five minutes and then got on the road again.

268
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:32,072
Speaker 1: Yep, my car that was low on coolin Great.

269
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:44,048
Speaker 1: So whatever we got to katsucon Thursday night the staff in the video game room We're setting up and right away We realized that this was gonna be a good time because the staff were to had all their stuff together in a way that very few Cons ever do.

270
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:51,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we got there and I was waiting by the front door and rim went to go find someone to help us carry The tub of shit.

271
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:54,926
Speaker 1: Yeah the tub that weighed between 40 and 60 pounds.

272
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:56,511
Speaker 1: There's probably more like 45.

273
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,282
Speaker 0: Who knows we carried that whole thing so far.

274
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:00,085
Speaker 0: It was a nightmare.

275
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,149
Speaker 1: We mostly me.

276
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:02,817
Speaker 0: Well, you didn't want to.

277
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:04,585
Speaker 0: I offer to help you a lot of times.

278
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:05,047
Speaker 0: You're less like.

279
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,669
Speaker 0: no, I got it.

280
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,205
Speaker 0: So if you got it, I'm not good.

281
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:17,430
Speaker 1: Sorry fine Yeah, so we I want to do that, you know one person on each side deal cuz that didn't work so well on the ice All right, so we dragged the thing into the car, you know, we need someone to help us carry it.

282
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,278
Speaker 1: So I go find you know Aaron in the video game room staff and they sent me.

283
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:25,190
Speaker 1: they basically offered me as many roadies as I needed and anything I needed.

284
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,870
Speaker 1: They accommodated us far more than we even needed.

285
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:35,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like the couple times that I went and I said, uh, you know Can I get something that it would be there event?

286
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:45,910
Speaker 0: You know pretty quickly or as quickly as reasonably possible and like when I then eventually After like by the middle of the day Friday, I didn't need anything and then they were like, do you need anything?

287
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,729
Speaker 0: I'm like, no, what could I need?

288
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:56,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, so once you go out again if you want to hear about the video game room at Katsu con We talked about it last night on gaming night suffice to say it was badass.

289
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,130
Speaker 1: We got all our stuff together.

290
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:02,710
Speaker 1: We waited for our friends to show up who all took different routes to the con.

291
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:09,182
Speaker 1: I note specifically our friend Scott Johnson who last year got lost for two hours in the city And I told him to take the metro.

292
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:09,625
Speaker 1: and this year.

293
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:13,870
Speaker 1: He Didn't take the metro and got lost for two hours in the city, huh?

294
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:17,510
Speaker 0: Mmm, how did that happen?

295
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, Katsu khan.

296
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,350
Speaker 1: This is no fault of the khan.

297
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:22,538
Speaker 1: You cannot park at the con.

298
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,630
Speaker 1: do not attempt to drive to Katsu khan.

299
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,997
Speaker 1: You're asking for trouble.

300
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:32,244
Speaker 0: actually if you stay at the Marriott across the road Which does not have rooms at special con rates.

301
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:33,470
Speaker 0: It only has normal rooms.

302
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,470
Speaker 0: That's why a lot of people don't know about it, but you can easily get a room at it.

303
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,470
Speaker 0: It's right across the street from the con and you can also park at it for a fee.

304
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,186
Speaker 1: I assume yeah, and you know pay twice as much of money you will.

305
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,896
Speaker 0: you will have to pay money But it is very convenient.

306
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:54,058
Speaker 1: or you can park at the hotel about a mile away and pay but regardless You want to stay at the actual con hotel.

307
00:20:54,098 --> 00:21:03,110
Speaker 1: that adds so much to the experience of Katsu khan because it's pretty much The first or second biggest straight-up khan hotel khan of anything.

308
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:10,453
Speaker 1: yep, all the other anime cons are either in a stadium or in a convention center or they're small and Katsu khan has both things Going for it.

309
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:23,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, and once you if you're staying in the hotel I mean it adds so much that you can go back to your room and get stuff go to the dealer's room put stuff in Your room have a party in your room without having people tell people how to find your hotel.

310
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:33,665
Speaker 1: The fact that I can wander out of my room at 4 30 in the morning find that not only is Everyone still active at the con, but there's still a line for guitar heroes and DDR.

311
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,250
Speaker 0: That's good stuff right there.

312
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:44,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you ever go to Katsu khan the website tells you in red bold italics Take the metro we parked at.

313
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,046
Speaker 1: this metro station has a ramp off of i-95 Yep.

314
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:54,330
Speaker 0: So if you're coming from the north You can basically get off and exit on the highway and there's a parking lot right there.

315
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:57,329
Speaker 0: And as long as you leave on the weekend, it's free.

316
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:02,990
Speaker 0: So you park you get on a train the train you switch trains once which is very simple.

317
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,490
Speaker 0: The metro is not complex, especially when compared with say the New York subway got it cost $3.30.

318
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,342
Speaker 0: well one way.

319
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:19,650
Speaker 0: so six dollars and sixty cents Lordy yet to get there and back and it takes you about a block away from the convention hotel.

320
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:27,449
Speaker 1: Yes It also because when you walk from this metro station the one block to the hotel You will see every good restaurant on your way.

321
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:35,713
Speaker 0: Yeah at the same block that this metro station has is everything you're gonna need near the convention all these restaurants the CVS Etc.

322
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:44,950
Speaker 1: Now I got to say cuz last year I was impressed by this and then I forgot about it Land the year before too because I hadn't ever been to DC before and I forgot that Scott had never been here.

323
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:52,482
Speaker 1: so we get to this metro station and we're about to go up to the con and We come across probably one of the longest escalators in the world.

324
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:57,037
Speaker 0: It's also incredibly steep and Amazing and awe-inspiring.

325
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:58,322
Speaker 1: I totally forgot about it.

326
00:22:58,362 --> 00:22:59,165
Speaker 1: So I didn't the game another.

327
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:00,730
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna walk it up and Scott stops.

328
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,443
Speaker 1: He goes, whoa, look at this.

329
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:03,289
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

330
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:06,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's totally World's Fair quality.

331
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,644
Speaker 1: And then I stopped and said ah shit.

332
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:09,290
Speaker 1: We got to carry this tub up that thing.

333
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we get off the metro and a guy's like hey you want to take the elevator?

334
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,122
Speaker 0: We're like, no, we're cool with this escalator because the escalator that's right next to the train Platform is a little escalator.

335
00:23:19,182 --> 00:23:20,210
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh we can get up there.

336
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,770
Speaker 1: Just I'm pretty sure the guy muttered your funeral as he got on the escalator and left us to our misery.

337
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then we see the next Escalator.

338
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,963
Speaker 1: cuz I again I totally forgot about that.

339
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:32,064
Speaker 1: Yeah.

340
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:36,184
Speaker 0: Yeah I thought there was only gonna be one and then there was a hidden one.

341
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:39,243
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Do not drive to katsu-kan.

342
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:40,170
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

343
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,447
Speaker 1: You don't need to bring that much.

344
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:45,770
Speaker 0: Well drive to the metro station near katsu-kan and then take the metro the rest of the way.

345
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,890
Speaker 1: Yes now before we continue, I guess we can talk a little bit about katsu-kan.

346
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,622
Speaker 1: I mean it's in DC at the Omni showroom.

347
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:52,730
Speaker 1: It's been there for two years now.

348
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,148
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna stay there for a while cuz the hotel look like it's growing out of the hotel.

349
00:23:57,168 --> 00:24:01,848
Speaker 1: now I mean it it is but only in the sense that all cons are outgrowing their venues.

350
00:24:02,069 --> 00:24:05,390
Speaker 1: Yeah It's not outgrowing it in any catastrophic sense yet.

351
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:13,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there weren't really lines for anything besides Walk main events walking between any elevators.

352
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:17,501
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get to the elevators Yeah, but wait the first katsu-kan you.

353
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,278
Speaker 1: it used to be in Crystal City, which was alright But the Omni showroom is really a great area.

354
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:26,210
Speaker 1: There's tons of restaurants around of with various reasonable prices.

355
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:28,819
Speaker 1: There's a really really good sushi place right there.

356
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,273
Speaker 1: That is just expensive enough to keep the con riffraff out So there's almost no weight.

357
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:46,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean pretty much this location for a con of this size is absolutely perfect except for these small Fact that you can't drive right up to it Which is mitigated by the fact that there is a metro station.

358
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:49,030
Speaker 0: and actually I kind of like that because it filters out dumb people.

359
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:52,750
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson Alright.

360
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,917
Speaker 0: So what was going down at katsu-kan?

361
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,522
Speaker 1: Well, I talked about this last year.

362
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:09,203
Speaker 1: We mentioned it yesterday, but katsu-kan is Has a very well not very but has a fairly significantly different Demographic from most other anime cons in the north slash east.

363
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:16,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was definitely I noticed I mean rim was like oh, yeah, it's all older people and it wasn't really so much all older people.

364
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:23,030
Speaker 0: There are plenty of high school kids But I noticed that there was a significant lack of middle school kids like in other cons.

365
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:29,950
Speaker 0: They'll always be middle school punk kids around like remember anime next whole ton of middle school and yeah high school freshmen's.

366
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:35,567
Speaker 1: Remember you never ventured into the bar area where all the people our age tend to hang out during the day.

367
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:44,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true also but Yeah, there were basically no middle school kids, you know, the average age was significantly higher than at other conventions.

368
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:44,768
Speaker 0: I've been to.

369
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:48,387
Speaker 1: yeah I mean literally this is one of the few cons for someone my age.

370
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:58,650
Speaker 1: if I was looking for someone cool to ask out or hang out with or if I was all flirty Wouldn't have to worry as much about trying to find someone actually of a reasonable age.

371
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,910
Speaker 0: It's not to worry like is that one in high school and you know on an individual level?

372
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,090
Speaker 0: But in general your time is going to be easier.

373
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:11,969
Speaker 1: Yes now as a result of this there's one thing that goes on a lot at Katsu khan and that is drinking.

374
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:18,547
Speaker 1: Katsu khan is probably the drunkenest con other than penguin Khan that I've ever been to and will ever go to.

375
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:21,696
Speaker 0: I mean two people On our match game panel were drunk.

376
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:26,230
Speaker 1: Yes, which added to the hilarity Scott Johnson's troop of friends were drunk.

377
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:31,450
Speaker 1: Oh god, if you walk around the con at any hour, there are a significant number of drunk people.

378
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:37,750
Speaker 1: I would say that a good 20% of the people at that con are drunk by two o'clock on any given day.

379
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:50,570
Speaker 1: I don't know about that, but there's a lot of drunkenness going especially if you include the staff not gonna name names But non critical staff who are engaged in non critical activities or not above drinking.

380
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:54,227
Speaker 0: How many times did staff come up to us and be like staff booze run?

381
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:54,710
Speaker 0: What do you want?

382
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,210
Speaker 0: Like two or three times that was so fantastic.

383
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:02,690
Speaker 1: I'm setting up and I didn't bring any liquor with me because I don't want I have to do stuff at the con.

384
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,970
Speaker 1: So I didn't plan to be drunk the whole time and to I didn't want to carry it.

385
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,929
Speaker 1: I actually took liquor out of that tub when I realized how heavy the tub was so I never anything with me.

386
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:15,566
Speaker 1: The staff comes up we're buying liquor and I said pick me up a bottle of Southern Comfort.

387
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:20,164
Speaker 0: and they said, okay And they did yeah, and I put it in a flask.

388
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:20,707
Speaker 1: Yes.

389
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:21,310
Speaker 1: I put it in the foot.

390
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,090
Speaker 1: Now the thing is I didn't drink it from the flask through the whole con to get drunk.

391
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:29,503
Speaker 1: I drank it Saturday in sips throughout today because it was basically cough syrup.

392
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:32,050
Speaker 1: My throat was already gone by Saturday.

393
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:35,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually one thing I got to mention about this con.

394
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:40,741
Speaker 0: We bought those earbuds, right the the earplugs Yeah, the etymotic the $12 dealies.

395
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:47,030
Speaker 0: I forget what number they are Don't ask but if you go to etymoteic.com you can find them pretty easily.

396
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,372
Speaker 1: You know.

397
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:49,802
Speaker 1: in-ear musicians quality headphones Yeah

398
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,572
Speaker 0: they basically

399
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:50,793
Speaker 1: you

400
00:27:50,833 --> 00:28:06,370
Speaker 0: wear them and it reduces all sounds you hear by X decibels no matter what the frequency and I usually only bought them for concerts or Maybe if I'm going somewhere incredibly loud like there's gonna be a jackhammer in the street or something like that.

401
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:19,450
Speaker 0: You know but I wore them a lot at the convention mostly in the video game room where the comp the combination of all the music and The video game systems and everything else was making a tremendous amount of noise.

402
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:22,820
Speaker 0: And it actually had two side effects.

403
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:33,603
Speaker 0: one was that I saved my voice because I tend to talk louder than the things I'm hearing so that I can hear myself and Since I could hear myself talking pretty quietly.

404
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:40,530
Speaker 0: I didn't speak as loud So I saved my voice as opposed to what I would have had if I hadn't worn those.

405
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:42,121
Speaker 0: My voice would have been shot on Friday.

406
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:46,150
Speaker 1: now more importantly I mean we wouldn't have bothered if we were just you know people going to the con.

407
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:49,755
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say you should bring earplugs Only if you're gonna sit.

408
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:50,257
Speaker 0: where were?

409
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:51,421
Speaker 0: you were sitting for hours.

410
00:28:51,541 --> 00:29:08,114
Speaker 1: see where we were stationed at the head of the video game room in the old-school cabinet gaming area where we were blasting music 24/7 and where we had a live DJ next to us blasting beats whenever He felt like it made a million arcade machines blasting music with pop and music right there blasting music We.

411
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:11,210
Speaker 1: we would have lost some hearing if we tried to stay in that room as much as we did.

412
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:13,504
Speaker 0: Small amount of permanent hearing damage now.

413
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:20,377
Speaker 0: the other side effect Was that because I talked so quietly in this loud room a lot of people couldn't hear me Which is very strange for me.

414
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,769
Speaker 0: people don't often say what did you say to me?

415
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:31,130
Speaker 1: Usually the entire front row crew is telling Scott to be quiet and stop yelling yeah So oh well, which is what it actually worked out.

416
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,150
Speaker 0: I was like ah these earplugs saved my convention, and they did even though I got slightly addicted to wearing them.

417
00:29:36,492 --> 00:29:37,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott was wearing him.

418
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:42,430
Speaker 1: after we left the con I had to keep reminding him to not put them in and to take them out so I could talk to him.

419
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:44,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, also.

420
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:47,910
Speaker 1: I forgot to bring them to the rave which was alright cuz we only stayed in the rave for like an hour.

421
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:53,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually when I wore them at the rave like I could totally hear the music It sounded great, and I took him out.

422
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,924
Speaker 0: it just hurt.

423
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:58,808
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I don't know if that was relative or absolute though part of that was relative.

424
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:03,490
Speaker 1: part of it Was that you were standing a good five feet closer to the primary?

425
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,415
Speaker 1: Driving force of music.

426
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:09,368
Speaker 0: okay, there's a speaker right there cuz I took him out for like 10 seconds just to see.

427
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:13,650
Speaker 1: yeah I watch when you took it out your ear was directly in front of that thing okay?

428
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:16,003
Speaker 1: That's why I was kind of dancing with my back to it.

429
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:20,889
Speaker 1: ah Oh, yeah, but we'll get to all that as we're saying a lot.

430
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:25,550
Speaker 1: But we wore earplugs for most of the con just because it was loud and we had to actually do business.

431
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:29,810
Speaker 1: Yep, so aside from the video game room katsu khan is a typical khan.

432
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,748
Speaker 1: They have their main events room, which they is dual purpose.

433
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:34,922
Speaker 1: at night They use it for the rave during the day.

434
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:35,990
Speaker 1: these for the main events.

435
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:38,580
Speaker 1: They have I think the anime music video showings in there.

436
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,483
Speaker 1: Yep.

437
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:41,310
Speaker 0: They got what else they have in there.

438
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,726
Speaker 0: Oh the P Landers II concerts are in there.

439
00:30:43,746 --> 00:30:46,469
Speaker 0: Yes The cosplay is in there.

440
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,189
Speaker 1: We didn't actually go to the P Landers II concert, but our friend Corbin did.

441
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:54,750
Speaker 0: yeah There were two of them those one on Friday at 10 and one on Sunday at noon.

442
00:30:55,372 --> 00:31:01,097
Speaker 1: If you ever go to a con and P Landers II is there you should see them at least once because they put on A pretty good stage show.

443
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:03,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's not really I don't know what the music is Like.

444
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:07,754
Speaker 0: I don't imagine it'll be my favorite music in the world But people are.

445
00:31:07,955 --> 00:31:21,850
Speaker 0: it seems that while they're not the most famous thing ever and people don't go crazy over it And they won't draw a million people to the con It's still very entertaining and worth seeing especially if you're already at the convention and you have nothing better to do.

446
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,392
Speaker 0: Why not?

447
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:26,730
Speaker 1: It is very much more about the performance and the things they do than their music.

448
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:36,349
Speaker 1: Also, apparently though we were busy doing other things at the time they found their way into the gaming room Discovered the Wii area and proceeded to attempt to use them.

449
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:42,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, they played a lot of Wii over there and people were very much entertained by seeing P Landers II play Wii.

450
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:45,701
Speaker 1: god I'm entertained by seeing P Landers II try to brush their teeth.

451
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:47,590
Speaker 0: They're just yeah, they're crazy dudes.

452
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean other guests.

453
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:51,250
Speaker 1: actually, this is pretty cool.

454
00:31:51,351 --> 00:32:05,901
Speaker 1: but uh Ananth and Hawk from Apple geeks were at the con as guests and For various reasons due to the fact that Ananth is friends with our friend Ido and Ido was staying in our room with our friend Conrad Ananth ended up crashing in our room

455
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:07,829
Speaker 0: and being on our match game panel.

456
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:10,477
Speaker 0: Yes And everything.

457
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:14,730
Speaker 1: so once if you don't read Apple geeks, you should check it out Ananth at least.

458
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,803
Speaker 1: We didn't actually really talk to Hawk but Ananth is totally cool.

459
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:18,265
Speaker 0: Yep.

460
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,290
Speaker 0: He's a pretty awesome guy.

461
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,334
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll be honest.

462
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:26,962
Speaker 1: I don't read Apple geeks, but you'll probably find that entertaining though I will say that actually a Mookie was there from Dominic Deegan.

463
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:27,745
Speaker 1: He's a cool guy.

464
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:28,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, we see him at every con.

465
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:30,160
Speaker 0: We always stop by and say hi.

466
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to never read his comic.

467
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,430
Speaker 1: I was just like semi con friends with him and then I started reading his comic.

468
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,990
Speaker 1: So I guess I imagine I'm gonna start reading Apple geeks now.

469
00:32:38,653 --> 00:32:51,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was pretty funny that when I got back from the con someone randomly I I don't know where it was But they linked to an Apple geeks comic and I was like, hey funny you should link to that comic there Considering I was just hanging out with those people.

470
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:56,805
Speaker 1: Yep, so, uh the con itself in terms of general goings-on was great.

471
00:32:57,106 --> 00:32:58,290
Speaker 1: There were very few complaints.

472
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:10,669
Speaker 1: I went to the feedback form at the end because unlike most Katsu cons where I actually do all the con stuff we mostly spent our time providing entertainment to the con or Wandering around at what little time we could in the dealers room.

473
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:13,861
Speaker 0: Let's talk about those rooms there a dealers room.

474
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:15,707
Speaker 0: Actually, it was really awesome.

475
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:21,165
Speaker 0: Like I liked it Maybe more than any other dealers room except the Otakon one.

476
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:24,210
Speaker 0: I mean and the anime next one Don't forget the anime next one's also really good.

477
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:35,630
Speaker 0: I mean the selection of stuff that I wanted to buy was not as high as the anime next one But the atmosphere of the dealers room was probably the best atmosphere ever.

478
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:39,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I talked about this last year, but it's in kind of this converted parking garage.

479
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:43,062
Speaker 1: So despite the fact that the con might be slowly running out of room.

480
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:44,708
Speaker 1: the dealers room has room to grow.

481
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:45,189
Speaker 1: It's huge.

482
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:48,784
Speaker 0: Yet there was space in the back or people are just standing there and they're like.

483
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:54,202
Speaker 0: it was funny because there are parking spaces And I'm like, dude, and they had this cool like ceiling put in.

484
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,812
Speaker 0: that was pretty nice and it was cool Spacious.

485
00:33:58,213 --> 00:33:59,559
Speaker 0: the aisles were large.

486
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:00,443
Speaker 0: It wasn't crowded.

487
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:05,565
Speaker 0: You don't have to push people to see anything Yep, and the dealers were pretty quality also unlike Otakon.

488
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:10,310
Speaker 1: There's no BS Union can't sell food in the venue rules.

489
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,830
Speaker 1: So there was a bunch of dealers selling Pocky and stuff for pretty reasonable prices.

490
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:18,804
Speaker 0: The prices weren't reasonable right by it, but they you know compared to anywhere else there.

491
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:21,715
Speaker 1: Yes for normal con goers They don't have an Asian market next to them.

492
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:22,739
Speaker 1: They were reasonable prices.

493
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:23,842
Speaker 0: Yes for me.

494
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:25,248
Speaker 0: Those koalas were overpriced.

495
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,830
Speaker 1: now I generally don't buy much at dealers rooms anymore.

496
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,788
Speaker 1: I mean unless I see $5 DVDs or a captain Tyler box set for less than like 80 bucks.

497
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:37,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, if discounts are what you were after katsu khan was not the place.

498
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,739
Speaker 0: I mean there were a few places that had you know, the 20% off manga.

499
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,668
Speaker 1: one place had 30% off manga But it was all manga I had or didn't want.

500
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:53,030
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I got a few old manga for 30% off like a couple lone wolf and cub volumes and a dark horse manga.

501
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,750
Speaker 0: That's old and out of print, but that's pretty much it, but there's a lot of cool little stuff there.

502
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,670
Speaker 1: I mean, it was a generally good room, but I totally lucked out and I'm so happy with this.

503
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:16,690
Speaker 1: Randomly as I was looking through this one table that had some plushies on it I saw the little baby dragon from brave story the cute pink baby dragon Which that was one of my favorite parts of brave story, especially when his mommy arrives

504
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:17,534
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

505
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:19,485
Speaker 1: and I thought god damn it.

506
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:20,349
Speaker 1: Here it is.

507
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,295
Speaker 1: I looked through.

508
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:22,321
Speaker 1: it was the only one.

509
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:29,450
Speaker 1: there were definitely no more and I thought crap this thing's gonna be like 30 bucks like that cactuar and I'm gonna be forced to buy it.

510
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,682
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna feel bad about spending that much money on something blah blah blah.

511
00:35:33,124 --> 00:35:33,766
Speaker 1: I flip it over.

512
00:35:33,786 --> 00:35:34,288
Speaker 1: it was like 12 bucks.

513
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:41,399
Speaker 1: So I just I bought it without thoughts And I looked through the con.

514
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:44,490
Speaker 1: I went to the dealers room three more times and asked around there were no more.

515
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,576
Speaker 1: It was the only one.

516
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,029
Speaker 1: the guy didn't even know what it was who sold it to me.

517
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:49,053
Speaker 0: That's right.

518
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:50,337
Speaker 0: Why I only charge 12 bucks.

519
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:52,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm totally pumped about it.

520
00:35:52,604 --> 00:35:54,310
Speaker 1: It's sitting next to me now looking at me.

521
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:55,232
Speaker 0: Yeah Am I?

522
00:35:55,352 --> 00:36:04,070
Speaker 0: the only other things I bought in the dealers room besides that manga where I found a little tiny Plastic Tachikoma and it's like a set, you know, it's one of those ones you buy.

523
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:10,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, you buy a little cardboard box and you don't know what toy is gonna be inside.

524
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:16,990
Speaker 0: But this set the only options were like blue Tachikoma red Tachikoma green Tachikoma, right?

525
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:21,645
Speaker 0: So I bought it and I got orange Tachikoma, which is just fine.

526
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:23,010
Speaker 0: I didn't really care what color it was.

527
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:25,360
Speaker 1: So Scott where I'm bad the deal is.

528
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,610
Speaker 0: so I went after I bought this and I was done.

529
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,321
Speaker 0: I went back to the video game room where rim was sitting

530
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,570
Speaker 1: and I'm sitting there with his grin on my face

531
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,283
Speaker 0: And I'm like hey rim check out what I bought and I pull out my little orange Tachikoma

532
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:38,467
Speaker 1: and you cause

533
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:42,246
Speaker 0: about like an Inch not even an inch tall and made of plastic.

534
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,822
Speaker 1: now There's a famous movie that pretty much shows exactly what happened.

535
00:36:46,244 --> 00:36:47,670
Speaker 1: You call that a Tachikoma.

536
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:53,565
Speaker 1: This is a Tachikoma because right then I had found in the dealer's room for also very little money.

537
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:59,544
Speaker 1: It was like 16 bucks a Really big high quality Tachikoma plushie.

538
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:01,090
Speaker 1: It's like a foot tall.

539
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:02,804
Speaker 0: Rim went mad with the plushies.

540
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:07,602
Speaker 0: He got two Big ass normal sized plushies of quality.

541
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:07,943
Speaker 0: Yeah.

542
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:14,350
Speaker 1: See the thing is I don't buy cheap plushies I'll buy the highest of quality plushies and these happen to be really cheap and yet really high quality.

543
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty much plushied out at this point.

544
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:18,470
Speaker 0: I mean, I've got them all stuffed into a little box.

545
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,093
Speaker 1: I think I've got.

546
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,058
Speaker 1: I don't need any more.

547
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:20,761
Speaker 1: I'm almost set.

548
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:21,585
Speaker 1: I've got the dragon.

549
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:22,490
Speaker 1: I've got the Tachikoma.

00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:23,995
Speaker 1: I've got the one-up mushroom.

00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,380
Speaker 1: I've got the Cactuar.

552
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:26,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am.

553
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,170
Speaker 1: I've got the initial D car.

554
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:30,117
Speaker 1: Yep, what else do I need?

555
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:30,980
Speaker 1: We've got the Cthulhu.

556
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,522
Speaker 0: not much.

557
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:33,308
Speaker 0: All right, so the dealer's room.

558
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:34,815
Speaker 0: Akatsukan I give it.

559
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,747
Speaker 0: I give it a A. It's a good.

560
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:37,689
Speaker 0: it's a good dealers All right.

561
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,988
Speaker 1: So on to the artists alley because we covered that there was supposedly ahead of time some controversy.

562
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:45,130
Speaker 1: you see Tex He was actually a good friend of ours who runs the artists alley.

563
00:37:45,612 --> 00:37:59,589
Speaker 1: They kind of changed the rules of this year kind of like what Otacon did with their you know Strictifying it and worrying more about copyright and also with a twist of trying to promote original art more and the actual two-dimensional Art more and less fan art and that sort of thing.

564
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,741
Speaker 1: Now the internet made a big deal about this.

565
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:18,070
Speaker 1: to quote someone funny at the con the internet lost its shit about And there was this crazy uproar and a bunch of people actually contacted us Because you know they talked to us about the Otacon thing and they wanted you know, like are you gonna cover this?

566
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,216
Speaker 1: We're all set for interviews.

567
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,040
Speaker 1: We're all set to go.

568
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,850
Speaker 1: There's gonna be big protest at the con.

569
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:23,223
Speaker 1: The artist alley is gonna fail.

570
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:23,930
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

571
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:29,615
Speaker 1: So the thing is I didn't really worry about it because Texas Competent at what he does.

572
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wasn't worried about it either.

573
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:36,910
Speaker 0: apparently, you know at the end of it It's like he said at least I'm pretty sure is what he said is that at the end of the day?

574
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,949
Speaker 0: People just want to come in and have fun selling shit.

575
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:48,064
Speaker 1: And the thing is the quality of the artists alley was not Diminished in any way that I could tell from the previous year by the new rules.

576
00:38:48,646 --> 00:38:49,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I went in there.

577
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:51,299
Speaker 0: I saw the same stuff.

578
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,873
Speaker 0: I tend to see in artists alleys I saw.

579
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:57,585
Speaker 0: you know about the typical ratio of high quality to low quality.

580
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:03,289
Speaker 0: There are people selling crafts There are people selling fan art in various things like that.

581
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:13,794
Speaker 1: Yep I mean while the rules were stricter The thing is far more people want tables at Katsu khan than there are tables at which point you need some sort of arbitrary Mechanism.

582
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:22,190
Speaker 1: the mechanism he used looks like in the end It did cut out some less quality people and in the end as a result the artist alley was probably better than the previous year.

583
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:51,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean while the principles of the mechanism might be so agreeable with us at the same time You know as opposed to a lottery in which you're basically getting a random sampling and you could potentially end up with all crap and having some high quality people left out or a first-come first-serve where only the craziest people will get tables and the you know better People who might have less time to worry about this kind of shit and more time spending on art might not get in His.

584
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:55,465
Speaker 0: these rules actually semi filtered out some local.

585
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,910
Speaker 0: I mean low quality stuff.

586
00:39:57,534 --> 00:40:04,467
Speaker 1: I guess I mean honestly Katsu khan's artist alley In my opinion is second really only to Otakon at least in terms of the Khans I go to.

587
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:12,617
Speaker 0: yeah I mean the other thing about the artists alley is that While it was staffed only some hours of the day It was technically open 24/7.

588
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:16,942
Speaker 0: now not every artist would sit at their table 24/7.

589
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:23,027
Speaker 0: of course they don't have time for that, you know, plus they want to do other stuff But it was always a fun hangout place, you know.

590
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:26,084
Speaker 0: nine at night You could go and maybe there'd be an artist to talk to.

591
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:26,708
Speaker 1: yeah or two.

592
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,288
Speaker 1: in the morning You'd go and hang out there.

593
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:33,390
Speaker 0: Yeah And plus if one of your favorite artists is in there maybe a webcomic artist hanging out there at nine.

594
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:38,490
Speaker 0: What better time to go and hang out and talk to them instead of during the day when there's a line of people going?

595
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,032
Speaker 0: Hi, how you doing?

596
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,098
Speaker 0: How you doing now?

597
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:42,110
Speaker 1: Of course, we went to the art show which was met.

598
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,675
Speaker 1: There wasn't anything notable really.

599
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:47,910
Speaker 1: we went into the porn area for a joke and there was like one thing hanging there.

600
00:40:48,294 --> 00:40:52,621
Speaker 0: It was just like tasteful Normal paintings from a nude model.

601
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:52,962
Speaker 0: Yeah.

602
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,070
Speaker 1: I was really surprised that it was tasteful back there.

603
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:59,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there was some less tasteful stuff that was in the non porn area.

604
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:06,552
Speaker 1: Yeah However, we're going through and we're pretty picky and we so we didn't really see anything that stood out other than stuff We've seen before.

605
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:10,502
Speaker 1: and then the last thing we looked at was really cool.

606
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:13,390
Speaker 1: There's a little shy guy Valentine's thing with two toads.

607
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a shy guy and he obviously wanted to ask out this toad girl.

608
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,750
Speaker 0: But the toad girl was all with the toad guys because the shy guy was too shy so he he missed out.

609
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:22,555
Speaker 1: It was really cute.

610
00:41:22,575 --> 00:41:31,561
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing we like and so sure enough We look at the name of the person who did it and at almost every con we go to We'll see this guy's art and think wow.

611
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:32,264
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

612
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:32,706
Speaker 1: Who is it?

613
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:33,590
Speaker 1: It's always the same guy.

614
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:36,430
Speaker 0: I mentioned him after the last Otakon show.

615
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:45,323
Speaker 0: his name is Brandon Kramer and his website is brandokay.com and His art is to awesomes.

616
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:46,530
Speaker 1: he I don't know what it is.

617
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:52,930
Speaker 1: It's a combination of skill and knowing what things to combine to make people like us lose our shit.

618
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:59,530
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I think what it is is that he does have a great deal of artistic talents from going to art schools and such.

619
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:06,550
Speaker 0: His artistic style and aesthetic appeals greatly to the likes of us as do it as does his subject matter.

620
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,450
Speaker 0: Yes, and his subject matter is our geek button.

621
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:13,864
Speaker 0: It's like a big hammer that just hits our geek buttons like a hundred times.

622
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:18,149
Speaker 1: Yep, so instead I mean you even had him draw something in your a pirate book.

623
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:20,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, that way he drew bonebeard in the pie.

624
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,825
Speaker 0: I think he was the first one to draw in the pirate book and bonebeard is still super quality.

625
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,350
Speaker 0: bonebeard is so awesome.

626
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:32,389
Speaker 1: I think even when you fill the book even if bonebeard doesn't end up being the number one pirate He's gonna hold his own to the end.

627
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,297
Speaker 0: I think bonebeard will definitely hold his own.

628
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:41,210
Speaker 0: to end I got a scan in bonebeard at one of these days, but Yeah, also he was selling a new merchandise there.

629
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,902
Speaker 0: He had a sticker that said security provided by phanto.

630
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:47,467
Speaker 1: if you don't know who phanto is.

631
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:48,710
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna cry for your soul.

632
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all we're gonna say about that.

633
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:51,666
Speaker 0: We bought those stickers.

634
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:56,830
Speaker 1: Yes I was going to put it in my car for the ride home in the window because it's a car window sticker.

635
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:02,370
Speaker 1: But I might be buying a new car and I don't wanna have to buy another phantos.

636
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:04,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a $5 sticker, which is well worth it.

637
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:10,990
Speaker 1: But oh well Yeah, but this guy's awesome and we're gonna try to get him on the show at some point and interview him just cuz he's cool.

638
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:12,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's way cool.

639
00:43:12,777 --> 00:43:15,870
Speaker 0: And we're probably gonna get in to do some arts for us cuz we need arts.

640
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, so watch out for him at any artists alley of any kind you go to.

641
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:19,346
Speaker 1: yep.

642
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:22,760
Speaker 1: But anyway, the con itself was really well run.

643
00:43:23,322 --> 00:43:25,410
Speaker 1: It's generally more a social con than other counts.

644
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,529
Speaker 1: The programming is light especially considering how many people are there?

645
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:34,170
Speaker 1: So while you'll do all the con stuff you go to the cosplay the anime music video showings go to a couple panels.

646
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:37,330
Speaker 1: Generally you'll spend most of your time hanging out with cool people.

647
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:47,450
Speaker 0: Yeah At pretty much any point in time The hallways were filled on both sides with people just sitting around hanging out and the lobby was loaded with people standing around hanging out.

648
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,210
Speaker 1: Yep, the lobby was half cosplay pictures half just cool people hanging out.

649
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,798
Speaker 0: That's actually something cool about katsu katas.

650
00:43:53,838 --> 00:44:06,670
Speaker 0: instead of just people taking cosplay pictures randomly all over the place getting in the way They have little areas like in every hallway that say take cosplay pictures here and there's a sheet To make a nice background for your pictures and everything, you know.

651
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,381
Speaker 0: So it's like don't take your picture over there and get in everyone's way.

652
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:11,429
Speaker 0: There's a little out of the way do these?

653
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:17,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a nook right here with a sheet that you can take pictures in front of this design for taking pictures in front of It.

654
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:19,610
Speaker 0: so people do that and it works out really well.

655
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,570
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of cosplay photo photography traffic, even though there's a lot of cosplay photography.

656
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:32,959
Speaker 1: Yep, there were in fact a lot of nooks in the hotel many of which were unused and I think next year as the con grows We should poke into using those nooks more effectively.

657
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,510
Speaker 0: I think those nooks can be used in many many many ways for awesome.

658
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:44,250
Speaker 1: Yes, but generally, you know people would hang out in the video game room a lot Even though the video game room was more of a loud thumping party time all night.

659
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:50,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, or they hang on the artist alley which was quiet and every time I went there even at 3 in the morning It was just people kind of quietly having.

660
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,464
Speaker 1: you know, normal cool.

661
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:53,408
Speaker 1: I'm a geek.

662
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:54,030
Speaker 1: You're a geek, too.

663
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,240
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the things we like conversations.

664
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:56,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

665
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:57,365
Speaker 0: All right.

666
00:44:57,425 --> 00:45:00,277
Speaker 0: What about the Video rooms at katsu khan.

667
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,402
Speaker 0: Did you go into any at all?

668
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,370
Speaker 1: I don't go to video rooms to any con ever.

669
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:07,100
Speaker 0: Well, we usually go see live-action movies from Asia.

670
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,650
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the thing is katsu khan's video rooms were like any cons video rooms.

671
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:11,409
Speaker 1: They were well run.

672
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,394
Speaker 1: They've showed whatever.

673
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:16,850
Speaker 1: the cool thing was though that one of the rooms had a lot of live-action Asian cinema.

674
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:24,229
Speaker 0: We had two rooms of anime and one room of live-action But I would probably would have gone to the live-action room at some point.

675
00:45:24,651 --> 00:45:34,999
Speaker 0: But the con program was organized in a way that made it slightly more difficult to figure out what the different movies were Mostly because you weren't willing to put the trivial effort.

676
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,280
Speaker 0: Yes.

677
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:37,308
Speaker 0: I wasn't willing to put in any effort at all.

678
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:43,863
Speaker 0: So Not knowing what the movies were I wasn't willing to take the time out of my day to go and watch them.

679
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:47,316
Speaker 1: thing is you can tell by the titles which Ones were awesome and which ones weren't.

680
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:48,219
Speaker 0: I don't know.

681
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,050
Speaker 0: Let me look at some of these titles here electric dragon 8,000 V.

682
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:51,896
Speaker 0: 80,000 V. that's gonna be awesome.

683
00:45:55,492 --> 00:45:57,730
Speaker 1: The hidden blade that's gonna be awesome.

684
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,208
Speaker 1: 36th chamber of Shaolin that's gonna be twice as awesome as anything you've said so far.

685
00:46:05,072 --> 00:46:06,620
Speaker 0: Blood sport blood sport.

686
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that movie.

687
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:11,303
Speaker 1: I wonder if that was actually the van the which one is it?

688
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:12,750
Speaker 1: Is there some Japanese blood?

689
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:13,212
Speaker 1: I don't know.

690
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:16,630
Speaker 0: I have to look in these slightly disorganized program to find out.

691
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:20,810
Speaker 1: Oh, I think part of it was more that we were actually busy for the whole con and it ode to con.

692
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:29,509
Speaker 1: Other than our dying tradition of the Saturday midnight movie We tend to only go into the live-action rooms to watch stuff when there's nothing else going on.

693
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:30,974
Speaker 1: Yep, Katsu khan.

694
00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:32,801
Speaker 1: We had stuff going on pretty much 24/7.

695
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:35,030
Speaker 1: So we really didn't have time to watch anything.

696
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:43,390
Speaker 0: I did stop in and watch Five minutes of an anime randomly just to see what the video room looked like and it was a pretty typical video room.

697
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,549
Speaker 0: You could see and hear the show from everywhere in the room.

698
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:56,363
Speaker 0: They were actually watching a dub and I found out later the show was Animation runner kuromi, which is a show I've heard the name of but never actually known what the show was about.

699
00:46:56,825 --> 00:47:13,369
Speaker 0: and from watching five minutes The show is about this girl who runs around to all these animators around town and collects their work and brings it back to the animation studio and she has to pester all of them to get their work done on time and Only the bishonen guy gets his work done on time.

700
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:17,339
Speaker 0: So if you're looking for a cute funny show.

701
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:22,296
Speaker 0: that might be the one because it didn't look scary or bad in any way from My five-minute judgment.

702
00:47:22,638 --> 00:47:25,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, the showings at Katsu khan serve their purpose and we're done.

703
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:30,172
Speaker 1: Well, also the industry had set up a bunch of TVs around Showcasing.

704
00:47:30,252 --> 00:47:31,436
Speaker 1: you mean funimation.

705
00:47:31,576 --> 00:47:33,021
Speaker 1: Yeah funimation, which is doing?

706
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:36,420
Speaker 1: as far as I can guess funimation is doing well I'm anime.

707
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:41,270
Speaker 0: funimation I think recently made a press release that said we are number one in anime in the u.s.

708
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:48,854
Speaker 1: And I believe it because while I don't like all the things they put out lately they're the ones who have been consistently Selling stuff.

709
00:47:49,296 --> 00:47:53,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, they got the full metal alchemist in the one pieces and all the the big ones.

710
00:47:53,690 --> 00:48:02,338
Speaker 1: They're also the ones who actually seem to have enough of a budget to appear at cons and give free stuff out again Which there's been a drought of free stuff from the industry for a while now.

711
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:06,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think another factor is where is funimation located?

712
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,614
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about that.

713
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:10,990
Speaker 1: I know more about the Japanese companies than I do about the American ones these days.

714
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:18,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I know the ATV is in Texas and like visas in California So they often don't show up at the East Coast cons.

715
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,212
Speaker 1: I mean, yes, it's really big all I used to know about pioneer because they used to put out all the stuff I like.

716
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:26,545
Speaker 1: yeah, they're genie on yep, and that's when I stopped knowing about them.

717
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:32,386
Speaker 1: Oh, well Yeah, but the showing rooms were good enough and they had you know, the demo stations all around showing.

718
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:33,610
Speaker 1: mostly it looked like moon phase.

719
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:52,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just had TVs showing their latest stuff and demo DVDs to get people to like funimation and they gave away free funimation crap and funimation t-shirts and there were these funimation ad posters posted everywhere and They had a little booth in the lobby instead of the dealers room or anywhere else.

720
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,148
Speaker 0: and oh, they did their thing.

721
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:55,212
Speaker 0: Whatever Yep.

722
00:48:55,694 --> 00:49:04,065
Speaker 1: Now briefly there was also the live gaming room which Smelled like the unholy armpit of the worst fanboy in the world.

723
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:05,490
Speaker 1: I swear to God.

724
00:49:06,132 --> 00:49:07,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoever they?

725
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,690
Speaker 1: luckily the staff is fully aware of this.

726
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,482
Speaker 1: It was mentioned and men in numerous places.

727
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,069
Speaker 1: I'm sure they're going to deal with it next year.

728
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:22,408
Speaker 1: Also, we will probably hopefully be running German board game demos in there at late at night and not permitting smelly people.

729
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:28,470
Speaker 1: Oh god If there were smelly people, yeah, if a smelly person come into that video game room, they would have been dealt with too sweet.

730
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:34,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess the only other thing going on at kazakhon was all the panels which we didn't really go to any of them.

731
00:49:34,992 --> 00:49:36,329
Speaker 0: So we can't say much about them.

732
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,815
Speaker 1: Well, I can say one thing.

733
00:49:38,136 --> 00:49:54,469
Speaker 1: I showed up at the feedback panel because since I didn't do a much at the con That I could report on other than the fun stuff I did which I'll probably talk about some other night because you guys don't care about the funny stuff that happened in the room or the time when Bruce paralyzed the Entire crew with laughter for like five minutes.

734
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:59,699
Speaker 1: Okay We'll have to tell all those stories another time.

735
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:03,780
Speaker 1: but in terms of the con itself I didn't have much to report on.

736
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,818
Speaker 1: so I went to the feedback session to see what was What people talked about and I missed the beginning.

737
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:16,010
Speaker 1: but apparently our panel our game show was called out Specifically by someone in the audience as being the hot shit.

738
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:19,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean our little game show at 10 p.m.

739
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:24,607
Speaker 0: On Saturday Which went like the guy was like all the panels sucked except for the anime match game.

740
00:50:24,627 --> 00:50:26,939
Speaker 0: Yes, something like that Along those lines.

741
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,790
Speaker 0: I'm very exaggerating a little bit.

742
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:35,270
Speaker 1: The sentiment was repeated in our own forums where someone basically said wow your guys run a kick-ass game show.

743
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:45,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, and when you actually look at the schedule for katsucon this year, you know, like I thought oh the programming's not light It's just a lot of the panels are uninteresting.

744
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:52,730
Speaker 0: Well, no actually on further examination There really aren't that many panels and most of them are uninteresting to most people.

745
00:50:52,850 --> 00:51:03,450
Speaker 1: Well when I got to the feedback session the bid I'd missed where apparently we were talked about Before that they had a little whiteboard up that showed like things that have already been brought up and apparently like that's really smart.

746
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,440
Speaker 0: That shows how smart katsucon is that they would think of something like that.

747
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:08,528
Speaker 1: Oh katsucon runs their feedback panel.

748
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:10,975
Speaker 1: So Professionally, it's really good.

749
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:16,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the con chair really knows how to deal with people who ask stupid questions and have stupid complain.

750
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,950
Speaker 0: I think I might go to it next year just for entertainment factor.

751
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:21,035
Speaker 1: yeah, it was really entertaining cuz.

752
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:34,776
Speaker 1: also people really had very few legitimate complaints and almost every complaint someone had was either answered immediately like well, we couldn't do that because of X or hey, that's a good idea or a Not to put it politely.

753
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:39,410
Speaker 1: they would say in a very polite way effectively your concern is stupid and you're a stupid person.

754
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,850
Speaker 0: You should feel stupid But then your complaint is bad and you should feel bad.

755
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,870
Speaker 1: But the thing is they didn't do it in it in a mean way.

756
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:52,632
Speaker 1: they did it in a very, you know, genteel way like well, we I had I acknowledge your concern and I Don't.

757
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:53,838
Speaker 1: we dealt with that thing.

758
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:55,989
Speaker 1: the way we would deal with it, you know, is that sort of answer?

759
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,570
Speaker 1: Yep, because some of the people were complaining about the dumbest things that you just couldn't give one dumb example.

760
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:05,204
Speaker 1: One guy was trying to complain about the elevator situation.

761
00:52:05,224 --> 00:52:06,389
Speaker 0: Oh, what are we gonna do?

762
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,700
Speaker 0: We're gonna install more elevators in the hotel.

763
00:52:09,841 --> 00:52:22,603
Speaker 1: one kid complained that the AMV Reshowing on Saturday was too early and he couldn't wake up early enough for it to which the con chair Basically said it was standing room only as it was.

764
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,090
Speaker 1: I don't think we missed any people.

765
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,255
Speaker 0: Hahaha, yeah, there was two.

766
00:52:27,296 --> 00:52:29,924
Speaker 0: they showed the AMV's twice once at 6 p.m.

767
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:31,489
Speaker 0: Friday and once at 9 a.m.

768
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:31,910
Speaker 0: Saturday.

769
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:40,930
Speaker 1: Yeah apparently 9 a.m was too early and the guy was trying to Stammer out his complaint that people wouldn't be able to get up and see it and it would be better served showing it at noon.

770
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:43,239
Speaker 1: And no it was standing room only.

771
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:46,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus at noon the cosplay rehearsal starts.

772
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,919
Speaker 0: They don't have time to do the anime music videos any early Hours to show.

773
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,490
Speaker 1: so this con was rocking at 7 in the morning.

774
00:52:53,832 --> 00:52:54,437
Speaker 0: That's another thing.

775
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:57,814
Speaker 0: that surprised me is we were there Thursday So we woke up Saturday.

776
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:58,717
Speaker 0: what Friday morning?

777
00:52:58,737 --> 00:53:03,450
Speaker 0: and the con started real early like as soon as people woke up Friday con started.

778
00:53:03,911 --> 00:53:10,555
Speaker 0: There was no programming at the con until noon and there was no real programming until 3 or 5.

779
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:12,049
Speaker 0: So it was like whoa.

780
00:53:12,871 --> 00:53:21,939
Speaker 0: There's a crazy con going on, but the only things actually happening are the 24/7 video game room The artists alley in the dealers room and such and such.

781
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,030
Speaker 1: now aside for our match game, which apparently went really really really well.

782
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,210
Speaker 1: I mean the people who were at it gave us a standing ovation and loved it.

783
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,089
Speaker 1: It was a full house.

784
00:53:30,432 --> 00:53:33,549
Speaker 1: In fact people came up and left because the room was full and they couldn't really get in.

785
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was in a pretty small room relative to some of the other panel rooms.

786
00:53:37,043 --> 00:53:38,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, but our panelists were great.

787
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:51,464
Speaker 1: we actually had an aunt from Apple geeks and I'd over fallen and Conrad from c-squared and Corbin the concierge of sitcom and Scott Johnson the old man Scott Johnson the old man that Corbin is Scott Johnson.

788
00:53:51,524 --> 00:53:58,450
Speaker 1: actually Scott Johnson is cool You know, we make fun of Scott Johnson But he's actually Scott Johnson is just our favorite friend to make fun of because it's too easy.

789
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:02,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he is pretty much part of the triad of us when we go to cons.

790
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:09,150
Speaker 1: Yep, but anyway Corbin and Scott Johnson were a little drunk on the panel, which was both hilarious and frustrating.

791
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:12,790
Speaker 1: It was hilarious because they were really funny at the panel most of the time.

792
00:54:13,373 --> 00:54:16,810
Speaker 1: It was also frustrating because us as hosts had to keep them in line drunk.

793
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:22,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was pretty difficult Like sometimes you just couldn't get them to write a real answer down like on one.

794
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:25,580
Speaker 1: Corbin drew the anal beads for the second time.

795
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:34,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, Corbin just drew some anal beads and it was like dude all right, we know the anal beads are awesome, but You don't draw them as an answer.

796
00:54:34,697 --> 00:54:35,159
Speaker 0: however,

797
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:56,264
Speaker 1: however, the funny thing was see me I don't want to have a big head here But I think it speaks to our skill at doing this because we've run this match game a lot of times Since our IT anime club, we've been running this match game and when he drew the anal beads the first time, you know, he drew it and shows it to the crowd and We pulled off this whole bit where we're like who?

798
00:54:56,384 --> 00:54:59,197
Speaker 1: first of all half the crowd goes What the hell is that?

799
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:00,744
Speaker 1: and the other half of the crowd goes?

800
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:07,221
Speaker 1: Ah To which we did this whole bit of who there knows what that represents.

801
00:55:07,522 --> 00:55:10,170
Speaker 1: you're all sick sick and awesome.

802
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:24,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then, you know, we're talking a little bit more and one guy in the crowd says you drew him wrong Proceeds to explain why he drew him wrong Which apparently the thing is drawing him wrong is the inside joke from our group.

803
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:27,021
Speaker 1: This guy either has the same inside joke or is a pervert.

804
00:55:27,202 --> 00:55:28,106
Speaker 0: I think he's a pervert.

805
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,250
Speaker 1: either way is cool though.

806
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,122
Speaker 0: Cuz the tone of voice.

807
00:55:31,143 --> 00:55:32,029
Speaker 0: I'm betting pervert.

808
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:37,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is pervert at an anime con is not nearly so bad as pervert in the street.

809
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:42,869
Speaker 0: well, it is bad, but because there's so many like them and they're expected that it's just like a.

810
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:45,938
Speaker 1: Now anime perverts don't bother me so much.

811
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:47,182
Speaker 1: They're not causing problems.

812
00:55:47,322 --> 00:55:50,030
Speaker 0: No, they're not causing problems, but I still not a fan.

813
00:55:50,494 --> 00:55:52,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can you can be not a fan.

814
00:55:52,451 --> 00:55:54,919
Speaker 1: I mean Daryl Surratt is not even a real pervert.

815
00:55:54,979 --> 00:55:57,909
Speaker 0: Like if I see a guy peeping Tom in the street, I just go.

816
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:02,590
Speaker 1: That's a little bit different that's actually going beyond the law.

817
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:05,082
Speaker 0: I know that but you see my point.

818
00:56:05,202 --> 00:56:06,870
Speaker 1: But anyway that that went really well.

819
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:21,522
Speaker 1: the other panels apparently they had a DS Pictionary game which went really well, I Heard tell from two sources that the how to draw a yuri panel was a half hour late and so Poorly executed.

820
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,372
Speaker 1: it was worthless Really?

821
00:56:23,392 --> 00:56:29,193
Speaker 0: I was you think that someone who was gonna teach everyone how to draw yuri would want to get to it and do a Good job.

822
00:56:29,313 --> 00:56:32,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, two different sources said that it was just this crap panel.

823
00:56:33,372 --> 00:56:35,628
Speaker 1: And yeah, I don't really have anything more to say about it.

824
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:42,316
Speaker 1: According to Scott Johnson and Corbin who went to the anime club summit It was god-awful and horribly run.

825
00:56:42,396 --> 00:56:50,140
Speaker 1: and because they're actually experts, you know Corbin runs an anime con and Scott Johnson Runs the club summit at Otakon every year.

826
00:56:50,160 --> 00:57:02,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he's now Otakon staff, you know Scott Johnson Scott and I ran the biggest anime club in the country for years on end Yep, so they went to it and they basically ran this panel from what they told us.

827
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:08,212
Speaker 1: I didn't go to it from the audience and hopefully they'll actually run this panel next year because I Believe.

828
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:11,129
Speaker 1: I talked last year about how lame this club summit panel was too.

829
00:57:12,072 --> 00:57:12,353
Speaker 1: I don't know.

830
00:57:12,393 --> 00:57:12,875
Speaker 1: katsu kan.

831
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:17,250
Speaker 1: just the panels could be so much better and I don't know why they're not good.

832
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:20,019
Speaker 1: Many people complained about many of the panels.

833
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:23,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really know what you could do to make the panels better.

834
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,710
Speaker 0: I mean they had plenty of guests who could have had made good panels.

835
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:31,350
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure there were diamonds in the rough and good panels, but I didn't hear anything about him.

836
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:32,561
Speaker 0: So and I didn't go to him.

837
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:33,469
Speaker 0: So what do we know?

838
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:46,400
Speaker 0: Yeah I the only and even with even the fact that I didn't go to any of them meant that None of the titles or description of the panels interested me enough that I would leave Playing Dig Dug to go to them.

839
00:57:46,822 --> 00:57:48,469
Speaker 0: your panels had to be better than Dig Dug.

840
00:57:48,509 --> 00:57:53,730
Speaker 1: people See I would have left Dig Dug to go to a few of them but past the Dig Dug before I could get to the panel.

841
00:57:55,133 --> 00:57:57,029
Speaker 1: Now root beer tappers would always stop me.

842
00:57:57,492 --> 00:58:01,670
Speaker 1: I walked out of the video game room at one point with the intention of doing something.

843
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:08,407
Speaker 1: I forget what I think was going to the bathroom or something And then I saw root beer tapper was open and then an hour later.

844
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:10,173
Speaker 1: I Forgot.

845
00:58:10,193 --> 00:58:10,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

846
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:12,687
Speaker 0: Oh the bathrooms at katsu kana real nice.

847
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:14,837
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I'll talk about this briefly.

848
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:22,967
Speaker 1: the hotel that katsu kan is in the Omni showroom in DC is Super fancy far more fancy than an anime con needs or deserves.

849
00:58:23,088 --> 00:58:23,630
Speaker 1: It is great.

850
00:58:24,173 --> 00:58:26,750
Speaker 0: Oh that reminds me this one other thing they do that's really nice.

851
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:29,661
Speaker 0: They have a special katsu kana room service.

852
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:30,725
Speaker 0: where for like.

853
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:31,850
Speaker 0: was it four dollars?

854
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,810
Speaker 1: I have something bad to say about that but go on you can bring like a hamburger to your room.

855
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:39,681
Speaker 0: The room service will come without paying the exorbitant room service fee.

856
00:58:40,002 --> 00:58:45,678
Speaker 1: according to what everyone I have asked has said The that food was god-awful.

857
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:49,710
Speaker 0: Oh, I could expect that for four dollars, you know and someone bring you to your room.

858
00:58:49,771 --> 00:58:50,667
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get much.

859
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:55,026
Speaker 0: But at least they did something instead of just having room service.

860
00:58:55,066 --> 00:58:57,659
Speaker 0: that's normal price Which is twelve dollars.

861
00:58:57,699 --> 00:58:59,550
Speaker 0: for breakfast that should be six dollars.

862
00:58:59,550 --> 00:58:59,639
Speaker 1: Yeah.

863
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:13,009
Speaker 1: They also very smartly closed down for lunch and dinner the restaurant in the hotel Which is ludicrously overpriced and I had no anime fans can afford that even though last year We ate at it just because we didn't want to go outside in the cold and it wasn't.

864
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,570
Speaker 0: yeah If it was like a storm, I would totally pay the money to eat at it.

865
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,924
Speaker 0: I looked at the menu and it was just like $25 for a steak.

866
00:59:20,984 --> 00:59:23,897
Speaker 0: that should be $17 and I was like, uh, no.

867
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:27,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they shut it down in order to make more space for people to hang out.

868
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:28,753
Speaker 0: That's cool.

869
00:59:28,954 --> 00:59:31,382
Speaker 1: Yeah, unfortunately people didn't realize they could hang out there's.

870
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:32,045
Speaker 1: they avoided it.

871
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:32,386
Speaker 1: So they'll.

872
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:33,530
Speaker 0: yeah, I never went down there.

873
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:34,435
Speaker 0: I didn't realize I could.

874
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,310
Speaker 1: yeah, there's actually even outside of the restaurant.

875
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:42,590
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of couches and seating down there and there was pretty much DS action down there every time I walk by awesome.

876
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:48,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, there wasn't as much DS action at this con as previous cons But I think that's just because everyone was being so social.

877
00:59:48,345 --> 00:59:58,630
Speaker 1: there was no time And there was a DS hangout area in the game room that we didn't really go by but I think that needed to be more Clearly labeled as a DS hangout area.

878
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:08,206
Speaker 1: I think what I'm gonna do next year is I'm gonna run a bunch of Bomberman Download play tournaments and Tetris download play tournament and Diddy Kong.

879
01:00:08,266 --> 01:00:09,210
Speaker 0: I'm gonna run some Diddy Kong.

880
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:13,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna run mad tournaments next year now that we know exactly the situation.

881
01:00:13,953 --> 01:00:16,549
Speaker 1: Yep, and of course after the tournament ran went so well.

882
01:00:17,493 --> 01:00:19,078
Speaker 1: But yeah panels kind of mad.

883
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:25,368
Speaker 1: from what I've heard and maybe from what I've heard from friends I trust but not from what I've seen I can't say more about it.

884
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:28,359
Speaker 1: We are going to try to run more panels at this con next year.

885
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:31,970
Speaker 0: Oh one other thing the registration line.

886
01:00:32,191 --> 01:00:40,590
Speaker 0: I don't know what was going on because I didn't have to wait in it But it seemed like people were waiting to register like well past noon on Saturday.

887
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,943
Speaker 1: Part of that was because a lot of people show up for the one day at Katsucon.

888
01:00:43,983 --> 01:00:46,935
Speaker 1: on Saturday or the two-day a Lot of people show up late.

889
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:49,607
Speaker 1: I'll show people checking into their hotel on Saturday morning.

890
01:00:49,948 --> 01:00:54,550
Speaker 1: Wow Katsucon is a con where a lot of people show up early and a lot of people show up late.

891
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:57,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't get your badge until like 2 p.m.

892
01:00:57,547 --> 01:00:58,130
Speaker 0: On Saturday.

893
01:00:59,131 --> 01:01:02,822
Speaker 0: If you plan on going to sleep Saturday night, there's really no point in coming.

894
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:10,230
Speaker 1: Hey, but you came way too late, man Yeah, I don't worry about that anymore because I pretty much show up to cons earlier and earlier.

895
01:01:10,692 --> 01:01:16,250
Speaker 1: I mean we show up at Otakon Thursday at like noon and we leave Sunday at like 5 or 6.

896
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,510
Speaker 1: Katsucon we got there around 3 o'clock on Thursday.

897
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,592
Speaker 1: Yeah

898
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:42,860
Speaker 0: Oh one other thing I want to point out that Katsucon did that other cons should do is they put a piece of paper in the con bag that had the names phone numbers prices locations and such of all nearby restaurants banks dry cleaners the CVS and Important info about the metro but not the entire metro schedule.

899
01:01:43,442 --> 01:01:50,470
Speaker 0: other cons kind of put this information in there Like maybe they'll have some names of some nearby restaurants and reviews of them or something.

900
01:01:51,031 --> 01:01:57,852
Speaker 0: But they don't put down the phone numbers and whether or not they deliver or whether or not they have an ATM there or stuff Like that.

901
01:01:58,374 --> 01:02:00,362
Speaker 0: like Otakon will have like $1 sign $2 sign $3 sign.

902
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:03,878
Speaker 0: How about this?

903
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:06,290
Speaker 0: one says four to five dollars or?

904
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:09,798
Speaker 0: Sixteen to seventeen dollars or six to seventeen dollars.

905
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,604
Speaker 0: That's the useful information right there.

906
01:02:11,744 --> 01:02:11,945
Speaker 1: Yep.

907
01:02:12,647 --> 01:02:13,850
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're kind of going along.

908
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:16,690
Speaker 1: So I guess wrap this up in the con in general.

909
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:19,690
Speaker 1: I mean they moved all the furniture out of the main lobby, which was great.

910
01:02:19,851 --> 01:02:23,930
Speaker 1: It gave him so much more space people to walk around and it prevented anime fans for breaking anything.

911
01:02:24,412 --> 01:02:26,057
Speaker 1: They did this awesome thing where they taped.

912
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:32,861
Speaker 1: they taped off the hallways all the main hallways on the sides With basically sitting areas so people could just kind of sit and hang out.

913
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think also part of that was for line waiting.

914
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:55,680
Speaker 0: So if a line ever needed to be made anywhere They could have the people wait near behind the tape and people could still walk around Which definitely worked because when I was walking around near the incredibly long Registration line or main events line wherever it happened to be at the time I don't even know I never had a problem walking by as someone not who is not waiting in the line.

915
01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:03,990
Speaker 1: Yep, we went to the rave on Saturday night and it was four or five times better than Otakon's rave easily hands-down.

916
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:09,930
Speaker 0: Well, I think the reason is because number one Otakon has the rave in that hallway and that small room next to the hallway.

917
01:03:10,392 --> 01:03:11,797
Speaker 0: This rave was in main events.

918
01:03:11,897 --> 01:03:13,563
Speaker 0: It took up the entirety of main events.

919
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,330
Speaker 0: It was one big giant rave.

920
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:17,338
Speaker 0: They had excellent sound equipment.

921
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:18,503
Speaker 0: They had excellent lighting.

922
01:03:18,865 --> 01:03:20,130
Speaker 0: They had excellent everything.

923
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:24,270
Speaker 0: The in and out of the rave was excellent, you know with a whole bunch of doors.

924
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:32,639
Speaker 0: The DJ while he might not have been playing the best music in the world was good Satisfactory I guess I mean I want.

925
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,070
Speaker 1: I wish there would have been some happy hardcore or something.

926
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what they were playing when he weren't in there.

927
01:03:37,643 --> 01:03:45,352
Speaker 1: I mean we were only in there for an hour Yeah, but last year they played a but there was some OC remixes and more video game music two years ago was awesome Awesome.

928
01:03:45,472 --> 01:03:47,238
Speaker 1: Awesome where they had 80s night on Friday.

929
01:03:47,259 --> 01:03:49,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, who knows what they were playing at the Times?

930
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:50,530
Speaker 0: You weren't in there.

931
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:56,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, when we were in there, it was standard rave music Not the greatest DJ in the while I'd say standard rave music.

932
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,550
Speaker 1: Otakon standard rave music is pretty much just a thumping bass.

933
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,450
Speaker 0: Well, I think that also has to do with the room.

934
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:13,066
Speaker 1: It makes it sound a lot worse than it is now because the the DJs at Otakon them in their live mix and these generally Just tend to play this very very minimalist techno and I hate minimalist techno.

935
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, also The only other thing is that there were.

936
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,456
Speaker 0: the rave was full of people tons of people But there was plenty of room to dance.

937
01:04:21,476 --> 01:04:26,854
Speaker 0: you weren't like squished in and you also weren't too spaced out that it felt like you Were dancing alone.

938
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:27,236
Speaker 1: Yep.

939
01:04:27,336 --> 01:04:33,590
Speaker 1: There was very little circle and there were like two circles But they were kind of a and they kept getting broken up by real people dancing.

940
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:38,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there were lots of people dancing everywhere as opposed to people standing and looking around.

941
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:42,201
Speaker 0: There was also way too much glow stick going on and blinky.

942
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,264
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

943
01:04:43,605 --> 01:04:45,170
Speaker 1: No one was being obnoxious with.

944
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:45,994
Speaker 0: No, it was.

945
01:04:46,235 --> 01:04:57,429
Speaker 0: there was only one guy who sweat swung him around, you know Most people kept them in their own personal space and they didn't have my long Ten foot strings swinging them around hitting people in the head or anything like that.

946
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:00,800
Speaker 1: I mean overall and every year katsu khan always proves me right.

947
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,648
Speaker 1: katsu khan has the best con dances and every con.

948
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:09,970
Speaker 1: if You're not gonna do the crazy awesome ideas that we want at least emulate what katsu khan does because they do it.

949
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:15,090
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean free and Otakon doesn't use their main events when the rave is going on, right?

950
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:21,920
Speaker 0: So other than the fact that there are a bunch of chairs in there They could have a rave up there maybe instead of where they have it.

951
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:22,422
Speaker 0: I don't know.

952
01:05:22,784 --> 01:05:25,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's already there a DJ We just had to set up on stage.

953
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:32,370
Speaker 1: Also, there's the fact that katsu khan's dance for various reasons always smells horrible and katsu khan's dance didn't smell at all.

954
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,795
Speaker 0: Otakon's dance smells horrible.

955
01:05:33,895 --> 01:05:35,522
Speaker 1: Otakon's dance smells worse than you said.

956
01:05:35,662 --> 01:05:36,887
Speaker 0: you said katsu khan's dance.

957
01:05:37,027 --> 01:05:37,750
Speaker 1: Oh, I meant Otakon.

958
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:46,830
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I think that has to do with the fact that it's in one big Well-ventilated room as opposed to a cramped hallway and then a cramped room.

959
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:51,870
Speaker 1: But I mean in general there was despite the horrible crampedness in the hallways of katsu khan.

960
01:05:52,272 --> 01:05:53,763
Speaker 0: I meant in Otakon.

961
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,091
Speaker 1: I'm just talking about in general There's.

962
01:05:55,171 --> 01:06:01,857
Speaker 1: there was almost no smell at katsu khan and except for that one gamer that one guy and they go one or two guys Who must have stuck up that game room?

963
01:06:02,139 --> 01:06:06,779
Speaker 1: Yep, and there was also a Surprising lack of morbidly obese people.

964
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:10,110
Speaker 0: I mean there was a couple fat people, you know here and there.

965
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:19,970
Speaker 0: But usually you go to a con and you see a few people that are just holy crap fat and you see like a group Of people that are big fat comic book guy nerds katsu khan not so much really.

966
01:06:20,152 --> 01:06:31,666
Speaker 1: I remember last year katsu khan There was this really really really fat dude trying to get it squeezed into this elevator and he couldn't fit in because the elevators are Actually pretty small at the door and like kids kept running around him getting in the elevators.

967
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:32,268
Speaker 1: We couldn't get in.

968
01:06:33,433 --> 01:06:34,416
Speaker 1: He was getting really mad.

969
01:06:34,697 --> 01:06:38,310
Speaker 1: So we tried to take the stairs, but the stairs are way too narrow for him to even fit.

970
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:38,872
Speaker 1: Yeah,

971
01:06:39,072 --> 01:06:54,703
Speaker 0: I also I kind of wish that we weren't on the eighth floor because you do have to wait for the elevators if you Want to use them at a busy time and a lot of people they get on the elevator if they want to go down while The elevator is going up making it far less efficient than it could be.

972
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:59,430
Speaker 0: but because everyone does it You also have to do it or else you won't get on the elevator.

973
01:06:59,671 --> 01:07:06,070
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna get our rooms for next year toot suite and I'm going to specifically request a suite on the second floor.

974
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:10,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we get a low enough room, I have no problem taking the stairs all the time, which would be awesome.

975
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:11,635
Speaker 1: No last year.

976
01:07:11,716 --> 01:07:12,583
Speaker 1: We were on the second floor.

977
01:07:12,684 --> 01:07:13,490
Speaker 1: It was so awesome.

978
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:17,970
Speaker 1: I wore my pajamas down to watch the pond the third strange psychokinetic strategy.

979
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:27,629
Speaker 0: Yep one other thing is that I did go down the stairs once from the eighth floor to the L floor and It actually took a lot less time and was a lot less painful than I thought it would be.

980
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,970
Speaker 0: However, the stairways are really really narrow and it was very narrow.

981
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:31,813
Speaker 0: Players don't fit.

982
01:07:32,073 --> 01:07:37,250
Speaker 0: someone behind me was carrying nothing and I was carrying a bunch of bags and they would have passed me.

983
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:38,205
Speaker 0: So I had to kind of run.

984
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,403
Speaker 1: So of course in closing katsu khan was super badass.

985
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:44,250
Speaker 1: It's as always one of my favorite cons.

986
01:07:44,391 --> 01:07:46,382
Speaker 1: We will definitely be returning every year.

987
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:46,765
Speaker 1: Yep.

988
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:49,370
Speaker 0: There's no way I'm not going to katsu khan next year.

989
01:07:49,451 --> 01:08:03,930
Speaker 1: If you are anywhere near Washington DC You should also go to katsu khan and we're on the staff mailing list for the game katsu the gaming room and I gotta say It is so heartening to me that right now they're already planning what to do better next year.

990
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,690
Speaker 1: There's and not just like hey, we should do this, but they're getting on Skype.

991
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:11,690
Speaker 1: They're already coming up with concrete plans for how to make katsu khan better next year.

992
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:18,075
Speaker 0: Well, if you're gonna have a good con you need to plan this shit full gear in advance or else That's how this stuff works.

993
01:08:18,497 --> 01:08:20,063
Speaker 0: So they're definitely on top of it.

994
01:08:20,323 --> 01:08:22,069
Speaker 0: That's something I definitely noticed about katsu khan.

995
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:37,737
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's because I can see more of the under workings than I can at other cons like Otakon But it definitely seems like the staff is all intelligent hard-working and they care and they try as Opposed to other cons where that isn't.

996
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:40,910
Speaker 0: that might may or may not be true, but it's not always evident.

997
