1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,507
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, February the 9th.

2
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:12,770
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:13,813
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,022
Speaker 0: And this is... some weeknights.

5
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:22,760
Speaker 0: Tonight, the long-awaited, much-delayed-as-all-book-clubs-will-be book club!

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,243
Speaker 0: With two books.

7
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:26,746
Speaker 0: I think I already said double.

8
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:33,880
Speaker 0: The Little Prince, and also Wind, Sand, and Stars, both written by Antoine Dessin Exupéry.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,406
Speaker 0: Oh.

10
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:37,793
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

11
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:41,579
Speaker 1: I thought you didn't like the long-open-y.

12
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:44,979
Speaker 0: That's why I was trying to torture you with the long-open-y.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,688
Speaker 1: It doesn't bother me.

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:46,219
Speaker 1: I think it's fine.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,539
Speaker 0: I want to see if you know how it feels.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,704
Speaker 1: You know what?

17
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:50,669
Speaker 1: There's no trouble with it.

18
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:51,312
Speaker 1: It's fine.

19
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:52,800
Speaker 1: Mighty fine.

20
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:54,240
Speaker 0: Uh, great.

21
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:54,840
Speaker 1: Yeah?

22
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:57,280
Speaker 0: Okay.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,770
Speaker 1: I guess we should just get right into this in traditional book club fashion.

24
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,519
Speaker 1: We're gonna skip the news and all that crap because, uh...

25
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,111
Speaker 0: Well, we got two books.

26
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:05,880
Speaker 0: We need more time.

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,740
Speaker 1: We also want these episodes to be relatively timeless since the book club is theoretically separate from Geek Nights.

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,799
Speaker 1: In some fashion or other.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,749
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

30
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:16,720
Speaker 0: Whatever.

31
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,450
Speaker 1: But first, things of the day!

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,850
Speaker 0: So at work, we were discussing, you know, talking about stuff randomly, you know, stuff.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,666
Speaker 0: And Candlepin Bowling came up.

34
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:35,490
Speaker 0: Some co-workers had not heard of it.

35
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,490
Speaker 1: I know a thing or two about that.

36
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did it once.

37
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:39,497
Speaker 1: Twice.

38
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:40,329
Speaker 1: We played two games.

39
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:40,732
Speaker 0: Sure.

40
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,349
Speaker 0: Well, actually, no, we played two strings.

41
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:45,513
Speaker 0: Aw, shit, son.

42
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I know that.

43
00:01:46,776 --> 00:01:52,010
Speaker 0: It's because, apparently, another co-worker thought to do some YouTube search for Candlepin Bowling.

44
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,645
Speaker 0: And he found this video entitled "Candlepin Bowling - Paul Berger's Legendary 500

45
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:56,866
Speaker 0: Triple.".

46
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,450
Speaker 0: Legendary?

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,352
Speaker 0: Legendary.

48
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:03,370
Speaker 0: So I did some bunch of research, and apparently, I learned a whole bunch of shit.

49
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,050
Speaker 0: Because that's what happens when you research things.

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:05,490
Speaker 0: Apparently.

51
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:09,229
Speaker 0: Candlepin Bowling, would you believe, was on television.

52
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,392
Speaker 0: Broadcasted between the late 50s and as late as 2006.

53
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:21,110
Speaker 0: There was still, 2009 even, there was a Candlepin Challenge show that was on Comcast Sportsnet New England.

54
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,250
Speaker 0: As late as 2009, Candlepin Bowling was on television.

55
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,830
Speaker 0: But the most important Candlepin Polling television program was simply called Candlepin Bowling.

56
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:40,990
Speaker 0: It was on these local Channel 5, and it was broadcast between the years of 1958 and 1996.

57
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,310
Speaker 0: And it was pretty much the Candlepin Bowling show.

58
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,570
Speaker 0: And it was just on in Boston area, you know, for all those years.

59
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,350
Speaker 1: It's really sad that I had more fun Candlepin Bowling than I did with the arcade at Fun Spot.

60
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,290
Speaker 0: Anyway, so there was a guy named Paul Berger, and he was just sort of a Candlepin Bowling guy.

61
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,190
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's not a super professional thing.

62
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,509
Speaker 0: He was also like a sales something at Sun Microsystems or something like that.

63
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,900
Speaker 0: You know, but he Candlepinned Bowling.

64
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,466
Speaker 0: It was his thing.

65
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,233
Speaker 0: And he was on this show.

66
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:12,390
Speaker 0: He was actually on this show as early as, his first appearance on the show was in 1976.

67
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:20,131
Speaker 0: But this video is from his, I think, 43rd appearance on the show in the year of 1992.

68
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:27,310
Speaker 0: And in the year of 1992, in his 43rd appearance, he played a match against the defending champion, Dave Richards.

69
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,450
Speaker 0: Now, I learned what the terminology means.

70
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,990
Speaker 0: And basically, when they do a Duckpin, a Candlepin Bowling competition, the rules are slightly different from real bowling.

71
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,209
Speaker 0: Like, you get extra bonus balls to roll and stuff like that.

72
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:50,287
Speaker 0: And they have some sort of system for prize money, where it's like, you know, if you get a mark, which is a spare or a strike, and you get another mark, every mark in a row that you get gets you like a $50 bonus.

73
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,777
Speaker 0: And then winning gets you a bonus.

74
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,749
Speaker 0: Alright, so there's a money thing going on too.

75
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:58,837
Speaker 0: But basically, what you get is you get a triple.

76
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:03,270
Speaker 0: You play three full games, three strings, right, which is ten frames each.

77
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:08,770
Speaker 0: And, you know, your three scores combined into one big score is your triple.

78
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:09,611
Speaker 0: Right?

79
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:14,750
Speaker 0: So like a high 300 triple, so like, you know, close to 400 is really fucking good.

80
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:17,399
Speaker 0: Low 400s is amazing, right?

81
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,648
Speaker 0: So this guy got a 500 triple.

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:28,088
Speaker 0: Playing three full games in a row, his total score was exactly 500, which was a record for this show of all time.

83
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:40,249
Speaker 0: Like, he beat the previous high score of like 480 or 90-something, which beat the previous high score of like 460-something, which had been the highest score for the longest time.

84
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:49,253
Speaker 0: So, this is just some dude's candlepin balling, and you see the champion sort of fails, and, you know, the challenger, he gets.

85
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:52,488
Speaker 0: like so many strikes in a row, it's just like, "Holy shit, are you kidding

86
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:52,608
Speaker 0: me?".

87
00:04:53,551 --> 00:05:06,520
Speaker 1: It's kind of like in that old game, One Must Fall 2097, how the narrator, you know, the news person afterward would say something like, "That was a fair fight," and whatever, but if you trounced the other guy, it'd be like, "If you wanted to see a fair fight,

88
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:07,747
Speaker 0: well, you were out of

89
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:08,089
Speaker 0: luck.".

90
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,950
Speaker 1: If you like a masochistic orgy of violence.

91
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,050
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to part one, but it's on YouTube, so you gotta go through parts two, three, four, five.

92
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:23,850
Speaker 0: You can pretty much just watch parts one, four, and five, 'cause that's where he gets most of the strikes in a row, is four and five.

93
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,229
Speaker 0: But he's already got a substantial lead by the time four starts.

94
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,390
Speaker 1: So interesting, because I am also linking to a part one of something.

95
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,410
Speaker 1: So there was a documentary that I did not know about, or if I did, I'd forgotten, called simply Cold War.

96
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,350
Speaker 1: It aired in the '90s on CNN, and there's a whole history of Ted Turner and all these people funded it.

97
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:44,130
Speaker 1: It was narrated by, of all people, Kenneth Branagh.

98
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:47,063
Speaker 1: It was a pretty... I was watching some of it.

99
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,410
Speaker 1: It's a pretty great documentary.

100
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:59,210
Speaker 1: Now, apparently, it was on TV from CNN in '98, and recently, like in 2009, the website that had about it disappeared.

101
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,510
Speaker 1: And it was never released on any format other than, I think there was one VHS release.

102
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,602
Speaker 1: Like, in 1999, and that was it.

103
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,630
Speaker 1: It's never been re-aired anywhere, as far as I can tell.

104
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,889
Speaker 1: It's kind of one of those lost things.

105
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,341
Speaker 1: There are many people who claim that it was never re-released because the government, the U.S.

106
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:22,970
Speaker 1: government, reclassified information in three of the episodes that had previously been declassified.

107
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,869
Speaker 1: However, I can't actually find a legitimate source saying that.

108
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,889
Speaker 1: I find a lot of semi-legitimate sources.

109
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,559
Speaker 0: Well, wouldn't that source be classified?

110
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,130
Speaker 0: so it would be like you couldn't find it?

111
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,670
Speaker 1: It's complicated, but I'm dubious of it actually being classified because I found the entirety of it on YouTube.

112
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:43,429
Speaker 1: So, I'm linking to episode one, Comrades.

113
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:52,310
Speaker 1: It is 24 episodes, each of which covers an aspect of the Cold War, and the 24 together cover the entire Cold War.

114
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:00,230
Speaker 1: And there are apparently interviews straight up with, like, premiers of the Soviet Union and Russia and, like, Castro and crazy stuff in here.

115
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,647
Speaker 0: Okay, so, the finally, the book club you may or may not have been waiting for.

116
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:06,370
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

117
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,850
Speaker 0: So, before we talk about these two books, right, I want to discuss the person who is fun to pronounce his name.

118
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,308
Speaker 1: Antoine de Saint-Luc Petit.

119
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:15,410
Speaker 0: Oh, what an awesome name.

120
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,260
Speaker 0: This dude, people don't really know much about this dude.

121
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,349
Speaker 0: I mean, people who know about him know about him.

122
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,074
Speaker 0: But most people don't pay attention.

123
00:07:22,114 --> 00:07:28,390
Speaker 0: Like, they might know The Little Prince is a great book, but they never look into, you know, the person who wrote it or any of the other books he wrote.

124
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,790
Speaker 0: Which is why I chose to do Double Book Club, also because The Little Prince is really short.

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,210
Speaker 0: But before I want to highlight this dude, right, Antoine.

126
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,641
Speaker 0: So, what is so awesome about Antoine?

127
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:39,150
Speaker 0: You know, he's just some author, right?

128
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,072
Speaker 0: Well, no.

129
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:45,030
Speaker 0: Actually, Antoine was basically a real live Porco Rosso.

130
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:56,230
Speaker 0: He was, like, you have this imagination and, you know, in your imagination in movies you see, like, these, you know, fantastic, you know, adventurous figures like Indiana Jones or whatever, right?

131
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,157
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, those aren't real.

132
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,826
Speaker 0: There's no one actually, yeah, there actually was a dude like that.

133
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:01,890
Speaker 0: It was this dude.

134
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,563
Speaker 0: Like, his life, you know, is like, you read it and you're like, yeah, that's just some adventure book.

135
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,428
Speaker 0: There was no one actually like, no, there was.

136
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,090
Speaker 0: It was this dude.

137
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:12,096
Speaker 0: He's the awesomest dude there ever was.

138
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,970
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, no one is, like, some perfect saint or anything like that.

139
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I have some criticisms of some of the sentiment in Wind, Sand, and Stars toward the end.

140
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:24,670
Speaker 1: He's a little patronizing toward the lower classes, but I digress.

141
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,491
Speaker 0: And ladies.

142
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:31,642
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that, you know, the dude's life was still amazing.

143
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:36,570
Speaker 0: You know, he flew the Aeropostale, you know, he wrote all these awesome books.

144
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,369
Speaker 1: How do you fly a T-shirt?

145
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not funny at all.

146
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,950
Speaker 1: I think it was funny.

147
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,532
Speaker 0: You know, he went down.

148
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:44,837
Speaker 0: I guess the way he went down was sort of lame.

149
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:51,310
Speaker 0: It's like, he, you know, he probably shouldn't have flown, but he demanded they let him fly a mission and he flew the mission and he supposedly got shot down.

150
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:56,569
Speaker 0: And this debate as to who actually shot him down and stuff like that, you know, but it's like...

151
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,870
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's fitting to the legend of Krauser.

152
00:08:59,357 --> 00:08:59,610
Speaker 0: Exactly.

153
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:07,269
Speaker 1: It's the kind of end that you, like, that'd be like the movie end to this guy's life and the fact that that was also the actual end to his life was...

154
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,878
Speaker 0: But it's like, who do you know, you know, these days?

155
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:13,230
Speaker 0: Like, look for anyone that you can point to in history that was, like, so...

156
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,289
Speaker 1: To whom the phrase "a living legend" applies?

157
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,047
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I mean, there are people who are, you know, way more awesome in general, right?

158
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,650
Speaker 0: Like, you know... Norman Borlaug?

159
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, this dude is not as awesome as George Washington, right?

160
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,250
Speaker 0: George Washington is more awesome, right?

161
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:37,390
Speaker 0: But in terms of the story of his life being equivalent to an adventurous work of fiction, I don't think you can find a person who is more, you know, fitting that description.

162
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:44,229
Speaker 0: So you should read his Wikipedia and such to learn about his awesomeness because it's just as awesome as reading a book.

163
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,941
Speaker 0: And it's a really long and awesome Wikipedia page.

164
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:50,168
Speaker 0: He's got photos of him and all kinds of cool stuff.

165
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:50,750
Speaker 0: All right.

166
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:52,689
Speaker 0: So, The Little Prince.

167
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,573
Speaker 0: The Little Prince.

168
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,630
Speaker 0: So, before we talk about The Little Prince, I want to talk about translations, right?

169
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,610
Speaker 0: Antoine de Saint-Ejouperi, if you did not guess, is a French.

170
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,258
Speaker 0: I will make fun of you like Glass Joe.

171
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,008
Speaker 0: Only because it is okay and you do not care.

172
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:06,470
Speaker 0: All right.

173
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,806
Speaker 1: Il ne parle pas français.

174
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:11,024
Speaker 0: Okay, so I read this book.

175
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,230
Speaker 0: Actually, I'll tell you a story.

176
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,585
Speaker 0: So when I was little, someone bought me this book and I have the book right here and the cover price is $3.95, which is awesome.

177
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:20,576
Speaker 0: $3.95, if only, right?

178
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:31,190
Speaker 0: And, you know, they gave it to me and I just didn't read it because it was some little tiny book that had weird little pictures in it and I didn't really care about it.

179
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,578
Speaker 0: And it sort of sat on the shelf and I ignored it.

180
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,050
Speaker 0: And then I read it and it was the awesomest book.

181
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,740
Speaker 0: I was like maybe eight, nine, ten, something like that.

182
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,630
Speaker 0: I think I got it when I was like six, seven, eight, something like that, whatever.

183
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:43,894
Speaker 0: And it was the awesomest book.

184
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,079
Speaker 0: But it's fallen apart.

185
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,162
Speaker 0: It's not doing too well.

186
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,950
Speaker 0: Even though I still have all the pages here, it's not doing too well.

187
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,430
Speaker 0: So, when I had to reread it for the book club, I bought the new edition.

188
00:10:54,631 --> 00:11:00,790
Speaker 0: And I realized that, you know, this is originally written in French, obviously, and it's been translated into maybe a zillion languages.

189
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:05,750
Speaker 0: I'd be willing to bet that the only book translated into more different languages than this is maybe the Bible.

190
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,175
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much it.

191
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:08,986
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's true.

192
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:09,610
Speaker 0: I'm just betting on that.

193
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,130
Speaker 1: Well, it's worth noting that this book is probably one of the better known books if you count the entire population of the world.

194
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:16,911
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:22,350
Speaker 0: I mean, you go to any bookstore in any country, you'll be able to find this book in the native language, no problem.

196
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,870
Speaker 0: Dude, when Emily and I were in Japan... Well, in Japan, it's even more popular.

197
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but just in Hakone, kind of like off in the middle of, like, just in our travels, we happen to see a Little Prince Museum just kind of set up.

198
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,818
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, they love him even more there.

199
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:39,810
Speaker 0: It's a special, you know, so... But anyway, so the new edition that I bought, right, has color illustrations.

200
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,930
Speaker 0: Apparently, they were originally in color, and the one I had as a kid was black and white, was not, you know, wasn't the real deal.

201
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,930
Speaker 0: They're both published by HBJ, Harcourt, Brace, whatever.

202
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:56,570
Speaker 0: But the translations are way different, and I just want to read from, like, the first page so you can see the difference here, right?

203
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,790
Speaker 0: So the translation I had as a kid was done by, translated from the French by Catherine Woods, right?

204
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,809
Speaker 0: So let's read, like, the first couple paragraphs here.

205
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,350
Speaker 0: "Once when I was six years old, I saw a magnificent picture in a book called True Stories from Nature about the primeval forest.

206
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:15,543
Speaker 0: It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.

207
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,446
Speaker 0: Here is a copy of the

208
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:16,828
Speaker 0: drawing.".

209
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,648
Speaker 0: Right, and this other one here is translated from the French by Richard Howard, so it's a different translation.

210
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:24,049
Speaker 0: Let's see.

211
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:33,347
Speaker 0: "Once when I was six, I saw a magnificent picture in a book about the jungle, as opposed to the primeval forest, right, called True

212
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:33,869
Speaker 0: Stories.".

213
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,164
Speaker 0: And see, so my original one said "called True Stories from Nature,".

214
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:38,189
Speaker 0: the new one says "called True

215
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:38,430
Speaker 0: Stories.".

216
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,759
Speaker 0: "It showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild beast.

217
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:44,487
Speaker 0: Here is a copy of the

218
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:44,808
Speaker 0: picture.".

219
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,105
Speaker 0: So picture, drawing, boa constrictor, wild beast, right?

220
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:49,747
Speaker 0: In general...

221
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,649
Speaker 1: Wild beast or wildebeest?

222
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,536
Speaker 0: Wildebeest.

223
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:52,779
Speaker 0: Right?

224
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,401
Speaker 0: You know, there are some significantly different words going on here.

225
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,306
Speaker 0: Jungle, primeval forest, right?

226
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:02,750
Speaker 0: That's pretty different right there.

227
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:16,259
Speaker 0: And I noticed just the older translation, it seemed like it was, you know, not that I have the French to compare it to, or no French to even do it, but it felt like a more literal kind of translation, right?

228
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:24,390
Speaker 0: You know, it's like primeval forest sounds like the kind of thing that you translated, you know, that in French it must be the word for forest, and then an adjective.

229
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,844
Speaker 1: Yes, in French it is "sur la forête

230
00:13:26,985 --> 00:13:27,529
Speaker 1: vierge.".

231
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:28,818
Speaker 0: Right, that's how you say jungle?

232
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,370
Speaker 0: Like they don't have a jungle word.

233
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,510
Speaker 1: I don't speak French that well.

234
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,228
Speaker 0: Like they don't have a word, it seems like, it's just like, you know, just knowing...

235
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:40,648
Speaker 1: "Once when I was six, I saw a magnificent picture in a book about the forest, as opposed to the primeval

236
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:40,969
Speaker 1: forest.".

237
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:41,993
Speaker 0: That's enough.

238
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:45,210
Speaker 0: But the point is, that's the kind of feeling you get just knowing languages, right?

239
00:13:45,230 --> 00:14:12,010
Speaker 0: It's just like, oh, that language probably doesn't have a word for jungle, they probably just have an adjective forest, and that's what, you know... But anyway, and I think that actually, you know, part of it of course is the age at which I read it, because I didn't reread the old copy, but I definitely got a different feeling reading it now than reading the old one, and I think that was definitely at least partially due to translation, and of course mostly due to age and life experience.

240
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,050
Speaker 1: So, primeval is actually a better translation, because this really translates to, if you go literally, virgin forest.

241
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:21,050
Speaker 0: Ah, alrighty then.

242
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,210
Speaker 1: Primeval forest is, I think, a better translation of that than jungle.

243
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,910
Speaker 0: But anyway, both by the same publisher, different editions, different translations.

244
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,372
Speaker 0: I should warn

245
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:46,681
Speaker 1: you all too, because I'd read the book when I was young, but I wanted to buy it again just to read it, and while it's readable online for free in a number of different places, in fact I'll link to a place that has the pictures and the translations Scott read first, but I bought just the cheapest copy on Amazon without really looking,

246
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:47,322
Speaker 0: and

247
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:53,950
Speaker 1: it was totally this ghetto, print-on-demand bullshit, with a crappy translation and crappy pictures.

248
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,040
Speaker 0: So it wasn't even just a bootleg that photocopied and ripped off those good translations, it was just a...

249
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:08,470
Speaker 1: And the drawings were like pixelated, blown-up garbage, in black and white.

250
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:09,270
Speaker 0: Oh, that's awful.

251
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,350
Speaker 1: I was really mad about that, but I paid like, 90 cents for it?

252
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,483
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like I said, this old printing that I had as a kid was $3.95 cover price, this new one, $10 cover price.

253
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,930
Speaker 1: Oh Scott, with inflation, that's like $1,000.

254
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,290
Speaker 0: Well I mean, color pictures too, I mean, you're paying for something.

255
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:26,010
Speaker 0: And supposedly worse translations, so whatever.

256
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,569
Speaker 0: So let's talk about the actual book.

257
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,429
Speaker 1: So Scott, do you want to start with what it was about, or what we liked?

258
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:33,430
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, basically what it was about is pretty simple.

259
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:39,230
Speaker 0: This guy's in the desert, he's a pilot, he finds a little prince in the desert, he talks to the little prince.

260
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,230
Speaker 1: Well, he's crashed in the desert, possibly prepared to die of thirst if he can't fix his plane.

261
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:43,704
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,046
Speaker 1: And the little prince shows up and says,

263
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:45,188
Speaker 1: "Hey.".

264
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,750
Speaker 0: Little prince shows up and he spends the whole book talking to the little prince, and then the end.

265
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:50,350
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the whole book.

266
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,950
Speaker 1: So, what was the book about?

267
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:54,630
Speaker 0: The book is pretty much about...

268
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,490
Speaker 1: I want to see, because I'll point out, I've never read any sort of analysis of the little prince.

269
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:10,970
Speaker 0: No, I mean, this is mostly one of those books that's like, it's a book for children, it's accessible at a young age, it'll be in the kids' section of the bookstore, but it's something anyone can read.

270
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,789
Speaker 0: And what it's about, obviously...

271
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,330
Speaker 1: I'm mostly curious if you got the same thing out of it that I did.

272
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:24,550
Speaker 0: No, is that kids, anyone who is young, does not have these preconceived notions of the world, and can see the truth, and knows what's really important.

273
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:27,190
Speaker 0: And as you get older, you get dumb.

274
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:34,581
Speaker 0: And it shows all the different ways, as the little prince talks about all the different planets he stopped at on his journey, and every planet he learned about.

275
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:41,150
Speaker 0: a way adults are stupid, and a way adults don't understand what's important in life anymore.

276
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:49,270
Speaker 0: He's got the planet with the drunk, and the planet with... Yeah, the planet with the guy who's just lighting the lamp all the time, and turning it off.

277
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,829
Speaker 0: A planet with a guy who's studying, right?

278
00:16:52,252 --> 00:17:03,090
Speaker 0: And it shows how all these adults have found something in life that they do, that's so important, and they forgot what's really important, which is that you should worry about whether the sheep has eaten the flower yet or not.

279
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,089
Speaker 1: What do you mean by the sheep eating the flower?

280
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,470
Speaker 1: Because I think that it's a little more subtle, that really, if I had to say what this book is about, I'd just simply say it's about imagination.

281
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:19,890
Speaker 1: Children have this kind of simple clarity of vision magnified by their imagination that many adults just don't have anymore.

282
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:27,290
Speaker 1: Look at the very beginning, the lump that he draws, the hat, and how, to a child, that's clearly a boa constrictor having eaten an elephant.

283
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:27,989
Speaker 0: That's true.

284
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:35,370
Speaker 1: And how he makes this point that adults can't see these very simple things because they either lack imagination or they lack perspective.

285
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,929
Speaker 0: Yes, but the imagination perspective is just the tool that children have that allows them...

286
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,530
Speaker 1: No, because think about the story of the little prince.

287
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:53,310
Speaker 1: The only reason this adult really was able to meet the little prince, it was born of his imagination because in crashing his plane, he was cut off from the world.

288
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,090
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't think he actually found the little prince in the desert?

289
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,010
Speaker 1: No, there was no little prince.

290
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,607
Speaker 0: You don't think so?

291
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:57,608
Speaker 0: I think there was.

292
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,669
Speaker 1: Especially after having now read "Wind, Sand, and Stars," he makes a big point there, not to get into that book, about...

293
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,690
Speaker 0: He does say the word "little prince" in that book when he was crashing the desert.

294
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,590
Speaker 1: About how there's certain...

295
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:08,226
Speaker 0: I'll try to find it.

296
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:22,909
Speaker 1: ...modes of thought or certain ways of being and thinking and existing and experiencing that it is almost impossible to achieve unless you're cut off from, I guess, the normal routine of life, for some reason or other, or if you are on the verge of death.

297
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:34,030
Speaker 1: And I think that this story is about a man who is cut off from the world and is forced to be introspective and come to terms with the fact that he might not survive.

298
00:18:34,451 --> 00:18:41,550
Speaker 1: And as a result, he imagines this wonderful tale of all the kind of things that distract people like him in the real world.

299
00:18:42,032 --> 00:19:06,130
Speaker 1: and how here, when he's cut off from all that, he has this sort of clarity of vision that is otherwise inaccessible to him, and the prince dies because he is now free to return to his real life, and there is no way he will fully maintain the memory of the prince, but he has this kind of hope that what memory of the prince he has... He jolts himself out of his mundane life by remembering the prince when he is reminded of the prince by seeing the moon or seeing the stars.

300
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,384
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

301
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,877
Speaker 1: That is my interpretation.

302
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:11,590
Speaker 1: I think it's a little more subtle than what you were implying.

303
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:22,148
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's just the kind of thing that when I read this book as a kid, right, at least my memory of reading it as a kid is completely different.

304
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,396
Speaker 0: Like, "Really?

305
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,146
Speaker 0: That's what this book

306
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:24,389
Speaker 0: was?".

307
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,066
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Yeah, I remember part of it being

308
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:26,268
Speaker 0: this.".

309
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:28,830
Speaker 0: When I was young, I remember-- I remember the end being completely different.

310
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,074
Speaker 1: The only memory I had of it was I remember it being incredibly sad to me, and I didn't-- It was.

311
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,789
Speaker 0: I also remember it being the saddest.

312
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,010
Speaker 1: I did not remember anything else about it other than that it was very sad.

313
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:43,869
Speaker 0: I remembered the boa constrictor and the different planets and that it was very sad at the end.

314
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,902
Speaker 1: I know I read it before.

315
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:45,490
Speaker 1: I read The Hobbit.

316
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,293
Speaker 1: That's about as close as I can peg it in my life, and I'm pretty sure-- I don't know.

317
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,845
Speaker 0: I might have read The Reverse Order.

318
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:51,410
Speaker 0: I don't even know it.

319
00:19:51,430 --> 00:20:03,150
Speaker 1: It was at least before I was in fifth grade because I was definitely still living in Detroit when I read it, and I remember vaguely what house I was living in, so it had to have been first, second, or third grade.

320
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:07,802
Speaker 0: I remember all the illustrations, too, at least in black and white, so seeing them in color was like, "Oh, they had colors.

321
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:08,426
Speaker 0: He had

322
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:08,929
Speaker 0: watercolor.".

323
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:09,133
Speaker 0: I do.

324
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,569
Speaker 0: They existed.

325
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,030
Speaker 1: I think the illustrations are terribly charming.

326
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,099
Speaker 1: I think my--

327
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:29,530
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if you go to-- The thing is I put Little Prince as something in my Facebook profile, the book I like in the book section, so I guess that automatically made me like the Little Prince, which makes me automatically follow the official Little Prince Facebook page, even though I didn't explicitly do that.

328
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:30,350
Speaker 1: Ah, Facebook.

329
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,130
Speaker 0: So now if you go to my Facebook-- If I go to Facebook, I see all these official postings, and pretty much all it is is buy our merchandise, buy our merchandise.

330
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,450
Speaker 0: Somebody is manufacturing all this merchandise all the time.

331
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,450
Speaker 0: It's almost as much as Hello Kitty.

332
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,610
Speaker 0: I don't want to say it's as much as Hello Kitty because nothing is that much.

333
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,470
Speaker 0: It's like they make everything with the Little Prince illustrations on it.

334
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,670
Speaker 0: It's like you can buy a wristwatch with elephants on it.

335
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:51,410
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

336
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:57,970
Speaker 1: I think of all of it, my favorite illustration, however, is the bit, and I pulled it up here, just so I could look at it again, of the Turkish astronomer.

337
00:20:58,816 --> 00:20:59,450
Speaker 0: Oh, you like that one?

338
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,570
Speaker 1: Who kind of looked like a clown.

339
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,289
Speaker 1: I know no one listened to him because he kind of looked like a clown.

340
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've always liked the Baobabs with the three trees on the planet.

341
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:08,927
Speaker 0: That's always a good one.

342
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:12,268
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

343
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:26,150
Speaker 1: Now, there's another kind of secondary point here, that the book's about imagination, in my opinion, but while what you were saying, that children have this kind of clarity of vision and directness that adults often don't have, coupled with imagination.

344
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,290
Speaker 1: I mean, look at the Little Prince.

345
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:31,210
Speaker 1: If you ask the question, he never relents until the question is answered.

346
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, why?

347
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:32,279
Speaker 0: Why?

348
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,350
Speaker 1: Yep, because that's how children are.

349
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,033
Speaker 0: But it's strange.

350
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:40,970
Speaker 0: how, like, how did this real-life Antoine de Saint-Eupery, how did he know the mind of a child so well, right?

351
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,690
Speaker 0: Well, he makes that point.

352
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:46,310
Speaker 0: It's so strange in that we all know the mind of a child.

353
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,238
Speaker 0: No, we don't.

354
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,309
Speaker 1: There are people who do.

355
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,470
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like if we read this book, right, we know, we're like, ah, that's the way I thought when I was a kid.

356
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:56,789
Speaker 0: I know kid ways of thinking, and that's the way I see kids thinking, right?

357
00:21:57,392 --> 00:22:02,149
Speaker 0: But, at the same time, we're still adults and we still do the stupid adult shit.

358
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,442
Speaker 0: Ah, because it's very difficult.

359
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:05,510
Speaker 1: Look at the moral of this.

360
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:11,750
Speaker 1: The protagonist was only able to meet the prince because he was cut off from all that bullshit.

361
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:19,429
Speaker 1: And the only reason he can even hold onto that memory is because he's kind of jolted back into it by this memory, by very specific things.

362
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,550
Speaker 1: But there's a secondary part.

363
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:29,690
Speaker 1: You know, the children are kind of better in this regard, but he also makes a big point about how the naivety of children is very dangerous.

364
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,729
Speaker 1: I mean, the little prince in the story could not understand the rose, the kind of adult world.

365
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:39,910
Speaker 1: So neither world can understand the other without these extraordinary circumstances.

366
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:47,550
Speaker 1: The protagonist understood the issue with the rose for the prince immediately, but the prince couldn't.

367
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:59,390
Speaker 0: The other thing I like about the book, right, is it's one of those ones where you get this big overall message and everything fits into it nicely, but in each chapter, it also sort of stands alone as its own separate message.

368
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,269
Speaker 1: A little parable of life, like, "Don't be the businessman who owns the stars, but that means

369
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:03,550
Speaker 1: nothing.".

370
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:11,590
Speaker 0: Or like the planet where it spins around so fast, you see sunsets and sunrises all the time, like every few minutes, you know, or like the drunkard.

371
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,390
Speaker 0: It's like you learn a lesson about something.

372
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:17,070
Speaker 0: He's got all these separate messages all the time for every little different thing.

373
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:20,930
Speaker 0: So it's like, as you read it, you're like building and building a pond.

374
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,165
Speaker 0: It's like each individual lesson is a puzzle piece.

375
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:29,424
Speaker 0: in the greater picture, even though the book is only, what, like 100 pages, not even 83 pages?

376
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,171
Speaker 0: Yeah.

377
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:33,230
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, this took me a few days to read.

378
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:37,330
Speaker 0: Nowadays, when I read it for the book club, it took me two hours.

379
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,770
Speaker 1: I have little deeper analysis.

380
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,640
Speaker 0: I mean, there's only 83 pages.

381
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,930
Speaker 0: I mean, how much analysis are you going to do?

382
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:47,070
Speaker 0: It's one of the most read books ever, if you want the deepest analysis.

383
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, I think I summed up my feelings pretty succinctly.

384
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,509
Speaker 1: The only thing I could add is that I think every human being in the world should read this book.

385
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, multiple times in your life, if necessary.

386
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,050
Speaker 1: If possible, you must read it as a child and as an adult, because maybe it's a zebra storyteller situation.

387
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:18,370
Speaker 1: I mean, having read this book again as an adult, I've caught myself a few times already, you know, getting like immersed in some work thing or some Geek Nights thing or some Kineticon thing and kind of stopping and thinking about the little prince and then stopping what I was doing and kind of, you know, entering that world for a second.

388
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, and since it only takes two hours, it's like you can just do it.

389
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:26,610
Speaker 0: It's not like a major investment, so like it's almost like you just need to recharge, you know.

390
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,268
Speaker 1: Your child laser.

391
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, the child laser, the child brain laser.

392
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:36,525
Speaker 0: So you just reread the book every, you know, year or two or so, you know, to get that to be like, "Oh, right, that's what's important about

393
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:36,868
Speaker 0: living.".

394
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,190
Speaker 1: I mean, think about the subtle point at the end.

395
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,349
Speaker 1: How does he remember the prince?

396
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:47,769
Speaker 1: Primarily, he wonders what happened to the prince because while the story was imaginative, he doesn't know the ending.

397
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,770
Speaker 1: So you could almost argue that by knowing the fullness of the ending, there's no more room for imagination.

398
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,150
Speaker 1: And therefore, there's no catalyst to remember.

399
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:58,148
Speaker 1: Yep.

400
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,230
Speaker 0: All right, let's talk about Wind, Sand, and Stars, which is much larger and will take much more time to discuss.

401
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,070
Speaker 1: This is the first book in a long time where I reread chapters simply because they were so beautiful to read.

402
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:09,081
Speaker 1: The writing is amazing.

403
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:11,269
Speaker 0: I didn't reread chapters.

404
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,629
Speaker 1: Well, I reread the section where he flew through the typhoon.

405
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:22,050
Speaker 0: But there were like, series of paragraphs that were just so much epicness that I would reread them like ten times, right?

406
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,464
Speaker 0: And it's just like, "Oh my god, what paragraph did I just read?

407
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:26,167
Speaker 0: I must read that

408
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:26,509
Speaker 0: again.".

409
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,050
Speaker 0: And it's like, I should have bookmarked them, but I failed.

410
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,570
Speaker 1: His writing is very direct, and he takes tangents, but they're very stream of consciousness tangents.

411
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,010
Speaker 1: Like, he'll go in all these different directions, and then it always kind of links back together, and it always has this kind of driving theme.

412
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,770
Speaker 1: And I like how the dialogue when he's with someone is interjected.

413
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:46,970
Speaker 1: The writing is just fantastic.

414
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:49,050
Speaker 1: I have very little bad to say about it.

415
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,664
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, the writing, it's translated from French.

416
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:52,910
Speaker 0: This isn't even the real writing.

417
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,389
Speaker 1: That is the strength, how well it holds up.

418
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:57,589
Speaker 0: All right, so who did this translation here on this one?

419
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,610
Speaker 1: My translation was...

420
00:25:59,371 --> 00:25:59,908
Speaker 0: Luis Galantier.

421
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:01,370
Speaker 1: I have the same translation.

422
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should get Luis Galantier to do Little Prince, is what we should do.

423
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:05,010
Speaker 0: Anyway.

424
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,790
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this book is, it's weird, it's not a fiction.

425
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,650
Speaker 0: This is an autobiographical work, but it's like, you wouldn't know.

426
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,070
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you would, because all these things sort of happen to him, and he's talking about real people that he knew.

427
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:22,588
Speaker 0: But it's not written like an autobiography, like, "Here is the story of my

428
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:22,890
Speaker 0: life.".

429
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:32,889
Speaker 0: It's written like, "Here are some stories of my life, and I will tell you those stories, you know, almost like Grandpa telling you about the time, or not, whatever, when I did the

430
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:33,150
Speaker 0: thing.".

431
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,250
Speaker 0: But he's not just telling you the story the way Grandpa is.

432
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:45,030
Speaker 0: He's actually trying to tell you something else, and just using those stories as examples and vehicles for teaching you the thing he wants to teach you in that particular chapter.

433
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,170
Speaker 1: This is almost less an autobiography than it is an essay.

434
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:49,694
Speaker 0: Yeah.

435
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,265
Speaker 1: Because he has a strong thesis.

436
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,010
Speaker 0: And all his supporting evidence is his own life.

437
00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:07,340
Speaker 1: But notice how his thesis is very well-constructed, in that when he was confronted with death, when he almost died in the desert of thirst after having crashed, most people who write about this book kind of talk about how.

438
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,730
Speaker 1: that's what the book is about, like, that is the story.

439
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:16,710
Speaker 1: And yet, he can't tell that story until he sets up all of these other pieces of the argument.

440
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,470
Speaker 1: Like, if you just read that part of the story by itself, it would almost mean nothing.

441
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:33,490
Speaker 1: But having already read all of his descriptions of what it's like to fly, and why he flies, and why people fly, and all these kind of... It sets the stage for that, and that kind of is the first point where he makes his real argument.

442
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:40,570
Speaker 1: And then he follows that with the Spanish Civil War, and that's just, like, further evidence.

443
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,130
Speaker 1: Like, he's exploring that thesis and trying to, like, understand why the world is the way it is.

444
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:54,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what I thought was really interesting, at least the part that hit me the most, was, like, I wasn't sure what the overall message of the whole book was, right?

445
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,209
Speaker 0: Because it just starts off with, you know, the craft, and then, you know, the tools, and whatever, all the chapters, right?

446
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:13,450
Speaker 0: But early on, the part that, like, I reread at least ten times, was, like, these few paragraphs, which I can't find, because I didn't bookmark anything because I'm a moron, was where he talked about how, like, look, you know, was flying the mail really such serious business?

447
00:28:13,851 --> 00:28:16,499
Speaker 0: Did we really care about getting the mail there, right?

448
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,208
Speaker 0: It's like, no, we didn't really care about getting the mail there.

449
00:28:19,268 --> 00:28:19,970
Speaker 0: that much, right?

450
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,494
Speaker 0: Why did we follow these orders?

451
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:26,730
Speaker 0: Why do we care so much that the orders were followed and, you know, everything was taken so seriously, right?

452
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,600
Speaker 0: Did we really care about following orders?

453
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,570
Speaker 0: No, we didn't really care about following orders.

454
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:35,310
Speaker 1: Well, notice how bookended and paralleled that is in the end when he's talking about the war.

455
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,314
Speaker 0: Well, that's what I'm saying, right?

456
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:39,930
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, and then he's like, well, why did we do it then?

457
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:48,310
Speaker 0: Why did we, you know, risk life and limb and do all these things to follow the orders and get the mail delivered if we didn't actually care about the mails, right?

458
00:28:48,831 --> 00:29:01,230
Speaker 0: And the reason is because by doing those things, by following the orders and delivering the mails, you know, a person who does those things will be turned into a certain kind of person, right?

459
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:11,689
Speaker 0: And it's all about, you know, these things are what creates this kind of human being, and he shows you all these examples of that kind of human being, including himself, and you're just like, damn.

460
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,290
Speaker 0: That's a fucking human being right there.

461
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:30,850
Speaker 1: When he's talking about the partisans who are gonna go, you know, they're acting a certain way, and there's this certain, like, very profound camaraderie and bravado, but then when they're actually given the order, you're going to go fight and probably die, then they change a hundred percent.

462
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,074
Speaker 1: And it's clear that it's the same.

463
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:36,246
Speaker 1: They don't actually want to die and fight at the moment.

464
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:37,810
Speaker 1: They do it anyway.

465
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:43,959
Speaker 1: But he kind of argues that war like that, a good comes out of it.

466
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:48,385
Speaker 1: That kind of camaraderie can only be drawn from certain kinds of experiences.

467
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,470
Speaker 1: That kind of warfare is one of those experiences.

468
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,935
Speaker 1: He's not arguing that that warfare is good.

469
00:29:54,216 --> 00:29:56,721
Speaker 1: He's just saying that that is a result of warfare.

470
00:29:57,082 --> 00:30:00,650
Speaker 1: Maybe we need to find more ways to instill that without killing each other.

471
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,149
Speaker 1: Or risking our lives.

472
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean, if you read, the final chapter is conclusion.

473
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:09,605
Speaker 0: And he pretty much comes right out and says, there's no bush beating here.

474
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:11,790
Speaker 0: There's no, you'd have to literally be illiterate.

475
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,000
Speaker 0: But yet, to not, because he says it straight up.

476
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,890
Speaker 0: He's like, here are the final pages of the book, blah, blah.

477
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:23,379
Speaker 0: You know, as he served as escort, we, those clerks were needed of the same stuff as the rest of us, but they knew not that they were hungry.

478
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:31,750
Speaker 0: To come to man's estate is not necessary to get oneself killed round Madrid or to fly mail planes or to struggle wearily in the snows out of respect for the dignity of life.

479
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:39,690
Speaker 0: The man who can see the miraculous in a poem, who can take pure joy from music, who can break his bread with comrades, opens his window to the same refreshing wind off the sea.

480
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,756
Speaker 0: He too learns a language of men, but too many men are left unawakened.

481
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:49,244
Speaker 0: And the final sentence of the book is only the spirit, if it breathe upon the clay can create man.

482
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:52,389
Speaker 0: It's like, these are the things that make a man what he is, right?

483
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,235
Speaker 0: You know, flying a plane through a horrible Thai food.

484
00:30:56,255 --> 00:31:01,003
Speaker 0: And you know, this experience, you know, a man is clay and these experiences mold that man.

485
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:04,930
Speaker 0: And this is the kind of man that, you know, this kind of experience makes that kind of man.

486
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,433
Speaker 0: And you don't have to be a pilot.

487
00:31:06,794 --> 00:31:14,670
Speaker 0: You know, you could be a computer programmer or a nerd or a guy who really likes hentai or a swimmer or whatever it is that you do.

488
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:20,210
Speaker 0: But if you do it in a certain way, then it will craft you into a real man.

489
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,070
Speaker 1: Now, he makes many others.

490
00:31:22,512 --> 00:31:22,990
Speaker 0: Who's awakened.

491
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,536
Speaker 1: In the course of his argument, he makes many other interesting points.

492
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:30,830
Speaker 1: And I think the most profound one that I kind of want to talk about is the idea of what horror is.

493
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,870
Speaker 1: And he says very clearly, I forget the exact words, that horror is kind of a construction after the event.

494
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,970
Speaker 1: There is no such thing as horror in the moment.

495
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,530
Speaker 1: Horror comes afterward when you reflect on what happened.

496
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:48,349
Speaker 1: You know, he goes at great lengths to explain what it was like to fly through that typhoon.

497
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:54,410
Speaker 1: And yet he also goes to great lengths to explain that it is impossible to truly explain the experience.

498
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:04,290
Speaker 1: Because he almost has to exaggerate it because the mere facts of the events don't underscore what it truly feels like.

499
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:12,070
Speaker 1: But yet, at no point in these death-defying moments is a person truly afraid or truly horrified.

500
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,190
Speaker 1: It's only afterward when they reflect upon how close they came to death.

501
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:19,130
Speaker 1: It's like men will walk stoically into death and are only afraid of it after they've survived.

502
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,910
Speaker 0: Well, like the totally awesome dude who crashed in the snow in Chile and then walked through the snow.

503
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,010
Speaker 1: But notice that the man survived.

504
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,690
Speaker 0: Was that Giyome, I think, did that, right?

505
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:34,947
Speaker 1: He had the will to survive, and yet what he said about the experience was, "What I went through is something I would suffer no animal to

506
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:35,568
Speaker 1: experience.".

507
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,802
Speaker 1: But he went through it anyway.

508
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:40,070
Speaker 1: The horror came after the fact.

509
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:44,890
Speaker 0: And even while the book covers horror, it also covers the exact opposite.

510
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,910
Speaker 0: One of my favorite parts was when he's in, I think, Argentina.

511
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,890
Speaker 0: And he's just in this house with the people who live in the woods.

512
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,630
Speaker 0: With the two girls, right?

513
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,810
Speaker 0: And the way he described this house with the snakes, it was like a house that was really tight.

514
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:03,750
Speaker 0: But everything was sort of natural and quaint, but in its place.

515
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:06,810
Speaker 0: And the house had a creaky floor.

516
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:16,386
Speaker 0: It's like when you just think back to when you were a kid, crawling in tiny hidey holes and tree houses out back and that sort of thing.

517
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:23,930
Speaker 1: He made an interesting secondary point there, too, about those two girls were so full of vigor and spirit.

518
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,609
Speaker 1: And he kind of laments, "Oh, they'll probably marry someone stupid and become

519
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:27,810
Speaker 1: boring.".

520
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:28,571
Speaker 0: Yep.

521
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:32,030
Speaker 0: But it's like they lived in just this awesome place.

522
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:39,030
Speaker 0: And at that time, in that moment, in that place, there were all these awesome things in this totally awesome house.

523
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,770
Speaker 0: I don't have a word besides awesome.

524
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,358
Speaker 0: But it's just like, I absolutely 100% felt like I was in that place.

525
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,450
Speaker 0: And I wanted to live there, in that house.

526
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,650
Speaker 1: This is one of the more beautiful books I've ever read.

527
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:54,170
Speaker 1: I cannot recommend it enough.

528
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,930
Speaker 1: Actually, I was surprised that our friend Phil hadn't read it yet.

529
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:58,349
Speaker 1: I'm going to make sure he reads it.

530
00:33:58,632 --> 00:34:00,969
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, every human being should read it.

531
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,810
Speaker 0: It's going to be available in your language.

532
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,530
Speaker 0: Maybe not as many as Little Prince, but enough.

533
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:14,230
Speaker 1: These two books in a pair are a very profound pair because they have very similar messages and they complement each other to a great degree.

534
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,047
Speaker 0: Well, it's the same dude.

535
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,350
Speaker 0: Crash Landing in the Desert.

536
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,409
Speaker 0: The word Little Prince does appear in When Sand and Stars in a Spot.

537
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:31,489
Speaker 1: I also enjoyed a lot of the little stories, like the bit about the British fort that was attacked by the one group of local Moors or Arab Muslim, his general.

538
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,650
Speaker 1: The racism of the era shines through and I tried to overlook it because it was the era.

539
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:40,889
Speaker 0: There wasn't any overt sexism, but he's always... It was there.

540
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,219
Speaker 0: It's all about men.

541
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,750
Speaker 0: He doesn't talk about ladies.

542
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:49,250
Speaker 1: He seems to imply that many women become dulled by their choice of mate.

543
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:54,730
Speaker 1: I tried to overlook anything that is clearly a product of its time.

544
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,150
Speaker 0: The dude was alive between 1900 and 1944.

545
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,530
Speaker 1: But I love that story where the one tribe attacks the British fort in the desert while one of the other tribes happened to be having a parlay over tea.

546
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,950
Speaker 1: And the other tribe fought against the tribe with the British.

547
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:15,210
Speaker 1: And then when it was that tribe's turn to attack the fort, because once again he talks a lot about honor, misplaced honor.

548
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,270
Speaker 0: That's a lot of the kind of thing that will happen in medieval times, right?

549
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,290
Speaker 0: It's like, I hate you, but you're a guest in my castle, so I can't kill you.

550
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:35,890
Speaker 1: But how the people coming to attack the fort the next day first send an emissary asking for the ammunition they spent defending the British to be returned to them so that they could then attack the British and how the British commander complied.

551
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:42,598
Speaker 1: That is ludicrous from every possible perspective except from this weird misplaced sense of honor.

552
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:52,530
Speaker 1: and how that sense of honor is one of the kind of results of this kind of warfare, which in the end is a good thing, except for the fact that you need warfare to get it.

553
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,170
Speaker 0: Right, he's not like, well killing people is not good, right?

554
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:01,122
Speaker 0: But, you know, this sense of honor, these sorts of behaviors, following these policies creates a certain kind of man.

555
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:15,809
Speaker 1: Imagine a world where that conversation happened and then the tribe that asked for it and the general who agreed to it decided not to fight anymore because of that moment.

556
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:16,610
Speaker 1: Things like that.

557
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:22,330
Speaker 0: Another great one, the part that I love the second most, was with the slave guy.

558
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:23,210
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

559
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:31,850
Speaker 0: He goes to the fort and there's a slave there, but the slave doesn't use his original name anymore because he's a slave now.

560
00:36:32,393 --> 00:36:34,830
Speaker 0: And he finally is able to free this slave.

561
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,069
Speaker 1: He tried so hard.

562
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,956
Speaker 0: And he tried so hard to free the slave and the slave didn't really get it.

563
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:41,238
Speaker 0: He didn't really get it.

564
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,901
Speaker 0: And then he finally got it.

565
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:46,506
Speaker 0: And then he used his real name again and it was like, "Aw shit, son.

566
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:47,588
Speaker 1: Shit.".

567
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:58,490
Speaker 1: The only real issue I take with some of his arguments is that I see where he's coming from and I see why he came to these conclusions.

568
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:01,168
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if you live the life of an adventurer, right?

569
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,491
Speaker 1: But he won.

570
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:07,717
Speaker 1: His view of the poor is incredibly patronizing.

571
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:17,008
Speaker 1: I mean, when he talks about how the utter destitute find peace in their simplitude of their life like livestock.

572
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,150
Speaker 1: Really, dude?

573
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,724
Speaker 1: But I can understand the way he describes seeing them and seeing their lives compared to his own.

574
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,030
Speaker 1: I understand why he felt that way.

575
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:29,744
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's easy for people who are, you know, upper middle class.

576
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:31,210
Speaker 1: He came from a fairly wealthy family.

577
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:32,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, dude was not poor.

578
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,053
Speaker 1: Yeah, could feel that way.

579
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:41,570
Speaker 1: I disagree with his patronizing view and I disagree with a lot of the kind of assumptions he makes about the nature of the poor.

580
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:46,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I wonder if I was an adventuring guy in those days, would I not feel the same way?

581
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,431
Speaker 1: That's it.

582
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:50,930
Speaker 1: I cannot fault him for his view given what I expect his perspective was.

583
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,875
Speaker 0: So he was born in 1900, right?

584
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:58,390
Speaker 0: If he had not been, you know, tried to guess, you know, did he really try to kill himself sort of indirectly, right?

585
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,219
Speaker 0: He demanded he be sent on a mission when he probably shouldn't have been, right?

586
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,142
Speaker 0: He would be 112.

587
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:04,550
Speaker 0: So he'd probably be dead today.

588
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:09,182
Speaker 0: But if he was alive in, say, 1990, where he would be 90 or even in the 80s, right?

589
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:12,010
Speaker 0: What would he have thought then in the 80s, this guy?

590
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,668
Speaker 0: You know, if he was 80 something then, you know, I don't know.

591
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:27,470
Speaker 0: Anyway, the other part, you know, the part that I, a paragraph I actually found that I read a thousand times, right, was when he talks about the guy, the Bedouin who saved him from the desert, right?

592
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:34,950
Speaker 0: And he's like, "You, Bedouin of Libya, who saved our lives, though you will dwell forever in my memory, yet I shall never be able to recapture your features.

593
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,667
Speaker 0: Your humanity and your face comes into my mind simply as man

594
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:39,150
Speaker 0: incarnate.".

595
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,850
Speaker 1: That was a beautiful section.

596
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:48,509
Speaker 0: "You, our beloved fellow man, do not know who we might be, and yet you recognize us without fail, and I in turn shall recognize you in the faces of all

597
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:48,790
Speaker 0: mankind.".

598
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:59,130
Speaker 1: He bolsters that in the part about war where he points out the, and you know, we've seen outside of this book, we've seen this in real world with like the Christmas armistice in World War I,

599
00:38:59,750 --> 00:38:59,890
Speaker 0: but

600
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:09,770
Speaker 1: how the soldiers on both sides had understandings, like they would fight and try to kill each other, but at the same time they would sort of, like they would help each other.

601
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:19,190
Speaker 1: There's this kind of, he almost argues that the most common base thing of humanity is that humans in the end try to help other humans unless other bullshit gets in their way.

602
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:26,463
Speaker 0: He's like, "You came towards me in an Oriole of charity and magnanimity bearing the gift of water.

603
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:30,350
Speaker 0: All my friends and all my enemies marched towards me in your person.

604
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:37,008
Speaker 0: It did not seem to me that you were rescuing me, rather did it seem that you were forgiving me, and I felt I had no enemy left in all the

605
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:37,349
Speaker 0: world.".

606
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,221
Speaker 0: He's just looking at humanity as like all people are all people, right?

607
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,003
Speaker 0: You're a Bedouin?

608
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:47,510
Speaker 0: I don't care, which is weird when he's pissing on poor people and such.

609
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,435
Speaker 0: Well, because he's not pissing on them.

610
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:52,963
Speaker 1: He's oversimplifying their sentiment and their plight.

611
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:53,966
Speaker 1: He's patronizing.

612
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:55,630
Speaker 1: I'm not saying he didn't hate the poor.

613
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:57,369
Speaker 0: He wasn't a modern Republican.

614
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,659
Speaker 0: No, he doesn't seem to hate anybody, really.

615
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,690
Speaker 0: At least not anyone who's a human being, right?

616
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:06,176
Speaker 0: But it's like, he just finds brotherhood in all people.

617
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:16,730
Speaker 0: Even though he wants people to be these awakened men who have lived their lives in a certain way to have their eyes opened and to experience life and to know what's important.

618
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,449
Speaker 0: That sheep eating roses is the important thing to pay attention to, right?

619
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:27,542
Speaker 0: It's like he still finds brotherhood even in some guy he can't even talk to.

620
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,630
Speaker 0: that just came to him and gave him some water, you know?

621
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,196
Speaker 0: And in that person, he sees all the people of the world.

622
00:40:33,336 --> 00:40:34,519
Speaker 0: Everyone on the whole street.

623
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,486
Speaker 0: Even the lady on the train yesterday who I was trying to help.

624
00:40:37,806 --> 00:40:39,390
Speaker 0: She didn't know how to use the yellow bird and angry birds.

625
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,070
Speaker 1: Scott, those are the funniest two tweets I've read in my entire life.

626
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:49,563
Speaker 0: Is the same as this Bedouin guy, you know, who will rescue you when you're dying in the desert with his water, you know?

627
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:52,930
Speaker 0: All people are worthwhile and awesome people.

628
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,616
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, what are people?

629
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:56,201
Speaker 1: but just an extension of the Earth?

630
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:57,366
Speaker 1: You know, the Earth's people.

631
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:58,329
Speaker 1: And here we are.

632
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,155
Speaker 1: These are beautiful books.

633
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,509
Speaker 1: If you listen to this and you hadn't read them yet, you should read them.

634
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:06,639
Speaker 0: You should read any book.

635
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,746
Speaker 0: that's a book club book.

636
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:08,350
Speaker 0: That's the point.

637
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:11,669
Speaker 1: If you know someone who hasn't read either of these books, lend them to them.

638
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,598
Speaker 0: Or buy them.

639
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:15,530
Speaker 0: And don't buy the cheapest one on Amazon.

640
00:41:16,353 --> 00:41:17,869
Speaker 1: Do a little due diligence there.

641
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:24,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is one of those situations where it's like, OK, you want to pirate books or something like that for your Kindles or e-readers or audiobooks.

642
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:26,170
Speaker 0: It's like, no, dude, seriously?

643
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:33,090
Speaker 0: You know, and it's like the translations are different depending on whatever, you know, whatever country you're from, you're going to find a translation in the language you want.

644
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,309
Speaker 0: Make sure you get the good one, whatever the good one may be.

645
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:39,660
Speaker 0: For whatever they're charging.

646
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:40,850
Speaker 0: It's not going to be more than 10 bucks.

647
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,506
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

648
