1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,759
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, May 3rd, 2017.

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,982
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:15,589
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,980
Speaker 0: tonight We got a double feature.

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:24,208
Speaker 0: We're talking about two comics dissolving classroom and wrecked hearts.

6
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:26,887
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:29,198
Speaker 0: So speaking of wrecked hearts.

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:37,517
Speaker 0: I was looking pretty tough for the Rangers It's still tough before last night out of out of four games true But we lost the first.

9
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:44,746
Speaker 1: imagine if we play four games of anything Yeah, and you have to win three of them, and if you don't win three you actually lose.

10
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:51,079
Speaker 1: even so if I just win two Then that's it, but you have to win three.

11
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,890
Speaker 1: yeah, that's not good for you and no matter what game.

12
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:55,160
Speaker 0: I want to be fair.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,233
Speaker 1: even if we're playing coin toss It's not good for you.

14
00:00:57,313 --> 00:01:02,070
Speaker 0: game one against the Senators for the Rangers was pretty close and the Rangers doing okay like they just lost.

15
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:08,130
Speaker 0: And then game two was like crazy scoring double overtime bullshit, and it was a real close game.

16
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:24,050
Speaker 0: The game last night was a blowout Yeah in the other direction like It was like I'm watching the game and like they scored and then I walked away to pee and I come back and I see What I assume is a replay of the score, and then I realized that no they just scored again

17
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:24,872
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,683
Speaker 0: so uh now Scott got me to.

19
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:34,810
Speaker 0: Scott and I are going to the game tomorrow and Before last night I was kind of assuming that this is gonna be the last hockey game of the season for us.

20
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:46,278
Speaker 0: Well now mathematically cannot be the last time you know this season, but I went from Expecting to go and see the end of the Rangers run to Not expecting to go and see them win.

21
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:52,900
Speaker 0: because I've learned from the master Scott as a New York fan If you're winning a game by three you could still fuck it up.

22
00:01:53,181 --> 00:02:06,416
Speaker 0: if you're winning by four you're probably gonna win By five in hockey Before it counts and you can say yeah, this game is over and turn it off because if you turn that game off It's gonna be a big comeback.

23
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,162
Speaker 1: even if you turn it off with ten points.

24
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,085
Speaker 1: It's still well uh.

25
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:15,590
Speaker 0: so uh What was what was the deal with that game with the Mets that I literally until yesterday assumed was a joke?

26
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,870
Speaker 1: Oh the pitcher got injured pretty early, and then they don't have another pitcher.

27
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,826
Speaker 1: No, they do, but you know but is he bad?

28
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:22,350
Speaker 0: like how bad?

29
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,943
Speaker 1: They put a lot of pitchers in baseball these days.

30
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:26,250
Speaker 1: you change pitchers like a whole bunch.

31
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,903
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, usually I mean a minimum.

32
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:30,210
Speaker 1: you're using like three a game.

33
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:35,627
Speaker 1: You know four or more sounds right, but they used a lot of and they just got their asses kicked cuz.

34
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:38,150
Speaker 0: uh That was quite days outs.

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,886
Speaker 0: They scored more in that game than RIT scored against Newman in that famous hockey game by one.

36
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:45,896
Speaker 1: see it's all like when you have A close game in any sport right.

37
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:52,210
Speaker 1: it's always sad when you like you lose by one because it's like ah I got a loss Even though I played really well.

38
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,510
Speaker 0: But then like when you push into three overtimes in a hockey game like you feel like you should have won.

39
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,661
Speaker 1: And but if you lose by 100, it's like well.

40
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,853
Speaker 1: That's the same thing as losing by one, so it's like It's like all right.

41
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:02,215
Speaker 1: Whatever.

42
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:03,320
Speaker 1: We're gonna lose anyway.

43
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,903
Speaker 1: who gives a shit.

44
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's arrest the good people Which doesn't matter is my guess for pitchers.

45
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,563
Speaker 0: that matters in basketball.

46
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,290
Speaker 1: They rest the good people, and it's a big problem.

47
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,345
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Because people only pay to see basketball to see the good.

48
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:18,050
Speaker 1: in the regular season Basketball is a big controversy is going on because the games they rest the good people.

49
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,750
Speaker 1: But you paid to see the good people and now you paid all this money to see bench people.

50
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:29,846
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess you're gonna watch him on the bench anyway They might not even show up if they're traveling they don't come to your town, so I stay home.

51
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:40,254
Speaker 0: it is it's Wednesday So there's a bunch of anime news and anime adjacent news But the one that you all out there might have noticed if you're dirty pirates Which I assume a lot of you are.

52
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:43,144
Speaker 0: yeah, is that an anime torrent site called?

53
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:56,541
Speaker 0: Yeah went down and That wouldn't really be news except that torrent site seems to have been the one that was the to use a Wall Street term the Liquidity provider for all the rest of the anime torrent.

54
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:59,210
Speaker 1: it was the backbone of many anime torrent sites.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:09,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, a liquidity provider is basically someone who is willing to publicly say hey I'll trade the stock like they will put liquidity into the market even but it's on other venues.

56
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:14,712
Speaker 0: So this was like this is where the torrents that people actually downloaded Originated.

57
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:20,115
Speaker 0: so all these other torrent sites that people thought oh, there's a ton of anime torrent sites There weren't?

58
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:22,690
Speaker 0: really there was one and a bunch of people leeching off of those.

59
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:36,988
Speaker 1: There's more but some of them have been private and so you know yeah It's like torrents are still the best way to distribute pirate stuff without getting taken down like YouTube style, but they are Increasingly retreating to the realm of nerdy people who know the deal.

60
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:41,250
Speaker 1: no yeah Well it's really people always like oh my god torrents so hard.

61
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,474
Speaker 1: Oh, they're not it's.

62
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:46,849
Speaker 1: you click a link you install a program wait on it so already set up that exe.

63
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,110
Speaker 0: so wait.

64
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,150
Speaker 0: I'm confident that if I just type torrent software the first exe I get is gonna be some malware.

65
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:56,074
Speaker 1: I think it'll probably be the official you Software.

66
00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:58,910
Speaker 1: you turn oh wow yeah, all right, which is micro towards.

67
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,178
Speaker 1: Now micro you torrent.

68
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:09,306
Speaker 0: I just people who call it you torrent are The people who type us for microseconds instead of actually typing the mu symbol.

69
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:10,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, can you type a new symbol?

70
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,839
Speaker 1: Yes, type it right now.

71
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:15,557
Speaker 0: I copy pasted Watch.

72
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:16,425
Speaker 0: how I type it watch.

73
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:16,970
Speaker 0: I type watch.

74
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,489
Speaker 0: Okay, what's going on here?

75
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,774
Speaker 1: How do you think I?

76
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:24,290
Speaker 1: how do you get to the Wikipedia page for it without typing it by typing?

77
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,014
Speaker 0: Micro wouldn't?

78
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,961
Speaker 1: it is pretty slow here.

79
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:33,022
Speaker 1: It's easier to micro Wikipedia the symbol But if you just go and type you it'll work in Google.

80
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:34,409
Speaker 1: you don't need to type the micro.

81
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,172
Speaker 0: yeah But I need.

82
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,763
Speaker 0: I want to type the micro when I am typing the word.

83
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:38,526
Speaker 1: I'll learn the show.

84
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,530
Speaker 1: so what's the alt code?

85
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,052
Speaker 1: It's right there.

86
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,319
Speaker 0: What is like if I can't type it?

87
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,772
Speaker 1: that often anyway the point is use You're just.

88
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:47,049
Speaker 1: the point is I see someone not you install this program.

89
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:49,594
Speaker 1: You torrent is.

90
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:53,546
Speaker 1: it is micro torrent is legit even though it has ads in it.

91
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,127
Speaker 1: It's you know.

92
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,030
Speaker 1: It's not malware.

93
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,950
Speaker 1: It's not sure that when you run the setup that exe you uncheck all the evil boxes someone in the chat.

94
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,869
Speaker 0: It's just like typing it over and over again.

95
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is that you can.

96
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:09,850
Speaker 1: there are other torrent clients that are really even less evil like transmission and such.

97
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:17,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway you install a program Then you go to a website you click a link the file downloads you double click on the file it plays.

98
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,288
Speaker 1: It'll play in Windows Media Player, but if for some reason it doesn't it'll play in VLC.

99
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,559
Speaker 1: Perfectly there is some crazy nut jobs.

100
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:24,900
Speaker 1: You're like.

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,075
Speaker 1: Oh you got to install this CCCP when do not install Bad news.

102
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:35,270
Speaker 1: because basically way back in the day way back there VLC didn't play all the files.

103
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,227
Speaker 0: But generally the files VLC didn't play were the ones that came from the shadiest of the sites.

104
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:46,208
Speaker 1: right nowadays VLC plays absolutely everything and his toe is even super legit.

105
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:50,210
Speaker 1: yeah And there's no reason it was all some shady Windows Media Player piece of garbage.

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,848
Speaker 0: Also most of this stuff just plays in Windows Media Player.

107
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:53,150
Speaker 0: guys.

108
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, regular Windows Media Player like it just works, or you know what do you have on Macs?

109
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:58,630
Speaker 1: quicktime something right?

110
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,225
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

111
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,577
Speaker 1: Point is you'll download a video file.

112
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:02,320
Speaker 1: You'll double-click it.

113
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,350
Speaker 1: It's gonna fucking play on your computer, and that's it.

114
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:12,250
Speaker 1: It's not as great as YouTube where you type in a URL and then press play that's true, but it's download a file Double-click on it

115
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:26,022
Speaker 0: And there's a gap between like the fact that you're getting this torrent file and getting the video and all these pieces Means that you're not gonna get malware unless you're dumb right or super Unknowledgeable mm-hmm, but even then point

116
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:31,540
Speaker 1: is if you want to distribute pirated stuff And you want to avoid YouTube takedowns just use bit torrent.

117
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,282
Speaker 1: stop fighting it.

118
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,027
Speaker 1: just use the old pirate Bay.

119
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,233
Speaker 1: use whatever tracker is The tracker right now.

120
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:39,062
Speaker 0: I change trackers even matter unless you're in the know.

121
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:46,770
Speaker 0: it is increasingly hard for a normal person who does not Know how to find the torrents in the first place especially when the torrent aggregators keep going down.

122
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,715
Speaker 1: I just go to pirate Bay.

123
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:48,660
Speaker 1: It's still there still work.

124
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,610
Speaker 0: for now part of a is having some increasing trouble.

125
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,123
Speaker 1: It's it's heavy increasing troubles for like decade plus.

126
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,290
Speaker 1: It's still there still works.

127
00:07:55,271 --> 00:08:00,498
Speaker 0: But most kids today just go to those like Blatant pirate sites like kiss anime or all.

128
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:06,939
Speaker 1: because if you go to Google and type in like I want to watch Naruto or Naruto Streams those are the fucking first results.

129
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, you search for some like.

130
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,570
Speaker 1: I want to read Naruto manga.

131
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:09,991
Speaker 1: It's like.

132
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,957
Speaker 1: the first result isn't buying it on Amazon.

133
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:14,646
Speaker 1: the first result isn't a site that has it legit.

134
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,511
Speaker 1: the first result is some pirate site.

135
00:08:16,531 --> 00:08:18,556
Speaker 1: that is very interesting to me.

136
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:28,002
Speaker 0: that the the piracy means that are more old-school in the sense of I Am pirating this thing to share with you because fuck everybody.

137
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:30,330
Speaker 0: I'm doing it for the freedom of media.

138
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:32,398
Speaker 0: That's right versus that's me.

139
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,570
Speaker 0: and those get taken down way harder than the site that's like.

140
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're just like openly making money off of other people's stuff.

141
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,543
Speaker 1: We're just a website that puts manga up with next to ads acting like we're legit.

142
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,637
Speaker 0: We are a crime website Doing crime.

143
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,830
Speaker 1: there's no nobility whatsoever.

144
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,838
Speaker 1: at least there's something noble about like.

145
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:58,927
Speaker 1: I am going to subtitle this and share it with the world because Someone who does not speak Japanese should not be denied this anime the joy of seeing space without Yamato.

146
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,010
Speaker 1: Yes for all.

147
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,549
Speaker 0: How is this website up?

148
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:04,529
Speaker 0: Like how how is this happening?

149
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:16,824
Speaker 0: but anyway, yeah, if you use Torrance to get anime like a million voices just cried out and were suddenly silenced and You'll still be able to get torrents of anime tomorrow.

150
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:17,990
Speaker 1: You just have to go somewhere different.

151
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,432
Speaker 1: It's a look.

152
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:20,098
Speaker 1: figure out what the new site is guys.

153
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:23,450
Speaker 0: It's not hard like c-roll is not paying us or anything.

154
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,897
Speaker 0: The c-roll is not expensive.

155
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:29,908
Speaker 1: crunchyroll is way cheap like in almost everything's on there.

156
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:31,353
Speaker 1: if it's not on there It's on Hulu.

157
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:32,035
Speaker 1: if it's not on there.

158
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:32,918
Speaker 1: It's on Funimation.

159
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:42,654
Speaker 1: when I was on Netflix when I was at alright Amazon Just pick whichever one has the show you want to watch and then once you're done watching all the shows what I do And switch to another one.

160
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:48,672
Speaker 0: and had no money and had internet to like I had the direct connect of pirate everything in the world Forever.

161
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,670
Speaker 0: if crunchyroll existed then I think I would have just paid for it.

162
00:09:53,452 --> 00:10:01,810
Speaker 0: It was just like the idea that you could just go to a website Pay a little bit of money and have access to like more than a couple of anime.

163
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,917
Speaker 0: It's still kind of crazy to me now.

164
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,921
Speaker 1: You can get all the anime.

165
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,069
Speaker 1: every episode of Fist of the North Star is on there.

166
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:12,510
Speaker 1: So for less than the cost of all the DVDs of all of us to the North Star you can watch it all.

167
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:22,607
Speaker 0: So in some other news, it's kind of really it's tangentially related, but on Monday We were talking about like pirate and stuff and today We're talking about pirate and stuff and like the nobility of the old world.

168
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,256
Speaker 0: so once again People met.

169
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:25,527
Speaker 0: someone made this cool like 2d.

170
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,158
Speaker 0: Hey, I made breath of the wild, but it's 2d.

171
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:31,550
Speaker 0: check this out and of course it got taken down.

172
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,738
Speaker 0: Like you can't get away with this.

173
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,618
Speaker 1: you can just stop making a website that says hey Look at me.

174
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,790
Speaker 1: My name is Scott Rubin.

175
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,054
Speaker 1: I made this thing.

176
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:44,166
Speaker 1: that is obviously blatant infringement of Nintendo's intellectual properties.

177
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,490
Speaker 1: come and get me Nintendo.

178
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:58,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I would put it up anonymously on bit tour and say I don't know who made this now Here, that's really awesome, and it keeps getting updated and it's totally these towards and the cryptographically sign that shit.

179
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,885
Speaker 0: So at some point in the future you could prove that you're the one who made it.

180
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:06,569
Speaker 0: Sure, but You got to get it out there first.

181
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:17,681
Speaker 0: If you're if your goals are purely noble if your goal is to make money and be the kiss anime of 2d breath of the wild Well, I don't know what you're expecting there.

182
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,926
Speaker 0: The world is different now.

183
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,595
Speaker 0: Yep And yet more news.

184
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:31,189
Speaker 1: if you want to see jubilees like jubilee movies if you don't realize they're on DVD I think all of them now, but if you want to see even in the ocean waves on DVD in America now.

185
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,084
Speaker 0: Fathom events, which is that thing where they'll do like an event in movie theaters.

186
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,957
Speaker 0: Sometimes it'll be a live stream thing Sometimes it'll be like.

187
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:40,110
Speaker 1: I wonder how much it cost to make our own fathom event.

188
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,150
Speaker 0: I was thinking about that because a lot of who would buy a ticket to our fat.

189
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,749
Speaker 1: So and what cut would we get?

190
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,609
Speaker 0: Podcasts that are two and a half to three tiers above us in terms of like real tears like in terms of like, you know hundreds of thousands of listeners.

191
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:02,113
Speaker 0: They do fathom events where they get on a stage somewhere and do the podcast and people can watch it live or semi-live Movie theaters.

192
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:03,841
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not out of the realm.

193
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,440
Speaker 0: It probably just costs some amount of money.

194
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,589
Speaker 1: You need real good internet in the place that has the stage.

195
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,902
Speaker 0: Yeah, I pretty sure that's taken care of.

196
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,149
Speaker 0: I could look into it.

197
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:24,419
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are dozens of people who would be interested in the Be a thousand there after this But already a thousand jay kids have a job.

198
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:31,326
Speaker 0: G kids is the go-to way to see anime in theaters and G kids and fathom are bringing six Ghibli movies.

199
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:36,990
Speaker 0: Totoro Laputa Kiki's spirited away howl's moving castle Nausicaa.

200
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:49,950
Speaker 0: There's gonna be subtitled and dubbed in theaters, but pretty much only in big cities I mean in New York, like every year IFC has like every Ghibli movie in New York.

201
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,390
Speaker 0: I think I've seen every major anime movie.

202
00:12:54,111 --> 00:13:00,114
Speaker 1: Hasn't been like a month gone by that I've lived here that you haven't been able to see at least one Ghibli movie in a Theater somewhere?

203
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:01,784
Speaker 0: never mind every new anime movie like.

204
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:02,930
Speaker 0: we just see them all in theaters.

205
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:03,754
Speaker 0: like it's not.

206
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:12,304
Speaker 0: the moral of this news is live in a city or I guess Tampa like if you live like in Florida or something, that's a real city.

207
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:13,347
Speaker 1: It's a city.

208
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:14,310
Speaker 1: It's certainly not a town.

209
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:15,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

210
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,643
Speaker 0: But I mean technically beacon is a city.

211
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:22,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Tampa has Professional sports teams all of them.

212
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:29,898
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a good Nationally known professional sports team.

213
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, Tampa has every sport.

214
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's the line.

215
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,758
Speaker 1: I don't think it has basketball team.

216
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:39,342
Speaker 1: Seattle does not have every kind of sport though I think the only basketball team in Florida is their Miami Heat.

217
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,207
Speaker 1: Do they need to have any?

218
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:40,790
Speaker 1: that's another one.

219
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,050
Speaker 1: So is the line Orlando Magic, but there's no Tampa basketball team.

220
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,163
Speaker 0: Is the line just one or all of the major sports?

221
00:13:48,604 --> 00:13:50,310
Speaker 0: cuz Seattle don't got no hockey team.

222
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,296
Speaker 1: Yeah has to have.

223
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:52,323
Speaker 1: they had basketball.

224
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:52,585
Speaker 1: they had.

225
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,149
Speaker 1: they had three.

226
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:53,752
Speaker 1: now They have two.

227
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:57,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think if you have a football team in America, that's nice.

228
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:57,990
Speaker 1: I'd already counts.

229
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,094
Speaker 0: I think you know, here's what you need.

230
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:04,929
Speaker 0: You need either a football team or Any two other national sports teams?

231
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one of those.

232
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,547
Speaker 0: football or pick two.

233
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:18,298
Speaker 1: But anyway, I think San Diego They had the Chargers and the Padres And now they lost the Chargers.

234
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, they only have baseball in San Diego.

235
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,859
Speaker 1: now I guess they might have soccer, but I don't think they have.

236
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,244
Speaker 1: there's no hockey.

237
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,710
Speaker 0: it Vegas doesn't have hot.

238
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,523
Speaker 1: No, it's the San Jose Sharks.

239
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,214
Speaker 1: There's no San Diego Hockey team.

240
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:33,222
Speaker 0: Vegas won't have hockey till next year.

241
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:34,627
Speaker 0: Well the end of this year.

242
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:37,157
Speaker 1: technically Yeah, Vegas is a major city without any.

243
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,706
Speaker 0: well is Vegas a city or is Vegas a theme park?

244
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:50,695
Speaker 0: Oh But yeah, you can see Ghibli's in the theater and Actually with modern projection like it's all digital and like really high quality It's actually worth it.

245
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:56,270
Speaker 0: If you've never seen a Ghibli movie in the theater, even if you've seen them all It's worth it to see one of them in the theater.

246
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:08,074
Speaker 1: I also imagine most people haven't seen all of them like we've seen all of them but like we're oddities people in the United States who are among a small number of people who have seen all of these almost all of these things and honestly like Ones worth seeing.

247
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:16,061
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen like all the Ghibli movies in the theater and you haven't seen La Pita Castle in the sky I go see that one in the theater because

248
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:16,763
Speaker 1: it's the first

249
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:25,489
Speaker 0: one and also it is Like there's a lot going on in that movie that is enhanced by being in a theater setting just the scope of it.

250
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,208
Speaker 0: Anyway, I digress.

251
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:29,295
Speaker 0: Another piece of news.

252
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:33,070
Speaker 0: you guys know we were for a while doing that new tennis show which is coming back.

253
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,097
Speaker 0: Just I got to do a bunch of crap first.

254
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:35,639
Speaker 0: Stay tuned.

255
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,770
Speaker 0: I'm fighting off like three takedowns, right?

256
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,117
Speaker 1: But here's some mutana that's not being taken down.

257
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:46,681
Speaker 0: All of utana is just on YouTube legally legally Subtitled for free.

258
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:50,964
Speaker 1: No crunchyroll Funimation Hulu required go to you.

259
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:51,567
Speaker 0: Only up to 480p.

260
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:59,979
Speaker 0: But utana was only made in like 480p like the blu-rays you can see Like cell defects.

261
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:05,996
Speaker 0: if you watch the remastered blu-rays like you can see 16 by 9 HD show.

262
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,864
Speaker 1: the show is from 1990 something not late.

263
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:09,406
Speaker 0: Yeah.

264
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,010
Speaker 0: It's a four by three anime.

265
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:13,530
Speaker 1: It was made for analog crap o TVs.

266
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:22,408
Speaker 0: So watching on YouTube in 480p is just fine and frankly if you're free for free Just you know, if you're a geek nights fan, you've been a geek nights fan for the last 12 years.

267
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,623
Speaker 0: You've probably seen utana because we talk about it a lot.

268
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:35,279
Speaker 0: if you've never seen Shojo Kakuma utana, it is a real important anime in terms like there's By so many things and there's not one.

269
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,770
Speaker 1: it also once you see it and you're gonna go back to some other thing you saw And be like, oh, that's a new tenor reference that I miss desert.

270
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,076
Speaker 0: But also it's a bridge.

271
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:53,805
Speaker 0: those references to utana are in a way bridges because utana is referencing Even weirder stuff like brother dear brother that I'm sure you've never seen.

272
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,250
Speaker 1: isn't brother your brother newer than antenna?

273
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,735
Speaker 1: You I'm pretty sure you 10.

274
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:02,560
Speaker 1: It doesn't reference brother dear brother.

275
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,563
Speaker 0: They're very similar.

276
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,786
Speaker 0: Yeah 91 other.

277
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:10,214
Speaker 0: I think they were contemporary Mmm, but the manga 70s the anime didn't come out till 91 92.

278
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:14,773
Speaker 1: I don't know Whatever the point is.

279
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,297
Speaker 1: it's for free on YouTube.

280
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:16,858
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

281
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:18,407
Speaker 1: Watch it utana.

282
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:20,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

283
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,467
Speaker 0: There are things that are like it.

284
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:29,729
Speaker 0: But the things that are like it are also made by ikuhara Rosa Versailles kinda.

285
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:37,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, or well, I mean there's yurikuma which is the most recent iteration of let's have I mean Rosa Versailles right heavily.

286
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,069
Speaker 1: It's probably the thing that influenced utana a bunch.

287
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:57,840
Speaker 0: yeah, visually I guess you know, but I Can't think of anything that told the same story that attended the way that told it with that combination of weird music and weird allegory, you know allegory or allegory is If you haven't seen utana you literally have no excuse.

288
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,182

297
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:39,100
Speaker 0: There was a toy Series like one of those lines of toys that I had as a kid that I remember being super fucking legit.

298
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:48,720
Speaker 0: But at the same time I also remembered he-man being super fucking legit Mm-hmm, and there was a point in my life when I learned my lesson that he-man is the opposite of legit.

299
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:50,479
Speaker 1: I mean, it's legitimately bad.

300
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it is the toys thing.

301
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:55,778
Speaker 1: is the he-man toys are actually good the show which is bad.

302
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,592
Speaker 0: They're okay They're not as good as the show is.

303
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:08,712
Speaker 0: hey, yeah Yeah mass toys were like way better than even the best transformers in terms of the physicality of the toy The best toy in terms of action figures ever.

304
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:09,554
Speaker 1: It's the technodrome.

305
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,680
Speaker 1: They're real metal Voltron.

306
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're gonna go yeah, you wanna go real toys.

307
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:16,540
Speaker 0: I had a toy was a toy gun.

308
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,543
Speaker 0: There was my grandpa's.

309
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:19,610
Speaker 1: it was actually a gun the shop.

310
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:30,075
Speaker 0: It was an actually a gun, but you put these low Gunpowder cartridges in it that weren't that dangerous But it was basically actual gun actual gun.

311
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,649
Speaker 1: Yeah actual weak gun But not as good as Voltron.

312
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:38,229
Speaker 0: so I found I stumbled upon The commercial for these toys.

313
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,696
Speaker 0: the toys were spy tech.

314
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:40,519
Speaker 1: I never heard of it.

315
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:51,400
Speaker 0: So these toys were almost without an exception Garbage legit spy shit like if you wanted to actually spy on people for real.

316
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,064
Speaker 0: They were like.

317
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:54,290
Speaker 0: that was what they reported to do.

318
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,100
Speaker 0: I'm skip they legit did it.

319
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,983
Speaker 0: So, you know what they were.

320
00:19:57,003 --> 00:20:02,600
Speaker 0: one of them was this really compact periscope that you could like unfold and spy on people with.

321
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,182
Speaker 0: it Was really good.

322
00:20:03,644 --> 00:20:05,854
Speaker 0: One of them was some walkie-talkies like back then.

323
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,686
Speaker 0: walkie-talkies were like a Walkie-talkies like $100.

324
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:09,149
Speaker 1: No, they were cheap.

325
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,493
Speaker 1: Well, I had walkie-talkies, but they weren't spy tech but they were.

326
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:19,767
Speaker 0: but they were branded like a part of the toy set But you could hide him cuz you like warm on your belt Large and actually they worked quite well.

327
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:23,840
Speaker 1: and I had a Morse code chart printed on the front and I know exactly the Fisher price one.

328
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,807
Speaker 0: I know exactly an orange button.

329
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,980
Speaker 0: You know, I had that exact walkie-talkie, but you could also talk.

330
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:33,416
Speaker 0: I know exactly which one you're talking about cuz I had that exact same one.

331
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:38,746
Speaker 1: these guys Yes, that's the one they actually Think was a little better than that one.

332
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:39,589
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

333
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, is it that one?

334
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:42,578
Speaker 1: No, that's an actual.

335
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,688
Speaker 1: yeah The chart on the front of mine wasn't a piece of paper.

336
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,100
Speaker 1: it was like a plastic in like raised thing.

337
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:52,044
Speaker 0: Was it this one?

338
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,170
Speaker 0: No, cuz that one I also had.

339
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:59,827
Speaker 1: it was mine regret, but it's very very similar effectively the same toy Yeah, but these were like hidden.

340
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:03,855
Speaker 0: like you wore the belt pack and actually worked really well and you had this tiny like transmitter in your ear.

341
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,226
Speaker 0: It had sunglasses you could wear.

342
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,012
Speaker 0: that had like mirrors you could see behind you.

343
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,000
Speaker 0: that were discreet like they're actually discreet.

344
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,109
Speaker 0: It had motion detectors you could leave.

345
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:16,626
Speaker 0: that would like set off alarms and had signal lights and Like they weren't.

346
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,919
Speaker 0: that like super high-tech like they were pretty simple stuff.

347
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,026
Speaker 0: But I put.

348
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:26,447
Speaker 0: I looked into like how well they work and I found a bunch of people like reviewing them from a modern Standpoint.

349
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:33,260
Speaker 0: they were legit Like if you want to spy on other people's for real to find things out about them.

350
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:45,740
Speaker 0: These toys were way more functional than I think like parents who bought them for their kids realized And I would not be surprised if more than one kid found out where dad was going when he worked late with this shit.

351
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:54,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is one of the first commercial for spy tech and the craziest thing about this commercial seems vaguely familiar.

352
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, you watch the commercial at commercials and you'll see they were skipping through it.

353
00:21:58,414 --> 00:21:59,337
Speaker 0: They were a series.

354
00:21:59,858 --> 00:22:02,650
Speaker 0: I had Every one of these fucking toys.

355
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:08,635
Speaker 0: I had none of these toys and I used them to spy on the neighbors Like I like legit spied through neighbors windows.

356
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:09,700
Speaker 1: What'd you learn about the neighbors?

357
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:13,619
Speaker 0: Real boring stuff like nothing interesting at any point ever.

358
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:19,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the craziest part was that they came with manuals that were like how to spy on people.

359
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,900
Speaker 0: I found some of the manuals and I was reading through them today when I thought about doing this new this thing of the day.

360
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:30,055
Speaker 0: They give legit advice on how to do dead drops and like how to tail people without getting caught.

361
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:32,040
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm like real advice.

362
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,818
Speaker 0: So that was a thing.

363
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:41,079
Speaker 0: Oh number one comment on this video, why are a bunch of kids stalking that guy commuting to work?

364
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:44,115
Speaker 0: Comment one because they know what's up.

365
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:47,584
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

366
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:53,340
Speaker 1: for me this is just a tweet with some pictures in it But what this is is in Turkey's doing some archaeology.

367
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,256
Speaker 1: It's like as despite how our bad things are there you can still do archaeology.

368
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,140
Speaker 1: They're just fine.

369
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:01,507
Speaker 1: and This guy uncovered a mosaic.

370
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,655
Speaker 1: mosaics are like the best except for tapestries.

371
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:04,840
Speaker 1: mosaics like second best.

372
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:08,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I was in Turkey, one of the best things is seeing the old mosaics all over the city.

373
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,067
Speaker 1: I kind of want to make mosaics.

374
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:12,060
Speaker 1: I feel like I can't draw but I feel like I could make a mosaic.

375
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:13,530
Speaker 0: It's basically just pixel art.

376
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:14,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could do that anyway.

377
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:17,930
Speaker 1: Only pixels can be any shape and size.

378
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,015
Speaker 1: Yeah color.

379
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:36,900

380
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,988
Speaker 1: But basically it's an awesome skeleton.

Speaker 1: It's at least centuries old.

382
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:45,932
Speaker 0: if not, okay It's it's earlier than I thought I was gonna guess like 500 600 AD.

383
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,196
Speaker 0: It's actually third century.

384

00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,560
Speaker 1: I didn't even go to the Goron zone.

400
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been to every other zone But I'm cleaning up all the other zones and upgrading tons and tons of shit before I go to the Goron.

401
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,939
Speaker 1: Also, I learned I imagine when I do go to the Goron zone I'm just gonna blow it out of the water like I did not know horses could die.

402
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:06,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, they kept saying one died, but I didn't really think about it.

403
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,360
Speaker 0: So I was fighting some mob limbs that were way more dangerous than any right to be in a place.

404
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,675
Speaker 0: That is way more dangerous than I expected and they fucking killed my horse.

Speaker 0: Yeah, but now my good horse I don't really care.

406
00:25:17,563 --> 00:25:21,839
Speaker 0: It was uh, it was a horse that I got because I thought it was good and then I found way better horses.

407
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:25,859
Speaker 0: But yeah now I know that horses can die and it's real sad.

408
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:28,095
Speaker 0: Emily was like is that horse dead?

409
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:32,716

Speaker 0: Whoo Cuz you won't play against me.

471
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:25,656
Speaker 0: No, so yeah, we are we're doing double feature here.

472
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:26,780
Speaker 0: cuz these are two little comics.

473
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,159
Speaker 0: They could not be more different.

474
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,006
Speaker 0: That is well, I know.

475
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:35,056
Speaker 1: one of them is actual manga and one of them is manga influenced.

476
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, manga ask.

477
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,930
Speaker 1: So we'll talk about that first.

478
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:44,894
Speaker 1: So basically, you know, I've heard of Not the dissolving classroom, but the diss is a disappearing classroom.

479
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think is the other one.

480
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,688
Speaker 1: There might even be more in the series.

481
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,297
Speaker 0: Well, so this didn't even of a series.

482
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:52,020
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize.

483
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:53,565
Speaker 0: Several I think it's.

484
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:54,751
Speaker 0: I want to say there's five.

485
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:56,560
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize it was a series.

486
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,763
Speaker 0: Oh, there's seven of them.

487
00:29:57,803 --> 00:29:58,345
Speaker 1: What are they?

488
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:03,177
Speaker 0: dissolving classroom meet again children of the earth worshiping beauty or dissolving beauty.

489
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:04,260
Speaker 0: dissolving apartment.

490
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:05,625
Speaker 0: She's a cheese.

491
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:10,142
Speaker 0: It means dissolving love and the demons conference is gonna be the last one Right.

492
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,051
Speaker 1: So like, you know, there's two different classroom ones, right?

493
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:22,411
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, I didn't realize it - they're all they're all by Junji ito, but Junji Ito You probably know from.

494
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:33,640
Speaker 0: you probably don't know the name of it But you've definitely encountered the weird spiral manga Because people like to post screenshots of that all the time all over the internet with no context.

495
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,580
Speaker 0: So that's what that is.

496
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,599
Speaker 1: The thing is it's like this Junji Ito is a name you associate with like Japanese horror manga, right?

497
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,003
Speaker 1: Who did the?

498
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:42,509
Speaker 1: what's the one with the fish?

499
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:43,453
Speaker 1: is that Uzumaki?

500
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:44,457
Speaker 1: Is that also Junji?

501
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:45,280
Speaker 1: That's Junji Ito.

502
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,380
Speaker 1: Alright, I feel like there's one other person who also does horror manga.

503
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,771
Speaker 1: That's super famous and like but I just get them confused all the time because they all blend together because the styles feel similar well, because yeah, I mean.

504
00:30:56,912 --> 00:31:06,573
Speaker 0: obviously there's a lot of Variants in there, but most of the Japanese visual media like drawn or animated horror I've encountered has pretty much looked like this.

505
00:31:06,593 --> 00:31:13,479
Speaker 0: I mean Well, I mean other than yamashibai which is a similar style in a lot of ways.

506
00:31:14,283 --> 00:31:17,599
Speaker 0: That's I mostly encounter yamashibai and Junji Ito.

507
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:27,587
Speaker 0: so this comic is straight-up body horror in a Japanese style Like that is it?

508
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:32,945
Speaker 0: in a nutshell if body horror is Your jam you will like this.

509
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:38,585
Speaker 0: if body horror bothers you you will hate this and you should not read it because you will hate it.

510
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:54,292
Speaker 0: So the story is basically about this normal-looking dude and this really scary looking girl who is this younger sister and If you encounter them your brains probably going to melt.

511
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,040
Speaker 0: and that's pretty much the entire plot.

512
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I didn't know what this was.

513
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,340
Speaker 1: I just knew it was like a famous horror manga and I didn't realize it was a series.

514
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:10,720
Speaker 1: but it showed up and I read it and it was way quick to read which is nice and I didn't know exactly what the story was at all.

515
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,740
Speaker 1: I knew as I figured it was gonna be about us like a You know a school of kids in class in a classroom and that horror shit would keep happening to them.

516
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,367
Speaker 1: But no that was only like the beginning part.

517
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:29,060
Speaker 1: and then it's actually these multiple stories that are only linked together a little Bit kind of because there's a few characters they keep going through.

518
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:30,734
Speaker 1: Right the whole thing.

519
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:40,780
Speaker 0: Yep So the basically you're introduced to these characters and if you'd start reading it You're gonna think wow that sister is super scary and dangerous and the kids just trying to deal with it.

520
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the deal with this kid who has a crazy evil sister who's murdering everyone?

521
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,160
Speaker 1: He can't keep her under control.

522
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:51,960
Speaker 0: The moral of this is that kid is a bad person and he deserves all this even though actually he seems to be enjoying himself.

523
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:53,771
Speaker 0: You can't tell right?

524
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:55,340
Speaker 1: It's sort of it's somewhat ambiguous.

525
00:32:55,541 --> 00:33:05,880
Speaker 0: Well, it's all ambiguous because I feel like those two characters exist Primarily from face value as a vehicle to get body horror into your eyes.

526
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:07,368
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much they are.

527
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:15,119
Speaker 0: they're just a vehicle for body horror Mostly around your body melting or becoming horrifying in some way and you can't get around it.

528
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:22,015
Speaker 0: but on a much more meta level the When you read this and I'm not gonna spoil too much because you know, you can just read this thing

529
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:22,376
Speaker 1: Satan,

530
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:33,420
Speaker 0: but yeah Originally, he sort of portrays himself as like yeah, I'm cursed by the devil my sister, you know I messed with devil shit and now my sister is cursed and I'm trying to protect her and live my life.

531
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,400
Speaker 0: I'm so sorry, but then the sister is like, yeah, he was fucking torturing animals and Satan came after him.

532
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,565
Speaker 1: He fucking loves the devil.

533
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,535
Speaker 1: He's not he's not accident.

534
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:43,640
Speaker 1: He's like he's Satan's best.

535
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:51,193
Speaker 0: I really like oh I tortured animals as a kid because That's how I relieve stress in my life and that no he's like.

536
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:53,140
Speaker 1: no you tortured animals cuz you love Satan.

537
00:33:53,684 --> 00:34:09,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you want him to love you back But the G you find find out like early on that the deal is if he apologizes to you Satan gives him an orgasm essentially and your brain starts melting.

538
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:20,380
Speaker 0: and the more he Apologizes to you the more your brain melts until you die and then melt into a puddle And the sister eats your brains and you or they store it in bottles.

539
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:23,509
Speaker 0: You think that is too much of a spoiler.

540
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:27,924
Speaker 0: his other seems like the first ten pages and it just goes off from his other Superpower is.

541
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:32,418
Speaker 1: he tells people how pretty they are and they become ugly but think they're pretty.

542
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:40,344
Speaker 1: when he does this It's like more the more he says well also being like this heart, you know, like gross-out kind of horror Thing.

543
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:49,420
Speaker 1: it's also this commentary in Japanese society Which you know has worse problems than America does in terms of you know, personal appearance.

544
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,045
Speaker 1: Issues now bear in mind.

545
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:55,540
Speaker 1: we earned also constantly apologizing even when you're not the person who did anything wrong.

546
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:07,757
Speaker 0: we are neither Japanese nor experts on Japanese culture, but the plot of this dude Apologizes to people all the time to basically be on one hand.

547
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,680
Speaker 0: He does bad things and his sisters does bad things.

548
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:17,798
Speaker 0: He apologizes for those things and everyone around him is sort of obligated to accept those apologies.

549
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:20,305
Speaker 1: and he likes Apologizing a lot.

550
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:21,127
Speaker 0: but think about this.

551
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:29,592
Speaker 0: you do something bad and then you are automatically forgiven By society whether or not you should be forgive.

552
00:35:29,612 --> 00:35:32,300
Speaker 1: you are forgiven for melting these people's brains and loving Satan.

553
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:37,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so he apologizes to people and they have to accept it.

554
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,180
Speaker 0: So as a result, he gets to keep doing these terrible things to people.

555
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:44,320
Speaker 0: But also he is not actually ever apologizing because he's sorry.

556
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:50,900
Speaker 0: He's apologizing for his own selfish reasons and taking advantage of the fact that other people will accept those apologies.

557
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:58,919
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and the one girl who was sort of saved from this Really is only saved because she passes out before he can keep apologizing to her.

558
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:05,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but she has her whole arc which she tries to expose them and I'm not gonna spoil whether or not she succeeds.

559
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:09,299
Speaker 1: The point is in him, you know If you want to read some horror mangas, right?

560
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:12,112
Speaker 1: Is like the go-to of the horror manga.

561
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,020
Speaker 0: cuz these guys these are direct.

562
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,786
Speaker 0: These are like you want to see some horror?

563
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,549
Speaker 0: Let's see how many pages.

564
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:19,860
Speaker 0: a lot of the other zero as far as poor on the cover.

565
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,219
Speaker 0: Let's start horror in the first page.

566
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:28,736
Speaker 0: Okay, there's no horror in the very first page of the manga except he apologizes to everyone in the class.

567
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:33,250
Speaker 0: one two Three four up there's there's some horror.

568
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:36,120
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is let me suck your brains out here.

569
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:42,680
Speaker 1: Bigger series like this go which is the one with the fish and Uzumaki, which is I think the spiral one, right?

570
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,659
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like those are longer series.

571
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,610
Speaker 1: So you might not know if you're into this.

572
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,620
Speaker 1: like you don't want to go into you can just read this.

573
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,359
Speaker 1: It's like a one-shot tiny deal.

574
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,954
Speaker 1: It's like be your intro to the world of this kind of style of manga To figure out if you want to go deeper and read the rest of everything out there.

575
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:13,560
Speaker 0: Yep, or not what's cool is at the very end after you learn a bunch more about Satan and Whether or not the story resolves itself because it resolves itself to a degree You get a couple of really really short like four-page comics.

576
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:16,467
Speaker 0: Did you read those at the very end like after the story?

577
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:19,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I remember them.

578
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:26,717
Speaker 0: They're not about people melting They're just like horror vignettes like really simple ones that are kind of interesting.

579
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:36,328
Speaker 0: I It's hard for me to be super like generally objective about a review of this kind of stuff Because I really like horror in general.

580
00:37:36,368 --> 00:37:40,800
Speaker 0: I mean, I listen to pseudopod like constantly like I like contemporary horror fiction.

581
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:43,503
Speaker 1: I've been watching horror movies since I was like I would really like.

582
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:47,420
Speaker 1: I just I just like this for like the pictures of Satan and the pictures of people's heads melting.

583
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:49,893
Speaker 1: Yeah, right that alone is enough for me to read it.

584
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:51,100
Speaker 1: But is it enough for you to read it?

585
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,460
Speaker 1: It might make you want to not read it depending on who you are.

586
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like.

587
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,308
Speaker 1: I cannot stress this and it's not for everybody.

588
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:06,040
Speaker 0: if you do not like body horror, which is a very Specific genre of horror then you will not like this at all.

589
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,974
Speaker 1: If you don't want to see a human body doing things human bodies don't do.

590
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:11,055
Speaker 1: Yep.

591
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:12,639
Speaker 1: Don't look at this.

592
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:22,679
Speaker 0: If you're were if you were bothered by irrevocable diffuse harm to your person Because this is pretty horrifying shit, and I love it.

593
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,268
Speaker 0: So there's not much else to say.

594
00:38:25,308 --> 00:38:27,900
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna spoil a big manga, which is why we're doing a two-shot.

595
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:30,140
Speaker 0: But it goes way.

596
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,387
Speaker 0: It just goes.

597
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,614
Speaker 0: you're gonna think like, okay.

598
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:33,700
Speaker 0: I see what's going on with this.

599
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,738
Speaker 0: No, it'll escalate like page by page and never stop escalating.

600
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:41,611
Speaker 1: Yep So the other thing we read is wrecked heart.

601
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:43,560
Speaker 1: So this I got at the mocha festival this year.

602
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:50,292
Speaker 1: I just saw it on a table and I was like, wow, that looks really well put together And I like the colors and hearts.

603
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:51,317
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna buy that.

604
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:51,860
Speaker 1: so I bought it.

605
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,831
Speaker 1: So what it is is it's not a manga.

606
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:57,380
Speaker 0: it's by two awesome artists in Sweden.

607
00:38:57,741 --> 00:39:07,007
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's called wrecked hearts and it's basically two different comics that have similar themes of Heartbreak and hearts.

608
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,852
Speaker 0: Well dark shoujo.

609
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:11,299
Speaker 0: So it's heartbreak sci-fi shoujo.

610
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:13,532
Speaker 1: Yes Which is already great.

611
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:19,200
Speaker 1: Yeah The physical publishing of it looks like a manga, right?

612
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,590
Speaker 1: It's got the even has a little strip of paper that goes around the cover.

613
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a manga in Japan would write and such.

614
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,294
Speaker 1: So that's pretty nice.

615
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,830
Speaker 1: Inside has got nice paper.

616
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:37,940
Speaker 1: The first story is Sort of got like a watercolor to it and the second story sort of has like a zip a tone deal.

617
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,733
Speaker 0: When Scott told me to read this we could read on a gig.

618
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:45,480
Speaker 0: not so what he said was Emily wrote Andrew the first of these two guys, so there's two stories in here.

619
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:57,944
Speaker 1: The first story is the real thing by Luca Oliveri, which I'm pretty sure is Emily's pen name Yeah, and the second one is dark energy by mythilda kitty which is Not written by Emily.

620
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,247
Speaker 0: Yep.

621
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,932
Speaker 1: I mean could be but it doesn't seem like it.

622
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:01,975
Speaker 1: The first one definitely is.

623
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:12,888
Speaker 0: so the first one has mysterious girls with powers and shape-changing and complicated gender roles and romance and space and Hockey, that's right.

624
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:13,995
Speaker 1: It doesn't have bunnies though.

625
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:16,138
Speaker 0: No bunnies It's like if it had bunnies.

626
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:22,474
Speaker 0: And the second one is more I don't know.

627
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:29,240
Speaker 0: it reminded me of particularly like that kind of moto-hagio type show Joe sci-fi.

628
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,440
Speaker 0: Yes story was like they were 11 to it because actually they both fit into that.

629
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,828
Speaker 0: They were 11 mold.

630
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,880
Speaker 1: It's got some Tezuka going on in there.

631
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,197
Speaker 0: The second one was way more Tezuka and the first one was way more like 70s sci-fi show Joe.

632
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:43,538
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

633
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:45,805
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean they're both sort of that.

634
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:46,949
Speaker 1: but anyway, right.

635
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:53,448
Speaker 1: so the first story right you've got basically this girl and He plays hockey.

636
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:58,545
Speaker 1: Yep space hockey space On the moon.

637
00:40:58,565 --> 00:40:59,728
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

638
00:40:59,828 --> 00:41:03,337
Speaker 0: Yep, and she's just really funny and like the character.

639
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:13,699
Speaker 0: like they're short stories They escalate pretty quickly but her dad's an alien and she's actually totally a shape-shifter with crazy powers and She's just living among the humans and can't really reveal what she really is.

640
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:21,330
Speaker 1: She also really has the hots for this dude, but when she dreams about the dude She dreams that she's a dude, but she's a shape-shifter.

641
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,236
Speaker 1: So is she even the dude?

642
00:41:23,336 --> 00:41:24,078
Speaker 0: is there even gender, right?

643
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,408
Speaker 1: So it has that sort of, you know Transgender message going on there, right?

644
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,177
Speaker 1: It's like oh well what you know, here's a shape-shifting person.

645
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:31,839
Speaker 1: What do you think of that?

646
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,243
Speaker 1: Transphobic person.

647
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:33,685
Speaker 1: Yep.

648
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:34,748
Speaker 0: Yeah gender.

649
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:35,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, how about that?

650
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:49,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, and and it's a short stories We're not gonna really spoil anything But you sort of pieced together that part of the reason why she dreams that she's a dude when she's with him is because he had a boyfriend who may or may not be dead.

651
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:54,693
Speaker 0: hmm and She is not allowed to use her powers because her dad told her not to.

652
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:59,920
Speaker 1: and she decides Well, you don't want everyone to know that you're a shape-shifting alien when they don't know shape-shifting aliens exist.

653
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,574
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not clear that anyone knows that aliens exist at all.

654
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:09,620
Speaker 0: in like this world Like the fact that she's an alien could be a real real problem if it got out.

655
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,571
Speaker 1: But apparently they do have space travel.

656
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:12,899
Speaker 1: they go and do it on the moon and shit.

657
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:24,099
Speaker 0: but she decides to have this plan to Shape-shift into a dude and go on an all-male hockey trip with them.

658
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:25,951
Speaker 1: I don't think it's an all-male hockey trip.

659
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,340
Speaker 1: I think it's just a school hockey trip.

660
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,110
Speaker 0: But yeah, she has a plan that involves touching his dick.

661
00:42:31,512 --> 00:42:32,675
Speaker 1: Yeah good plan.

662
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:38,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a solid plan A+ and you can find you read this you'll find out how much dick-touching happens.

663
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:41,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh, this is I really liked it.

664
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,044
Speaker 0: It's a good story.

665
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:44,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's I mean, even though we just talked about dick-touching.

666
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:47,450
Speaker 1: It's not like a porn It's not a yaoi or anything like that.

667
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,560
Speaker 1: It's not graphic sexually in any way.

668
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,710
Speaker 1: It's appropriate for young teens who at least know what sex is.

669
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like 13 14 and up, right?

670
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,317
Speaker 1: I mean this is worse shit on TV in primetime than this.

671
00:42:58,337 --> 00:43:09,766
Speaker 0: and It does the thing that I like about this that I don't want to say this era of shoujo or this era of this kind of sci-fi because This is from this current era.

672
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:16,767
Speaker 0: This is contemporary science fiction, but that 70s style like Japanese shoujo sci-fi.

673
00:43:17,348 --> 00:43:27,640
Speaker 0: it really covers that those kinds of issues in that kind of way and It addresses its subject matter in a really interesting and thoughtful way without spelling it all out for you.

674
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:35,042
Speaker 1: And also, I mean the second story does this also, but it is not go where you predict it's gonna go Can't?

675
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:36,411
Speaker 0: we can't like it's.

676
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:37,960
Speaker 1: it is a fresh story, right?

677
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,497
Speaker 1: It is not some old tired trope that is repeated right is totally fresh.

678
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:50,996
Speaker 0: Yeah and Refreshing to read the second story is dark energy Vaguely because I really don't want to ruin much about it because you should read it.

679
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:51,540
Speaker 0: It's really good.

680
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,588
Speaker 1: It's got some cuteness going on a lot of cuteness.

681
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,460
Speaker 0: It is much more Tezuka sci-fi in a lot of ways.

682
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,869
Speaker 1: Like you said, yeah, it's got a little katamari action.

683
00:43:58,909 --> 00:43:59,210
Speaker 1: There's

684
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:01,739
Speaker 0: a cute little robot guy who kind of looks like a taiko drum

685
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:02,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, and

686
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:15,000
Speaker 0: he can turn into a boy but only for a little while at a time or it rains his battery Mm-hmm, and there's this girl with a mysterious past who's alone on a spaceship and may or may not also be a plant on the spaceship

687
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:20,520
Speaker 1: Right that she lives on a spaceship that basically is a place that grows plants and she's all alone on there.

688
00:44:21,102 --> 00:44:32,017
Speaker 0: Right and she meets this robot almost like a biodome kind of deal and they hang out together And the robot has a crush on her and it escalates while the robots lonely in space.

689
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:32,900
Speaker 1: and so is this girl.

690
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:50,568
Speaker 1: So you meet the first person you meet and saying like if I'm not like regardless of who the hell they are It could be ugly fat that guy Yep right and if I'm alone in space for a long period of time and I end up on a space station and the only living thing there is That guy I mean, I

691
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:52,052
Speaker 0: don't feel it now,

692
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:59,622
Speaker 1: but I could imagine even going that far Suddenly be real to be into the lonely fat that guy like oh my god It's a person.

693
00:45:00,104 --> 00:45:02,191
Speaker 1: even the worst person is better than no person.

694
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:05,020
Speaker 1: interaction of any kind and this is a great person.

695
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,125
Speaker 1: It's a cute plant girl.

696
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, cute plant girl.

697
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:07,932
Speaker 0: Thank you.

698
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:09,338
Speaker 0: I go drama robot cute.

699
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:09,840
Speaker 1: I go dry.

700
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,899
Speaker 0: potentially cute space girl who might be the other girls ex is also totally badass.

701
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:17,060
Speaker 1: and

702
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:28,263
Speaker 0: to not really say anything else about where this goes it deals with a Bunch of issues in a really oblique way Yeah the ideas of in

703
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:34,340
Speaker 1: a really short amount of time and without and it still leaves space space for space stuff and cute stuff

704
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:45,540
Speaker 0: Yep, and also like really existential stuff, but self-identity toxic relationships Past relationships in light of the future loneliness.

705
00:45:47,082 --> 00:45:49,751
Speaker 0: And like I said, it deals with these in really oblique ways.

706
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:57,680
Speaker 0: both of these comics, but particularly the second one They're like the failure of a lot of contemporary science fiction is spelling out.

707
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:59,125
Speaker 0: Here's the question.

708
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:03,140
Speaker 1: I am asking in right like the first one is a little less subtle with its.

709
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,769
Speaker 1: You know, we are going to discuss trans things.

710
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:08,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, even though it does a really good job.

711
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:09,592
Speaker 0: gender identity It's not issues.

712
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:18,280
Speaker 0: attraction It's not super subtle and in like that is my message But it brings in a lot of ancillary and related issues in subtle ways to complement the story.

713
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:32,201
Speaker 0: This other one is like here is a story and if you're clever you'll realize oh It's about like these four or five things And it doesn't really give you a clear answer.

714
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:51,424
Speaker 1: it just says have you thought about this stuff Mmm, and I don't want to say a lot more because it's if you want to read some not manga that has very nice contemporary and modern ish Storytelling with really good arts in a really nice Publication format.

715
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:53,290
Speaker 1: I don't know how you can get this thing.

716
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,895
Speaker 0: You can buy it on this website right here.

717
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,260
Speaker 1: Oh, how about that?

718
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,420
Speaker 1: So yeah, I bought had to buy it at a really indie comic-con, but you can buy it on some website.

719
00:47:03,102 --> 00:47:08,075
Speaker 1: The website seems legit and I'm sure if you give that website money, they will send you this comic.

720
