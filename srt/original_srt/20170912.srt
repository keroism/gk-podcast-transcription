1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,102
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday September 12th 2017.

2
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:14,249
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,649
Speaker 0: tonight We're talking about exit the game the secret lab.

4
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,543
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:36,239
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're back from basically a two-week hiatus because we had PAX West which basically is a full week and then I went straight from PAX to New York and then immediately back to Utah to go mountain biking.

6
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,119
Speaker 0: and Now we're back.

7
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:44,040
Speaker 0: I'm back in my normal life And we played a lot of games at PAX that we had not played before.

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,439
Speaker 1: We played like every game people brought plus games that were at PAX that were new plus everything.

9
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,616
Speaker 0: Yep I think offhand the games that stick out the most which we're not gonna talk about on this show.

10
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:54,279
Speaker 0: We got to save it.

11
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:59,120
Speaker 0: Black Friday, like really was better than I could have possibly expected.

12
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:03,296
Speaker 1: Maybe the best stock market game I've played were you buying and selling stocks and out.

13
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:04,080
Speaker 1: their prices are down.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,626
Speaker 1: Prices are going up and down.

15
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,000
Speaker 0: downforce was fun, but a little disappointing like it.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,646
Speaker 0: There's not as much to it as camel up.

17
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:13,295
Speaker 1: Yeah downforce is like it.

18
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:14,640
Speaker 1: It's a good game that I like.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,546
Speaker 1: I just wonder how many plays it has.

20
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:17,970
Speaker 1: it's one of those games that it's like.

21
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:24,332
Speaker 1: good should buy but eventually You're not gonna use all those score sheets before you don't want to play down.

22
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,660
Speaker 0: Oh, it's anymore and it's an unlike formula.

23
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:26,981
Speaker 0: Did?

24
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:29,931
Speaker 0: it doesn't seem like it could expand as easily?

25
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:31,496
Speaker 1: I think it could expand.

26
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,106
Speaker 0: you'd have to add mechanics However maps right?

27
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,234
Speaker 0: Yes, but it expands just by a new map.

28
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:37,920
Speaker 0: Like I have the Singapore map totally different game.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,720
Speaker 1: Yes, it could expand it which would make it, you know extend it quite a bit.

30
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:46,400
Speaker 1: The problem is it should have had that expansion in the original box already.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we played on the most advanced mode that was in that box.

32
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:50,017
Speaker 0: It was not enough.

33
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:53,462
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm sticking sticking Whatever.

34
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:59,740
Speaker 1: that game was nice trick-taking game that we never finished because of the seventh guest but it was super backwards that game.

35
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:01,825
Speaker 1: It's the backwards trick-taking game.

36
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:06,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have to follow suit and literally everything's Trump except the suit that was led.

37
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:12,196
Speaker 0: So yeah It's like hearts, but you don't have to follow suit and everything's the Queen.

38
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:18,559
Speaker 0: Yep so yeah, but we'll talk about all those games in due course on various shows as we come up.

39
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,745
Speaker 0: and Yeah, we're back from PAX.

40
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:21,830
Speaker 0: I didn't die mountain biking.

41
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,540
Speaker 0: I actually only got a minor injury this year.

42
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:26,259
Speaker 0: Oh only a minor injury.

43
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:36,751
Speaker 0: so I realized something at doing this mountain biking again because basically there were two other people who were like pro at it and Some other people who said they'd mountain bike before.

44
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:43,050
Speaker 0: but I've realized that when most people say mountain biking What they imagine is something that is not mountain biking.

45
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,740
Speaker 0: They imagine riding a mountain bike in the woods.

46
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:50,640
Speaker 0: They imagine riding a hybrid bike in the woods.

47
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,109
Speaker 0: They imagine riding a mountain bike on a trail.

48
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,020
Speaker 0: some of them seem to just imagine riding a mountain bike.

49
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:59,634
Speaker 1: Mountain biking is not usually televised that often right?

50
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:06,153
Speaker 1: So people think like, you know Like well like biking on a mountain on a road is not mountain biking.

51
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:06,935
Speaker 1: That's road biking.

52
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:08,320
Speaker 1: You don't even use a mountain bike for that.

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,350
Speaker 1: Yep, you know the tour de France and the Tour de France.

54
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,820
Speaker 1: They go up mountains in the Alps that are way bigger than any mountain.

55
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,818
Speaker 1: You're going to mountain bike on and they're not using a mountain bike.

56
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:27,666
Speaker 0: Yep This is a good time but one person who was with us was like yeah mountain bike once or twice and then we get on the lift and he's like Why are we on a ski lift?

57
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,031
Speaker 0: and we're like, you're fucked dude.

58
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:31,060
Speaker 1: You have not mountain bike before apparently.

59
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,940
Speaker 0: So and then even in the forum, I was like yo does anyone mountain bike?

60
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,488
Speaker 0: I don't think I know anyone who mountain bikes.

61
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,937
Speaker 1: It's not really that common.

62
00:03:40,017 --> 00:03:48,380
Speaker 0: It's only common I think in places where like it is common Like if you live in a ski town in the summer people mountain bike because there's nothing else to do there.

63
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, lots of people have mountain bikes, but they're not.

64
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,819
Speaker 1: you know, actual mountain biking is not a common.

65
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:58,220
Speaker 0: But someone in the forum was like, well, why don't you do cyclocross cyclocross?

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,915
Speaker 1: It's not even remotely close to mountain bike and also does not look fun.

67
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:04,843
Speaker 0: I don't like Bicycle racing.

68
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:08,654
Speaker 0: that is primarily dependent upon your pure physical ability.

69
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:10,880
Speaker 0: So I actually do like for racing.

70
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,643
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

71
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:13,851
Speaker 1: I actually do think cyclocross looks fun.

72
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:16,982
Speaker 1: However, I'm not interested in racing I just want to.

73
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:22,600
Speaker 1: I just want a bike on a fun obstacle course without any, you know conditions of trying to win or anything.

74
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:27,760
Speaker 1: Yep, right That no one's doing cyclocross without the racing part.

75
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:29,707
Speaker 1: So that makes me not interested in Vikings.

76
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,228
Speaker 0: the opposite.

77
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,700
Speaker 0: Most people are just doing it for the thrill of like, what's the puzzle?

78
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,904
Speaker 0: How do I get down this trail?

79
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:35,867
Speaker 0: They're not racing like.

80
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,753
Speaker 0: there are people who race but it's flipped.

81
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:38,616
Speaker 0: They're the minority.

82
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:44,718
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but I've determined that I'm actually real good at mountain biking.

83
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:48,280
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Let's let's find a professional mountain biker and see what they have to say.

84
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:53,238
Speaker 0: Two of the people we were I was racing with we started kind of racing because they were pros like.

85
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,406
Speaker 1: therefore They get paid to mountain bike.

86
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:56,048
Speaker 1: That's their job.

87
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:56,991
Speaker 0: They compete.

88
00:04:57,132 --> 00:05:00,926
Speaker 0: one of them is an instructor like and Yeah, they're like.

89
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:07,080
Speaker 0: I'm good at it apparently But I don't think I could teach it because the last instruction I got was like a kid and I just kind of do it.

90
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,270
Speaker 0: I don't think about it that much.

91
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:15,720
Speaker 1: The only problem is Are you doing like the you know, dangerous deadly jumps like I see with GoPros on YouTube?

92
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,953
Speaker 0: I don't like jumping but even skiing I don't do jumps so much.

93
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:20,520
Speaker 0: I mostly focus on technical track.

94
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,325
Speaker 1: That's a pro people are doing.

95
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:27,500
Speaker 1: there's different kinds of even mountain riding on some really crazy narrow thing real fast narrow thing fast.

96
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,086
Speaker 0: It's real easy.

97
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:28,874
Speaker 0: That's called single track.

98
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,083
Speaker 0: That's what I did Like that's.

99
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,560
Speaker 0: I did that so much as you move a little bit to the side you die.

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,360
Speaker 0: Yeah I did that so much as a kid that that's second nature like I. actually I am more comfortable doing that.

101
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:41,474
Speaker 0: Then I am like going fast downhill on a road bike.

102
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:45,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, like yeah Well, you remember even you were on a nice road bike.

103
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:46,215
Speaker 0: we're going downhill.

104
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:47,360
Speaker 0: you were breaking right?

105
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,600
Speaker 0: Cuz it's scary to go that fast on a bike.

106
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,463
Speaker 1: I always break.

107
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:51,648
Speaker 1: I break more than everybody.

108
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:56,588
Speaker 1: during that I did the century and I realized like oh Everyone gets away from me on the downhill.

109
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,678
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm breaking way more than everybody.

110
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,038
Speaker 1: Yeah That makes a lot of sense.

111
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:05,340
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I didn't think I was slower than that guy.

112
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:08,239
Speaker 1: I guess he's just less afraid to go fast down the hill than I am.

113
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,740
Speaker 0: So I am less afraid of going fast downhill and a mountain bike than I am on a road bike.

114
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:14,864
Speaker 1: I mean, I just don't want it.

115
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:18,659
Speaker 1: There's a certain speed at which you know, I just don't want to go faster than that period.

116
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:26,340
Speaker 0: Yep also mountain biking you'll be going real fast and then it's like car racing where you Break real hard to get around a corner and then accelerate again.

117
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:33,623
Speaker 1: No I break way way way in advance and go around the corner nice and slow and then go fast again and with nice smooth Acceleration though.

118
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:34,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one thing though.

119
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:40,040
Speaker 1: I do not like accelerating or decelerating rapidly no matter what I will break a mile in fucking advance.

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,835
Speaker 0: Accelerated and decelerating is what I enjoy the most.

121
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:44,499
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

122
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,973
Speaker 1: That's why I don't go in your community.

123
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:49,200
Speaker 0: So how was that century?

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,374
Speaker 1: Basically, you wake up at the crackety crack crack at a crack crack acid on.

125
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go to Central Park So it's already putting some miles on.

126
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:00,075
Speaker 1: I almost got worried because I was.

127
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,838
Speaker 1: I'm like I want to.

128
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,371
Speaker 1: I don't want to go The long way over the Queen's borough.

129
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:16,756
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go over Randall's Island to get to the start The top of Central Park right and I'm like, all right, let's go there the the Randall's Island way and It's dark and I'm on Randall's Island and there's people on Randall's Island at 5 a.m I guess

130
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:17,579
Speaker 0: we're doing

131
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:17,740
Speaker 1: what?

132
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,726
Speaker 1: I don't fucking know.

133
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:19,776
Speaker 1: there were cars there and shit.

134
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:21,326
Speaker 0: Maybe I might be.

135
00:07:21,346 --> 00:07:21,748
Speaker 0: you know, what?

136
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:24,000
Speaker 0: actually it's probably kid baseball stuff.

137
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,671
Speaker 1: No, they were going to like, you know, the I think.

138
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:26,992
Speaker 1: so what?

139
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:32,552
Speaker 1: at least one person who's driving to the nut house I don't know if not has a derogatory term unrelatedly.

140
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,597
Speaker 0: Apparently there was a con.

141
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:34,480
Speaker 0: this was a FARC story.

142
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,887
Speaker 0: I was gonna use my thing today, but I didn't.

143
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:37,073
Speaker 0: on Randall's Island.

144
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:37,918
Speaker 0: There's concerts, right?

145
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:38,239
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

146
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:41,019
Speaker 0: So you can't bring liquor into those concerts.

147
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:58,800
Speaker 0: so this dude buried bottles of vodka on the island two weeks before a concert and Dug him up at the concert documented everything and they interviewed his friend and his friend said and I quote the man is a legend.

148
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:04,700
Speaker 1: I am against the drinking of poison, but that man is truly a legend.

149
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,011
Speaker 0: That is that is you respect the game like it is.

150
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,760
Speaker 1: Why did he not also bury weed?

151
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,487
Speaker 0: It's like if John wick was real.

152
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,960
Speaker 0: you don't respect killing killings bad.

153
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:22,333
Speaker 1: Why not also throw a gun down there, but you respect the craft of it Even if what they did is bad anyway, so and then at 6 a.m.

154
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:25,000
Speaker 1: They did some hoo-ha and then you started biking.

155
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:28,120
Speaker 1: You're basically just biking on New York City streets.

156
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:34,880
Speaker 1: There's no closed roads or anything unless you're doing the baby route and which means you start in Prospect Park And you just go fucking everywhere.

157
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,639
Speaker 1: Right you go down.

158
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,456
Speaker 1: You go down you go over the Brooklyn Bridge early enough in the morning that it's.

159
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:44,443
Speaker 1: there's no one in your way You know.

160
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,490
Speaker 1: you go over down Rockaway.

161
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,715
Speaker 1: You're going past the beach.

162
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:56,320
Speaker 1: He's going fucking everywhere Right way out East way north of the frogs neck And then you get back to Astoria Park.

163
00:08:56,461 --> 00:09:04,305
Speaker 1: It's like oh you think you're going back to Manhattan knows you go all the way to the Bronx past the Botanical Garden And then all the way ass back down And then it's over which

164
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:08,364
Speaker 0: makes it when I think about it like I do like there's a 50-ish 50-60 mile ride.

165
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:09,708
Speaker 0: that I do kind of often.

166
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:16,253
Speaker 0: that's basically all the way down to Rockaway all the way across and then back around The long way mm-hmm, so that's already a long way.

167
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:17,680
Speaker 0: I had 40 more miles to that.

168
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:22,547
Speaker 1: So first of all even though the road is not closed You're with a bunch of people like.

169
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:32,340
Speaker 1: I was worried that like because it's so long and there wasn't that many people doing it I might end up alone and lost yeah, but No, I was with a bunch of people pretty much the whole time.

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,245
Speaker 1: There was always people.

171
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:37,329
Speaker 1: so you know and when you're riding with the people I guess you get this sort of added.

172
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:44,060
Speaker 1: you could you know safety benefit But some drunk driver hit people at like 8 in the morning or something whoa not where I was.

173
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,959
Speaker 1: Also There's a bunch of rest stops So you can all you can stop and get bananas and water and food.

174
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,189
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of the supported ride.

175
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:55,394
Speaker 1: watermelon there was.

176
00:09:55,675 --> 00:10:03,900
Speaker 1: watermelon was excellent But there was one rest stop the Throgs Neck one that was you know for 100 mile people only and that one was no good.

177
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,278
Speaker 1: They had one kind of Clif Bar and that was it.

178
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,820
Speaker 1: I didn't have fruit they had water and there's one kind of Clif Bar and nothing else.

179
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:11,703
Speaker 1: It's just like really.

180
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:15,299
Speaker 1: that's a shame and that was what I needed it the most because I was feeling like the worst around.

181
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:27,997
Speaker 1: then right, but then Once we started going towards Astoria, which was a bad easy ride because it was such a familiar ride I like I got another wind and then I was like we the whole rest of the time.

182
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:28,760
Speaker 1: I was like whatever.

183
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:34,904
Speaker 1: I was getting slow out when I was out east you know like the Alipon Park And you know such.

184
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:36,952
Speaker 1: but then once after that it was.

185
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,120
Speaker 1: it was easy goings no problems.

186
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:45,066
Speaker 1: There were a few basically because there's no There's not a whole lot of markings.

187
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:51,999
Speaker 1: like basically someone goes around spray-painting on the street in yellow the letter C with an arrow And you can also get the q-sheet.

188
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,055
Speaker 1: But the app to like load the GPS data in is like money every month.

189
00:10:56,075 --> 00:10:57,380
Speaker 1: so no one's paying for that shit, right?

190
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,719
Speaker 1: So if you're not like reading the q-sheet there were a few times where we like missed a turn and had to turn around again.

191
00:11:04,483 --> 00:11:13,731
Speaker 1: One time I was with a whole bunch of people and we all went the wrong way That's the worst and one guy and then someone straightened us out And the whole group got back on track.

192
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,920
Speaker 1: there was a couple parts that were real bad.

193
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:26,472
Speaker 1: We were next to a highway and the path for biking that was next to the highway was like blocked by Construction and it's like didn't someone just make this route?

194
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,040
Speaker 1: did this construction show up yesterday?

195
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,745
Speaker 1: So we had to be York.

196
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:30,488
Speaker 0: it probably did.

197
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:37,967
Speaker 1: we had to throw our bikes over the guardrail walk on the Shoulder of the highway and then throw our bikes back over the guardrail.

198
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:39,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was real bad.

199
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:42,709
Speaker 1: No, I think there might have been another spot.

200
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,236
Speaker 1: That was iffy like that.

201
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:45,000
Speaker 1: That was no good.

202
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:50,100
Speaker 0: So one of our mountain bike routes We actually we get to a spot and on the ski resort where we're like mountain biking through the woods.

203
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:53,840
Speaker 0: There was construction and the trail we tried to get to it was closed.

204
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:56,660
Speaker 0: So we had to go down a regular road instead like a dirt road.

205
00:11:57,102 --> 00:12:00,139
Speaker 0: That is way more dangerous than just biking through the like woods.

206
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:01,463
Speaker 1: But yeah, there was.

207
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:02,968
Speaker 1: no I mean cuz you're in New York City.

208
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:05,876
Speaker 1: there there were no hills that were significant.

209
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,059
Speaker 1: worry, right?

210
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:16,400
Speaker 1: And the thing is it's like the funniest part was like after we finished We're at the north of Central Park and I got to go home and it's like oh, how do we get home?

211
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:19,960
Speaker 1: And there's like that's the hill at the back of Central Park is right there.

212
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,752
Speaker 1: Already biked over a hundred miles and to go home.

213
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28,844
Speaker 1: I gotta go of another stupid hill Right and it's like.

214
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,469
Speaker 1: but then I was.

215
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:34,180
Speaker 1: I was guess I was still had that other wind so it wasn't a problem.

216
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:40,253
Speaker 1: But it's like it really puts into perspective Like normally just go up that hill no problem.

217
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:47,779
Speaker 1: and there's these tourists struggling Yeah, but it's like I already did a hundred miles and this tourist struggling and I'm flying past them.

218
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:51,730
Speaker 0: That's like a situation like on the way to packs Meanwhile my 50-pound bag.

219
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,639
Speaker 1: But meanwhile when I'm doing the century the the pro lance armstrong type people are pushing past you.

220
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:07,299
Speaker 1: We're flying past me like whoosh and I fly past this tourist and it's like wow the like amount of you know skill disparity of biking is so wide.

221
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:09,509
Speaker 1: It's so yeah.

222
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:11,141
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not even gonna say skill You know what?

223
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:11,442
Speaker 0: It is.

224
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:16,198
Speaker 1: Most people are not athletic at all or like not knowing how to use a gear.

225
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,325
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah That's it.

226
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,195
Speaker 0: That's who?

227
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:28,740
Speaker 0: See at least on the mountain bike my smallest gear my front gear There's only one and it's tiny and my biggest gear in the back is bigger than the biggest gear on my current bike in the front.

228
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:42,250
Speaker 1: But I think the thing is if you wanna, you know See a whole lot of New York City and bike a whole lot of New York City In a way that is generally safer than doing it on your own with a lot of rest stops and comfort And also bike a whole lot in one day.

229
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,721
Speaker 1: We started 6 a.m We finished it like 5.

230
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:50,320
Speaker 1: I got home more like 5 36 because you know, I waited at the end hung out and then biked home, right?

231
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're near New York City.

232
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,519
Speaker 1: I don't know if I traveled in New York to do this.

233
00:13:55,883 --> 00:14:02,594
Speaker 1: you know, it's worth it, but It's gonna take you longer than doing a century somewhere else because of all the red lights and stuff.

234
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:07,294
Speaker 1: if we did the hundred miles Somewhere else it would have been way faster without red lights.

235
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,880
Speaker 1: Of course the hundred miles But it's less hilly because it's New York.

236
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,406
Speaker 1: There were only like a couple hill situations And they weren't really.

237
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:20,167
Speaker 0: that's the trouble that we could probably do the century on the Harlan Valley rail ride But that's more mountain mountain.

238
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,411
Speaker 1: Well, I think I could do.

239
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,276
Speaker 1: I could almost definitely do the leg.

240
00:14:23,316 --> 00:14:24,560
Speaker 1: They have a leg saving version.

241
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could definitely do that.

242
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:27,091
Speaker 0: I don't feel like that's the one I did.

243
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,260
Speaker 1: It only has two hills, right?

244
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,182
Speaker 1: Where's the one?

245
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,092
Speaker 1: we'd be 70 we did last year.

246
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,418
Speaker 1: this year had one hill.

247
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:41,945
Speaker 0: I remember all the people who who got kicked out of the century and had to go like on the play route at the end Cuz I was talking to a bunch of them.

248
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 0: every everyone I met who got kicked out was doing the leg saver.

249
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,832
Speaker 0: I didn't meet anyone got kicked out.

250
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:47,559
Speaker 0: who did the real one?

251
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,820
Speaker 1: I think no one does the real one unless they're you know, definitely for sure Pro, right?

252
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,719
Speaker 0: Shane wants to know how sore you are you sore?

253
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:55,785
Speaker 1: Not really.

254
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:57,073
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I don't.

255
00:14:57,214 --> 00:15:01,390
Speaker 1: when I do athletic activities that goes way slow it does.

256
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:08,106
Speaker 1: the only athletic activity I do is biking and I don't ever Exert myself to like.

257
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:10,597
Speaker 1: if it's like, you know rim like huffin puffin, right?

258
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:11,400
Speaker 0: I like to go fast.

259
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,083
Speaker 1: He's trying.

260
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:15,076
Speaker 1: he's trying hard to act to try to go fast.

261
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:24,556
Speaker 1: So pedal harder Yeah, whereas I'm always comfortable if I'm not comfortable I try less like I'll go in the lower gear and go doo doo doo doo doo doo doo just so.

262
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:27,044
Speaker 1: I'm always like ah At all times.

263
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,268
Speaker 1: I'm never huffin and puffin.

264
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:29,893
Speaker 0: I'm trying to beat the times.

265
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:32,180
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, I don't pay attention to Strava times.

266
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,920
Speaker 1: I push record when I start and I don't look at again till I'm done just to record the route.

267
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,330
Speaker 1: I don't care about that.

268
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:44,319
Speaker 1: I don't even know how many trophies I got But I guess you know, you still biked a hundred miles like the top of my thighs.

269
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:56,711
Speaker 1: We're like, obviously Yes it's a little hard whenever I but even if I bike less than that, you know, it's hard to walk up and downstairs for a little while and That's about it.

270
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,821
Speaker 1: yeah,

271
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:06,626
Speaker 0: we're back from packs and expect like ten different shows of reviews of everything and The first news we got because this

272
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:11,885
Speaker 1: is probably the we're gonna hit another packs before we run out of chose from Yeah from this bag unplugged

Speaker 0: if I hadn't changed jobs I would have been going to it, but I'm not going now.

278
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:20,999
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have a plane ticket, right?

279
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,401
Speaker 1: Do you?

280
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:24,339
Speaker 0: I don't have a I don't have a free pass to go to it.

281
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,732
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying you sure you didn't spend money on a plane ticket.

282
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,059
Speaker 1: That's not being canceled or something.

283
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,063
Speaker 0: No No, I do anything like that.

284
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:29,465
Speaker 1: Okay.

285
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:35,670
Speaker 0: So while we were at packs this new like I saw Rumblings of this news mostly through people.

286
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:43,595
Speaker 0: It's not really a news so much as it's a Conversation that has happened before was rekindled for various reasons, right?

287
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:45,260
Speaker 1: So basically this is platforming game.

288
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,460
Speaker 1: That's I don't know if it's a good platforming game.

289
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,380
Speaker 1: I haven't played it but I've seen it for quite a while.

290
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,320
Speaker 0: I played a demo of it.

291
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,840
Speaker 0: The only thing I'll say is that it looks rolls felt really good, right?

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,365
Speaker 0: They felt super meat boy tight.

293
00:16:55,385 --> 00:17:01,935
Speaker 1: the visuals of this platforming game look like an old-school Mickey Mouse cartoon Which is an aesthetic that is down my alley.

294
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:02,660
Speaker 1: I love that shit.

295
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:07,980
Speaker 1: So that makes me want to at least play a demo of this game if not pay for it and play it for real.

296
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:12,380
Speaker 1: But regardless there's a platforming game that apparently has some difficulty to it.

297
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,719
Speaker 1: It is not easy and there was a reviewer who was playing the game and they suck.

298
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,631
Speaker 0: They suck so bad.

299
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:22,159
Speaker 0: Oh did they suck?

300
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,222
Speaker 1: They sucked.

301
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:32,000
Speaker 1: so now that that's not news the gaming community was like Hey, are you qualified to fucking review this game if you suck so much?

302
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,550
Speaker 0: Real clear being good.

303
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,320
Speaker 1: Are you qualified to review a car?

304
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,855
Speaker 1: If you suck at driving being are you qualified to review a guitar?

305
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't play it.

306
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,175
Speaker 0: Well, so the probably games being good at games does not know.

307
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:47,640
Speaker 0: it's not the important skill.

308
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,567
Speaker 0: Having knowledge about games is the important skill.

309
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:51,369
Speaker 1: That is correct.

310
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,993
Speaker 0: So I'm not mad.

311
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,720
Speaker 0: like I've reviewed board gauge of steam where.

312
00:17:56,661 --> 00:18:00,114
Speaker 0: Imagine if there was video of us playing age of steam before we reviewed it.

313
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:01,760
Speaker 0: that game kicked our asses.

314
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:08,491
Speaker 1: It sure did and I don't think I'm ever going to become good at age of steam But we knew the history of some train games at that.

315
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:08,792
Speaker 0: Yes.

316
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:11,660
Speaker 1: I can understand age of steam without being good at it.

317
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,203
Speaker 1: I can understand go without being good at it because I have a knowledge of games qualification.

318
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:25,958
Speaker 1: the number one qualification for reviewing things it with text is writing and the number one qualification For reviewing things with words is eloquence.

319
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,830
Speaker 1: And the number two qualification is knowledge.

320
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,552
Speaker 0: Cisco.

321
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:33,040
Speaker 0: a bird did not have the skills to make movies.

322
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:33,884
Speaker 1: No, they didn't.

323
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,860
Speaker 1: they knew what made movies good and Ebert tried.

324
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:41,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I think Hebrew is the one who tried and did not make a good movie, right?

325
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,960
Speaker 1: But it's like I can't design anything for shit.

326
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:53,218
Speaker 1: But at work I can sit there and look at websites and I can't really you know I can say the font is wrong, even though I couldn't tell you what font is right.

327
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:55,045
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, now we're.

328
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:58,599
Speaker 0: so I don't want to get too deep into this because I feel like there's a whole show here.

329
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is definitely a whole show about this thing.

330
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:05,000
Speaker 1: We will make the next Tuesday show all about this unless something else comes up.

331
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I just wanted to get that point across.

332
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:10,460
Speaker 0: that like, you know, I feel like the way back.

333
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,216
Speaker 1: There was a dude who reviewed something for Kotaku and like he hadn't played doom and it's like.

334
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:23,700
Speaker 1: and I actually met him at PAX And asked him about it and he was like, yeah people tried to get me to do Z doom and I couldn't make it work.

335
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:25,867
Speaker 1: And I was like that is a problem.

336
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you don't you had you hadn't?

337
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:28,456
Speaker 1: it's like.

338
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:29,760
Speaker 1: it's okay to suck at doom.

339
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:33,140
Speaker 1: I'm not expecting you to like beat doom on nightmare, right?

340
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:42,558
Speaker 1: But if you haven't played doom and you can't even get it to work I think that makes you unqualified to at least review FPS is on the PC.

341
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:51,040
Speaker 0: now to be fair There is a space in general media review and critique for the naive commentary versus the expert commentary versus the academic.

342
00:19:51,180 --> 00:20:01,680
Speaker 1: Obviously if you're someone who's an expert platformer your review of this coming from even you know A great reviewer who doesn't a skilled platformer is not going to be good.

343
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,689
Speaker 1: That can help you because there's that's pretty.

344
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,000
Speaker 1: imagine the review looking for what you're looking for.

345
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:12,220
Speaker 0: Imagine the review of the unmodified original tumbleseed by someone who is an ice cold beer champion.

346
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:18,818
Speaker 0: Exactly that review would be very different and probably just as useless as someone who had never heard of ice cold beer.

347
00:20:18,878 --> 00:20:24,880
Speaker 1: that being said A good reviewer knows all their possible audience and can write to the whole.

348
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:27,991
Speaker 1: You know multiple audiences such that no matter who's reading it.

349
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,300
Speaker 1: They'll be able to figure out if it's for them or not.

350
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:40,835
Speaker 0: It was or was not for the review But while simultaneously being very upfront and clear about where their review was coming from and what they know and don't know and what skills They have or don't have.

351
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,419
Speaker 1: yes But the point is you don't need.

352
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:45,573
Speaker 1: Skill is not as important as knowledge and writing skill.

353
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:49,227
Speaker 1: game skill is like the third thing Even that it might be lower than that.

354
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:54,463
Speaker 0: And I think most of the people who are making a big ruckus about this are Gomergate shitheads.

355
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:56,729
Speaker 0: Well, I was the impression I got.

356
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,206
Speaker 1: I think I empathize with them in the same way as when I watch someone in the Omega thon.

357
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,655
Speaker 1: right is like if you're You know.

358
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,920
Speaker 1: It's like if I could play Mario and I'm watching someone else play Mario and they hit the first Goomba and they don't get better.

359
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,208
Speaker 1: I feel this like frustration like why you know better Why you know improve.

360
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:25,782
Speaker 1: I must help you girl right and that You know, you might you know, express this anger by saying well, you're unqualified to be a reviewer Right.

361
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:27,166
Speaker 0: No, you're unqualified to be an omega.

362
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:37,554
Speaker 1: Not sure but it's like, you know how you express that anger might be with false Insulting statements or who knows how but I also have those feelings when I see someone.

363
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:44,072
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I feel like most of the Rabid angry response to this was the gaming.

364
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:46,300
Speaker 0: journalism must be objective types.

365
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:46,942
Speaker 0: Which is this?

366
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:51,940
Speaker 0: all other ballgame of the Venn diagram, which you can be objective while being shitty.

367
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:59,078
Speaker 0: It's oh, yeah But the Venn diagram between people who say those keywords and people are a Gomer gator shitheads is nearly a circle.

368
00:21:59,098 --> 00:21:59,479
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

369
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:06,680
Speaker 0: So in some other news Metroid Samus returns comes out what real soon like a couple days, right?

370
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:08,550
Speaker 1: I think we talked about this.

371
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,340
Speaker 1: when they announced it was I farted real bad.

372
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:20,940
Speaker 1: I'm sorry but they're basically they're remade Metroid 2 which is a game that there was a fan remake of because the game at Metroid 2 if you don't know is a Game Boy game only right?

373
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:22,384
Speaker 1: That was it.

374
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:23,429
Speaker 1: There was no.

375
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:28,030
Speaker 1: I guess it was also for the Super Game Boy Technically speaking like the old Mario Land.

376
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, I led one.

377
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,440
Speaker 1: Yes like that, right?

378
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:53,640
Speaker 1: So if you played it on the Super Game Boy It had better colors and it I don't remember exactly it may have been re-released on a DX cartridge Which meant it has slightly better colors if you played it on a Game Boy color But could still be played on a regular Game Boy in black and white As well as Super Game Boy and I guess could also be played in a GBA with Game Boy color colors.

379
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:54,647
Speaker 1: but that was it.

380
00:22:54,828 --> 00:23:05,760
Speaker 1: it was never released anything else and Most a lot of people have access to play Metroid 1 because that game was re-released in virtual consoles and things Right and people can obviously play Super Metroid very easily.

381
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:15,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Metroid 2 has been hard to play without an emulator and now it's finally, you know Metroid zero mission came out for GBA and stuff right there remakes.

382
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,468
Speaker 1: Metroid 2 is not remade so people don't know.

383
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:29,700
Speaker 1: in Metroid 1 Samus goes to planet Zeebs where the space pirates are Using Metroids to conduct evil experiments and whatnot, you know You don't see any Metroids until basically the end of the game, right?

384
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,820
Speaker 1: Because that's in the mother brain secret lab is where the Metroids are.

385
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,462
Speaker 1: It's yeah, right.

386
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:41,000
Speaker 1: and then in Metroid Super Metroid the game starts and it's like the last Metroid is in captivity.

387
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:43,008
Speaker 1: The galaxy is at peace, right?

388
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,423
Speaker 1: It's like what happened in Metroid 2.

389
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:58,423
Speaker 1: Well, every Metroid except for the last one Was in captivity because of what happens in Metroid 2. right in Metroid 2 Samus goes to the homeworld of Metroids and Fucking murders.

390
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:06,731
Speaker 1: all spoilers all the Metroids except one and that is Metroid 2 and a lot of people have missed out on that shit because it's an original Gameboy game.

391
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:11,677
Speaker 0: now, this is a Remake meaning it is very different from Metroid 2. it is.

392
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:17,856
Speaker 1: It is a bionic commando rearmed or maybe even more than that, but it is still.

393
00:24:18,096 --> 00:24:21,550
Speaker 1: go to planet sr 388 and kill all the Metroids.

394
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:22,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the biggest difference is.

395
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:23,580
Speaker 0: I haven't played it yet.

396
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,069
Speaker 0: I didn't get a review copy or anything.

397
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,801
Speaker 0: It's a much more modern game, but I don't know.

398
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:30,570
Speaker 0: cuz you have three you have fine-grain aiming.

399
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:32,276
Speaker 0: Yep, which was not a thing.

400
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:39,758
Speaker 0: No old days You just had eight-way aiming and there's this weird sort of like Counter-attack system like a fighting game.

401
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:42,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an action platformer.

402
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the kind of thing that's in Metroid games.

403
00:24:44,457 --> 00:24:48,251
Speaker 0: I'm very curious How much like a Metroid game it'll feel.

404
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,940
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it'll be a very similar map.

405
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:56,197
Speaker 1: You know a very similar enemy location the same story same general deal, right?

406
00:24:56,438 --> 00:25:01,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know I don't trust reviews really but it's getting good reviews, but I heard getting very good reviews.

407
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,989
Speaker 1: I heard the Pete the studio that made.

408
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,240
Speaker 1: it has not had a good track record, but it doesn't matter.

409
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,903
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

410
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:08,273
Speaker 1: I can finally play Metroid 2 in a tolerable fashion.

411
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:10,000
Speaker 1: the fan remake got shut down.

412
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,540
Speaker 1: This is your chance because even if you do emulate the original Metroid 2, it's not the greatest experience.

413
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,689
Speaker 1: But you still want to get the whole Metroid experience.

414
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:19,633
Speaker 1: It's still a great game.

415
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:21,199
Speaker 1: So I think this is gonna be good.

416
00:25:21,906 --> 00:25:22,554
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play it.

417
00:25:22,777 --> 00:25:31,349
Speaker 0: Yep So in some other news while I was gone at PAX the season of overwatch ended new season began and all that nonsense They added.

418
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,320
Speaker 0: because they keep adding modes.

419
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:36,713
Speaker 0: But if you haven't played overwatch, it has like the regular quick play.

420
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:38,839
Speaker 0: play the normal game and it doesn't matter for fun.

421
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:47,954
Speaker 0: It has competitive which is serious and ranked and it has the arcade where basically that Replaces the mods that would be in the old FPS.

422
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:49,180
Speaker 0: is that people in hopes themselves?

423
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:52,650
Speaker 0: But they actually do game design on the mods and change them.

424
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,939
Speaker 0: so like the the arcade rotates in these game modes and A lot of them are pretty great.

425
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,431
Speaker 0: But they added something that I didn't think they would actually add.

426
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:04,080
Speaker 0: they actually added straight-up deathmatch.

427
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:08,899
Speaker 0: Eight people pick a character fucking frags win.

428
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,890
Speaker 1: Is there a character that's OP in deathmatch?

429
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,520
Speaker 1: So because you're not trying to area control or anything.

430
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:20,040
Speaker 0: So I've noticed that I played like 10 or 15 games of it last night just to see so I could talk about it.

431
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:25,991
Speaker 0: It seems like people who are Exceptionally good snipers are invincible and win all the time.

432
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:26,994
Speaker 1: that makes sense.

433
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:32,772
Speaker 0: people who are not exceptional snipers But who choose a sniper are garbage worthless and get like zero kills.

434
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:33,514
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

435
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:34,377
Speaker 1: That's what's true.

436
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:36,946
Speaker 0: for FPS junk rat There's a man equivalent.

437
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:40,560
Speaker 0: the throw bombs everywhere seems to win most games.

438
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:43,124
Speaker 1: Really yeah Interesting.

439
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:50,480
Speaker 1: I noticed that and that is not typical of all the sniper thing You just said it's not true since they've made a sniper rifle in an FPS.

440
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,900
Speaker 1: So it kind of makes sense because when I buy the demo man thing, it's not new.

441
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:05,790
Speaker 0: So when I played and that is new the equivalent of the demo man back in like weapons factory and we played in deathmatch modes I would just spam common areas and people would just die.

442
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:09,057
Speaker 1: You think it's because it's low skill people.

443
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:10,622
Speaker 1: well, but you think the dough.

444
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:11,264
Speaker 1: I think it's good.

445
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:13,049
Speaker 0: I kill people spamming.

446
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:16,270
Speaker 1: Right, but it say it's low skill people walking into this.

447
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:21,790
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah If it was a game of all high skill people that spamming tactic wouldn't be worth anything because no one would go in there.

448
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:32,170
Speaker 0: Farah a flying rocket marine doesn't seem to do so well because she gets snapped out of the sky all the time Because it's not as fast as the self healers do pretty well like people who can heal themselves.

449
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,422
Speaker 0: But uh, I I've won like one one.

450
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,389
Speaker 1: give up less frags that way even if you get less.

451
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:42,730
Speaker 0: for yeah I won one of them that I played and I want a hard and the one I won.

452
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:52,059
Speaker 0: I Picked the character who can leave six little centuries around and I made death rooms and people just walked into them and died similar to the demo man strategy of spamming.

453
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,857
Speaker 0: and when I did that people were Man, it's not you're so overpowered man.

454
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:02,933
Speaker 0: Stop being so cheap you cheap piece of shit and I won Eat it.

455
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:06,890
Speaker 0: and also when someone else tried to do the same thing, it's trivial to counters.

456
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:08,482
Speaker 0: I don't know what these kids are complaining about.

457
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:09,208
Speaker 1: They said

458
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:28,450
Speaker 0: yeah But I'm very happy that the overwatch team is continuing to invest significant design resources in the like weird mod arcade because they keep changing these modes like they had a Lockout mode where it's like two teams and you fight to the death over and over again.

459
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,935
Speaker 0: There's all this stuff in there.

460
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:34,210
Speaker 0: they keep modifying the rules of that mode to make it fairer and more interesting.

461
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,579
Speaker 1: This is the thing that I find the most interesting right?

462
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:43,930
Speaker 1: Is that you know, forgive my heart stone They keep investing in it and it's like well, yeah, cuz if you play you gotta keep spending more fucking money.

463
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but overwatch get me wrong is $50 once and that's it.

464
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:48,926
Speaker 1: You get everything for.

465
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:53,706
Speaker 1: you can buy Packages of loot boxes, but those are like skins and shit.

466
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:56,484
Speaker 0: Yeah People appear to buy them.

467
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:59,370
Speaker 0: Okay I mean I got like I like.

468
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:01,234
Speaker 0: I'd give them to you.

469
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:02,319
Speaker 0: I forgot about those.

470
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,344
Speaker 0: I'd give them to you.

471
00:29:03,364 --> 00:29:03,444
Speaker 0: good.

472
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:04,630
Speaker 0: You can't trade them.

473
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,103
Speaker 0: They're just in my account not opening up.

474
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,495
Speaker 1: I Did forget about those.

475
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:12,008
Speaker 1: All right, so that's why they continue to invest in the game.

476
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:17,446
Speaker 0: also It appears that there is a constant like new players joining the game.

477
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:18,149
Speaker 0: You got to have a.

478
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:19,510
Speaker 1: no Yeah, but I'm just you know.

479
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,458
Speaker 1: I'm just wondering how long that can't last forever.

480
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:24,470
Speaker 1: the new player part you the skin part is what keeps it going like dota.

481
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:28,484
Speaker 0: Yep, right the competitive aspect might keep a core going forever.

482
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,370
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike style and the eSports can write.

483
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:37,408
Speaker 1: But as long as that as long as the eSports continues people have an interest in playing and competing and I guess some of those people like skins.

484
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:38,358
Speaker 0: so think of this though.

485
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:42,237
Speaker 0: remember tribes to even Counter-Strike had the issue.

486
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:53,810
Speaker 0: that was both a positive and a negative for people can make mods and like there was an error when even When I tried to play Counter-Strike half the servers were like this World of Warcraft like the bullshittiest of bullshit mods.

487
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:59,888
Speaker 0: And yet people want that stuff but fans who make mods tend to be garbage at it.

488
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:03,075
Speaker 0: So Blizzard Realized what to do.

489
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,868
Speaker 0: They make all the crazy mods, but they make them good.

490
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,120
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, let me tell you that I read the story.

491
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,050
Speaker 1: Do you read the story about the pub G guy how it happened?

492
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:10,960
Speaker 0: No, I did not.

493
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:11,569
Speaker 1: I'll tell you that.

494
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,220
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz I'm gonna play pub G so we can talk about it.

495
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,770
Speaker 1: It's the pub G seems like this unavoidable thing.

496
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:18,887
Speaker 1: I don't want to do it.

497
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:23,869
Speaker 1: It's just so it but it seems like I got to do it just because it's so big.

498
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:27,646
Speaker 1: You see anything we talked about when like everyone's talking about my house Akai time.

499
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:34,377
Speaker 1: I'm a house Akai tie Magica, I guess if you know everyone's talking about this my little pony I guess we got to go see what the deal is.

500
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:39,909
Speaker 1: Well pub G is at that level where it's like, alright I guess we still might not get the best game.

501
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,837
Speaker 0: I guess we got to see what the deal is.

502
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:44,870
Speaker 0: stories that are coming out of it are pretty good.

503
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,313
Speaker 1: I'm still.

504
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:47,289
Speaker 1: I need to find the tutorial how to mute everyone though.

505
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:55,469
Speaker 1: Yeah Someone said somebody send me the tutorial and had a mute everyone in pub G and then maybe we'll try it out.

506
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:56,754
Speaker 0: We should team up.

507
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:58,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sounds good.

508
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,684
Speaker 0: 50% chance of winning.

509
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:01,490
Speaker 1: Well, how do we know if we found each other?

510
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,232
Speaker 0: I don't know.

511
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,122
Speaker 0: I mean, I barely know how the game works.

512
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:05,408
Speaker 1: I can explain it to you after.

513
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,795
Speaker 0: I mean I know the gist of it.

514
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:08,023
Speaker 1: I actually I did a lot.

515
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,270
Speaker 1: I did a ton of research on it.

516
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:09,957
Speaker 1: I just haven't played it.

517
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:10,766
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna play it.

518
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:12,875
Speaker 1: You should probably do that.

519
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:15,024
Speaker 1: We should probably combine the research in the playing.

520
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:15,647
Speaker 1: Yeah.

521
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:26,110
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway things of the day, so what do you got?

522
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:32,956
Speaker 1: So someone posted this is their thing of the day in our forum which where you should go to see things like this And I thought it was so good.

523
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,784
Speaker 1: I'll steal it and make it my thing of the day.

524
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:35,587
Speaker 1: It's real good.

525
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:39,620
Speaker 1: So this is B2k balls big adventure part 2.

526
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,472
Speaker 1: I presume there's a part 1. who knows if there's a part 3?

527
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:44,578
Speaker 1: It seems like it's from a Japanese television show.

528
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,110
Speaker 1: Perhaps a children's Japanese television show would be my guess.

529
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:55,530
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's in the same universe as tumbleseed and Yeah Pythagoras Ouichi, right?

530
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,653
Speaker 1: so what the deal is?

531
00:31:56,733 --> 00:32:10,867
Speaker 1: it's basically sort of a Rube Goldberg machine that is telling a story about B2k ball who's a character who is a ball and It's like usually you see a Rope Goldberg machine and it has to be like an impressive machine to like.

532
00:32:10,928 --> 00:32:16,183
Speaker 1: really, you know Impress you but this one because they incorporate a story into it.

533
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:26,899
Speaker 1: It really gives a lot of life And I guess whimsy to what's otherwise just a pretty good Rube Goldberg machine.

534
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:36,668
Speaker 1: This is real good yeah, so this is a a video that brings joy and happiness to the world and therefore you should watch it.

535
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:42,550
Speaker 0: so We're old enough to where I went to LAN parties as a kid meaning I took my computer.

536
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:52,494
Speaker 0: I took a 19 inch C a Pentium 2 computer my Pentium 2 with 200 megahertz yep, and a 19 inch.

537
00:32:52,735 --> 00:32:56,546
Speaker 1: how many how many how many megabytes of RAM did that computer have?

538
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:58,850
Speaker 1: it had 32?

539
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,414
Speaker 0: I think it only had 16.

540
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:03,871
Speaker 0: I think I upgraded it at one point Megabytes.

541
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:05,858
Speaker 0: Oh, right and I had.

542
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,864
Speaker 0: I bought a really good sound card.

543
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:11,177
Speaker 1: It had a floppy drive Yeah, but it only.

544
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:19,829
Speaker 0: it only had the three and a quarter not that not the five and a half But I remember sitting in a car with my giant CRT in my lap.

545
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,718
Speaker 1: LCD monitors did not exist.

546
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:26,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not even like existed, but we're good for gaming did not.

547
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,796
Speaker 0: Yet now this picture is from way later than that But it is.

548
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:37,087
Speaker 1: this is when we were in perhaps college the early 2000s.

549
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:44,570
Speaker 0: You see a primitive LCD that probably does not have a sufficient refresh rate to actually play games.

550
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:48,281
Speaker 0: You see old counter-strike on a CRT.

551
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,427
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm real counter-strike.

552
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,816
Speaker 1: the guy I played And more.

553
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:55,228
Speaker 0: this picture is obviously taken with a non digital camera.

554
00:33:55,248 --> 00:34:01,150
Speaker 1: it appears Oh, yeah, and or a really shitty digital camera that used floppy disks for its storage.

555
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:08,364
Speaker 0: We had one of those and there's a kid duct-taped Hanging from the ceiling playing a game on his computer.

556
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:10,053
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's the.

557
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,643
Speaker 0: this is my thing of the day because some reporters.

558
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:14,590
Speaker 0: basically this picture is kind of famous.

559
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,922
Speaker 0: I could see it off and on.

560
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:22,770
Speaker 0: I've seen this Blessed image before someone tracked these kids down and figured out exactly what happened.

561
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:24,757
Speaker 0: All right, he was on the ceiling.

562
00:34:24,777 --> 00:34:25,742
Speaker 0: Where are they now?

563
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:26,585
Speaker 0: How did this?

564
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:26,846
Speaker 0: is a?

565
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:27,650
Speaker 0: where are they now?

566
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:30,370
Speaker 0: This was a the the kid on the ceiling.

567
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:36,889
Speaker 0: That was the second attempt because the first attempt almost ended in loss of limbs due to loss of blood flow to said limbs.

568
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that's not an easy.

569
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:38,536
Speaker 1: you got it.

570
00:34:38,617 --> 00:34:41,449
Speaker 1: You know, you're not gonna figure that out in the first attempt, right?

571
00:34:41,571 --> 00:34:44,070
Speaker 1: It's a learning experience a little trial and error going on.

572
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:56,358
Speaker 0: I love when there is a weird like Widely known image on the internet and someone goes and figures out the story behind it because those stories are often Way more interesting than you'd expect.

573
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:58,225
Speaker 1: I mean, we know the story of the goat see guy, right?

574
00:34:58,627 --> 00:34:59,370
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, we do.

575
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:00,192
Speaker 0: I know.

576
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:01,995
Speaker 0: actually I know the story of a couple images.

577
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:05,269
Speaker 0: I won't share cuz I was there and I've for that.

578
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:13,075
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna ever talk about them because I do not want the Internet's baleful gaze to find the people that were involved For obvious reasons.

579
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:16,070
Speaker 0: if you know what those images were what images are you talking about?

580
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,680
Speaker 0: You know the the kid you won the prize that image The mentally challenged kid getting an award.

581
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:24,749
Speaker 0: I know the names of everyone in that image.

582

583
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:33,729
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pull it up here cuz I'm on the stream and I just don't want anyone to find these kids.

584
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:36,356
Speaker 0: But yeah, they're.

585
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:46,809
Speaker 0: not only does this reporting find all the people involved in that image, but it finds additional images From that event from other angles.

586
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,997
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, this is pretty cool.

594
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:02,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, that image is not that popular.

595
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,350

Speaker 0: like old wizards Enjoyed gaming the good days.

600
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,589
Speaker 0: my land party days were way before this image was taken.

601
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:31,374
Speaker 0: To put it in perspective Play counter-strike.

602
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:32,096
Speaker 1: You had to play doom.

603
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:32,858
Speaker 1: And yeah, I liked it.

604
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,847

Speaker 1: I'm basically like 40% done with his book.

613
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:00,129
Speaker 0: I read the first chapter and I like it a lot.

614
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:07,150
Speaker 0: You haven't even seen the second planet there on reminds me of that planet at the end of player of game.

615
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,110
Speaker 1: That's also the first thing that I thought of when I thought of planets.

616
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,503
Speaker 0: You don't want to live that planet at the end of player of games.

617
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:15,370
Speaker 0: Is it a plus planet?

618
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:16,556
Speaker 1: This is also.

619
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:21,233
Speaker 1: there's a lot of elements of the planet from The one.

620
00:37:21,393 --> 00:37:23,621
Speaker 1: no the one with the thieves lock Lamora.

621
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:28,089
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah with this ancient shit lying around No one knows what the hell who's from?

622
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:39,038
Speaker 0: Yo guy, if you want to get my goat when it comes to like a book if you've got precursor technology This has more precursor shit than any Thing I've read since like star control precursor tax.

623
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:46,970
Speaker 1: I control three which is little complicated magic system star control three Which is literally about precursors and it's like you are in the precursor vessel.

624
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,338
Speaker 1: this is the Second most precursor thing.

625
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:54,006
Speaker 0: but yeah, this is the book club.

626
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:54,829
Speaker 0: We're both reading it.

627
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:56,850
Speaker 0: We'll do the show at some point in the near future.

628
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,428
Speaker 0: I feel like we're gonna blow through it.

629
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,110
Speaker 1: It won the Hugo Award two years ago and the sequel won the Hugo Award this year and the third I guess assume final.

630
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:07,001
Speaker 1: Maybe book is out now.

631
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,430
Speaker 0: the hardcover of this apparently.

632
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:18,310
Speaker 1: How could it be bad when it's that kind of is apparently hard to get because there's only one for sale on Amazon for 250 bucks meaning I got anyone that is made of electrons.

633
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:19,194
Speaker 0: I also got.

634
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:23,110
Speaker 1: that way was the cheapest version and is the most convenient regardless of its DRM.

635
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:27,070
Speaker 0: Some people have said that books two and three are good, but not as good.

636
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:34,730
Speaker 1: I've heard I heard wide variety of opinions on book two and three but so far reading book one and I'm you know.

637
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:36,435
Speaker 1: Why not read book two?

638
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:42,280
Speaker 1: if it I can go firm or deny for myself and then if book two is bad Then I can skip on three.

639
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like the Imagine.

640
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:48,390
Speaker 1: how could this thing that usually you know, we just talked about pub G, right?

641
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:56,115
Speaker 1: How can a thing when it is so acclaimed by so many it almost always turns out to be there's a reason for it Except ready player one, which is trash.

642
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:56,496
Speaker 0: Yep.

643
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:58,341
Speaker 0: I still think that was because it was.

644
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:01,650
Speaker 0: it was sent to its perfect audience.

645
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:02,657
Speaker 1: I just can't imagine.

646
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,470
Speaker 1: How could book two of this be bad?

647
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,744
Speaker 1: Anyway, you only have to read book one for the book club.

648
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:07,187
Speaker 1: So do that.

649
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:12,010
Speaker 1: Yep I have not heard anyone say anything bad about book one and I haven't read anything bad in book one.

650
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:13,188
Speaker 1: So go for it.

651
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:15,699
Speaker 0: And otherwise we were at PAX West.

652
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,763

Speaker 0: oh, yeah I did.

660
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:50,919
Speaker 1: I made a video every day at PAX cuz.

661
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:53,029
Speaker 1: someone said I couldn't do it and I did it the way.

662
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:54,669
Speaker 1: I said I would do it and it worked just fine.

663
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,788
Speaker 1: It was a pain in the ass because it'd be like what was already a pain in the ass because I had to edit video What in the morning it was?

664
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:08,610
Speaker 0: No, it was a pain in the ass for me And all I had to do was stand next to you and talk for a couple minutes before I could go to bed And even that was kind of a pain in the ass.

665
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:19,010
Speaker 1: Also, I didn't talk about it on this episode But big shake-ups are going on in the world of netrunner and I'm gonna Not talk about it on geek nights because you don't want to hear that shit.

666
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:25,789
Speaker 1: But I am gonna make netrunner with Scott one or two videos Probably just talking at the camera about what's going on.

667
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,247
Speaker 0: You could talk about it in the first half of a show because how much do I talk about overwatch?

668
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:30,890
Speaker 0: you can talk.

669
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,230
Speaker 1: No, I know there's so much talk about netrunner.

670
00:40:33,391 --> 00:40:39,410
Speaker 1: No, cuz netrunner this so much now is like more has gone down in the past two days of netrunner.

671
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:42,220
Speaker 1: It's like I could talk about it for like an hour.

672
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,449
Speaker 1: No, I'm not gonna talk about it for an hour.

673
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:48,310
Speaker 0: I don't even play netrunner and I get a lot of opinions about what's going down.

674
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:50,029
Speaker 0: That's that's the scale of what's going down.

675
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,570
Speaker 1: All I can say I'm gonna say on geek nights is that if you've thought about netrunner, right?

676
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:55,950
Speaker 1: Just wait a little bit.

677
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,435
Speaker 1: they're gonna put out this new box.

678
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:03,034
Speaker 1: just buy that one box and just play it as a two-player game with your friends and Don't buy any other stuff.

679
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:07,669
Speaker 1: and then if you decide you want to be do tournaments and shit then come back to me.

680
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:11,562
Speaker 1: Right, but the time for trying netrunner again is gonna be soon.

681
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:12,124
Speaker 1: Not right now.

682
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:17,422
Speaker 0: Yep, but soon like a couple months Maybe we probably will talk about the l5 our game at some point.

683
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,987
Speaker 1: But are you buy that shit?

684
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:19,710
Speaker 1: I'm not buying that.

685
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:22,949
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look someone else to buy it who is not you or me.

686
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:24,974
Speaker 1: Money on that.

687
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:28,265
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read the room runner or bust if netrunner dies.

688
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:29,530
Speaker 1: I'm sticking with digital games.

689
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,224
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it I got overwatch.

690
00:41:31,264 --> 00:41:31,870
Speaker 0: I'm good over.

691
00:41:32,472 --> 00:41:34,862
Speaker 1: I'll go back to regular old board games of netrunner days.

692
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:36,590
Speaker 0: overwatch is on an upswing still.

693
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:39,138
Speaker 1: So I mean I still play hearthstone every day.

694
00:41:39,158 --> 00:41:39,840
Speaker 1: I get to my quests.

695
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:44,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, I uh by skipping hearthstone I have gained the world.

696
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:49,517
Speaker 0: I can play so many other games Hearthstone Those are good games.

697
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,488
Speaker 0: So now I got to play out west of loathing and hub G.

698
00:41:52,453 --> 00:41:56,710
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play west of Lothian pub G. I'm really maybe pub G, but definitely what's the loading?

699
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,468
Speaker 0: Yeah west of loathing is it especially because at fax dev.

700
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:02,457
Speaker 0: obviously I can't talk about fax dev other than that.

701
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:03,863
Speaker 0: It was the best fax dev yet like.

702
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,425
Speaker 0: for real.

703
00:42:04,706 --> 00:42:06,938
Speaker 0: for a lot of reasons I'm very happy.

704
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:21,650
Speaker 0: I went to that fax dev but Kingdom of loathing came up like four times in independent discussions Independent of west of loathing and two of the people who brought up kingdom of loathing did not know that west of loathing came out.

705
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:22,171
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

706
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:24,037
Speaker 0: Kingdom of loathing isn't?

707
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:27,709
Speaker 0: it is more important than I had kind of expected it to be.

708
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,783
Speaker 0: and Thinking back on my experiences with that game.

709
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:31,690
Speaker 0: That game was real good.

710
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,620
Speaker 1: The only thing I remember is goofballs and the misspelled cemetery.

711
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,487
Speaker 0: Hey kid, you want some goofballs?

712
00:42:36,547 --> 00:42:41,602
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, it's funny because you tried the goofballs right.

713
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:42,125
Speaker 0: I did not.

714
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:42,507
Speaker 0: I knew better.

715
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,496
Speaker 1: you never tried good Tried him several times.

716
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:49,078
Speaker 0: I Knew better that that dude.

717
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:50,404
Speaker 0: I did not trust him for shit.

718
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:53,358
Speaker 1: I got on my balls I got off of goofballs, then I'm like, you know what?

719
00:42:53,379 --> 00:42:54,483
Speaker 1: Let's get on goofballs again.

720
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:56,600
Speaker 1: I Had nothing better to do.

721
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:59,057
Speaker 0: Let's goofball In the morning.

722
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,650
Speaker 0: ask do you have any more goofballs?

723
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:06,110
Speaker 0: The only answer to that is no one who uses goofballs has ever woken up in the morning and still had goofballs.

724
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:11,769
Speaker 0: So We played a game with Chris Anthony and Tracy at PAX.

725
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:18,832
Speaker 0: That is a good review because it was a. it's not a legacy game like write stuff on the board and then like it changes The story.

726
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:23,270
Speaker 0: no, it's a game that you can play once because you destroy it physically in the course of playing.

727
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,981
Speaker 1: Yes, it is a one-time use disposable board game.

728
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:26,543
Speaker 1: you buy it.

729
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:27,326
Speaker 1: How much does it cost?

730
00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:27,587
Speaker 1: 15 20 bucks?

731
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:28,934
Speaker 0: Yeah, not much.

732
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:35,250
Speaker 1: you open it you play it with your friends It takes about an hour and then it's done which actually you might think oh what a waste of money that is.

733
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:47,364
Speaker 1: It's like hey asshole You probably spent fifteen dollars just for one movie ticket for one person down here for about the same amount of time And this is giving you four friends or five friends or more.

734
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:48,548
Speaker 1: How many players is it?

735
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,318
Speaker 0: Uh Many yeah six.

736
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:57,648
Speaker 1: Yeah up to six people can have an hour of fun With the one but so it's only been the disposable part, right?

737
00:43:59,211 --> 00:43:59,573
Speaker 1: Right here.

738
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:03,730
Speaker 0: I have an ogre box that I have played point five times.

739
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:09,850
Speaker 1: I'll pay The amount of money it costs are one person to go to sit in one seat at one hockey game.

740
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:11,429
Speaker 1: You could buy this.

741
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:13,637
Speaker 1: How many times could you buy this game?

742
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:14,821
Speaker 0: So this game.

743
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,550
Speaker 1: so there's nothing wrong with the disposable factor of this game.

744
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:21,863
Speaker 0: Yep, I had the fun per dollar was well within reason.

745
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:38,904
Speaker 0: we played exit the game Secret lab and it's important to say the whole title because there's an entire series of exit games Including such titles as the Polar Station the Pharaoh's tomb The Forbidden Castle the Forgotten Island and the Abandoned Cave.

746
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:39,807
Speaker 1: So what the deal is?

747
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:40,830
Speaker 0: something something.

748
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:42,698
Speaker 1: So what the deal with this is?

749
00:44:42,738 --> 00:44:45,590
Speaker 1: it's basically an escape room in a box, right?

750
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,402
Speaker 1: It's made of paper and bits but it's an escape room.

751
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:51,670
Speaker 1: Yep, and it's the fact it is.

752
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:57,690
Speaker 0: I would say it is functionally indistinguishable from a real physical high money escape room.

753
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,143
Speaker 1: For every escape room that I have seen I agree.

754
00:45:01,163 --> 00:45:04,364
Speaker 0: so I don't do the full disclosure I have done because Emily's company.

755
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:09,630
Speaker 0: in the previous one We did like an outing where we all went to one of those like fancy escape rooms in Manhattan.

756
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,890
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It was real good like the production value was way higher than you would expect but not high enough for Scott.

757
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:17,897
Speaker 1: How much did it cost?

758
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:20,070
Speaker 0: I don't know nothing because I just went to it.

759
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:23,646
Speaker 1: Okay, but I bet it cost more than $15 for six people.

760
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:43,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely definitely but the only benefit the only difference between the physical big-money escape room and this is that Some of the puzzles involved crazy complicated physical shit Like there's a bust in a room and if you move it somewhere else a door opens like it's

761
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:44,770
Speaker 1: a silver monkey.

762
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:47,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but it's all triggered with like switches and stuff.

763
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:48,460
Speaker 0: It's not like.

764
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,847
Speaker 0: it's actually like built to work for real.

765
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:55,210
Speaker 0: Sure this Basically only has paper and cardboard.

766
00:45:55,504 --> 00:46:01,647
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a card mechanism where you can tell if you've solved the riddle or not and then it will take you.

767
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:04,890
Speaker 1: you open up the Next thing and now you're in the next room and you get more stuff.

768
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:10,698
Speaker 1: So you can solve more riddles to get more stuff to solve more riddles and eventually you saw the final riddle and it's like Congratulations.

769
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:11,810
Speaker 1: in it you read the end of the story.

770
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,718
Speaker 0: So this instance exit the game.

771
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,806
Speaker 0: the secret lab won the 2017.

772
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:21,655
Speaker 1: Kenner's field is yar Which is the kids field is yar which makes perfect sense because I thought Kenner Wasn't that the kinder spiel.

773
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:22,960
Speaker 0: the Kenner is like the puzzle one.

774
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:23,924
Speaker 0: I thought I don't know.

775
00:46:24,105 --> 00:46:25,190
Speaker 1: I don't figure it out.

776
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:25,852
Speaker 1: It's.

777
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:30,070
Speaker 1: it's not the regular spiel the jar, but it's still great enough to be worthy of winning an award, right?

778
00:46:30,472 --> 00:46:31,128
Speaker 1: So here's the thing.

779
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:35,010
Speaker 1: I'm really not a fan personally of escape rooms.

780
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:35,431
Speaker 1: it's just like.

781
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:36,234
Speaker 1: I don't like them.

782
00:46:37,017 --> 00:46:45,664
Speaker 1: and the number one reason I don't like them is because I Feel like yes Kenner's real is the connoisseur slash expert game.

783
00:46:45,905 --> 00:46:47,490
Speaker 1: This is not a connoisseur expert game.

784
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:49,617
Speaker 0: Well, it's niche though It is.

785
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,795
Speaker 0: this is you know You talk about gaming and how.

786
00:46:51,815 --> 00:46:55,670
Speaker 0: there's like niche market core market extent like all those different markets.

787
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:58,481
Speaker 0: This is definitely at bet.

788
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:03,810
Speaker 0: you could probably sell these extended market But this is definitely like aimed at niche slash core.

789
00:47:04,018 --> 00:47:10,910
Speaker 1: Yes But anyway, the thing I don't like about escape rooms is I think that they're basically it's a misnomer, right?

790
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,618
Speaker 1: It's like when I think of an escape room.

791
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,489
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna go to a physical place you think of saw Alright.

792
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:23,590
Speaker 1: Like if I'm gonna pay to go to escape room, I'm thinking not this kind of random puzzle numerology bullshit.

793
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:25,537
Speaker 1: It's like I want some Houdini shit, right?

794
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:27,685
Speaker 1: Time me the fuck up with chains and locks.

795
00:47:27,725 --> 00:47:30,634
Speaker 1: It's like good luck motherfucker We're closing the safe on you.

796
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:31,978
Speaker 1: Well, that's an escape.

797
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:34,165
Speaker 0: You want to like break a window and now you're in.

798
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:37,697
Speaker 0: basically American Ninja Warrior Had this idea.

799
00:47:37,758 --> 00:47:40,090
Speaker 1: It's similar to my feelings on haunted houses, right?

800
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:50,547
Speaker 1: It's like you go to a haunted house and you know that it's some guy jumping out going boo And it's like whatever you want a haunted house or a guy comes out and actually cuts you a little like hey, that would be Okay.

801
00:47:51,192 --> 00:47:53,639
Speaker 1: But what I really want is a haunted house.

802
00:47:53,679 --> 00:48:04,296
Speaker 1: you go in the haunted house and then they're like they turn on the lights on And the fire alarm goes off and they're like and the guy takes off his ghost sheet and he's like, oh, sorry guys I guess we got to evacuate.

803
00:48:04,537 --> 00:48:06,225
Speaker 0: Oh and then three years later.

804
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:07,370
Speaker 0: You're still in the game.

805
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,176
Speaker 0: You go like home with your wife.

806
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:13,710
Speaker 1: you open the emergency exit the emergency exit opens up you go out down some stairs.

807
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,381
Speaker 1: You're obviously behind the scenes, you know, you're actually.

808
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:18,123
Speaker 1: you know, you're.

809
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:21,587
Speaker 1: you feel like you're not in the haunted house anymore but you.

810
00:48:23,451 --> 00:48:25,397
Speaker 0: So it's actually scary.

811
00:48:25,417 --> 00:48:27,462
Speaker 0: did you ever see the movie the game?

812
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:29,268
Speaker 1: No, is that what that is?

813
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,130
Speaker 0: That's what that is.

814
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,317
Speaker 0: It's actually a pretty good movie.

815
00:48:31,337 --> 00:48:33,390
Speaker 1: How come I can't go to the game in real life?

816
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:38,830
Speaker 1: There are places to do that in New York actually, but I would know that is that kind of place when I'm going there.

817
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:45,010
Speaker 0: Well, that's the plot of this movie the game which I remember liking as a kid because I was in like high school.

818
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:46,690
Speaker 0: I do not know if it holds up.

819
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:51,427
Speaker 1: We have to set up what looks like a perfectly innocent haunted house at a tourist attraction.

820
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:52,330
Speaker 1: That's not.

821
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,403
Speaker 0: Well Scott, so the game was made by the same person who made seven.

822
00:48:56,644 --> 00:48:58,048
Speaker 1: so good movie.

823
00:48:58,088 --> 00:49:00,656
Speaker 1: That's it Anyway, so the point is the escape rooms.

824
00:49:00,696 --> 00:49:05,870
Speaker 1: what they really are what they should be called is solve stupid number and letter riddles.

825
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:08,178
Speaker 0: They're way more specific than that.

826
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,490
Speaker 0: escape rooms almost always follow a very specific pattern.

827
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:16,346
Speaker 0: There are a number of gates and again the gate can be.

828
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:18,493
Speaker 0: anything could be a lock It could be a pot doesn't matter.

829
00:49:18,513 --> 00:49:23,988
Speaker 0: It's a gate and the gates require between one and five alphanumeric inputs.

830
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,640
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm So you the puzzle is the puzzle.

831
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:34,542
Speaker 0: all like every puzzle all bakes down to What combination of things that I have access to.

832
00:49:34,862 --> 00:49:40,015
Speaker 0: can I convert somehow into the correct number of Inputs of the correct type.

833
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:46,650
Speaker 1: It's really like open these five combination locks, but we're not gonna just give you the numbers We're gonna give you the numbers heavily heavily obvious gate.

834
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,763
Speaker 0: So I tend to solve them by looking for all.

835
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:51,430
Speaker 0: right, we need five inputs in this puzzle.

836
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:54,059
Speaker 0: Is there five of anything anywhere?

837
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:54,400
Speaker 1: Yep.

838
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:57,350
Speaker 0: Well, there's five balls on the ground.

839
00:49:57,451 --> 00:50:00,650
Speaker 0: So, let's see if there's a way to translate balls into numbers, right?

840
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:02,950
Speaker 0: So it is but there's one other mechanic.

841
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:24,938
Speaker 0: The other thing that these all have in common is you'll have at almost every moment multiple gates Some of which can be solved with the data you already have and some of which can be solved either With the data you already have coupled with external knowledge or the data You already have coupled with data you get when you get through further lock Parallel.

842
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:25,828
Speaker 1: they don't give you.

843
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:35,570
Speaker 1: They also give you data in advance that you don't need yet because the gate is not available yet and they'll give you gates You don't have the data for yet and so on and so forth.

844
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:45,029
Speaker 1: So now you have to figure out not only how to you know Use the information to create the codes you need but also which information is relevant to which thing.

845
00:50:45,229 --> 00:50:48,680
Speaker 0: Yep So what they also do not do is they never.

846
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,389
Speaker 0: they don't have fatal consequences like well you fucked it up.

847
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:53,697
Speaker 0: They don't have just time.

848
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:55,383
Speaker 1: it's like how fast can you get out?

849
00:50:55,463 --> 00:50:56,688
Speaker 1: or do you get out in time?

850
00:50:56,748 --> 00:50:57,310
Speaker 0: Yep, that's it.

851
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:06,534
Speaker 0: They don't have triggers like oh You didn't diffuse the bomb right now the bombs gonna go off sooner or like one of your teammates is out of the game Or anything like that.

852
00:51:06,575 --> 00:51:08,404
Speaker 1: I would be better I think but no they don't.

853
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:09,650
Speaker 0: so no, that'd be awesome.

854
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,120
Speaker 0: You like open the wrong side.

855
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,268
Speaker 1: It would be better if they did that.

856
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:16,670
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it'd be better than what escape rooms are right if they had bombs that go off.

857
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:17,032
Speaker 1: It's like up.

858
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:21,130
Speaker 1: Sorry you paid for this escape room, but you didn't solve the bomb and it blew up everyone out.

859
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:24,743
Speaker 1: Basically other than done the physical don't get to see the rest of the escape room.

860
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:35,592
Speaker 0: pay and try again other than the physical Aesthetic of being in an actual physical room Exit the game is basically identical to the experience of an actual escape room Mm-hmm.

861
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:43,154
Speaker 1: So while it is fun to solve riddles, I guess if you like solving, you know cryptogram type You know things.

862
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:47,110
Speaker 1: it's fun to an extent, you know, you can get tired of it after a while, but it's okay.

863
00:51:47,914 --> 00:51:55,930
Speaker 1: It's more fun to do it with friends because they can help each other out You know, especially if no, you know, if you have a person who's smart enough They can just figure the whole thing out by themselves.

864
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:00,490
Speaker 1: But it's more fun to sort of collaborate and also because there's multiple things to work on simultaneously.

865
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:06,850
Speaker 1: You know It's like you can get through more efficiently with more people like me and Tracy were like puzzle over those flags.

866
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,096
Speaker 0: Well, you guys working on a puzzle.

867
00:52:08,136 --> 00:52:12,670
Speaker 1: I didn't even really interact with yeah, but then the stuff comes together And you put your pieces together, right?

868
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,192
Speaker 1: It's like y'all.

869
00:52:13,312 --> 00:52:20,529
Speaker 1: it's fun to solve riddles with friends and this will give you about an hour of fun riddle solving with friends Which is perfectly fine.

870
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,622
Speaker 1: But I'm still not really into escape rooms.

871
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,067
Speaker 1: It's like I wouldn't go out and like Obsessively go get the whole set of these.

872
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:32,401
Speaker 0: These are a great convention game and I like convention.

873
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:35,835
Speaker 0: if anyone brings one of these I haven't played to a convention I'm at.

874
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,129
Speaker 0: I'll probably just play it.

875
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:41,690
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing where I'd be in the mood to do it once in a while.

876
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,123
Speaker 1: Right, like I give you brought one out of these like say Scott.

877
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:45,866
Speaker 1: Let's do one now.

878
00:52:45,926 --> 00:52:51,310
Speaker 1: I'd like no If you if you even brought one on the weekend with a bunch of people I'd be like no I just did that.

879
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,909
Speaker 1: I'm not feeling that stupid thing again.

880
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:56,587
Speaker 0: But I like next year a pad wax.

881
00:52:56,607 --> 00:53:01,170
Speaker 1: next year You got another one and it like if it's the Pharaoh's tomb one, I'd probably do it.

882
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:04,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if it's what were the other lame ones, I don't the polar one.

883
00:53:04,926 --> 00:53:06,916
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd be like, yeah I don't wanna do the polar one.

884
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:07,782
Speaker 0: I don't know you're right.

885
00:53:07,802 --> 00:53:09,010
Speaker 0: Did you hear the terror, right?

886
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,410
Speaker 1: I could do some polar and I didn't read the tower, but I don't care.

887
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:14,706
Speaker 0: I mean, I might make that the next book club book even though I've read it before.

888
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:15,410
Speaker 0: cuz that's cheating.

889
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:16,496
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to do that?

890
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:17,562
Speaker 1: All right, once the future King.

891
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:17,984
Speaker 1: Here we go.

892
00:53:18,025 --> 00:53:18,407
Speaker 1: I've read it.

893
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:18,910
Speaker 0: Have you read it?

894
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll read it again.

895
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,775
Speaker 1: I love I'll have to find a book.

896
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:27,330
Speaker 0: I've read that you haven't read a careful son cuz Katamani Christo is the sword of damn.

897
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:32,630
Speaker 0: No, it's the book of Damocles hanging over you because if it fell on you would kill you just the same as a sword.

898
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,354
Speaker 1: I just wouldn't read it.

899
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:34,059
Speaker 1: what you can do about it.

900
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,809
Speaker 1: Okay, make me you can't make me.

901
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know ruin the book club the social contract.

902
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:39,084
Speaker 1: I'll get the cliff.

903
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:39,265
Speaker 1: note.

904
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:41,033
Speaker 1: what you can do bad kinda You know what?

905
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:42,342
Speaker 1: I'll watch a movie which you can do bad.

906
00:53:42,603 --> 00:53:46,063
Speaker 1: The movies are all I can fool you.

907
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:48,601
Speaker 1: The clue.

908
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:49,389
Speaker 1: I watch the anime.

909
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,974
Speaker 0: I've also watched the anime.

910
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:52,315
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

911
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:58,740
Speaker 0: I would know specifically if you only watch the anime because there are things I Forget most of the anime.

912
00:53:58,801 --> 00:53:59,690
Speaker 0: the anime is great.

913
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:12,470
Speaker 0: Actually, like I think the anime Katamani Christo is more in the spirit of the book despite taking Gratuitous liberties than any other adaptation of the Katamani Christo anyone has ever made.

914
00:54:13,374 --> 00:54:25,124
Speaker 0: But the end to the anime is Bullshit, it is a terrible ending Like it is so bad and so poorly done that it kind of ruined.

915
00:54:25,424 --> 00:54:27,530
Speaker 0: like that is an a - B plus anime.

916
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:36,230
Speaker 0: If you don't watch the last episode if you watch the last episode, it's like B. Maybe it'd be probably just a B maybe B - anyway.

917
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:44,336
Speaker 1: Exit game thingy if you got enough friends who like solving number-letter Visual kind of puzzles.

918
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:48,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the kind of friends who would be excited if you told them you had tickets to an escape room.

919
00:54:49,791 --> 00:55:00,130
Speaker 1: And if you don't mind spending 15 dollars for an hour of fun with five or six friends that you can only do one time Then buy one of these things and go for it.

920
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:04,750
Speaker 1: And maybe if your friends are the kind who are way into it, you could buy a whole set of these things and go nuts.

921
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:15,530
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you know, maybe let someone else like I did spend the money and just tag along and play for free Totally worth doing it at least one time.

922
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:23,430
Speaker 1: You know, hey, yeah, and it's you know, it's pretty it's even if you don't like doing the thing.

923
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:32,099
Speaker 1: The thing I think I enjoyed the most about it actually was not the solving of the puzzles cuz like I can get that just Like solving puzzles in a puzzle book from the drugstore.

924
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was seeing how They put this thing together like whoa.

925
00:55:37,694 --> 00:55:49,583
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The the double index look up right the double index with the cards and the paper you tear apart like how it was physically Constructed was very clever and like it's like oh the people who made this.

926
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:50,647
Speaker 1: I see what they did there.

927
00:55:50,707 --> 00:55:51,390
Speaker 1: That is cool.

928
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:52,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, how they do that.

929
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:53,819
Speaker 1: There's like a Pete.

930
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,690
Speaker 1: There's like a little clock and a compass we made and stuff.

931
00:55:56,911 --> 00:56:00,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only the only right herring we ran into was for a minute.

932
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:02,170
Speaker 0: We were all like is this star tropics?

933
00:56:02,674 --> 00:56:03,541
Speaker 0: We need to make this wet.

934
00:56:03,884 --> 00:56:11,480
Speaker 1: so he's Licked my finger and then rubbed my spit on the paper cuz we didn't have any water available and I didn't want to make the Whole paper soggy Scott.

935
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:14,194
Speaker 0: There was water 12 feet away from.

936
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:18,690
Speaker 1: I didn't want to make the I didn't want like soggy the whole paper like destroy it right.

937
00:56:19,992 --> 00:56:23,670
Speaker 1: But I thought hey, maybe if I breathe on it like ink will magic ink will appear.

938
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should have done that missed opportunity the physicality of $15.

939
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,410
Speaker 1: They should be doing that.

940
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, like we had to tear some stuff apart and we're like, oh we don't think we need to tell this.

941
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:33,057
Speaker 0: No, we needed to tear it apart.

942
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:34,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, the physicality of it was pretty good.

943
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:44,950
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm the only problem with these games is that The puzzle like the logic of the puzzle a couple of times barely made sense.

944
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:47,350
Speaker 1: Well, I mean the fiction of these things never make sense.

945
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,629
Speaker 1: It's like oh I locked you in my lab and made yourself puzzles before you Know the fiction of this way.

946
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:54,930
Speaker 1: I'm the riddler.

947
00:56:55,952 --> 00:56:59,245
Speaker 0: The fiction of this one was that we're mixing different chemicals together to make compounds.

948
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:06,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was not Nonsense, but the problem is that the logic of like, how did they expect you to solve the puzzle?

949
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,690
Speaker 0: Like what was the chain of logic that they expect you to solve it with?

950
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:20,268
Speaker 0: We solved some of them not quite that way because you don't need to have a logical chain You just need to be able to convert the right number of inputs.

951
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:23,498
Speaker 1: Yes I love basically as I was solving it.

952
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:28,452
Speaker 1: I just looked past all the fiction and only looked at the numbers and letters Colors did.

953
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:29,174
Speaker 0: did I?

954
00:57:29,214 --> 00:57:32,324
Speaker 0: did I do a transformation that made five alphanumeric characters come up?

955
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:34,070
Speaker 0: that is almost definitely the answer.

956
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:39,070
Speaker 0: Yep, and we were never wrong if we weren't able to make an output we were right.

957
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:48,978
Speaker 0: The only times we were wrong is when we made an output from scratch Just like if you're looking to be immersed in the fiction Yeah, this is not gonna help you.

958
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:52,070
Speaker 1: neither is even the most high-production quality escape room.

959
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,842
Speaker 1: You're gonna need the Scott level escape room to be immersed in the picture.

960
00:57:55,444 --> 00:57:56,750
Speaker 1: That's the only way it's gonna happen.

961
