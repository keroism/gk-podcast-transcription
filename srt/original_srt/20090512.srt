1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,626
Speaker 2: It's Tuesday, May 12th.

2
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:12,248
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:12,851
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,136
Speaker 2: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:19,525
Speaker 2: Tonight we have an amazing interview with the proprietor of the Retro Arcade Museum in Beacon?

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:23,670
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,812
Speaker 2: I really gotta get some more games to play on the train.

8
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,222
Speaker 1: What game are you gonna play on the train?

9
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:37,382
Speaker 2: Well, I was playing Civ IV for a while, but I started playing Advance Wars again.

10
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:38,746
Speaker 2: Days of Ruin.

11
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:39,589
Speaker 1: Why?

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:49,302
Speaker 2: Well, because I had two bees left, and I got rid of them, and then I got rid of almost all my A-Ranks, and then I decided I should never play Advance Wars again.

13
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:50,525
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

14
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:54,597
Speaker 1: Alright, so, here's a little story, right?

15
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:59,074
Speaker 1: We're not gonna do a news or a thing of the day today, and I will tell you why.

16
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:02,847
Speaker 1: We live in a town, or city, of Beacon, New York.

17
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,772
Speaker 1: Beacon as in a beacon of light.

18
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:10,939
Speaker 2: Yes, actually named after beacon fires that were lit during the Revolutionary War, George Washington, all this stuff.

19
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,071
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Revolutionary War shit around these parts.

20
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,223
Speaker 1: There's a George Washington head in the town.

21
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,427
Speaker 2: It's pretty big, too.

22
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:18,949
Speaker 2: It's coming.

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,873
Speaker 1: It's pretty big.

24
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:24,167
Speaker 1: And, you know, West Point is relatively close and such.

25
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:25,491
Speaker 1: There's a lot of stuff like that.

26
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:34,883
Speaker 1: Anyway, in Beacon there's this main street, and the main street is pretty long, and it's got all sorts of city kind of stuff on it.

27
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:35,285
Speaker 1: It's this

28
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:50,787
Speaker 2: weird crossbreed between one of those kind of falling apart cities along the Hudson River Valley, but at the same time it's got that almost gentrified bit where the two ends are nothing but coffee shops and art galleries, but the middle is still like the bodega and the old gas station.

29
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:51,289
Speaker 1: Yep.

30
00:01:52,292 --> 00:02:04,500
Speaker 1: So, one day, we were driving past the main street, and we see a sign on one of the, you know, a lot of the places on main street are just empty commercial space that no one can rent, and the prices are ludicrously low.

31
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:16,534
Speaker 1: And we saw a sign on a previously un-rented place, and it said, "Retro Arcade Museum," and the styling of said sign was retro indeed.

32
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:17,116
Speaker 1: It was perfect.

33
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:21,411
Speaker 1: And it had a picture of an arcade cabinet, and we were like, "What the

34
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:21,872
Speaker 1: fuck?".

35
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:22,615
Speaker 2: There's no way.

36
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,397
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

37
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,126
Speaker 2: So, you know, we're peeking in the window.

38
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,413
Speaker 2: I can't really find, like...

39
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:28,426
Speaker 1: It doesn't have a lot of windows, really.

40
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,660
Speaker 2: Well, there's like the front door with that, and I was peeking in.

41
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,249
Speaker 1: It has a little curtain, though, on the front door.

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:40,702
Speaker 2: But it wasn't even set up yet, so we just see this sign, and all I can think is, "Man, whatever that was that failed, I want to buy the

43
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:41,064
Speaker 2: sign.".

44
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:44,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, I assume that, you know, it's Beacon, right?

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,797
Speaker 1: So, this was some place that set up, didn't make enough money, and closed, right?

46
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:54,277
Speaker 1: Or maybe someone bought the sign, and they were gonna set up, and they were gonna fail.

47
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:57,250
Speaker 1: Or, you know, I just... I didn't get my hopes up.

48
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,760
Speaker 1: I was the pessimistic times of bajillion.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,680
Speaker 2: We have to drive, like, a half hour to the nearest gaming store, and it's primarily an airsoft and paintball store that happens to have, like, one set of burning wheel books.

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,075
Speaker 1: It's actually now primarily, like, a collectible card game store.

51
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,340
Speaker 2: Well, every gaming store.

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,104
Speaker 2: You can't even count that.

53
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:15,647
Speaker 2: That's just that.

54
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,612
Speaker 1: Even Millennium.

55
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,060
Speaker 1: Also some miniature action.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,104
Speaker 2: Lots of clicky things.

57
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:22,218
Speaker 2: Even Millennium is primarily Pokemon kids playing their CCGs.

58
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,752
Speaker 1: That's true, but at least they have lots of board games.

59
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:27,167
Speaker 1: This place does not have the lots of board games Millennium has.

60
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:36,784
Speaker 2: The thing is, I'm starting to realize that at Millennium, I guess that a good two-thirds, maybe three-quarters of those games have not moved since I found out about Millennium.

61
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:44,454
Speaker 2: Since I first stepped through those doors, no one has bought or will buy, like, 1942 this specific battle in Russia.

62
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:44,996
Speaker 1: That's true.

63
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,103
Speaker 1: Anyway, the retro arcade museum.

64
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:49,151
Speaker 1: So, of course, we had to investigate.

65
00:03:49,271 --> 00:04:01,571
Speaker 1: There was, you know, even if we were pessimistic, being geeks in a town that is not the kind of town that can support an arcade, investigation and supporting was very necessary.

66
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:02,916
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean, Beacon doesn't...

67
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:03,940
Speaker 1: How could we not?

68
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,390
Speaker 2: Beacon can't even support a normal arcade.

69
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,464
Speaker 2: Well, I would argue that nowhere supports normal arcades anymore.

70
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:09,946
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

71
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,939
Speaker 1: While amusement parks can't even support arcades.

72
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,579
Speaker 2: Well, we used to drive, you know, a half hour or so to play DDR because that was the nearest arcade.

73
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,302
Speaker 0: In a mall.

74
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,305
Speaker 2: Yeah, in a mall.

75
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:26,377
Speaker 2: There used to be an arcade over by IBM, and I used to go there like every day over lunch, but that shut down like five years ago.

76
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:26,839
Speaker 1: Right.

77
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,064
Speaker 1: So, we go to investigate.

78
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:30,227
Speaker 2: And there's eight people.

79
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:31,691
Speaker 1: And what do we find?

80
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:37,347
Speaker 1: but an actual arcade, but not just an actual arcade.

81
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:41,500
Speaker 1: You see, this arcade was special indeed for two reasons.

82
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:47,280
Speaker 1: Reason number one, it was actually open for business, but it was not open for business.

83
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,406
Speaker 1: Come in and pump pump your quarters.

84
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,596
Speaker 1: It's open for business parties only.

85
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:56,212
Speaker 1: So, you don't just walk right in and go, "Hey, let's play some

86
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:56,533
Speaker 1: games.".

87
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,545
Speaker 1: You got to be like, "Hey, I'm having my birthday

88
00:04:58,585 --> 00:04:58,907
Speaker 1: party.".

89
00:04:58,927 --> 00:04:59,873
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of arcades.

90
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:04,096
Speaker 1: when I was a kid, they would do the birthday party thing, but you could also walk right in.

91
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,948
Speaker 1: And when you had a birthday party, they just gave you a fistful of tokens, right?

92
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,338
Speaker 1: This place is like, what is it?

93
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:12,453
Speaker 1: I think he's charging $10 an hour per person, something like that.

94
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:14,181
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll link to all the relevant details.

95
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, the website has all the prices.

96
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:21,265
Speaker 1: And so, you have a party and you pay per person per hour and you get unlimited play.

97
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,970
Speaker 1: And it's for birthdays and shit.

98
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:30,511
Speaker 1: Secondly, barely any of the games in this arcade are video games.

99
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:38,924
Speaker 2: You see, when you think of the earliest arcade games, you probably think of things like Centipede, Pac-Man, all these kind of, you know, what you think of as retro.

100
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:39,847
Speaker 1: Space Invaders.

101
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:45,488
Speaker 2: There was an entire generation of games that were primarily mechanical in nature.

102
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:47,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, pinball, right?

103
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:53,586
Speaker 1: Pinball before, I mean, more recently, there are video pinball machines that have, you know, video screens in them and holograms and shit.

104
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:57,261
Speaker 1: But in the olden days, you know, pinball was mechanical, right?

105
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:00,555
Speaker 1: There were springs and solenoids and rails and flippers.

106
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:04,617
Speaker 2: Now, even most pinball machines that are like that now, they still have, like, the electronic scoring.

107
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,020
Speaker 2: Yeah.

108
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:09,818
Speaker 2: There are pinball machines where the scoring is just gears flipping numbers.

109
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,089
Speaker 1: You know, it's like an odometer in your car.

111
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:19,986
Speaker 1: You know, the thing, you know, spins around to keep the score and, you know, so they had mechanical pinball machines and everyone can understand a mechanical pinball machine.

112
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:20,328
Speaker 1: Right.

113
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:27,171
Speaker 1: But what some people don't remember are mechanical arcade games that are not pinball machines.

114
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:38,259
Speaker 1: You might remember, I don't know, like those shooting alleys where, like, you know, you have a gun and you shoot at these targets and, you know, but it's not using a light gun or a laser or anything like that.

115
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,781
Speaker 1: You know, it's.

116
00:06:38,962 --> 00:07:03,616
Speaker 1: it's, you know, using some mechanical method to determine, you know, if you if you hit and then when you hit it, you know, the mechanical things make like, you know, a cowboy jump out of a barrel or something like that and go, you know, and, you know, there's lots and lots of these old mechanical arcade games that are not pinball that all disappeared as soon as Pong and Space Invaders and all the video games appeared.

117
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,406
Speaker 2: I mean, just an idea of how old these games are.

118
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:10,700
Speaker 2: Sega had a game in nineteen sixty seven called Rifleman.

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,641
Speaker 1: Whoa.

120
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:15,673
Speaker 2: Nineteen one Sega to nineteen sixty seven.

121
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:22,373
Speaker 1: So Pong was in nineteen seventy two and what rifle man was in sixty seven, you said?

122
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:22,934
Speaker 1: Yeah.

123
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,158
Speaker 2: And they're there.

124
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,686
Speaker 2: These games are old and crazy.

125
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:27,568
Speaker 2: They're amazing.

126
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,657
Speaker 1: They're they're quite fantastic.

127
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:35,611
Speaker 1: The cool and to have a whole arcade full of them in the town in which we live.

128
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:41,169
Speaker 2: I mean, I remember I walked in and I see right up at the front Seawolf.

129
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:50,712
Speaker 2: And the one thing I remember about Cedar Point that I don't know if it's still there was that they had an old arcade, but it wasn't like this intentionally retro arcade.

130
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:55,874
Speaker 2: They just had all these really old arcade games and they had a lot of these, but almost all of them were broken.

131
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:56,577
Speaker 1: Yeah.

132
00:07:56,597 --> 00:08:05,939
Speaker 1: I mean, these are the kind of things because they're mechanical, because they're one of a kind, you know, no two are alike, really, unless there's someone who really knows what's going on.

133
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:11,123
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, video game machine, if it breaks right, you replace some boards, you attach the wires.

134
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:17,307
Speaker 1: It's relatively easier to maintain and fix as long as, you know, something on the board doesn't actually get fried.

135
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:19,094
Speaker 1: You know, you can you can fix it.

136
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:28,772
Speaker 1: But this mechanical game requires like an expert to maintain it and keep it going, you know, and made fixing a mechanical pinball machine is not simple.

137
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,844
Speaker 1: You know, you need skills, need knowledge, you need tools, need things.

138
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:43,244
Speaker 1: So, you know, these even if you can find these games out there, finding working ones, let alone an entire arcade full of working ones was already epically awesome.

139
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,231
Speaker 1: So we went to investigate.

140
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:49,849
Speaker 1: We found the arcade of awesome and we found the guy running the arcade of awesome.

141
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:52,639
Speaker 1: And of course, we had to interview such a man.

142
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:55,557
Speaker 2: because I think very specifically, you know, we've seen this sign.

143
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:56,704
Speaker 2: We didn't know what was going on.

144
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,997
Speaker 2: We kept thinking, you know, we got to check that out.

145
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,364
Speaker 2: We got to find out what's going on with it.

146
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,737
Speaker 2: But one day we were walking with the whole crew.

147
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,084
Speaker 2: We tried to eat at one restaurant.

148
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:04,607
Speaker 2: They were full.

149
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,316
Speaker 2: We decided to walk to the other restaurant.

150
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:11,782
Speaker 2: And as we're passing, I see the sign and I point out to the front row crew, hey, yeah, check out this sign.

151
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,479
Speaker 2: We've been waiting for this thing to open to see what the deal is here.

152
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:15,343
Speaker 2: We don't know what's going on.

153
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:18,576
Speaker 2: And then we stop and we see that now it is open.

154
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:19,299
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

155
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,567
Speaker 2: Doors unlocked and there's noise inside.

156
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:22,431
Speaker 1: Oh, shit.

157
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:25,000
Speaker 2: The crew walks in and we're just dumbfounded.

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,491
Speaker 2: And the owner is kind of standing there hanging out with his wife and kid.

159
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:31,808
Speaker 2: And 10 of us just kind of walk in awestruck.

160
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,022
Speaker 2: And this leads to about an hour of us talking to him about how amazing he is.

161
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:39,190
Speaker 1: So we went and interviewed this amazing man.

162
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,122
Speaker 1: And that's why there's no arcade.

163
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:48,486
Speaker 1: are the news and thing of the day, even though this interview was conducted a long time ago, months ago.

164
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,952
Speaker 1: Rim, rim's fault.

165
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:50,936
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were busy.

166
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:51,820
Speaker 2: Plus this was intense.

167
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,323
Speaker 1: That's all right.

168
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:53,612
Speaker 1: Because the arcade is still there.

169
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:54,941
Speaker 1: They were having a party the other night.

170
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:55,262
Speaker 1: Yep.

171
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:59,582
Speaker 2: This was intended to cover for an episode when we were out of town, but that never happened.

172
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:00,344
Speaker 1: No, it didn't happen.

173
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:09,516
Speaker 1: So listen to this, you know, amazing and epic interview with an amazing and epic person who has an amazing and epic retro arcade.

174
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:13,315
Speaker 2: And seriously, if you're in the mid Hudson Valley, you should check this place out.

175
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:14,060
Speaker 2: This is pretty hot.

176
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,500
Speaker 2: Yeah.

177
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:21,432
Speaker 1: I mean, even if you're like in New York City, if this is your, if this is your deal, right, this is the kind of thing that's not in New York City.

178
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:28,425
Speaker 1: You, you, and if you really want to see it, it might be worth your while to get your ass on the, the choo choo train and come up here.

179
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:38,589
Speaker 2: Plus, I mean, how many people take the stupid train from the city up here to beacon to go to like the DIA or the art shops or the coffee shops or all that stuff that they get people to come out of the city for.

180
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,016
Speaker 2: convey kids.

181
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,162
Speaker 2: I know a lot of you are in high school.

182
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:45,768
Speaker 2: Convince your parents to do that and that you heard beacons, a nice place and tell them you want to go to a museum.

183
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:48,485
Speaker 1: No, tell me you want your birthday party at the retro arcade museum.

184
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:52,083
Speaker 2: You know, all you have to do is tell them you want to go to a museum and bacon.

185
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,128
Speaker 1: There you go.

186
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:56,081
Speaker 1: You don't want my birthday party at the museum and beacon New York.

187
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,286
Speaker 1: So cool.

188
00:10:57,306 --> 00:10:57,727
Speaker 1: Okay.

189
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:03,573
Speaker 1: Plus, you know, your parents will love it cause this will like, you know, it will, it will nostalgia them to death.

190
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:03,895
Speaker 2: Yeah.

191
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,668
Speaker 2: Cause remember this isn't just an arcade to play these games.

192
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:11,169
Speaker 2: He's also got this display in the front of ancient, like he's got an odd, he's got a lot.

193
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:17,438
Speaker 1: You can go and see all the pictures of all the crazy shit he's got, but basically he has retro this place the fuck out.

194
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:24,186
Speaker 2: I mean in the back where he's got like the kitchen snack room, he's made a replica 1950s kitchen with all the bake light and everything.

195
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:25,009
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

196
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:30,294
Speaker 2: He's got a set of subway doors that he's like putting in so that you can open them real subway doors from New York.

197
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:30,937
Speaker 1: Yeah.

198
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:32,363
Speaker 2: He got them off an old subway.

199
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:32,926
Speaker 2: Yeah.

200
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:38,909
Speaker 1: It's a lot of stuff going on in this little retro arcade and beacon that is a worth investigating.

201
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:46,506
Speaker 2: And the only other thing I really want to say is that at some point in the future, probably after con season settles down, I mean we're going to a lot of convention in the winter.

202
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:51,327
Speaker 2: at some points we're going to run some sort of geek nights events at this place.

203
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:53,156
Speaker 1: Not too many people can fit in there.

204
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:55,526
Speaker 2: This will be some very exclusive event.

205
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:59,000
Speaker 2: It'll have to be either invite only or maybe we'll do a charity auction.

206
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,342
Speaker 2: I don't know.

207
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:00,468
Speaker 2: We'll figure something out.

208
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:02,298
Speaker 1: Charity thing might be really good.

209
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:03,683
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a good idea.

210
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,638
Speaker 0: My name is Fred Barbara and this is the retro arcade museum.

211
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,910
Speaker 0: It's what I like to think of as a living museum.

212
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:24,149
Speaker 0: Not only can you see these beautiful works of art that were made by master craftsmen and real artists back when things were hand built, but you can experience them.

213
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,435
Speaker 0: So it's a, it's a, it's a visceral museum.

214
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,163
Speaker 1: So what started all of this?

215
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:36,925
Speaker 0: When I was a boy growing up in the sixties, my dad took me to an arcade in flushing Queens.

216
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:40,120
Speaker 0: My, my grandparents lived in flushing and there was an arcade there.

217
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,608
Speaker 0: It's it's a, it was a wonderful place.

218
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,308
Speaker 0: And that was back in the days when there was actually an airport in flushing, the flushing airport.

219
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:56,979
Speaker 0: and right across the road, across the parking lot from the flushing airport was the adventurers in, and it was an amusement park.

220
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,243
Speaker 0: It was an arcade.

221
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,286
Speaker 0: It was everything.

222
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:03,722
Speaker 0: And it was probably there from like, I'm guessing the 1950s through the eighties.

223
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:12,151
Speaker 0: And I was probably there during the hay day because that was the crossover from when there were no video games.

224
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:17,126
Speaker 0: It was really the video games had just come out and say mid to early seventies.

225
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:21,741
Speaker 0: So primarily I had the leftover electromechanicals to play with.

226
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:26,455
Speaker 0: And those are some of my fondest childhood memories was going with my dad.

227
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:31,740
Speaker 0: And when I got into my forties I don't know if you want to call it a midlife crisis or whatever it is.

228
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,128
Speaker 0: I wasn't ready to buy a vet.

229
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:41,050
Speaker 0: So I decided I I'll just buy one of the games that I remember playing when I was a boy with my dad.

230
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,900
Speaker 0: And that first game was a, it was a sea devil.

231
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,246
Speaker 0: And that was it.

232
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,415
Speaker 0: Once I got the first game, I got it delivered.

233
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:49,279
Speaker 0: I started playing it.

234
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:51,847
Speaker 0: It was, it, it's an obsession.

235
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:56,060
Speaker 0: It really turned into something beyond anything I imagined.

236
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,740
Speaker 0: And it's another one of those stories where life leads you places you never think it will.

237
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,020
Speaker 0: So this is about my fourth career and this is you know, just another, another stage.

238
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,752
Speaker 1: So the machines in this arcade, are these all the ones you have?

239
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:12,435
Speaker 0: No.

240
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,844
Speaker 0: In fact, there are about 40 machines here.

241
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:22,989
Speaker 0: This is, I haven't counted recently, but this is probably a third to a quarter of the total machines.

242
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,662
Speaker 0: The rest of the machines are in a warehouse about 10 minutes from here.

243
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:34,448
Speaker 0: And I'm going to try and rotate machines in and out on an as needed basis if I get tired of something.

244
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:40,517
Speaker 0: Or if I see that people are not playing a particular game, I'm going to want to share, you know, a new game with them.

245
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,524
Speaker 0: Or if something comes in that I'm really excited about.

246
00:14:42,884 --> 00:15:03,007
Speaker 0: There are some games that are, that are just so collectible that they'll probably never make it to the game room because they're, they're so rare and they're so valuable that if a private collector would want to see them, they can make an appointment to come to the warehouse.

247
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:08,031
Speaker 0: And I'll be glad to show it to them, but it's not something I would put on public display.

248
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,288
Speaker 0: Although, you know, there are some things that I may, you know, loosen up on.

249
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,675
Speaker 0: There, there are certain machines here that I swore that I'd never put out and then I ended up putting them out.

250
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:17,519
Speaker 0: So, you know.

251
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:20,420
Speaker 2: So what are some of these rare games that you're not going to put out?

252
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,225
Speaker 0: Some of the super rare games that I'm concerned about putting out on the floor are something called the Casco Star Five.

253
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:29,111
Speaker 0: It's a sit down game.

254
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:36,115
Speaker 0: It's about seven feet long and you sit in the cockpit of a spaceship and you have your control in front of you.

255
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:39,028
Speaker 0: And it's sort of like the old Star Wars games.

256
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,117
Speaker 0: The difference is it was all electromechanical.

257
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,674
Speaker 0: So there's this planet inside that you have to shoot these targets on.

258
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:50,233
Speaker 0: Well, it's sort of like a basketball that moves on this gimbal in all different directions.

259
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:54,067
Speaker 0: And it's just one of the coolest effects ever.

260
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,357
Speaker 0: I mean, that's, you know, that's one of those things.

261
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,216
Speaker 0: I have some games that are like still in the box, new old stock games, they call them.

262
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:08,015
Speaker 0: So from like 1967 or 1970, I have an Allied Leisure WhatsApp.

263
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,282
Speaker 0: It's literally still in the original box.

264
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:12,048
Speaker 0: It came in a cardboard box.

265
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,096
Speaker 0: The thing probably weighs 300 pounds.

266
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:17,808
Speaker 0: Most of these games weigh between 250 and 400 pounds.

267
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,146
Speaker 0: And this particular game, you know, it's literally still in the box that it came in.

268
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:26,261
Speaker 0: And, you know, I take it out, you know, to look at it.

269
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:28,270
Speaker 0: All the machines have counters on them.

270
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,420
Speaker 0: That's a whole interesting aspect of this.

271
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:35,060
Speaker 0: So every time somebody plays the game, you can tell that, you know, a play took place.

272
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,576
Speaker 0: And on some of the original games, they'll have three on the counter.

273
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:45,673
Speaker 0: On some of my, you know, games that I play here, I have 90,000 plays.

274
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:49,508
Speaker 0: I mean, that's a testament to how well they were built and all that sort of thing.

275
00:16:49,528 --> 00:17:01,360
Speaker 0: If you can only imagine that somebody cycled through these things 90,000 times and they're still reparable, they're still, you know, they function almost like they did when they were new or as maybe better in some cases.

276
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,239
Speaker 1: So what makes these arcade games different from the ones that we're used to?

277
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,289
Speaker 0: I say there are two categories of arcade games.

278
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:12,164
Speaker 0: There's video arcade games and there's non-video arcade games.

279
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:14,798
Speaker 0: And like if you go to eBay, that's how you find these games.

280
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,044
Speaker 0: You put in non-video games.

281
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:19,280
Speaker 0: Then there are all these other subcategories, these little subclasses.

282
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:26,223
Speaker 0: There are games called trade stimulators, which aren't games per se, but they get you to do things.

283
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,990
Speaker 0: So you get interested in it.

284
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:35,802
Speaker 0: So that would be like a Mutascope viewer where you're actually looking at, you know, like images that go by like cards that create an animation.

285
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:47,380
Speaker 0: or an example of a trade stimulator would be some of my card machines from the thirties through the sixties that dispense postcards and people would collect these postcards.

286
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:51,054
Speaker 0: That's a whole separate like sub hobby of these hobbies.

287
00:17:51,115 --> 00:18:00,404
Speaker 0: But I think the biggest difference is in video games, starting in say 1976, that was really the cutoff when they stopped making electromechanical games.

288
00:18:01,026 --> 00:18:05,942
Speaker 0: The real difference is that the electromechanicals had no video screens.

289
00:18:06,383 --> 00:18:09,033
Speaker 0: At the very end, they started using microprocessors.

290
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:14,852
Speaker 0: So occasionally, in some of the allied leisure games, you will find chips.

291
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:15,976
Speaker 0: You'll find like 7400 series chips.

292
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,789
Speaker 0: They're really super pre-8888 chips.

293
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:20,934
Speaker 0: These weren't computer chips.

294
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:22,761
Speaker 0: They were TTL logic chips.

295
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,432
Speaker 0: So they were the really earliest.

296
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:34,563
Speaker 0: And they still didn't perform all the functions because there's still bicycle chains and relays and gears and wipers and motors and all kinds of things inside.

297
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:56,706
Speaker 0: But what really differentiates today's machines is that today's machines are almost purely electronic driven and even the input devices, like the steering wheels and all that, they're digital in nature so that they cause a digital signal to take place within the electronic circuits.

298
00:18:57,288 --> 00:19:02,228
Speaker 0: But these are, I go in and I have to grease these things up like it was a mechanic's garage.

299
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:08,055
Speaker 0: I'll walk out of here and my hands will be covered with motor oil or grease or whatever when we're working on these things.

300
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:09,882
Speaker 0: So that's probably the biggest difference.

301
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:19,188
Speaker 0: And the other difference is that these are all wood, handmade, and they were literally hand-wired.

302
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,839
Speaker 0: And I was in the music business for a long time.

303
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,550
Speaker 0: My background is in music and television production.

304
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,778
Speaker 0: I went to film school back in the early 80s.

305
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,795
Speaker 0: And back then, again, it was a more visceral kind of thing.

306
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:36,402
Speaker 0: When we made film, you would touch the film.

307
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:38,769
Speaker 0: You'd work on an editing console.

308
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,577
Speaker 0: You'd work on a Steenbeck or on a Provost.

309
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:46,493
Speaker 0: And, you know, you'd have your bins and everything would be hanging up.

310
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:50,849
Speaker 0: Everything today is an analogy to what it was in the past.

311
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,768
Speaker 0: So they still use the word bin for your story clips on a non-linear edit system.

312
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,163
Speaker 0: But they got the word bin because we used to carry these bins around.

313
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:03,602
Speaker 0: We used to wheel these things around that actually were giant laundry bins, basically.

314
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:07,596
Speaker 0: And the analogy is sort of there with the games.

315
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:14,964
Speaker 0: There are a lot of similarities with the games, except what they did back then was they recreated the effects that you create today inside of a computer.

316
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:46,205
Speaker 0: And the comparison to the audio and the music is that what I would consider state of the art, which was the golden days of music when they were recording Beatles and Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin albums back in Abbey Road Studios and they were recording on Neve consoles, they were called discrete consoles because of the circuitry that was used in them and because they were hand wired and they didn't use integrated circuits.

317
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:54,793
Speaker 0: They used transistors and they used capacitors and they used devices to amplify and to make the sounds have that warmth.

318
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:58,167
Speaker 0: And there was a reason why things looked and sounded and felt that way.

319
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,522
Speaker 0: And that's the experience that you get with these machines.

320
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,974
Speaker 0: They were literally hand wired by an individual.

321
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:22,125
Speaker 0: Not to say that they don't do that now, but every element of these things was hand built from cutting the glass to the wiring to assembling and testing it and stapling in, you know, the instructions and, you know, just a whole different feel.

322
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,585
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some of the more clever tricks that the designers of these games used?

323
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:32,727
Speaker 0: Some of the really interesting stuff was back in the early 70s, the earliest of holograms.

324
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,342
Speaker 0: You know, for a while holograms were like the hot new technology.

325
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:39,069
Speaker 0: Now it's on everybody's credit card.

326
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:51,114
Speaker 0: But when holograms were used to do actual 3D depth and depth perception, an example of a game that used a hologram would be a Casco Bank Robbers, which I don't have on the floor.

327
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:52,641
Speaker 0: That's one that I keep off the floor.

328
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:54,308
Speaker 0: But that used holograms.

329
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:57,361
Speaker 0: I'm trying to acquire another holographic game right now.

330
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,920
Speaker 0: And so it really gave you that sense of depth and it gave you the 3D perspective.

331
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:10,361
Speaker 0: On almost all of these games, they used a lot of tricks, using half mirrors, half coated mirrors.

332
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:16,940
Speaker 0: And what the mirrors did and what they do was to create this illusion of depth.

333
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,677
Speaker 0: You'll notice that the machines are fairly shallow, but they're very tall.

334
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:32,447
Speaker 0: And the reason for that is because all of the backgrounds are vertical and the mirrors that are facing towards you are horizontal.

335
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:42,885
Speaker 0: And it creates this depth of illusion because you're looking at a three and a half, four foot play field on the mirrors, but it's only about two feet in front of your face.

336
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:48,149
Speaker 0: So they don't have to make the machines five or six feet long in order to get that feeling, to get that effect.

337
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:51,443
Speaker 0: So, you know, they use the word smoke and mirrors.

338
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:55,503
Speaker 0: It was really done with mirrors and, you know, some of the most unique things were done with mirrors.

339
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,182
Speaker 0: And then combining things like, for instance, the Roadrunner game.

340
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,330
Speaker 0: It's a very desirable auto racing game.

341
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:12,163
Speaker 0: And they use the combination of the mirrors, this kind of holographic trick where the car is projected onto another background, onto another mirror.

342
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,231
Speaker 0: So you're seeing a projection of the car in a mirror.

343
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:23,402
Speaker 0: So when the car gets into an accident, when you hit another car, another car hits you, the car is on a separate motor.

344
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:29,646
Speaker 0: So it flips around in 3D space and it's physically flipping in 3D space, but you don't know that to you.

345
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:33,725
Speaker 0: It just looks like there's this car, you know, on the track that just did a rollover.

346
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:35,731
Speaker 0: And it's pretty amazing.

347
00:23:36,614 --> 00:23:40,145
Speaker 0: The creativity that these engineers used is unbelievable.

348
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:45,680
Speaker 0: The other side of it is the artisans that created the back glasses.

349
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:51,400
Speaker 0: In many cases, the back glasses are as valuable or more valuable than the machines themselves.

350
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,611
Speaker 0: Because you can buy parts for the machines.

351
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:55,655
Speaker 0: You can buy relays.

352
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:56,720
Speaker 0: You can buy the switches.

353
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,507
Speaker 0: You can buy all of these parts.

354
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:03,286
Speaker 0: And if you can't find something specific, you can almost always fabricate it or find something.

355
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:07,299
Speaker 0: But the artwork is just incredible.

356
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:18,411
Speaker 0: They used a very complicated process of lithography, mirror backings, to create that illusion of transparency or opaqueness in certain parts of the glass.

357
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:21,161
Speaker 0: And the other side of that is just.

358
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:23,690
Speaker 0: the artists were just phenomenally talented.

359
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,517
Speaker 0: It was just beautifully done.

360
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:39,973
Speaker 0: You know, I've had people come in that came from, for instance, they came from an exhibit at the Dia Beacon, and they look at this artwork and said, you know, that this is as fine an artwork as you would see in what you would consider legitimate art.

361
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:41,822
Speaker 0: You know, it's just done for a different reason.

362
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:48,511
Speaker 0: And you can also tell the difference in the cultural differences, the generational differences from the '60s to the '70s to the '80s.

363
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:52,231
Speaker 0: The art had a different feel and had a different look to it.

364
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:56,000
Speaker 2: So what was your first machine?

365
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:06,485
Speaker 0: The very first machine that I acquired, and I think I found it on eBay, was a Midway Sea Devil, a 1969 Sea Devil.

366
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:12,180
Speaker 0: And it's a submarine shooting game, and it has that 3D depth illusion.

367
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,846
Speaker 0: The reason why I liked it when I was a kid and the reason why I like it now is because it's got a periscope on it.

368
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:26,435
Speaker 0: And the fun part about these games is that they've got real steering wheels from real cars or what feels like a real periscope.

369
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:33,925
Speaker 0: It's not just that you're simulating this 3D experience, but you're also touching these three-dimensional objects that feel so real.

370
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:37,577
Speaker 0: So I collect a lot of submarine games.

371
00:25:37,617 --> 00:25:41,514
Speaker 0: That's like a big hobby just on the side of collecting these submarine games.

372
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:47,156
Speaker 0: But that specifically was the one that when I was a kid I had these really strong memories of.

373
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:54,581
Speaker 0: Here in the place I have several games that I remember so vividly from when I was eight years old or nine years old.

374
00:25:55,383 --> 00:26:01,380
Speaker 0: And for instance, Allied Leisure Super Shifter or the Mutascope Drive Mobile Trainer.

375
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:16,045
Speaker 0: And while these games aren't necessarily the most collectible or anything like that, those are the ones that I remember playing because to me, to an eight-year-old, what could be more exciting than driving a car?

376
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:26,461
Speaker 0: And even today, I'll put an experienced driver behind the wheel of one of these things, and their jaw drops, and there's this rush of panic in their face.

377
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:27,464
Speaker 0: What do I do?

378
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,173
Speaker 0: Well, it's just like driving a real car.

379
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:33,880
Speaker 0: It's a clutch-shift-guess.

380
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,166
Speaker 0: Clutch-shift-guess.

381
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:35,890
Speaker 0: Clutch-shift-guess.

382
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,264
Speaker 0: And you go over this with them, and it's like, "I can't do

383
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:38,324
Speaker 0: it.".

384
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:40,417
Speaker 0: They get very nervous, and they'll move on to another game.

385
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,248
Speaker 0: I'll try and coax them back.

386
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:44,219
Speaker 0: I don't want them to give up.

387
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:49,960
Speaker 2: When you finally got a hold of these games again, older and wiser, were they as good as you remembered?

388
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:51,724
Speaker 0: They were better, yes.

389
00:26:52,005 --> 00:27:12,463
Speaker 0: When I acquired these games as an adult, they say that love is sweeter the second time around, and these games are sweeter the second time around because not only do I get to enjoy them, and I do enjoy them so much, but it brings back that rush of memories.

390
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:14,149
Speaker 0: It's the sense memory.

391
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,581
Speaker 0: These games have, I mean, literally, they have a feel.

392
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,126
Speaker 0: They even have a smell.

393
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,389
Speaker 0: You can smell the wood.

394
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,994
Speaker 0: You can smell the electronics.

395
00:27:23,298 --> 00:27:35,018
Speaker 0: It's the whole experience of everything, so I enjoy every bit of it as much, maybe more now.

396
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:54,139
Speaker 0: I think now, I think what I get out of it now is when people sit down in these who've never experienced them before, I get a huge rush out of that because exposing someone to something that may disappear in the next 10 years, that's a great feeling, and being able to rescue that feeling.

397
00:27:55,481 --> 00:28:20,400
Speaker 0: The other thing is people that do remember them who are in my age or maybe a little bit older, I've seen people almost in tears when they walk over to a game and they remember it, and their memories just come flooding out in such minutia, in such detail that I feel like I'm experiencing something with them, so that's a really nice feeling.

398
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,639
Speaker 2: How did the actual museum itself come to be?

399
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,442
Speaker 0: Originally, I had a handful of machines in my home, and then I started getting more and more machines.

400
00:28:29,482 --> 00:28:38,752
Speaker 0: I started acquiring more machines as time went on, and so I started renting storage space from indoor mini storage and that sort of thing.

401
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:43,107
Speaker 0: I started with one locker and two lockers and three.

402
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:50,534
Speaker 0: Eventually, I had eight lockers, like almost a couple thousand square feet, and I couldn't get to any of the games.

403
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:51,919
Speaker 0: I couldn't play anything.

404
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,312
Speaker 0: Even though I had electricity there, it was such a hassle.

405
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,720
Speaker 0: I couldn't show anybody anything.

406
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:03,753
Speaker 0: It's not very interesting to bring someone to a storage facility and just show them games, and for the most part, they were still wrapped or boxed or whatnot.

407
00:29:03,793 --> 00:29:12,179
Speaker 0: I hadn't had a chance to work on them, except for the very few that I had in my home, so I decided that I needed to get them out.

408
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:15,313
Speaker 0: I started looking around for commercial real estate space.

409
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:20,294
Speaker 0: Originally, I was looking for a big warehouse, and then I would have people come into the warehouse and play them.

410
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:23,022
Speaker 0: Somehow, this came along.

411
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:31,243
Speaker 0: I had been to Beacon several times with my wife and my family, and I really loved the town.

412
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:40,208
Speaker 0: I like the fact that it feels like the cross between an artist community and a little bit of Soho.

413
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:45,644
Speaker 0: I lived in Soho for a while, so it's got a little bit of everything, and that great diner.

414
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:54,769
Speaker 0: It brings back so many nice memories, and I just decided that this place just happened to come along at the right time.

415
00:29:55,451 --> 00:30:05,161
Speaker 0: It cost me about as much to store as to have a storefront, although there are a lot of other expenses, but this is a dream come true.

416
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:14,507
Speaker 0: For anybody who's a gaming enthusiast to have their own arcade, a real arcade, it's a dream come true.

417
00:30:14,527 --> 00:30:16,700
Speaker 0: I can't compare it to anything else.

418
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:29,440
Speaker 0: I guess it's like a musician having their own recording studio, or if you're an athlete, if you have a real regulation basketball court or a tennis court, I get to experience this.

419
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:39,436
Speaker 0: Hopefully when my daughter is old enough to really appreciate it, and she's six, seven years old, she'll really start getting those feelings that I had for the machines and the games.

420
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:42,740
Speaker 2: We have to ask, what was your first computer?

421
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,564
Speaker 0: Wow, my first computer.

422
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:49,393
Speaker 0: Boy, oh boy, you really did.

423
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,195
Speaker 0: I think it was a VIC.

424
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:54,890
Speaker 0: I think my first computer was a Commodore 64 or a VIC.

425
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,416
Speaker 0: They came out about the same time.

426
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:58,743
Speaker 0: I had a Commodore 64, I had a VIC.

427
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:06,002
Speaker 0: I took computers in high school, and we had a Wang Olivetti, and we had a PET.

428
00:31:06,604 --> 00:31:07,567
Speaker 0: I remember that.

429
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,495
Speaker 0: I was terrible in computers.

430
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:19,620
Speaker 0: The irony is I ended up spending a good portion of my life developing and designing software and applications, but I nearly failed at computers in high school.

431
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:25,695
Speaker 0: The extent of my computer experience in college was shoeboxes full of punch cards.

432
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:29,083
Speaker 0: That was not for me.

433
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:32,912
Speaker 0: I had to wait until things got a little more advanced.

434
00:31:32,973 --> 00:31:36,504
Speaker 0: I always wondered how things worked.

435
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:38,835
Speaker 0: From the time I was a little boy, I would take things apart.

436
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:44,904
Speaker 0: I didn't necessarily know how to put them back together, but I would always manage to get them apart and get all the pieces separated.

437
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:47,331
Speaker 0: Now I take a Polaroid before I take it apart.

438
00:31:47,672 --> 00:32:02,340
Speaker 0: It's funny because I have always tried to be on the forefront, and now that I'm in this whole retro world, it's almost like being on the forefront of the retro world.

439
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:10,854
Speaker 0: The really exciting part is the expression that I use is that when I get something that's 40 or 50 years old, they say, "Oh, you got another old

440
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:11,155
Speaker 0: game?".

441
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:14,309
Speaker 0: I said, "Well, it's new to me," and I get to learn about it.

442
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,674
Speaker 0: I get to read the schematics.

443
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:17,542
Speaker 0: I get to figure out how it worked.

444
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:27,072
Speaker 0: I take it apart, and I'll sit there with a light and stare at it for like a half an hour or 45 minutes or an hour before I even touch it so I can try and figure out, "Okay, what's going

445
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:27,276
Speaker 0: on?".

446
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:34,253
Speaker 0: Eventually, you become more adept at these things, and you know how to hunt things down and how things work, but there's always some new twists.

447
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:54,857
Speaker 0: There's always something that you can't figure out, but being on the forefront of technology makes me appreciate this stuff even more because I don't know if people today are creative enough to have built something like this because this doesn't involve just sitting down and writing code.

448
00:32:55,178 --> 00:32:57,329
Speaker 0: This involves something physical.

449
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:59,200
Speaker 0: This involves something tactile.

450
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:04,837
Speaker 0: Now the big thing is creating haptic feedback and haptic controllers.

451
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:09,415
Speaker 0: For instance, when I was working at the medical school, we were doing virtual surgery.

452
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:39,340
Speaker 0: In other words, we would set up a computer and a haptic controller like it could be anything from a scalpel to a forcep or any type of minimally invasive operating device, and that would be connected to a computer, and then via the internet, we'd run fiber through AT&T or whomever was the provider to Europe.

453
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:42,666
Speaker 0: This is true.

454
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:49,331
Speaker 0: This is happening right now that you could actually operate on a patient, and you could force feedback what it feels like.

455
00:33:49,933 --> 00:34:01,419
Speaker 0: Now, I'm not a physician, so I never actually cut flesh, but I know what the physician needed to feel in order to be able to do that, so these are the types of things that we tried to simulate for them.

456
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,656
Speaker 0: The drawback to an experience like that is that it wasn't immediate.

457
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:09,906
Speaker 0: The force feedback didn't happen right away.

458
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:13,061
Speaker 0: There was always a millisecond or two or three millisecond delay.

459
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:35,279
Speaker 0: Well, that may not seem like a lot, a thousandth of a second, but if somebody's artery starts bleeding, you may only have a second or two to clamp it and move on to the next thing, so there really was this kind of crossover, this melding of the computers and these physical devices.

460
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,108
Speaker 0: I like to say that we're all analog.

461
00:34:38,992 --> 00:35:05,036
Speaker 0: As we sit here and as we breathe, as we look at each other, no matter how many times our brains are firing, no matter how many times our neurons are firing, you wouldn't see me if there wasn't light reflecting into our eyes and we didn't have a lens in front of our eyes, and that's analog, so no matter how much people talk about digital, digital, digital, that we live in a digital world, we really physically live in an analog world and we just like to store things digitally or we like to manipulate things digitally.

462
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,804
Speaker 0: These machines are pure analog.

463
00:35:07,824 --> 00:35:08,726
Speaker 0: They rub against one another.

464
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:25,520
Speaker 0: There are parts that move and they rub and they count and they're very simple, but then they show you that part of the brain before there was integrated circuits to do the calculating for you.

465
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,533
Speaker 0: It's almost like if you go back to Roman culture.

466
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:39,635
Speaker 0: when they created these pedometers, they were able to actually count the kilometers when they built this incredible road system.

467
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:54,799
Speaker 0: Even today, people have a hard time figuring out how these devices worked, and that's amazing to me, so just having an appreciation of those kinds of things, that's a whole other world that we get to explore in these games.

468
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,733
Speaker 2: Could you tell us a little bit about yourself?

469
00:35:57,794 --> 00:35:58,620
Speaker 2: What came before?

470
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:06,423
Speaker 0: I've always worked from the time I was 13 years old, and I started out working, doing retail.

471
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:07,487
Speaker 0: I worked in Sam Goody.

472
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:15,556
Speaker 0: It always had something to do with something creative back when Sam Goody was still around, but I worked for a wedding photographer.

473
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:22,337
Speaker 0: Back in the days before there was videotape, and what we did was we shot on film.

474
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:23,761
Speaker 0: There wasn't even Super 8 film.

475
00:36:23,801 --> 00:36:31,739
Speaker 0: We shot on 16, and then we sliced the film in half to make 8-millimeter film, and then people would take those 8-millimeter films.

476
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:38,635
Speaker 0: That was my start, and that inspired me to go to film school.

477
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:45,982
Speaker 0: Originally, I started out going to the film school at Brooklyn College, which at that time was a very prestigious film school.

478
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:51,040
Speaker 0: We had George Roy Hill and Paul Newman and all these wonderful guest visitors.

479
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:56,296
Speaker 0: The best part about Brooklyn College film school was the equipment room.

480
00:36:56,617 --> 00:37:01,234
Speaker 0: We had all the gear we could ever want and take it out anytime we wanted.

481
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:02,760
Speaker 0: I remember the guy's names.

482
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,271
Speaker 0: It was Lenny and Steve, these two guys in there.

483
00:37:07,154 --> 00:37:09,342
Speaker 0: Here I was, and I was very young when I went to school.

484
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:12,111
Speaker 0: I was 16 when I started college.

485
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:14,339
Speaker 0: Here I am, a 16-year-old kid.

486
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,143
Speaker 0: I wanted to make a movie.

487
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:19,543
Speaker 0: I'd go in and say, "Yeah, I'd like an Arri CP-16 and give me a set of three Schneider

488
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:19,925
Speaker 0: Primes.".

489
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,400
Speaker 0: I'd walk out, and I'd be so ... I mean, I couldn't believe it.

490
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,626
Speaker 0: They'd give me light kits.

491
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:25,449
Speaker 0: They'd give me everything.

492
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:32,520
Speaker 0: I really got the feel of being in school, when I was in school, of being in the film industry.

493
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,255
Speaker 0: Something happened where I wasn't able to continue in film school.

494
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:43,915
Speaker 0: I actually developed a problem with my eyes, and I had corneal transplants back in 1981 and '84.

495
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:52,810
Speaker 0: Fortunately, I got my vision back, but it took years for me to get my vision back, so I figured if I can't use my eyes, I'll use my ears.

496
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,522
Speaker 0: I'd always been a musician, so I went into the music business.

497
00:37:57,126 --> 00:38:00,094
Speaker 0: I was in bands all through high school and everything else.

498
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:04,088
Speaker 0: One of my bands got signed to an indie label.

499
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,660
Speaker 0: The next thing I know, we were renting a house in Woodstock.

500
00:38:07,222 --> 00:38:09,089
Speaker 0: I built a recording studio in the house.

501
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:16,330
Speaker 0: Back then, it was a big deal to have a 16-track recording studio, and I spent about a year just recording music.

502
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:26,980
Speaker 0: The band took a turn from what we originally signed for, so I came back to New York as a recording engineer.

503
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,574
Speaker 0: That kicked off about a 15-year career in the music industry.

504
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:37,028
Speaker 0: I worked for all the majors at the time, when there were a lot of labels.

505
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:42,746
Speaker 0: I worked for MCA and EMI and Sony and Columbia and just down the list.

506
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:46,699
Speaker 0: If I mention the artists, most people look at me, stare blankly.

507
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,254
Speaker 0: Some of the names will ring familiar, like almost as old as these acts.

508
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:57,810
Speaker 0: I worked with Biz Markie and Brenda K. Starr.

509
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:02,283
Speaker 0: I worked on movies like the Lombato movies and all sorts of things like that.

510
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:07,938
Speaker 0: It's all very quaint now, but it was a really fun, exciting career.

511
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,744
Speaker 0: I got to meet my heroes.

512
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:11,210
Speaker 0: I got to work with my heroes.

513
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,545
Speaker 0: I spent two years working with a man named Amir Diodato.

514
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:20,958
Speaker 0: Diodato was the arranger for Roberta Flack for Killing Me Softly.

515
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,915
Speaker 0: He did all of the Cool and the Gang albums, like Ladies Night and Too Hot.

516
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:26,643
Speaker 0: He wrote and recorded all those records.

517
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:29,655
Speaker 0: I got to meet all these incredible people.

518
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:32,826
Speaker 0: I got to meet all these producers who I had admired.

519
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:35,415
Speaker 0: I have a lot of autographed CDs.

520
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:39,231
Speaker 0: Ironically, it's not the artists, but it's the producers who autographed it for me.

521
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:53,360
Speaker 0: I got to be in all these wonderful sessions and meet from the hard rock guys and hanging out with Aerosmith and being backstage to the coolest jazz guys like Peter Erskine and recording them and doing sessions with them.

522
00:39:53,821 --> 00:39:55,204
Speaker 0: It was just so exciting.

523
00:39:57,087 --> 00:40:10,820
Speaker 0: Then, I guess, I was probably in my mid-30s, and I decided that there was a point where I actually saw my ... There's that expression, "Jumping the

524
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,221
Speaker 0: shark.".

525
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:14,451
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of my heroes jump the shark.

526
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:17,701
Speaker 0: You're familiar with that expression, right?

527
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:20,768
Speaker 0: Okay.

528
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:25,519
Speaker 0: Unfortunately, these guys, when they get to a certain age, there's an expression.

529
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,947
Speaker 0: It's like every other business.

530
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:37,665
Speaker 0: I don't care whether you're a coder, a computer coder, or you're as good as your last game, or you're as good as your last record, or you're as good as your last movie.

531
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:42,144
Speaker 0: If you have two flops in a row, good luck getting hired for the next one.

532
00:40:42,184 --> 00:40:44,050
Speaker 0: The music business is changing dramatically.

533
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:49,268
Speaker 0: One of the main reasons that I got ... I got a foothold in.

534
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:54,687
Speaker 0: why I was successful in the music industry is because I was one of the very first people in computer music.

535
00:40:56,011 --> 00:41:02,835
Speaker 0: Before there were computers in computer music, there were sequencers that you had to take patch cords and plug things in.

536
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:04,200
Speaker 0: We used those sequencers.

537
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,533
Speaker 0: I was one of the geeks who knew how to do all that stuff.

538
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:09,862
Speaker 0: Plus, I was like a hard rock guy.

539
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:15,215
Speaker 0: Back then, when I had hair, more of it, I had hair down to my waist.

540
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:19,952
Speaker 0: I was in a heavy metal band, but I knew how to do all the MIDI stuff.

541
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:23,123
Speaker 0: Even before MIDI was a standard, I knew how to do all that.

542
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:26,291
Speaker 0: I was able to get a foothold.

543
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:31,445
Speaker 0: That launched me into the music business in a big way.

544
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:35,615
Speaker 0: I went from doing my hard rock band to doing this MIDI thing.

545
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:42,913
Speaker 0: Then I wanted something a little more serious in my life.

546
00:41:42,973 --> 00:41:49,072
Speaker 0: I decided that I would do a complete change and I would go more into a corporate thing.

547
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,244
Speaker 0: I had been running a major recording studio at the time.

548
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:58,767
Speaker 0: I was, at that time, more in the business end of the music business and not doing as much creative stuff.

549
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:06,889
Speaker 0: An opportunity came along for me to be a multimedia producer at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

550
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,774
Speaker 0: That was in about '95 or '96.

551
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:12,906
Speaker 0: I said, "Well, it's steady work.

552
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:14,130
Speaker 0: It's a full-time job.

553
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:15,294
Speaker 0: I get benefits.

554
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:18,144
Speaker 0: I get to be around a whole different environment.

555
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:19,930
Speaker 0: It's very academic, very

556
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:20,632
Speaker 0: institutional.".

557
00:42:21,274 --> 00:42:26,109
Speaker 0: I started out there working for the hospital as a kind of a multimedia guy.

558
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,081
Speaker 0: Eventually, I built that up into my own department.

559
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:34,592
Speaker 0: We called it Educational Technology Group.

560
00:42:36,135 --> 00:42:41,270
Speaker 0: I ended up patenting and designing and building all these different applications for medical education.

561
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:44,240
Speaker 0: It was a total experience.

562
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:57,182
Speaker 0: It was an amazing experience because I was fortunate enough to be given all of these opportunities.

563
00:42:57,584 --> 00:43:00,734
Speaker 0: The joke that I had was I'm not a doctor.

564
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:01,758
Speaker 0: I just play when I work.

565
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,631
Speaker 0: I spent three years going through fellowship rotations with surgical fellows.

566
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:14,940
Speaker 0: Here I am, 5 o'clock in the morning in the operating room, dressed in scrubs and watching what these guys do.

567
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,454
Speaker 0: I literally lived my life with these guys and women.

568
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:31,124
Speaker 0: I would produce their educational training programs on how to do a bowel resection or how to do a thyroidectomy or whatever it was.

569
00:43:31,385 --> 00:43:33,393
Speaker 0: These guys were really into technology.

570
00:43:33,433 --> 00:43:34,879
Speaker 0: They were really into multimedia.

571
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:38,187
Speaker 0: A lot of guys programmed their own surgical games.

572
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:40,151
Speaker 0: They did their own videos.

573
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:44,181
Speaker 0: They did all this stuff.

574
00:43:45,103 --> 00:43:47,148
Speaker 0: It was a great experience.

575
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:52,161
Speaker 0: I've seen things that most people never had an opportunity to see.

576
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,007
Speaker 0: I've seen it all.

577
00:43:54,027 --> 00:44:00,305
Speaker 0: Everything that takes place in a hospital, from the heartbreaking to the miraculous.

578
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:02,091
Speaker 0: It was a great experience.

579
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:09,212
Speaker 0: Running my own department was a lot of fun for a long time, but then something called the business of medicine got too big.

580
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:17,637
Speaker 0: It became overwhelming because I had about eight people that worked for me, up to about 45 people.

581
00:44:18,961 --> 00:44:23,780
Speaker 0: I was producing symposia and traveling around the country and lecturing and all that business.

582
00:44:24,443 --> 00:44:27,214
Speaker 0: I just said, "I have to be responsible for the bottom

583
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:27,615
Speaker 0: line.".

584
00:44:27,696 --> 00:44:29,281
Speaker 0: We were a cost recoupment department.

585
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:33,233
Speaker 0: The business of medicine is a rough business.

586
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:36,442
Speaker 0: Medical schools are not designed to make money.

587
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:38,769
Speaker 0: I had to make money.

588
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:43,022
Speaker 0: I had about 80 pharmaceutical companies that were clients of ours.

589
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:49,356
Speaker 0: We would produce multimedia projects for them, everything from games to CD-ROMs to DVDs to web streaming.

590
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:55,133
Speaker 0: I was probably one of the first people in on the web streaming industry.

591
00:44:56,015 --> 00:44:57,238
Speaker 0: I started streaming back in 1998-99.

592
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:02,893
Speaker 0: Back then, the only game in town was real producer and real media.

593
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:04,938
Speaker 0: I got a grant.

594
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:08,606
Speaker 0: I used the money to buy a server.

595
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:12,197
Speaker 0: I spent $10,000 for a real enterprise license.

596
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:14,023
Speaker 0: Of course, now you get everything for free.

597
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:25,979
Speaker 0: You go out and you can buy, not buy, you can get Helix or you can buy the Adobe, the Flash communication server and all these newfangled things.

598
00:45:26,661 --> 00:45:27,886
Speaker 0: Now, it's a whole different world.

599
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:29,692
Speaker 0: I was in on the beginning of that.

600
00:45:29,913 --> 00:45:38,059
Speaker 0: We built up a library of, I don't know, maybe thousands, in the many thousands of materials.

601
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:46,764
Speaker 0: I ended up doing that for a lot of different industries and the medical center and for other hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.

602
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:52,564
Speaker 0: It got to be a real drag because then suddenly I was the bookkeeper.

603
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:58,203
Speaker 0: I was responsible for all this money and that was not, I always wanted to be in the creative side of it.

604
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:05,861
Speaker 0: I formed a company with my cousin and his college buddy.

605
00:46:06,342 --> 00:46:07,644
Speaker 0: They're both Wharton graduates.

606
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:14,383
Speaker 0: My cousin was in sports and sports entertainment.

607
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:18,377
Speaker 0: He worked for Spectacor and he bought and sold baseball teams and all this sort of thing.

608
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:24,518
Speaker 0: My other partner, and he built sports bars and so he was in on the whole retail end of it.

609
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,492
Speaker 0: My other partner, and his name is Scott Barbara.

610
00:46:28,573 --> 00:46:29,558
Speaker 0: We had the same last name.

611
00:46:29,618 --> 00:46:30,482
Speaker 0: Our dads are brothers.

612
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:38,044
Speaker 0: My other partner, Greg O'Connor, is a movie producer, a real life Hollywood movie producer.

613
00:46:38,204 --> 00:46:43,958
Speaker 0: He's also, the thing that gets me about working with both of them is they're both self-made.

614
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:54,750
Speaker 0: Greg put some money together after building up a business with his father, who is a retired police officer.

615
00:46:55,291 --> 00:47:02,201
Speaker 0: They built up a security business together and Greg used that money to finance his first film and that film was Tumbleweeds.

616
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:12,118
Speaker 0: They won a Golden Globe for Tumbleweeds and then they used that money to get a deal with Disney and do their second film, which was Miracle about the Olympic ice hockey team.

617
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:19,160
Speaker 0: They built up this thing, so now Greg's a movie producer and we're all guys from the neighborhood.

618
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:26,428
Speaker 0: We're all like local kids, but we've got to travel all over the world and we've got to consult and do all this different stuff.

619
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:32,073
Speaker 0: In between, there are a bunch of different careers, but this thing that I'm doing with Scott and Greg is called Media Lab.

620
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:43,284
Speaker 0: We invent, I create different products for the entertainment in the industry and the crossovers between entertainment and technology.

621
00:47:43,746 --> 00:47:57,544
Speaker 0: What I do is I try and create virtual reality situations for people to experience and tie that into monetizing it for the entertainment industry and I create applications for the entertainment industry.

622
00:47:57,986 --> 00:47:58,809
Speaker 0: That's a lot of fun.

623
00:48:00,331 --> 00:48:25,614
Speaker 0: Media Lab's been around for about two and a half years, so I transitioned out of Mount Sinai into Media Lab and then I found that since I didn't have the medical center to go to every day and I occasionally do consulting gigs for clients and I work for companies like Stella Productions who do these production projects, I decided that this is the ideal opportunity for me to do this.

624
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,119
Speaker 0: I may not have another opportunity in my life.

625
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:35,073
Speaker 0: I'm in my couple of months, I built the place.

626
00:48:35,794 --> 00:48:49,430
Speaker 0: A lot of sweat equity went into it and just a lot of moral support from family and from my folks who are really good to me and very supportive.

627
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:56,734
Speaker 0: It's been an amazing experience and then getting to know the whole gaming community has been an amazing experience.

628
00:48:56,754 --> 00:49:11,720
Speaker 0: There are websites like KLOV, which is Coin Lovers and there's a website called Tafa, which is T-A-F-A, which is just brochures and then there's so many of these different websites.

629
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,845
Speaker 0: I couldn't even go into all of them.

630
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:25,520
Speaker 0: There's Retroland and there's ... I can't even remember them off the side of my head, but there's so many wonderful places to go and you meet so many people.

631
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:30,919
Speaker 0: It's funny because you find doing the same thing in different ways in life.

632
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:39,715
Speaker 0: I used to travel around the world doing consulting about streaming media and digital video and now I get to travel around the world meeting collectors and doing this.

633
00:49:40,056 --> 00:49:41,381
Speaker 0: This is infinitely more fun.

634
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:47,083
Speaker 0: Although the only difference is that this is on my dime, so that's the big difference.

635
00:49:47,545 --> 00:49:51,495
Speaker 0: Somebody would pay me to go to China 10 years or 15 years ago.

636
00:49:51,515 --> 00:50:00,937
Speaker 0: Now, I have to pay to go on my own, but the first thing is, is the feeling of acquiring a machine.

637
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,405
Speaker 0: It's not so much a selfish feeling.

638
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:15,658
Speaker 0: It's more of ... I feel like I've almost rescued these things from the dumpster or from the ax or from a fire, literally.

639
00:50:16,902 --> 00:50:19,249
Speaker 0: The old game operators, they get tired of these things.

640
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:22,204
Speaker 0: They take them out in the back or they throw them off the back of a truck.

641
00:50:22,244 --> 00:50:23,270
Speaker 0: They'd set them on fire.

642
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,695
Speaker 0: They destroy them.

643
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:25,698
Speaker 0: It was funny to them.

644
00:50:25,758 --> 00:50:30,193
Speaker 0: This was landfill for them, but these are obviously objects of art.

645
00:50:30,213 --> 00:50:30,955
Speaker 0: They really are.

646
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:35,206
Speaker 0: They're living, breathing, working machinery.

647
00:50:35,888 --> 00:50:39,341
Speaker 0: I guess the same way people are addicted to old cars.

648
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:43,999
Speaker 0: People are into cars and they can appreciate every aspect of the car, appreciate this.

649
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:51,850
Speaker 0: The main difference is that even though I collected cars for a while, that was a hobby of mine, I wouldn't let anyone drive my cars.

650
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,295
Speaker 0: These I let people drive.

651
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,183
Speaker 0: These were meant to be driven.

652
00:50:55,203 --> 00:50:57,553
Speaker 0: That was a big hurdle to get over, by the way.

653
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:05,802
Speaker 0: It was very difficult to reconcile letting people touch these things because you're afraid that somebody will abuse it or mishandle it.

654
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:13,724
Speaker 0: Finally, you come to the conclusion that these were designed for one purpose, to entertain.

655
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:16,913
Speaker 0: Now, that's what they're here for.

656
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:18,317
Speaker 0: I keep an eye on them.

657
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:28,507
Speaker 0: They're still my babies, but if people can get a kick out of them, that's the best feeling in the world, to hear the noises of the machines.

658
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:33,363
Speaker 0: I know that everybody is just having a great time when you hear the noises.

659
00:51:33,383 --> 00:51:36,716
Speaker 0: Some people get hooked on one machine.

660
00:51:36,736 --> 00:51:38,023
Speaker 0: There are different kinds of people.

661
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:46,431
Speaker 0: There are people that go from machine to machine and they want a little taste of everything, like the buffet, but then there are the people who get stuck on one thing, like the guy who wants to take all the shrimp.

662
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:52,886
Speaker 0: They have to play Ninja Gun for practically the whole time.

663
00:51:53,407 --> 00:52:05,074
Speaker 0: Then the oddest thing is, here are all these wonderful games and all these toys and everything, and there'll be one person who'll just be stuck at the jukebox for an hour, and they'll just want to pick songs.

664
00:52:05,194 --> 00:52:10,489
Speaker 0: It's been an hour out of two-and-a-half hours just looking for songs and doing that.

665
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:14,136
Speaker 2: What makes a good game?

666
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:20,461
Speaker 0: Storytelling, whether it's film or whether it's video, it's all storytelling.

667
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:21,847
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter how you get there.

668
00:52:21,908 --> 00:52:23,595
Speaker 0: It's if you get there, what you do.

669
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:24,840
Speaker 0: It's storytelling.

670
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,832
Speaker 0: I'd say probably the highest on the list for me is lighting.

671
00:52:27,973 --> 00:52:33,412
Speaker 0: That's the single most important thing of making any kind of image that people see.

672
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:34,936
Speaker 0: Lighting is everything.

673
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,585
Speaker 0: That's followed by sound.

674
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:46,104
Speaker 0: When you're watching a film, it could have good sound or bad sound, and that'll make or break it.

675
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:51,421
Speaker 0: The funny part is it doesn't have to be technically good, the sound.

676
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:53,628
Speaker 0: That's analogous to these games.

677
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:56,399
Speaker 0: They don't have to be technically good to draw you in.

678
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:03,386
Speaker 0: Some of my favorite albums, some of my favorite performers and some of my favorite recordings have the worst sounds.

679
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:05,753
Speaker 0: They were intentionally over-modulated.

680
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:08,198
Speaker 0: The sound is so distorted.

681
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,403
Speaker 0: That was part of the charm of it.

682
00:53:10,584 --> 00:53:19,017
Speaker 0: You listen to these old Zeppelin records or you listen to the old Beatles stuff that was recorded with a couple of microphones on an eight-track.

683
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:21,626
Speaker 0: It sounds better.

684
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,429
Speaker 0: It sounds richer.

685
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:24,636
Speaker 0: It sounds fuller because the performance is there.

686
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,482
Speaker 0: That's the big thing.

687
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:32,103
Speaker 0: Being in film school helps a lot too because these games have a story to them too.

688
00:53:32,524 --> 00:53:34,572
Speaker 0: They all have some kind of theme to them.

689
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:38,306
Speaker 0: Once you master the theme, you sort of master the game.

690
00:53:38,707 --> 00:53:42,544
Speaker 0: There's a certain amount of randomness to them, which makes them different from today's games.

691
00:53:43,006 --> 00:53:51,673
Speaker 0: Today's games are funny because modern video games, you play on a console even though the graphics are amazing and the experience is amazing.

692
00:53:52,895 --> 00:54:00,168
Speaker 0: They're almost surrealistic in their accuracy.

693
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:01,350
Speaker 0: It's scary.

694
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:07,090
Speaker 0: I really think there's going to be a point where people live in a virtual reality world.

695
00:54:08,891 --> 00:54:11,700
Speaker 0: I don't think we're quite there yet, but it's very close.

696
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:15,894
Speaker 0: I'd say maybe 10, 15 years it'll be at that quality.

697
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:27,675
Speaker 0: The only thing that they're lacking is there's the television screen, in my opinion, that creates this impediment or this kind of barrier between you becoming immersed in the game.

698
00:54:28,116 --> 00:54:35,050
Speaker 0: One day when we wear helmets or headsets or whatever that is, when you're really immersed in the game, I think that'll make a big difference.

699
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,458
Speaker 0: I think Wii was a big breakthrough.

700
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:38,362
Speaker 0: I have a Wii.

701
00:54:38,764 --> 00:54:40,190
Speaker 0: I also have a lot of game consoles.

702
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:48,693
Speaker 0: Of course I have the old two-dimensional Atari and television and ColecoVision and Telstar and all that sort of thing.

703
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:56,053
Speaker 0: There was a charm in the two-dimensional and the repetitiveness in that.

704
00:54:58,118 --> 00:55:02,669
Speaker 0: Something about it goes back to comfort foods and everything like that.

705
00:55:02,689 --> 00:55:06,482
Speaker 0: There was a certain comfort in playing those games.

706
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:13,470
Speaker 0: I'll still enjoy them almost as much as I enjoy something new, but now when I play a Wii, that breaks down one of the barriers.

707
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,577
Speaker 0: Now suddenly I'm in another dimension.

708
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:18,950
Speaker 0: It's different from playing against the screen.

709
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,323
Speaker 0: Now suddenly I'm moving my body and I'm having an effect on it.

710
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:24,813
Speaker 0: I still kind of feel that screen in the way.

711
00:55:25,374 --> 00:55:26,277
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is.

712
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:42,103
Speaker 0: As the games get more developed and I don't see my surroundings around me, I think that's the point in which I can say I've abandoned the analog and I've moved into the digital world.

713
00:55:42,143 --> 00:55:43,970
Speaker 0: You can go back to a movie like Tron.

714
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:51,161
Speaker 0: And that was the penultimate in somebody being absorbed into the worlds of video games.

715
00:55:51,181 --> 00:56:00,803
Speaker 0: I think that at some point we'll actually be absorbed into video games.

716
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:18,318
Speaker 0: But if you listen to music on headphones and you really get into an album and nothing else matters and the whole world just goes away and you're connecting with that artist, the same thing can happen with games where for those few moments or for however long it is, there's a connection between you and the machine.

717
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:30,882
Speaker 0: Even though you may not feel the connection and that connection goes as far as either the artist that you're listening to on the music or the person that designed and created the artwork for this thing.

718
00:56:31,323 --> 00:56:36,539
Speaker 0: Suddenly you become part of it and it's three dimensional.

719
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,324
Speaker 0: That's the best part.

720
00:56:38,946 --> 00:56:42,135
Speaker 0: Living in three dimensions, maybe one day we'll have four.

721
00:56:45,384 --> 00:57:00,252
Speaker 0: That's some of the new technology that I developed with Media Lab is that we've created these interactive experiences, these three dimensional experiences where you're not just interacting with the computer but you're interacting with people inside the computer.

722
00:57:00,272 --> 00:57:26,118
Speaker 0: I think it affects the way people respond and the way people interact and the way people let down their guard because suddenly you feel that it's okay to expose yourself because you're communicating with another being somehow, whether it's electronically or in reality.

723
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:30,129
Speaker 0: It's probably a lot easier to communicate with people electronically though, I will say.

724
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:40,101
Speaker 2: This has been Geek Nights with Rem and Scott.

725
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:42,609
Speaker 2: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

727
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:00,835
Speaker 2: We say feeds plural because Geek Nights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

728
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:02,964
Speaker 2: Mondays are science and technology.

729
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:05,635
Speaker 2: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

730
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:11,329
Speaker 2: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

731
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:19,910

737
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:49,784
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

738
00:58:50,186 --> 00:58:53,310
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
