1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,444
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 12th.

2
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:11,185
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,810
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is the geek night.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,248
Speaker 0: Tonight we start to go through the 52.

5
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:23,353
Speaker 0: Ah shit Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:36,170
Speaker 0: So I was buying the book club book on Amazon wind sand and stars by Antoine de saju petty which I'm waiting for a French person to tell me if I'm pronouncing that in in properly or not.

7
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:47,550
Speaker 1: But I was doing the same and I recently bought the brand new the newest newest cheapest cheapest Kindle Mm-hmm, so I thought oh I bought the Kindle because I don't want to carry physical books around.

8
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,797
Speaker 1: I will buy the e-book.

9
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,089
Speaker 1: Guess what book does not have any book?

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,632
Speaker 0: This book.

11
00:00:53,173 --> 00:01:00,635
Speaker 0: so also if it did the Kindle version would probably be more expensive because a brand new copy is $11.

12
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:02,489
Speaker 0: a used copy is way less.

13
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,260
Speaker 1: So I look and I can't get a Kindle version.

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,970
Speaker 1: so I click the button that says tell the publisher you want a Kindle version.

15
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,578
Speaker 1: I know that's not gonna help me out.

16
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:10,603
Speaker 1: Yeah in the short term.

17
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:12,996
Speaker 1: I Go on the Pirate Bay.

18
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:15,170
Speaker 1: I don't find it which is expected.

19
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,705
Speaker 1: I don't expect there to be a brisk trade in piracy of just random books.

20
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:19,810
Speaker 0: It's not random.

21
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:23,650
Speaker 1: It's a very important popular Yeah But it's not a book that picked out at random.

22
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,158
Speaker 1: The majority of people on the internet are seeing.

23
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,985
Speaker 0: imagine there has to be little prints on Kindle.

24
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:28,707
Speaker 0: at least write these.

25
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:34,050
Speaker 0: the other book Double book, but anyway, we're not gonna mention again in the meta moment.

26
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:35,496
Speaker 1: Not again.

27
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:40,870
Speaker 0: No not gonna mention it ever Not in this meta moment of today because he mentioned in the opening bit anyway.

28
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:48,558
Speaker 1: So I go on Google and I type name of the book space ebook First link PDF of the whole book.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:57,348
Speaker 1: Yep, and I now can say that on this Kindle I have 11 project Gutenberg books and one book that I pirated right.

30
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:57,970
Speaker 0: so I was good.

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,219
Speaker 0: I was thinking man.

32
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,662
Speaker 0: I should get it.

33
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,790
Speaker 0: You know, I need free shipping.

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,010
Speaker 1: Let me get a second book right because you think of any book you wanted.

35
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:11,382
Speaker 0: I was thinking you know because of the City massacres monster madness Which you should be watching every day of the month of October you should.

36
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:16,750
Speaker 0: I was thinking hey, I've read the Frankenstein But I haven't read the Dracula Gutenberg.

37
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,473
Speaker 0: so I'm going.

38
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:27,448
Speaker 0: I look for a copy of Dracula and I as soon as I do the search I look at the results and I'm Oh, this is in the public domain, isn't it?

39
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,702
Speaker 0: I went to project Gutenberg and I put it on my iPhone in the iBooks.

40
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:36,459
Speaker 1: Emily recently read it and I was like Oh reading Dracula why and she's like Gutenberg.

41
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was like, oh and then I downloaded it.

42
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:44,390
Speaker 0: So I'm like, well now I need something to fill this fucking cart and I had nothing.

43
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,279
Speaker 0: So I just left it in the cart without buying it.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,130
Speaker 0: and then I got an email from Amazon That was like hey, you got an Amazon credit card and I'm like, yeah, that's why you sent me this email.

45
00:02:52,952 --> 00:03:02,800
Speaker 0: And they're like, you know what if you have an Amazon credit card and you buy some kitchen shit right now with this code 20% off even more off than the regular?

46
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:05,630
Speaker 0: did you buy some Calphalon stuff?

47
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,452
Speaker 0: I don't know not yet But I need to.

48
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:18,370
Speaker 0: I need to buy a kitchen thing to fill up the cart and you if there's nothing you need I want a stayed like eight or nine inch Calphalon omelet pan omelet pan specific.

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,587
Speaker 0: You know the ones are the curves that let you flip over the omelet.

50
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,101
Speaker 1: Yes I don't need.

51
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,990
Speaker 1: I already have a griddle.

52
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:34,693
Speaker 1: I have an iron grill and I have a Calphalon kind of scary worn-out griddle Mm-hmm, and I got that gigantic like Calphalon serving dish broiling everything thing I actually kind of get it.

53
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:39,290
Speaker 0: want to get a stainless steel pan that has these straight sides as opposed to the curved side.

54
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,632
Speaker 1: Why?

55
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:42,708
Speaker 0: because it's better for frying because the oil doesn't come out.

56
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:44,555
Speaker 1: It comes out the same.

57
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:46,902
Speaker 1: get the the shield instead.

58
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kind of want to get one of those pans.

59
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:55,101
Speaker 1: Okay, what you should get is the griddle that has the curvy bits to keep the bacon ever So slightly out of the.

60
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:56,633
Speaker 0: I'm not taking for bacon I'm talking for like.

61
00:03:56,734 --> 00:04:00,010
Speaker 0: when you fill it with like, you know, a few millimeters of oil and go to town.

62
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,861
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't cook like that lately.

63
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:03,350
Speaker 0: I've been doing more of that kind.

64
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:13,105
Speaker 1: I tend to cook less with oil and more with butter a lot of sautee Partly because with Calphalon I don't need the oil for the nonstick.

65
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:13,627
Speaker 0: Well you do.

66
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:16,055
Speaker 0: if you're frying something I don't fry shit anymore.

67
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:17,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm beyond that.

68
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:17,983
Speaker 0: I like to pray.

69
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:18,726
Speaker 1: I do.

70
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:21,997
Speaker 0: I like fried things But I see trying just regular frying pan fry.

71
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:24,003
Speaker 1: I kind of want a deep fryer.

72
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,290
Speaker 0: That's all you I had as a kid.

73
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,188
Speaker 1: We had a fry daddy.

74
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,890
Speaker 1: We just make potato, you know fried potatoes and that's all you.

75
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:35,543
Speaker 1: Okay The only problem with it was kind of scary that when we were done.

76
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,130
Speaker 1: frying the oil would cool down.

77
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,781
Speaker 1: Congeal put a lid on it stick it in the cupboard.

78
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,810
Speaker 1: a month later frying in the same oil.

79
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:46,121
Speaker 1: That's nothing wrong with that no, but it was a little I don't know.

80
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,130
Speaker 1: that oil I think was handed down for my great-grandparents.

81
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,552
Speaker 0: I'm also.

82
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,178
Speaker 0: I was also starting to look at.

83
00:04:51,279 --> 00:05:01,150
Speaker 0: you know, perhaps, you know food process II choppy bits Processor little circle ones that have a chopper chopper and also all the spinny blade also.

84
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe also the Cuisinart the big mix II.

85
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:06,054
Speaker 1: I Don't need the mixing.

86
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,945
Speaker 0: You know what now that's about the biggest one.

87
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:08,930
Speaker 0: That's like the epic one.

88
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,833
Speaker 0: I'm just thinking about the regular.

89
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:13,647
Speaker 1: the majority of our listeners are in high school or college.

90
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:14,389
Speaker 1: None of them.

91
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,710
Speaker 1: Okay, our baking our cooking in any fashion.

92
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:22,648
Speaker 0: I also started looking at perhaps, you know some crafts to do in the winter.

93
00:05:23,652 --> 00:05:28,247
Speaker 1: I watered my lawn the other day mowed it trim the grass did the edges.

94
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,918
Speaker 0: No one cares Anyway, but we'll talk about that another time.

95
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,390
Speaker 0: Okay, then maybe that could be a Thursday bit crafts.

96
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:40,636
Speaker 1: So, of course the New York comic-con is this weekend as news not as a metabit because we're not Doing any panels at it.

97
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:52,710
Speaker 1: if you want to see fan panels at it as far as I can or even most professional panels At least on our level of professional, you know D list celebrity are not in a panel room, but they're on a stage.

98
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:57,449
Speaker 0: Well, the anime ones are in the anime ghetto, which is now on the top floor of the convention center.

99
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,548
Speaker 1: now I recall remember we went to the auto show many years ago during that rainy ass day.

100
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:14,970
Speaker 1: Yep I remember that that top floor which I rarely go to Was basically the equivalent of that like Sun annex at PAX next to the real expo hall Mmm, so that's even sadder than the anime ghetto last year.

101
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, my ghetto is gonna be very sad this year.

102
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:21,073
Speaker 1: I know it's talking about the New York anime festival at all But you have some.

103
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:27,798
Speaker 0: they do have some top to your guests the Makoto shinkai and whatever how Anyway, but I'm gonna show.

104
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:28,965

00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:29,770
Speaker 0: they have an iPhone app.

106
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,995
Speaker 0: It's not so bad and I went through and made a schedule of stuff that I would go to see if I really if I Would really cared.

107
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:38,609
Speaker 0: so they're screening all of my koto shinkai stuff.

108

112
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:57,650
Speaker 0: I got so many press releases about that It was kind of ridiculous, but I guess David Peterson's gonna be on it, which is the only reason to go to it.

113
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:07,998
Speaker 0: Mouse guard was mentioned in the press release But you think is you can just walk up to him at the archaea booth where Luke Crane will also be at certain times Hang selling their box set Mouse Guard RPGs.

144
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,436
Speaker 1: so I feel unethical.

145
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:59,772
Speaker 1: comic-con staff or the read and Comic-con.

146
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,119

148
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:08,005
Speaker 1: Okay now Hasbro My talks with them have been mostly from the perspective of I own your fucking stop.

149
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:09,290
Speaker 1: Stop fucking up your property.

150
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,063
Speaker 1: I own a several hundred actual percent of the shares.

151
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:14,324
Speaker 0: is that?

152
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,070
Speaker 1: oh very little almost nothing.

153
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,006
Speaker 1: So don't give a shit about no, but I'm investor and I complain and I get these.

154
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:24,625
Speaker 1: I get surprisingly The same answers that everyone else gets.

155
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,590
Speaker 1: I guess that's not surprising.

156
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:32,977
Speaker 1: No The answer to everything is we do not have any plans one way or the other for insert Whatever you fucking emailed us about.

157
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:33,660
Speaker 0: that's right.

158
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:41,453
Speaker 1: But anyway, uh With the best I can share in terms of My Little Pony is that I Warned.

159
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:41,775
Speaker 1: I don't know.

160
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:50,930
Speaker 1: five or six different people throughout read exhibitions And the people who run the New York comic-con and said hey I know you're talking to the franchise people and I know you're talking to Hasbro.

161
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,105
Speaker 0: Hasbro's got a big-ass booth on the map and they got a panel.

162
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,958
Speaker 1: I said and I quote Trust me on this.

163
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,448
Speaker 1: I know it sounds crazy.

164
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:02,421
Speaker 1: add My Little Pony friendship is magic to the list of franchises.

165
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:11,650
Speaker 1: You want talent merchandise and or Your product stuff from and I don't think anyone actually followed through on that.

166
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,783
Speaker 1: Which is what's funny is that I told them this before ponies became internet crazy.

167
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:17,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was a long time ago.

168
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:28,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if there isn't the pony stuff you expected the con It's pretty much Hasbro and or the New York comic-con's fault and not any lack of people telling you They so dumb.

169
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:29,682
Speaker 0: The thing is the people.

170
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:40,164
Speaker 0: it's like if you it's like I'm digging in a mine I'm Hasbro mining for money by making toys and I find some gold and Everyone walks down is like gold gold and I'm just like yeah fuck that gold.

171
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:40,706
Speaker 1: I'm mining.

172
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:41,790
Speaker 1: I'm looking for silver.

173
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the ticket.

174
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:43,920
Speaker 0: overs the ticket.

175
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:47,938
Speaker 0: I haven't found any yet, but I'll let you know There's so much gold here.

176
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,087
Speaker 0: dig it up and fuck that gold studio.

177
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:50,850
Speaker 0: I don't like yellow.

178
00:10:50,930 --> 00:11:03,179
Speaker 1: It's funny because a year ago when I was talking to you know people in the industry about My Little Pony I'd basically present it on the lines of look I know this sounds crazy But people with money are interested in this franchise.

179
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,181
Speaker 1: you could make some money off of them and I thought you know the rationalizations I gave to these people were pretty.

180
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,770
Speaker 1: I was reaching a little bit.

181
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,065
Speaker 1: I did not expect it to get as big as it got.

182
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:18,705
Speaker 0: to be perfectly honest There's a handmade Fluttershy plushie going for six hundred and forty dollars on eBay.

183
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:20,030
Speaker 1: You know, what's fucked up.

184
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:27,321
Speaker 1: I clicked on that and when it was only six hundred thirty dollars for a second, I thought you know, I Didn't do it.

185
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,185
Speaker 0: All right, let's move on let's get to this anyway your comic-con will be there.

186
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,590
Speaker 0: stuff's going on right real quick.

187
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:59,390
Speaker 0: This is article pretty interesting from the BBC about You know how people act when they're drunk and it basically it's an anthropologist and she talks about how look There's some things that are caused by alcohol directly narrowing a vision Short-term memory loss, you know worse coordination worse muscle control worse reaction time Inability to speak clearly etc, but alcohol does not cause.

188
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:08,909
Speaker 0: cause you to break social rules such as Sleeping around with people or you know act in a fool going crazy getting into fights anything like that.

189
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,501
Speaker 0: alcohol does not directly cause that chemically.

190
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:12,788
Speaker 0: what causes that?

191
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:17,638
Speaker 0: is Your cultural belief that alcohol causes that.

192
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:25,159
Speaker 1: ah what I've said all along about Unsober, well, it's not except.

193
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,124
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not.

194
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:27,190
Speaker 0: that's not what it is at all.

195
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:36,610
Speaker 0: It's that you're in a culture and your culture believes, you know Let's say American culture or Canadian culture believes that alcohol causes people to get violent.

196
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:45,188
Speaker 0: If you're caught if you believe that then drinking alcohol Well will cause you to be violent because you believe that it will happen.

197
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,514
Speaker 1: now We had a Scott.

198
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:50,130
Speaker 1: will it still cause that if you tell someone about this study first?

199
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:51,193
Speaker 0: I don't know.

200
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,482
Speaker 1: I'm really curious if I mean what theoretically.

201
00:12:54,502 --> 00:13:03,449
Speaker 0: but the thing is if we believe that eating Twizzlers cause people to shit themselves, right?

202
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,170
Speaker 0: Diarrhea that you know cause, you know people to lose bowel control then people would eat Twizzlers and shit themselves.

203
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,888
Speaker 0: It would happen right if we culturally if everyone sort of believed that as a cultural thing.

204
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:15,510
Speaker 1: That's my point.

205
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:22,790
Speaker 1: I'm curious if there is an effect if people know about the effect because if that were true You could inoculate people against the effect.

206
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,903
Speaker 0: the thing is I actually I would guess that it knowing wouldn't help you.

207
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,530
Speaker 0: the same way that like knowing a Placebo is a placebo.

208
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:38,890
Speaker 1: but what if for example you Show someone all this research about Russians and viewers of Russians being drunk and acting in their particular Russian way?

209
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:42,485
Speaker 1: Could you change someone's social perception to where they act like a different kind of?

210
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:49,630
Speaker 0: I think you'd have to have like You know to change the whole cultural belief which is farther deep down than the surface, but I wonder how deep it is.

211
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:56,650
Speaker 0: But you know, but it's like they look and it's like well look Italians Don't get this way when they're drunk because they have a different kind of you know.

212
00:13:57,091 --> 00:14:02,486
Speaker 0: And basically what it comes down to is what we have is we have us and England.

213
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:12,819
Speaker 0: We have an ambivalent drinking culture whereas other societies like Mediterranean ones and Latin ones they have a What is known as in?

214
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:13,989
Speaker 0: where's the word?

215
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,990
Speaker 0: Integrated drinking culture?

216
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:22,830
Speaker 0: Right, which is why they act differently and in fact the integrated drinking cultures drink more than the ambivalent ones like us.

217
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,933
Speaker 0: It's just we go crazy when we drink and they don't.

218
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,080
Speaker 1: so things of the day.

219
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:41,670
Speaker 1: This is just a Norwegian soldier because you know in Norway you pretty much have to be in the military for some time But we all get into all the details there.

220
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,240
Speaker 1: You can read about it on the Wikipedia.

221
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:52,480
Speaker 1: But this one particular Norwegian soldier Makes a face every time a cameras pointed at him and there's something about this face.

222
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,220
Speaker 0: He's making the best of a situation.

223
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:03,597
Speaker 1: There is something about this guy that I find utterly hilarious and I defy you To watch this entire video and not laugh out loud at some point.

224
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:04,119
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

225
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:07,340
Speaker 0: So here's someone made a flash game called mega mash.

226
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:08,985
Speaker 0: This is amazing.

227
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,690
Speaker 0: This is a new kind of video game.

228
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:11,793
Speaker 0: It's epic.

229
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:12,676
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

230
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:13,880
Speaker 0: You got to play this fucking thing.

231
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,519
Speaker 0: Why is it like they could have made a ton of money if they would have made this like a downloadable steam Xbox Live game.

232
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:23,360
Speaker 0: The fact that they made it a flash game that's free is crazy.

233
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,820
Speaker 0: Somebody should take this concept and sort of make it bigger and HD and put it on steam and Xbox Live to make a killing.

234
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:33,203
Speaker 0: Oh my god, this is the greatest Play this shit.

235
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:33,926
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

236
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:37,420
Speaker 0: This isn't a video game like no other video game that has existed that I've ever seen.

237
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,431
Speaker 1: It's like alright it did that kind of cliche thing.

238
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:42,113
Speaker 1: I see what they're doing.

239
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:51,080
Speaker 1: I'm see what the oh, oh Yeah, yeah, I want someone to take this and embrace it extend it and make an expert for met a moment.

240
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
Speaker 0: We already covered the book club in the upcoming con.

241
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,371
Speaker 0: I just want to say check us out on the internets for our crew.

00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:17,146
Speaker 0: that's how we roll and Along those lines.

249
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:27,160
Speaker 1: if you want us to appear at a convention or school or whatever and money no No, no, don't tell us because too many people say oh you should go to X convention.

250
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,524
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna put any effort into that.

251
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:33,240
Speaker 1: tell the convention if an actual organization that's doing a thing approaches us.

252
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:43,480
Speaker 0: We are much more likely to respond For transportation in hotel rooms If they can offer only badges, but they better be fucking close to us or badass.

253
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,360
Speaker 1: I mean mag fest does not need to pay me to go there.

254
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,389
Speaker 1: I would go there even if I was not a guest.

255
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:48,871
Speaker 0: that's true.

256
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,759
Speaker 1: All right X does not need to pay me to go there.

257
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,426
Speaker 0: So what was your thing today?

258
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:54,290
Speaker 1: I did it.

259
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:55,254
Speaker 0: I forget what it was.

260
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:56,539
Speaker 1: I forgot what it was already.

261
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,656
Speaker 1: Yes, you really already forgot about the way, you know region.

262
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:02,545
Speaker 0: All right Norwegian guy good Alright.

263
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:14,040
Speaker 0: so to reiterate we've talked about this before on the show But you know something I've always complained about with superhero comics specifically the DC and the Marvel is that they are Incomprehensible to normal people who don't know anything about them.

264
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:21,180
Speaker 0: I mean people have a surface level knowledge of say Batman Superman spider-man from comic from movies and TV, but that's about it.

265
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:28,933
Speaker 0: So reading comics is something only for nerds and they make all these comics You know for a very small audience and it's this horrible thing.

266
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:38,489
Speaker 0: and they should just fucking throw all their incomprehensible history out the window and restart from number one and from the beginning and Just make us any normal person can understand.

267
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:43,420
Speaker 0: and not you know, Marvel did it with the ultimate comics But no do it with the real comics just go for it.

268
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:50,359
Speaker 0: so DC announced this big relaunch that they were gonna undo all their comics and just start with number one of everything.

269
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,579
Speaker 0: and So they did in the month of sip.

270
00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:03,383
Speaker 0: Well actually starting at the end of August they put out Justice League number one and all through the month of September They released 51 more comics for a total of 52 brand-new number one comics.

271
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:09,926
Speaker 0: every single DC comic has been reset to number one will relaunched and It was a big deal really big deal.

272
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,471
Speaker 0: So cuz it was such a big deal.

273
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:15,485
Speaker 0: There was a special deal a Special value deal.

274
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:18,840
Speaker 0: I could buy all of those number one comics for 80 bucks.

275
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:19,926
Speaker 0: So I did.

276
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:25,593
Speaker 0: for the good of geek nights and for the good of you guys We will now begin going through them all 52 of the comics.

277
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,364
Speaker 0: We'll see how long this takes.

278
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:29,969
Speaker 0: It'll probably take multiple episodes.

279
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:36,259
Speaker 0: Maybe to keep the Wednesday episodes free for other things You might have to put them in special episode might revisit the.

280
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:36,902
Speaker 1: well We'll figure.

281
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:40,740
Speaker 0: maybe we'll do Wednesday episodes every week until we got a board thing to know.

282
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:49,379
Speaker 1: We've been especially made because you know me I tend to get Three panels into most underwear pervert comics and be like fuck this.

283
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:53,396
Speaker 0: But we forced ourselves to read every word on every page of every one of these.

284
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:54,340
Speaker 0: I even made a chart.

285
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:59,160
Speaker 0: I counted the number of content pages ad pages house ad pages.

286
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,691
Speaker 0: I. I wrote down the prices of all of them.

287
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:06,931
Speaker 0: We did a full complete Investigation into this whole thing for you.

288
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:11,400
Speaker 1: So before we get into the individual comics Let's talk about some trends like the general matter.

289
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:19,618
Speaker 1: Uh, I mean I was thinking about talking about trends when I came to them But there are a lot of trends one very specifically because you brought it up on the ads and the non-comic content.

290
00:19:19,678 --> 00:19:26,751
Speaker 1: So My perception Reading these is that there were an infinite number of fucking ads.

291
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:30,320
Speaker 1: there were so many that like I was kind of amazed.

292
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:34,556
Speaker 0: Okay, the vast majority of the books according to my count had 21 content pages.

293
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:39,331
Speaker 0: I counted the cover as a content page that I'll accept that.

294
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,480
Speaker 0: Okay, so 20 pages of actual comic panels.

295
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:46,659
Speaker 0: Usually you're getting a one or two two page spreads right going on in there.

296
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:54,810
Speaker 0: They also had depending on what week as the weeks went on see I Separated the ads into ads and house ads.

297
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:04,769
Speaker 0: house ads were ads for DC comics Which also included those final three pages at the end of every book where they sort of did like, you know The newsy crap going on back there.

298
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:11,020
Speaker 0: All right, and also, you know, for example Here's an ad for Wonder Woman number one in Justice League number one.

299
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,713
Speaker 0: That's a house ad but is an ad for onion news.

300
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:15,240
Speaker 0: That is not a house ad.

301
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:20,942
Speaker 0: The thing is even the house ads except for the deus ex one and the onion one actually included superheroes Like.

302
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,609
Speaker 0: here's an ad for converse shoes.

303
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:23,573
Speaker 0: That's not a house ad.

304
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,220
Speaker 0: so it's got Batman all over it.

305
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,699
Speaker 1: I had a problem with the converse as I wonder if you had the same thing that I knew they were there.

306
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:34,400
Speaker 1: But every comic I was reading I'd be reading the panels and I hit the next page to my right and I'd be like Batman.

307
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,802
Speaker 1: What's it?

308
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:37,653
Speaker 1: Oh, it's the ad right every time it got me.

309
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:38,456
Speaker 1: I'd be like Batman.

310
00:20:38,497 --> 00:20:40,404
Speaker 0: They do that on purpose Fuck you.

311
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:46,372
Speaker 0: But anyway in there in the most of the books That were 20 pages of kind of 21 pages of content.

312
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:50,647
Speaker 0: counting the cover there were about 15 ish ad pages.

313
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:56,269
Speaker 0: So you are getting slightly more content than ad but Not that much.

314
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,380
Speaker 1: That's a pretty bad ratio.

315
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,976
Speaker 1: The other question I have for you is where are there more ads in the comics involving Batman?

316
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:03,260
Speaker 1: or was that just my perception?

317
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,699
Speaker 0: It depends on the book, right?

318
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,279
Speaker 0: So some of the real some of the books cost four dollars, for example action comics, which we're gonna talk about real soon.

319
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,783
Speaker 1: I didn't know they were different prices There were.

320
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:16,400
Speaker 0: there were a handful of books that were four dollars instead of three dollars.

321
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,772
Speaker 0: Those ones did have much more content pages.

322
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:22,040
Speaker 0: For example All Star Western was a four dollar book.

323
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,620
Speaker 0: It had 29 pages of content included.

324
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:29,216
Speaker 0: It also had the same about the same number of ads 14 ads.

325
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:34,140
Speaker 0: So when you paid more for a book you got more content without getting more ads.

326
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:34,858
Speaker 1: All right.

327
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:45,833
Speaker 0: The other thing is that books involving, you know, the bigger heroes right the more popular books tended to have More ad ads and less house ads.

328
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:50,206
Speaker 0: for example plain old Batman Had actually less ads.

329
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:58,506
Speaker 0: overall it still cost three dollars was 25 content pages including the cover eight ads But only three house ads.

330
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:03,140
Speaker 0: so only 11 ad pages total in in the regular Batman book.

331
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,144
Speaker 0: So they sacrificed.

332
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:12,597
Speaker 0: but because they're more popular books, right the books with bigger characters in them They were able to have more regular ads and less house ads.

333
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:23,040
Speaker 0: also books in later weeks once you got to week for you know week for a Lot less house ads because a lot of the house ads were for books in later weeks.

334
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:35,599
Speaker 0: So the early weeks had more house ads to get you to buy the books for the rest of the month Whereas in the rest of the month They actually had a lot more regular ads for other things or a lot more pages of regular ads for other things,

335
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:35,960
Speaker 1: huh?

336
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,350
Speaker 0: So yeah, those are those are the general trends.

337
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:42,854
Speaker 0: once we finish this spreadsheet I'll make it the public on the Google Docs so you can all enjoy.

338
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have a ranking system.

339
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,144
Speaker 0: We haven't quite worked out my rank my personal ranking system I guess before we begin.

340
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:50,113
Speaker 0: it was good meh and bad.

341
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:53,669
Speaker 1: mine was worth the time It took to read it worth the money.

342
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,060
Speaker 1: It would have taken to buy it worth nothing.

343
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:58,331
Speaker 0: So what I mean by Meg good and bad.

344
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:05,457
Speaker 0: bad is I would not read it Even if you gave it to me for as a gift, it's so bad Meh is like.

345
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:09,877
Speaker 0: well I would read it if it was just lying there for free and I really had nothing better to do.

346
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:16,438
Speaker 0: and Good is I will buy the trade paperback at least the first one based on this one issue, right?

347
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,087
Speaker 0: I would never buy under any circumstances.

348
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,197
Speaker 0: Not a single one of these comics in this.

349
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,840
Speaker 1: for oh my god Don't get me started.

350
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:32,699
Speaker 1: So I always complain about the format of comics But I have to take it to a new level because I have never Had to read since I was a little kid many of them in a row.

351
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:33,743
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

352
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:38,660
Speaker 0: There are people who will buy who are buying this stack of 52 comics every single month.

353
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:46,400
Speaker 0: They so far I could have if I wanted to gotten Did all the twos all the threes and all the fours for the same price through DCB service?

354
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,499
Speaker 0: We could have had an equivalent stack Every single my god, and there are people who get that stack every month and read through the whole thing.

355
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,410
Speaker 1: So I'm where am I gonna read these?

356
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:58,260
Speaker 1: mostly on the subway?

357
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,011
Speaker 1: So it take you know, my subway ride.

358
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:04,915
Speaker 1: I can read two or three of them So I need to carry at least like six with me.

359
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:13,680
Speaker 1: Yep Holding more than one of these in my hand at the same time and trying to read one is a disaster waiting to happen.

360
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:19,280
Speaker 1: Keep the other ones in your bag and swap them, but that's such a pain in the ass in a crowded ass subway.

361
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:21,514
Speaker 0: I wish that they would just release one big.

362
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:26,780
Speaker 0: if they released Even though I'm gonna be honest the majority of them the vast majority were bad and mad.

363
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,466
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to release a Japanese style.

364
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,051
Speaker 0: if they really compilation.

365
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:34,059
Speaker 1: if it was one giant motherfucking book I would subscribe to that.

366
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:37,940
Speaker 0: I would subscribe to that shit, even though the majority of that book would be bad or mad.

367
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:38,504
Speaker 0: I would.

368
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:40,460
Speaker 0: he probably paid 20 bucks a month for that.

369
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,764
Speaker 1: I think I would do for this 52.

370
00:24:41,764 --> 00:24:48,570
Speaker 0: if for this 52 if I would have been one big-ass fucking book even Separate it into two big-ass fucking books.

371
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,840
Speaker 0: put on the Batman books in one and all the other ones.

372
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:52,606
Speaker 1: That's about accurate.

373
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:57,010
Speaker 0: All right, and then you know just charge 15 bucks for each book.

374
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:00,729
Speaker 1: I Might get just the Batman book at that point, but we'll see.

375
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,050
Speaker 0: Yeah.

376
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,680
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think we're gonna have quite differing opinions.

377
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,423
Speaker 0: Let's go into it.

378
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:06,372
Speaker 0: All right, so we'll get to the other trends.

379
00:25:06,392 --> 00:25:08,300
Speaker 0: when we come to them go right down the list.

380
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:10,519
Speaker 0: Let's recap Justice League a little bit.

381
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:11,483
Speaker 0: I already did.

382
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:15,800
Speaker 0: we already talked about this on a show, but I do want to say the art was Jim Lee.

383
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:16,482
Speaker 0: It was great.

384
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:17,988
Speaker 1: I actually really liked the art.

385
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:21,180
Speaker 1: I really liked that shot of Superman in the last panel.

386
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,080
Speaker 0: I like the colors a lot too high because he had this look on his face.

387
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:27,695
Speaker 1: I like how Superman's personality is kind of a fuck you.

388
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:28,378
Speaker 1: I'm Superman.

389
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:28,860
Speaker 0: That's right.

390
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,105
Speaker 0: I like that and I also liked how even this was a true Number one.

391
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:45,380
Speaker 0: it starts off where like Batman doesn't even know Green Lantern at all Even though it says here five years ago Which is important because this Justice League now having read the other books Makes no sense if it's taking place at the same time as the other ones.

392
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:56,144
Speaker 0: So this Justice League was actually five years ago Which actually kind of makes me want to read it more a little bit even though I still put it in the met category Because that you know.

393
00:25:56,244 --> 00:26:00,300
Speaker 0: it has nothing to do with these other ones you get sort of the five-year lead-up that go.

394
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,441
Speaker 0: It's the prequel to all the other 51.

395
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:06,700
Speaker 1: Yep, I also really like how it did not start with origin story.

396
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,620
Speaker 1: It started in media res so that because I feel like cuz I don't want the origin story.

397
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:15,978
Speaker 1: It's all these 52. imagine if every one of these was the origin story of some super.

398
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:17,532
Speaker 1: be awful I couldn't have dealt with them.

399
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:18,058
Speaker 0: No, I don't know.

400
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:25,080
Speaker 0: So yeah So Justice League gets the met the high met even and probably the first Jeff John's book I've ever said is not bad.

401
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,300
Speaker 1: I would read it if it was presented to me.

402
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,596
Speaker 1: It is definitely worth the time to read because I enjoyed Superman.

403
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:32,680
Speaker 1: I enjoyed Batman.

404
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,990
Speaker 1: Okay, Green Lantern is still really stupid.

405
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:38,102
Speaker 0: All right, so now let's go to week one Action.

406
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:40,990
Speaker 0: action comics number one number one.

407
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:43,035
Speaker 0: Actually, you're gonna be surprised.

408
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:43,797
Speaker 0: action comics.

409
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:44,840
Speaker 0: I put this in the good.

410
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:46,866
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy trade number one.

411
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:49,013
Speaker 1: I actually kind of liked it to though.

412
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,340
Speaker 1: I'm kind of angry about the art.

413
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:55,320
Speaker 0: I don't know if I would buy trade number two, but I'll buy trade number one.

414
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,504
Speaker 1: So the art was lazy.

415
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:58,893
Speaker 0: The art was not amazing art.

416
00:26:59,094 --> 00:27:00,399
Speaker 0: There were many books in here, right?

417
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,222
Speaker 0: That were.

418
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:02,448
Speaker 0: the art blew me away.

419
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:04,580
Speaker 1: Oh, no, but the art on this one pissed me off right away.

420
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:05,720
Speaker 0: I didn't piss me off.

421
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,225
Speaker 1: The first two panels pissed me off.

422
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:15,934
Speaker 0: panel one is two guys in a kind of awkward pose Having conversation and the second panel is exact same panel with the Reds swoosh coming.

423
00:27:15,954 --> 00:27:21,948
Speaker 1: Yes, but they continued their conversation and Come on like that.

424
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:30,780
Speaker 1: just the fact that they're having this kind of actual conversation They like they make a point like IT - I'm teetotal and their expressions literally don't change.

425
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:33,720
Speaker 1: They're like their hands are still touching their faces in the same space.

426
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,894
Speaker 1: Just it really looked like some kind of the lower rent comics.

427
00:27:37,994 --> 00:27:41,170
Speaker 0: I tend to read sometimes Yeah, I mean that this didn't.

428
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:47,615
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say this is bad art But it's pretty much typical comic art completely average for what superhero comics are.

429
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:49,140
Speaker 0: I also didn't blow me away.

430
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:56,913
Speaker 1: I had a lot of trouble following what was going on in the action scenes Kind of not so much like you did.

431
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:01,275
Speaker 0: the overall plot though Definitely made sense, which is good compared to a lot of these other books.

432
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:02,260
Speaker 1: It mostly made sense.

433
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:05,197
Speaker 1: I really liked Lex Luthor like the way he was drawn and the way he talked.

434
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:05,760
Speaker 1: He was really fun.

435
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,110
Speaker 0: What I most liked about this right was that Superman?

436
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,390
Speaker 0: this really isn't a Superman book at least not the Superman That's been in a lot of other recent books.

437
00:28:14,812 --> 00:28:19,950
Speaker 0: This Superman is basically Robocop Right only without the restrictions that Robocop has.

438
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:20,934
Speaker 0: he doesn't have any directives.

439
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:23,586
Speaker 0: He's just like yeah, you're bad I'm gonna fuck you over.

440
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:25,395
Speaker 0: I don't give back your shit about the police.

441
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,320
Speaker 0: I'm coming to fuck you up.

442
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, bad businessman.

443
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:27,848
Speaker 0: Guess what?

444
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take you and drop you over fucking building.

445
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,180
Speaker 1: That's right, and it's like they're like, ah, he broke his hip and Superman just like hey, I was Superman.

446
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:41,759
Speaker 0: I would probably be pretty close to this Superman which is sort of a fantasy fulfillment sort of Mary Sue situation.

447
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:43,495
Speaker 0: now It's but I don't give a fuck.

448
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:43,960
Speaker 0: I like it.

449
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,059
Speaker 1: No, no, cuz it leads into an interesting direction of Superman doesn't give a shit.

450
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,093
Speaker 1: But what if you know the consequences of his actions?

451
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:51,500
Speaker 1: cause right other?

452
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,481
Speaker 1: Consequences.

453
00:28:52,522 --> 00:29:01,311
Speaker 0: the other thing I really like about it is that this seems to be a lot like the original Action comics, you know 1930 whatever Superman he can only jump.

454
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,280
Speaker 1: he can't fly but he's getting stronger.

455
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,170
Speaker 1: I think he's getting to the point where he will fly.

456
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:09,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, he in all the other books I was sort of like oh he's flying.

457
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:12,459
Speaker 0: this isn't the same I wish I was like every other book that had Superman in it.

458
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,420
Speaker 0: I was wishing that it was the action comic Superman because this is the first one I read.

459
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,139
Speaker 0: Well the second book I read right?

460
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:21,780
Speaker 0: So I was hoping that the all the other books had action comic Superman.

461
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,871
Speaker 0: But if you read the Superman book, it doesn't have action comic Superman.

462
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:36,792
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like, ah, damn it, but actually While it was disappointing not to have the awesome vulnerable can only jump can't fly Just grabs rich people and throws them off buildings.

463
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:38,860
Speaker 0: action comic Superman in the other books.

464
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:52,537
Speaker 0: It gives me hope that maybe this action comics will be separate from those other books and it Itself will be much more readable Which is I think the thing that broke the camel's back and moved it over from mad to good.

465
00:29:52,858 --> 00:30:04,432
Speaker 1: the only Hope other than the kind of lazy art in some of the panels was that the the every part of the plot made sense But the way the train thing unfolded was a little weird.

466
00:30:04,452 --> 00:30:06,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the the panels didn't really make sense.

467
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,560
Speaker 1: There was a little bit of Naito in there a little bit like it jumped back and forth.

468
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,226
Speaker 1: I'm like, wait, who's he calling?

469
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:16,783
Speaker 1: You just yelled two names of people and you're drawn kind of derpily Are you?

470
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:17,688
Speaker 1: oh you're saying your own?

471
00:30:17,828 --> 00:30:19,296
Speaker 1: Okay, you said your own name there.

472
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:24,539
Speaker 1: I see what's going on But anyway, why that guy have a gun and then like they just like everyone in the subway Just like or the train just like grabbed him.

473
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,300
Speaker 1: But yet I thought was he gonna die on the train with why it didn't make sense.

474
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,200
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for this book to get exciting when the kryptonite comes into play.

475
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:34,873
Speaker 1: I just want to see Lex Luthor fuck shit up that too.

476
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:36,600
Speaker 1: He was really funny like the way he's.

477
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:40,909
Speaker 0: Hmm Yeah, he was definitely messing around with those government guys.

478
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:41,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

479
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:47,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's written by Grant Morrison who is a notoriously Love or hate guy with the superhero fans.

480
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:53,340
Speaker 0: I haven't really read too much by him even though he's still famous But I like this one and the art is by rags Morales.

481
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,271
Speaker 0: So I know nothing about other than that is a name.

482
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:58,460
Speaker 0: I have heard of someone who does comic art.

483
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,800
Speaker 0: Apparently he's popular enough to do action comics number one, but the art was not so great.

484
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:07,239
Speaker 1: Okay, so yeah for me to put it on you know, what worth the money, I think I want to.

485
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,571
Speaker 0: I'm buying trade number one when it's listed.

486
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:10,456
Speaker 1: I will read it.

487
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:10,938
Speaker 1: All right.

488
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:21,471
Speaker 0: Yes Now we move to animal man, which is notable because Jeff Lemire high hopes based on the Jeff Lemire name, but I never heard of Travel Foreman or Dan Green who did the art?

489
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:28,253
Speaker 0: I did not research them at all either Yeah, but when I looked at this art, I kind of liked it.

490
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,075
Speaker 1: I do too.

491
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:34,220
Speaker 0: It's not like oh my god This is amazing art, but it was definitely different from all the other books.

492
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,740
Speaker 0: Which is you know to just to do a different style makes me happy.

493
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:43,113
Speaker 1: I also like how it had Watchmen style text at the beginning Yeah, and those black and white pages.

494
00:31:43,174 --> 00:31:51,745
Speaker 1: when you got to that part I was like, oh shit son though kids if you skipped that first page with just text from a newspaper You're reading comics wrong.

495
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:52,327
Speaker 0: That's right.

496
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:58,360
Speaker 0: I think a lot of the ultra hardcore fans probably skip that page Maybe and I liked how it then it shows you on page two.

497
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,830
Speaker 0: You know animal man is reading that page.

498
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,420
Speaker 0: you just read which makes it even cooler, right?

499
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:11,197
Speaker 0: Yep, imagine if like in Watchmen when you see like that, you know history of the Minuteman and then like our man was reading it Like in his you know, that'd be cool.

500
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:17,460
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I I really like this one because that last panel I did not expect that to be where this was going.

501
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,031
Speaker 0: That was let me remember what the last panel was.

502
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:22,060
Speaker 1: She's like, I just wanted a pet dad.

503
00:32:22,221 --> 00:32:24,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't see that one coming along at all.

504
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:24,991
Speaker 1: That was shit.

505
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,600
Speaker 1: I am really this is straight-up worth the money.

506
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,918
Speaker 0: I will read all of this until the thing about that the whole book as a whole that I like the most.

507
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,140
Speaker 0: obviously It's the book has a mess, you know an animal a pro animal message to push.

508
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,759
Speaker 1: But so what is the message though?

509
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:47,227
Speaker 1: Because it seems to be partly that maybe like there's something primal and perhaps Morally ambivalent about it.

510
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:54,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing that I liked about it the most was that it had the Normal family dynamic right.

511
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:57,580
Speaker 0: a lot of books, you know when they got a family in there or something like that.

512
00:32:57,764 --> 00:32:58,500
Speaker 0: It's not normal.

513
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:05,439
Speaker 0: But the animal man was totally acting like a normal dude and his family acted like normal people at the dialogue was.

514
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:08,137
Speaker 1: it wasn't Dialogue it wasn't one-liners.

515
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:15,620
Speaker 0: It wasn't Over dramaticized soap opera dialogue like, you know or melodramatic corny bullshit.

516
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,571
Speaker 0: It was he was hanging with his family the way he would.

517
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:29,788
Speaker 0: you would hang with a family if you were animal man and he was you know, the fact that he just acted like such, you know, a normal person would reasonably act in his Extraordinary circumstances was pretty cool.

518
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:34,080
Speaker 0: And I'm really gonna be excited to see how he reacts to the extraordinary circumstances of that last battle.

519
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:42,160
Speaker 1: I am also very happy that while it is clearly in the universe of the rest of this BS None of that BS appears to be ready to overlap.

520
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:48,300
Speaker 0: Yeah There was no appearing of you know, Batman's or Superman's even though it's clearly in the DC Universe.

521
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:50,129
Speaker 0: None of that came into the play.

522
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,350
Speaker 0: Yep.

523
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:54,045
Speaker 1: They paid lip service to it with Oh, yeah, all the other superheroes.

524
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:55,871
Speaker 0: every book every single book.

525
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:58,720
Speaker 0: in the whole 52 paid some amount of lip service to it.

526
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,974
Speaker 0: There is none that had zero lip service.

527
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:01,920
Speaker 0: Not that I could find.

528
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,547
Speaker 0: But yeah animal man Jeff Lemire.

529
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:06,935
Speaker 0: He did not disappoint at least not in this case.

530
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:08,159
Speaker 0: Can't go wrong.

531
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,529
Speaker 1: Okay, wait and not in this case.

532
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:11,179
Speaker 1: you're thinking about Frankenstein.

533
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,204
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that one.

534
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:14,728
Speaker 0: Later the other Jeff Lemire book.

535
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:15,330
Speaker 0: He did two books.

536
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,880
Speaker 0: All right back girl also to 99.

537
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,955
Speaker 1: So wasn't this supposed to be number one?

538
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:24,799
Speaker 1: no Previous BS or anything yet?

539
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:32,036
Speaker 1: It is clearly following on from Killing Joke the spinal injury her powers all that stuff and you know.

540
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:36,199
Speaker 0: to give a credit though You don't have to know those things to understand the book, right?

541
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,463
Speaker 0: There are some books where you have to know what came before to understand it at all like Green Lantern But don't get this.

542
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:47,962
Speaker 0: but in this one you you know knowing about Killing Joke gives it more meaning gives you a bigger emotional Definitely.

543
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:48,243
Speaker 1: I'll get.

544
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:50,129
Speaker 0: it probably enhances the enjoyment.

545
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:56,577
Speaker 1: say throw out to the fans like hey guys, but at the same time It's not necessary to know that to understand this book.

546
00:34:56,658 --> 00:35:03,440
Speaker 1: pretending I did not know that and reading this it was explained enough to be irrelevant as to why it is there.

547
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,016
Speaker 0: But the thing is you do sort of have to know that there's a guy named Batman.

548
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:09,180
Speaker 0: He's in Gotham City.

549
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:12,940
Speaker 0: He's Batman and the coach the commissioners name is Commissioner Gordon.

550
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:19,097
Speaker 0: If you don't know those things then you will not understand pretty much any bat book in the whole freaking.

551
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:24,795
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say one thing I am really against you know, any of these not just being drop me in start reading.

552
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:32,960
Speaker 1: I don't need to do anything, but I Almost want to give Batman a pass because I as everyone knows at least the basics of Batman.

553
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,774
Speaker 0: He's Bruce Wayne, you know, his parents were killed.

554
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:45,275
Speaker 0: these basic facts I mean at least if you're a nerd even if you're not a superhero nerd, you know those things Yeah, and even if you're not a superhero nerd my parents know who fucking Batman is.

555
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:45,696
Speaker 0: That's right.

556
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:46,640
Speaker 0: My parents know it, too.

557
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:47,940
Speaker 1: They know who Commissioner Gordon is.

558
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,667
Speaker 1: They might not know he has a daughter.

559
00:35:49,908 --> 00:35:53,606
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't know he has a daughter or any of that But they'll catch on when it's.

560
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:58,411
Speaker 1: when they see Barbara Gordon is her name She'll be like, oh wonder if that's the daughter of the Commissioner.

561
00:35:58,511 --> 00:35:59,596
Speaker 1: Oh, there's the Commissioner.

562
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,763
Speaker 1: He looks young Exactly.

563
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,390
Speaker 0: Um, I actually put what.

564
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:04,912
Speaker 0: did I give this?

565
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,840
Speaker 1: I gave this one a worth the time.

566
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:09,570
Speaker 0: I gave this a. oh I gave this bad.

567
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,051
Speaker 1: Really?

568
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:10,393
Speaker 0: Yeah.

569
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:11,637
Speaker 0: The reason I called it bad.

570
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:12,360
Speaker 1: I gave it man.

571
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:15,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, the reason I is bad is first of all some of the art.

572
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:17,223
Speaker 1: Oh it goes way off.

573
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:26,013
Speaker 1: model her face exactly when she meets her roommate and she's in the background like looking and Her face is like scrunched back and her hair's in a ponytail.

574
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,540
Speaker 1: I thought it was a different character.

575
00:36:27,821 --> 00:36:31,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean some of the art, you know, it was like at these really weird angles.

576
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,608
Speaker 0: That's what I wrote in my notes, right?

577
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:34,913
Speaker 0: And now that yeah, so look at here.

578
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:35,717
Speaker 0: Here's the example.

579
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:35,857
Speaker 0: right.

580
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:36,943
Speaker 0: you look at this Yeah, like.

581
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:38,672
Speaker 0: her foot is like all in her leg.

582
00:36:38,692 --> 00:36:39,817
Speaker 0: It's like what's going on there.

583
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:42,769
Speaker 0: is she Like let's don't go in that direction.

584
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,980
Speaker 1: and her face is different all over the place.

585
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:47,360
Speaker 1: Her eyes are big eyes are tiny nose is big noses.

586
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:52,222
Speaker 0: I guess if it was this is a 3d page and the leg was actually coming out of the page and was a little more Inwards.

587
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:53,146
Speaker 0: it might make sense.

588
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:56,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did not like the half Chun Li thighs.

589
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:05,079
Speaker 0: The other reason I didn't like it is that the plot was so superhero cookie cutter like oh There's a secret bad guy mask.

590
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:07,707
Speaker 0: I wonder who he is.

591
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,131
Speaker 0: I better fight them.

592
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:10,956
Speaker 0: Oh, no, so I got hurt.

593
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:12,400
Speaker 0: Let's see what happens.

594
00:37:12,662 --> 00:37:26,560
Speaker 1: I am pissed as well that the cops overreacted in the stereotypical way that cops overreact in all these stupid comics where you know The one cop is so mad at her that she wasn't able to save the one guy's life and pulls a gun on.

595
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,443
Speaker 0: That's the that was actually.

596
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:35,765
Speaker 0: the only interesting part of the whole book was that they show that she screws up not in terms of Vulnerability like Superman had physical vulnerability But the vulnerability.

597
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:42,110
Speaker 0: if she's trying to save the guy and the dude goes out the window and he's dead It's like oh you didn't actually save the dude.

598
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,700
Speaker 0: You're trying to save you failed at superheroing.

599
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:47,080
Speaker 0: That was that was the only good part of this whole thing.

600
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:50,664
Speaker 0: But yeah The reason it's not even gonna read it is Even if it was just lying.

601
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:55,520
Speaker 0: there is cuz like look the plot is so cookie cutter, you know, what's gonna happen, right?

602
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,773
Speaker 0: It's like you're gonna find out who the bad guy is ever so slowly.

603
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:00,300
Speaker 0: It's gonna be some kind of surprise.

604
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,119
Speaker 0: It's a character, you know, she's gonna fight them.

605
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:12,054
Speaker 1: Also the fact that the bad to read it to know what's gonna happen murdered The first person by taking a garden hose and putting it in his mouth.

606
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:13,680
Speaker 1: It was kind of yeah, okay.

607
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:24,364
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's like it almost reeked of trying to like use the old Batman stereotypes, but make him grim and dark Like oh look totally killed that dude All right.

608
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,098
Speaker 0: So let's move on bat wing.

609
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:31,674
Speaker 1: I Don't know why but I actually really liked bat wing.

610
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:33,240
Speaker 0: really I put this is bad.

611
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:40,539
Speaker 1: I put it as worth the time and I almost it's close to me wanting to buy a Trade just to see what the deal is really.

612
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:55,269
Speaker 1: I think it's partly because I love the scene where he's like people in Africa ain't afraid of a bat and Batman just like you've just got to sell it And how he's got like his own Analog of Alfred and how it's kind of like.

613
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,460
Speaker 1: let's take Batman and put it in Africa where a lot of Batman's tricks.

614
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:05,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, wouldn't work, you know, I don't want to start the whole, you know We could have whole episodes about racism in common and superhero comics, especially regardless of comic.

615
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:14,400
Speaker 1: Oh, it is Stereotypical Africa, right but but but Gotham City is so stereotypical grimey 70s, New York City.

616
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,620
Speaker 0: But I just want to say, you know, we can have all episodes about those two topics.

617
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:26,353
Speaker 0: But I just want to say that as a whole almost as a whole The you know, it clearly they're trying it reeks of effort.

618
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:28,900
Speaker 0: It's like they're trying not to be racist.

619
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,539
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's almost like token black guy on purpose comes across to me.

620
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:36,475
Speaker 0: So that's sort of like it's in my mind the whole time.

621
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:41,680
Speaker 0: I'm reading it like yeah They're trying to make a black Batman just so they can have black Batman to say they're not racist.

622
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,934
Speaker 1: Well, I guess here's I don't think that's the reason.

623
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:51,600
Speaker 1: I think that's just you To it being a white upper-middle-class dude probably so I'll put it this way what I liked about it.

624
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:52,892
Speaker 1: So maybe I can sell this to you.

625
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:56,730
Speaker 1: Is that Unlike Bruce Wayne millionaire playboy and all that BS.

626
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:58,335
Speaker 1: He's literally a cop.

627
00:39:58,697 --> 00:39:59,700
Speaker 0: That was that is cool.

628
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,957
Speaker 1: I like that part and I like how he's investigating both things.

629
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:06,992
Speaker 1: like the investigation side of Batman seems to be on the forefront.

630
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:21,765
Speaker 1: figure out what's going on in this kind of Realistic ish, you know modern crime thing as opposed to the kind of like the Joker killed someone Let's go stop him and then fail to kill him because Batman's a pussy Mm-hmm.

631
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:23,189
Speaker 0: I think you know, I didn't like about.

632
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:26,880
Speaker 1: you know that forced racism part, but I don't know if that's really there though.

633
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:41,993
Speaker 0: No, well, you can never say if it's really there cuz I did not feel that but that the majority of the book actually Right if you count the pages most of the pages is literally just I'm hitting you I'm Batwing up fight punch you guy with knife.

634
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:43,579
Speaker 0: No now I'll stab you.

635
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:46,857
Speaker 1: No, there were multiple scenes where he walks in on a pile of bodies.

636
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,666
Speaker 0: now Yeah, that was the end of the book.

637
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:51,598
Speaker 1: He walked in on the pilot now, but there's the other pile of bodies in the middle.

638
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, two piles of bodies, but I mean most of the book is really just him.

639
00:40:56,681 --> 00:41:00,340
Speaker 0: You know coming up on a guy hitting them coming up on guy hit him also, right?

640
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:01,865
Speaker 0: You know the art.

641
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:03,797
Speaker 0: definitely it has a different style, which is good.

642
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:08,200
Speaker 1: I don't like the art but it feels cook not cookie cutter.

643
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,395
Speaker 1: It feels like this sort of generic superhero art that started appearing in the 2000s.

644
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:15,300
Speaker 1: that I really I recognize.

645
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,960
Speaker 0: I think this art is actually a much different style than what's typical.

646
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:25,660
Speaker 1: It's very atypical but maybe not of Marvel DC superhero comics, but like this the independent superhero comics.

647
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,727
Speaker 1: I've seen it like the mocha.

648
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,540
Speaker 1: this really reminds me of that style.

649
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:37,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing I don't like is that even though it's different from the other books It's just not a style that I like and it has sort of this digital fakeness to it.

650
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:41,853
Speaker 0: Oh, yes That's the part that bothers almost like it's in an uncanny valley of like.

651
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:46,810
Speaker 0: you can tell the same way that you can tell When someone's was made with it, right exactly.

652
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I can tell you made this with the computer.

653
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:51,176
Speaker 0: It looks like the.

654
00:41:51,257 --> 00:41:59,432
Speaker 0: you know Somebody copied and pasted this character onto the background and like this sort of like this flat Distance between them like a color form almost.

655
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:01,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was really it was yeah.

656
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:02,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you said it best.

657
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:08,173
Speaker 0: it's hard to describe because I'm not an illustrator Yeah, but it's got a fake digital miss to the art.

658
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:12,400
Speaker 0: that made me not want to look at it Really, so I'm giving it a worth the time.

659
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm mad because I do want to know what's going on, but I'm not willing to put money toward finding out what's going on.

660
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put it as bad.

661
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,388
Speaker 0: Okay, it's it's it's a high bad.

662
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,878
Speaker 0: It could go into med territory just cuz I like that.

663
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:25,300
Speaker 0: He's a cop.

664
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:29,720
Speaker 1: I feel like if you didn't have this hang up on the perceived races.

665
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:33,252
Speaker 0: You know the racism and the sexism pretty much any book.

666
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:40,433
Speaker 0: it's it's problem right because on the one hand Noticing it in any blue any any book where there are non-white people in it.

667
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,580
Speaker 0: It's sort of like oh, there it is.

668
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:50,534
Speaker 1: Well Scott, I'll put it this way I think I have that for the sexism because every time any time is comics The first thought is oh my god, don't draw them all stupid.

669
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:51,980
Speaker 1: Oh my god, don't draw them all stupid.

670
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,186
Speaker 0: It's the same exact thing.

671
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:57,468
Speaker 0: anywhere you see boobs and anywhere you see non-white people It just sticks out.

672
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,976
Speaker 1: but I don't get the non-white people thing.

673
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,991
Speaker 0: I don't feel that Thing is in some books.

674
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:09,027
Speaker 0: I felt it and other books I didn't cuz I. so I think there is something that some of the books are doing that other ones are not know the boobs Some of them are just outright sexist.

675
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:23,872
Speaker 1: All right, so let's let's go Batman Detective Comics, so If anything is closest to my Batman aka Frank Miller Dark Knight Returns This one is in that Batman's actual past.

676
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:24,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is.

677
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:28,207
Speaker 0: this is way dark You know, it goes hardcore full-on.

678
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:32,560
Speaker 0: what Batman is, you know Joker's all crazy doing his crazy shit.

679
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:34,391
Speaker 1: I'm not the hero that Gotham wants.

680
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:35,900
Speaker 1: I'm the hero that guy needs.

681
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know Gotham City looks all you know art deco and stuff and you see that fucking train.

682
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:43,404
Speaker 0: Oh my god That was great, right?

683
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:46,816
Speaker 0: It's got the end where you know where the book is going.

684
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:51,257
Speaker 0: right at the end You know Joker basically gets his face replaced by somebody in.

685
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:54,920
Speaker 1: well We don't know if it was replaced or if he just doesn't have a face.

686
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:56,126
Speaker 0: No, he definitely cuz.

687
00:43:56,146 --> 00:43:58,759
Speaker 0: he says tonight we'll both sell but a rebirth, right?

688
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:01,240
Speaker 0: So he definitely has a new face.

689
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:04,929
Speaker 0: So Joker is out there But he looks like Nicholas Cage.

690
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,200
Speaker 1: and Nicolas Cage is out there and he looks like the Joker.

691
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:11,539
Speaker 0: So that's gonna be really interesting right to see in issues two and three, right?

692
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:17,640
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like, you know, hey, you know, you're gonna see maybe Commissioner Gordon or maybe what's that big fat cop?

693
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,666
Speaker 0: Well, who's always there?

694
00:44:18,928 --> 00:44:19,974
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot his name.

695
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:23,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know that, you know You're gonna be looking at them and thinking that could be the Joker.

696
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,205
Speaker 0: That's his new face.

697
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:27,149
Speaker 0: So now he looks like that.

698
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,020
Speaker 0: I just it's like if Joker was a skin spy.

699
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,006
Speaker 0: It's like he could be anybody Right, you know, maybe Robin.

700
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:34,994
Speaker 0: you see Robin there and like maybe Robin's a joker.

701
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:36,420
Speaker 0: It could be he got that.

702
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,902
Speaker 0: You got a joke.

703
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:37,545
Speaker 0: You're Robin face.

704
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:39,494
Speaker 1: I just I really like the art.

705
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:40,880
Speaker 1: I like the way Joe.

706
00:44:41,101 --> 00:44:46,279
Speaker 1: I like the scene where Joker's in Arkham and they're all standing around him like is he in there?

707
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:48,247
Speaker 1: I think he's bored.

708
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:49,938
Speaker 1: I hope he's going to sleep one.

709
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:52,843
Speaker 0: some things I got to say, you know The.

710
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:53,929
Speaker 0: the plot was very.

711
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:55,900
Speaker 0: it felt very much like a beat ass episode.

712
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,040
Speaker 0: It did only of course way darker way darker way more gory and such.

713
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:05,863
Speaker 0: Every time Joker talked I heard Course.

714
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:10,020
Speaker 0: but for Batman, I didn't really hear either of the Batman voices.

715
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:12,735
Speaker 0: I know neither the beat has one nor the.

716
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:13,640
Speaker 1: you know what boys I heard.

717
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:21,948
Speaker 1: I heard the same voice I hear in my head when I read Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, which is just a Badass that I can't describe in words.

718
00:45:21,988 --> 00:45:22,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't.

719
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,393
Speaker 0: I tried to.

720
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,259
Speaker 1: it's not this bad, right?

721
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:29,520
Speaker 0: I could hear that Batman or the beat ass Batman if I tried on purpose.

722
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:31,900
Speaker 0: But I only went trying on purpose and you know.

723
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,619
Speaker 0: But the Mark Hamill one was always there whether I tried or not.

724
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,811
Speaker 1: Well, because Mark Hamill is one of my favorite voice actors in his.

725
00:45:37,892 --> 00:45:45,930
Speaker 0: I also just want to say on that one page for the robot Oh, yeah, I couldn't think about anything except robust for Voltron Like robot robust.

726
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:47,036
Speaker 0: Also, I want a robot.

727
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:49,312
Speaker 1: I Want to buy the trade of this one.

728
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:55,279
Speaker 0: I Put it as man because I would read it if you bought it But I wouldn't pay if like if it was on the list.

729
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,250
Speaker 0: I wouldn't pay for if I rank.

730
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,140
Speaker 0: the best is better things to pay for.

731
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,588
Speaker 1: I like Batman is the story.

732
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:04,066
Speaker 1: if I have to rank all the Batman things There's like two continuities.

733
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:16,058
Speaker 1: one continuity ends with the Dark Knight Returns And this is the closest thing I've seen to something that would fit in my personal timeline before that because even Killing Joke, I didn't really like that much.

734
00:46:16,078 --> 00:46:21,171
Speaker 1: and The Dark Knight Returns whatever sequel I couldn't even finish that shit.

735
00:46:21,332 --> 00:46:26,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the other continuity of Batman's I've liked is Michael Keaton Batman.

736
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:27,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course and beat ass.

737
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:32,418
Speaker 1: So of all the Batman's this one is closest to one of the continuities.

738
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:36,765
Speaker 0: I like Okay, let's move on Green arrow.

739
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:40,497
Speaker 1: the green arrow is this is crap so bad.

740
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:42,710
Speaker 1: Oh my god His arrows are so derpy.

741
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,149
Speaker 1: Like I'm gonna shoot a flashbang Basically I'm gonna shoot an ice arrow.

742
00:46:46,189 --> 00:46:50,845
Speaker 0: So first of all, right green arrow is basically Iron Man who I hate.

743
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:52,651
Speaker 0: so I already hate it.

744
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,517
Speaker 1: Actually, I think it was Iron Man.

745
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:55,360
Speaker 1: I like Iron Man.

746
00:46:55,461 --> 00:46:56,188
Speaker 0: I hate Iron Man.

747
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:59,990
Speaker 0: I like how he's a prick Is the same as Iron Man?

748
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:02,379
Speaker 1: No, he's more of a jackass than a prick.

749
00:47:03,723 --> 00:47:08,920
Speaker 0: It's a rich dude who's got no powers except He's got a lot of money and he goes around trying to be a hero.

750
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,112
Speaker 1: Where does he keep all these arrows in his quiver?

751
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,240
Speaker 1: How many arrows fit in that quiver?

752
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,940
Speaker 1: How does he know to grab the ice arrow as opposed to the sonic arrow?

753
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,920
Speaker 1: They don't even bother fucking explaining that I just it's such superhero bullshit.

754
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:27,480
Speaker 1: But at least it didn't seem to rely on any other crap.

755
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:33,720
Speaker 1: So if you like this sort of superhero underwear pervert bullshit, you can just start with this and go with it and never look back.

756
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:36,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, so also right if you're into that sort of thing.

757
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, the art was sort of consistent, but it looks like an old comic which I kind of liked.

758
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:42,863
Speaker 0: actually I didn't like.

759
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:46,040
Speaker 1: I liked how it almost reminded me of some 90s x-men.

760
00:47:46,282 --> 00:47:53,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess like the penciling could be 90s But the way they colored it it sort of just looked like a bad 90s cartoon.

761
00:47:54,061 --> 00:47:57,960
Speaker 1: I guess I say that for someone who's a fan of superhero comics.

762
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:03,018
Speaker 1: I am fine with this green arrow because it does not appear to pull in any other DC bullshit.

763
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:07,720
Speaker 1: That's true That's true, but I personally have no patience for underwear pervert bullshit.

764
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:14,510
Speaker 0: So also a lot of the dialogue was pretty corny, but I feel like I'm sorry It's about time you got put in your place.

765
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:16,380
Speaker 1: That was definitely on purpose.

766
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,787
Speaker 0: Why don't y'all just sign up for a reality show.

767
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:20,580
Speaker 0: it'd be much easier to get the attention you want to be is obviously.

768
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,402
Speaker 0: Here are the notes.

769
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:23,689
Speaker 1: I wrote okay arrows are derpy.

770
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,374
Speaker 1: green arrow is derpy.

771
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,526
Speaker 1: The dialogue is campy WTF puns.

772
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:34,530
Speaker 0: I wrote Iron Man cheesy dialogue Ultra-lame and unsubtle inclusion of current social issues.

773
00:48:34,591 --> 00:48:35,132
Speaker 0: I forgot about.

774
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:35,834
Speaker 1: I forgot about.

775
00:48:36,155 --> 00:48:38,484
Speaker 1: I had something to say on that too But I had a note.

776
00:48:38,704 --> 00:48:41,738
Speaker 0: the art is dated and looks like a ten-year-old web guy.

777
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,664
Speaker 1: Yeah But it's fine.

778
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,071
Speaker 1: I can't you know to do an objective review.

779
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:50,060
Speaker 1: This is great if you like campy superhero stuff.

780
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,248
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm not gonna recommend you read this other one.

781
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:56,260
Speaker 0: No, I put in bad but worse than bad.

782
00:48:57,004 --> 00:48:58,051
Speaker 1: Hawk and Dove what?

783
00:48:58,091 --> 00:48:59,520
Speaker 0: so let me talk about Hawk and Dove.

784
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:01,819
Speaker 0: I pick up Hawk and Dove and I look at it and I'm like, huh?

785
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,327
Speaker 0: This sort of looks really 90s.

786
00:49:04,468 --> 00:49:06,034
Speaker 1: dove reminds me so much.

787
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:07,800
Speaker 1: I read the tick sidekick.

788
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:15,693
Speaker 0: I read a page and then I turn the page and I saw some pouches and I was like This really does look really 90s and I'm like, huh?

789
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:19,220
Speaker 0: Let me go turn back to Rob life, but I was like.

790
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:21,085
Speaker 0: No, it was.

791
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:23,013
Speaker 0: it is Rob Liefeld.

792
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,740
Speaker 0: It's like a self parody.

793
00:49:25,102 --> 00:49:29,689
Speaker 0: Look at the way Hawk Hawk looks on the fucking cover With his chat.

794
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,623
Speaker 0: Oh, it's it Rob Liefeld at his best I mean.

795
00:49:33,085 --> 00:49:40,964
Speaker 0: for everything I've heard he's a good guy at conventions But he's still doing his bad feet and pouches and everything else He's known for.

796
00:49:41,005 --> 00:49:43,500
Speaker 1: why doesn't he put pouches on the feet so we don't have to see him?

797
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:44,222
Speaker 0: I don't know.

798
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:47,193
Speaker 0: but yeah the art is typical.

799
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:49,320
Speaker 0: awful Rob Liefeld not as bad.

800
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,645
Speaker 0: It's not Rob Liefeld's worst, but it's still Rob Liefeld, which makes it bad in general From our taste.

801
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's what I wrote.

802
00:49:57,919 --> 00:49:58,020
Speaker 1: one.

803
00:49:58,722 --> 00:50:00,707
Speaker 1: Each character gets a power listing of.

804
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:06,459
Speaker 1: here are all their powers and the fact that one of the powers was and I quote healing factor.

805
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:08,658
Speaker 1: Do we that's?

806
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,427
Speaker 1: Comic book bullshit.

807
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't give me that.

808
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:17,340
Speaker 0: Also, it was so just I don't know there was absolutely nothing interesting about the plot.

809
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,612
Speaker 0: It was pretty much like I'm a superhero.

810
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:21,160
Speaker 0: I'm stuck with his other superhero.

811
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:21,863
Speaker 0: We're a pair.

812
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:25,580
Speaker 0: the the guy who used to be the other superhero died and this new one showed up.

813
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,725
Speaker 0: And I don't he was my brother.

814
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:29,780
Speaker 1: I feel vague homoerotic tension there that I can't quite explain.

815
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:33,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's almost like Wonder Twins hate each other.

816
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:35,980
Speaker 0: kind of yeah or Wonder Twins tension.

817
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,569
Speaker 1: And you know it didn't start with the origin story.

818
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:41,380
Speaker 1: it flashed back to it immediately, and it was really dumb.

819
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:43,267
Speaker 1: I wish I had power here you go.

820
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:45,375
Speaker 0: Well that was exciting.

821
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:46,600
Speaker 1: Yeah great alright.

822
00:50:47,022 --> 00:50:51,720
Speaker 1: Also, you know also, what's with this whole dead man thing this other character?

823
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:54,817
Speaker 0: That was kind of their dead man's in a few of the other books.

824
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,864
Speaker 0: I know I know I.

825
00:50:56,924 --> 00:50:57,947
Speaker 1: that's what I'm saying.

826
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,574
Speaker 1: Don't I don't want the crossover crab.

827
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:01,136
Speaker 0: It's weird.

828
00:51:01,156 --> 00:51:02,760
Speaker 0: It's like is dead man that popular?

829
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:04,232
Speaker 0: He's in a bunch of the book.

830
00:51:04,272 --> 00:51:05,039
Speaker 1: I'd never heard of him.

831
00:51:06,808 --> 00:51:11,205
Speaker 0: He was actually there was the dead man comic in Wednesday comics.

832
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:16,314
Speaker 0: no okay alright That was the first time ever heard of dead man, but he's it.

833
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:28,006
Speaker 1: dead man's in like four But at least bugs while it's intermingling these comics Which I don't like because that's what got me out of comics when I first started reading them when someone was like oh No, you got to read This is a number one.

834
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:28,508
Speaker 0: Yes.

835
00:51:28,528 --> 00:51:36,360
Speaker 1: You don't have to know anything else to understand this but going forward You're gonna have to read all the other ones with dead man probably because he was just an offhand mention.

836
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:37,845
Speaker 1: He's a big deal.

837
00:51:37,865 --> 00:51:42,000
Speaker 0: He matters in this in this comic at least yeah, but the thing is even though he matters.

838
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:43,065
Speaker 0: What's the plot?

839
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:43,849
Speaker 0: I mean the plot.

840
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,825
Speaker 0: it was almost if this was a parody of Underwear perfect comics.

841
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:50,074
Speaker 0: it would have been great because that's sort of what it was.

842
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:50,415
Speaker 0: it was like.

843
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:53,245
Speaker 0: it was so Stereotypical you it could have all.

844
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:58,486
Speaker 0: it was going into the realm of making fun of itself or other books like itself But it wasn't.

845
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:00,620
Speaker 0: I think it's actually trying to be a superhero comic.

846
00:52:01,182 --> 00:52:03,049
Speaker 0: I I'm not a parody of superhero.

847
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,258
Speaker 1: I have nothing good to say about Hawken Dove.

848
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:05,700
Speaker 0: none good.

849
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,274
Speaker 0: Oh, I just want to point out one thing though at this point is what I noticed.

850
00:52:09,595 --> 00:52:14,220
Speaker 0: if you look on page one look at See these little things that are like telling you the place in time.

851
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:16,363
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Those are the that.

852
00:52:16,484 --> 00:52:23,606
Speaker 0: that graphic design of the of the horizontal bar with these slight slant on the right with that font in the middle Was the same in every book.

853
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:27,600
Speaker 0: if you look at there look at look at Justice League number zero.

854
00:52:27,701 --> 00:52:29,639
Speaker 0: Look, there's that same kind of bar.

855
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:30,924
Speaker 1: You're right, right.

856
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:43,653
Speaker 0: every book had that same graphic design for the parts where it told you You know five years ago or Washington DC or three days ago in New York Was always the same graphic design for those little narrative things.

857
00:52:44,014 --> 00:52:50,120
Speaker 0: in all 52 of the books They've got this uniform graphic design going on on the internals not just on the cover design.

858
00:52:50,722 --> 00:52:51,826
Speaker 0: I don't know that's good or bad.

859
00:52:51,846 --> 00:52:52,588
Speaker 0: I just noticed it.

860
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:53,050
Speaker 0: Well.

861
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,033
Speaker 0: That's all I had to say about it.

862
00:52:54,535 --> 00:52:59,681
Speaker 1: So bad bad Justice League International.

863
00:53:00,163 --> 00:53:01,790
Speaker 1: who the fuck is booster gold?

864
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:02,493
Speaker 1: I what is?

865
00:53:02,573 --> 00:53:02,915
Speaker 0: I know.

866
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:08,952
Speaker 1: I know who booster gold is Because I gotta say I don't know anything about booster gold at all.

867
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:10,576
Speaker 1: I literally do not time travel.

868
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:15,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, so reading this I Inferred that maybe he's from the future.

869
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,287
Speaker 0: The deal is is he was like a teenager.

870
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:20,895
Speaker 0: like I said I read booster gold like I have.

871
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:26,878
Speaker 0: I had a big black-and-white Booster gold showcase that had all like the first issues of booster gold never had the whole thing.

872
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:34,980
Speaker 0: And basically from what I remember which is probably slightly off because I tried to put it out of my mind He was like a teenager.

873
00:53:35,403 --> 00:53:42,598
Speaker 0: He got sent to the past or the future Where he's got some superheroes stuff, and then he went back to another.

874
00:53:42,618 --> 00:53:44,446
Speaker 0: all right No, he was in the future.

875
00:53:44,466 --> 00:53:57,463
Speaker 0: He went to like the hall of I think the maybe The legion of superheroes, and he got some superhero stuff, and then he went back in time with it something along those lines Whatever.

876
00:53:57,523 --> 00:54:00,738
Speaker 1: Here's my only complaint about this other than everything.

877
00:54:00,758 --> 00:54:04,573
Speaker 1: yep Batman looks that's not Batman.

878
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:06,120
Speaker 1: what if there's a guy who looks like Batman?

879
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:08,713
Speaker 0: It's almost like Adam West Batman or super.

880
00:54:08,753 --> 00:54:09,899
Speaker 0: It's I know it's super friends.

881
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,481
Speaker 0: bad It is.

882
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:16,860
Speaker 1: there's this other guy who looks like Batman is pretending to be a crab ass version of Batman flying the plane.

883
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, and basically this book is basically super friends.

884
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,000
Speaker 0: the book right it's pretty crap.

885
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:28,020
Speaker 1: It's nothing but a series of one-liners while they fight generic lava monsters.

886
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, the art.

887
00:54:29,271 --> 00:54:31,585
Speaker 0: I mean the coloring is okay But the rest of it is meh.

888
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:40,197
Speaker 0: the thing that really bothers me is that this follows a plotline That it was in maybe 10 of the books and I'll mention it every time the plotline comes up.

889
00:54:40,237 --> 00:54:46,297
Speaker 0: It's pretty much Government organization gets together a whole bunch of superheroes to fight some unspecified threat.

890
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:46,940
Speaker 0: That's coming up.

891
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:54,421
Speaker 0: It's like how many different government organizations are out there forming together groups of superheroes like 20.

892
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:57,391
Speaker 0: Oh, how many threats to the world can there be at the same time?

893
00:54:57,652 --> 00:54:59,820
Speaker 1: seriously the subplot of you know?

894
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,409
Speaker 1: People are mad about this and are burning down.

895
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,975
Speaker 1: the Hall of Justice didn't okay?

896
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:05,079
Speaker 0: explain me this.

897
00:55:05,562 --> 00:55:09,000
Speaker 0: Justice League number one was five years ago, correct?

898
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,580
Speaker 1: So maybe they were destroyed on the interim hold on face was five years ago.

899
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:22,360
Speaker 0: Meanwhile the Hall of Justice that was apparently built less than five years ago Right because the Justice League didn't even exist five years ago

900
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,062
Speaker 1: Yeah is

901
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:28,338
Speaker 0: already abandoned and some sort of public park that people can enjoy and

902
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:28,900
Speaker 1: simultaneously

903
00:55:29,482 --> 00:55:32,776
Speaker 0: Only lasted five years in the Hall of Justice lasted less than they might

904
00:55:32,817 --> 00:55:33,500
Speaker 1: be in space.

905
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:36,820
Speaker 0: Well, I'm pretty sure the Justice League is in space.

906
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,403
Speaker 0: But they went to.

907
00:55:37,423 --> 00:55:38,147
Speaker 0: they already gave out.

908
00:55:38,187 --> 00:55:40,820
Speaker 0: they built the Hall of Justice and gave up on it in the span of five years.

909
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:42,746
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me really?

910
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:45,415
Speaker 0: but really you know what that was quick.

911
00:55:45,736 --> 00:55:46,980
Speaker 1: all I got to say is this one's bad.

912
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,906
Speaker 1: We're already issue ones.

913
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:53,160
Speaker 1: There's too much entanglement that I can't keep it all straight in my head.

914
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is that you do sort it.

915
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,480
Speaker 0: to get the fullness of this book you do sort of need to know stuff.

916
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,720
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of characters in here that it's like who the fuck are they?

917
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:02,939
Speaker 0: It's like I don't you know.

918
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,201
Speaker 0: If you don't know who all the different Green Lanterns are or like, you know Who's?

919
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:06,824
Speaker 0: oh.

920
00:56:06,925 --> 00:56:10,100
Speaker 0: and the thing is even if you do pretend these characters are brand new.

921
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,340
Speaker 1: Well, Green Lantern doesn't even exist until week two as far as I'm concerned, right?

922
00:56:14,661 --> 00:56:14,982
Speaker 0: It's like.

923
00:56:15,384 --> 00:56:17,995
Speaker 0: you don't even know like and who do you even care about these people?

924
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:19,140
Speaker 0: Do I care about Tora?

925
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,607
Speaker 0: Olives daughter ice from Norway?

926
00:56:21,627 --> 00:56:24,216
Speaker 1: are those real superheroes are made up for this?

927
00:56:24,276 --> 00:56:27,568
Speaker 1: and the other thing is like All of these characters got to.

928
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:29,915
Speaker 1: all those characters exist otherwise like today.

929
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:31,240
Speaker 1: were they in other comics or are they new?

930
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,304
Speaker 0: I don't I'm sure.

931
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:34,056
Speaker 0: some of the plastic man is definitely not new.

932
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:34,680
Speaker 1: Okay?

933
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,786
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which ones you're doing.

934
00:56:36,806 --> 00:56:38,291
Speaker 0: was apparently they all only a booster.

935
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,580
Speaker 0: gold is not new that Green Lanterns not new.

936
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:48,440
Speaker 1: The only power pretty sure Is to say a non-witty one-liner that is so stereotypical like Russian.

937
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,368
Speaker 0: They're all punch-out jokes.

938
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:55,980
Speaker 0: Justice League International is nothing but punch-out stereotypes of nationalities.

939
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:56,903
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

940
00:56:57,425 --> 00:56:59,653
Speaker 0: And even though they're all stereotypes.

941
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:01,720
Speaker 0: They don't really have personalities, right?

942
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,723
Speaker 0: It's all they.

943
00:57:02,883 --> 00:57:07,417
Speaker 0: all the people ever say is like, you know, hey help us help me fight the thing.

944
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:09,565
Speaker 0: do this attack Dude, it's like none of the carrot.

945
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:13,300
Speaker 0: It's not you know, I'm looking for characters that have personalities, right?

946
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:19,890
Speaker 0: I mean the way you can tell if A character has a real personality is if you can make jokes about them For example ponies.

947
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:20,819
Speaker 0: not to bring it up again.

948
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:26,183
Speaker 0: You can make jokes about every pony like you can do a Rainbow Dash impersonation like I'm rainbow Like.

949
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:28,159
Speaker 0: what would Rainbow Dash do in situation X?

950
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:32,680
Speaker 0: Right, you can answer that question because Rainbow Dash is a real personality.

951
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:35,491
Speaker 1: So I thought you were going to say a real person.

952
00:57:35,692 --> 00:57:40,467
Speaker 0: no, but none of these characters Have any personality.

953
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:41,009
Speaker 0: what to them?

954
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:41,431
Speaker 0: They're just.

955
00:57:41,511 --> 00:57:42,395
Speaker 0: they're just all they.

956
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:49,818
Speaker 0: all they are is Each character in this book is just a costume and a nationality.

957
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:50,500
Speaker 0: That's all they are.

958
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,607
Speaker 0: They have nothing else to them.

959
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:53,820
Speaker 1: in the school of three of them have personalities.

960
00:57:54,181 --> 00:57:56,907
Speaker 1: Booster gold doesn't give a shit.

961
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:59,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, and isn't Batman and Russian guy.

962
00:57:59,534 --> 00:58:04,990
Speaker 1: That man is derpy Batman and Now the Russian guy doesn't have any personality either.

963
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:09,771
Speaker 1: the third person I was gonna say is the Green Lantern is surly Oh kind of yeah, but it's like they have no soul to them.

964
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,000
Speaker 0: They're just costumes with nationalities attached to them.

965
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:15,327
Speaker 0: This book is pretty bad bad.

966
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:17,254
Speaker 0: Justice League international do not want.

967
00:58:17,575 --> 00:58:19,865
Speaker 0: if you gave me all the trades for free I would give them away.

968
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:21,859
Speaker 1: so men of war people.

969
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,928
Speaker 1: I hated the next one men of war which on the surface as far as I can tell is supposed to be just like Old-school comic style war stories.

970
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:33,200
Speaker 1: Yeah one set in like a future with superhero crap.

971
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:35,838
Speaker 0: Well, one of them is sergeant rock and the other one is something else.

972
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:43,065
Speaker 1: Is it just me or was this really boring and filled with fanboy jargon and a whole bunch of like mini Shirot asms.

973
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:43,789
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

974
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:45,497
Speaker 0: I actually put this in the met category.

975
00:58:45,537 --> 00:58:46,060
Speaker 0: I kind of like this.

976
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,223
Speaker 1: I put it in man, but I it's close to bad because It's.

977
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:58,413
Speaker 1: it tries so hard to appeal to the American equivalent of the military fanboy By using all this jargon and all these acronyms and there's little bubbles everywhere.

978
00:58:58,453 --> 00:58:58,815
Speaker 1: being like.

979
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:04,859
Speaker 1: that stands for the whatever Recoilist rifle stands for you know zone of engagement all this kind of idea.

980
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:09,080
Speaker 0: I did notice that you feel like you're learning military stuff, but really you're not.

981
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:11,349
Speaker 0: No, I mean what I liked about it.

982
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,767
Speaker 0: first of all, it was a 399 book if you didn't notice I did not know.

983
00:59:14,787 --> 00:59:18,306
Speaker 0: it was more expensive and you got more pages Which is why I had the second story in it.

984
00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:21,337
Speaker 0: the art in the second story was stunning.

985
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,610
Speaker 0: I just got to say that Oh my god, I love the art in the second story the second story.

986
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:26,660
Speaker 1: I liked way more than the first story, right?

987
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:33,576
Speaker 0: It seems like first of all, it's like there's a generic war always going on.

988
00:59:33,877 --> 00:59:34,900
Speaker 0: It's like what war is this?

989
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like this is just a war that's always happening.

990
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:41,000
Speaker 0: And also it seems like this whole world is that it's like they just wars everywhere.

991
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:42,866
Speaker 0: It's like it's the war planet.

992
00:59:43,207 --> 00:59:47,720
Speaker 0: this what this particular book men at war concentrates an actual full-on wars.

993
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:54,429
Speaker 0: But it seems like this war is going on in every other book whenever some government needs to get a group of seer heroes to Fight an evil organization.

994
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,840
Speaker 0: It's wars everywhere.

995
00:59:56,021 --> 01:00:00,160
Speaker 1: I guess what bothered me about the first story in this book is that it was such like cliche.

996
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:03,891
Speaker 1: Check out our gritty realistic military story.

997
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:08,324
Speaker 0: I thought it was a typical sergeant rock story and I tend to like Sergeant rock stories.

998
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:16,960
Speaker 0: cuz sergeant rock is all about that military guy who will go against the military He's like, I don't want your promotions, you know fight, but it was just so cliche.

999
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,053
Speaker 0: It was like Oh Shama as opposed to without Moroi.

1000
01:00:20,073 --> 01:00:21,540
Speaker 0: Nah, that's what it was.

1001
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,839
Speaker 0: That's what sergeant rock is all about.

1002
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:32,320
Speaker 0: the other thing I did the other thing that boosted it a little bit that first story was that it mixed the The war story with the superhero story, right?

1003
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:37,800
Speaker 0: It put him together true and you know that it really only ever happens in like Captain America and stuff like that.

1004
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:44,560
Speaker 0: So, you know to be like well look his regular old soldiers in a world where there's a fucking flying dude who smashes shit.

1005
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:54,758
Speaker 1: It's like oh, I guess Military had been a little less storm ship Starship Troopers movie and a little more realistic and the characters were a little.

1006
01:00:54,778 --> 01:00:59,440
Speaker 1: I mean They're a little too cliche and too archetypical for my taste.

1007
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:01,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I read the second story.

1008
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:03,355
Speaker 0: just the art was was so good.

1009
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:04,158
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

1010
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:04,800
Speaker 1: It was okay.

1011
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,745
Speaker 1: I wouldn't call it great.

1012
01:01:05,785 --> 01:01:06,609
Speaker 0: That's my kind of arts.

1013
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,675
Speaker 0: I really like that style.

1014
01:01:07,816 --> 01:01:08,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like it.

1015
01:01:08,338 --> 01:01:10,808
Speaker 1: Okay That's why it's on the low end of math.

1016
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:13,940
Speaker 0: I've got a high man rims got a low man on the men-of-war.

1017
01:01:14,701 --> 01:01:16,087
Speaker 1: Alright, let's talk about Oh Mac.

1018
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:16,789
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

1019
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,115
Speaker 1: What the fuck was that?

1020
01:01:18,135 --> 01:01:19,420
Speaker 0: Oh Mac is definitely.

1021
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:32,660
Speaker 1: I have no idea what's going on or what happened or who these people are or I. Just I've almost nothing to say about it other than that WX and the gobbles and all the proper nouns were hilarious.

1022
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:34,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is bad.

1023
01:01:35,148 --> 01:01:36,693
Speaker 1: so bad what I wrote.

1024
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:37,135
Speaker 1: I wrote.

1025
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:41,770
Speaker 1: here's a note like reboot But WTF like reboot, huh?

1026
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,312
Speaker 0: That's what you think.

1027
01:01:42,352 --> 01:01:43,356
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

1028
01:01:43,396 --> 01:01:44,580
Speaker 1: That's the closest thing.

1029
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:49,420
Speaker 1: I was even remotely reminded of mmm, even though it's nothing like reboot.

1030
01:01:49,888 --> 01:01:50,459
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

1031
01:01:50,862 --> 01:01:54,480
Speaker 1: And I just I have no idea what the hell it is and I have no interest in reading.

1032
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:02,896
Speaker 0: So first of all, the art was so like Jack Kirby Throw up, you know, it was sort of like homage to Jack Kirby, but it wasn't a good one.

1033
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:06,950
Speaker 0: It was just like Okay, you're really making it look like Jack Kirby on purpose.

1034
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:08,596
Speaker 0: Maybe Jack Kirby invented this character.

1035
01:02:08,636 --> 01:02:10,583
Speaker 0: That's why I'm guessing I have no idea.

1036
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:15,820
Speaker 0: It's probably it's likely Oh, how come Oh max an acronym - yeah, there were a lot of acronyms.

1037
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,440
Speaker 0: I want to say that now every book had tons of acronyms.

1038
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:24,460
Speaker 0: There were like five different evil organizations that were acronyms five different good organizations that were acronyms.

1039
01:02:24,964 --> 01:02:26,919
Speaker 0: You know, it's like how many good and bad?

1040
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,485
Speaker 0: Organizations can there be with acronym names?

1041
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,593
Speaker 0: different technologies and weapon systems and heroes.

1042
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:35,160
Speaker 0: all these acronym names just all over the place.

1043
01:02:35,261 --> 01:02:36,871
Speaker 0: It's like Marvel does the same thing too.

1044
01:02:36,911 --> 01:02:43,874
Speaker 0: It's like stop it Not everything's a fucking acronym name and it's like and it always has to be clever too, right?

1045
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:46,020
Speaker 0: It can't ever be just talker shade.

1046
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,325
Speaker 0: Yes, dog urge God.

1047
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:49,108
Speaker 0: There's so many of them.

1048
01:02:49,128 --> 01:02:50,773
Speaker 0: We'll get as we go through.

1049
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:52,780
Speaker 0: I'll bring up ones that we've already missed some.

1050
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:59,420
Speaker 0: The thing I hated most about Oh Mac I just don't want to give it so much time is that it was it had.

1051
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,647
Speaker 0: Perhaps it was in a lot of books.

1052
01:03:01,707 --> 01:03:02,811
Speaker 0: But this one most of all.

1053
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:06,300
Speaker 0: I think I hit you you little guy syndrome Oh my god.

1054
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:13,173
Speaker 0: and that every panel there's someone doing something and Saying what they're doing it that you see them doing in the panel.

1055
01:03:13,514 --> 01:03:17,306
Speaker 0: and most of the panels are action of a guy doing something.

1056
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:24,309
Speaker 0: but unlike Nightwing or at least the action was like almost all of all Mac's dialogue was like I am Oh Mac back away.

1057
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:32,559
Speaker 0: Get out of my way or I will hit you you little guy I will hit you and it like and oh, it's like, you know, what you need is a woman's touch.

1058
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:34,990
Speaker 0: I must always remind everybody.

1059
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:42,237
Speaker 1: Oh my god, not just another pretty face That I also noted that exact panel as yeah good.

1060
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:43,743
Speaker 0: God Good.

1061
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:46,692
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just uh, and they did.

1062
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:51,267
Speaker 0: the bad guys were just generic evil science Organization, but he was Lord.

1063
01:03:51,368 --> 01:03:52,111
Speaker 1: What's his name?

1064
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:52,573
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1065
01:03:52,613 --> 01:03:53,155
Speaker 1: I don't care.

1066
01:03:53,175 --> 01:03:54,360
Speaker 0: I will not be denied.

1067
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,764
Speaker 0: I smash you you little guy.

1068
01:03:55,904 --> 01:03:59,555
Speaker 1: Oh Mac bad stay in hidden temple comic bad.

1069
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:01,179
Speaker 0: Wish Oh Mac would smash it.

1070
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:03,164
Speaker 0: So sorry, I'm done with that.

1071
01:04:03,304 --> 01:04:04,428
Speaker 0: So and the cliffhanger at the?

1072
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:10,572
Speaker 0: Oh another thing on invention is a lot of the books tried Obviously to end in a cliffhanger.

1073
01:04:10,612 --> 01:04:18,714
Speaker 0: if it's book number one Obviously you want to end in a cliffhanger to make the guy by number book book number two This one didn't end in a cliffhanger it I think it was just.

1074
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,160
Speaker 0: it did sort of end in a cliffhanger.

1075
01:04:20,302 --> 01:04:22,040
Speaker 0: It was just a really stupid one.

1076
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,714
Speaker 0: It's like they were trying to make a cliffhanger by being like brother.

1077
01:04:26,035 --> 01:04:27,300
Speaker 0: I is a space station.

1078
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:31,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like they're trying to make that a cliffhanger.

1079
01:04:31,593 --> 01:04:35,002
Speaker 1: It's like wow that would have worked on me in 1990.

1080
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:36,426
Speaker 0: yeah that it was ill.

1081
01:04:36,887 --> 01:04:37,208
Speaker 0: it's weird.

1082
01:04:37,228 --> 01:04:39,675
Speaker 0: like some books tried most of the books tried to do it.

1083
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:47,600
Speaker 0: a few succeeded and Only some of the ones that succeeded actually had me caring like even some of the ones that had a real cliffhanger.

1084
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,045
Speaker 0: I still didn't care.

1085
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:52,920
Speaker 1: Yep, like Batgirl didn't really care Animal Man is the only cliffhanger I cared about.

1086
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:57,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, other than maybe Detective Comics because I really want to know what Joker's plot.

1087
01:04:57,253 --> 01:04:59,640
Speaker 0: that didn't make me care about the cliffhanger.

1088
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:05,698
Speaker 0: It just made me excited for the possibilities of who is Joker gonna masquerade as what's you know?

1089
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:13,600
Speaker 1: No, so Just to go back to that one Joker's a reaction to the way that all went and everything was really well written.

1090
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:19,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, if very creepy and disturbing, okay, so Static shock.

1091
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,580
Speaker 1: All right static shock bad for it's a good thing.

1092
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,733
Speaker 1: I had my deflector what you might call it up or else those.

1093
01:05:25,913 --> 01:05:27,580
Speaker 0: Oh god, that's the exact same shit.

1094
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:28,162
Speaker 0: I'm complaining.

1095
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:33,420
Speaker 1: this whole comic is nothing but is nothing but that I'll use the samoflange on the bath madad.

1096
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:35,006
Speaker 1: Oh, no, the bath and I didn't work.

01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:38,398
Speaker 1: I gotta use the boof my fucker fuck right comic.

1098
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:42,066
Speaker 0: also Queensborough bridge has pedestrians.

1099
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:42,527
Speaker 0: Yes.

1100
01:05:42,568 --> 01:05:43,330
Speaker 0: Do your research?

1101
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,839
Speaker 0: I can see the fucking bridge out my window looking at it.

1102
01:05:45,899 --> 01:05:49,373
Speaker 0: right now I'm looking at the real bridge not even like a picture of it.

1103
01:05:49,433 --> 01:05:50,940
Speaker 1: There is the bridge like the.

1104
01:05:52,123 --> 01:05:53,811
Speaker 0: It looks nothing like the bridge in the comic.

1105
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:58,774
Speaker 0: and he they even said there are no Pedestrians this fucking pedestrians on the goddamn bridge.

1106
01:05:58,815 --> 01:05:59,257
Speaker 0: I see them.

1107
01:05:59,438 --> 01:05:59,860
Speaker 0: I am them.

1108
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,853
Speaker 1: I bike over that bridge on a regular basis.

1109
01:06:02,155 --> 01:06:02,920
Speaker 0: do your fucking research.

1110
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:06,590
Speaker 0: What the fuck like everything about this comic?

1111
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:07,754
Speaker 1: It could have been cool.

1112
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:08,837
Speaker 1: I like the main character.

1113
01:06:08,877 --> 01:06:09,600
Speaker 1: He's snarky.

1114
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:10,685
Speaker 1: He's kind of like a.

1115
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:12,393
Speaker 0: I think it was it.

1116
01:06:12,513 --> 01:06:14,884
Speaker 0: I think he was forced snark though I think it was also.

1117
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:20,270
Speaker 0: I had that same a little half as much as I had in the White guy guilt.

1118
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:23,819
Speaker 1: Yeah white guy, whatever You've got a weird like complex.

1119
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,569
Speaker 0: Also, the dude is basically like it's.

1120
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,355
Speaker 0: it's almost like they always draw him.

1121
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:38,308
Speaker 0: whenever they draw him They're looking at the Green Goblin in a spider-man book Right because he's standing and crouching on this flying disc Octagon hex thing.

1122
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:39,153
Speaker 1: He's so cool.

1123
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:40,037
Speaker 0: He's like Zack Morris.

1124
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:40,419
Speaker 0: It's like here.

1125
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:46,219
Speaker 0: It's like every pose that he ever has is stolen from spider-man Green Goblin in some spider-man comic.

1126
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,879
Speaker 1: But oh also electrocuted does not mean that.

1127
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,884
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just the half.

1128
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:53,626
Speaker 0: the comic is.

1129
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:59,520
Speaker 0: he's fighting a guy and just made up made up words about electricity that don't match real physics.

1130
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:02,560
Speaker 0: Oh, I must beat his made-up word with my made-up word.

1131
01:07:02,681 --> 01:07:03,606
Speaker 0: I beat your and it's like.

1132
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,853
Speaker 0: it's the same as I like.

1133
01:07:04,873 --> 01:07:06,240
Speaker 1: Tron level is over 9,000.

1134
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,806
Speaker 0: It's the same as I hate you little guy.

1135
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:09,151
Speaker 0: I'm casting this spell.

1136
01:07:09,272 --> 01:07:11,199
Speaker 0: I'm casting this spell now on you.

1137
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:18,360
Speaker 1: Oh good guy, never mind that he everything he does also has some sort of positive slash negative electricity pun, right?

1138
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:28,200
Speaker 0: I mean last of all you get the family drama, which is kind of okay ish, but it's ham-fisted but Dude can fucking fly on a disc.

1139
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,390
Speaker 0: Why is he asking for a goddamn driver's license?

1140
01:07:31,033 --> 01:07:32,259
Speaker 1: because he wants to be a normal?

1141
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:36,134
Speaker 1: no No, he doesn't though because his motivation is clearly I want to be a goddamn superhero.

1142
01:07:36,154 --> 01:07:36,836
Speaker 1: This is fucking awesome.

1143
01:07:36,856 --> 01:07:37,800
Speaker 0: Let's go, right?

1144
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,980
Speaker 0: It didn't makes no sense.

1145
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:47,380
Speaker 0: It's like they tried to give in the normal teen life But they completely ignored the fact of how the teen life would be modified by the superhero life.

1146
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,920
Speaker 0: It's like they just has the two separate lives and they're not intermingling.

1147
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:52,146
Speaker 0: You know except for the.

1148
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:55,502
Speaker 0: I need to get away from my family to do my superhero wing without them knowing Part.

1149
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:57,206
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm on the racism part.

1150
01:07:57,527 --> 01:08:01,377
Speaker 1: while I do not feel your weird white guy guilt at least the misplaced part of it.

1151
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,775
Speaker 1: I Do find it somewhat?

1152
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,809
Speaker 1: Unnerving to me that oh, yeah.

1153
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:11,179
Speaker 1: I told them all you're some inner city whatever so they'd stay away from you.

01:08:11,943 --> 01:08:12,466

1157
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,939

Speaker 1: I wrote see Superman number one in quotes because it does that shit.

1165
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:49,733
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll talk about that when we get to Superman number one.

1166
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:50,697
Speaker 0: Just forget that for now.

1167
01:08:51,078 --> 01:08:51,560
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1168
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like cuz did you read Superman number one?

1169
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:54,560
Speaker 0: I think I just gave it to you.

1170
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,349
Speaker 1: No, I didn't read it yet.

1171
01:08:55,733 --> 01:09:02,716
Speaker 1: All I know is There's too many comics referencing each other in this kind of way like oh, that's not true.

1172
01:09:02,858 --> 01:09:05,169
Speaker 0: Jad ready I'm gonna go off on that shit.

1173
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:07,883
Speaker 0: when we talk about Superman number ocean I'm ready for.

1174
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:13,240
Speaker 1: the other thing I wrote was and I quote what the fuck did I just read at a whole bunch of exclamation?

1175
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,479
Speaker 1: Points in question marks, right?

1176
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,064
Speaker 1: So I could not tell you what happened.

1177
01:09:16,305 --> 01:09:17,850
Speaker 1: a bunch of like underwear.

1178
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:20,979
Speaker 1: perverts screamed at each other and random shit happened.

1179
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:21,705
Speaker 1: And then it ended.

1180
01:09:21,805 --> 01:09:23,620
Speaker 1: and I don't know what's going on a bunch of underwear.

1181
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:31,095
Speaker 0: Someone's trying to get a bunch of underwear perverts together to form a team I think to fight some guys if you don't know who these heroes are already.

1182
01:09:31,135 --> 01:09:35,149
Speaker 0: It doesn't make a lot of sense If you do it, you know, they don't introduce them.

1183
01:09:35,169 --> 01:09:38,019
Speaker 0: There's something going on with a mountain and a horn.

1184
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:40,826
Speaker 0: None of the characters of any personalities.

1185
01:09:40,866 --> 01:09:46,787
Speaker 1: They're just costumes with night hours around between a bunch of basically Unrelated scenes.

1186
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:48,439
Speaker 1: the angles are all weird.

1187
01:09:49,304 --> 01:09:52,720
Speaker 0: It literally the art was not to my liking whatsoever.

1188
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:53,724
Speaker 0: I read it's.

1189
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:56,194
Speaker 0: the only thing is while I was not liking the art.

1190
01:09:56,294 --> 01:10:05,320
Speaker 0: Sometimes it was least Interesting like there's that page where the the woman is like interesting facial expression No, but at the same time her face is kind of distorted and weird.

1191
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,249
Speaker 1: I like the plot the vague plot idea I get of.

1192
01:10:08,831 --> 01:10:14,000
Speaker 1: yeah, the moon is threatening the earth somehow Yeah, but basically here's my notes ready.

1193
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:20,460
Speaker 0: There was a mention of slash fiction and it was like they were trying to be hip and cool by mentioning slash fiction.

1194
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:24,929
Speaker 1: Oh, they did that again in Superboy, they're like just totally not a Mary Sue.

1195
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:27,840
Speaker 0: art is sometimes interesting which I already talked about.

1196
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, how many things can threaten the entire world simultaneously?

1197
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,000
Speaker 0: How many hero teams can save it simultaneously even if it just in this one?

1198
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,079
Speaker 1: The fuck is going on.

1199
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:41,072
Speaker 1: I read every single word in every single panel twice because I try.

1200
01:10:41,092 --> 01:10:43,460
Speaker 1: I could not tell you what the plot is other than that.

1201
01:10:43,801 --> 01:10:47,660
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell the moon is trying to fucking kill everybody.

1202
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:53,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the reason that this book is tied in with Superman is to give Nerds a reason to reason.

1203
01:10:53,788 --> 01:10:55,960
Speaker 0: right because if it was just on its own no one would give a fuck.

1204
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,079
Speaker 1: I was waiting for bad news like show up.

1205
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:05,240
Speaker 0: Someone who really cares about Superman number one might be forced to read storm watch by tying them together because they're pretty much you know whatever.

1206
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:12,880
Speaker 1: so The last comic from week one was Swamp Thing, which oh, by the way, if it wasn't obvious storm watch is bad.

1207
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:14,465
Speaker 0: No kidding real bad.

1208
01:11:14,485 --> 01:11:18,560
Speaker 1: I like Swamp Thing, but I put it man cuz I don't really care where it goes.

1209
01:11:19,102 --> 01:11:21,312
Speaker 0: I also put it as a high man.

1210
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,197
Speaker 1: It is a high man.

1211
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:22,820
Speaker 1: I like fire.

1212
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:28,020
Speaker 0: I like this book, but I also don't care where it goes and I don't care about Swamp Thing.

1213
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:37,030
Speaker 0: Also a lot of the enjoyment I got from the book was because I had read Alan Moore's Swamp Thing so I still have to read which I knew.

1214
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:45,380
Speaker 0: so I know a lot about Swamp Thing and So I got a lot of stuff out of this that I definitely would not have gotten had I not read that.

1215
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:51,434
Speaker 0: Also the art in the swamp thing is sometimes stunning sometimes not right.

1216
01:11:51,454 --> 01:11:57,420
Speaker 0: so and like this first page of the birds falling And the Superman oh my god the whole comic is like that right bye.

1217
01:11:57,681 --> 01:12:02,000
Speaker 0: But the whole comic doesn't look like that over here when Superman is talking to the construction worker.

1218
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,187
Speaker 0: It just looks like a normal comic but over.

1219
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:08,000
Speaker 1: so it's like did you notice the Tyrannosaurus Rex about to kill Batman?

1220
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1221
01:12:10,508 --> 01:12:11,414
Speaker 1: How come it has skin?

1222
01:12:11,534 --> 01:12:12,440
Speaker 1: where did that come from?

1223
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,679
Speaker 1: I want to see the comic about the dinosaur that tries to kill Batman.

1224
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:18,032
Speaker 0: well That's the dinosaur that's next to the penny in the Batcave.

1225
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,479
Speaker 1: I know but I guess it came to life.

1226
01:12:20,022 --> 01:12:21,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can read those comics.

1227
01:12:21,911 --> 01:12:23,096
Speaker 0: I could go find out what they are.

1228
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:23,940
Speaker 0: I forget which ones they are.

1229
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:28,200
Speaker 0: I think it's like Batman and the Outsiders or something like that Swamp Thing.

1230
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:34,919
Speaker 1: I would have had a much higher opinion of this if it did not have Superman and Batman and all this bullshit in it.

1231
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,808
Speaker 0: Well, you know having read the Alan Moore Swamp Thing.

1232
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:45,580
Speaker 0: that didn't bother me because the way Swamp Thing integrates with the world Even Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns has another superhero or two in it.

1233
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,971
Speaker 0: But I recognize that as a negative quality.

1234
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:56,220
Speaker 0: if the Swamp Thing is truly number one You shouldn't get you shouldn't have to read the Alan Moore Swamp Thing to get the maximum enjoyment out of this one.

1235
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,947
Speaker 1: I mean look at if I hadn't read it.

1236
01:12:58,028 --> 01:13:01,283
Speaker 0: I might have put this in the low mat or even bad Like.

1237
01:13:01,363 --> 01:13:04,960
Speaker 1: maybe I pushed it into the low man like like we talked about the killing joke.

1238
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,620
Speaker 1: You might get an additional like oh if you knew about it, but if you don't know about it, it still works.

1239
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:14,156
Speaker 1: It's not detracting but here but you're it's you're.

1240
01:13:14,196 --> 01:13:15,060
Speaker 0: it's not detracting.

1241
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:20,740
Speaker 0: You can get this book without having know anything about Swamp Thing, but it's a significant benefit, right?

1242
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,543
Speaker 0: You know what analogy.

1243
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:26,320
Speaker 0: that benefit was enough to boost it from low man, maybe even bad to sky man.

1244
01:13:26,504 --> 01:13:34,380
Speaker 1: Though Imagine think about the difference between watching Galaxy Express 3 and I in the movie having or having not seen the TV show exactly.

1245
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,725
Speaker 1: It's the same kind of thing there.

1246
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:39,879
Speaker 1: You have to see both or you're really missing out on the real reason to watch it.

1247
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:46,131
Speaker 0: Yep also, I Just want to point out what about right here dinosaur the action.

1248
01:13:46,152 --> 01:13:48,560
Speaker 0: remember I talked about how I like the action comic Superman.

1249
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:53,195
Speaker 0: So here was my first opportunity to see Superman since that action come.

1250
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:54,860
Speaker 1: why does he deliver a line?

1251
01:13:55,121 --> 01:13:57,086
Speaker 1: So cliched that even penny arcades made.

1252
01:13:57,106 --> 01:14:02,400
Speaker 0: well, and they're a hard-timed man to find mister doctor, right, but he's flying.

1253
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:03,419
Speaker 0: It's like oh god damn it.

1254
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:09,160
Speaker 0: Well, he can fly by that point but the thing is he's also appears much older than he does in action comic.

1255
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:10,809
Speaker 0: So is that action comics?

1256
01:14:11,232 --> 01:14:12,740
Speaker 0: it didn't I couldn't find anywhere.

1257
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:17,380
Speaker 0: I didn't look that hard in action comics where it said ten years ago, whatever, you know.

1258
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:28,980
Speaker 0: But it seems like maybe that action comics is truly in another universe or in the past You know, but it has to be after Justice League before it doesn't make sense really.

1259
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:30,846
Speaker 0: But I don't like the Superman.

1260
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,074
Speaker 0: that's in this swamp thing, but I you know, I like.

1261
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:34,920
Speaker 1: I only like to Superman.

1262
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:42,853
Speaker 1: I like the Superman that we talked about at the way beginning in this episode Justice League and I like Superman in Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns.

1263
01:14:43,033 --> 01:14:43,274
Speaker 1: Yep.

1264
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:44,379
Speaker 1: Those are the only two.

1265
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:45,083
Speaker 1: Superman I like.

1266
01:14:45,224 --> 01:14:47,440
Speaker 0: I like the Lois and Clark TV show Superman.

1267
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:50,994
Speaker 0: I watched that show the way I watch ponies now that I was a kid.

1268
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:52,400
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't hold up.

1269
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:55,980
Speaker 1: I was gonna say have you seen it in the last decade when I was a kid?

1270
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,653
Speaker 0: I watched that thing every day every and whenever there's a new episode.

1271
01:14:59,734 --> 01:15:01,139
Speaker 0: I'd be waiting for that shit to come on.

1272
01:15:02,402 --> 01:15:08,345
Speaker 1: My brother - I think I was falling asleep as I was reading Swamp Thing because my nose Oh, we got to mess for Swamp Thing.

1273
01:15:08,365 --> 01:15:11,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz my notes go you're a hard man to find mister.

1274
01:15:12,057 --> 01:15:12,780
Speaker 1: and then a scribble.

1275
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:22,718
Speaker 1: I wrote the word pecs maybe decks and then I wrote Superman that the man kind of fades off into a scribble and then it looks like drool.

1276
01:15:24,422 --> 01:15:27,157
Speaker 0: So so we'll come back with another episode on the week.

1277
01:15:27,217 --> 01:15:27,720
Speaker 0: two books.

1278
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:30,793
Speaker 0: I guess it takes about a week per episode here.
