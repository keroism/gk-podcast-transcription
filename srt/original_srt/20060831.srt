1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:18,450
Speaker 0: It's Thursday August 31st, and this is geek nights tonight the geek fable of the bamboo and the vision.

2
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,262
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

3
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,360
Speaker 1: So in an occurrence that has repeated yet again.

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,250
Speaker 1: This is the third time this has happened in recent recent memory.

5
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:33,550
Speaker 1: I won a board game But by a single point with Alex being right there behind me.

6
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:37,490
Speaker 1: And if anything in the game had gone at all differently Alex would have won.

7
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:40,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anything had gone slightly differently I could have won.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,463
Speaker 0: I wasn't too far back.

9
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:46,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, not in the most recent game We played but in uh the Amon Ray game.

10
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:48,375
Speaker 0: Oh the Amon Ray game I don't know what happened.

11
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:51,910
Speaker 0: like I felt like I was doing better than any Amon Ray had ever done.

12
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,093
Speaker 0: And I did.

13
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:57,645
Speaker 0: I did two stupid things which basically just threw away four points that were free.

14
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:03,669
Speaker 0: I just threw them away and And Even with those four points it wouldn't have made me win.

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:16,546
Speaker 1: so I just noticed that I find it interesting that when you beat me you beat me by a lot and when I beat you I beat you by a lot, but Alex tends to lose by like one point or win by like one point.

16
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what's up with that.

17
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:18,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know either.

18
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,324
Speaker 0: Oh Anyway, oh, I gotta remember to say this cuz I'm gonna forget.

19
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:23,605
Speaker 0: Yes.

20
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:24,670
Speaker 1: It is quite the meta bit.

21
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:34,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have applied for membership to the forum and you have not received an email that says Congratulations.

22
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:40,430
Speaker 0: You are now a member of the forum It might be because you're using hotmail, which is the suck.

23
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:48,630
Speaker 1: Yes Because the fact is we have never denied anyone membership because no one has presented themselves with that stupid of a facade.

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,581
Speaker 0: Yes, and we've only banned one person ever.

25
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,749
Speaker 1: So yeah and goddamn was that kid annoying.

26
00:01:53,849 --> 00:02:06,029
Speaker 0: So If you have applied for membership to the forum chances are your membership has been approved Within maybe an hour or so, but you know, we're guaranteed it'll be approved within like a day.

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:19,048
Speaker 1: Yes Because while we haven't been posting to our own forum as much as we used to because we've been incredibly busy The forums have been rocking a lot and we do watch them to make sure that new members get taken care of and the mr Perry does his job.

28
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:21,530
Speaker 1: Yep, so done it so much lately.

29
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:32,489
Speaker 0: If you apply to the forums go back to the forums in like a few hours or the next day and you'll be all set You know, even if you don't get an email saying so and two nice bits about the forums.

30
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:41,230
Speaker 1: one I'd like to say oh, you know, we hit like a milestone in number of hits But we had a hundred thousand hits like a long time ago, and I just gave up on even looking at that.

31
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:50,030
Speaker 1: Yeah whatever and If you google image search or Just google search for a lot of random things our forum comes up number one or two.

32
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,549
Speaker 0: I think the reason for that is that any forum is number one a place that is full of links.

33
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:08,268
Speaker 0: and Number two, you know people link to various discussions in our forum because we make them public and a lot of people's forums out there They don't let you read the forum without signing in so that gives our forum a distinct advantage.

34
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:19,476
Speaker 0: also The the lusimo vanilla nature of our forum, you know is You know, it's coded very nicely HTML wise which Google also enjoys.

35
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:28,302
Speaker 1: the other thing I've noticed is that our page rank is soaring because a lot of Websites that have a lot of clout and have linked to our forums multiple times.

36
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:29,968
Speaker 0: Oh one more thing.

37
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:37,210
Speaker 0: Is that mr Period because he enforces good grammar and all that good stuff that helps the forums out a lot also on Google.

38
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:42,709
Speaker 0: You know a forum that's full of loot wheat bear loot we loot we loot we.

39
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:44,659
Speaker 0: It's a new thing.

40
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:51,726
Speaker 0: I just invented no loot We're OMG is not gonna be so high on the googles as something that's like hello.

41
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:52,468
Speaker 0: How are you doing?

42
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:54,088
Speaker 0: Hi, I'm fine Thank you, blah blah blah.

43
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:01,486
Speaker 1: So then I guess another warning to all of our new listeners who have joined the forums While he hasn't been active for the last three or four days too much.

44
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,763
Speaker 1: Mr Period is there and he has full authority to edit your posts.

45
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:15,490
Speaker 1: if you post with bad grammar and spelling now I don't mean like if you spell one word wrong occasionally or if you just happen to make a typo.

46
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,934
Speaker 1: He doesn't even bother with that.

47
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:24,940
Speaker 1: if you make the same mistake more than once in the same post or if you make a grievous error Yes, it has to be pretty bad.

48
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,146
Speaker 1: You have to be killing Jedi.

49
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,723
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

50
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:29,048
Speaker 0: Yeah.

51
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,688
Speaker 1: But anyway, we've got a little bit of news.

52
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:38,170
Speaker 1: today It's Thursday, which is usually either the silly day or the tired day or whatever the silly tired day something like that.

53
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:39,969
Speaker 1: We'll go a little light on the news.

54
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:46,570
Speaker 1: I know we've been light on the news a lot lately, but there hasn't been a lot of non real-world news lately.

55
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,076
Speaker 1: I mean there's a lot of important news.

56
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:58,069
Speaker 1: if we wanted to talk about news we could talk for hours and hours every day About what's going on in Iraq what's going on in Mexico right now with that almost coup, but that wouldn't be fun.

57
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:11,363
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would basically be me Sounding really really pissed off about world politics Scott sounding really really pissed off about various other things Mostly world politics and mostly indifferent about the stuff that rim is pissed off about.

58
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:13,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, but other things entirely.

59
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:18,174
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, like you'd be like this sucks because of that and I'm like, no, I don't care about that I only care it.

60
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:20,344
Speaker 0: it sucks because of this and I'd be like what.

61
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:21,209
Speaker 1: but that doesn't even.

62
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,589
Speaker 1: Yeah our political discussions.

63
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,290
Speaker 1: We should do a couple shows on politics.

64
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:32,713
Speaker 1: I don't think that's the greatest idea, but I think our political leanings are fairly well known to our listeners at least I hope so.

65
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:34,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious.

66
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually it really isn't.

67
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:41,686
Speaker 0: No, it's not Yeah, because I mean it so doesn't fit in with anything normal.

68
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:42,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no label.

69
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,468
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people would say oh, they're just liberals, but I am so far from a liberal.

70
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:47,990
Speaker 0: I'm a wig.

71
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:57,872
Speaker 0: I know I know I forgot what they stood for but that the point is is that my Like.

72
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:06,030
Speaker 0: if you took all of my political stances and tried to arrange them into a party It would be a very old party that no longer exists a current one.

73
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:13,399
Speaker 1: The only two parties I've ever identified with though a couple of recent parties are starting to get my interest are The bull moose party.

74
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:16,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm serious First party was great.

75
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:22,430
Speaker 1: This party was great and the anti-federalist party, which was actually pro federalist, but don't get me started on that.

76
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,756
Speaker 1: Anyway now talking about that today.

77
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:29,990
Speaker 1: We got stupid useless completely not in any way relevant news.

78
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:30,653
Speaker 0: Awesome.

79
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,730
Speaker 1: All right now, I don't know if this is a rumor or what?

80
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:43,490
Speaker 1: I don't really trust the press this came out of but it was on slash shot and no one really said hey This is a rumor So I'm gonna run with it as though it's true.

81
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,801
Speaker 1: but I will say now that there are many grains of salt in what I'm about to say.

82
00:06:48,804 --> 00:07:00,947
Speaker 1: it appears it is possible that Microsoft is intending for Windows Vista to have a Startup sound that is not able to be turned off and not able to be modified.

83
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:05,641
Speaker 0: Whoa Well, first of all, that's not possible because someone can modify it.

84
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:14,627
Speaker 1: It's not what if it's in some sort of Encrypted protected part of the image install and it has checksums and it just won't boot.

85
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,433
Speaker 1: if the checksums are wrong Then it's not.

86
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:20,169
Speaker 0: it's not any more difficult to break that than it is to break any other DRM.

87
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:24,706
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but remember this won't hurt people who are smart or people who pirate.

88
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:27,877
Speaker 1: it'll hurt corporations and normal people.

89
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:37,490
Speaker 1: because I remember before I became an IT guy and When my knowledge of computers was basically user knowledge when I was learning like I would figure out how word processors work.

90
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:54,610
Speaker 1: You know the early days One of the first things I figured out how to do and one of the first things that most non tech people do when they you know get a new Windows computer is They moved the icons around and they modify their desktop and they change the desktop theme and they change all the sounds Windows makes.

91
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:56,231
Speaker 0: Yep, that's what you do like.

92
00:07:56,251 --> 00:08:02,265
Speaker 1: the first thing I would always do when I got a new Windows install when I was young was make some sort of Monty Python sound my opening sound.

93
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:14,032
Speaker 1: Yep, and Microsoft taking that away doesn't affect me because I don't care But that's going to affect all the people who are the way I was when I was 11.

94
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:24,541
Speaker 0: All I got to say is that over time what's happened is with Macintosh operating system and the Windows operating system I mean you have a computer that can do X things.

95
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:29,138
Speaker 0: X is a very large number if it's a general-purpose Computer with a lot of peripherals.

96
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,267
Speaker 0: It has a very large range of capabilities.

97
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:37,690
Speaker 1: You could make an argument that it has effectively infinite possible capability infinite digital capabilities.

98
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,342
Speaker 0: Of course, it is limited by speed at which it can perform those activities.

99
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:45,089
Speaker 1: However, we have currently not yet hit any reasonable speed barrier.

100
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:51,983
Speaker 0: Yes but the point is is that the Windows and Macintosh operating systems seem to be

101
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:52,886
Speaker 1: all about

102
00:08:53,308 --> 00:09:04,262
Speaker 0: you know Allowing you to very easily do a few things that your computer is capable of doing and making it Impossible for you to do other things that your computer is capable of doing or

103
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:05,626
Speaker 1: making it very difficult

104
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:22,821
Speaker 0: or making it very difficult while Linux and I guess BSD but mostly Linux and Linux distributions are all about Letting you do as many of the things your computer can do as is possible And that is why the Mac pissed us off in so many words.

105
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:25,630
Speaker 0: So this is just yet another example of that phenomena.

106
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, though again the Mac didn't totally piss us off.

107
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:31,250
Speaker 1: not totally actually as we've used it more and more.

108
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:35,690
Speaker 1: It is pretty much the perfect solution for us in the living room except for except for emulating.

109
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,694
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're working on that.

110
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:40,829
Speaker 0: We pretty much sacrificed emulating in favor of having less shit under the TV.

111
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:46,172
Speaker 0: Yes less noise in the living room and also the just I guess an even trade Well one.

112
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:49,686
Speaker 1: once we get a receiver with some optical input, I think we're gonna be all set here.

113
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:57,650
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway, I Someone on slash dot says something along these lines and I'll paraphrase because I was thinking the same thing.

114
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,230
Speaker 1: But they made but they made up some terms that seem useful.

115
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:11,410
Speaker 1: they said that this is basically a problem between a Product centric view versus a user centric view or a brand centric versus a user centric to Microsoft.

116
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:12,537
Speaker 1: This is great.

117
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,189
Speaker 1: It provides a uniform thing.

118
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,440
Speaker 1: every Windows computer makes this noise.

119
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,265
Speaker 1: this noise joins the psycho scape of Windows, you know, you hear this sound and you think that's the sound of a computer starting.

120
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious.

121
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:32,400
Speaker 0: That's the reason that they want this to be because you know, but the thing is that provides absolutely no benefit to the user at all.

122
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:38,388
Speaker 1: No, they're trying to market it as though it does that in fact Supposedly what kind of benefit does that have?

123
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,159
Speaker 0: Supposedly itself turned on a Windows computer from the article.

124
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:51,330
Speaker 1: the article that may or may not be true about all this basically said that The Microsoft guy said that one of the reasons for this and they gave a whole bunch of reasons.

125
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,620
Speaker 1: I didn't even read all of them.

126
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,990
Speaker 0: Whoa, I couldn't even think of one.

127
00:10:54,432 --> 00:11:00,019
Speaker 1: Alright, one of them that I found silly was that now when people boot up a computer They don't have to sit there and watch it.

128
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,989
Speaker 1: They'll just hear the sound and know it started.

129
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:08,130
Speaker 1: I don't have anything more to say about this other than if it is true.

130
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:14,647
Speaker 1: I know that it's not going to actually affect Windows adoption except possibly in corporate situations.

131
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,601
Speaker 0: I Mean, yeah, there are a lot of corporate situation.

132
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:20,983
Speaker 0: Well, first of all in a corporate situation You usually don't have speakers know you do.

133
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:23,636
Speaker 1: now You don't work in IT.

134
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:27,130
Speaker 1: pretty much every computer that is put in a corporate environment.

135
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:37,730
Speaker 1: Now because of the way the computers are made by Dell and all those companies They have perfectly serviceable speakers built in to the computers themselves in the micro ATX case.

136
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,693
Speaker 0: Oh, it's no good.

137
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:41,242
Speaker 1: My computer at work has speakers in it.

138
00:11:41,463 --> 00:11:43,330
Speaker 1: And when I first got to work it made noise.

139
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,638
Speaker 1: That's not good and I didn't realize where the speakers were.

140
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:48,990
Speaker 1: then I realized that PC speakers now are real speakers.

141
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,054
Speaker 0: That's not good.

142
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:53,650
Speaker 0: But yeah, so that that's a bad thing a very bad thing.

143
00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:00,969
Speaker 0: But anyway now you don't want to walk around an office or people are trying to work and you know rebooting computers Just keep making noises all over the place.

144
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:03,443
Speaker 1: But you shouldn't need to reboot your can.

145
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:04,390
Speaker 1: Oh, it's Windows.

146
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:16,957
Speaker 1: Now I hate to make a joke like that because Windows doesn't need to be rebooted that often anymore Unless you're ready to be rebooted less often than old Windows except more often than Linux and Mac Except when I worked at IBM.

147
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:27,968
Speaker 1: you realize how many of our enterprise level, you know Windows critical servers had Daily reboots or weekly reboot scheduled because that was the only way to keep them running.

148
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,174
Speaker 0: Wow Yeah, awesome.

149
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:31,117
Speaker 1: And these weren't all.

150
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,082
Speaker 1: these were like Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 awesome.

151
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,064
Speaker 1: one of them I built.

152
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,518
Speaker 0: You built it poorly if it need a reboot.

153
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,847
Speaker 1: no, no my build had nothing to do with those reboots.

154
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:47,827
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay, I could tell you what had to do with those reboots, but that's a story for a Monday.

155
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:50,075
Speaker 0: All right So I got some news.

156
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:57,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, the news is this Defective by design org which are those people who are fighting DRM, you know the people who?

157
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,259
Speaker 0: Wear the hazmat suits outside of the Apple stores.

158
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,230
Speaker 1: those people we didn't get to see because Scott couldn't find the Apple store.

159
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:08,730
Speaker 0: Someone told me it was near the Empire State Building which is not true not true at all.

160
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,705
Speaker 1: It's true in the sense that everything in Manhattan is near the Empire State Building.

161
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:13,929
Speaker 1: relative to I don't know.

162
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:16,890
Speaker 0: It was true that it was on the same avenue.

163
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:30,622
Speaker 0: But anyway October 3rd, they have declared is the day Against DRM and they start out with this interesting quote.

164
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,130
Speaker 0: and I'm gonna read this quote because it's that good you ready?

165
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:34,938
Speaker 0: Here's the quote.

166
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:42,335
Speaker 0: if Consumers even know there's a DRM what it is and how it works We've already failed.

167
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:46,770
Speaker 0: that quote is from a Disney executive that is unnamed Wow.

168
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:54,155
Speaker 0: so according to defective by design the way to defeat DRM is Making people aware of it.

169
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:59,607
Speaker 0: if we make it so that people know that there's a DRM what it is and how it works Then we win.

170
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:07,744
Speaker 0: So on October 3rd They're gonna do everything they can to make sure they get the word out about DRM.

171
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:09,810
Speaker 0: and there's a little is a cool website here.

172
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:29,570
Speaker 0: well, there's a cool part on their website where they're listing things that you can do and there's having I. they're posting idea submissions of What should be done on October 3rd to get the word out about DRM and some of these are pretty hilarious.

173
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,409
Speaker 1: I think we should just go to her Best Buy and have some fun.

174
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,148
Speaker 0: That sounds like a good idea.

175
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,930
Speaker 0: Here's what get arrested for violating your own copyright.

176
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,016
Speaker 0: Create a Yahoo question.

177
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,101
Speaker 0: create an anti DRM video.

178
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:46,310
Speaker 0: sell sandwiches with strings attached at lunchtime.

179
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:54,430
Speaker 0: Put posters up but have the posters be protected by DRM.

180
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,929
Speaker 0: Get the guy who does Dilbert to write a strip about DRM.

181
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,435
Speaker 0: All kinds of ideas here.

182
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:05,003
Speaker 0: So well, I know her third is gonna be.

183
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:06,869
Speaker 1: I know we're gonna do October 3rd.

184
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,894
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a fun day.

185
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:10,204
Speaker 1: We're gonna do a podcast about DRM.

186
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:11,449
Speaker 0: It's on October 3rd.

Speaker 1: We've got to make up.

191
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:26,296
Speaker 0: All right, it's a Tuesday But if we do the episode Monday night, then it'll be out Tuesday, which I say is good enough good enough And that's a tech day good enough.

192
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:29,390
Speaker 0: So Monday October 2nd DRM podcast.

193
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,390

Speaker 0: I got this cool thing.

196
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,906

00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:57,547
Speaker 1: All right real.

199
00:15:57,568 --> 00:16:05,750
Speaker 1: briefly There's a town in Vermont that has a problem with punk kids hanging out naked because apparently are they underage?

200
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:07,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just punk kids.

201
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:09,627
Speaker 0: Well, then isn't there some kind of low?

202
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:15,106
Speaker 1: No The thing is Vermont has no state law banning nudity at all.

203
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:16,430
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's cool.

204
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:26,624
Speaker 1: so unless an individual town is specifically banned it which many haven't because they never even thought to a Whole bunch of kids found this out and they're all hanging out in the middle of town naked.

205
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:31,047
Speaker 1: and there's this rash of Just punk kids hanging out naked all over the place.

206
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:31,510
Speaker 0: All right.

207
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,266
Speaker 0: Well, if it's not freezing cold out then you know for that problem is solved.

208
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:37,290
Speaker 0: problem, too.

209
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:38,334
Speaker 0: Is it like God?

210
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:40,603
Speaker 0: is it like coed, you know hanging out?

211
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:45,624
Speaker 0: Probably then, you know Wouldn't you get some little erection action?

212
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,690
Speaker 0: go nothing wrong with that?

213
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,804
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, I think you're not allowed to have an erection in public.

214
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:50,085
Speaker 0: That's cuz.

215
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,130
Speaker 1: you're not allowed to be naked.

216
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,280
Speaker 1: It depends on where you live and what the laws.

217
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,602
Speaker 0: All right.

218
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:53,983
Speaker 0: All right.

219
00:16:54,024 --> 00:17:00,287
Speaker 0: So it's a problem number three It's legal for little kids underage kids to be out in public naked.

220
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:04,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's legal for me to take pictures anywhere in public.

221
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:09,232
Speaker 1: If you want to make that example, you probably shouldn't have said me Okay.

222
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:10,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I wouldn't.

223
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,329
Speaker 0: but the point is you know what it create.

224
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:21,390
Speaker 1: The thing is the police basically said there are laws against like obscenity in these towns and the state and there are laws against you lewd and lavicious behavior.

225
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,316
Speaker 1: so as Long as they weren't doing anything sexual.

226
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,259
Speaker 1: It's perfectly legal.

227
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:34,169
Speaker 1: and I think though I a na l You could probably take pictures of anyone in a public place doing anything.

228
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:37,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't know.

229
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:41,150
Speaker 0: I just see a whole lot of contradictions, but it's cool hanging out naked school.

230
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:57,130
Speaker 1: I gotta say if I were a punk kid and And when I was living in sterling heights and I found out that was perfectly legal to be naked in public You can bet your ass that me and half of my friends in high school would be wandering around naked Doing the thing from that thing.

231
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,978
Speaker 1: That would have been a thing of the day if I was doing geek nights when we found it and it's going to be my Thing of the day next week.

232
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,209
Speaker 1: Scott knows what I'm talking about.

233
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,601
Speaker 0: I would totally do that if it wasn't illegal.

234
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,670
Speaker 1: All right, I got a thing of the day.

235
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:12,009
Speaker 1: I'm gonna save it for next Thursday.

236
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,542
Speaker 1: I'll give a hint every day for the next week.

237
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:17,750
Speaker 0: if anyone can guess you'll remember to give a hint.

238
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:18,688
Speaker 1: We'll see if I do.

239
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:26,656
Speaker 1: Okay If anyone remembers or if anyone figures out what it is or if you remember to make it you're thinking that reminds me to do A hint because I forgot to after a day.

240
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,689
Speaker 1: You'll win some sort of non monetary non-physical prize.

241
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,530
Speaker 0: awesome anyway.

242
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:38,229
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is a flash game called dark.

243
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:41,329
Speaker 1: But is this some sort of goth game?

244
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,234
Speaker 1: No, it shows a wrist and you have to slice it a little bit just enough to look cool But not enough to kill you.

245
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:51,150
Speaker 0: It's the flash game of medieval surgery.

246
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,745
Speaker 1: Wait, so cutting off boils and applying leeches.

247
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,793
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly Awesome.

248
00:18:57,014 --> 00:19:01,530
Speaker 0: I mean this is sort of it's like a really cheap really quick trauma center.

249
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,062
Speaker 0: That's got four levels in it as if three or four levels.

250
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:05,644
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

251
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:07,190
Speaker 1: Well wasn't level three of vampire.

252
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:18,770
Speaker 0: Yes, level one is remove an arrow from the soldiers leg level two is cut off some plague boils and Level three is kill a vampire.

253
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,338
Speaker 0: If there was a level four, I forgot it.

254
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:27,690
Speaker 0: Maybe there isn't one and after you beat all the levels They give you a score based on how quickly you beat it.

255
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:38,830
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like a quick and easy trauma center where you have to use the keyboard and the mouse combined to try to Beat the game really quickly and at first it's a little tricky because you got to figure out exactly what to do.

256
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:43,350
Speaker 0: But after you do it all once it's like oh I see and just go whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh and beat the game.

257
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:50,410
Speaker 0: But it is a lot of fun to do horrible medieval surgeries on poorly drawn flash animations.

258
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:54,346
Speaker 1: But of course the moment you've all been waiting for.

259
00:19:54,366 --> 00:20:04,054
Speaker 1: now We are going to relay to you one of the greatest geek fables of our era the story of the vision and The bamboo.

260
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,330
Speaker 1: now there are actually three fables rolled together into one.

261
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:18,949
Speaker 1: I like to call this day the day of destiny for This is one of the periods of 24 hours in my life Wherein I got more stories in that time than from many other periods in my life.

262
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,557
Speaker 0: Okay, first we have to set up the background.

263
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:21,978
Speaker 0: you ready?

264
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,485
Speaker 0: It's summer at our IT.

265
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:30,082
Speaker 0: I I'm in I'm working for a company.

266
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,636
Speaker 0: do it on co-op I believe and Is not there.

267
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,509
Speaker 1: I'm living in downstate, New York.

268
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:44,990
Speaker 0: I am living alone in colony working all every weekday and not doing anything else at night or on the weekend Except for hanging out with people who are still in Rochester.

269
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:51,852
Speaker 0: One of the people I was hanging out with was my good friend Ian who I met in Israel in the summer of 2000.

270
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:58,741
Speaker 1: Yep, Ian like he's not really so much a member of the front row crew because we don't see him a lot But he is definitely an ally to the front row crew.

271
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:00,690
Speaker 0: He's mad cool, dude, and he has his own crew.

272
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:11,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what we were doing mostly was playing a lot of Mario Party Mario Party 5 to be specific because that was the Mario Party that was available.

273
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:15,142
Speaker 1: Now you have to understand that when Scott says they were playing Mario Party.

274
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:16,807
Speaker 1: They were not playing Mario Party.

275
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:21,506
Speaker 0: They were playing Mario Party, we were seriously playing some Mario Party.

276
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:33,830
Speaker 0: There was another guy Frugal and he there was his apartment that we were playing most of the Mario Party in and there were a couple other guys I forget their names and you know, they were their friends that were also playing Mario Party and it was all cool.

277
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,295
Speaker 0: Everyone's hanging out having a good time.

278
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:36,258
Speaker 0: Mario Party now.

279
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,324
Speaker 0: We had a Mario Party shtick.

280
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:56,550
Speaker 0: shtick number one Right was that we they had purchased, you know, the the professional wrestling toy belts and they had the tag team one and a couple other ones and Depending on what kind of Mario Party game you had just played whoever won would get the belts.

281
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:02,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they had various, you know world championships that would come and go and they were a big deal.

282
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:05,870
Speaker 1: everyone got really Really into it having those belt.

283
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:11,410
Speaker 1: I mean if you were playing for the championship the belts would be sitting there on top of the TV through the whole game.

284
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:15,670
Speaker 0: Okay shtick number two Frugal who I just mentioned it was his apartment.

285
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:25,989
Speaker 0: He had a little Wario toy With like this little and he had like a necklace with Wario on it with a big Wario toy hanging and he would put it on to play Mario Party and he would be.

286
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,607
Speaker 0: Wario was his character and he would like rub the Wario and stuff and he was pretty good at Mario Party.

287
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:39,233
Speaker 1: now this started growing Among all of us in our gaming and for a while each one of us had a unique totem that we would bring whenever we played A significant game.

288
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:43,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, I made my little booze at a perler beads because I was always boo.

289
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:54,629
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and you know, I'd bring him in and yeah, it was good times and let's see Oh, we had a little DK toy and the DK toy that Donkey Kong toy would sit on the GameCube.

290
00:22:54,649 --> 00:23:00,363
Speaker 0: and You know, the DK is a rare event in Mario Party at least Mario Party 5.

291
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:08,426
Speaker 0: So whenever DK happened, it was like DK And it was a lot of fun, I think there are two more sticks.

292
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:15,170
Speaker 0: the One shtick was you know when it's you this time for a minigame in Mario Party?

293
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:19,008
Speaker 0: It displays like a list on the screen and then it randomly selects one of them.

294
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:22,724
Speaker 0: Everyone of course yells out the game that they want to play.

295
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:27,064
Speaker 1: now at this time I believe the the microphone for the GameCube.

296
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:28,170
Speaker 1: they did not have it.

297
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:37,284
Speaker 0: No The microphone for the GameCube didn't come out until Mario Party 6 or 7 and this is only Mario Party 5 6 wasn't out Yet, but they knew that it was someday going to exist.

298
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:37,846
Speaker 0: No, we didn't.

299
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:38,650
Speaker 1: I thought you did.

300
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,453
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

301
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:40,639
Speaker 1: Is there been rumors?

302
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,070
Speaker 0: No, we had no idea until much later.

303
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,314
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there were rumors.

304
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:45,157
Speaker 0: Well, we didn't know.

305
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:46,301
Speaker 0: we had no idea.

306
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:55,636
Speaker 0: what we did is whenever you know We made up a thing in our mind because you'd call out the minigame you wanted it to be and it would land on the Minigame you called out.

307
00:23:55,696 --> 00:24:01,750
Speaker 0: so we were like, oh there must be some sort of microphone in the GameCube That heard us calling out for that minigame and then it selected the one we wanted.

308
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:08,070
Speaker 0: So whenever you called out a minigame and then it selected the one you called out you would go microphone microphone.

309
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:14,302
Speaker 1: Now I'll say it this time that these are all mostly Scott and all their shiks because I had nothing to do with it.

310
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,627
Speaker 0: Yeah rim wasn't there remember?

311
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:16,872
Speaker 0: and When I?

312
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:18,136
Speaker 0: that's why I'm telling most of the story.

313
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,729
Speaker 1: when I found out about these they were mostly kind of uninteresting.

314
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:23,936
Speaker 0: today However, you ready?

315
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:26,590
Speaker 0: Here's the one that's important the vision.

316
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,411
Speaker 0: see in This.

317
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:41,317
Speaker 0: in Mario Party 5 the way the items work is you get an item ball from a gumball machine and you can choose to Either hold on to this item and pay some money to use it on yourself You know, which is always good.

318
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:51,248
Speaker 0: if it was like a wiggler or for absolutely no cost to you You could throw it at one to ten spaces and it would land on that space and inhabit it.

319
00:24:51,990 --> 00:25:00,710
Speaker 0: and If you were to land on that space or if anyone else were to land on that space at a later time It would be as if they had used that item on themselves.

320
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:07,415
Speaker 0: So, you know, let's say you got like, you know It's a good a spiky shell.

321
00:25:07,736 --> 00:25:15,129
Speaker 0: you could throw the spiky shell have it land on a spot and then Anyone who were to step there would have a spiky shell happen to them.

322
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:20,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so one of the items was the poison mushroom.

323
00:25:20,772 --> 00:25:25,170
Speaker 0: The poison mushroom makes you small and makes you walk very slowly.

324
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:31,617
Speaker 1: It only gives you one very small dice to roll so you it doesn't will die die It doesn't let you move very far if you land on it.

325
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:35,230
Speaker 0: Yes, so frugal, you know had a vision.

326
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:54,270
Speaker 0: He goes I have my vision I have a vision and his vision was to line up the poison mushrooms Just one after the other on the game board so that if you landed on one of them You'd be forced to roll a very small die and you would land on another one and be forced to roll a very small die.

327
00:25:54,912 --> 00:26:00,045
Speaker 1: Now at this point these gentlemen all decided that now they have to see this vision through.

328
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,030
Speaker 1: they have to strive to create the vision.

329
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,323
Speaker 0: So pretty much every game of Mario Party be played.

330
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:12,310
Speaker 0: since he came up with the vision We would take every single poison mushroom we had and just line them up on the board.

331
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:20,758
Speaker 0: And as we did it every time something happened either someone landing on one of the poison mushrooms or someone adding to the vision Frugal will go.

332
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,983
Speaker 0: my vision my vision And his vision came to be many times.

333
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,817
Speaker 1: now of all of that up I will venture forth the word crap.

334
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,930
Speaker 1: The vision is really the only one that I found funny and that stuck with us at all.

335
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other ones notice because we start.

336
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:42,090
Speaker 1: I mean the vision started coming with great frequency mostly from Scott mostly ignored But we had many visions nonetheless.

337
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,507
Speaker 0: Yes the vision was the only stick that's actually useful outside of silly Mario Party.

338
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:52,590
Speaker 0: and You know silly Mario Party ended as soon as school started and more interesting things happened because there were more people around.

339
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:57,326
Speaker 0: You're pretty much using the Mario Party as a means of entertainment.

340
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,233
Speaker 0: in the lonesome Rochester summer.

341
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:03,449
Speaker 1: Mario Party is a game that does nothing but kill time pretty much.

342
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,170
Speaker 1: Yeah It's not really that good a game.

343
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,655
Speaker 1: It just kills time.

344
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:11,572
Speaker 0: it would be a good game if they cut back on a lot of these slow useless Animation.

345
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:15,366
Speaker 0: it takes hurried up with the mini long to play that goddamn game.

346
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,350
Speaker 1: I can't deal with it.

347
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:25,630
Speaker 0: Yeah If they really if they they could do a lot to make Mario Party a much quicker play or at least have quick play Options where they wouldn't do extra useless animations.

348
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,727
Speaker 0: It would just you know, the die would immediately roll your guy would automatically move forward, you know, etc.

349
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:30,928
Speaker 0: Etc.

350
00:27:30,968 --> 00:27:31,088
Speaker 0: Etc.

351
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:35,367
Speaker 0: Not anyway, yeah now I'm not a Mario Party review.

352
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:41,078
Speaker 1: now I came back to Rochester because it was about that time when I was gonna move back into school and all that and hang out.

353
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:52,809
Speaker 1: so I come back and right before Scott tells me that He wants to challenge for the tag team championship belts and we need to do a two versus two Mario Party.

354
00:27:53,050 --> 00:28:09,866
Speaker 1: now I haven't played Mario Party in a while, at least especially not this Mario Party that I'd never played before Mm-hmm, but I I rose to the challenge and I decided alright I will come and we will play this for the honor of the front row crew for the honor of ourselves And for the belts against the current reigning champions.

355
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:14,285
Speaker 0: now I didn't give us very good chances of winning, but I had a vision.

356
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:15,650
Speaker 1: but I had a vision of us losing.

357
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:18,310
Speaker 0: Well, see I figured that we did have a chance at winning.

358
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:24,990
Speaker 0: I just didn't think that we were not the fear of the ever really the underdogs But we did have a chance, you know, despite this we were playing.

359
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,533
Speaker 1: I mean the game.

360
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:36,388
Speaker 1: there is much randomness in Mario Party and if we could have Befallen some great star and also despite the lack of my playing for a long time There are certain kinds of Mario Party games that I do not lose.

361
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:43,071
Speaker 1: that Yeah, and combined with Scott who has his own list of games that he does not lose that we were doing very well We could.

362
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:48,268
Speaker 0: we could have beaten most people at that Mario Party easily now because this was that I mean.

363
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:48,890
Speaker 1: this was the end.

364
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,115
Speaker 1: This was the world championship.

365
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:51,240
Speaker 1: This was for the belt.

366
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,370
Speaker 1: This wasn't just some piddly, you know class Joe.

367
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,938
Speaker 1: This was Mike Tyson versus Mike Tyson.

368
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,580
Speaker 0: Yep.

369
00:28:56,761 --> 00:28:59,470
Speaker 0: All right, so just imagine Mike Tyson boxing Mike Tyson.

370
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,666
Speaker 0: Okay, so first we'll tell the Mario Party and then we'll tell the bamboo.

371
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:03,208
Speaker 0: All right.

372
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:03,470
Speaker 1: All right.

373
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,153
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is the game starts and you know There's a lot of trash talk.

374
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,218
Speaker 1: trash talk was probably more important than the actual game.

375
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:17,064
Speaker 1: I agree and The vision played heavily because I had a vision of us winning at this point.

376
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:18,690
Speaker 1: our of my vision was strong.

377
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,673
Speaker 0: Yes, we were both.

378
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:26,178
Speaker 0: both teams were gaining stars at and somewhat equal rate, you know, like we got a star They got a star they got a star.

379
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:26,983
Speaker 0: We got a star.

380
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:33,950
Speaker 1: it was it was going good Everything was happening and cool and then there was a stretch where Scott and I were ahead by a star for a while.

381
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:35,060
Speaker 1: We were doing.

382
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,484
Speaker 1: I mean we were.

383
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:46,410
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah We were like a third of the way almost halfway through the game and we were you know doing really well And we were winning, you know about our fair share of the minigames and everything was going good.

384
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,700
Speaker 1: We were about a star ahead and we were gonna be okay.

385
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:53,633
Speaker 1: every time we they advanced we advance we're keeping them back We're keeping them at bay.

386
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:59,856
Speaker 0: They weren't winning enough games to overtake us and then in one turn Or I think maybe was two turns.

387
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:04,410
Speaker 0: All right, so it doesn't matter pretty much in the span of one to two turns of Mario party.

388
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,348
Speaker 0: We were stolen by the boo.

389
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:15,666
Speaker 1: First we played a duel Wherein they gained a star and we all right, you know, that's right.

390
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:20,989
Speaker 1: then They got a star legitimately.

391
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:28,050
Speaker 0: Then we landed on a star star which makes us lose a star.

392
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:36,378
Speaker 1: then Right after that we landed on a star two stars.

393
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:37,102
Speaker 0: you got to understand.

394
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:41,960
Speaker 0: in Mario Party a Star is a super rare terrible thing.

395
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,370
Speaker 0: that makes you lose a star into a bottomless pit.

396
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:47,224
Speaker 0: So but we were.

397
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:48,855
Speaker 1: you know One bad thing.

398
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:49,238
Speaker 1: I was like.

399
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:53,700
Speaker 1: we can still win another bad thing We can still win another thing we can still win.

400
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,210
Speaker 1: We landed on that second fucking star.

401
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:59,825
Speaker 1: I just dropped my controller and I just I just couldn't.

402
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:00,870
Speaker 1: I didn't even know what to say.

403
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:03,078
Speaker 1: I just and they didn't know what to say either.

404
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:03,982
Speaker 1: They weren't cheering.

405
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:11,080
Speaker 0: They were just sitting there like wow It's like the game which is a pretty even match of two on two.

406
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,575
Speaker 0: Mario Party became a complete and utter blowout Whereas we were destroyed by random Star.

407
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:28,900
Speaker 1: if you can picture it, there are four men playing Mario Party and suddenly in the middle of the game a Three horrid whirling cocks rise out of the GameCube.

408
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:33,030
Speaker 1: the controllers pin Scott and I down and sodomize us furiously.

409
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:35,743
Speaker 0: Yeah We got punned.

410
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:43,115
Speaker 0: So but now the game of that footage was randomness because after we got punned by the stars I will admit we started.

411
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:50,584
Speaker 0: we did not win the majority of the minigames after that point But I think a lot of it was just because you're so downtrodden from being anally raped.

412
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:51,829
Speaker 1: Our spirits were broken.

413
00:31:51,889 --> 00:32:00,124
Speaker 1: Yes I mean it got to the point like right after that I was like my turn began and I went from winning to no chance of winning.

414
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:03,801
Speaker 1: and I'm sitting there and I have items I'm just like, you know what whatever?

415
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:04,566
Speaker 1: and I say they

416
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:04,949
Speaker 0: yeah

417
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:05,717
Speaker 1: but

418
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:12,315
Speaker 0: after that point in the game we pretty much slowed our rate of star getting and They got a whole bunch more stars

419
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:21,547
Speaker 1: and also the game exploded into anarchy for a while in that everyone was yelling and screaming about The star after you know it said in what had just happened and we really all kind of got distracted.

420
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:29,507
Speaker 1: and I'll back it up a little bit because the Story we're about to tell has a little bit of backstory from maybe five minutes earlier before.

421
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,189
Speaker 1: this is our head.

422
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,906
Speaker 1: Yes Okay, now is at one point frugal or was it frugal?

423
00:32:33,288 --> 00:32:35,156
Speaker 0: I don't know It was very as soon as we got.

424
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,220
Speaker 0: you know what anytime.

425
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,364
Speaker 1: it's not mere Scott.

426
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:38,308
Speaker 1: I'll say it's in.

427
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:41,620
Speaker 0: Okay So where's when we got there, right?

428
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,704
Speaker 0: Someone made a cut.

429
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,410
Speaker 0: now you got to understand the layout of this room.

430
00:32:44,952 --> 00:32:59,749
Speaker 0: there is a kitchen there is a big-screen TV and There are people sitting all around the big-screen TV and the kitchen is to the left of the TV and to the right of the TV is like we're frugal and Ian are and closer to the kitchen is where me and rim are.

431
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,952
Speaker 0: and On that side of the room where frugal and Ian are there is a mini fridge and on top of the mini fridge It's like a lamp.

432
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:08,361
Speaker 0: Okay now over near them.

433
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:09,304
Speaker 0: There's another kid there.

434
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:16,129
Speaker 0: I forget his name and All right him yeah, and over he's sitting near the mini fridge and he's complaining about a nasty smell.

435
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:18,940
Speaker 0: and He complained about it like when we got there.

436
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,280
Speaker 0: and he complained about it a little while later and It was he didn't do anything about.

437
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,510
Speaker 1: he was like man something smells.

438
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:33,885
Speaker 0: We got to clean this place out and he and her girl like yeah, whatever Yeah, I think someone looked in the mini fridge once and was like, you know Cuz it was coming from that area which is far away from us because we weren't smelling it.

439
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:39,010
Speaker 0: and you know They didn't see anything in there, but like soda cans and beer cans and whatever.

440
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:42,503
Speaker 0: So, you know, they were like, uh, I guess nothing's rotting in the fridge.

441
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:43,306
Speaker 0: What could it be?

442
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:43,767
Speaker 0: Whatever?

443
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:44,550
Speaker 1: so we ignore.

444
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,538
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't even smell anything so I didn't care.

445
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,104
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and the game's going on.

446
00:33:48,124 --> 00:33:49,750
Speaker 1: and then you know right before the star.

447
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:55,170
Speaker 1: I remember Ian or might have been frugal, but one of them who wasn't I don't remember when exactly.

448
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,990
Speaker 0: It was definitely during the game because it interrupted the star was it but this wasn't the interruption.

449
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,930
Speaker 1: They just said like, you know, I kind of smell like vomit or something.

450
00:34:04,031 --> 00:34:07,534
Speaker 0: It definitely had a vomit atious smell and everyone Amethyst odor.

451
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:14,578
Speaker 1: so Ian says something like I kind of smell vomit and we all look and we sniff around over like Whatever I don't see any vomit.

452
00:34:14,598 --> 00:34:15,482
Speaker 1: let's finish the game.

453
00:34:15,563 --> 00:34:17,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we were still winning at this point.

454
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,569
Speaker 1: I was still on high spirits.

455
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:26,994
Speaker 1: So after the second star and after my life was ruined and my ass was sodomized but before the end of the game Suddenly frugal sits up.

456
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,158
Speaker 1: He's like, you know what?

457
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,922
Speaker 1: I still smell vomit vomit.

458
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:31,127
Speaker 1: There's vomit somewhere.

459
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:31,969
Speaker 1: I gotta find it.

460
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

461
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,757
Speaker 0: he were complaining.

462
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:35,827
Speaker 0: it must have been a rank rank odor.

463
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,655
Speaker 0: if they were, you know They couldn't stand it.

464
00:34:37,715 --> 00:34:40,649
Speaker 0: They had to get up and find the source of the vomit smell.

465
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,721
Speaker 1: now It was just frugal.

466
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:42,369
Speaker 1: I think that stood up.

467
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,937
Speaker 0: I'll say I don't remember but it was.

468
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:46,810
Speaker 0: everyone started looking around trying to find the source of the smell.

469
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:54,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, though it started out with just like one of them stood up while we're playing Yeah, sniffing around and then everyone else is like, ah, if you're gonna do this, then we can't play until you're done.

470
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:55,969
Speaker 1: We better find this odor.

471
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,141
Speaker 1: Yeah And I still couldn't smell anything.

472
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:58,987
Speaker 1: and they're sniffing around.

473
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:04,370
Speaker 1: and you know I walk over to the kitchen and I look in the garbage dispose and I look in the garbage and there's nothing around.

474
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:08,724
Speaker 1: And he's like like he starts taking stuff out of the fridge and trying to see if there's anything.

475
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:12,410
Speaker 0: they're taking stuff out of the cabinets Even though the smell is coming from the other side of the room.

476
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:17,450
Speaker 0: I was assuming that the smell was coming from outside the window, which is right behind the mini fridge.

477
00:35:17,631 --> 00:35:18,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I started.

478
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:21,030
Speaker 0: I was like, let's go outside and look for a dead skunk or something.

479
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:23,910
Speaker 1: I started looking under the couches, you know, maybe a dead animal outside.

480
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,328
Speaker 1: I was convinced that someone had vomited somewhere and hidden it or something something like that.

481
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,530
Speaker 0: Of course, all the couches are raised up with their stadium seating.

482
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:46,727
Speaker 0: So and then I'll say in because I don't remember who did it suddenly like goes bolt upright and goes It's right there and he goes, you know He leans over to sniff at this thing and I couldn't really tell what it was from where I was.

483
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:47,670
Speaker 0: any backs off.

484
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:54,825
Speaker 1: That's off and he's like, it's the bamboo That fucking bamboo fucking bamboo and we're like what no way.

485
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:56,230
Speaker 0: So I was like a bamboo.

486
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:57,798
Speaker 0: I wasn't quite sure what they're talking about.

487
00:35:57,818 --> 00:36:00,210
Speaker 0: I'm looking out for like a giant bamboo stick or something.

488
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,340
Speaker 1: So Ian walks over that he's like, what do you mean?

489
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,450
Speaker 1: And he's like right there and he points at the little bamboo.

490
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:14,694
Speaker 1: He's like what and he's yeah He doesn't gingerly he leans over and goes and then he makes a noise like Like he's about to vomit.

491
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:19,390
Speaker 0: Yeah now we I didn't quite understand what they meant by the bamboo.

492
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,280
Speaker 0: I mean, I knew what bamboo is but I wasn't like.

493
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,990
Speaker 0: I was like is there a stick of bamboo somewhere in this house?

494
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,598
Speaker 0: That's all rotting or what?

495
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:39,170
Speaker 0: It was his little tiny porcelain Pot thingy with dirt in it and a little tiny bamboo shoot coming out of it Maybe like a few inches long and there was only like a half inch of dirt and the rest was just water.

496
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:44,164
Speaker 0: Yes, there was standing water in this tiny little and the water was clear.

497
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:46,110
Speaker 1: There's nothing floating in the water.

498
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:49,329
Speaker 0: It was clear water with dirt under it and a shoot of bamboo.

499
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:55,710
Speaker 1: So, you know Ian backs off, you know making this gagging noise and fruits like say say see as someone vomited in the bamboo.

500
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,542
Speaker 1: And then it's like but it's clear through his gagging.

501
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:02,030
Speaker 0: All right, so now Scott is sitting down.

502
00:37:02,171 --> 00:37:02,997
Speaker 0: I'm sitting in my.

503
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:04,550
Speaker 0: everyone goes back to their seats.

504
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:10,236
Speaker 0: you know like Natalie found the source of the odor and Ian was going to Dispose of the bamboo.

505
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:14,313
Speaker 0: as we all sat and waited for him to get that over with because no one else wanted to be near The thing.

506
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,729
Speaker 1: now I didn't really believe him that it smelled that bad.

507
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:20,446
Speaker 0: So he brought it over, you know to different people in the room like here.

508
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:21,470
Speaker 0: smell it man smell it.

509
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,022
Speaker 0: So everyone was able to experience the.

510
00:37:24,324 --> 00:37:31,930
Speaker 1: the problem is he's walking across Hazel pleasant, you know, I forget who bumped it, but I think it was you know, I remember exactly the bumping.

511
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:32,541
Speaker 0: I remember.

512
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:33,009
Speaker 0: yes.

513
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:46,288
Speaker 0: So he's bringing it around the room and then he brings it to me Right and he's like trying to bring it near me like he got a smell and I didn't want to you know Even though everyone else wanted to have their olfactory nerves stimulated by the amazing bamboo.

514
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:52,045
Speaker 0: I Yeah, I decided I would rather you know avoid having the reason.

515
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:53,770
Speaker 1: I was curious because I didn't believe them.

516
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,697
Speaker 1: I was convinced that there was something in there.

517
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:59,490
Speaker 0: I didn't want to have the odor of puke infecting my nasal passages.

518
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:07,863
Speaker 0: So as he brought it over to me to have me smell it I put my hand out to do like the Kramer like, you know, stop with the flat hand.

519
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:17,769
Speaker 1: and it bumped now like a drop of the liquid that was in this little container fell out and like bounced off a Scott and kind of rolled away.

520
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:19,456
Speaker 1: and There was one drop.

521
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,350
Speaker 0: Well, no, it wasn't one drop a little tiny bit.

522
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:24,924
Speaker 0: There was quite a. it was basically a splash.

523
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:25,930
Speaker 0: It was like splash.

524
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,094
Speaker 1: It was a tiny little.

525
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:32,430
Speaker 0: there was one splash that got drops on me on the chair and on some other things.

526
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:36,230
Speaker 1: There was less than up an inch and a half of water in this thing.

527
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,890
Speaker 0: It was very little water, but it was a. it was a splash.

528
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:45,407
Speaker 0: It's like as if you took you know, it's like you had a glass of juice and you drank it all but then you know There's always some left.

529
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:51,281
Speaker 0: It was like if he took all of that and splashed it around the room But there was still a lot left in the container.

530
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:53,350
Speaker 0: there was left in the little thing.

531
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,133
Speaker 1: yes, it was a tiny amount and a Relatively tiny.

532
00:38:57,174 --> 00:39:01,687
Speaker 1: so this tiny amount of liquid has entered the room now and has dissipated itself.

533
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:02,830
Speaker 1: It is no longer as cohesive.

534
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:10,510
Speaker 1: it is now spread out and At this point no one in the room could speak or we were all trying to not vomit.

535
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:13,543
Speaker 0: It was the most rank odor.

536
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,130
Speaker 0: I think I have ever experienced.

537
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,189
Speaker 1: It was the worst thing I've ever smelled and I stepped in a dead deer once uh-huh.

538
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,360
Speaker 0: But oh my god, you had no idea.

539
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,849
Speaker 0: like there was a drop of it on me.

540
00:39:24,273 --> 00:39:28,157
Speaker 0: There's a drop of it on the chair Drop of it like on the couch.

541
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:35,890
Speaker 1: Scott ran away like trying to get away from it But like the kid who had the string of firecrackers taped to his leg.

542
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:37,997
Speaker 1: He could not get away because it was on him.

543
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,395
Speaker 0: It was it was the worst smell ever When it.

544
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:47,428
Speaker 1: I mean the exact secret of splash pause gag scream.

545
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:53,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean they quickly managed to dispose of the actual bamboo itself after this point.

546
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,742
Speaker 0: But everyone the room exploded.

547
00:39:55,843 --> 00:40:03,510
Speaker 0: everyone was like, oh god Oh god running around screaming trying to clean this up and rid the world of this odor now in as soon as possible.

548
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,589
Speaker 1: Now these there's still some left in the thing.

549
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:10,010
Speaker 1: So he reads decides that the rest of this liquid needs to go away forever.

550
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:23,389
Speaker 1: So he runs into the kitchen with what's left of it and he dumps it down the drain and Then he starts running hot water over it and that Unleashed the final smell that that just filled the room.

551
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:27,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you'd think that doing that would send the odor to its death.

552
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,530
Speaker 0: But no, apparently the odor must have been coming from the dirt or it was most concentrated under the water.

553
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:41,290
Speaker 0: So by doing that he actually started, you know Disseminating the odor quite a bit and it you couldn't even go near the kitchen anymore.

554
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:48,149
Speaker 0: It was like oh god until eventually a few minutes later It did all get washed away when they took the bamboo out to the trash.

555
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:53,123
Speaker 1: Of course, the first thing we thought was we should give this bamboo to someone.

556
00:40:53,785 --> 00:41:06,539
Speaker 0: obviously magical obviously But it was much ruckus for quite a few minutes Perhaps 10 to 15 minutes running around the room trying to clean up and get the odor out opening windows blowing fans Spraying Febreze all kinds of stuff.

557
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,270
Speaker 1: It was the worst thing I've ever smelled in my life.

558
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it didn't just smell like vomit.

559
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:14,588
Speaker 0: It's not like vomit.

560
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:15,110
Speaker 0: think about this.

561
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:28,475
Speaker 0: you have a very small amount of liquid in a glass right and standing about five feet away from this glass smells like someone vomited in the room and It's a very small amount of liquid.

562
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,570
Speaker 0: going near it and smelling it makes you gag and almost vomit yourself.

563
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:38,690
Speaker 0: Spilling that liquid everywhere makes the room explode and people run around yelling and screaming.

564
00:41:39,352 --> 00:41:44,427
Speaker 0: Now dumping it down the sink and pouring hot water after it makes people flee the apartment.

565
00:41:44,507 --> 00:41:45,490
Speaker 0: That's how bad it is.

566
00:41:45,974 --> 00:41:58,970
Speaker 0: So after about an hour I would have paid someone like a hundred dollars to just take the thing and either like Drink some amount of the water or just put their nose right into it and take a big ol whiff.

567
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:02,490
Speaker 1: I just would have walked into Gracie's and knocked it over and walked away.

568
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:07,729
Speaker 1: That would have been hilarious Especially if I made some vomitous noises right beforehand.

569
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:16,953
Speaker 1: No, even better you just put it on the little conveyor that goes into the I Mean.

570
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:21,270
Speaker 1: people used to put you know gloves filled with stuff and pennies in the rolls.

571
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:23,603
Speaker 1: Someone put a glass of that pennies in the rolls.

572
00:42:23,643 --> 00:42:28,349
Speaker 1: I never understood that one You realize because it made a horrid ruckus and a mess.

573
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:33,650
Speaker 0: I know but it's like they'd have to know what was going on behind there in order to know that that would cause trouble.

574
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,032
Speaker 1: You know what?

575
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,421
Speaker 1: They did know because everyone knew.

576
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:36,830
Speaker 1: okay anyway.

577
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:48,910
Speaker 1: So after about an hour we calm down and then you know, we're trying to finish the game of Mario Party But it's over and we're basically no one's saying anything other than what the fuck was that?

578
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:49,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, what the fuck?

579
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:53,869
Speaker 0: this is now the phase of what was making that bamboo smell so bad.

580
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,710
Speaker 1: I mean literally the conversation was like what the fuck was that the fuck?

581
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,412
Speaker 1: I don't know.

582
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:01,462
Speaker 0: was there a bacteria growing in there, but it was clear.

583
00:43:01,543 --> 00:43:05,997
Speaker 0: does bamboo have some sort of Odorific properties that we were unaware of?

584
00:43:06,078 --> 00:43:08,164
Speaker 1: was it some kind of vomit bamboo.

585
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:09,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like what the hell was it?

586
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,557
Speaker 1: No, we sure it was the vamp bamboo.

587
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:14,130
Speaker 1: What if it was just someone poured a liquid in there?

588
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,269
Speaker 1: What if it was a practical joke and someone poured some art stuff in there?

589
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,301
Speaker 1: What if the container broke and there was something in it?

590
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:21,787
Speaker 1: What if aliens came?

591
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,554
Speaker 0: Yeah We had no idea.

592
00:43:24,595 --> 00:43:28,290
Speaker 0: maybe it was you know, the some fertilizer in the little bamboo plant.

593
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,313
Speaker 0: Maybe it was the dirt.

594
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:31,239
Speaker 0: Maybe who knows we had no idea.

595
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,282
Speaker 0: It was a mystery.

596
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:33,326
Speaker 0: It's still a mystery.

597
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:35,994
Speaker 0: Google didn't even know But yeah,

598
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:57,790
Speaker 1: well eventually we found the answer that apparently Bamboo plants that grow in water like that, especially confined are somewhat susceptible to a number of Infection not really infections, but there are things that will grow in the water that make a smell like that And apparently whatever conditions that little bit of bamboo had been sitting in were exactly perfect for that thing.

599
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:08,549
Speaker 1: Whatever it is to fry I think it was mainly due to the being on top of the mini fridge and thus being warmed up I think also not being moved or disturbed in any way for like a year.

600
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:12,407
Speaker 0: I don't know how old the bamboo was because it wasn't in my apartment.

601
00:44:12,447 --> 00:44:15,081
Speaker 0: It was in an apartment I only went to to play Mario Party.

602
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:15,765
Speaker 1: there was a win.

603
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:20,810
Speaker 1: when they picked it up I remember there was definitely a lot of dust around it and no dust under it.

604
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,015
Speaker 1: It had been there a while.

605
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,164
Speaker 0: Well, you know apartments pick up does pretty quick.

606
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,476
Speaker 0: So that's not a hundred percent It's a good tell.

607
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:29,204
Speaker 0: Maybe it was just rotting dust.

608
00:44:29,264 --> 00:44:31,902
Speaker 1: I don't know dust Yeah, just a random guess.

609
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:38,549
Speaker 0: but yeah, that is the story of the vision and the bamboo.

610
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,536
Speaker 1: now The moral here.

611
00:44:42,238 --> 00:44:43,522
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna play the wave file.

612
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:46,230
Speaker 1: Oh you suck because the wave file is so low quality.

613
00:44:46,991 --> 00:44:50,910
Speaker 1: Fine if you find me a better wave file, which you did but you never gave to me and I'm not waiting.

614
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,060
Speaker 0: I didn't find a better one.

615
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:52,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did.

616
00:44:52,928 --> 00:44:56,203
Speaker 1: I did I the one you played from the DVD a little while ago.

617
00:44:56,223 --> 00:44:57,669
Speaker 0: Oh that one.

618
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:05,028
Speaker 1: Anyway, the moral of this story is that if life gives you shit Throw it away and make lemonade.

619
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:14,650
Speaker 1: Might not make sense, but consider this in the course of that day We lost the world championship of Mario Party and the championship belts.

620
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,339
Speaker 1: Yep by a lot we got.

621
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,550
Speaker 0: we got smelly ass bamboo all over ourselves.

622
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:25,530
Speaker 1: Yes, and despite that it was one of the funniest days we've ever had.

623
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it was a total party.

624
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:29,423
Speaker 0: Everyone had a lot of fun.

625
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:31,450
Speaker 0: Everyone had great stories to tell from it.

626
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:37,590
Speaker 0: You know, it's like hey life gave us Vomit smelling bamboo, but that day was awesome.

627
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:39,176
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people cuz.

628
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:44,604
Speaker 1: actually I remember a long time ago like when I when I was a junior Seeing I think was when I was a junior at RIT.

629
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:58,049
Speaker 1: I wrote an article I might have been a senior for Gracie's Dinnertime Theatre and the article I wrote was basically I'm always happy haha, and I got a lot of hate mail from this about you're not happy you're lying.

630
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:20,438
Speaker 1: and I think that the only real difference between me and all those people not just me but you know the crew in general me and Scott and the whole front row crew was that When good things happen, we laugh and enjoy them and when bad things happen We laugh and enjoy them as best we can and in the very least no matter how bad something is that happens to any of us No matter how bad it is.

631
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,929
Speaker 1: At least there's a good story to tell about it.

632
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:42,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you can even make jokes about 9/11 that are funny, you know I mean sure when something serious you got to deal with it seriously but that doesn't mean that you have to be you know, personally upset and Unhappy and you know tormented and depressed, you know you.

633
00:46:43,144 --> 00:46:45,914
Speaker 0: something terrible happens, you know You deal with it.

634
00:46:45,954 --> 00:46:47,561
Speaker 0: Seriously, you treat it seriously.

635
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:57,881
Speaker 0: your actions are you know Respectable and such and you know, you don't you know say certain things to certain people But you know you still you gotta.

636
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:00,850
Speaker 0: if you don't make the best of it You're just gonna become a depressed loser.

637
00:47:01,092 --> 00:47:04,599
Speaker 1: If any time something bad happens to you The best thing you can do is just remember that.

638
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:06,247
Speaker 1: now you've got one hell of a story to tell.

639
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,355
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, remember that time I got shot.

640
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:09,178
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

641
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:16,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if it's like an ultra terrible story like oh my god Horrible things happened, you know, I mean we know something.

642
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:22,534
Speaker 1: I mean we have friends in the crew who you know survived cancer and they joke about it Constantly.

643
00:47:22,595 --> 00:47:25,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you need to do and is what you need to do.

644
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:39,154
Speaker 0: so the next time you get smelly ass bamboo water all over your shirt and You know you almost puke a couple times in addition to getting starred Twice in one game in the span of 1.5 rounds of that game.

645
00:47:39,174 --> 00:47:51,259
Speaker 0: Yep Just go to some forum on the internet somewhere and tell the story or write it in your blog or make a podcast about it Or just tell your friends at conventions and it'll be a good fun time.

646
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:57,160
Speaker 1: I really wish there was a way for me to send the smell of that bamboo over TCP IP to all of you out there.

647
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,009
Speaker 0: Well Smelter net is not yet up and running.

648
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:02,795
Speaker 1: I don't think we're not kidding.

649
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:04,140
Speaker 1: That was the worst thing I've ever smelled.

650
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I've set off stink bombs.

651
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,845
Speaker 1: I found dead not human bodies But I found dead things before.

652
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:13,216
Speaker 0: dead animals smell dead animals like one of the worst smells ever.

653
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:14,480
Speaker 0: bamboo was worse.

654
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:23,622
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean I once let a sack of potatoes rot and Rotting potatoes smell apparently a lot like a rotting human corpse in the certain conditions Mm-hmm.

655
00:48:23,883 --> 00:48:27,480
Speaker 1: That was not even a quarter as disturbing as the smell of that bamboo.

656
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:28,858
Speaker 0: It was bad.

657
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:36,160
Speaker 0: I think it was mostly due to the strength of the odor and also the fact that we were taken completely flat-footed by that.

658
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:47,467
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the the scene was that there's this bad smell and the guy, you know he's walking over with the thing and he's gonna dispose of it after letting everyone realize how bad it is and In the span of like a second.

659
00:48:47,567 --> 00:48:50,720
Speaker 1: it goes from this little, you know, like a minorly bad odor.

660
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:51,222
Speaker 0: It's in.

661
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:55,219
Speaker 0: it's basically an incredibly strong odor contained in an incredibly small place.

662
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,651
Speaker 0: It was we let the cat out of the bag.

663
00:48:57,872 --> 00:48:59,560
Speaker 1: It was a flashbang of odor.

664
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:05,600
Speaker 1: Yeah If the SWAT team wanted to get us all all they'd have to do was throw one of those little bamboo fuckers into the room.

665
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,424
Speaker 1: And that's the end of us.

666
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:08,596
