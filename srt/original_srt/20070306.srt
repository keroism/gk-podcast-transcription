1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,326
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday March 6th.

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:12,389
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,558
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,178
Speaker 0: We review.

5
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:28,353
Speaker 1: Phoenix writes This past weekend was a mighty good weekend of gaming.

6
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:34,957
Speaker 0: I must say yeah We haven't played some board games in a little bit, and we cranked out like four or five.

7
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:40,013
Speaker 1: I think right yeah Yeah, we even played one of my favorite games even though something horrible happened.

8
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:42,000
Speaker 1: We played motherfucking Shogun.

9
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:43,298
Speaker 0: We did an episode.

10
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:49,118
Speaker 0: well We did an episode in all the Milton Bradley game master series games at least the ones that we played.

11
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,000
Speaker 1: yeah But me Alex and Scott decided hey want to play Shogun?

12
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,504
Speaker 1: Yes Let's play Shogun.

13
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:59,240
Speaker 1: and we spent an hour learning the rules again because we always forget since they're kind of arbitrary.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,557
Speaker 1: You know non-german game that tries to be all German style war game whatever.

15
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:07,474
Speaker 1: so we're playing and In the second round of the game it was the third round.

16
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:10,311
Speaker 1: I think might yeah It was the third round because I was leveled up a little bit.

17
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:19,100
Speaker 1: anyway right away I Scott built a little fortress, and he has his general is sitting there, and he thinks that he's perfectly invincible.

18
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:23,380
Speaker 0: He's on a coast, so I didn't think I was invincible, but I thought I was safe enough.

19
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:27,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you were on a coast in a fortress with a moderately powerful army.

20
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:41,139
Speaker 1: However, I had set up this masterful swinging door plan where all three of my generals were gonna faint like they were just securing Territory and then in the third round they were all going to suddenly turn on.

21
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:46,786
Speaker 1: Scott I was going to utterly destroy him before Alex could even react Alrighty, and it was a beautiful plan.

22
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:50,720
Speaker 1: now Scott thinking he was safe in this fortress didn't worry too much and was utterly.

23
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,766
Speaker 0: I worried a little bit.

24
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:52,751
Speaker 0: I was looking over there.

25
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,279
Speaker 1: You were a little bit.

26
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:57,073
Speaker 0: I was a little bit worried, but I decided just go with it.

27
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:04,480
Speaker 1: You were a little bit Nonplussed when I said that my army was attacking you over the sea at your fortune.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,406
Speaker 0: Well cuz I figured there was like a 20% chance you would do it and then when you did it It was like oh the 20% chance was actually 100%.

29
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:15,682
Speaker 1: whoa well the thing is I bought a whole bunch of Ronan right before that Battle.

30
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:17,307
Speaker 0: when you bought those Ronan.

31
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,434
Speaker 0: I was pretty sure you put them in that army.

32
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:20,076
Speaker 0: I was like 90%.

33
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:20,236
Speaker 0: sure.

34
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:25,467
Speaker 0: I You know sounds like But I just let it slide.

35
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:27,415
Speaker 1: yep, so the battle ensued.

36
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,640
Speaker 0: cuz I mean what was the alternative?

37
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:35,445
Speaker 0: I could have backed out of the already built fortress saved my daimyo and Given you a fortress.

38
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,595
Speaker 1: I. what I would have done is not built the fortress or put the.

39
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:43,594
Speaker 0: I had built the fortress many rounds Prior if it was that round and you had just built the Ronan.

40
00:02:43,654 --> 00:02:45,020
Speaker 0: I would not have put a fortress there.

41
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:46,164
Speaker 0: I generally.

42
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:48,172
Speaker 1: I just in a many-player game.

43
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,422
Speaker 1: I would use fortresses, but in a three-player game I wouldn't.

44
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:51,729
Speaker 0: but anyway anyway.

45
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,599
Speaker 1: I killed Scott's daimyo.

46
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,327
Speaker 1: Well gawa marched up.

47
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:57,376
Speaker 0: well here's the thing is Scott fucked up.

48
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,200
Speaker 1: Oh, he fucked up.

49
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:03,920
Speaker 1: No, don't say we you didn't notice either Cuz your it was your duty as the defender to array all of your unit.

50
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't come yell at me for not noticing something you didn't notice cuz I didn't care.

51
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:13,279
Speaker 0: yeah, but anyway You know you probably would have beat me even if we had noticed.

52
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:21,347
Speaker 0: But we didn't notice that some of my guys were not counted and thus we had concluded the combat But we had done it incorrectly.

53
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,052
Speaker 1: yeah Scott had two extra spearman.

54
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:23,695
Speaker 1: he forgot to count.

55
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:25,240
Speaker 1: they would had almost no effect on the.

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,492
Speaker 0: they would have had a slight effect on the battle.

57
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:38,540
Speaker 0: almost no effect a Significant effect because they would have taken two hits before Two gunmen would have taken hits and they would have fired again, and yeah doesn't really matter it matters enough.

58
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,110
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter a lot, but it matters enough.

59
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,440
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter enough because it didn't matter at all.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,422
Speaker 1: I was pretty much guaranteed to win that game anyway because I had a master plan set up and There's nothing to do with it.

61
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:53,208
Speaker 0: the point was the point was rim refused to recalculate the battle.

62
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:57,269
Speaker 0: that was not correct and Rather than play a screwed-up game.

63
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:01,690
Speaker 1: Well, it was more complicated than that because you see what happened was there.

64
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,857
Speaker 1: We couldn't replay the battle because I didn't remember exactly what was in the army when I started you the one always claiming that Your memory is so vastly superior.

65
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:11,784
Speaker 0: You couldn't remember something from two minutes ago.

66
00:04:11,804 --> 00:04:13,710
Speaker 1: I never really claimed my memory is superior.

67
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,156
Speaker 1: I'm actually fairly forgetful hence.

68
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:18,668
Speaker 1: I forgot how many units were in that are.

69
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,000
Speaker 0: well now I got that recorded for a future you know.

70
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:27,350
Speaker 1: the interesting thing was that Scott admitted Then that even if he hadn't screwed up the combat he would have quit the game anyway.

71
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:28,753
Speaker 0: No I might not have.

72
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:34,393
Speaker 1: no you said very clearly and I have Alex to back it up that once you lost your are one of your three armies.

73
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:41,539
Speaker 1: you decided that the game was not fun and not worth playing and you were gonna the game that the Fun of the game did significantly decline at that point.

74
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,743
Speaker 1: Yeah, either way.

75
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:46,173
Speaker 1: I just think you have bad taste in war games Whatever.

76
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:47,599
Speaker 1: I mean you like battle are.

77
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,890
Speaker 0: the thing is Shogun is a really fun.

78
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:57,437
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fun, but the problem is it's not fun, but you're losing and you're no no It's nothing to do with losing even if you're winning.

79
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,050
Speaker 0: the game is not fun after like three or four rounds.

80
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not fun from beginning to end.

81
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:04,201
Speaker 0: It's like risk.

82
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,288
Speaker 0: It's fun, and that's not fun.

83
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:06,910
Speaker 1: I disagree.

84
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,370
Speaker 1: I've every time I've played it's been fun all the way to the end whether I was winning or losing.

85
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:12,762
Speaker 0: Every time I've played it has been not fun.

86
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:16,521
Speaker 1: about a third way through the game I think that's usually because you end up with one dime.

87
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,545
Speaker 1: You're hiding in the corner.

88
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:22,618
Speaker 0: I've won Shogun And it was still not fun.

89
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:29,129
Speaker 1: anyway Scott quit the game so Alex And I pissed Lee had to stop because there's no way we could continue playing.

90
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:29,370
Speaker 1: well.

91
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,399
Speaker 0: well, I mean is the is the dilemma right?

92
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:36,119
Speaker 0: let's say there's three people playing a game right and Everyone is enjoying the game.

93
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:42,227
Speaker 0: then suddenly something happens It doesn't matter what it is and now one person is no longer enjoying the game.

94
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,095
Speaker 0: in fact there It would be unfun.

95
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:45,722
Speaker 0: It would be upsetting to them.

96
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:48,973
Speaker 0: so they have to continue playing the game Should you know?

97
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:55,210
Speaker 0: obviously that person would be very nice if they would you know give some self-sacrifice to suffer for the?

98
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,609
Speaker 0: Entertainment of the two people who would still like to continue playing the game.

99
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:05,758
Speaker 0: But you know then does the question of huh well that maybe ruin the game if one person doesn't really care about it But they're still playing?

100
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,089
Speaker 0: just see it's sake of it.

101
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:14,700
Speaker 1: If you're a nice person or in any way upstanding if you commit to a board game You've committed to the end unless the majority of players agree to quit.

102
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:17,510
Speaker 1: so if you renege on that then you're a jackass.

103
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,635
Speaker 0: That's my standing an ass.

104
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:24,270
Speaker 0: you may be but if that if you were the guy you know would you do it?

105
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,024
Speaker 0: Would you guess why?

106
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:25,167
Speaker 1: yes?

107
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:36,270
Speaker 1: I've kept playing many times in a game where I had already lost and I didn't care or I was otherwise not having fun for Whatever reason because I would not renege on something that I had committed to.

108
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:38,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know It's tough.

109
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,793
Speaker 0: Maybe like you know there were some other factors like if we had not messed up the battle and I was still losing and still Not having fun.

110
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:49,156
Speaker 0: I might have continued to play also if it was earlier in the day I might have continued to play.

111
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:52,170
Speaker 1: whatever the point is you quit, and we couldn't play our game.

112
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,439
Speaker 0: That's true because it wasn't fun anymore.

113
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,021
Speaker 0: more important.

114
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:55,483
Speaker 1: Thank you.

115
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,547
Speaker 1: We yeah, you suck.

116
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:59,100
Speaker 1: more importantly We played another game of Vinci.

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,294
Speaker 1: now Vinci is not a game Where ties are likely.

118
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:07,750
Speaker 1: the fact the odds of tying in a game of Vinci just considering how many points and rounds are involved?

119
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,374
Speaker 0: Pretty slim especially if you have few players Then it's real hard now.

120
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:28,830
Speaker 1: despite that in the two of the last two games There has been a tie First between myself and Scott and now between Alex and myself and the game and where Alex and rim tied the most recent game I only lost but I was behind them by two points.

121
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,158
Speaker 1: I think the three of us have played.

122
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:37,922
Speaker 1: this is one of those situations where the three of us have played a game enough to the point where we're all equally skilled.

123
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,831
Speaker 1: now, and it's just a matter of I don't know.

124
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:49,656
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of what civilization tiles come up in what combination and who takes them and when I think it comes I mean it comes down to Declining one thing.

125
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:52,407
Speaker 1: once one round too soon you lose.

126
00:07:52,427 --> 00:08:00,167
Speaker 0: yep There was one thing in that whole game that I declined a little air But Alex on the next round declined to say his thing.

127
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:00,690
Speaker 0: a little air.

128
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:03,689
Speaker 0: So it evened out, and that's why I was you know right up there.

129
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:06,299
Speaker 1: Oh, well, but anyway before we do the news.

130
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,808
Speaker 1: I got to do a geek back because this is really important.

131
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,139
Speaker 1: now It's not even a normal geek back in fact.

132
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,110
Speaker 1: It's a reverse geek back.

133
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:17,250
Speaker 1: I'm geeking back to someone else because you know they're listening.

134
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,017
Speaker 1: I'm assuming they're listening.

135
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,950
Speaker 1: if they're not they'd better because this affects them directly.

136
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,637
Speaker 1: This is a call-out if you will.

137
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,130
Speaker 1: you see I listen to Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentleman.

138
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:28,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, listen to that too.

139
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:40,490
Speaker 1: and the other day They were talking about various things and at one point the topic of air hockey came up And a comment was made that essentially said air hockey is a game of chance what?

140
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,416
Speaker 1: Now that's ridiculous.

141
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:44,304
Speaker 1: I was in my car where they were.

142
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:45,690
Speaker 0: they smoking weed during this.

143
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,450
Speaker 1: I was in my car, and I said what and I rewound it.

144
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:56,539
Speaker 1: I listened again to make sure that they had actually said that and then I stopped listening And I stewed about it for the rest of the day.

145
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,282
Speaker 0: all right all right.

146
00:08:57,423 --> 00:09:13,418
Speaker 0: if air hockey is a game of chance Then if any two people on earth any to play against each other right any number of times Then they will each win about half the time assuming the table is symmetrical and working and such.

147
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,465
Speaker 1: now you can even make allowances like they might be.

148
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:23,991
Speaker 1: I mean they might have actually Meant that it's largely chance and a small bit of skill in which case still the odds of winning or losing are maybe 60/40 At most.

149
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:33,763
Speaker 0: however I know from experience that a skilled air hockey player will beat an Unskilled air hockey player almost 100% of the time.

150
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:40,875
Speaker 1: now We're not gonna do a whole thing about air hockey here because we're gonna say gonna do a separate show on air hockey in the Future.

151
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:46,730
Speaker 1: yeah, maybe a Tuesday Maybe a Thursday because it is a game, but also Thursdays are lacking for content, and it's not a video game.

152
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,029
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about air hockey video games which all suck.

153
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:56,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is that they've made this statement And if it had been any other game if they had said this about anything.

154
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,810
Speaker 1: I would have not even noticed or cared.

155
00:09:58,851 --> 00:09:59,787
Speaker 1: I would have laughed a little bit.

156
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:04,623
Speaker 1: But it just so happens that I'm really good at air hockey.

157
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,528
Speaker 1: Scott is also really good at air.

158
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:09,978
Speaker 0: We're both Really good at air hockey now.

159
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,070
Speaker 1: lately I've been on the uptick and I've been winning more than Scott.

160
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:17,902
Speaker 1: But there have been times when the opposite has been true And there will be times again when the opposite will be true.

161
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:22,630
Speaker 1: we oscillate back and forth But no one else can beat us except professional air hockey players.

162
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically if me and rim beat it you know play each other in air hockey.

163
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,370
Speaker 0: We don't know who's gonna win and it tends to go in streaks.

164
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:34,249
Speaker 0: But if we ever play any of our friends in air hockey they have never beaten us.

165
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:39,225
Speaker 0: We have pretty much undefeated against our friends in air hockey except each other.

166
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:42,215
Speaker 1: yes now granted in some ways That's the small pond syndrome.

167
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:55,250
Speaker 1: I mean until I got to RIT my sophomore year I was in my life undefeated at arcade air hockey And then Luke Morgan beat me and I realized that I had been playing against chumps up until that point.

168
00:10:55,611 --> 00:10:56,254
Speaker 0: Well, he had it.

169
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:57,339
Speaker 0: He didn't have a good.

170
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,550
Speaker 0: He didn't have a high skill at air hockey.

171
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,958
Speaker 0: He had a cheap and clever strategy.

172
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:05,530
Speaker 0: It was sort of like he was sort of like a punch-out boss like soda Popinski.

173
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,633
Speaker 0: He's not dangerous.

174
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:11,610
Speaker 0: once you learn his pattern you can beat him, but his patterns tricky if you don't know it yet.

175
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:13,782
Speaker 1: And it worked on me, and I couldn't believe it.

176
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:18,870
Speaker 0: and I came back and Scott And I trained and trained and once he figured out the pattern he couldn't win anymore.

177
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:20,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, like soda pop in.

178
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:26,480
Speaker 1: since then I mean unless we enter an air hockey tournament Which we there aren't any near us that we have time to enter.

179
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:35,987
Speaker 1: but suffice to say gonna long story short Dave and Joel I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is because you have already said that you believe this is a game of chance.

180
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,462
Speaker 1: Therefore you have odds of winning what I'm about to put forth.

181
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:57,097
Speaker 1: you see if either of you can beat Either of us at any two out of three match of air hockey now Unlimited tries for the rest of your lives as long as you can find us and we can play a game We'll give you a hundred dollars.

182
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,726
Speaker 0: It has to be a real air hockey table.

183
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:03,296
Speaker 0: It can't be one of those $50 tables from like Walmart.

184
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,945
Speaker 1: gotta be a photon or photon equivalent tournament regulation.

185
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:16,069
Speaker 0: yet for anyone who doesn't know there is I Consider there to be only one legitimate manufacturer of playable air hockey tables and that manufacturer is Valley Dynamo.

186
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:22,850
Speaker 1: now There are other air hockey tables that we would accept for the purposes this challenge Just because it might not always be easy to find a photon table.

187
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,444
Speaker 0: Yes, well Valley Dynamo makes other air hockey tables besides the photon.

188
00:12:27,484 --> 00:12:29,590
Speaker 0: the photon just happens to be my table of choice.

189
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:43,897
Speaker 0: But any air hockey any at least a seven foot long arcade style air hockey table that is full-size that is manufactured by Valley Dynamo and is in Good enough working order will count.

190
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:54,518
Speaker 1: so thus if either one of you can be either one of us It'll be $50 if you can beat me and $50 if you can beat Scott now Anytime you play against us.

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,150
Speaker 1: if we win you lose nothing.

192
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,559
Speaker 1: There is no stake of failure.

193
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,109
Speaker 1: if you win however you get the money.

194
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:03,856
Speaker 1: now There are two ways to go with this.

195
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,383
Speaker 0: you can only win the money once.

196
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:07,936
Speaker 0: you can't beat us again and again and again To take all our money.

197
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,488
Speaker 1: granted not that I'm too worried about.

198
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:17,970
Speaker 1: no Now I thought hey if we put this challenge out What if they decide to train and practice and become really good and you know what that?

199
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,346
Speaker 1: Proves my argument right because that meant that you had to train to beat me.

200
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:29,430
Speaker 1: that meant that you Answered your own question, and you said to yourself Dave I am NOT good enough to beat rim or Scott.

201
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:33,868
Speaker 1: Therefore I am going to train and add to my skill in order to beat them.

202
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:39,170
Speaker 1: therefore It is not a game of chance and therefore I win regardless of having to give you money.

203
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:44,368
Speaker 0: So basically we pay you to have you be shameful of your previous statement.

204
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,080
Speaker 1: of course I also just want to play air hockey against you.

205
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,010
Speaker 1: to prove you in horrible fashion.

206
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,530
Speaker 1: I mean people have watched us play air hockey against each other and the matches last 10 to 15 minutes sometimes because it's just nuts.

207
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:58,321
Speaker 1: But watching us play against anyone else.

208
00:13:58,823 --> 00:13:59,606
Speaker 1: We'll do what.

209
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,490
Speaker 1: we're kind of assholes.

210
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:03,183
Speaker 1: We'll do things like not gonna score not gonna score.

211
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:12,270
Speaker 0: I'm gonna score right now bing Yeah, I played against a lot of people who can't shoot the puck straight into the goal from their side of the table.

212
00:14:12,715 --> 00:14:27,898
Speaker 0: So I'll just you know I'll just be like uh and I'll take my hands up in the air and they can't put it in the puck in the goal And then I'll stop the puck and then they'll hold their disc right in front of their goal And I'll be like bounce it off the side in the goal And be like uh how'd that happen?

213
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:31,210
Speaker 1: never mind my special move which I actually overuse against Scott.

214
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,842
Speaker 1: He can block it readily, but no one else can block my special.

215
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:35,570
Speaker 0: where you reach out across the table.

216
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:38,481
Speaker 1: Oh, not that the one where I hit the side and put that English on it.

217
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,789
Speaker 0: whatever that fucker whatever.

218
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,822
Speaker 1: now We'll play whatever style you want clap or no clap.

219
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:45,048
Speaker 1: No it doesn't matter.

220
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:50,050
Speaker 0: yep Yep, any style of air hockey playing you want you can make up the rules as well.

221
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,291
Speaker 0: You know.

222
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:53,910
Speaker 0: of course the table rules is that you know seven goals usually wins.

223
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got to be some sort of legitimate air hockey some sort of photon table.

224
00:14:59,352 --> 00:14:59,693
Speaker 1: I don't know.

225
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:00,757
Speaker 1: clap or no clap.

226
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:07,560
Speaker 1: clap by the way is where you pick up the paddle and drop it on the puck Which is illegal in most tournaments, but it's okay in the Midwest.

227
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

228
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:13,622
Speaker 0: I think it's enough about air hockey Yeah, but yeah anyone else out there who thinks they're good at air hockey.

229
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:17,980
Speaker 0: You should meet us and play air hockey Yeah, we'll play a game air hockey with you.

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,730
Speaker 1: in fact if anyone challenges us to air hockey We'll always pay for the game just to humiliate you, but then once you lose you have to start paying to try again.

231
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, unless we really cuz sometimes there's no one to play air hockey with.

232
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:32,268
Speaker 1: sometimes partly cuz no one will play against us.

233
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:32,790
Speaker 0: all right.

234
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,703
Speaker 0: So news all right.

235
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:35,730
Speaker 1: I got a quick news.

236
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:46,038
Speaker 1: Among the virtual console games to have come out on the Wii this week Special mention has to go out to super ghoul go Ghosts and goblins ghouls and ghosts ghouls and ghosts.

237
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:48,165
Speaker 0: right I think it's super ghouls and ghosts.

238
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:49,770
Speaker 1: it was ghosts and goblins on the NES.

239
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,918
Speaker 0: Yep, and the super it's super ghouls and ghosts.

240
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:52,561
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

241
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,930
Speaker 1: I just want to say fuck that game.

242
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:59,965
Speaker 0: Well the thing is ghosts and goblins for the NES is one of the hardest games ever.

243
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:03,597
Speaker 1: yeah grant need it wasn't Unexpectedly hard for the era.

244
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:06,250
Speaker 1: I mean I knew exactly what I was getting into when I bought that game.

245
00:16:06,873 --> 00:16:12,037
Speaker 0: It wasn't silver surfer hard, but it was pretty close to silver surfer hard, but yet I knew people who could beat it.

246
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:24,049
Speaker 0: yep super ghouls and ghosts for the SNES I think was a better game because I played both of them and while it was also stupidly hard I could get farther in the Super Nintendo game than I could in the NES.

247
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:28,510
Speaker 1: well You see I got all the way to the end one day, and there was no game facts back.

248
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,299
Speaker 1: Then I didn't other than a Nintendo power.

249
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,686
Speaker 1: I didn't really know much about the games.

250
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:42,098
Speaker 1: I was just playing through it I was getting good at it And then I get to world seven or whatever near the end and Princess basically says oh by the way Here's a magic necklace now.

251
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,950
Speaker 1: You got to go beat the whole game again before you can fight the actual boss.

252
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:50,669
Speaker 1: Oh, and by the way the games twice as hard now, and I said what I've never even gotten past like level two.

253
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:54,365
Speaker 1: I sold the game back to funko land that day.

254
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:55,329
Speaker 1: I was so pissed.

255
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:57,395
Speaker 1: All right granted.

256
00:16:57,676 --> 00:17:06,472
Speaker 1: I kind of regretted that later because I realized that I still wanted to beat the game But it was too late, but that moment of anger sealed the game's fate and to this day I've never beaten it.

257
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:11,348
Speaker 0: so do you think who do you think should buy this game on the virtual console if you like?

258
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:29,830
Speaker 0: really hard old-school platformer shooters Okay, and when I say really I mean really really yeah, really, but sex Okay, so I think I did this as news before when they first announced it, but now it is happening.

259
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:30,832
Speaker 0: Counter.

260
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:43,190
Speaker 0: you might know if you are a player of steam half-life mods of the game called counter-strike the most popular Online shooting game the game that for a long time single-handedly dominated the online gaming world.

261
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:47,705
Speaker 0: Well, there are two versions of counter-strike that you can play at the moment.

262
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:59,910
Speaker 0: there is counter-strike 1.6 Which is a half-life 1 game and counter-strike source, which is a half-life 2 game even though they're pretty similar But also different in ways not noticeable by normal people, but very noticeable to gamers.

263
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:06,428
Speaker 1: Yes, in fact a lot of people who have the capacity to play the newer version play the old one because they prefer it.

264
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:17,869
Speaker 0: well I announced a long time ago on the podcast the news about them adding Advertisements to the old counter-strike, so you know a means to make money off of something which has always been free.

265
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,256
Speaker 0: Alrighty well guess what.

266
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:26,926
Speaker 0: now there's pretty much gonna be ads in it But only on two maps on dust 2 and Aztec.

267
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:27,770
Speaker 0: there will be ads.

268
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,114
Speaker 1: I just wait in the.

269
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,550
Speaker 0: in the non steam version the old game the old the steam one has no ads.

270
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,442
Speaker 0: It's the old one that has ads so only in those two maps.

271
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:37,104
Speaker 0: Yep.

272
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:39,313
Speaker 1: Just don't run those maps I know.

273
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,199
Speaker 1: or run modified versions of those maps.

274
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,262
Speaker 1: run the old BSP.

275
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,105
Speaker 0: I got.

276
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,650
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can do that anymore.

277
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,302
Speaker 0: I think they have the vac what?

278
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:47,270
Speaker 0: I don't know how the shit works.

279
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,889
Speaker 0: But maybe you could run modified versions of the maps.

280
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:53,988
Speaker 1: The only reason you couldn't run one is if other people connecting to you didn't have it.

281
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,118
Speaker 0: yeah I guess instead of auto download.

282
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,650
Speaker 1: There's there's no way that could work unless they broke counter-strike.

283
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:02,195
Speaker 0: I have no idea how it works But they've got it.

284
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:04,022
Speaker 0: and it used to be that.

285
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:04,363
Speaker 0: you know.

286
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:08,400
Speaker 0: some people would go into the beta test You know to get the ads the you know what.

287
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,866
Speaker 0: I don't know why you would do that beta.

288
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:14,460
Speaker 0: test the ads but Now it's not beta anymore and everyone sees the ads.

289
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,210
Speaker 0: but all the ads are for other valve stuff.

290
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:22,506
Speaker 0: They don't have any ads for other things yet, so you'll be walking around Aztec, and you'll see like you know.

291
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:23,489
Speaker 0: buy half-life 2 today.

292
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:26,918
Speaker 0: Please buy half-life 2 episode 1.

293
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:27,701
Speaker 1: see the thing is.

294
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:35,689
Speaker 1: the only reason this is even issue is because the way Counter-strike is set up it can't be played without their stupid authentication stuff.

295
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:48,918
Speaker 1: so if like quake 2 to this day you can still play quake 2 online and there are a Call them they don't have to do anything.

296
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz there's no reason.

297
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:51,470
Speaker 0: if I want they could turn on server.

298
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:54,999
Speaker 1: I just run one and it just works And yep will know my IP address.

299
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,670
Speaker 1: they can connect to it and play quake 2 with me.

300
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:03,950
Speaker 0: Yep John Carmack could turn off every computer he and in software owns and you could still play quake 2 with your friends on the internet.

301
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:09,690
Speaker 1: But valve was so worried about piracy and probably about protecting their various revenues and cheating.

302
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:16,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, that you can't play counter-strike without crazy hacking or using their authentication servers.

303
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:17,850
Speaker 1: Yep, in fact they threat.

304
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:24,970
Speaker 1: They didn't really threaten openly But they hinted many times in the past at shutting down the old wand servers to force people to play the new counter-strike.

305
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically.

306
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:37,430
Speaker 0: I don't know there are good things about you know them having some sort of centralized Authentication tracking mechanism for all these games, but there's also bad things about it.

307
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:41,170
Speaker 0: And one of the bad things is now you might see some ads.

308
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:44,490
Speaker 1: See the thing is I'd care more if I still played counter-strike.

309
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:50,905
Speaker 1: I would still but at the same time the only reason I don't play counter-strike is that I no longer have a computer capable of doing so.

310
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:56,870
Speaker 0: Yep, well now even if you had a computer capable of doing so you wouldn't play counter-strike 1.6.

311
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,287
Speaker 0: You'd probably stick to counter-strike source or whatever.

312
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:02,824
Speaker 1: no I'd probably still play 1.6 and avoid the ads somehow cuz.

313
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:08,469
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah But hopefully when Team Fortress 2 comes out they will not have ads in it.

314
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:13,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to those days because I am buying a new computer specifically for PC gaming.

315
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:20,187
Speaker 1: I'm jumping back in I'm gonna buy all those games like Civ 4, and I'm gonna play him And I'm gonna talk about him.

316
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:24,270
Speaker 0: I am also going to buy all those games cuz pretty much.

317
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:27,761
Speaker 1: I've missed almost two eras of PC gaming now.

318
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:28,583
Speaker 0: You haven't missed much.

319
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:29,145
Speaker 1: No.

320
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:30,008
Speaker 1: I really haven't.

321
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:30,610
Speaker 1: that's why I'm not.

322
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:39,044
Speaker 0: I mean this is one of the best years that's gonna happen ever because we've got three valve games coming out And we've got port um not well portals one of the three valve games.

323
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,108
Speaker 0: I haven't for spore.

324
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:45,668
Speaker 1: I haven't been this excited about the PC game lineup since quake 2 was announced.

325
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,915
Speaker 0: um Maybe that's true.

326
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:52,190
Speaker 1: Well the era when quake 2 and all those games were coming out, okay?

327
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:58,121
Speaker 1: I haven't been this excited since the 90s I mean, I think tribes 2 was the last time I was excited about a PC game.

328
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:02,197
Speaker 0: until now okay, so yeah since 2000 I haven't been excited.

329
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:03,666
Speaker 1: That was a long time ago.

330
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,897
Speaker 0: in 2000 I was still playing with a seven.

331
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:16,050
Speaker 0: there's been a seven year drought of PC gaming things of the day.

332
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:32,082
Speaker 1: So this is a video of someone analyzing with examples and video and Everything almost every aspect of super dodgeball for the original nes that you could possibly Understand know or care about while playing that game.

333
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,310
Speaker 0: I mean it also if you watch him play.

334
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,591
Speaker 0: It's.

335
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:37,139
Speaker 0: it's basically a human controlled speed run.

336
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:40,509
Speaker 0: I mean he beats the game about as fast as he can possibly be beaten.

337
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:44,710
Speaker 0: I Don't see anyone doing it any more efficiently or any faster.

338
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:47,530
Speaker 1: I mean granted the stuff he talks about is really interesting.

339
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:56,787
Speaker 1: But if you read the instruction book to the game Which was actually pretty thick or if you ever looked at game facts, or if you actually played the game enough It's nothing new.

340
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:08,847
Speaker 1: But if you're one of those people who just always sucked at this game because the game isn't So intuitive especially if you didn't have the manual a lot of people never figured out how to throw those Ground attacks as opposed to the air attacks or things like that.

341
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:21,450
Speaker 0: yeah I think one thing about this game is that while you can get all the information You know that he says it's hard to understand what that information actually means in terms of the actual gameplay.

342
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:29,785
Speaker 0: So when he says it and he shows you video of what he's talking about at the same time it really helps you get a complete Understanding of this game in about five minutes.

343
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:35,129
Speaker 1: yes I was also very pleased that he chooses the same loadout that I choose when I'm playing the single-player game.

344
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:36,835
Speaker 1: The same reasons.

345
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:44,070
Speaker 1: he even says I don't pick John because while his endurance is awesome I don't need that because I don't fail to catch the ball.

346
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,373
Speaker 0: Yep, that is.

347
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:55,144
Speaker 0: one problem with that game is that you know there are these stats to make one team better than another but Humans can catch the ball no matter what player they're using or anything.

348
00:23:55,325 --> 00:24:01,270
Speaker 1: so it's like yeah I mean my brother And I got really good at this game as kids and it would literally come down to where we were playing.

349
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:09,761
Speaker 1: No amount of playing would ever cause one of us to win and the game would last over an hour Until one of us got tired or just made a mistake.

350
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:20,560
Speaker 0: If I had made that game the one thing I would have done differently to mix it up is I would have had you know the stats so that certain players Like one guy is really good at catching.

351
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,674
Speaker 0: so even if you push the button a little late or early He'll still catch it.

352
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:26,990
Speaker 0: that would have been one and some other players would be not so good at catching.

353
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,729
Speaker 0: So if you had anything less than perfect timing they would be hit.

354
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:34,970
Speaker 0: Another thing I would have done is certain players would assert would have had sort of a catch endurance.

355
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:42,510
Speaker 0: It's like if they just caught the ball recently like twice and if they try to catch it on the next throw It's gonna be a lot harder almost impossible.

356
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,398
Speaker 0: so you have to have someone else catch it.

357
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:55,048
Speaker 1: that way you have to made cat automate a stamina stat and Basically when you get hit by anything stamina goes down and comes up slowly And you only take real damage when the stamina is zero.

358
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:56,694
Speaker 0: That's pretty new.

359
00:24:56,854 --> 00:25:00,364
Speaker 1: catches drop stamina, but not as much as being hit.

360
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:02,690
Speaker 1: or maybe I got a bunch of ideas.

361
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:15,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what we can both agree on is that super dodgeball is an old NES game that needs a modern remake Yes Cuz it was that in River City ransom are some of my favorite games ever pretty much every game made by What was those companies?

362
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:15,857
Speaker 0: I forget.

363
00:25:15,877 --> 00:25:18,249
Speaker 1: and regardless all those games are awesome.

364
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:23,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the games that look like that you all know what those games are the soccer one and the the other one.

365
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah the other one I forget anyway.

366
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:34,930
Speaker 0: So if you thought that going to the movies and seeing ads before the movie was bad now well it used to be worse.

367
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:37,482
Speaker 1: They're lucky that this was about something.

368
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:51,470
Speaker 0: I have great nostalgia for yeah, so Back in the day Atari when they were still the company that made the Atari 2600 and all that other shit They put out an ad for a video game.

369
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,050
Speaker 0: They were making an arcade video game, and they put that ad in the movie theaters.

370
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:57,782
Speaker 0: It was like a pretty long ad.

371
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:58,970
Speaker 0: it was a few minutes long.

372
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:10,169
Speaker 0: It was produced on film and if you went to see a movie you see this ad before I presume Before the movie or maybe during the intermission which they don't have anymore or something like that.

373
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:13,810
Speaker 1: You know I've never been to a film that had an intermission except Hamlet.

374
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,009
Speaker 0: I did when I was a kid.

375
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:20,470
Speaker 0: We would go to the movies and like three like the first three times I ever went to the movies they had intermission.

376
00:26:20,892 --> 00:26:28,680
Speaker 0: Even when I was a little kid there was no intermission like a real little kid like three like I wanted to see the Sesame Street movie and those intermission wow yep all the old.

377
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,883
Speaker 0: also the Care Bears movie.

378
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:35,721
Speaker 1: wow there wasn't an intermission at the Care Bears movie I remember clearly maybe I'm pretty sure it was the Care Bears movie.

379
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:38,289
Speaker 1: what there was however was the cartoon before the movie.

380
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:41,255
Speaker 0: oh Always a cartoon before the movie.

381
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:43,622
Speaker 0: anything else is unthinkable however.

382
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,349
Speaker 1: I got to say this this Dig Dug ad.

383
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,918
Speaker 0: oh Yeah, it's an ad for Dig Dug.

384
00:26:47,998 --> 00:26:49,366
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess you didn't say that yet.

385
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:52,441
Speaker 1: That's fine It's pretty bad and not like the Power Glove.

386
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:54,610
Speaker 0: No it's it's real bad.

387
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:59,250
Speaker 0: I mean I like Dig Dug a lot, but this this is not Dig Dug.

388
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:06,622
Speaker 1: I'm really see a lot of ads from that era are a lot like this And I don't understand them.

389
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:08,250
Speaker 1: even then I didn't understand them.

390
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,925
Speaker 1: They just don't seem like they're actually selling the product.

391
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,397
Speaker 0: well in the end They didn't really sell the product.

392
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:15,201
Speaker 0: that well did they?

393
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:16,528
Speaker 1: no Atari didn't do so.

394
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:24,876
Speaker 0: well No So I wonder if it was because they spent a lot of money on shitty movie theater ads that made Dig Dug look bad Instead of good.

395
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:27,310
Speaker 0: Yes, Dig Dug is awesome super awesome.

396
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:35,247
Speaker 1: I just can't imagine being a human being and seeing that in the theater before a movie especially back Then when there really weren't so many ads before movies.

397
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,223
Speaker 0: well I had an ad before my movie a Dig Dug ad.

398
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:39,410
Speaker 0: it was the style of the time.

399
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:49,770
Speaker 1: So we realized well, you know I mean originally I wanted to review XCOM UFO defense Which is in my opinion one of the greatest video or games ever made.

400
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,447
Speaker 0: XCOM UFO defense is a great game.

401
00:27:52,508 --> 00:28:00,708
Speaker 0: however I have not played it that much because well I didn't have it back in the DOS days, and I'm not gonna play it anytime soon.

402
00:28:00,728 --> 00:28:07,329
Speaker 1: yeah for me It was actually the first game that wasn't shareware that I ever got whoa.

403
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:10,375
Speaker 1: However I got it pirated.

404
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:15,250
Speaker 1: whoa just gave it to me on some discs crazy, and they gave me a piece of paper.

405
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:20,110
Speaker 1: They said the codes to start the game are on this piece of paper, and I remember thinking to myself that seems silly.

406
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:21,909
Speaker 1: Why would they do something like that?

407
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,273
Speaker 0: I thought the same.

408
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:23,715
Speaker 0: I didn't.

409
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:24,859
Speaker 1: I had no concept.

410
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:32,508
Speaker 0: you try to play star control - there was this big star chart And they you had to find a star at certain Coordinates in order to get the game to work.

411
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,259
Speaker 1: Quest for glory - is one of the few games that did it right.

412
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:43,789
Speaker 1: the copy protection was a big color map that came with The game and if you wandered off into the city streets good luck finding your way around without that map.

413
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:48,850
Speaker 1: However if you were badass or diligent you probably could find your way around.

414
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:53,769
Speaker 1: Well probably not because there's a really big city and most of its dead ends, but

415
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:07,729
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so seeing as you weren't gonna talk about a game that only one of us knew enough about to do an episode on we tried to think of a game that we had not talked about in the show that we have both played.

416
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:16,102
Speaker 0: and Well we finally came up with the answer Amazingly enough despite it showing up in our archives like six times.

417
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,970
Speaker 0: We never actually talked about Phoenix, right?

418
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:21,643
Speaker 1: Oh, we talked about it.

419
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:22,729
Speaker 1: We just didn't review it.

420
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,583
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so let's do that.

421
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:26,910
Speaker 1: so Phoenix, right?

422
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:32,369
Speaker 1: I'm sure many of you are aware of it But very briefly for people who haven't actually played it Phoenix, right?

423
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,890
Speaker 1: Known in Japan is Gakuten Saiban is a game about lawyers.

424
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:39,370
Speaker 1: You're a defense attorney named Phoenix, right?

425
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:45,410
Speaker 1: And you defend people who are always innocent against evil prosecutors who are always evil.

426
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:47,395
Speaker 0: Now you're.

427
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:53,072
Speaker 0: the game is called Gakuten Saiban in Japan because that means turn about courtroom Which is?

428
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:55,039
Speaker 0: that's basically what the game is about.

429
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:00,421
Speaker 0: you have these court cases and at some point in the case Everything turns about.

430
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:17,769
Speaker 0: sometimes it turns about a lot Sometimes it turns about a little but every case looks like it's going in one direction one direction one direction And then sometime near the end of the case right before you solve it everything you think is wrong and the whole thing gets turned on its head and the answer becomes apparent.

431
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:26,480
Speaker 1: and Hooray now depending on how smart you are you might figure out what the turnout is gonna be before it happens in which case it Feel like there's much of a turnabout at all.

432
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,210
Speaker 0: It just kind of feels like you figured it out.

433
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:32,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, the second game hasn't been doing it for me in that regard yet But I don't know.

434
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:35,048
Speaker 1: maybe cuz I haven't been playing it in one straight shot like I did the first game.

435
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:41,612
Speaker 0: Yep Well in Japan, there are three GBA games, I think they're all GBA games I don't know.

436
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:46,870
Speaker 0: and there was a fourth one that is coming soon or is about to be out?

437
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:49,116
Speaker 1: I'm not sure way to have the information.

438
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:53,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's basically each one has four episodes in it.

439
00:30:54,231 --> 00:31:01,724
Speaker 0: So there are 12 episodes in the whole series and as soon as the fourth game comes out presumably There will be 16 episodes.

440
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:07,788
Speaker 0: now in the US They gave us the first GBA game as a DS game.

441
00:31:07,808 --> 00:31:11,918
Speaker 0: in addition They added a rant of fifth episode to it.

442
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:25,335
Speaker 0: the fifth episode in the first Phoenix Wright in the US was not in Phoenix Wright 1 and the GBA in Japan and that's pretty obvious once you play that episode that it has nothing to do With the first four episodes.

443
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:30,213
Speaker 1: Well also considering that it uses the DS straight up and there was no way you could have done that On a GBA.

444
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:37,470
Speaker 0: Yep, all the other episodes except for episode 5 and the first Phoenix Wright Don't actually use any special DS features.

445
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:46,390
Speaker 0: All they do is let you play this otherwise GBA game with the DS stylus Which actually makes the game a lot more awesome and easier to play.

446
00:31:46,852 --> 00:31:51,930
Speaker 0: But that wasn't the way the game originally was and it's not necessary, but it makes the game fun.

447
00:31:52,030 --> 00:32:00,950
Speaker 1: I like it now the DS one that the the one that actually uses the DS at the end of the first cartridge is Basically an entire game in and of itself.

448
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:06,108
Speaker 1: It's so long and good that they probably could have sold it as a separate game And I would have paid the same amount of money.

449
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:11,970
Speaker 0: Yeah as I mean each game has four episodes, but the episodes get longer and better.

450
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:21,010
Speaker 0: It's like the first episode on any one of these is short and kind of simple and it's not really worth anything And the second one is kind of moderate like okay.

451
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:29,759
Speaker 0: Then the third one is like a real-deal episode and the fourth one is always some incredible crazy Climax episode that's really long.

452
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,470
Speaker 0: It's probably multiple days of trials and Of one trial and crazy things happen usually involving the plot.

453
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:48,810
Speaker 0: You know though what they tend to do is each trial each of the episodes in any particular instance of the game Will be separate, you know, this is a story of this killing that killing some other killing.

454
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:54,062
Speaker 0: They're unrelated But there will be this sort of background plot that is in the first few.

455
00:32:54,102 --> 00:33:01,569
Speaker 0: at first three episodes like something else is going on Mmm, and then in the fourth episode they'll deal with that and it's like whoa.

456
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,262
Speaker 0: They're dealing with the plot that they've been alluding to the whole time.

457
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:05,870
Speaker 0: Holy crap had that happen.

458
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:10,670
Speaker 1: Now the game itself every bit basically gets broken up into one of two types.

459
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:18,070
Speaker 1: You're either collecting evidence and interviewing people or you're in the courtroom and they're both kind of equally awesome in different ways.

460
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:24,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really sometimes feels a lot more like a detective kind of Carmen San Diego game.

461
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:25,770
Speaker 0: then it feels like a lawyer game.

462
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:35,910
Speaker 1: yeah, definitely has CSI syndrome where you're a defense attorney and You're the detective and you're the forensics guy even though there's a detective and a forensics guy, but they don't do much.

463
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:42,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the the justice system within which you are working in Phoenix Wright is insane.

464
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:53,030
Speaker 1: effectively prosecutors exist to get a guilty verdict regardless of whether or not someone's actually guilty and The judge will just say guilty at the drop of a hat.

465
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the prosecutor will say something like.

466
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:03,250
Speaker 1: I can't think of anyone else who could have done this crime Therefore guilty and the judges say I don't see anything wrong with that argument.

467
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:09,290
Speaker 0: And then as you as the defense attorney if you don't open your mouth, it's just guilty right there and then you got nothing.

468
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,710
Speaker 0: You see you got to keep saying stuff to prevent the guilty verdict.

469
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:19,309
Speaker 0: It's like guilty until proven innocent, which is why that's not how our court system works because it would be very bad.

470
00:34:19,893 --> 00:34:29,889
Speaker 1: yep, also the detective the police officers involved Basically work for the prosecution and their job is to make sure the prosecution gets a guilty verdict.

471
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:36,301
Speaker 0: It really sucks for the defense attorney especially since most of the time your clients are innocent.

472
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:41,724
Speaker 0: or else what would be the point of having you play a game as a Defense attorney with guilty as client?

473
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:42,710
Speaker 1: that could have been really cool.

474
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:46,262
Speaker 1: If you've got a client and you're trying to defend him and they're in the end.

475
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:48,389
Speaker 1: They are guilty and oh shit.

476
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,253
Speaker 0: So that would be crazy.

477
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:51,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if you got him off anyway.

478
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:52,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

479
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:52,143
Speaker 0: Yeah.

480
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:53,956
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah.

481
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:55,853
Speaker 1: Now the game.

482
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:56,998
Speaker 1: I mean the two parts the.

483
00:34:57,419 --> 00:35:08,250
Speaker 1: the way the game works is basically dialogue boxes with text characters in front of you talking Evidence areas where you poke around and look for stuff and then the courtroom which is a whole separate thing.

484
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:15,270
Speaker 1: So you run into a person and they'll be you know Like one two or three or whatever number of things you can ask them about and they'll give you interesting answers.

485
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,540
Speaker 1: Sometimes things you ask them will open up more things you can ask about.

486
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:21,770
Speaker 1: sometimes things they say will become evidence you can use later.

487
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,190
Speaker 0: Yep, the other thing is you have this like bucket of evidence.

488
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:31,761
Speaker 0: You can look at the evidence at any time you can read about it you know you can collect more of it and you can show it to people.

489
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:37,766
Speaker 0: and that always gets pretty fun because you'll walk up to someone and you'd be like alright and you'll show them every piece of evidence.

490
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:43,210
Speaker 0: and Sometimes you have to show them a piece of evidence to get them to say something that you need to continue with the game.

491
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:50,150
Speaker 0: But sometimes you'll just show them something and they'll say something interesting But most of the time they have a default thing they say which is annoying.

492
00:35:50,651 --> 00:36:01,202
Speaker 1: Yep, that definitely seems to be the primary punishment mechanism of the evidence-gathering thing that anything you do that is wrong Just waste your time and annoys you but it doesn't hurt you.

493
00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:03,870
Speaker 0: It's really hard to lose at Phoenix, right?

494
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,369
Speaker 0: It's possible but hard.

495
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:12,790
Speaker 1: I lost once because I wasn't really paying attention and I think it was the fourth one of the first game and I wasn't paying attention.

496
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,873
Speaker 1: So I used up a bunch of my strikes early on and then I got to an actually hard part and I had one strike Left.

497
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:22,873
Speaker 0: I was like, ah, ah Basically you have this sort of in the first.

498
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:35,129
Speaker 0: in the first Phoenix right in the US you have these strikes and every time you screw up in court like If the judge says show me the piece of evidence that proves X and you show the wrong one You get a strike and then you have to try again.

499
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,862
Speaker 0: If you get too many strikes, it's guilty and you lose.

500
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:39,710
Speaker 0: in the second Phoenix, right?

501
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:48,928
Speaker 0: You have this health meter and whenever you screw up depending on what you screw up like a little screw up It'll go down a little bit and a big screw up and it'll go down a lot.

502
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:55,490
Speaker 0: But then they added in this feature for the second Phoenix right game in the US called the psych lock.

503
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:56,598
Speaker 1: these are really cool.

504
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,665
Speaker 1: say you're talking to someone and Suddenly they get all defensive about something without spoiling how you get it.

505
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:08,130
Speaker 1: You have a psychic power Wherein you can see people's innermost secrets.

506
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:13,370
Speaker 1: So if someone's hiding something suddenly you'll see them surrounded by chains with locks on them.

507
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:23,347
Speaker 0: It's actually sort of scary when it happens, but what you have to do is You can attempt to break those locks and get them to tell their secret to you.

508
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:31,070
Speaker 0: to do it You have to go and find the quote keys to the locks, which are usually pieces of evidence or facts.

509
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:34,602
Speaker 0: So when you tell you know, you'll start pressing them on the issue you'd be like.

510
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,810
Speaker 0: so this secret you've got blah.

511
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:38,804
Speaker 0: They'll be like, I don't know nothing you like.

512
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:41,491
Speaker 0: Well, look at this All right, all right like

513
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:44,140
Speaker 1: I don't know Joey Jojo Shabbat when you say is a picture

514
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,923
Speaker 0: of you kissing him

515
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:52,263
Speaker 1: and then they go and one of the locks breaks then like You can't prove that's a picture of me and then you prove it's a picture that

516
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,175
Speaker 0: on the back is their signature and like a love Note or something?

517
00:37:55,195 --> 00:38:00,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when you break all the locks they break down They usually cry or something and then they tell you what they were hiding from you.

518
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:06,229
Speaker 0: Yet the other cool thing is when you break the psych lock your health meter fills back up.

519
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:13,030
Speaker 1: But at the same time if you make mistakes breaking psych locks you take psychic damage and you can get close to dying.

520
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:15,435
Speaker 0: Yeah so it actually the.

521
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:22,070
Speaker 0: the mechanic of psych locks in the game kind of makes it nice because usually Investigate in between days of the trial.

522
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:28,050
Speaker 0: So if you suck one day at the trial you can make up for it by breaking the psych locks without screwing up.

523
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:33,970
Speaker 1: It also adds an interesting element to the evidence gathering because in the first game the evidence gathering you couldn't lose there.

524
00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:39,370
Speaker 1: It wasn't a matter of screwing up It was just a matter of figuring out how to get all the evidence to make the day progress.

525
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:41,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, now you can get stuck.

526
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,210
Speaker 1: You have to worry you have to make decisions that might hurt you.

527
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:52,110
Speaker 0: I mean really when you look at the game It's just sort of telling you this story and you have to figure out what buttons to push to get the story to continue.

528
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,535
Speaker 1: It's more a puzzle game.

529
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:56,384
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's basically you're solving logical puzzles.

530
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:57,929
Speaker 0: Like alright, what do I have to do?

531
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,115
Speaker 0: You know to get this to happen?

532
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:06,014
Speaker 0: because that person is doing X and that person's doing Y and that person said this and I Have these items.

533
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:07,119
Speaker 0: What does this mean?

534
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:07,802
Speaker 0: Aha.

535
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:08,787
Speaker 0: Let me try to do this.

536
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,530
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

537
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,810
Speaker 0: Oh look now it's getting me further along in the game and eventually you get to the end of the game.

538
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:16,530
Speaker 1: Yep, a lot of the trial the trial sequence is really interesting.

539
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:23,952
Speaker 1: They often boil down to things like the prosecution will say something and then you'll want like it'll cut to Phoenix and he'll think to Himself.

540
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:27,985
Speaker 1: so is this worth pursuing or should I let it drop and you have to decide?

541
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:34,970
Speaker 1: and if you decide to pursue it But it actually wasn't worth it You'll back yourself into a corner or lose some health or get penalized or whatever.

542
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:39,670
Speaker 0: Sometimes the game will trick you and pull you into loops like in the first Phoenix, right?

543
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,116
Speaker 0: I noticed most of the time.

544
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:43,768
Speaker 0: if you made the wrong decision, it would just be like you're stupid.

545
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:44,270
Speaker 0: Try again.

546
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:47,329
Speaker 0: You just choose the other answer and the second Phoenix, right?

547
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,504
Speaker 1: They like say you bluff you don't know and it's like should I press further?

548
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:55,910
Speaker 1: and you're like, yeah, this is important I'm gonna press it'll let you keep pressing.

549
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:59,370
Speaker 1: So then the judge will be like, alright show me the evidence that this is important.

550
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:01,507
Speaker 1: and now it gives you the evidence thing and you're like, ah

551
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:15,981
Speaker 0: And you try to you choose different pieces of evidence and they're all wrong because it was a trap and you actually should have said No, but if you'd say yes, and you don't realize that you were stupid You're just gonna keep presenting evidence till you're blue in the face and you die.

552
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:18,970
Speaker 1: So don't think that this is a lawyer game.

553
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,916
Speaker 1: It is actually a puzzle game.

554
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:25,330
Speaker 0: if you like Carmen Sandiego with plot then you'll like Phoenix, right?

555
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:41,375
Speaker 0: And if you want to learn a lot about something that isn't real as opposed to learning geography Yeah, well what's good about Phoenix, right that I think it makes it so super popular is that it is not a faithful Translation from the Japanese.

556
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:51,366
Speaker 0: I've looked and I've seen what the Japanese ones are about and the American ones are close But they're not nearly as close as 90% of the anime and manga that we watch

557
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:59,964
Speaker 1: partly because the humor is Often very distinctly Japanese or Whatever and they very much localized these games to a younger American audience,

558
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:01,570
Speaker 0: but they localized them.

559
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,765
Speaker 0: Well, it's like what they brought over here.

560
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:11,039
Speaker 0: is you know The way they translated it and rewrote all the dialogue is not the way it was in Japan But the way it is is good.

561
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,949
Speaker 1: It's kind of this equal but different thing.

562
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:20,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, also it helps that the music is still the same and the character designs are still the same.

563
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,630
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean the game itself is fun and the gameplay would keep me going for a long time.

564
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:26,690
Speaker 1: But what really makes this game shine?

565
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:37,006
Speaker 1: Aside from the fact that the stories are actually pretty good and the jokes while sometimes horrible and punny are still funny Sometimes but even when they're bad, it's bad in this.

566
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,586
Speaker 1: Ah Kind of way as opposed to this kind of way.

567
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:41,210
Speaker 0: That's true.

568
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,399
Speaker 1: But what makes the game shine is the characters.

569
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:54,290
Speaker 1: and if you want to encapsulate all that this game actually is That graphic on the front of Phoenix standing there with that finger in the air pointing it as hard as he can.

570
00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:02,970
Speaker 1: Yep, this game is all about style characters yelling dramatic soap opera action intricate love triangles.

571
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:07,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you like choose your own adventure books, you're probably like Phoenix, right?

572
00:42:07,463 --> 00:42:07,804
Speaker 1: Yes.

573
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:09,490
Speaker 1: Also, I mean Phoenix, right?

574
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,697
Speaker 1: I think would make a fantastic anime.

575
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:14,666
Speaker 0: I think there's a manga coming out at least in Japanese.

576
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:15,730
Speaker 1: I want an anime.

577
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,779
Speaker 0: I don't know if it needs an anime.

578
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,463
Speaker 1: No, it's not a hole.

579
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:19,970
Speaker 1: It doesn't need a 26 episode show.

580
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,916
Speaker 1: It needs like a one episode OAV.

581
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,143
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would definitely work out.

582
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:27,941
Speaker 0: if there's a one up or maybe a movie I'll move you would maybe be alright.

583
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:29,370
Speaker 1: the movie would have to go a little bit darker.

584
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,117
Speaker 1: So then again the game with you would you move?

585
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:34,150
Speaker 0: you'd have to cover like like three cases or something like that.

586
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:34,933
Speaker 0: I don't know.

587
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:35,757
Speaker 0: It's tough.

588
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,410
Speaker 0: Oh, we didn't talk about exactly how the courtroom works.

589
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:42,099
Speaker 0: The courtroom is actually pretty fun when you're you know Cuz we were talking about your examine.

590
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,222
Speaker 0: you go around looking for evidence When you're actually in the court.

591
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:48,017
Speaker 0: the way it works is They'll just be sort of this.

592
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:50,350
Speaker 0: you don't really control anything and you get you know.

593
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,343
Speaker 0: the judge says stuff the prosecutor says stuff Phoenix says stuff.

594
00:42:53,665 --> 00:42:58,249
Speaker 0: then they'll be a witness and Phoenix will get to cross-examine every witness.

595
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:06,595
Speaker 0: So the witness will first testify and they'll say a bunch of stuff and what they say will be broken up into like Individual sentences.

596
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:18,550
Speaker 1: so you look at each sentence or chunk of sentences and on each one you have an option to press meaning You're gonna push him for more information about whatever they just said or Present evidence meaning I have found a contradiction.

597
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:23,470
Speaker 1: I am going to now enlighten you and push you toward the truth by proving that you were wrong.

598
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:27,503
Speaker 0: So let's say rim is the witness and rim says I don't know.

599
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:29,510
Speaker 0: the body was found at noon.

600
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,264
Speaker 0: The body was a man.

601
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:36,689
Speaker 0: The body there was a wallet on the floor at the time.

602
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:38,538
Speaker 1: So then Scott presses me.

603
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:42,033
Speaker 1: the body was found at noon and I say I looked at my watch You saw that it was noon.

604
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:43,598
Speaker 0: and then I press him on.

605
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:47,873
Speaker 1: the body was a man and I'm like, yeah It was a man.

606
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:54,219
Speaker 1: I saw the short hair and the beard and then you you know, you have the autopsy report So you had present and say haha.

607
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:56,009
Speaker 1: It was actually a woman.

608
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:59,969
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's the kind of stuff you actually will find in the game.

609
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know and sometimes like you'll you'll.

610
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:13,448
Speaker 0: basically the strategy I have in the game is that no matter what anyone says I will press on every single sentence because it doesn't hurt to press on every single say usually you.

611
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:21,990
Speaker 0: there are a couple Specific occasions where the judge will say don't press more than once or twice or I'm gonna get you or stop badgering the witness.

612
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:32,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, if he says that then you you don't want to keep pressing but most of the time 90% of the time you can just press every sentence they say to reveal another sentence of information.

613
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,921
Speaker 0: and You you know, sometimes they'll have to modify their testimony.

614
00:44:37,262 --> 00:44:42,910
Speaker 0: and when they modify their testimony then aha They've added two sentences to the testimony.

615
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:53,423
Speaker 0: I know that those two sentences they've added one of those is wrong and I've got evidence that I have to present on top of Those you know and but you got to press them on those first to make sure.

616
00:44:53,483 --> 00:45:04,974
Speaker 1: and yeah now the game will alternatingly make you feel very smart and very Stupid because sometimes you'll be following along and you'll see where this is going a mile away and you'll have your finger Itching.

617
00:45:05,015 --> 00:45:07,090
Speaker 1: you need to throw that evidence that you've got it down.

618
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:13,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sometimes you'll hit a point where you're sitting there and the judge is like, what's it gonna be Phoenix?

619
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:24,759
Speaker 0: and you're like, ah Yeah, the way the game works is they have the right amount of foreshadowing and plot structure and all that and you get to See the evidence and you get to hear all these things.

620
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:37,349
Speaker 0: people say well before they actually You know, I mean, it's sort of a reading comprehension game in a way and that you read all this stuff during the examination phase and then they question you on it in the court phase.

621
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:41,741
Speaker 0: and After reading all this stuff if you're reading comprehension is really good.

622
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:44,330
Speaker 0: You'll know the whole case beginning to end.

623
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,516
Speaker 0: You'll know what's going on.

624
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:48,230
Speaker 0: The whole story will unfold to you at least most of it.

625
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,260
Speaker 1: You might not get the final turnabout.

626
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:51,748
Speaker 0: You might not get the final one.

627
00:45:51,768 --> 00:46:03,190
Speaker 0: Yeah But what'll happen is because even though you know the whole thing They will ask you specific things for specific evidences along the way and some of those specific ones.

628
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,680
Speaker 0: It's like I don't freaking know which.

629
00:46:04,882 --> 00:46:05,889
Speaker 0: what the hell does that?

630
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,662
Speaker 1: Yeah, like maybe you know that Joey Jojo is the murderer.

631
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:09,869
Speaker 1: you figure that out right away.

632
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:16,446
Speaker 1: But then you're back to into a corner where you got to prove that he's the murderer and you know He's the murderer and you're like this piece of evidence.

633
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:19,062
Speaker 1: the judge is like What about that piece of evidence?

634
00:46:19,082 --> 00:46:20,370
Speaker 1: then it cuts to the evidence now?

635
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:23,744
Speaker 1: Pick what part of the evidence is actually gonna prove it.

636
00:46:24,146 --> 00:46:28,617
Speaker 1: that really sucks Yeah, but at the same time it's awesome Like that's where the game really shines.

637
00:46:28,658 --> 00:46:28,798
Speaker 1: cuz.

638
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,224
Speaker 1: then the music changes.

639
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:33,269
Speaker 1: whenever something big is happening You can always tell when you got it, right?

640
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:39,446
Speaker 1: because if you present the proper thing the music will usually stop and then all their music will smell.

641
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:42,778
Speaker 0: you usually hear like Today or you'll like.

642
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:53,998
Speaker 0: the music will change if it's just silent after you Present the evidence or if the music just keeps playing without changing then you've probably got it wrong and the music and the energy There's like this vibe.

643
00:46:54,018 --> 00:47:07,697
Speaker 1: the courtroom starts out pretty tense but slow and every case kind of builds and builds and builds to this climax where The last like five minutes of you playing will be objection objection objection back and forth Yelling and screaming and evidence evidence evidence.

644
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:08,018
Speaker 0: Yep.

645
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,503
Speaker 0: The music will get crazy.

646
00:47:09,723 --> 00:47:11,810
Speaker 0: The witnesses will start getting really crazy.

647
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:13,229
Speaker 0: It's pretty fun.

648
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:33,302
Speaker 1: Now also it plays out a little bit like a fighting game in that whenever you get a good dig in against the prosecutor Or witness they show damage like a robot like they'll take a hit or they'll start looking differently the body posture change or they'll like Like you punched him in the face when actually you just showed him a piece of evidence.

649
00:47:33,703 --> 00:47:44,710
Speaker 1: and every single person witness evil prosecutor whatever judge when you Defeat them when you prove them wrong when they have lost they basically have a death animation.

650
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:53,950
Speaker 1: Not gonna ruin them, but they are all hilarious Super hilarious, I mean one guy's head basically explodes.

651
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:55,472
Speaker 0: It's true.

652
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:56,516
Speaker 0: All right.

653
00:47:57,078 --> 00:48:00,730
Speaker 0: So if you have a DS well, if you don't have a DS what's wrong with you?

654
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:02,470
Speaker 0: The DS is like the number one console.

655
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,863
Speaker 1: yeah, I mean, I love the Wii but the DS is still my number one console.

656
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:12,247
Speaker 0: DS is number one right now and Phoenix Wright is probably it might be the number one game for the DS.

657
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:12,729
Speaker 0: I don't know.

658
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:13,030
Speaker 1: I don't know.

659
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,543
Speaker 1: Don't forget Advance Wars DS.

660
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:16,677
Speaker 0: It's true You know regardless.

661
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:18,526
Speaker 0: if you had a DS, you don't got Phoenix right.

662
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:19,130
Speaker 0: something's wrong.

663
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,664
Speaker 1: The Phoenix Wright franchise is easily in the top 10 of DS games right now.

664
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:25,249
Speaker 0: There's no question about it.

665
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:28,610
Speaker 0: So Phoenix Wright one and two in the United States.

666
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,473
Speaker 0: You should get both.

667
00:48:29,714 --> 00:48:34,450
Speaker 0: if you speak Japanese go and get all the GBA in the original games because you speak Japanese.

668
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:35,809
Speaker 0: Why are you buying the American one for?

669
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:41,273
Speaker 1: Avoid reading spoiler sites because crazy things happen You really don't want to ruin.

670
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:56,461
Speaker 0: also avoid like just watching like videos like even watching Phoenix wrongs where you'll see characters that you don't know about yet is sort of a spoiler because part of it like the Goodness of this game is like when a new character appears.

671
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:59,470
Speaker 0: you see because the character designs are all really awesome and hilarious.

672
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:01,562
Speaker 0: It's like whoa a new character.

673
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:02,750
Speaker 0: Whoo is a big deal.

674
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:10,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's one character who appears in the fifth part of the first game and when he appears before he says anything Just the design.

675
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,462
Speaker 1: when you look at him, it's in a shiver up my spine.

676
00:49:13,522 --> 00:49:16,010
Speaker 1: So I I felt something wrong about this person.

677
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:22,210
Speaker 0: yeah, so It's pretty important not to see much of the game before playing it.

678
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,284
Speaker 1: Yeah granted that means I have to be very careful when I'm around our friends.

679
00:49:26,404 --> 00:49:36,047
Speaker 1: I don't Conrad because they Have a thing for this feat these Phoenix Wright games far beyond what you could ever imagine And they know far more about it than any human being should.

680
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:39,460
Speaker 0: yeah I've beaten both games because I pretty much blasted through him.

681
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,450
Speaker 0: rim beat the first one and he's only like halfway through the second.

682
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little over halfway through.

683
00:49:44,156 --> 00:49:46,824
Speaker 0: All right, so don't spoil the end of the second one for him.

684
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, I swear to God I'll make you at your parents lol.

685
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:54,644
Speaker 0: Okay, Phoenix Wright's awesome and got anything else to say.

686
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:55,950
Speaker 1: Uh, no, that's about it.

687
00:49:56,191 --> 00:50:04,341
