1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,458
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday June 20th 2017 I'm rim and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,518 --> 00:00:19,880
Speaker 0: tonight We're talking about a race to the gala race for the galaxy at all its expansions.

3
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:22,378
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:34,153
Speaker 0: so as many of you follow me on Twitter saw I uh, I Encountered something that I have literally never seen happen in my entire life.

5
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,039
Speaker 1: I mean, that's a lot of things.

6
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:47,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of things you haven't seen in your entire life But this is something that I also hadn't seen But it's also know a lot about but apparently didn't know what I didn't know and I learned some more things.

7
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,920
Speaker 0: I won't get into too much detail on the things I learned because I'll do that like on the next Monday's show.

8
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:53,914
Speaker 0: I'll go kind of in depth.

9
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:59,035
Speaker 0: but My computer at work like just rebooted like oh shit.

10
00:00:59,095 --> 00:00:59,818
Speaker 0: I had a problem.

11
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:03,760
Speaker 0: I'm rebooting All right that happens and then there was no boot disk anymore.

12
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:09,980
Speaker 0: Okay, so I assume well this the hard drive must have died or maybe there's a problem.

13
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:10,564
Speaker 0: Yeah happens.

14
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:11,833
Speaker 0: I'm about to go into the BIOS.

15
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:12,840
Speaker 0: long story short.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,480
Speaker 0: No, the SSD that had my windows on it literally caught fire and fucking burned.

17
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:24,298
Speaker 1: So you went to the BIOS and then fire started coming out of the computer.

18
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:24,820
Speaker 0: fire came out.

19
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,265
Speaker 0: It was a combustion.

20
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:30,480
Speaker 1: so you're in you're in the BIOS and then like a fire just came out the side of the computer.

21
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,447
Speaker 0: Well, I have the window and I see I smell.

22
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,655
Speaker 0: I smell a smell like yeah, what's that smell?

23
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:45,788
Speaker 0: I look and sure enough There's just a fire in there basically the SATA connector for power that goes into this Appetop as SD.

24
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:46,874
Speaker 0: We'll get back to the fuck.

25
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,164
Speaker 0: Appetop is My best.

26
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:50,629
Speaker 0: get it just it burned.

27
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,218
Speaker 0: I don't know what else to just it caught fire.

28
00:01:54,342 --> 00:02:02,599
Speaker 0: it melted like a bunch of stuff including like the entire cable connecting in and Yeah, I had to buy a new SSD.

29
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:10,509
Speaker 0: Luckily, I lost maybe I don't know Couple hours worth of work meaning like stuff.

30
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,164
Speaker 0: I happen to have just saved to my desktop because it was throwaway stuff I didn't care about.

31
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:17,339
Speaker 0: my computer is already like completely back to normal because I back stuff up.

32
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,266
Speaker 0: You should also back stuff up.

33
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:26,238
Speaker 0: if you can't recover like immediately from your main hard drive dying Then you're kind of F because this stuff happens.

34
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:30,340
Speaker 0: Many of you probably didn't expect to have to worry about a hard drive literally catching fire.

35
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,427
Speaker 0: And my best guess as to what happened.

36
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:34,490
Speaker 1: Why did you have an epitaph?

37
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:41,079
Speaker 0: So this was a computer that I bought from New egg, but it was a pre-built computer because it was work.

38
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:47,898
Speaker 0: And yeah, the SSD that they put in it was by a brand that Matt Morgan said it best.

39
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,899
Speaker 0: clearly They meant to spell potato and failed at even this.

40
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:58,292
Speaker 0: so this Appetop SSD Probably had a real warranty.

41
00:02:58,774 --> 00:02:59,356
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

42
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:09,313
Speaker 0: I just threw it away right for the best partly because you can buy a 240 gigabyte like crazy good SSD from Samsung 90 bucks.

43
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:16,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, the 850 avo 90 a hundred bucks tops 110 if you buy it like MSRP and you actually pay for shipping.

44
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:24,499
Speaker 0: so on one hand SSDs are actually way more prone to this than spinning discs ever were.

45
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:28,479
Speaker 0: So there is a danger to your computer if you buy crappy SSDs.

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:38,059
Speaker 0: counterpoint there is literally no reason to buy a crappy SSD because the crappiest SSDs save you like 30 bucks.

47
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:42,735
Speaker 0: Just buy the better SSD by the one that won't set on fire Yeah.

48
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:58,892
Speaker 0: so I have a pretty good theory as to why the SSDs seem more prone to this and it comes down to the fact that the barrier to entry to make the shittiest possible Physical spinning disk hard drive is actually really high.

49
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:04,709
Speaker 0: like you need a pretty complicated manufacturing process to build that machine.

50
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:20,298
Speaker 0: because an old hard drive remember is actually insanely Complicated in terms of having this like tiny read head skimming over a disk spinning it up to 10,000 rpm Literally flying over the surface not touching it in a tiny like well manufactured box.

51
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:26,095
Speaker 0: So the crappiest hard drive you could buy in the world was more likely to fail.

52
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,230
Speaker 0: but it also required Significant industrial like stuff.

53
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,580
Speaker 1: well people sold ones that basically didn't work for shit.

54
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:41,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't care, but usually those were Leavings from bigger factories like to manufacture a hard drive was a pretty big deal.

55
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:49,899
Speaker 0: an SSD You can just slap the circuits together and stick a bunch of shitty flash in and you're good to go Mm-hmm, so there are a lot of shitty companies like potato here.

56
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,398
Speaker 0: Who are making?

57
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Speaker 0: Garbage tier SSDs and the barrier to entry is so low that you're gonna start running into problems like this like Some diode or something is just or like the power circuit is just bad.

58
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:07,474
Speaker 0: Cuz you can send up an amp and a half through those SATA connectors.

59
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:08,256
Speaker 0: Mmm.

60
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:09,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was fun.

61
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:16,429
Speaker 0: That's something that's never happened to me before and magic smoke got out Yeah, and no one in the office believed me.

62
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,275
Speaker 0: So I was like guys here.

63
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:19,740
Speaker 0: Look there was a fire.

64
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,149
Speaker 0: See how it's all burned.

65
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:22,793
Speaker 1: She's the smoke.

66
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:23,680
Speaker 1: is the fire extinguisher?

67
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:28,616
Speaker 0: No I just like basically just unplugged it and I just sort of like kicked at it and I've been.

68
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:29,599
Speaker 0: the fire went out right away.

69
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:34,359
Speaker 0: Mmm, it was a tiny fire and it was mostly just like I think I think it was.

70
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:38,320
Speaker 0: It was simmering for a while and there was mostly heat.

71
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:41,690
Speaker 0: The fire was only right in like the entrance point there.

72
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,251
Speaker 0: Mmm a lot of smoke and char in the case, though I blew a lot of like soot out of the power supply.

73
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:52,307
Speaker 0: Mmm, but the funniest thing was The power supply sending bad power.

74
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,740
Speaker 1: I am incredibly confident that I get a new power supply.

75
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,680
Speaker 1: Anyway, isn't one of the power supply ends all burnt?

76
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:02,865
Speaker 0: No, cuz actually the that end Was an adapter cable anyway.

77
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:07,640
Speaker 0: Oh and I suspected maybe the cable was the problem, but that does not appear to be the case.

78
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:10,979
Speaker 0: It looks like the fire originated in the SSD itself.

79
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:12,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was fun.

80
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,520
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's Tuesday.

81
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:23,880
Speaker 0: This is only tangentially related to gaming because if you're a gamer and you have a PC You probably have an SSD in there and if you're cheap, you probably have an SSD like potato.

82
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:31,314
Speaker 0: So go check what brand your SSD is if you don't know and if it's potato Recommend you could buy a Samsung like soonish.

83
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:32,419
Speaker 1: Yep, maybe.

84
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,208
Speaker 0: So there is actually a ton of gaming news.

85
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:39,240
Speaker 1: well because e3 happens since we did the last gaming show here.

86
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's tons of gaming news to talk about most of it.

87
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:48,840
Speaker 0: We don't give a shit though Yep, but I think the biggest news for me three that I care about is that it's Metroid Christmas.

88
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:56,391
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we're getting now one but two Metroid Eddie's to Metroid Metroid Prime 4.

89
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,316
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah a real game.

90
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:02,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's gonna be fun and Metroid Samus returns man.

91
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:06,055
Speaker 0: Sorry the quote a side-scrolling 3ds game.

92
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:06,436
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

93
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:07,800
Speaker 0: That is that's what I want.

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,559
Speaker 0: I haven't played a side-scrolling Metroid in a while.

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,623
Speaker 1: Well, I got.

96
00:07:10,703 --> 00:07:19,530
Speaker 1: I don't disappoint you but this side-scrolling Metroid game while I'll probably get it and play it Is guts is questionable, right?

97
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:21,958
Speaker 1: It's made by oh shit.

98
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:30,706
Speaker 1: Yeah Okay, it's made by some people who have made some other Not the greatest You know games, right?

99
00:07:30,746 --> 00:07:32,030
Speaker 1: They don't have a great track record.

100
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,860
Speaker 0: I'm looking at a deeper site on this right now.

101
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:42,420
Speaker 1: It's sort of a redo Moses pretty much just a redo of Metroid 2 for the Gameboy which first comment.

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,829
Speaker 0: So this is just a remake of Metroid to the recertive Samus.

103
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:48,397
Speaker 0: that would explain why Nintendo C and D?

104
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,183
Speaker 0: that am to our fan Game reason.

105
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:53,500
Speaker 1: Well, no Nintendo C and D is everything even if they weren't doing this, right?

106
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,299
Speaker 1: But this is probably gonna be worse than that fan game was.

107
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:58,282
Speaker 1: They are.

108
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:08,170
Speaker 1: you can watch videos to learn all about this game, but you know, I'll probably get it but it don't don't Okay, so there's a way worse indicator here.

109
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,758
Speaker 0: Samus now has free aiming.

110
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:18,519
Speaker 1: Yeah So don't a fan of that inside scrolling Metroid, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up about this game.

111
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,274
Speaker 0: So is it's just Metroid Hanukkah.

112
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:21,817
Speaker 0: It's not much right.

113
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,704
Speaker 1: Christmas Matronik is better.

114
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:28,959
Speaker 0: You get eight days eight days of inferior presence as opposed to one day of blowing your whole low point.

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,587
Speaker 1: is Metroid Prime 4 though can't go wrong.

116
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,313
Speaker 1: No cannot go wrong.

117
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,780
Speaker 0: That's just getting played immediately cannot go wrong.

118
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,869
Speaker 1: Did you play Metroid Prime 1 2 3?

119
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,034
Speaker 0: no, I played him a little bit.

120
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,279
Speaker 0: I thought you were okay.

121
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,072
Speaker 1: Just go straight to 4.

122
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:44,677
Speaker 0: why not?

123
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:46,583
Speaker 0: Why not?

124
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:48,550
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know shit about Metroid.

125
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:51,220
Speaker 0: I only played like three hours of Twilight Princess.

126
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:55,909
Speaker 1: You know what it looks like Can't even ice beam, bro What's wrong with you?

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,502
Speaker 0: Ah Did I ever?

128
00:08:57,542 --> 00:09:00,535
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever beat Metroid 1 without using a code?

129
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:09,720
Speaker 0: because oh my god No Because if I died near the end of the game I was unwilling to farm to refill my energy tanks because I just that was lame.

130
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,693
Speaker 0: So I would use codes or things just to start with all that full.

131
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:16,404
Speaker 1: just play like Metroid Prime Zero mission instead.

132
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,310
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, which is actually really good.

133
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:23,749
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll play that and stream it on your GBA On my emulator GBA.

134
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,420
Speaker 0: Okay, actually I got a bunch of GBA is laying around somewhere.

135
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:26,803
Speaker 1: I got.

136
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:28,758
Speaker 1: I got a ton of you got a bunch of GBA's.

137
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:33,120
Speaker 0: Cuz we got to save those because I got tons of Nintendo portable goods.

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,127
Speaker 0: Well, cuz we guess that's the good area to bust out.

139
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:38,118
Speaker 0: the Crystal Chronicles the old four swords the warrior where?

140
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,831
Speaker 0: That's really the only three news.

141
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:41,697
Speaker 0: I care about though.

142
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:45,027
Speaker 0: in Saturn news it looks like at e3.

143
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:50,070
Speaker 0: a bunch of people saw there's a ton more footage from Nidhogg 2 which is gonna be on the ps4.

144
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:56,180
Speaker 1: and Uh, we already look at every time I've seen it and I've seen it at pack.

145
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,607
Speaker 1: Less excited is I've never been.

146
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:03,020
Speaker 1: I was zero excited when I saw the first screenshot and now I'm just like completely ignoring it.

147
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,153
Speaker 1: I'm like, I wrote it off.

148
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:08,044
Speaker 1: as soon as I saw it at PAX I a hundred percent wrote it off.

149
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:11,803
Speaker 1: it went from 90 percent to a hundred and Thousand percent.

150
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:12,525
Speaker 0: I'm down.

151
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,571
Speaker 0: I'm down to negative at this point.

152
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:28,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm saying I've written it off over a thousand percents because now I've seen a whole bunch of live gameplay footage and I've heard the Developers and like a bunch of people talking about it and like talking about their gameplay experiences.

153
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:32,229
Speaker 0: I Don't want to get too deep because this is purely like.

154
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:38,355
Speaker 0: this is a semi uninformed opinion based on Other people talking and watching video footage.

155
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,306
Speaker 0: I Don't think it is going to be as good as a of a game as Nidhogg one Irrespective of the graphics.

156
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:51,199
Speaker 0: I am so not looking forward to actually playing this game.

157
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:52,808
Speaker 1: So don't play it.

158
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,277
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play it cuz.

159
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:58,172
Speaker 1: I gotta know I'm really not looking forward to doing this thing that I could not.

160
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,380
Speaker 1: I don't have to do but I'm gonna do anyway.

161
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,380
Speaker 0: You gotta know you guys is really disgusting food.

162
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,190
Speaker 1: I'm really not looking forward to eating poop, but I just got to eat it.

163
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,740
Speaker 0: I gotta give the real review.

164
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,437
Speaker 1: Hey, I got a bamboo for you to smell.

165
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:17,740
Speaker 0: I smelled that bamboo and you know, I did and I push that bamboo and that caused far greater disaster not to me.

166
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,246
Speaker 0: I'm gonna smell the bamboo.

167
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:19,969
Speaker 1: I don't know.

168
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,455
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the bamboo smells like.

169
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:23,506
Speaker 1: I'm Sullied.

170
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:25,178
Speaker 1: you're gonna be sullied by this.

171
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,518
Speaker 0: Smelled the way stale vomit would taste if you drank it.

172
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,480
Speaker 0: That was the worst vomit smell I've ever smelled.

173
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:42,040
Speaker 1: You're gonna feel that feel on your fingers and you play Nidhogg - it's gonna say that it's gonna feel like touching stale vomit.

174
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,522
Speaker 0: I'm telling.

175
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:47,039
Speaker 0: I say what I just said as someone whose bodies like go to.

176
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,939
Speaker 0: Solution to most problems is vomit my bod that doesn't vomit to fix your fire away.

177
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:55,325
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try that after.

178
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,152
Speaker 0: I I think rebooting will fix it.

179
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,799
Speaker 0: But if that doesn't maybe my body of vomit.

180
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:12,534
Speaker 0: but yeah, now that I've heard a bunch of like the developers talking about the game and game journalists talking about it, uh Based on which game journalists liked it and what they said that they liked about

181
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:13,377
Speaker 1: it who liked it,

182
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,348
Speaker 0: uh Well, let's save that but that you can.

183
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:17,874
Speaker 0: walling to this you can watch.

184
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:19,259
Speaker 0: there's a 20-minute video here.

185
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:20,678
Speaker 0: Well, you want to smell the bamboo?

186
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:32,100
Speaker 0: This is 20 minutes of some in-hug talk and every second will drain Enthusiasm from your soul about this game and there's tons of more e3 news, but there's another important news.

187
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,126
Speaker 1: We got to talk about that.

188
00:12:33,146 --> 00:12:34,152
Speaker 1: We have a lot to say.

189
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:39,060
Speaker 0: even though it's not the biggest deal Yeah, it's a huge deal to a small number of gamers, right?

190
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,792
Speaker 1: So there's a if you don't know there's a company called geek a chic.

191
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:44,177
Speaker 0: we talked about them.

192
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:44,618
Speaker 0: we on gig night.

193
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,860
Speaker 1: We saw them As far as we know the very first time they were on display.

194
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:51,863
Speaker 1: Was it oh wait?

195
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,055
Speaker 0: or oh no, this was back when special guests.

196
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,103
Speaker 1: I think it was oh nine Special guys.

197
00:12:56,143 --> 00:13:00,220
Speaker 0: the packs used to get their own like pre access.

198
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,983
Speaker 1: We went to the expo hall for one hour early before right anyway, I don't think you can do that anymore Disappeared.

199
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:13,338
Speaker 1: we went into the expo hall at PAX an hour early and we saw these gaming tables and we were you know Like ten years younger than we are now.

200
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:16,820
Speaker 1: And we're like, whoa, check out these amazing gaming tables.

201
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,940
Speaker 1: Wouldn't you love to play D&D on this fucking thing?

202
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,894
Speaker 0: Holy shit, like I was so excited and like I really wanted one.

203
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:32,778
Speaker 1: and on the one hand, you know These tables were not the most attractive tables I really wanted you know modern furniture looking table and not antique furniture looking table at first glance.

204
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:33,540
Speaker 0: They look good.

205
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,424
Speaker 0: Well, we'll get back to that.

206
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,071
Speaker 0: but it's not even just that.

207
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:37,156
Speaker 0: they're an older style.

208
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:48,274
Speaker 0: and well We have multiple friends who actually know a lot about cabinet making and furniture craft and they have all said the same thing These tables are a mishmash of a bunch of different styles and techniques.

209
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:52,840
Speaker 0: that makes them look like ridiculous Camaro monsters to anyone who knows anything about furniture.

210
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,522
Speaker 1: Yeah They don't.

211
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:54,347
Speaker 1: there's no like.

212
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,442
Speaker 1: you could look at this table on its own and be like wow Look at that gaming table Like you could.

213
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:04,380
Speaker 1: it would be so awesome to play D&D on that and then you put it in any room in any house on Earth and it just doesn't match anything.

214
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,840
Speaker 0: It'd be like if you walk into a room that had like art deco tiles But the molding was like 17th century molding and the carpet was shag carpet.

215
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:13,924
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that's.

216
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:15,370
Speaker 0: that's what these look like to anyone.

217
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,040
Speaker 0: Anyway, anything about furniture regardless of aesthetics, right?

218
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,146
Speaker 1: I mean you might like crazy mixed-up style, but maybe Aesthetics are just matter of taste, right?

219
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:36,880
Speaker 1: I've also heard people say, you know that while these tables are you know, they're okay They are not Okay, considering the price for the price of these tables six to ten thousand dollars for like a full kit.

220
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:44,371
Speaker 1: Yeah the crappiest table they offer is like 1400 and like average like 3500 is really the starting price for a somewhat real table.

221
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:48,326
Speaker 0: now if you spent that much on a table That isn't a gaming table.

222
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,400
Speaker 0: You're buying like an heirloom piece of furniture.

223
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,720
Speaker 1: You get a mag you get a magnificent magnificent incredible regular table for that price.

224
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and I mean not the best table but a magnificent excellent table that'll probably last not only your life But like your grandchildren's.

225
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:09,228
Speaker 0: but a big part of why people were so excited about these I think was that no one else was serving this.

226
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:09,669
Speaker 1: Yes.

227
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 1: This was that they basically invented this market, right?

228
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,125
Speaker 1: It was an idea people had.

229
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,434
Speaker 1: there were definitely people on the internet.

230
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:17,840
Speaker 1: you'd see on slash that or whatever.

231
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,908
Speaker 0: You see me bitching about this all the time.

232
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:24,268
Speaker 1: people would post pictures of their custom-built gaming tables Like I made one.

233
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:25,899
Speaker 1: check out how awesome I am.

234
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:27,324
Speaker 1: But there was no place.

235
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:44,469
Speaker 1: if you weren't a furniture maker that you could like unless you paid for a custom job from a furniture Person you couldn't get a table that was made for gaming that had things like, you know dice pits or DM trays Cup holders to go off the side where it wouldn't mess up anything.

236
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,549
Speaker 1: or you know insets inlays with felt or or you know The best one was the winner grades.

237
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,056
Speaker 0: You could put the glass on top.

238
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,880
Speaker 0: So it's a normal table.

239
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,959
Speaker 0: You could also inside of it put your giant miniatures, right?

240
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,808
Speaker 1: So you'd put your map right.

241
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:00,340
Speaker 1: then you put a piece of plastic or glass over the map.

242
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:04,680
Speaker 1: Then you put the miniatures on top of that and then you could put leaves on top of that.

243
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,011
Speaker 1: So you could didn't have to like.

244
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:13,550
Speaker 1: you could Turn it back into a regular table eat pizza open it up again The minute minis are still inside.

245
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,720
Speaker 1: you want to stop playing minis and play a board game.

246
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:19,014
Speaker 1: You could bring up the felt panels by flipping over the wooden panels.

247
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,259
Speaker 0: There's definitely a market for.

248
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:21,303
Speaker 0: Forget that.

249
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:23,311
Speaker 0: forget it's practice practicality.

250
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:37,276
Speaker 1: if you were doing heavy tabletop gaming in a place the practicality of them was excellent and they were the first as far as I know people to manufacture them to set some amount of scale and sell them right to the general public.

251
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:45,680
Speaker 0: every time we have played D&D or Any role-playing game in our entire lives the physicality of the space has always been deeply suboptimal.

252
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,320
Speaker 0: Yep, like tables suck ass at this.

253
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:53,100
Speaker 0: I think the only good gaming space we ever had was the pre renovated lounge in Peterson at RIT.

254
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,659
Speaker 1: Even that even that kind of sucked.

255
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,635
Speaker 0: Well, it had the thing that people could sit on sure and then everyone else sat on the floor.

256
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:00,080
Speaker 1: still wasn't good, right?

257
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,903
Speaker 0: That was for the best.

258
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,494
Speaker 1: I think the best use of these though was at gaming stores.

259
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,906
Speaker 1: if you owned a gaming store Oh, yeah You wanted to have one of these for sure.

260
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,080
Speaker 0: nerds had flipped their shit and people would rent time to like play their game at These things.

261
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:16,420
Speaker 1: now geek she's been around for a long time like at you know, oh wait at nine at least, right?

262
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:25,079
Speaker 1: So it's been like six seven eight years a long time and the way their business worked is that you would order the table because Everything was custom ish right customized to some extent.

263
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:28,092
Speaker 1: you'd order the table and pay and then they would.

264
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:34,620
Speaker 1: you'd get in the queue and Then eventually when they finished your table because they handmade everything you'd get your table, right?

265
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:39,360
Speaker 1: And they'd actually drive it over to you and deliver it like like hand deliver it themselves.

266
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,971
Speaker 1: It was like a you know, a fancy kind of operation.

267
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,798
Speaker 1: It's part of why it costs so much money, right?

268
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:51,699
Speaker 1: Yep So that isn't bad, you know that you're paying for that right but The problem is they went out of business.

269
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:55,289
Speaker 1: So people paid for tables.

270
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,594
Speaker 1: They're probably not gonna get.

271
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:57,880
Speaker 1: they've just ceased operations.

272
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,191
Speaker 1: And unless you used a credit card and you cancel the payment or something.

273
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:03,479
Speaker 1: You just lost thousands of dollars.

274
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:14,972
Speaker 0: Yep, and because those lead times were so long and nerds are so obsessed But lead times kept getting longer and because they now that we know we're in some financial trouble They basically kept taking those orders.

275
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:16,439
Speaker 0: Yep to get money.

276
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,490
Speaker 1: So I heard like, you know, maybe I don't know when it was but I read some article that was like Yeah, we brought in like tons and tons of revenues.

277
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:25,580
Speaker 1: We're actually a hundred thousand in the hole.

278
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:28,223
Speaker 0: No, so that's already This company like.

279
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:28,826
Speaker 0: I know a lot.

280
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:32,118
Speaker 0: like I do a lot of business stuff now and I know more about like.

281
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,399
Speaker 0: I know way More about this kind of stuff than I did a few years ago.

282
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:43,679
Speaker 0: If you're doing two million in sales, and you only have a hundred thousand dollar loss I You have to really fuck up to not turn that into a really fucking legit company.

283
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,554
Speaker 0: $100,000 loss on that revenue is totally fine Unless like you've got serious structural problems.

284
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:51,660
Speaker 0: I don't know what you're doing, right?

285
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,269
Speaker 1: But I what I heard is the reason they're going out of business.

286
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:57,580
Speaker 1: I heard they tried to buy some company or something.

287
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,664
Speaker 1: This is like rumors.

288
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:03,159
Speaker 1: I didn't see like a story about this, but I heard from reliable people's.

289
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:09,974
Speaker 1: They were trying to buy some kind of company But the deal was bad and they fucked up this acquisition somehow.

290
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:11,660
Speaker 1: and then that's where they lost all their monies.

291
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,765
Speaker 0: In this article, I'm looking at.

292
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,012
Speaker 0: apparently they were on an episode of Shark Tank.

293
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:16,915
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

294
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:17,035
Speaker 1: 2013.

295
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:22,433
Speaker 0: Okay That's how we know about the two million dollar sales and hundred thousand dollar losses.

296
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,360
Speaker 1: Oh, they mentioned it on that TV shop.

297
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:37,468
Speaker 0: okay, and apparently around that time they tried to sell a equity stake in the company for a paltry $300,000 what like.

298
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:42,886
Speaker 1: but the revenue is two million and you're gonna give 25% for 300 grand.

299
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:46,500
Speaker 0: like I would have formed a fucking company and bought you fuckers.

300
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,638
Speaker 1: I hope the good thing you didn't cuz you'd be screwed.

301
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:48,799
Speaker 1: now.

302
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,227
Speaker 0: No Cuz I if I bought them out.

303
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:57,258
Speaker 1: for if I bought 25% for 300 grand But with 20% wouldn't be giving you a say in shit and they would have fucked up even if you don't cuz then when they went Super fuck up.

304
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:02,383
Speaker 0: I would have made sure I had a buyout clause and I buy the rest of the stupid company out of Receivership or what?

305
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,553
Speaker 0: I'd buy the rest of it out of whatever problem there.

306
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:05,980
Speaker 1: now you'd be in debt if you did that.

307
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, no shit, and then I did take some invest.

308
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,678
Speaker 0: I could make this happen Jesus.

309
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,008
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm not gonna have any of these people.

310
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:12,409
Speaker 1: who are they?

311
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:14,739
Speaker 1: you're gonna go work wherever the stupid factory is.

312
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,075
Speaker 0: No I would yeah, I wouldn't do any actual work and hire people to do.

313
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:27,565
Speaker 0: but I Feel like this company was just deeply mismanaged by people who are naive about business and were passionate about gaming And gaming tables.

314
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,018
Speaker 1: their passion by gaming first and furniture, right?

315
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,492
Speaker 0: I blame them for making this trend where there's a bunch of companies.

316
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,220
Speaker 1: Well, those are actually much more recent the imitators.

317
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:40,120
Speaker 1: I started seeing imitators in the past two three years.

318
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:49,251
Speaker 1: maybe they've been around longer, but I started seeing them out in force recently and they're obviously the imitators are Obviously doing pretty similar work.

319
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,320
Speaker 1: I've never seen anything that wasn't equally gaudy.

320
00:20:51,380 --> 00:21:07,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and I can't tell if the imitators are higher or less quality But their prices are lower and they're not like hand delivering shit and doing this You know, they're doing business more normally some of them But I don't know if any of the imitators are good or not, but their competition is there.

321
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:19,159
Speaker 1: now is the point Had to be putting a hurt on them at least to some degree originally going crazy on Craigslist trying to buy Existing geek chic tables for huge huge markup.

322
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:25,672
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I heard that like origins or Gen Con or something was like, oh my god If anyone has geeky tables, we want to buy them from you dude.

323
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:27,580
Speaker 0: Someone should just start making counterfeits.

324
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:32,080
Speaker 1: I mean, why not just order from many of these imitating companies that is out there?

325
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,959
Speaker 1: I'm sure they're not all bad.

326
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,221
Speaker 1: So

327
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:38,748
Speaker 0: I partly blame that because geek chic one thing that I remember when we talked to them Like way back when we first we

328
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:43,487
Speaker 1: talked to them when they were super new and the guy was way enthusiastic and cool And you know, but they're good people

329
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:48,246
Speaker 0: they they emphasized so heavily like the wood grain And the choice the

330
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:49,631
Speaker 1: same as the guy selling the dice -

331
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,720
Speaker 0: I was getting that there's like a whole

332
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:52,585
Speaker 1: Nerd.

333
00:21:52,646 --> 00:22:05,220
Speaker 0: a whole bunch of nerds and gaming now are Sort of faux obsessed with different wood qualities in like their dice towers and things Despite not actually knowing anything about it's like the people are really into a lot about wood.

334
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:08,402
Speaker 0: They oh, no, the people are buying them don't know shit about wood I don't know.

335
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:11,140
Speaker 1: people buying it don't know but the guy is a wood nerd.

336
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,278
Speaker 0: They get upsold by someone who is a word nerd who basically explains to them how.

337
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:17,064
Speaker 1: you know That's RPG people right?

338
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:21,740
Speaker 1: They love to buy like leather bound DM guide metal dice, right?

339
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love like, you know to feel, you know, steampunk people right?

340
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:27,320
Speaker 1: It's that sort of group of nerds.

341
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,570
Speaker 1: They love you know, the material qualities of things.

342
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,883
Speaker 1: They really get off on that even though they have no idea They can.

343
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:39,148
Speaker 1: But you know, they spend extra money to get.

344
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:43,160
Speaker 1: you know leather bound parchment stuff, you know this kind of thing.

345
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:43,980
Speaker 1: They love that shit.

346
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,104
Speaker 1: So they spend more money on that.

347
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:47,293
Speaker 1: where I'm just like just give me a d6.

348
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:50,359
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter if it's plastic or metal It's gonna roll, right?

349
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:59,236
Speaker 0: I want to see the company that goes the other route and maybe the cool-looking DC makes this shit like IKEA But focuses on functionality and minimalism.

350
00:22:59,256 --> 00:22:59,880
Speaker 1: That's what I want.

351
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:05,517
Speaker 0: I would buy the hell out of an IKEA style table that had this these features built in.

352
00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:08,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, just uh, You know, why don't you start that company?

353
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:10,900
Speaker 0: You know, I think that I don't see I wouldn't want to start one.

354
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,500
Speaker 1: It might fail though because the market for the tables are mostly those RPG people who really like that crafty stuff.

355
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:23,920
Speaker 0: The market is also clearly but maybe that's just live in suburbia because if you live an apartment this shit is literally impossible, right?

356
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,886
Speaker 1: But that's another thing right?

357
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,960
Speaker 1: I wonder if you know, we exist, right?

358
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,680
Speaker 1: But we think like we think that we're the rare person who wants the IKEA silent majority, right?

359
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,947
Speaker 1: could there could it just be a stereotype of RPG people that they like that sort of Aesthetic and that the reality is?

360
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:48,719
Speaker 1: no actually if you made IKEA style, you know modern You know kind of looking furniture that was useful for gaming that people would eat that shit up.

361
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:57,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz like if you want to buy a poker table or like card playing tables They're actually shockingly cheap for like really really fancy ones.

362
00:23:57,638 --> 00:24:00,796
Speaker 0: Yeah so some other news.

363
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:12,666
Speaker 0: a Lot of people were complaining During the reason the new season of overwatch that they appeared to be ranked much lower after their placement matches in the competitive For serious mode.

364
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:14,836
Speaker 0: then they had been previously.

365
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:15,559
Speaker 1: change the system.

366
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:17,144
Speaker 0: It appears that.

367
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:21,054
Speaker 0: and so basically as far as I can tell they do not.

368
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:28,879
Speaker 0: the system does not put stock in How where you were ranked previously and sort of starts from at least a semi clean slate every season.

369
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:29,822
Speaker 1: now I kind of like that.

370
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:35,261
Speaker 0: I kind of hate that because you're not gonna move between season 5 and season 6.

371
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:39,780
Speaker 0: There is no way you're suddenly a silver tier player if you were in platinum before.

372
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:43,760
Speaker 1: Well, I think the the reason I like that is because the game changes a lot, right?

373
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,620
Speaker 1: They add new characters enough to be material or there's new maps and things, right?

374
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:53,680
Speaker 1: So you might suddenly You know be a lot better due to the rules changes and someone else might have a hard time with those rules changes.

375
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:57,580
Speaker 1: That might be cause for a reset if you change the actual game.

376
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:02,120
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you're not changing the game significantly then know that you shouldn't even be resetting at all.

377
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,371
Speaker 1: Why are you even making people do the placement matches again?

378
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:05,718
Speaker 1: Just keep just keep going.

379
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,064
Speaker 0: Yep I that's what I think.

380
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,251
Speaker 0: I think you should keep going forever hearthstone.

381
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:11,740
Speaker 1: their ranking system isn't a real ranking system.

382
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,251
Speaker 1: Is this grind into you right?

383
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,520
Speaker 1: We've not gonna talk about that again.

384
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,262
Speaker 1: So they can't.

385
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:20,980
Speaker 1: they reset it every month every season no matter what you get down ranked a whole everyone gets down ranked.

386
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:23,714
Speaker 1: And I think no you should only do it when there's new cards.

387
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:29,200
Speaker 1: as soon as the new cards You should reset everyone to absolutely zero no matter where they were because suddenly it's a new game.

388
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:34,056
Speaker 1: But if you haven't added any new cards to change the rules of the game or anything, it's the same game.

389
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:37,059
Speaker 0: Just keep it going Even if you change the rules.

390
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:40,850
Speaker 0: I feel like you could keep the existing ranking because people just you can.

391
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,340
Speaker 1: time you can but it is a different game.

392
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,150
Speaker 1: So suddenly your rank is partially influenced by playing a different Sort itself out pretty quick if you just keep playing.

393
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,900
Speaker 1: It would may eventually right but it would be quick.

394
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,985
Speaker 0: I think it depends.

395
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:55,888
Speaker 0: Hearthstone ain't that complicated.

396
00:25:55,908 --> 00:26:01,600
Speaker 1: Imagine if we're playing chess for a month and then in the second month We're playing backgammon, but we're still ranked based on our chess play.

397
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:08,747
Speaker 0: Yeah But the difference between those two games is more than the combined changes to every quake multiplayer game in history combined.

398
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:14,520
Speaker 1: I guess when you add a character to an art to an FPS or a fighting game That's not an enormous change like a map or something, right?

399
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,580
Speaker 1: But if you add cards to a card game, it's basically a whole new fucking game.

400
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:25,447
Speaker 0: But it appears to that the system seems to rank people now Lower than what the real rank is.

401
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:28,920
Speaker 0: so they'll feel that sense of progress as they catch up to their actual rank.

402
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,451
Speaker 1: So they're not doing it for actual competitive reason.

403
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,696
Speaker 1: It's good in the competitive mode.

404
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,539
Speaker 1: You shouldn't be doing that.

405
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:36,960
Speaker 0: So I don't have any like confirmation of that.

406
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:48,839
Speaker 0: But many many very skilled players said that this is what they experienced that as soon as they got into the system with their rank Which was low they immediately rose like cat rapidly through the ranks just by playing matches again

407
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:49,323
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

408
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:51,260
Speaker 0: so I experienced the flip side of this.

409
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:58,400
Speaker 1: Well, isn't that also a bad experience for the people who suck getting paired with people who rank getting their asses kicked in a few rounds?

410
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,592
Speaker 1: Well, they yeah as other people grind up on them.

411
00:27:01,732 --> 00:27:04,161
Speaker 0: So I did something I've never done before for season 5.

412
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:11,324
Speaker 0: I played all my ranking matches, especially now that it's all at once all not all at once but solo Meaning.

413
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:14,760
Speaker 0: I was just matched with random shit lords and not with your friends.

414
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:23,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't play any not not one with any of my friends Mm-hmm, and let me tell you I played a couple matches were like two people on the other team.

415
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:25,180
Speaker 0: I looked up their stats.

416
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:43,160
Speaker 0: They were diamond last season and I'm on a team We're like one of my dudes clearly has not played the game for more than like a couple weeks like they did not fly as diva at any point that I could see and So I got ranked the lowest I've ever experienced in my life in the high silvers.

417
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,073
Speaker 0: Holy shit, are people terrible at this game down there.

418
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:56,520
Speaker 0: Once I got into the main matches I walk around games like a god like I single-handedly can win games for my team no matter how bad they are sometimes.

419
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:57,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, this is crazy.

420
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,220
Speaker 1: This is a fundamental problem.

421
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:10,000
Speaker 1: Is that I'm not I don't know about the overwatch specifically but rocket League Which I actually just tried to play again and I lost most of my skills just did not having played for a long ass time And I didn't have that many skills.

422
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:12,248
Speaker 1: I was basically super good.

423
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:14,579
Speaker 1: if no one can fly which is what everyone can do.

424
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:22,306
Speaker 1: I've been in overwatch But anyway, all these games team base because you could if you were just single people playing the game on your own Like it was just chess.

425
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,320
Speaker 1: you could just yellow per if you really wanted to right which is what you should do.

426
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:34,140
Speaker 1: But when you have a team game, it's like alright How do we judge you when you're on a team because like personally right if I'm on a team with good people like who are?

427
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:40,424
Speaker 1: Good my play is elevated and this happens even in Professional sports.

428
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:45,158
Speaker 1: you have players like for example this year basketball right basketball this year.

429
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,125
Speaker 1: It's over now Kevin Durant.

430
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:50,480
Speaker 1: Kevin Durant is a guy who everyone knew was a great player, right?

431
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,000
Speaker 1: He was terrific, but he was on the Oklahoma City Thunder right playing with some other pretty good players, right?

432
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:57,106
Speaker 1: No, but he never.

433
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,654
Speaker 1: he was known.

434
00:28:58,675 --> 00:28:59,519
Speaker 1: it was his thing.

435
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:04,095
Speaker 1: Basically you always got to the playoffs in round one and lost.

436
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:05,158
Speaker 1: get to the.

437
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:05,740
Speaker 1: that was the thing.

438
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,001
Speaker 1: They're like.

439
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:06,583
Speaker 1: you can't win.

440
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:07,547
Speaker 1: shit Kevin Durant.

441
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:08,330
Speaker 1: If you're so great.

442
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,620
Speaker 1: How come you always lose in the first round of the playoffs, right?

443
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:14,011
Speaker 1: So this year he split.

444
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:23,205
Speaker 1: he left the OKC Thunder and he went to the Golden State Warriors the best or second best team there is and He just totally killed it.

445
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:28,120
Speaker 1: He's you know, that team already had won a championship two years ago, right?

446
00:29:28,582 --> 00:29:38,060
Speaker 1: And you know came really close to winning the championship last year Basically should have won last year right and lost like the last three games of a seven game series and the seventh game.

447
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,923
Speaker 1: They lost right.

448
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:46,099
Speaker 1: They were ahead three one and then this year he goes to that team and a team That was already that good.

449
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:50,556
Speaker 1: He was the best player on that team and they just dominated and just they were in.

450
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,567
Speaker 0: they were fat happen I was.

451
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,920
Speaker 1: there was seven game series.

452
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,536
Speaker 1: They won four sweep sweep sweep and then I think the last one there were.

453
00:29:58,556 --> 00:29:59,439
Speaker 1: it was like four and one.

454
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:01,840
Speaker 0: That happens so consistently in overwatch.

455
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,922
Speaker 1: So if I play on a team with good people, I'm better and if I play at a team with shitty people You're right.

456
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:07,605
Speaker 1: It's hard.

457
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:17,158
Speaker 1: Even though we gotta play differently even though my individual skill is the same It's harder for me to get kills cuz like I'm swarmed by My teammates aren't help, right?

458
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,414
Speaker 0: So like if you're on a good team You can blind pass and trust someone will be in their spot.

459
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:24,154
Speaker 0: on a shitty team You gotta like look first, right?

460
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:26,758
Speaker 1: So So that's a thing.

461
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:42,949
Speaker 1: but also all of these games is most of them are using a system that Microsoft invented called Microsoft true skill and you can read all the math behind Microsoft true skill that you want but Microsoft true skill ranks you up and down Based solely on winning and losing.

462
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,440
Speaker 1: it doesn't give a fuck at all about your individual results.

463
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:59,435
Speaker 1: So you're playing racks if you play rocket league and you're on a team with two Basically people who are afk and you score 20 fucking goals But the other team has three average players and they score 21 goals.

464
00:31:00,784 --> 00:31:02,903
Speaker 1: You might as well have scored zero goals It might.

465
00:31:03,024 --> 00:31:05,679
Speaker 1: the system that ranks you doesn't give a fuck and your rate goes down.

466
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:08,380
Speaker 1: It gives no shits about your individual abilities.

467
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:13,495
Speaker 1: It is so unsubtle and all these systems are based on just win and lose.

468
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:15,040
Speaker 1: They don't look at any of that stuff.

469
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:28,294
Speaker 1: So the rankings for your team-based gameplay are always fucked up in all of these games because no one has put the effort in to figure out the math to actually subtly look at individual stats and say oh look,

470
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:32,552
Speaker 0: so Overwatch does track a lot of those individual stats, but

471
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,220
Speaker 1: how are they affected in your rank?

472
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,506
Speaker 1: Is it possible for you to go?

473
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:37,295
Speaker 1: has your rank ever gone up in a game?

474
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:37,818
Speaker 1: You've lost?

475
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:38,160
Speaker 0: I don't know.

476
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,380
Speaker 0: I don't even look at my rank, right?

477
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,362
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying like it's possible for your rank to go up in a game You lose.

478
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,230
Speaker 0: it may well be using that because they don't.

479
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:54,980
Speaker 0: I don't think they've published exactly how all this works But I've seen reports of people who say that like if they heal really well even a losing game They've gone up in the season.

480
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,080
Speaker 1: That's what I don't know, but it's very published and I've never haven't played overwatch.

481
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,259
Speaker 1: I don't know what they do specifically, but I'm saying most of the team-based games are you know?

482
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:08,375
Speaker 0: I say that's fine because these games are four teams.

483
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,728
Speaker 0: if you're playing as an individual You're already doing something weird.

484
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:13,503
Speaker 0: you play this game as a team No, but it's.

485
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,451
Speaker 1: but your rank is an individual rank.

486
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:20,020
Speaker 0: right if but if you play as a consistent team of six Then your team you're a consistent team of six.

487
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Speaker 1: They should just use elo and not let you play with other people, right?

488
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,892
Speaker 1: We're talking about when you play on your own with rando people.

489
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:32,875
Speaker 1: if you're six people who are stuck together You know the New York over watches Then you just don't even need to rank the individual people.

490
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:33,800
Speaker 1: your team has a ring.

491
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:41,440
Speaker 0: No, you're right the individual people because one day if they if someone consistently plays on teams that do good Then they are probably a better player if they consistently on teams itself.

492
00:32:41,581 --> 00:32:44,231
Speaker 1: Obviously, that's true that the rank isn't completely.

493
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,720
Speaker 1: and I'm not saying the rank is garbage and worthless, right?

494
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:55,200
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's always frustratingly slightly wrong Because it's not paying attention enough to how good an individual is.

495
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,214
Speaker 0: But at the same time how good an individual is is pretty worthless in a game.

496
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:01,060
Speaker 0: That is so heavily team dependent.

497
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,671
Speaker 1: Well, yeah overwatch is more team dependent than say rocket league.

498
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:08,803
Speaker 1: one good person on a rocket league team or basketball for that 100% win.

499
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,449
Speaker 1: you just can just carry the team.

500
00:33:10,469 --> 00:33:19,720
Speaker 0: how to strike - if you're really good at like head click flicks And you memorize your corners like you minding on the makeup of the teams You could carry your team and you would rank up pretty quickly.

501
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:19,941
Speaker 1: But

502
00:33:19,961 --> 00:33:34,193
Speaker 0: like overwatch like if I'm if I'm Reinhardt the big shield hammer guy Which is why main lately if I'm on a good team and we get a pick when we're attacking I will immediately charge a healer or something because I know my team's right behind me because we got the pick.

503
00:33:34,815 --> 00:33:37,927
Speaker 0: if I do that when I'm Playing with randos or like silver tears.

504
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,513
Speaker 0: It's instant death for me.

505
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,440
Speaker 0: So I have to play that completely differently.

506
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:49,559
Speaker 0: so I have like If I talk to my team before I play with randos to figure out if I think they're shitheads or not And then I play very differently depending if they're shitheads.

507
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:52,221
Speaker 1: I'm just saying like, you know It should.

508
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:57,318
Speaker 1: the game should detect right that you're better than shitheads and you should never be playing with them ever.

509
00:33:57,338 --> 00:34:05,483
Speaker 1: Yeah You know just because you might get into a bad streak We're like, okay, even though you're playing with good players, which means you're playing against good players You're gonna lose.

510
00:34:05,964 --> 00:34:09,315
Speaker 1: but it should still know this person is too good for that.

511
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:10,400
Speaker 1: those people down.

512
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:14,460
Speaker 0: But I found that the system so the placement matches are all over the place because you're reset.

513
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:25,237
Speaker 1: So you're playing with like this crazy wide spread, but once I got into the regular enough people playing this very popular game You should never have to be playing with anyone too far away from your own during their matchmaking the initial placement matches.

514
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:25,600
Speaker 0: you will.

515
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:27,106
Speaker 1: Oh during the initial placement matches.

516
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:31,306
Speaker 1: You should be forced to play with like all different ranks You should be able to.

517
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:32,900
Speaker 1: you should be playing with like pros.

518
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:40,094
Speaker 1: You should have at least one game with pro people a game with almost pro people a game with the most garbage people who don't Even know how to control the game.

519
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:40,600
Speaker 1: what I found?

520
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:41,121
Speaker 1: Then?

521
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:45,400
Speaker 1: it could do the best job of figuring out where you belong because I clearly don't belong in that ranking.

522
00:34:46,181 --> 00:34:51,120
Speaker 0: My rating has just been going up and up and up and up and up just at a constant rate since the regular game started.

523
00:34:51,362 --> 00:35:07,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the people in the Silver's pretty bad But also shockingly really really friendly like I haven't run into the weird like shittiness that everyone keeps complaining about that This season mm-hmm like everyone's complaining about throwers and people freaking out And it's so rare that like it's really notable when that happens to man.

524
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,552
Speaker 1: I don't know why rowers like you lose the game on purpose.

525
00:35:09,572 --> 00:35:10,820
Speaker 0: There's a ton of people who just do that.

526
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,360
Speaker 1: Why no one knows what's the I mean?

527
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:25,079
Speaker 0: There's usually a reason to do that But just they're jerks the trolls there's no benefit of doing or they're doing it to get a really low Ranking so they can then team up with their high ranking friends and bring their rating down so they play against worse people.

528
00:35:26,622 --> 00:35:29,860
Speaker 0: And one last thing that's also related to not just overwatch of a blizzard in general.

529
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,796
Speaker 0: So twitch and blizzard now have a formal exclusive streaming arrangement.

530
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:40,500
Speaker 1: Yeah with the two-year term It's not really a big deal because already blizzard was streaming all their shit on switch.

531
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:43,800
Speaker 0: But they're also officially, but there was also streaming on other platforms.

532
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,708
Speaker 1: I didn't see any streaming another platform.

533
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:48,440
Speaker 0: this article specifically says that has happened numerous times.

534
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:49,023
Speaker 1: I've never.

535
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,228
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I've never seen it right.

536
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:51,232
Speaker 1: twitch has always been.

537
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:53,020
Speaker 0: I don't watch anything other than overwatch.

538
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:56,580
Speaker 1: I'm just saying twitch has always been the number one place to watch blizzard stuff.

539
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,569
Speaker 1: So this just sort of makes it more official.

540
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,800
Speaker 0: It looks like a lot of it was on Facebook, too.

541
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:01,843
Speaker 1: I've never seen that.

542
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:03,690
Speaker 0: a lot of people watch gaming on Facebook.

543
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,011
Speaker 0: Apparently.

544
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:16,598
Speaker 0: I don't know why why you do that, but It's interesting that these are the kinds of arrangements that happened in regular sports And you're starting to see these things happen like more and more in eSports.

545
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:23,411
Speaker 0: This is like one more of those stepping stones on the way to eSports being Super professional just like regular sports are.

546
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:34,441
Speaker 1: the real news is that if you have twitch prime Which you do because you have Amazon Prime because you buy things on Amazon like a modern person You're gonna basically get the loot for Amazon for twitch prime has not been great Like.

547
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:37,973
Speaker 1: I've looked at it every time there's new loot in there and it's usually worthless stuff.

548
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:40,766
Speaker 1: I don't like cosmetic shit for games I'm never gonna play.

549
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:41,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I just ignore it.

550
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:47,480
Speaker 1: But you're gonna get loot crates for your overwatch guarantee.

551
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,800
Speaker 1: They already decided that but there's gonna be stuff for also all the other Blizzard games.

552
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,420
Speaker 1: You know the Diablos and the hearthstones and the Starcrafts and the whatever.

553
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:58,598
Speaker 1: So, you know probably get some free hearthstone packs and you'll someone else will probably get some.

554
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,833
Speaker 1: you know Skins for what the heroes of the storm piece of shit.

555
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,040
Speaker 1: I just I hope that some Mounts or something.

556
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:14,419
Speaker 0: I really want that aspect of eSports to disappear because it just feels like all those shitty panels at cons Where they throw garbage free stuff into the audience to get people to show up.

557
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:16,900
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is it's funnily enough, right?

558
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,929
Speaker 0: But it is also like what regular sports do.

559
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,677
Speaker 0: you go to a hockey game and they give you a shitty towel.

560
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:33,918
Speaker 1: in all these other games it's like The loot is like all cosmetic worthless shit, but in hearthstone It's actually because the CCG packs of cards are always are a real thing sort of right?

561
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:37,377
Speaker 1: Yeah But like part that they also do cosmetic shit.

562
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:41,433
Speaker 1: in hearthstone They give you like new character skins and card backs and I give a shit.

563
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:43,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, just even more cards.

564
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:51,073
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

565
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:56,340
Speaker 0: this video is pretty good But it's something that I always was fascinated by and this sort of just explains it really succinctly.

566
00:37:57,182 --> 00:38:03,240
Speaker 0: It explains in detail how VHS VCRs work and why is it just analog tape the same as a cassette?

567
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, what does that mean?

568
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Speaker 1: It did you take the analog signal that TVs like to input like the one that comes over the air.

569
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:14,587
Speaker 1: So I record it to an analog already Scott and then play it back To the TV already.

570
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:18,000
Speaker 0: That's actually a crazy difficult problem because the frequencies involved.

571
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:23,548
Speaker 0: Okay, this explains in extreme Extreme detail but in probably the level.

572
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:31,904
Speaker 0: this explains in a level of detail that many of you who don't might find fascinating because the VCRs are actually Shockingly complex.

573
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:35,600
Speaker 1: and when you back in that of amazing back in the day at a TV station, right?

574
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,633
Speaker 1: If you broadcast a show you would record the show.

575
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:41,664
Speaker 1: Yeah broadcasting is Incredibly different.

576
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:47,066
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you would record it to a reel to reel tape and then to do a rerun Play the real tape and brought.

577
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:51,560
Speaker 0: actually for a long time TV was broadcast live and could not be recorded.

578
00:38:51,741 --> 00:39:02,453
Speaker 1: I know that but I'm saying once they had recorded TV they would just do unreal to real tape and then they would rerun it and just send it or read it from the Recorded tape was already a huge problem.

579
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:08,580
Speaker 0: because of the frequencies involved It was almost impossible to make a consumer version of this in any capacity.

580
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,046
Speaker 1: That's why VCRs have those modes because it's heavily compressed and they throw out a lot of the data Real to real tape.

581
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,260
Speaker 0: you have no idea how LP AP all the SLP modes work.

582
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,409
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that that isn't that how it works.

583
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:25,039
Speaker 1: you record an analog signal to a tape and then you play it back Just like a cassette tape only with video.

584
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:31,160
Speaker 0: Uh, actually not at all just like a cassette tape and this video explains in pretty interesting detail exactly how it works.

585
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,250
Speaker 1: How could it be so different?

586
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,260
Speaker 0: Well, you should watch this video.

587
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,376
Speaker 0: I think you clearly don't know anything about helical recording

588
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:35,900
Speaker 1: anyway

589
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:52,205
Speaker 0: but it's just a pretty good video because I even when I was a kid like I knew a lot about like Why SLP worked and what hi-fi mode was probably cuz I was bootlegging movies and like an anime fan subs I know like ripping macro vision out and none of my friends knew like.

590
00:39:52,646 --> 00:39:58,860
Speaker 0: I had a friend who was recording a bunch of stuff and he literally his VCR was an SLP mode and he in it for years.

591
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:02,555
Speaker 0: He never actually knew what that mode was and what that switch did it does.

592
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:06,008
Speaker 0: the switch was on SLP More qualities, but less note recording time.

593
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,475
Speaker 0: SLP is shit quality record for it.

594
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:09,860
Speaker 1: I mean the different modes.

595
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,120
Speaker 1: I don't know which one is which SLP is bad quality.

596
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,600
Speaker 1: Okay, you're choosing either low quality but lots of recording time or high quality less recording.

597
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:21,389
Speaker 0: There were actually three modes right middle mode Disappeared from almost all VCRs.

598
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:24,320
Speaker 1: pretty early on all the VCRs ever saw had the three modes.

599
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,427
Speaker 0: They would all play all three modes But very few would record in all three modes.

600
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:32,460
Speaker 0: interesting if you had one that recorded in all three years either old or super high.

601
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,090
Speaker 1: I'll certainly go to buy blank tapes and some of them were had.

602
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:42,020
Speaker 1: the ones that were more expensive ones that had more tape in Them yep, so you could record longer, but the ones that have more tape in them also were way more prone to failure.

603
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,044
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

604
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:44,309
Speaker 1: I mean how could a tape fail?

605
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,614
Speaker 1: you either break it or you don't?

606
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,382
Speaker 0: you never had a. you never had a Tape.

607
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,380
Speaker 0: get stuck in the VCR more have it on spool.

608
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,408
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of common.

609
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:52,920
Speaker 0: never had it or the tape would just snap.

610
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:56,757
Speaker 1: But I did see a lot of jokes like people would that you'd see like a joke like a cartoon.

611
00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:57,359
Speaker 1: you'd see a VCR.

612
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,846
Speaker 1: We're like tape spewing out of it.

613
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,995
Speaker 0: I said that happened to me multiple times.

614
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:01,980
Speaker 1: I never saw that in real life.

615
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,760
Speaker 0: I saw in real life partly cuz I was bootlegging videos all over the fuck place anyway.

616
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:12,926
Speaker 1: So here speaking of old TV from the analog days is the recording of some old TV from Japan.

617
00:41:13,027 --> 00:41:32,176
Speaker 1: and usually when you're checking old TV from Japan it's usually something like some wacky show or anime or a commercial for something that you know is Japanese like Oh famous American actor does a commercial for a product in Japan or Nintendo commercial from Japan, but here is something that I haven't seen before.

618
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:49,487
Speaker 1: this is American products that were sold in Japan like yeah Like you know for kids mostly right like Jack Jack slime Coosh ball tennis thing and oh and much much more Right, but sold in Japan.

619
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:53,238
Speaker 1: and here's the commercials for those American products that we know from America, right?

620
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,998
Speaker 1: It's sort of the opposite deal.

621
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,679
Speaker 0: It's interesting to see which parts of these are very similar to the American advertising and which parts of them are drastically different.

622
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:06,276
Speaker 0: Yep Actually remember a lot of the American ads for a lot of these products.

623
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,064
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah A lot of them are real simple.

624
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:10,354
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is really fascinating and fun to watch.

625
00:42:10,414 --> 00:42:11,118
Speaker 1: So check it out.

626
00:42:11,158 --> 00:42:13,646
Speaker 1: And also Why is it always Japan?

627
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:14,892
Speaker 1: Can we see this like show?

628
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:16,619
Speaker 1: show me like the I don't know.

629
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,594
Speaker 1: I guess it was to the Soviet Union still existed.

630
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:24,336
Speaker 1: So there wouldn't be like dude Slovakia and commercials forget stuff is on YouTube.

631
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,280
Speaker 0: I'll make it my thing in the day.

632
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,872
Speaker 1: Let's go watch like the Belgian commercial for gacking slime, right?

633
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,036
Speaker 0: or you know?

634
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:35,000
Speaker 0: when I found a bunch of that stuff When I was looking for anime openers around the world, I actually found a lot of commercials and things.

635
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, was there an Australian commercial for sliming gag?

636
00:42:37,913 --> 00:42:39,018
Speaker 1: Oh, I buy some gag.

637
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:43,109
Speaker 0: Oh That that I don't know if that's an Australian accent or not.

638
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,513
Speaker 0: I'll try it.

639
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:45,676
Speaker 1: buy some gag mate.

640
00:42:46,017 --> 00:42:46,398
Speaker 0: Good.

641
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:50,965
Speaker 0: I good on ya No eyes.

642
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:57,159
Speaker 0: The book club book is Frank Herbert's, dude, I'm reading it.

643
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:01,180
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read it next week cuz I'm flying to London and I'm sure I'll be done with it.

644
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,068
Speaker 0: When I get back from London, I'm all spiced up.

645
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,297
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be spiced up and spiced out.

646
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:06,040
Speaker 0: spice everywhere.

647
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:14,605
Speaker 0: I'm really just not looking forward to this cuz I just Partly because I got Prince of Nothing on the mind again I want to actually that's.

648
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:18,241
Speaker 1: I'm reading it now because I want to finish it because Prince of Nothing's coming away soon yep,

649
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:27,520
Speaker 0: and even if the later books concluding the Prince of Nothing do not have quite the same level of Certain kinds of artistry that the earlier books did I gotta know what happens.

650
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:33,681
Speaker 0: I gotta know what the deal is with all the biz and I know that these books are gonna wrap it all up because that's Just.

651
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:36,558
Speaker 0: how are you sure you should do not on our website?

652
00:43:36,638 --> 00:43:37,402
Speaker 0: actually I will.

653
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,950
Speaker 0: I just haven't I've been busy and bored.

654
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,940
Speaker 0: and to do that a busy busy board.

655
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,908
Speaker 0: Yeah Also, I Restarted something that many of you been asking me for.

656
00:43:48,928 --> 00:43:55,045
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be streaming advanced Wars all different advanced Wars games Regularly on YouTube.

657
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:58,758
Speaker 0: cuz a lot of people are asking for it and a bunch of people watch like I had like 20 30 people.

658
00:43:59,361 --> 00:43:59,864
Speaker 0: It's not.

659
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:02,059
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of advanced Wars content out there.

660
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,606
Speaker 1: You don't have much competition.

661
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:06,459
Speaker 0: I went and watched a bunch of the advanced Wars content.

662
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:09,760
Speaker 0: These dudes suck at advanced Wars.

663
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:13,930
Speaker 0: Yeah Like I might be one of the best advanced Wars players in the world.

664
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,420
Speaker 0: probably I'm pretty because I got so I can't like I didn't.

665
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:19,845
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna mod my DS So I just have an emulator.

666
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:27,500
Speaker 0: so I had to go get a save file that had everything unlocked And the save file I found on the internet is like super master s-rank everything.

667
00:44:28,561 --> 00:44:32,295
Speaker 0: I think almost all my s-ranks are way higher than the save file.

668
00:44:32,355 --> 00:44:37,092
Speaker 1: even so save file Shouldn't the save file just be hacked like nine nine nine nine nine nine scores.

669
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:39,140
Speaker 0: It's just a regular legit save file.

670
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:41,400
Speaker 0: Okay, I didn't find any hacked ones.

671
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:50,427
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone cared enough to hack one But the actual save files on all my advanced Wars cartridges are way better than the save files I have found online so far.

672
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:50,869
Speaker 0: All right.

673
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,025
Speaker 1: So anyway, I'm also Streaming stuff.

674
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:55,112
Speaker 0: It's not streaming a lot of stuff.

675
00:44:55,132 --> 00:45:00,240
Speaker 1: I say you play in the woods I'm just streaming whatever right like whatever, you know, I don't have like a plan.

676
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,902
Speaker 1: I'm just sort of like.

677
00:45:00,922 --> 00:45:01,364
Speaker 1: you know what.

678
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:03,372
Speaker 1: I got something to make a video of.

679
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:04,496
Speaker 1: it's like lunchtime and I.

680
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:09,055
Speaker 0: your undertale stream was Hard to watch though because you didn't really get how the game worked and then you quit.

681
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:10,080
Speaker 1: What do you mean is RPG?

682
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,539
Speaker 0: Why'd you kill your mom the goat mom?

683
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,822
Speaker 1: Why not?

684
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:15,552
Speaker 0: So you just killing people?

685
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:16,296
Speaker 1: What's wrong with that?

686
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:17,020
Speaker 0: You can kill people.

687
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,924
Speaker 0: It's just a very different game.

688
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,040
Speaker 1: If you do that, you see when I put this thing, I'm playing an RPG, right?

689
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:23,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm only interested in like seeing what the deal is.

690
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:32,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and I could tell this game is going for something like oh it wants me to either You know kill all the people or not kill all the people right, but I'm like, you know what?

691
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,940
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna do whatever makes me go ahead in the game fastest.

692
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:35,905
Speaker 0: You can do that too.

693
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,920
Speaker 0: And actually you'll get different endings and different stuff happens depending on who you kill.

694
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:41,180
Speaker 1: I just want to get through this game as quickly as possible.

695
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:51,680
Speaker 1: So I'm and I got to that lady and it's like, okay The way there might be some way to beat this without using the attack part But it's pain in the ass to figure that out and I don't give a shit.

696
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,835
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna use the fight part and get this over with.

697
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:56,706
Speaker 0: what's really funny Is that the over and over with quickly.

698
00:45:56,726 --> 00:46:01,859
Speaker 0: the overarching theme of the game is that people will do exactly what you did.

699
00:46:03,563 --> 00:46:04,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, just want to get this shit over.

700
00:46:04,537 --> 00:46:06,005
Speaker 0: Yep That is the plot of the game.

701
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:10,434
Speaker 0: people who think like you in the game and play the game that way that is literally the plot.

702
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:13,528
Speaker 0: The game only takes like six hours like it's really quick.

703
00:46:14,251 --> 00:46:15,255
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm playing that again.

704
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:16,600
Speaker 0: Hi, it's so quick.

705
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:18,406
Speaker 0: How could this take?

706
00:46:18,546 --> 00:46:21,637
Speaker 1: you didn't even use a garbage piece of software and I didn't give a shit.

707
00:46:21,858 --> 00:46:22,420
Speaker 0: it just worked.

708
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,152
Speaker 1: I just played like unlike Prince of Nothing.

709
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:25,018
Speaker 1: I don't care what happens.

710
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,224
Speaker 0: How about night in the woods?

711
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:27,389
Speaker 0: Cuz I'm gonna play that real soon.

712
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:29,438
Speaker 1: night in the woods is actually it's.

713
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:33,420
Speaker 1: I mean It's not some kind of masterpiece, but it is as a piece of software.

714
00:46:33,663 --> 00:46:36,062
Speaker 1: It is has tiny flaws But not like.

715
00:46:36,102 --> 00:46:37,546
Speaker 1: it's a very well-made game.

716
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:40,674
Speaker 1: the controller connected and disconnected and reconnect.

717
00:46:40,694 --> 00:46:41,978
Speaker 0: see all these simple games.

718
00:46:42,078 --> 00:46:43,989
Speaker 0: because I strained them I just played them on my keyboard.

719
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:45,280
Speaker 0: I didn't even try to make a controller work.

720
00:46:45,622 --> 00:46:50,472
Speaker 1: Probably be a lot better actually to play night in the woods with the keyboard instead of a gamepad But I can play it on the couch.

721
00:46:50,492 --> 00:46:51,420
Speaker 1: So I don't want to use a keyboard.

722
00:46:51,581 --> 00:47:00,085
Speaker 0: I mean I because I wonder tale like because the platforming part like all the fighting Way easy if you just use arrow keys May play like DDR.

723
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:02,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are certain rhythm parts in night in the woods.

724
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:04,320
Speaker 1: That would be way easier with arrow keys.

725
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,600
Speaker 0: I'll probably play it on a keyboard.

726
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would I would suggest that.

727
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:16,664
Speaker 1: but yeah, I'm playing with a gamepad which is some parts are bad But other the platforming parts are better with the gamepad, but seriously I wish I was streaming right now because I've noticed something.

728
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:33,637
Speaker 0: now that we have the patreon and we have the podcast and the forum and the YouTube streams there are people who are fans of us because they saw us at a con and they want they subscribe to our YouTube channel and They just noticed like after years of fandom like recently.

729
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:35,665
Speaker 0: Oh shit You guys do a party, you know this.

730
00:47:35,946 --> 00:47:39,158
Speaker 1: every panel the first and last thing we say at every time.

731
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:43,424
Speaker 0: I'm Scott Shit Like I could.

732
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:50,500
Speaker 0: people are asking me questions in the YouTube channel that imply that they literally have no idea We have ever done a podcast.

733
00:47:51,483 --> 00:47:54,373
Speaker 1: We just said it at the beginning and end of every panel.

734
00:47:54,614 --> 00:47:56,843
Speaker 1: We're just weren't listening to the words We were saying.

735
00:47:57,064 --> 00:48:04,720
Speaker 0: so I'm saying this now because if you listen if you like subscribe to us on iTunes And that is your only interaction and you don't know that we do any other things.

736
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,463
Speaker 1: We are put.

737
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:07,191
Speaker 1: we put stuff all over the internet.

738
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:09,260
Speaker 0: type the word geek nights into Google.

739
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:10,752
Speaker 0: I feel like that should imagine.

740
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,800
Speaker 1: imagine a globe.

741
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:17,580
Speaker 1: There's the internet and then there's us too and we took some buckets of garbage and we just poured them all over that globe.

742
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:20,299
Speaker 1: There's no part of the globe that is untouched by us.

743
00:48:20,641 --> 00:48:27,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I like type the word geek nights into Google and there's a ton of crap everywhere and no one else.

744
00:48:27,484 --> 00:48:35,933
Speaker 0: the only other thing that uses that word violating our common law trademark is like this semi Defunct group of nerds who meet occasionally in London.

745
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:44,859
Speaker 1: I think I think it's Oxford ox Oxford geek night and occasionally people use the geek night's hashtag just because they're having like a nerdy good old time and they're like Whoa, it's a geek night.

746
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,540
Speaker 1: Yep, like oh, we're gonna play some.

747
00:48:47,721 --> 00:48:50,293
Speaker 0: Oh, no at this point actually we've even pushed those fuckers off.

748
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:54,792
Speaker 0: if you google geek nights We are 100% of the first page of results.

749
00:48:55,173 --> 00:49:04,100
Speaker 0: Mmm, and nope The Northampton geek nights number 19 from May 10th is in the middle of the second page of results.

750
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:15,259
Speaker 0: So I am amazed that people like you exist and you should like look at our other stuff because if you Listen to this you'd probably like our other stuff a lot more.

751
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:20,680
Speaker 0: So speaking of games we played a lot over the years and just never reviewed.

752
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:24,333
Speaker 1: I think I really think you're deleting episodes and so we can do it.

753
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:25,416
Speaker 0: ideas prove it son.

754
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:26,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go.

755
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:27,002
Speaker 1: I

756
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:42,376
Speaker 0: think our problem is that there's a lot of things that we all we just always assumed we reviewed Because we have talked about them at length or even reviewed them with friends like oh You've never played race for the galaxy and we like talk about it and our brain just takes that and says yeah That was a geek night's episode.

757
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:45,729
Speaker 1: Anyway, so race for the galaxy is one of those board games.

758
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,139
Speaker 1: That is well card game actually sort of tabletop.

759
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,050
Speaker 1: It is one of those like staple games.

760
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:59,154
Speaker 1: that like is cemented itself in the tabletop Board game culture and is like always in every game library.

761
00:49:59,255 --> 00:50:00,258
Speaker 1: Everyone knows how to play.

762
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,203
Speaker 1: it's up there settlers cargosone Dominion.

763
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:06,009
Speaker 1: right race of the galaxy is like up.

764
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,335
Speaker 1: there is one of those games that will always be there.

765
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:09,920
Speaker 0: Yeah bunch of expansions.

766
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:14,366
Speaker 0: There's apps There's role for the galaxy.

767
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:17,137
Speaker 0: that is basically the same game with dice instead of cards.

768
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:17,920
Speaker 1: It's not as good.

769
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:18,844
Speaker 1: I think it's better.

770
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:20,211
Speaker 1: But anyway, I don't think so.

771
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're only talking about race to the galaxy today.

772
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,067
Speaker 0: So it's expansions to a degree.

773
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:24,409
Speaker 1: Yes.

774
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:31,863
Speaker 1: So the deal with race of the galaxy is it's a lot like Puerto Rico actually, yeah, right every round Every.

775
00:50:32,003 --> 00:50:38,304
Speaker 1: instead in Puerto Rico you take turns choosing what's gonna happen like I'm gonna captain and Scott says well I'm gonna crash right.

776
00:50:38,324 --> 00:50:43,660
Speaker 1: so when rim captains he captains super captain because he chose it but everyone else just regular captains.

777
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:49,860
Speaker 1: Right in race of the galaxy Everyone chooses at the same time and people can actually choose the same thing as each other.

778
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you could just choose the same thing over and over again.

779
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:56,240
Speaker 1: But if you choose trade you do super trading.

780
00:50:56,501 --> 00:51:02,452
Speaker 1: But now everyone else gets to do regular trading if they also chose trading Because two people might choose the same thing.

781
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:03,640
Speaker 1: Everyone could choose the same thing.

782
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it's panty ass when that happens.

783
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:12,160
Speaker 1: anyone who chooses does super version of that task But everyone else gets to do regular version.

784
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,020
Speaker 1: So sometimes you get to do everything because everyone chose something different and sometimes you don't get to do very much because everyone chose.

785
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:25,520
Speaker 0: Now that's already a huge Huge difference from Puerto Rico because in Puerto Rico I choose a role and then the next player.

786
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,475
Speaker 0: So Scott knows what I chose can't choose that and decides based on.

787
00:51:30,676 --> 00:51:37,660
Speaker 0: so every role you choose Informs the decisions but also restricts the decisions of all the further player in race of the galaxy.

788
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,408
Speaker 1: You're trying to guess who I want.

789
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:42,200
Speaker 1: I really need trading to happen, but I don't want to pick it.

790
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,528
Speaker 1: I know the benefit of picking trading.

791
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,171
Speaker 0: you have to pick.

792
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:46,435
Speaker 0: you can't trade unless you pick it.

793
00:51:46,756 --> 00:51:47,479
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right, right, okay.

794
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,226
Speaker 1: I really want to settle right now.

795
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:52,720
Speaker 1: All right, but the benefit of settling is only a minor benefit.

796
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,529
Speaker 1: It's like a one discount or something, right?

797
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, like.

798
00:51:55,052 --> 00:51:56,017
Speaker 1: I don't need the discount.

799
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:58,811
Speaker 1: I'm good I just need to but I do want to settle.

800
00:51:59,313 --> 00:52:05,920
Speaker 1: so I want settling to happen But I really don't want to have to play settle because it would also be nice to produce happen this turn.

801
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,607
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to use and I hope that Jojo explores rim gonna produce.

802
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:13,473
Speaker 1: if he produces then I can just settle.

803
00:52:13,493 --> 00:52:18,920
Speaker 1: I need to settle if he produces But if he's I think he's gonna settle which is great.

804
00:52:19,141 --> 00:52:22,680
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna produce and then you really hope you can guess what other people gonna do it.

805
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,380
Speaker 1: This psychological element is the number one fun great thing about race of the guy.

806
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:34,865
Speaker 0: I played a game that I remember to this day where the game started and in the first two rounds Nobody picked.

807
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:36,452
Speaker 1: settle everyone picks explore.

808
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:42,960
Speaker 0: in the early everyone picked explore Develop predict like other stuff to two times in a row except military guy.

809
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,646
Speaker 0: So event even military guy.

810
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:45,650
Speaker 0: so eventually.

811
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:49,448
Speaker 0: so two rounds of bad drive military guy No one has settled.

812
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:58,591
Speaker 0: like couple people built like a development Mm-hmm, and everyone assumes now because everyone's got a pile of cards in their hands It's up one jerk that someone's gonna pick settle.

813
00:52:59,213 --> 00:52:59,915
Speaker 0: No one picks it.

814
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:01,200
Speaker 0: No one picks it.

815
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,725
Speaker 1: It kept trying to mooch off someone else.

816
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:07,460
Speaker 0: We went six rounds where no one picked.

817
00:53:08,082 --> 00:53:10,229
Speaker 1: Well your hands really shitty or what?

818
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,760
Speaker 0: well people like people do developments instead, okay or other stuff.

819
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,984
Speaker 0: But no one settled.

820
00:53:15,024 --> 00:53:16,649
Speaker 0: no worlds were put out.

821
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:22,919
Speaker 0: on the seventh round everyone pick settle everyone Except one person picked settle the smart a winner.

822
00:53:25,442 --> 00:53:29,080
Speaker 0: But that happens a lot and that is a big fun part of this game the other part of this game.

823
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:32,500
Speaker 1: But that and it's the most like there's a whole bunch of other stuff going on in the game.

824
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:39,445
Speaker 1: but that Aspect of that word that part beginning of the term where you choose what you're gonna do and you're trying to guess what the other People are gonna choose.

825
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:50,893
Speaker 1: that is like more than 50% of the fun Strategy and quality in this game and that's why it's fun to play over and over and over and over and over again Just doing that thing over and over again.

826
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:51,497
Speaker 1: It's so great.

827
00:53:51,819 --> 00:53:53,907
Speaker 1: Yep I don't get I don't get tired of that aspect.

828
00:53:53,987 --> 00:54:05,900
Speaker 0: and the game is if you look at if you never played it before it looks Terrifyingly Bullshitty complex like it looks like the most ridiculous Nonsense game that you will do anything to avoid playing with some guy at a time.

829
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,140
Speaker 1: The thing is this game isn't actually that complex as far as games go.

830
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,316
Speaker 1: It is come to complex for a complete beginner, but it is not as things go.

831
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:15,862
Speaker 1: It's not advanced squad leader It's not.

832
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:17,450
Speaker 1: even it's easier than Eclipse.

833
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:19,722
Speaker 1: It's easier than a lot of games Right, like.

834
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:22,940
Speaker 0: it's a game that it takes forever to teach someone who's never played games before right?

835
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,780
Speaker 0: But once you start playing by like two rounds and they're like, oh, right.

836
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:41,040
Speaker 1: So the main thing is that the cards have so much information on them But the information is coded in all these various symbols and what the symbols mean isn't really that crazy But you have to learn to read the symbols maybe and the graphic design.

837
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,380
Speaker 1: It's like maybe you could do better to make the learning easier, but I can't imagine a way you could.

838
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,250
Speaker 0: I think they've done it as good as they can.

839
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:52,360
Speaker 0: some of these symbols are shockingly complex But if you really look at them, they actually make a lot of sense.

840
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:55,996
Speaker 1: Once you look up what a symbol means you're like, oh, that's what that does.

841
00:54:56,036 --> 00:54:56,960
Speaker 1: that makes perfect sense.

842
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,260
Speaker 0: Trade any good for one victory point and one card.

843
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,760
Speaker 1: Right, it's like oh it makes perfect sense.

844
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:07,280
Speaker 1: So you get to learn to read these symbols and that makes getting into the game a little bit difficult.

845
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:14,411
Speaker 1: The first times you play it you're gonna be constantly like looking at the book and asking people who know Like what does this card do?

846
00:55:14,451 --> 00:55:15,480
Speaker 1: What does that symbol mean?

847
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,480
Speaker 0: I mean the summary card that comes with the game looks terrifying.

848
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:28,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least there is a summary card which helps you out, right but Once you learn to read the symbols You don't need the summary card anymore.

849
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:31,860
Speaker 1: The game is almost strangely like a solitaire thing, right?

850
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:42,520
Speaker 1: Yeah There's you interact at that fun part that I mentioned the good part where you choose the role that you're gonna do that turn or the activity Whatever the action and that's the interactive part with the other players.

851
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:51,952
Speaker 1: But other than that like once everyone chooses an action everyone just sort of goes Okay, and does their own thing Yeah and like you don't even might not even be paying attention to what the other people are doing.

852
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:53,378
Speaker 1: you should because then you learn how to.

853
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:58,488
Speaker 0: you know You can pay vague attention like Scott played another green Windfall world.

854
00:55:58,569 --> 00:55:58,892
Speaker 0: Okay.

855
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:01,710
Speaker 0: Oh Joey Jojo got a more military.

856
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,353
Speaker 0: I better watch out.

857
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:03,800
Speaker 0: He might try to end the game quicker, right?

858
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:14,098
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, you don't have to like super, you know normally in a game Everyone does their turn and says everything they're doing and you see every action they do and the next person goes and race.

859
00:56:14,399 --> 00:56:19,004
Speaker 1: you can Play fast when everyone knows they're doing because everyone just sort of does their own shit Simultaneously.

860
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:20,852
Speaker 1: and then you can sort of look at stuff.

861
00:56:20,872 --> 00:56:21,917
Speaker 1: You can look at everyone's boards.

862
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:22,580
Speaker 1: They're all public.

863
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,080
Speaker 1: You can very similar to see what they did.

864
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,100
Speaker 1: You just need to look at their board state to get all the information you need to make your own decisions.

865
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,779
Speaker 0: It's actually very similar among skilled players to how seven wonders tends to play out.

866
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, you you know you pass.

867
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:38,720
Speaker 1: you look at other people's boards to say, okay, I'll pick this card.

868
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:42,734
Speaker 1: But then once your turn happens like I'm building this I'm taking these points.

869
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:43,295
Speaker 1: Here's money.

870
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:43,938
Speaker 1: Here's money.

871
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:44,620
Speaker 1: Give me money.

872
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,060
Speaker 0: Okay, yep, but the symbology of this game is way better than seven wonders.

873
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, seven wonders does have that similar problem to learn the language of the symbols.

874
00:56:52,963 --> 00:57:03,652
Speaker 1: But I find that in seven wonders I have to keep looking things up every time I play hardly because there's too many mechanics that are really weird Especially when he had all the expansion in race of the galaxy.

875
00:57:03,672 --> 00:57:09,319
Speaker 1: They just sort of combining the same Symbolic language over and over and cards that need it just have words on them.

876
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of the fancy development cards just have words on them to explain themselves.

877
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,219
Speaker 1: You don't you know, you don't need to look anything up.

878
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,200
Speaker 1: So I do need to look things up when there's new things or an expansion or the few really crazy cards.

879
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,386
Speaker 1: But it's a lot less common than seven wonders.

880
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:26,073
Speaker 1: You start off like ah, these leaders got to look them up.

881
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:27,477
Speaker 1: Yep every time.

882
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:35,770
Speaker 0: now the game Unexpanded is fun, but it's got maybe Maybe 20 plays right before.

883
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:39,204
Speaker 0: the game is complete random nonsense, you know There is.

884
00:57:39,344 --> 00:57:40,490
Speaker 0: you don't make any decisions.

885
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:41,657
Speaker 0: The game is so simple.

886
00:57:41,697 --> 00:57:47,799
Speaker 1: the game Just the core set the race of the galaxy box Doesn't have a lot of cards in it.

887
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:59,180
Speaker 1: So once you have played it a bunch to the point at which you don't need to look up symbols anymore It just gets really repetitive like you're seeing the same cards over and over again, you know exactly what to do on your turn.

888
00:57:59,682 --> 00:58:00,648
Speaker 1: It's sort of previous.

889
00:58:00,688 --> 00:58:08,719
Speaker 1: You're not making interesting decisions anymore Which is why it's good that that exists so that a new player can get into the game easily like that.

890
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:22,045
Speaker 1: But anyone who's played this enough or is it playing it semi seriously or is a somewhat hardcore tabletop gamer like us You have to combine a whole bunch of expansions in there to get a whole bunch of extra cards to mix things up and keep It exciting at the replay value.

891
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:22,367
Speaker 0: Yep.

892
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,514
Speaker 1: It was good because there's a lot of expansions.

893
00:58:24,554 --> 00:58:26,160
Speaker 0: Well, there are two main expansions.

894
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:28,940
Speaker 0: I don't know what other expansions there are because these are the ones that I've played.

895
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,903
Speaker 0: I haven't played anybody.

896
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:35,922
Speaker 1: you want at least these two main ones especially but there are other ones the gathering storm and rebel versus Imperium.

897
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:36,384
Speaker 0: right you.

898
00:58:36,444 --> 00:58:39,574
Speaker 1: now you basically need those like if you're buying this game and you like.

899
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:41,019
Speaker 1: I recommend not buying it.

900
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,868
Speaker 1: if you haven't Played it right play it.

901
00:58:42,948 --> 00:58:47,900
Speaker 1: and if you like it and think you're gonna play it a lot Buy it and those two expansions all together.

902
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:54,820
Speaker 0: Yep Now be warned the expansions add more cards and they've actually made the game way better like especially just gathering storm.

903
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,340
Speaker 0: That's the minimum because that makes the game start way less random.

904
00:58:59,549 --> 00:59:07,500
Speaker 0: Yeah Because once you play the original enough The start the random like what you start with determines the whole game and there's almost no way back from that initial set.

905
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:10,172
Speaker 0: But with gathering storm you have some sort of.

906
00:59:10,192 --> 00:59:14,816
Speaker 0: you can tune what you want to do What strategy you want to go to a small degree when you start the game?

907
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:22,520
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The only real bad expansion I think because there's like some goals and there was one that came out that I haven't played too much.

908
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,695
Speaker 1: They had like a board with alien guys moving around on the board or something, right?

909
00:59:26,715 --> 00:59:30,348
Speaker 0: There's a scenario The in rebel vs.

910
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:42,896
Speaker 0: Imperium that I am not interested in at all And more importantly it adds a mechanic that I think is actually pretty bad Around actually attacking other players and taking their shit.

911
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,838
Speaker 1: Mmm I feel like that that that's not good because then suddenly you can't.

912
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:50,873
Speaker 1: that whole Solitaire element goes away where you start had to really think about what other people are.

913
00:59:50,913 --> 00:59:56,554
Speaker 0: that is just as bad as Carcassonne expansions that let you knock other people's meeples off the board.

914
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:57,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that is bad news.

915
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,676
Speaker 1: so it's like not all the expansions for this game are good, but the good thing is that a lot.

916
01:00:02,756 --> 01:00:08,580
Speaker 1: even the bad expansion like The one with the miniature board where guys move Cards, it just has a bunch of cards in it.

917
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:14,238
Speaker 1: so you can buy the expansions and not use all of the rules that they come with and not use all of the garbage in there.

918
01:00:14,258 --> 01:00:20,580
Speaker 1: and Like it's like buying a carcass own expansion and just taking the tiles and not using those like you can buy me about what?

919
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,283
Speaker 1: The tower.

920
01:00:21,303 --> 01:00:21,925
Speaker 0: about the tower.

921
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:23,090
Speaker 0: don't use the tower.

922
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:25,300
Speaker 1: We just added a bunch of tiles to the carcass zone.

923
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,014
Speaker 1: Right, so you can buy race to the galaxy expansion.

924
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:32,900
Speaker 1: You just add a bunch of cards And you're not gonna be able to add all the cards.

925
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,889
Speaker 1: We can even add most of them and get.

926
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:40,771
Speaker 1: mix up your game and get some interesting things happening Without having to use all of the extra weirdo garbage in there.

927
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:45,870
Speaker 0: I guess the most interesting thing about this game I mean we didn't get too much into the mechanics is it's better.

928
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:46,573
Speaker 0: if you just learn.

929
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:48,020
Speaker 1: the mechanics are pretty simple.

930
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,923
Speaker 1: It's like you're basically.

931
01:00:49,224 --> 01:00:51,772
Speaker 1: you're getting cards cards or planets.

932
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:55,685
Speaker 0: cards are also currency Are everything right.

933
01:00:55,745 --> 01:00:56,508
Speaker 1: cards are everything.

934
01:00:56,548 --> 01:01:00,560
Speaker 1: so it's like you want to build this planet that costs for will discard for other cards.

935
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:11,960
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what they are just cards and you hope you draw when you want to draw cards because drawing more cards gives You a more options, but be more currency to actually play some cards that are more expensive, right?

936
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,352
Speaker 1: And then you plan it's produce things so they get goods on them.

937
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:18,820
Speaker 1: some do some don't can turn goods into victory.

938
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:21,652
Speaker 0: Only produce things once when you build them and never again.

939
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:30,640
Speaker 1: planets are military and then there's Developments which do fancy stuff and get victory points and basically all the abilities on these cards enhance your regular abilities.

940
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,752
Speaker 1: So it's like oh this card has a thing that happens when you produce.

941
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:44,342
Speaker 1: so from now on every time produce happens You can do the fancy thing on this card and you're basically upgrading your machine and your machine is made of planets and goods and Development.

942
01:01:44,423 --> 01:01:48,200
Speaker 1: so again like when someone reaches a certain number of cards in front of them.

943
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:48,883
Speaker 0: Well, there's two ways.

944
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:50,993
Speaker 1: the game is over and also in Puerto Rico.

945
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:52,440
Speaker 1: There's an n-race to the galaxy.

946
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:59,741
Speaker 1: There's a pile of victory point shits If you run that out if you run out the chit pile of victory points the game ends and then you see was the highest Score.

947
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:06,398
Speaker 1: so just like the best machine and got the most points and efficiently in the same number of turns.

948
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:10,327
Speaker 0: Yep, and In that aspect it's like it's a race.

949
01:02:10,528 --> 01:02:12,133
Speaker 1: it's a race in strategy.

950
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:22,380
Speaker 0: the strategies of this game are Shockingly similar to the kinds of thinking you do in Puerto Rico as well Mm-hmm, like are you gonna build goods and ship them for victory points?

951
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,229
Speaker 0: Are you gonna build a bunch of fancy planets and developments?

952
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,011
Speaker 0: get your victory points.

953
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:28,360
Speaker 0: that way you can legit win the game.

954
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,480
Speaker 0: Never shipping stuff and you can legit win the game pretty much doing nothing but shipping stuff and just building.

955
01:02:35,861 --> 01:02:40,857
Speaker 1: Try to end the game quickly by like military especially just getting planet planet planet planet planet.

956
01:02:40,897 --> 01:02:45,056
Speaker 1: if you get a good draw Yeah, just get fill up the you know, victory point condition and just end.

957
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:47,860
Speaker 1: All right There's a lot of different things you can do in the game deal.

958
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,927
Speaker 1: This is why it's not you have to look at what other people are doing You have to make good decisions.

959
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,540
Speaker 1: and there's also an element that Puerto Rico doesn't have of luck.

960
01:02:57,041 --> 01:03:06,459
Speaker 1: Right if you start with the military world new Sparta and you draw a military world that you can just get right away And then you draw another one that you get you can get right away You can just roll through the game.

961
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:20,599
Speaker 1: But if you draw a bunch of other kinds of things that military isn't helping you with it's just like you can sit there in Slog where someone else who maybe started with the blue world and draws a bunch of blue worlds to go with it and gets a Hand of full of synergies is gonna take off.

962
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:26,640
Speaker 1: And so even if you're really good at the game You won't win all the time against other people who are good at the game.

963
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:32,984
Speaker 0: And if everyone's good at the game It's a card game like the better you all get at the game the more the randomness Influences the winner.

964
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:36,157
Speaker 1: because the game which is why you want to have more cards.

965
01:03:36,238 --> 01:03:39,679
Speaker 1: because then Even though you think more cards to make it more random it does.

966
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:43,611
Speaker 1: But more cards also means there's more cards to go around.

967
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:49,170
Speaker 1: so it's not like oh you got the only thing that I Needed to win because there's only one of those in the game.

968
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,013
Speaker 1: It's like oh now.

969
01:03:50,054 --> 01:03:51,580
Speaker 1: There's a huge fucking deck of cards.

970
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,650
Speaker 1: There's gonna be some other cards.

971
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,599
Speaker 1: I can get even if someone took those ones.

972
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,008
Speaker 1: But I'm not just getting blood skilled players.

973
01:03:58,048 --> 01:04:01,140
Speaker 0: that random is a big factor partly because the game will be shockingly tight.

974
01:04:01,562 --> 01:04:08,100
Speaker 0: I would say oh yeah ten to twenty percent of all the games I play this have at least two players who are tied at the end of the game.

975
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,802
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if people are really who know what they're doing are playing Properly.

976
01:04:11,862 --> 01:04:14,174
Speaker 0: in fact you guys are really really close.

977
01:04:14,215 --> 01:04:15,260
Speaker 0: I was playing the Apple.

978
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,649
Speaker 0: I was pooping a four-player game against the hardest AI.

979
01:04:18,051 --> 01:04:20,300
Speaker 0: it was a four-way perfect tie.

980
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,687
Speaker 0: Like that happens in this game.

981
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:26,628
Speaker 1: shockingly often even that you think it's like it's so complex all the shit You're doing.

982
01:04:26,689 --> 01:04:31,540
Speaker 1: all over the place Everyone's doing mostly the same actions because they're all sharing the action.

983
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:38,673
Speaker 1: Oh, and you're drawn from the same decks And you're taking the same exact number of turns So the same number of victory points per turn.

984
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:43,840
Speaker 1: on average you can get ties Even though you have these complex machines being built if everyone's doing a good job.

985
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:51,994
Speaker 0: But the game is also so tight that like if you have one again skilled players if you have one turn We're like you did a suboptimal thing like you're behind now.

986
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:53,018
Speaker 1: You're not gonna catch up.

987
01:04:53,058 --> 01:04:56,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're done You're you're out unless everyone else fucks up bad.

988
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:07,097
Speaker 1: at the same token if you have one mega play like oh my god I somehow managed to build this really amazing development X to trade way early and got like 12 victory points.

989
01:05:07,298 --> 01:05:08,309
Speaker 1: Oh my god I was able.

990
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:19,137
Speaker 1: I was a Traded and sold this good at like this crazy high price and drew a fistful of cards and a turn where no one else Was able to trade anything, you know, and just like whoa, I guess I'm in charge.

991
01:05:19,157 --> 01:05:19,820
Speaker 1: I'm in the lead now.

992
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,164
Speaker 1: Good luck catching up bozos.

993
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:21,565
Speaker 0: Yep.

994
01:05:21,907 --> 01:05:27,526
Speaker 0: This game also kind of pushes the envelope in terms of for a tabletop Card game.

995
01:05:27,627 --> 01:05:30,800
Speaker 0: you play a really fast like it and but it it's fast.

996
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:37,140
Speaker 0: But it also really pushes the limit of the acceptable level of complexity you can have in a game like this.

997
01:05:37,662 --> 01:05:42,260
Speaker 0: It is really surprising how fast it plays considering how complex it is, right?

998
01:05:42,340 --> 01:06:00,497
Speaker 1: It's like you're getting a pretty, you know, it's not super deep But you're getting a significant gaming experience in a short amount of time with a minimal investment of setup because it's just dealing out cards pretty much and counting some chits or whatever, right and That's why this game is a staple of that game

999
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:11,680
Speaker 0: library Right, especially because once you break it out you put it on the table you play it once You can sit there and play it like six more times before you put it away and like just keep play over and over and Over again, it's so quick.

1000
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,066
Speaker 1: And the other thing is it starts out.

1001
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:16,380
Speaker 1: this game will start out when you're first playing it as like the meat game.

1002
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,380
Speaker 1: Right, you'll warm up with a spot it and then go into a race to the galaxy.

1003
01:06:19,581 --> 01:06:24,900
Speaker 1: But once you get good, you can use this as a filler game in between your eclipses, right?

1004
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,948
Speaker 1: It's just like because you can play it so fast.

1005
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:28,997
Speaker 1: Now your filler game is a serious game.

1006
01:06:29,037 --> 01:06:29,459
Speaker 1: It's like whoa.

1007
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,262
Speaker 1: That's pretty.

1008
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,471
Speaker 0: I buy because nursery max is kind of done.

1009
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:37,075
Speaker 0: Like I play I think I've played it a hundred percent out That's but that's another that takes more setup, right?

1010
01:06:37,095 --> 01:06:42,964
Speaker 0: You're not doing the digital Yeah, but now that there's a good app on Android for race for the galaxy this is my pooping game.

1011
01:06:43,606 --> 01:06:48,680
Speaker 0: I can play an entire fully expanded game of this in one poop like as fast as the nursery max.

1012
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,796
Speaker 1: the Next time I need a phone game I think I might buy or see wait for it to be on sale or something.

1013
01:06:52,816 --> 01:06:53,420
Speaker 1: It's totally worth.

1014
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:54,819
Speaker 1: I'll make it my pooping game as well.

1015
01:06:55,263 --> 01:07:04,087
Speaker 0: But the fact that you can play so many games at the table Let me see how much it is right now and I kind of kind of mitigates the randomness because yeah There's a lot of randomness and the game's tight.

1016
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:07,640
Speaker 0: But if we sit down at PAX, we'll play it five times.

1017
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:13,200
Speaker 0: So the better player is gonna win the majority of those games much more likely even if they lose one due to randomness.

1018
01:07:13,702 --> 01:07:15,651
Speaker 0: So this game's got a lot going for it.

1019
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:17,600
Speaker 0: There's a reason it has so much staying power.

1020
01:07:24,045 --> 01:07:26,580
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1029
01:08:21,252 --> 01:08:26,569
Speaker 0: Captain Chinguacu see Rebecca Dunn the terrible secret of space for to one creations.

1030
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:35,890
Speaker 0: The only reason that we set up a red base here is because they have Shervin Von Horrell Rare Laval James David White Rochelle, Monta Nona super boy.

1031
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:41,010
Speaker 0: I paid five bucks to make rim say pickle sailor Vista Matthew Smith Don Shleich.

1032
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:48,071
Speaker 0: It's our topish and Joe sure Joe star Sean Yeager Sam Cordray Clinton Walton Ren from New Zealand Ryan Perrin Mr.

1033
01:08:48,131 --> 01:08:56,729
Speaker 0: Black Brian Cedroni Finn Chris midkiff Chris Knox Daniel Redmond Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

1034
01:08:58,091 --> 01:09:10,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't stream the episode tonight because of an interesting conflict where if I opened OBS It would hang the firewire inputs that the computer was receiving even though the actual channel was fine.

1035
01:09:10,832 --> 01:09:32,788
Speaker 0: I suspect it'll require reboots and futzing with the drivers because Firewires fickle in the modern era and yes I still use firewire because half of the professional audio equipment in the world still uses firewire and I have a very expensive firewire mixer that I don't really want to replace and I have yet to find a good USB equivalent that has the same level of functionality that this thing has.

1036
01:09:33,974 --> 01:09:45,184
Speaker 0: so anyway now I leave you with My.

1037

01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:20,120
Speaker 0: We are one.
