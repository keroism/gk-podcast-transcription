1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,575
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, July 28th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:15,370
Speaker 1: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights Tonight.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,015
Speaker 1: Horror!

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,048
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,550
Speaker 0: So, when you're biking around, one of the necessary accessories is the bottle of water.

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,700
Speaker 1: Bottle of water?

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,250
Speaker 1: Or the CamelBak.

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,390
Speaker 0: Well, the CamelBak is for a long bike.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,490
Speaker 1: No, what you need to do, and I'm ordering a second one, you need one, like, big CamelBak for when you're going on, like, some long journey.

10
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:48,190
Speaker 1: But they also make really little ones that only hold, like, a liter, but they're basically just, like, the best form factor for biking.

11
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,646
Speaker 0: Why would you get only, uh, whatever.

12
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,003
Speaker 0: If I'm only going to work, I only need a bottle of water.

13
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:56,610
Speaker 0: I don't need a CamelBak.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,910
Speaker 1: You can't just hold out that, like, 20 minutes to get to work?

15
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:02,110
Speaker 0: It's good to have water.

16
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:10,770
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, I had this basically really cheapo water bottle from the bike shop that was the cheapest possible water bottle you could get.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,450
Speaker 1: Do you have, uh, PHBs and all that?

18
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,870
Speaker 0: I don't know, but, you know, it was fine.

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,616
Speaker 0: But it was not very well insulated.

20
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:22,350
Speaker 0: You know, the water, if I put an ice cube in it and I walked outside, the ice cube would no longer be an ice cube.

21
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:23,750
Speaker 0: And I was like, ah, that's disappointing.

22
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:26,148
Speaker 0: So, I went on Amazon, like I do.

23
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,490
Speaker 0: Found, and I was looking at the highest rated water bottles that fit in bicycles.

24
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,864
Speaker 0: So, I saw the CamelBak Podium Big Chill 25 ounce, right?

25
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:36,097
Speaker 0: And that's the one I got.

26
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,850
Speaker 0: There were some other ones that looked really good, though.

27
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,600
Speaker 0: There's this bottle called the Clean Bottle.

28
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,405
Speaker 0: Get this, you ready?

29
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:41,250
Speaker 0: Genius.

30
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:44,069
Speaker 0: You can open it from the bottom also to clean it.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,119
Speaker 0: Genius.

32
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,319
Speaker 0: There was also this very popular one.

33
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,510
Speaker 0: It was like the Polar something that was incredibly well insulated.

34
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:57,009
Speaker 0: But I got this CamelBak one because, while it didn't, it was five star rated, just like the Polar one.

35
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:05,850
Speaker 0: But, even though it had less total ratings, but it had some amount of insulation, but not amazing insulation, but some.

36
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:09,350
Speaker 0: And it had, it didn't open on the bottom, obviously.

37
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:16,410
Speaker 0: But, the nozzle on the top, right, it wasn't the usual CamelBak one with the biting, like I have at work at my desk.

38
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:21,550
Speaker 0: It was a kind where water can't get out unless you squeeze it.

39
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,303
Speaker 0: And you can actually twist it to lock it completely.

40
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:25,730
Speaker 0: So, there's no way water can get out.

41
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:31,430
Speaker 0: And actually, that was a problem I had, where like, with the crappy water bottles, you'd hit bumps in the street and water would go psh, psh.

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:31,900
Speaker 1: Really?

43
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:32,383
Speaker 1: Yeah.

44
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,930
Speaker 1: I've never had that happen, even with crappy bottles.

45
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,283
Speaker 0: It's a really crappy bottle.

46
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:36,990
Speaker 0: It's basically open.

47
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,510
Speaker 0: So, this one really closes and water will not come out unless like you suck on it or squeeze it or something.

48
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,790
Speaker 1: It's got like the 50 cent water bottles in any bike store don't leak.

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,607
Speaker 0: This was the 50 cent bottle and it leaks.

50
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,630
Speaker 1: Doesn't it have like the bit that you just bite and like pull open?

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,169
Speaker 0: No, it's not a, yeah, you pull it.

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,685
Speaker 0: And the thing is, when you push it back in to close it, it doesn't 100% close.

53
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,249
Speaker 1: You know, for 50 cents, you could have gotten another one that worked.

54
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:01,316
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

55
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:03,050
Speaker 0: It was mostly for the insulation that I ordered.

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,210
Speaker 1: And you could have wrapped it in some rags.

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I ordered this mostly for the insulation, but you know, the nozzle that was fancy was an added bonus.

58
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,330
Speaker 1: Does this fascinating story go anywhere?

59
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't be setting it up for no reason.

60
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,190
Speaker 1: There's a lot of setups, so there'd better be a lot of payoff.

61
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,470
Speaker 0: So, I went to the post office this morning and there it was, because you know, they gave me the orange slip, the pink slip, whatever.

62
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:23,416
Speaker 0: I got it.

63
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:24,530
Speaker 0: I filled it up with water.

64
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:30,550
Speaker 1: Here's an aside, I had a crazy dream where I moved to an apartment that didn't have a doorman and all my packages disappeared.

65
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:31,166
Speaker 1: Okay.

66
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:32,910
Speaker 1: Like every package that came disappeared.

67
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,680
Speaker 0: So I got it at the post office.

68
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,670
Speaker 0: I filled it up with water.

69
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,770
Speaker 0: The water didn't taste like plastic or anything.

70
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,965
Speaker 0: Even though I didn't even clean the bottle at all.

71
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:40,630
Speaker 0: It was great.

72
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,510
Speaker 0: And then I put ice cubes in it and walked outside and they were still ice cubes.

73
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,769
Speaker 0: I could hear them banging around in there.

74
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,050
Speaker 0: And that little nozzly thing on the top totally worked, not bullshit.

75
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,769
Speaker 0: It's actually really, really cool.

76
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,310
Speaker 1: Did you lose the water bottle?

77
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,409
Speaker 0: The water bottle was too big.

78
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:58,208
Speaker 0: By a little bit.

79
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,509
Speaker 0: It was too big.

80
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,470
Speaker 1: That's the saddest story.

81
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,090
Speaker 0: It was a little too big for, you know, it's basically, it was, it was like one and a half times as long as a usual bike water bottle.

82
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,250
Speaker 0: So I stuck it in there and I was sort of careful on the way to work and it got to work just fine.

83
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:19,470
Speaker 0: But then on the way home from work, it, uh, I was biking.

84
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,510
Speaker 1: Did it fall off and roll like off the Queensborough bridge or something?

85
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:30,330
Speaker 0: I was just, you know, I, I put it, I filled it up at work, put it in the little holder, waited for the elevator, got in the elevator.

86
00:04:30,652 --> 00:04:34,310
Speaker 0: Started biking to work, a bike at home, not even home, bike in here.

87
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,749
Speaker 0: I was biking here.

88
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:39,550
Speaker 0: And then on second Avenue, I looked down and is not there.

89
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,929
Speaker 1: Somebody might've stolen it.

90
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:51,830
Speaker 0: And I, I remembered at one point hearing, like I had a memory of hearing a noise of clunk sploosh, but I don't, I don't know when it could have been in the elevator.

91
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,329
Speaker 0: It could have been at work.

92
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,348
Speaker 0: It might still be at work.

93
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:58,510
Speaker 0: It could have been on 49th street under a car's wheel.

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,489
Speaker 0: It could have been anywhere.

95
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,449
Speaker 0: So it was only 12 bucks.

96
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,110
Speaker 1: Oh, to be fair, if it was clunk sploosh, it clearly was not that airtight.

97
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,770
Speaker 0: It could have been clunk sploosh in the elevator.

98
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,110
Speaker 1: But no, the sploosh is the part I'm pointing out.

99
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,110
Speaker 0: But this is just the memory.

100
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,390
Speaker 0: The memory could be totally wrong.

101
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:15,390
Speaker 1: Are you sure you even bought the water bottle?

102
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:15,910
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

103
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:16,889
Speaker 0: You sure you didn't dream it?

104
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,109
Speaker 0: Here's an Amazon page.

105
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,409
Speaker 0: It says right here, you can see it.

106
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,969
Speaker 0: Instant order update for Scott Rubin.

107
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,885
Speaker 0: You purchased this item on July 20th.

108
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:23,449
Speaker 0: View this order.

109
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:27,130
Speaker 0: So I'm not going to buy that one again because it's too big.

110
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:29,630
Speaker 0: It's even it won't fit at any bike.

111
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,409
Speaker 0: It's too long.

112
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:33,790
Speaker 0: I might just go buy another cheapo one.

113
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:43,927
Speaker 0: But if you need a water bottle and you don't care that it's long or maybe, you know, some, I have the kind of buy a water bottle holder that goes on like the frame in the front.

114
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:48,990
Speaker 0: Some people have the kind you ever see the dual wheeled under the seat bike bottle holders.

115
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:49,345
Speaker 1: Yeah.

116
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:49,890
Speaker 0: Yeah.

117
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,750
Speaker 0: If you have one of those, you know, that's basically more like a cup holder for a car, then two of these will probably be pretty awesome.

118
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:05,427
Speaker 1: My mountain bike, I used to always carry, I had a water bottle thing like on the like upward on the, in the inside of the frame and then another one hanging off the top of the frame for two.

119
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:10,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can do two that way, but this is the ones I've seen in like the behind the seat dual wheeled.

120
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:12,850
Speaker 0: That would definitely be able to hold this motherfucker.

121
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:17,768
Speaker 0: But the other thing is though the installation was not the greatest, right?

122
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,645
Speaker 0: There's other bottles out there that have insulation.

123
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,234
Speaker 0: that is like ridiculous to be amazing.

124
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,144
Speaker 0: Like I've seen insulated bottles so good.

125
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,150
Speaker 0: They're like igloos.

126
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:32,190
Speaker 0: You could put ice in there, leave it in a hot car, come get it out of the hot car after work and they'll still be ice in there.

127
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,070
Speaker 1: So how thick is that insulation?

128
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,490
Speaker 1: How much water usually fit in there with it simultaneously not being too fat to stick in your bike.

129
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:47,608
Speaker 0: Usually those ones are the kind where it's like metal and then air and then insulation and then air and then metal and they're kind of fat.

130
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:53,950
Speaker 1: I honestly don't see the point though because warm water is more pleasant to drink exercising.

131
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,050
Speaker 0: Warm water tastes like you've never exercised.

132
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,388
Speaker 0: Warm water is nasty.

133
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,670
Speaker 0: Who wants to drink warm water?

134
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,800
Speaker 1: So independently I felt kind of stupid.

135
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,590
Speaker 1: I saw some Japanese video the other day.

136
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,965
Speaker 1: It was like how to cool down a hot car.

137
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:09,529
Speaker 0: That was a good video.

138
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,690
Speaker 0: As fast as possible.

139
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,328
Speaker 0: I like that video.

140
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:12,930
Speaker 1: And I thought, all right, what are they going to do?

141
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,568
Speaker 1: Like pour water over it and then he rolls down the passenger side window and I'm like, oh, all right, duh.

142
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:30,089
Speaker 1: And then he opens the driver's side door and slams it shut without opening the window and does it like five times and they demonstrably reduce the temperature by a surprising degree.

143
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you basically just suck all the hot air out and suck all the cold air from outside the car in.

144
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:35,270
Speaker 1: Yeah.

145
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:36,410
Speaker 0: He is the problem though.

146
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,410
Speaker 1: I'm glad that I learned this now in a day when I no longer own a car.

147
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,450
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is that strategy is sort of false, right?

148
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:49,070
Speaker 0: Because yes, it will decrease the air temperature of inside the car and then you can start the air conditioner afterwards and you'll be better off.

149
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,950
Speaker 0: But I really don't have a problem with hot air in the car.

150
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:52,808
Speaker 0: That doesn't bother me.

151
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,769
Speaker 0: Even though it will save you on the air conditioner.

152
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,850
Speaker 1: You're going to complain about the hot seats.

153
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,009
Speaker 0: Hot seats and more importantly, hot buckles that burn your hand when you try to put your seat belt on.

154
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,529
Speaker 0: Hot steering wheels also a problem.

155
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,627
Speaker 1: You get one of those reflective things and put it in the car.

156
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:09,730
Speaker 0: That's preventing the car from getting hot.

157
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:10,670
Speaker 0: Cooling it down.

158
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,704
Speaker 0: That's two different strategies.

159
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you've already failed if you have to cool it down.

160
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,548
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

161
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:23,069
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should do the cool down thing anyway even if you look stupid because the air conditioning will do less work and you'll save gas and such and such.

162
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:31,330
Speaker 1: So I want to talk about this briefly because it's making the rounds and it does kind of involve My Little Pony.

164
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,990
Speaker 0: Great ponies.

165
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:48,010
Speaker 1: A lot of people have been talking and even some semi-legitimate old world journalists about how Hasbro's handling of the My Little Pony franchise is possibly the most powerful argument for expanded fair use laws we have ever seen.

166
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,930
Speaker 1: Because the creative explosion that has come out, like other properties are just as mash-up-able, but because the people...

167
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,409
Speaker 0: Well, it is slightly more conducive to mash-up-ery.

168
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:00,704
Speaker 1: It is, but at the same time...

169
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,610
Speaker 0: Anything live action is slightly less conducive just by its very nature.

170
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:03,812
Speaker 0: But, for

171
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:20,230
Speaker 1: example, shows a lot of things that are on Hulu, especially like Archer, some of these animated shows, are pretty mash-up-able in a similar way, but yet the properties are so locked down and people get shut down for even like sharing anything about them so much that nothing really happens.

172
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,549
Speaker 0: This is why there's articles about ponies on every single site in the universe, even Slashdot, right?

173
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,550
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, Archer, where are there articles about Archer?

174
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,330
Speaker 0: Maybe on Cartoon Brew, that's about it.

175
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,310
Speaker 1: Now, some people have argued that maybe it's just because it's ponies.

176
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:34,766
Speaker 0: No.

177
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,770
Speaker 1: I don't know, the fact that we're watching ponies.

178
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about this.

179
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:41,169
Speaker 0: If a good show... No, not that ponies are a good show.

180
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,669
Speaker 0: But I'm saying, let's say, for example...

181
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,769
Speaker 1: They're on a different continuum.

182
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:54,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's say, for example, that The Simpsons, right, wasn't so jerky about taking all their clips off the internets, right?

183
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,249
Speaker 0: Well, everyone would just be mashing up Simpsons.

184
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,050
Speaker 0: We wouldn't have to resort to mashing up ponies.

185
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,110
Speaker 1: Do you know how often I would post Peter going,

186
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,998
Speaker 1: "Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh?"

187
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,110
Speaker 1: If I could just do that and get away with it without the videos disappearing on me?

188
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:06,643
Speaker 0: I know, right?

189
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,350
Speaker 0: Instead, we used Trollface.

190
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,550
Speaker 1: But it is interesting that My Little Pony was the one.

191
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:15,570
Speaker 1: And Hasbro, in the beginning, had no idea.

192
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,080
Speaker 1: They were just like... Oops.

193
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,486
Speaker 1: As soon as they saw YouTube, they're like,

194
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:19,748
Speaker 1: "What?".

195
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,070
Speaker 1: And there were takedown notices everywhere.

196
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,709
Speaker 1: And then, that stopped.

197
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:28,929
Speaker 1: And the real kicker was when Hasbro started making their own stuff.

198
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:33,790
Speaker 1: that is surprisingly similar to the kinds of things the fans were making.

199
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,370
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not gonna buy any of their shitty toys.

200
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,749
Speaker 1: Not yet, because the toys are shitty.

201
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,430
Speaker 0: But, I will buy a shitty toy under one circumstance.

202
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:44,389
Speaker 1: It's Rainbow Dash.

203
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,470
Speaker 0: No, there's already a shitty Rainbow Dash.

204
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,129
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy that.

205
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,450
Speaker 0: Because two people gave me free shitty Rainbow Dashes.

206
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:57,770
Speaker 0: I will buy a shitty Derpy Hooves, no matter how shitty, just to show them, right, that fair use is a good idea.

207
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,168
Speaker 1: But in general, this is...

208
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,650
Speaker 0: Because what Derpy Hooves symbolizes is worth the money.

209
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:06,190
Speaker 1: Who argue with people who don't get it, or who argue against fair use.

210
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,410
Speaker 1: The ponies are probably a really strong argument you can use against these people.

211
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,550
Speaker 1: Just go on YouTube and find one of those great videos someone's made.

212
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,690
Speaker 0: All this stuff about intellectual property here is old news.

213
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,730
Speaker 0: We've said it a billion times.

214
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,889
Speaker 0: We've been saying it for over a decade.

215
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:28,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only difference is that we have something here right now that is such a great example of why we need better laws.

216
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,390
Speaker 0: There's a better... No, here's a better argument to make, right?

217
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,609
Speaker 0: Here's a better argument to make using this evidence.

218
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,090
Speaker 0: So ponies, fair use, right?

219
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,170
Speaker 0: Because they have gone the fair use route, they're getting way more popular, right?

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,370
Speaker 0: They're making all this extra money off this thing that they otherwise wouldn't, right?

221
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,310
Speaker 0: The fair use is beneficial in the market.

222
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,530
Speaker 1: Ah, but here's the trouble.

223
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,250
Speaker 1: Fair use is so ephemeral and so poorly defined.

224
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:53,809
Speaker 0: Hold on, right?

225
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,003
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, regardless of the law, wouldn't that mean...

226
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,376
Speaker 1: Right, I'm saying...

227
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:11,969
Speaker 0: No, what I'm saying is look, one company has decided to let people go nuts and it's giving them more money.

228
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,944
Speaker 0: Other companies that don't decide to do this are making less money.

229
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:26,350
Speaker 0: So shouldn't the market correct and despite whatever the law is, wouldn't therefore that money encourage more companies to go the Hasbro route?

230
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,549
Speaker 1: I can tell you why not.

231
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:33,250
Speaker 0: More companies have not gone the Hasbro route, which is evidence that the market doesn't really work that way, does it?

232
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,690
Speaker 0: So when people say the invisible hand, well, invisible hand is taking a nap.

233
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:37,509
Speaker 1: I disagree.

234
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,390
Speaker 1: I think it's a little more subtle than that.

235
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,670
Speaker 0: Invisible hand is taking a nap.

236
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,970
Speaker 1: I think what's happening here is that it's a prisoner's dilemma on a mass scale of all the media producers.

237
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,950
Speaker 1: Because what have we always complained about and what a lot of nerds complain about?

238
00:12:50,350 --> 00:13:01,249
Speaker 1: The long tail and all that doesn't really factor into markets because catering to the kind of real market as it exists destroys the market for the things that actually make these companies money now.

239
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,350
Speaker 0: You've got to do both at the same time.

240
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:04,430
Speaker 0: It's not that hard.

241
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,350
Speaker 1: No, it is because what is popular?

242
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:21,238
Speaker 1: Things that tend to be pushed onto people and tend to be marketed in a certain way and then the restrictions on use and then the selling of products, they make more money from that than they would make with the fair use in the long run if everything was fair use.

243
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:31,590
Speaker 1: because that kind of -- it's kind of like Nintendo where if you drive the price down where people are more willing to pay a dollar for Angry Birds than $40 for two Angry Birds on the DS.

244
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:32,930
Speaker 0: You don't understand.

245
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:43,910
Speaker 0: There is an easy way to do it where you can hit the nerds and get all their monies and you can also hit the normal people and get the normal people monies at the same time.

246
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,830
Speaker 1: Let all non-commercial use just flourish on the internet.

247
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,393
Speaker 0: Right.

248
00:13:47,413 --> 00:14:04,510
Speaker 0: For example, Apple could enable -- just add one check box deep in the settings that says enable sideload and every nerd would use an iPhone because they could get all the user interface and load whatever apps they want without jailbreaking and no normal person would ever do that or figure out how to do it.

249
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,950
Speaker 0: and they would continue to dump all their money into the app store and Apple would get both markets.

250
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,690
Speaker 0: They would have the nerds and the normal people.

251
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,850
Speaker 1: And look at what Hasbro is doing.

252
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,010
Speaker 1: They're making nods toward this fan base.

253
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:18,390
Speaker 1: They're letting all this awesome fair use just kind of happen.

254
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:28,070
Speaker 0: They let We Love Fine license pony t-shirts and they're making pony t-shirts for bronies and they also make pony coloring books in Target at the same time.

255
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:29,654
Speaker 0: And you know what?

256
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:34,050
Speaker 0: Some of the nerds still buy the normal shit even though they know it's shitty.

257
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,209
Speaker 0: It's this weird thing that nerds do.

258
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:40,886
Speaker 0: They'll go for the nerdy thing that only nerds want, like a $500 statue.

259
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,338
Speaker 1: But not even a statue.

260
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,589
Speaker 1: It's usually just a bust.

261
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:46,710
Speaker 0: Here is a perfect example.

262
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:48,230
Speaker 0: So you have Spider-Man.

263
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,689
Speaker 0: Spider-Man appeals to the masses and also to the nerds.

264
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,230
Speaker 0: The comic books, only nerds will buy those.

265
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,069
Speaker 0: Spider-Man movie, normal people see it.

266
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,590
Speaker 0: Nerd also goes to see Spider-Man movie.

267
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:02,010
Speaker 0: Even if it's a shitty one, Spider-Man fan can't help but go to it.

268
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,870
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that Spider-Man fan does not go to turn off the dark.

269
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,698
Speaker 0: No, maybe he does.

270
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,170
Speaker 0: There's actually a lot of people go to see it.

271
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:12,485
Speaker 1: I think only tourists go to see it.

272
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:15,020
Speaker 0: A lot of people go to see it.

273
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,369
Speaker 0: I don't know why they do, but they do.

274
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:18,489
Speaker 1: Everybody else knows better, but the tourists don't know.

275
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:25,130
Speaker 0: The point is you can hit both markets, but if you push out the nerd market... This is where I want to get back to my point.

276
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:29,110
Speaker 1: If I hit both markets, that's fine.

277
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:40,469
Speaker 1: If everybody hits both markets, fast forward a generation or two, and the free, fair use nerd market becomes mainstream because everybody else starts to catch up.

278
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,615
Speaker 0: No, I see.

279
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,330
Speaker 0: It won't cause that to happen.

280
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,830
Speaker 0: That is an inevitability.

281
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,250
Speaker 1: I don't think it is, because people are too easily manipulated.

282
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:59,590
Speaker 0: I think it's an inevitability, and if you don't go for both markets now, then you stay in the mainstream market, then when that happens, when the free use nerd market is the only market, you'll have nothing.

283
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,810
Speaker 0: You have to hit both now, that way you'll be prepared for the nerd-only future.

284
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:13,510
Speaker 1: I think the media companies actually believe that they can keep the free culture as a sideline and hide it from the masses forever.

285
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,075
Speaker 0: Can't do it.

286
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:15,709
Speaker 0: It's going to break out.

287
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,270
Speaker 1: Let me look at YouTube already.

288
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,539
Speaker 0: It's already breaking out.

289
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:19,447
Speaker 0: The other thing...

290
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:26,630
Speaker 1: Look in the '80s, '90s, shows like Getting Hit in the Nuts, Home Video, anything like that, Bob Saget.

291
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,430
Speaker 1: Shows like that were very popular.

292
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:38,930
Speaker 1: And now, even your mom is going to watch videos of people getting hit in the nuts on YouTube rather than watch a TV show where there's ads and then occasional nut shots.

293
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,689
Speaker 0: Only grandma will watch nut shots on TV.

294
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
Speaker 1: But even grandmas will find out about YouTube.

295
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:46,629
Speaker 0: There are some grandmas who can watch nut shots on YouTube, but most of them watch nut shots on TV.

296
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,590
Speaker 1: They used to say that porn was the driver of technology.

297
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,730
Speaker 1: I don't think that's true anymore.

298
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,990
Speaker 0: It's always funny when we're in a hotel and the news is showing YouTube videos.

299
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,550
Speaker 1: That happens a lot.

300
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:57,790
Speaker 1: Even CNBC, it's kind of amazing.

301
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,146
Speaker 0: Or they'll read tweets out loud on the TV.

302
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,099
Speaker 1: I put forth a new supposition.

303
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,770
Speaker 1: Forget porn driving the industry, I don't think that exists anymore.

304
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,410
Speaker 1: I will argue that nut shots follow the real industry now.

305
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:20,989
Speaker 1: If you just follow where people get videos of cute animals and people getting hit in the nuts, wherever that is going, that is like the bulge ahead of the curve of the next trend of where people consume media.

306
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:30,229
Speaker 0: The other thing is that even if, you know, there's always, you know, the dual market will still last for quite a while before the nerd market takes over the whole show.

307
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,913
Speaker 1: I mean, look, music.

308
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:36,970
Speaker 1: The music industry is still holding on to the bitter end and still hasn't disappeared.

309
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:43,530
Speaker 0: Allowing the nerd market to go instead of fighting it is basically, you're basically saying no to free marketing, right?

310
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:53,890
Speaker 0: How much has the non nerd pony market audience expanded because of the marketing influence and the, you know, the promoting of the nerds?

311
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:56,901
Speaker 0: And it's not even just directly due to like.

312
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,050
Speaker 0: I saw a funny pony video on YouTube.

313
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,790
Speaker 0: Therefore, I became a pony fan.

314
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,790
Speaker 0: There was nerds made funny pony videos.

315
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,610
Speaker 0: So magazines wrote articles about ponies that normal people read.

316
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,450
Speaker 1: Magazines?

317
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

318
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,858
Speaker 0: But that's what normal people do.

319
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,250
Speaker 0: is they read magazines, you know.

320
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:21,450
Speaker 0: So it's like because the nerds are fair using the ponies, the ponies get into the mainstream media more than they otherwise would have.

321
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:28,470
Speaker 0: Thus increasing, you know, the other audience that, you know, you know, this allows other kind of market.

322
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,490
Speaker 1: Look at what Apple does with their apps.

323
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:34,330
Speaker 1: They'll let people make apps or submit apps that they won't accept.

324
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:41,050
Speaker 1: But if an app gets popular that adds some sort of core functionality, they'll basically just steal it and do it themselves.

325
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:47,749
Speaker 1: And companies that do this stuff with the nerd market and let the nerd fair use market thrive can do the same thing.

326
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,810
Speaker 1: Whoa, Derpy Hooves is popular.

327
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,509
Speaker 1: Going to sell me a Derpy Hooves t-shirt.

328
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,910
Speaker 1: Someone made a funny comic that's really popular.

329
00:18:56,432 --> 00:18:59,310
Speaker 1: I'm going to hire people to make a similar comic and sell it overseas.

330
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:00,701
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

331
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:10,970
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's interesting that this is that pony, of all the things it could have been that are pushing the fair use argument into mainstream media, it just happened to be the ponies.

332
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:11,545
Speaker 0: Yep.

333
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:14,250
Speaker 0: I didn't do any news at all.

334
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:14,807
Speaker 1: You can go.

335
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:15,444
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

336
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:16,369
Speaker 1: I didn't stop anything.

337
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,235
Speaker 0: I heard you clicking.

338
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:19,110
Speaker 0: It sounded like you were making a move.

339
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,689
Speaker 0: So I want to be talking about, you know, this should be saved for Tuesday news, but it's too big.

340
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,248
Speaker 0: I want to talk about Nintendo fans.

341
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:27,399
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

342
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,029
Speaker 1: Interesting.

343
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,809
Speaker 1: This is the first Nintendo portable that neither of us bought the day it came out.

344
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, since the Game Boy Color.

345
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:40,670
Speaker 0: I bought Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, DS, pretty much those three on the day they came out.

346
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,870
Speaker 0: All the SPs, DS lights, they don't count.

347
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,110
Speaker 1: I didn't get a Game Boy at first, but not because I didn't want one, because my mom wouldn't buy me one that soon.

348
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,390
Speaker 0: My brother got a Game Boy Pocket.

349
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,430
Speaker 1: I got a Game Gear before I got a Game Boy.

350
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,750
Speaker 0: Anyway, I never had the Game Boy Game Boy.

351
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,869
Speaker 0: Wow, I had the Game Boy-- My brother had the Game Boy Pocket and I had the Game Boy Color, but our friends had a Game Boy Game Boy that I played a lot.

352
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,510
Speaker 1: Wow, my brother had the Game Boy Game Boy and I had the Game Gear, and we'd trade back and forth.

353
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,863
Speaker 0: Anyway, so if you don't know the news, basically the 3DS, not to look so good.

354
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:14,410
Speaker 0: So they're dropping the price down to 180, which is from 250.

355
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,650
Speaker 1: That's way early for Nintendo to do something like that.

356
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:24,269
Speaker 1: Nintendo never drops the price that early on anything, which means-- But yet they're dropping the price, but the first party good games people are waiting for aren't even out yet.

357
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:29,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they should have kept the price up and put the games out, then maybe some people would have bought it, right?

358
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,470
Speaker 0: Games are the reason people aren't buying it.

359
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,130
Speaker 1: But the thing is, the games, I don't even trust Nintendo to make the games I want anymore.

360
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,140
Speaker 0: No kidding.

361
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,030
Speaker 0: And they're not on the horizon.

362
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,630
Speaker 1: To this day, what are the games I would play?

363
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,750
Speaker 0: That's why I'm still not going to buy it for 180, because still the only reason I'm not buying it is because there's no advance orders.

364
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,590
Speaker 1: Right now, Scott, there's four people in this apartment.

365
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:55,690
Speaker 1: If I was going to play a Nintendo game in rough order, I would play Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, Advance Wars, Four Swords.

366
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, Four Swords, maybe Mario Tenies, Mario Soccer.

367
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:05,830
Speaker 0: I think they announced Mario Kart 7, which is weird, because there's more than seven Mario Karts already existing.

368
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,069
Speaker 1: Brawl, I would play right now, maybe.

369
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,713
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

370
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,847
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the point is, they're lowering the price because 3DS, not to look so good.

371
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:13,150
Speaker 0: Okay.

372
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,989
Speaker 0: This isn't going to help.

373
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,330
Speaker 0: What if you paid $250?

374
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,182
Speaker 0: Now it's like, "What the fuck,

375
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:17,688
Speaker 0: Nintendo?".

376
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:24,030
Speaker 0: They're giving you a consolation prize, which is actually, admittedly, a lot of virtual console games.

377
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,724
Speaker 0: They're giving you a pile of virtual console games, both GBA and NES, real ones.

378
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:43,109
Speaker 1: See, good on them, because Nintendo, for all its Japanese sensibility as a company, that is a very Japanese thing to do, to be like, basically apologize to the people who didn't get, basically who got screwed by you realizing that you fucked up.

379
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is I wonder, right?

380
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,023
Speaker 1: Sony would never do anything like that.

381
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:48,810
Speaker 1: They just dropped the price.

382
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, Sony, they gave everyone one lousy game for the PSN out of it.

383
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,569
Speaker 1: Microsoft, or just flip you off?

384
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:54,352
Speaker 0: Yeah.

385
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,308
Speaker 0: I don't know.

386
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:56,590
Speaker 0: Maybe.

387
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,110
Speaker 0: Microsoft is kind of iffy what they would do.

388
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,388
Speaker 1: No, they would-- They're moody.

389
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,310
Speaker 1: They wouldn't drop the price because the price would have been already artificially low.

390
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,874
Speaker 0: That's right.

391
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:06,923
Speaker 0: That's what I was going to say.

392
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,030
Speaker 0: They dropped the price from $250 to $170, $180.

393
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,823
Speaker 0: Does that mean that they were making a $70 profit and a $170 is still profitable?

394
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,749
Speaker 1: Or are they going at a loss now?

395
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:17,959
Speaker 0: Or are they going at a loss now?

396
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,410
Speaker 0: Because they were definitely at a profit before.

397
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:27,530
Speaker 1: Now, if I were them, way from the beginning, I would have gone with the Razer model and I would have given up on the philosophy of making money on every console.

398
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:34,030
Speaker 1: I would have sold the 3DS cheap and I would have really pushed the downloadable content for money, microtransactions.

399
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,850
Speaker 0: Right, but the problem is their downloadable content is too much money.

400
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,816
Speaker 1: Oh, I would have made it cheap.

401
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,990
Speaker 1: I would have made it like a dollar for an NES game.

402
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,370
Speaker 0: Right, so here's the other problem.

403
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,670
Speaker 0: They're giving you a fistful of virtual console games.

404
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:44,354
Speaker 0: But you know what?

405
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:50,270
Speaker 0: I have a piracy card in my regular DS that is every NES, every SNES, a ton of GBA, and a ton of DS games.

406
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,830
Speaker 1: Never mind the fact that anyone with a PSP.

407
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,139
Speaker 0: And every Game Boy game ever.

408
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,590
Speaker 0: And every Game Boy Color game ever.

409
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,689
Speaker 0: PSP people can do the same piracy.

410
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,729
Speaker 0: Right, so here's what I would have done if I was Nintendo.

411
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,409
Speaker 0: Right, which they would never do in a million years.

412
00:23:02,773 --> 00:23:04,166
Speaker 0: But this is the right strategy.

413
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:04,530
Speaker 0: Ready?

414
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,710
Speaker 0: You would sell the 3DS for the $250.

415
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,049
Speaker 0: Keep the price high.

416
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:13,370
Speaker 0: Put some flash memory in it, right?

417
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,008
Speaker 0: Because if you can afford to drop $70 off the price, you can afford to put 32 gigs of flash in the 3DS.

418
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, 32 gigs of flash is effectively free.

419
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:36,348
Speaker 0: Right, so you put 32 gigs of flash in the 3DS built in, and on that 32 gigs of flash extra, you put every virtual console game, every game that you have the legal right to put on there, you put on there for free.

420
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,089
Speaker 1: Not that that's a good idea.

421
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:39,010
Speaker 0: SNES.

422
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,190
Speaker 1: You gotta be a little more evil here if you want to really make money.

423
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:43,978
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

424
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:44,849
Speaker 0: I'm not done yet.

425
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:47,640
Speaker 0: So, people paying $250, which is $70 profit, right?

426
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,021
Speaker 0: Big time.

427
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,266
Speaker 0: Everyone's like, "Oh shit, people are lining up to buy that

428
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:53,770
Speaker 0: motherfucker.".

429
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,010
Speaker 1: I would have bought one like immediately if that were the thing.

430
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:11,570
Speaker 0: And then, right, what you do is you still charge in the DSiWare, the downloadable area, you know, the DSware, you know, sort of the WiiWare equivalent indie games, and you gotta allow the indie games in, obviously.

431
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,870
Speaker 0: We've talked about that in the past.

432
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,189
Speaker 1: They have Nintendo already then.

433
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, regular DS games, GBA games, GameCube games can run on that, right?

434
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:29,090
Speaker 0: You know, you put all those games in there, not free, but the NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color games, all just all free, period, all of them.

435
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,126
Speaker 0: You get everything, right, in those 32 gigs.

436
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:32,690
Speaker 0: It's already installed.

437
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:34,450
Speaker 0: As soon as you buy the thing, you need to do everything.

438
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,970
Speaker 1: I would have been a little more subtle to make a little more money.

439
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,230
Speaker 1: What I would have done is made NES games free.

440
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,110
Speaker 1: The entire catalog for everyone forever free.

441
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,770
Speaker 0: Or, you know, if you want to make a little bit of money, here's what you can do, right?

442
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,283
Speaker 0: You can say, "Yeah, okay, 10 bucks gets you every NES game, 10 bucks gets you every

443
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:50,385
Speaker 0: SNES.".

444
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,910
Speaker 0: You know, huge bundles for low prices on the oldest games in big, you know, like that.

445
00:24:56,651 --> 00:25:02,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, or, you know, do NES games free just because you gotta have something free so people just buy this thing outright.

446
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:08,110
Speaker 0: You can put the greatest NES hits on there for free, all the ones people really want to play, and then all the rest in a bundle for 10 bucks.

447
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:19,550
Speaker 1: Or what I would do is make a subscription model where, you know, NES games free, whatever, but everything else-- Oh, Spotify, $5 a month, and as soon as you stop paying, all the games go away?

448
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:24,170
Speaker 1: Yep, 5 or 10 bucks a month, you know, a relatively small amount, but not just on that device.

449
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,985
Speaker 0: If you pay for that, you log into a computer, it works on your computer.

450
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,810
Speaker 1: Every device that they make or that is open.

451
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:34,330
Speaker 0: Wii, PC, DS, everything.

452
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,470
Speaker 1: Hell, with them, I would try to make a deal with Microsoft and get it all in the XBLA, but you gotta pay 10 bucks a month for it.

453
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,250
Speaker 0: I would make a controller that can work with Netflix and try to get the games into Netflix.

454
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:46,450
Speaker 1: Oh, that would be eminently doable.

455
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,110
Speaker 1: The Roku could probably do it.

456
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:48,750
Speaker 0: No shit.

457
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,329
Speaker 1: The thing is, Nintendo is married-- So they're old games.

458
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,430
Speaker 1: But Scott, Nintendo is married to the hardware market.

459
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,670
Speaker 0: They're going to be-- They're also married to the idea that games should cost a lot of money.

460
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,810
Speaker 1: I believe Nintendo is going to be the last proprietary console in the world.

461
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:02,670
Speaker 0: Maybe.

462
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,910
Speaker 1: I think Sony consoles, PS3, I think they're going to slowly disappear or edge toward commodity.

463
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,308
Speaker 1: I think Microsoft eventually just-- If you buy an Xbox, it's just a PC.

464
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:21,129
Speaker 1: Or you buy a PC that is "Xbox certified," meaning it has the, you know, whatever level of performance, and Xbox game will just work on either one.

465
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:21,690
Speaker 0: Maybe.

466
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:26,228
Speaker 1: And I think Nintendo is going to hold on to their proprietary bullshit until the bitter end.

467
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:33,249
Speaker 1: But if Nintendo were smart, they would do what Sega did and turn it into an IP company primarily, and the only hardware I would sell would be portable hardware.

468
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,530
Speaker 1: And officially licensed controllers in the shape of NES, SNES, N64, GameCube controllers.

469
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,450
Speaker 0: That's another thing.

470
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:53,910
Speaker 1: If Nintendo just made, like, PC-compatible USB controllers and stuff like that-- Nintendo has probably-- They're one of the few companies that has such a wealth of intellectual property that it is unnerving and ludicrous.

471
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:56,110
Speaker 0: And yet they don't capitalize on it.

472
00:26:57,474 --> 00:27:00,629
Speaker 0: They should take a lesson from the ponies, and they should let Mario go free.

473
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,940
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day, now that we're past the lounge.

474
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:11,565
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

475
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:12,334
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

476
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:27,220
Speaker 1: So remember a long time ago I made a thing of the day, Garfield minus Garfield, which was basically someone was taking every Garfield comic, erasing Garfield, just leaving John, and that was the comic.

477
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:35,840
Speaker 1: And it turns out that Garfield without Garfield is not only funnier than Garfield, but it's one of the better comics I've ever read.

478
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:36,900
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say that.

479
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,140
Speaker 1: There's something great about it.

480
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,703
Speaker 1: It's basically the story-- It gets in.

481
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,740
Speaker 0: It's the same thing over and over again.

482
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:43,260
Speaker 1: It's a little-- It's not really the same thing over and over.

483
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:45,060
Speaker 1: I was reading through it again, and it cracks me up.

484
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,100
Speaker 1: It's just basically one man's descent into lonely madness.

485
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:48,829
Speaker 0: Yeah.

486
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:56,399
Speaker 1: But-- So this is obviously a borderline fair use, something we were just talking about.

487
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,700
Speaker 1: Well, it was announced at Comic-Con, and this is all legit.

488
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:06,991
Speaker 1: Jim Davis thinks that Garfield minus Garfield is hilarious, and Ballantine Books and Paws,

489
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:07,837
Speaker 1: Inc.,

490
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:17,680
Speaker 1: Random House, everyone got together, and Garfield minus Garfield is being released as a legit book with all the blessings of the people who own the Garfield copyright and Jim Davis.

491
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,260
Speaker 0: Does any of that money go to the guy who came up with Garfield minus Garfield, or does all of it go to Jim Davis?

492
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,276
Speaker 1: It looks like it's going to the people who made Garfield minus Garfield and everybody.

493
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,800
Speaker 1: They're all getting money.

494
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:32,420
Speaker 1: It's a legit, straight-up just deal that they made.

495
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,040
Speaker 0: So here's the thing.

496
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,493
Speaker 0: This might sound a little extreme, right?

497
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,939
Speaker 0: But actually, I would say I would have no problem with all the money going to the guy who came up with the Garfield minus Garfield, because think of it this way.

498
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,085
Speaker 1: No.

499
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:48,119
Speaker 0: If you're Andy Warhol and you do Campbell's Soup cans, how much money should go to Campbell's Soup?

500
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,980
Speaker 0: Zero dollars, right?

501
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:56,520
Speaker 0: You wouldn't have a problem with that, so why would you have a problem-- You know, who here thinks money should go to Campbell's Soup because of Andy Warhol selling a painting?

502
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,738
Speaker 1: Put your hand down, Chef Boyardee.

503
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:01,420
Speaker 0: Right?

504
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:07,440
Speaker 0: So, you know, along those lines, that is pretty much what is going on here.

505
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,776
Speaker 0: Well, the other argument you can make is that what the guy-- I'm sure someone out there is saying, "Yeah, the Campbell's Soup should get

506
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:12,979
Speaker 0: money.".

507
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,960
Speaker 1: Is that what the guy did, right, is removing Garfield from Garfield?

508
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:21,100
Speaker 1: Because he didn't have the rights to it, and because it was-- You'd have to argue whether or not it was parody.

509
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:24,239
Speaker 1: So what if someone makes parody of your work?

510
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:27,279
Speaker 1: that consists of nothing but your work with something removed?

511
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:33,800
Speaker 1: If you take your own work and remove the same thing, is that your copyright or that person's copyright?

512
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
Speaker 0: It's-- What part of it is copyrighted?

513
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,679
Speaker 0: The original copyright.

514
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:46,200
Speaker 0: You know, the original artwork is-- You know, it's-- Any piece of art has parts, and you can't just get a copyright for the whole thing.

515
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,500
Speaker 0: It's, you know, artwork-- You know, look at movie credits, right?

516
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,259
Speaker 1: That's because different people make those things.

517
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,359
Speaker 1: If I publish a comic that I wrote and drew, it's my copyright for the entire work.

518
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,980
Speaker 1: Not separated between the different bits.

519
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,640
Speaker 0: That is true.

520
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,559
Speaker 0: But now if I remove, say, Spider-Man from Spider-Man, I take a Spider-Man comic, and I erase all the Spider-Mans, right?

521
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:10,800
Speaker 0: You get credit for all of it except for the removal of the Spider-Mans, which is mine.

522
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, so how do we sort out the money situation there?

523
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:21,400
Speaker 0: I'm not really gonna be making money on it because I don't think you should be able to do anything commercial with a fair use.

524
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,240
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's not so fair.

525
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:23,160
Speaker 1: Here's my argument.

526
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,880
Speaker 1: I think you should, but it should be just like music.

527
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:27,040
Speaker 1: Statutory royalties.

528
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,740
Speaker 0: Statutory royalties, fine.

529
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:39,940
Speaker 1: Because I think the benefit of anyone being able to use anyone's intellectual property, but if they do it commercially, they're forced to pay, I think that would cause more works to be made than any other alternative.

530
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause imagine if YouTube, instead of you got a takedown notice, you had PayPal $1 to have this video go back up.

531
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,347
Speaker 0: Yeah.

532
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:51,220
Speaker 1: Actually, that would probably make a lot of people who make music a lot of money.

533
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,120
Speaker 1: Probably more money than they make from album sales.

534
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:55,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:56,300
Speaker 1: Food for thought, but anyway.

536
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,999
Speaker 0: Or like instead of a dollar, it could be like a tenth of a cent per view.

537
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:04,399
Speaker 1: Oh, that could get bad really quick though, but then again, that's only for commercial use.

538
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:05,040
Speaker 0: Exactly.

539
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:14,359
Speaker 0: If you have ads on the video or something like that, if the video is not making you any money, then it's just in your channel for free with no ads on it, then you don't have to pay anything.

540
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,800
Speaker 1: So anyway, Garfield Minus Garfield, the book is coming out on the 30th anniversary of Garfield.

541
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:19,437
Speaker 0: Do you want it?

542
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,660
Speaker 1: Kinda, actually.

543
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,599
Speaker 0: Then pre-order it on Amazon.

544
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,618
Speaker 1: I probably will.

545
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:28,699
Speaker 1: I'm reading through Garfield Minus Garfield again online, and I really dig this.

546
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,160
Speaker 1: There's one where John just is crying alone in his house for three panels.

547
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,600
Speaker 0: Oh wow, if you search for it on Amazon, the first listing is Garfield Minus Garfield paperback.

548
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:42,139
Speaker 0: The second listing is the same thing again.

549
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,600
Speaker 0: The third listing is Perry Bible Fellowship Almanac.

550
00:31:45,523 --> 00:31:46,259
Speaker 0: Similar humor.

551
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,475
Speaker 0: And then Bunny Suicides.

552
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:51,529
Speaker 1: I laugh at Garfield Minus Garfield for a lot of the same reasons.

553
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,920
Speaker 1: I laugh at the Perry Bible Fellowship.

554
00:31:53,584 --> 00:31:56,319
Speaker 0: Oh, it actually says Garfield Minus Garfield by Jim Davis.

555
00:31:57,688 --> 00:31:57,897
Speaker 1: Huh.

556
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,000
Speaker 1: Interesting.

557
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,657
Speaker 0: Oh no, with a forward by Don, whatever, creator of Garfield Minus Garfield.net.

558
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:07,540
Speaker 0: They didn't give him a credit.

559
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,960
Speaker 1: I didn't read the full details.

560
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,020
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the book on Amazon, that's why I found this.

561
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:14,879
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just think this is cool.

562
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:17,840
Speaker 0: So Alan Moore, he's off and grumpy.

563
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:19,255
Speaker 0: And crazy.

564
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:22,153
Speaker 1: Skies blue.

565
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,548
Speaker 0: But he has an interview with him.

566
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,040
Speaker 0: that's actually pretty damn good.

567
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:36,359
Speaker 0: They ask him about a lot of stuff, and he just gives answers, and he's not that disagreeable, I think because they don't ask him, they don't dive in on things, you know.

568
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,999
Speaker 0: But you learn a lot about Levi's Ordinary Gentleman, what he's up to, and what he's thinking.

569
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,507
Speaker 0: Huh.

570
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:48,420
Speaker 0: And it's probably one of the best Alan Moore interviews I've read, because it's the least crazy, and it's just a normal, good, high quality interview.

571
00:32:49,288 --> 00:32:50,600
Speaker 1: Do they focus on anything in particular?

572
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,199
Speaker 0: He talks about why his magazine is on hold and stuff like that.

573
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:54,613
Speaker 0: Alright.

574
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,939
Speaker 0: And the last question they ask him, because he's a UK guy, obviously, right?

575
00:32:59,203 --> 00:32:59,418
Speaker 0: Okay.

576
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,135
Speaker 0: The last question they ask him is about how they're cutting money for libraries, and he's like, "Oh, it's indefensible, blah, blah,

577
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:06,579
Speaker 0: blah.".

578
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:14,312
Speaker 0: And the very last thing he says in the whole interview, which is what's really awesome, Is, "I gotta go

579
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:14,596
Speaker 0: now.".

580
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:22,560
Speaker 0: No, he's like, "I'm all in favor of anti-cuts demonstrations, and it's always very pleasing to see so many V for Vendetta masks in the crowd.

581
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:24,397
Speaker 0: I'm very proud of those boys and

582
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:24,579
Speaker 0: girls.".

583
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,280
Speaker 0: It's like, well, I'm sure he likes that they're protesting against government cutting libraries.

584
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:44,880
Speaker 1: I would say more that he probably likes the fact that people were, at least to some degree, affected by either his comic or the movie he hated based on his comic.

585
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:45,087
Speaker 1: Yeah.

586
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:49,779
Speaker 0: You know, he would say about that movie that it doesn't exist, much like you say.

587
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:50,336
Speaker 0: Yeah.

588
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,979
Speaker 0: Many things don't exist.

589
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,460
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the sad truth is that M. Night Shyamalan died before he made the Avatar Airbender movie.

590
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,600
Speaker 0: But isn't he making something else, or is that like how Tupac makes more music?

591
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:08,080
Speaker 1: It's funny, because Tupac has come up in three unrelated conversations in the last week with me.

592
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:08,539
Speaker 0: Really?

593
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:08,927
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,760
Speaker 1: Like, a co-worker.

595
00:34:11,021 --> 00:34:12,500
Speaker 0: Fine, it's how Elvis makes more music.

596
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,583
Speaker 0: Okay.

597
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,293
Speaker 1: Elvis did come up last week.

598
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:17,199
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

599
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,219
Speaker 0: They're famous.

600
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,996
Speaker 0: They're gonna come up.

601
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,320
Speaker 1: Tupac, to be honest, I didn't know who Tupac Shakur was until he died.

602
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:25,958
Speaker 0: Really?

603
00:34:26,282 --> 00:34:26,860
Speaker 1: I just didn't know.

604
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,639
Speaker 0: I knew who he was because on the school bus, they played radio stations that played his music.

605
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,757
Speaker 0: So I knew who he was.

606
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,600
Speaker 1: Ah, our school bus didn't play the radio.

607
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,760
Speaker 0: Whoa, that must have been boring as all fuck.

608
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,177
Speaker 1: You know what?

609
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:38,599
Speaker 1: I had a Walkman.

610
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't bring a Walkman to school.

611
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:41,139
Speaker 0: And a Game Boy.

612
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,860
Speaker 0: I didn't bring that to school either.

613
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,958
Speaker 1: I brought them both to school.

614
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:44,388
Speaker 1: Oh.

615
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,339
Speaker 1: Also, my mom's cell phone.

616
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,119
Speaker 0: You mean a Game Gear.

617
00:34:48,123 --> 00:34:49,300
Speaker 1: I wouldn't bring the Game Gear to school.

618
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,148
Speaker 1: It was like 200 bucks.

619
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,239
Speaker 1: That was more money than I could conceive.

620
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,280
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, we are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle in about a month.

621
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,378
Speaker 1: Oh shit, and then you know what?

622
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,780
Speaker 1: Seven months from now, Penny Arcade Expo in Boston.

623
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:08,797
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

624
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:13,840
Speaker 1: The biggest thing we can announce is that we're doing our panel, a new panel, Discover the Forgotten Masters.

625
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:23,159
Speaker 1: But independently, we're doing something different involving teaching large groups of people to play board games, German style board games like Modern Art and Agricola.

626
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,940
Speaker 1: So if this goes well, and you'll want to check this out, there's basically a tabletop workshop room being run by the people who run the tabletop department.

627
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:34,232
Speaker 0: Was this 100% confirmed?

628
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,140
Speaker 1: The workshop room is confirmed.

629
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:37,580
Speaker 1: Okay.

630
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,419
Speaker 1: There's all this stuff that's going to be going on in there.

631
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,240
Speaker 1: It's kind of an experiment.

632
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:50,160
Speaker 1: And if it goes well at PAX Prime, the hope, and this is just me speculating now, don't take this to be anything official from Penny Arcade because we are just speakers.

633
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,160
Speaker 1: We're not in any way affiliated with them otherwise.

634
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,999
Speaker 1: We'll be bigger, more intense at PAX East because there's more space there.

635
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:02,820
Speaker 1: And most of the indie RPG people live over here on our coast, the best coast.

636
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:05,379
Speaker 1: And it's easier to get them to go and do stuff.

637
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:08,539
Speaker 0: East coast is best coast, rhyming with best doesn't make you best.

638
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,439
Speaker 1: Well no, because it's the west coast and the best coast.

639
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:13,159
Speaker 0: That's right.

640
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,198
Speaker 1: I guess there is a coast at the bottom too.

641
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,256
Speaker 0: What?

642
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:19,980
Speaker 1: I mean, Texas has that coastline.

643
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,601
Speaker 0: What?

644
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:22,840
Speaker 0: It's not even in the country.

645
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:38,240
Speaker 1: So yeah, otherwise, book club, own show, join the forum, follow our Twitter, follow the Geek Nights Rim and the Geek Nights YouTube channels, or YouTube accounts, because both of them will have stuff coming in a big way.

646
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:47,379
Speaker 1: I should have probably in the next few days at latest game mechanics and mechanism design as we ran it at PAX East last year.

647
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,720
Speaker 1: I should also relatively soon have How to Win at Games up.

648
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,100
Speaker 1: And we're going to try to start putting pretty much all of our lectures online.

649
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're about to go to PAX and do another one.

650
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're going to film it and try to get it online.

651
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:01,640
Speaker 0: And then Magfest is coming.

652
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:09,600
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get out of the plan we used to do of do like three panels at PAX East and then do the same three at Prime.

653
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,300
Speaker 1: Because, I don't know, I want to do more.

654
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,779
Speaker 1: Like the ideas we have for panels are starting to outstrip the new conventions we have and we've got too many old cons that want the same old stuff every year.

655
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:25,000
Speaker 1: Luckily, Magfest, I think, is going to let us do exactly what we want.

656
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,355
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

657
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,899
Speaker 1: Yep, and Comic Con, all that stuff is coming up.

658
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,219
Speaker 0: I can't really announce anything yet.

659
00:37:30,543 --> 00:37:31,818
Speaker 0: Lots of stuff is coming up.

660
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,419
Speaker 0: It's our e-commerce situation.

661
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,859
Speaker 1: I don't have new t-shirts yet.

662
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:35,309
Speaker 0: Okay.

663
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:37,216
Speaker 0: I don't know.

664
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:37,771
Speaker 0: That's it?

665
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,479
Speaker 0: What about the worst webcomic contest?

666
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,259
Speaker 0: Oh, right!

667
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,560
Speaker 1: The worst webcomic contest.

668
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:42,979
Speaker 1: When should we set the deadline?

669
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,240
Speaker 0: Whenever we do the episode.

670
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,940
Speaker 1: When should we do the episode?

671
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,540
Speaker 0: The next time we need a Wednesday episode and we don't have one.

672
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:50,595
Speaker 1: Alright.

673
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,340
Speaker 1: We'll probably have, I don't know, within a month or so.

674
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,537
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what.

675
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,420
Speaker 1: Submit your non-control alt-delete entries soon.

676
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Speaker 1: Because if two people submit the same comic, whoever submitted it first wins if that comic wins.

677
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,760
Speaker 1: Also, you can stop submitting control alt-delete.

678
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,459
Speaker 1: We got it.

679
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,280
Speaker 0: We said that already.

680
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:11,438
Speaker 1: I got to make sure.

681
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,460
Speaker 1: The level of hate you guys have for CAD is kind of amazing.

682
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,400
Speaker 0: I never even really read it, so I'm going to have to figure out what this hate is all about as part of the episode.

683
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,000
Speaker 1: Well, as far as I can tell, it's about Doomguy and he cries in a hospital.

684
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,017
Speaker 0: Doomguy?

685
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:28,898
Speaker 0: Someone posted- Doomguy doesn't cry.

686
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,900
Speaker 0: He doesn't even have eyes.

687
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:36,880
Speaker 1: There were mashups of the comic where control alt-delete famously had a very special control alt-delete.

688
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:37,859
Speaker 0: Okay.

689
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,300
Speaker 1: Where he kind of went into dark, serious, real world stuff out of nowhere.

690
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:43,000
Speaker 0: Alright.

691
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,158
Speaker 1: Personal stuff.

692
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,660
Speaker 1: And people mash up that comic with Doomguy or My Little Pony.

693
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,347
Speaker 0: Oh, whoa.

694
00:38:50,061 --> 00:39:00,860
Speaker 0: So a guy makes like, it's one thing to mash up a penny arcade, but it's like if they made a very serious penny arcade that was like, you know, someone died and they made like a, you know, something.

695
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,236
Speaker 0: The last time they did that- The thing is when penny arcade does that, like Gary Gygax dies, they make a joke about it.

696
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,040
Speaker 0: Rolling in his grave.

697
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time- Like they already made the joke on it, but if they did it actually seriously, like- Well, because look at what they did.

698
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,600
Speaker 1: If you make a joke like that, that's the kind of joke where Gary Gygax, where he's still alive, would laugh.

699
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:17,839
Speaker 0: He would love that shit.

700
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,800
Speaker 0: I bet he is rolling in his grave because he said he's rolling in his grave.

701
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, because seriously, as much as we rag on- As much as we rag on D&D, Gary Gygax is kind of a god.

702
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:27,295
Speaker 0: Kind of.

703
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:33,050
Speaker 1: So, like we said, shows about horror.

704
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:36,558
Speaker 1: So Frank Miller is famous for a lot of- Okay.

705
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:42,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was saying horror, and then I realized it kind of sounds like whore.

706
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:43,100
Speaker 0: Sure.

707
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,664
Speaker 1: And I was going to make a joke about that, but no.

708
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:50,440
Speaker 1: We're actually kind of, like we both are into horror as a genre.

709
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,518
Speaker 0: Kind of.

710
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,001
Speaker 1: Kind of.

711
00:39:52,543 --> 00:39:58,420
Speaker 1: I've gotten out of it as I've gotten older because I've become jaded by it, and things that used to scare me don't scare me anymore.

712
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,202
Speaker 0: Well, it's weird.

713
00:39:59,322 --> 00:40:00,566
Speaker 0: It's like this total reversal.

714
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:07,920
Speaker 0: When I was really little, I wouldn't watch anything that was supposed to be scary or might have been scary- Oh, you're like the Bill Cosby, like the chicken heart that hit New York City?

715
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:20,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, like even stuff that maybe wasn't actually scary, but appeared to have scariness in it based on the cover or the title or who knows what, I would avoid.

716
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:31,700
Speaker 1: Well, did you ever have this situation where you'd be in Blockbuster, Mammoth Video, and you walk into the horror section, and all the covers are like skeleton with daggers coming out of its eyeballs?

717
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,359
Speaker 0: I don't remember that really.

718
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:33,741
Speaker 1: Really?

719
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:42,500
Speaker 1: Because in the '80s, every horror movie had a particular graphic design on the cover that was particularly horrifying to a six-year-old.

720
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,308
Speaker 0: For me, it was more like I was really little, and he'd be like,

721
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:45,810
Speaker 0: "Alien.".

722
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,552
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "Oh, shit.

723
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:47,575
Speaker 0: I ain't watching that

724
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:48,578
Speaker 0: motherfucker.".

725
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:54,758
Speaker 0: But then eventually, it was just like, "Yeah, I can watch anything, and it's not

726
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:55,260
Speaker 0: scary.".

727
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,561
Speaker 1: Yep.

728
00:40:56,102 --> 00:41:01,320
Speaker 1: See, I had a slightly different experience from most people because my mom- Actually, both my parents were really into horror.

729
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,134
Speaker 0: My mom is really into horrors.

730
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:13,040
Speaker 1: But as a result, I was reading Lovecraft probably early to mid-elementary school.

731
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,830
Speaker 0: I don't think my mom really knows who Lovecraft is, but she's into the more generic horror.

732
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,119
Speaker 0: She loves vampires, but she's like, "Fuck that Twilight

733
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:20,400
Speaker 0: shit.".

734
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:21,879
Speaker 0: She's like- Nosferatu style.

735
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's like some black and white real Dracula who shreds you up.

736
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:26,750
Speaker 1: Bleh.

737
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:37,741
Speaker 1: Of my early literature when I was reading books, the two real-deal long books that I read- Monster Blood, Monster Blood 2.

738
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:44,060
Speaker 1: Were The Hobbit and Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, which was a collection of short horror stories.

739
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,310
Speaker 0: Oh, you remember those fucking books?

740
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,777
Speaker 0: Scary Stories 1, 2, 3 in a Box?

741
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,243
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

742
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,231
Speaker 1: The stories weren't that scary.

743
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:53,520
Speaker 1: The art scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

744
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:02,520
Speaker 1: There's something about that- But was it that you were scared of those books and then you overcame it?

745
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,244
Speaker 0: I think it was pretty much.

746
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:09,900
Speaker 0: My memory is that those books were there because they were popular and I didn't want to go near them because I thought they were scary.

747
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,960
Speaker 0: But then I eventually bought them and read them and then they weren't scary.

748
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,986
Speaker 1: Well, they were kind of funny.

749
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:16,719
Speaker 1: now that I read them again because I have all three.

750
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,385
Speaker 0: They're really stupid.

751
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:18,294
Speaker 0: I have the little box set.

752
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:18,800
Speaker 0: They're stupid.

753
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,820
Speaker 1: Some of them were creepy for how they were portrayed.

754
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,240
Speaker 0: I'd have to go back, but I imagine it's a He-Man situation.

755
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,980
Speaker 1: There's one weird one, Mattai Dotey Walker.

756
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,599
Speaker 0: How do you remember these things?

757
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:31,260
Speaker 1: How do you not remember anything?

758
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,020
Speaker 0: Why would I remember some books I read when I was in fifth grade?

759
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,180
Speaker 1: Scott, name more than three characters from, I don't know, Foundation, the book you just read.

760
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:43,438
Speaker 0: Harry Selden.

761
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,455
Speaker 1: All right, Harry Selden.

762
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:47,780
Speaker 0: The guy who's a traitor.

763
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, traitor or traitor.

764
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,076
Speaker 0: Traitor.

765
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:52,339
Speaker 1: What's his name?

766
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:52,977
Speaker 0: I don't know.

767
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,416
Speaker 0: No?

768
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,240
Speaker 0: If you told me it, I would say that's the one.

769
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,179
Speaker 1: Who was the newspaper guy?

770
00:42:58,122 --> 00:42:59,059
Speaker 0: The newspaper guy.

771
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, what was his name?

772
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:01,059
Speaker 0: Newspaper guy.

773
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,879
Speaker 1: Name any girl.

774
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,320
Speaker 0: There really weren't any girls.

775
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:06,710
Speaker 1: That was my joke.

776
00:43:07,013 --> 00:43:07,839
Speaker 1: I was building up to that.

777
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,200
Speaker 1: I was like, who was the girl in Foundation?

778
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,778
Speaker 0: There weren't.

779
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,639
Speaker 1: Who was the girl in Asimov?

780
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:21,040
Speaker 1: But yeah, I was reading and watching horror from an extremely young age.

781
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:23,330
Speaker 1: I keep saying H.P.

782
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:23,653
Speaker 1: Lovecraft.

783
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:24,540
Speaker 1: In this case, Albert Tishcock.

784
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,939
Speaker 0: I didn't know Lovecraft was until I got to college.

785
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but me and Greg were the ones who were really into Lovecraft before we got to RIT.

786
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,979
Speaker 0: Alex knew about Lovecraft.

787
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course Alex.

788
00:43:32,382 --> 00:43:32,640
Speaker 0: Anyway.

789
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:40,040
Speaker 1: But I was just really into horror my whole life and I remember Night of the Living Dead and all the Jason movies and the Freddy movies.

790
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually didn't watch those when I was very young.

791
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:45,359
Speaker 1: Really?

792
00:43:45,683 --> 00:43:45,770
Speaker 0: Yeah.

793
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,309
Speaker 1: You ever seen all of them?

794
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,700
Speaker 1: Have you seen Halloween?

795
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,476
Speaker 0: Which ones?

796
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:50,060
Speaker 0: Halloween?

797
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,033
Speaker 1: Really?

798
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:52,900
Speaker 1: I don't know.

799
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,619
Speaker 1: Don't remember Halloween?

800
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,310
Speaker 0: Maybe.

801
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,610
Speaker 1: That's the one that has the...

802
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,440
Speaker 0: If I saw it, I saw it on TV in high school on HBO or something.

803
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,479
Speaker 0: Or something like that.

804
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:07,320
Speaker 1: Do you remember a movie that you actually did see that scared you as a kid?

805
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, Boogity.

806
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:08,786
Speaker 1: Mr.

807
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:09,115
Speaker 1: Boogity?

808
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:09,836
Speaker 0: Boogity.

809
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:10,978
Speaker 0: Boogity.

810
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,989
Speaker 0: No, all I remember from it... Boogity Boo.

811
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,480
Speaker 0: These are the scenes I remember from it in my brain.

812
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,439
Speaker 0: I don't know if these were real scenes from it or not.

813
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:19,379
Speaker 1: They're just my memory, right?

814
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,040
Speaker 1: Alright, this ought to be good.

815
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,120
Speaker 0: They're like in a kitchen and there's a scary cape and a hat on the coat rack.

816
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:24,736
Speaker 1: Yup.

817
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,599
Speaker 0: Okay, that's a real memory?

818
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:26,983
Speaker 1: Yup.

819
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,580
Speaker 0: Guy floating down the hallway covered in a blanket but he's floating.

820
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,105
Speaker 0: Yup.

821
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,411
Speaker 0: And he's saying, "Boogity,

822
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:33,815
Speaker 0: Boogity.".

823
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,420
Speaker 0: Just kidding.

824
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,899
Speaker 0: Because if you say it three times, he shows up like Beetlejuice.

825
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:39,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, or it's him possessing you.

826
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,180
Speaker 1: I kind of forget.

827
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,540
Speaker 1: I remember when the ghosts show up and the housewife in the family doesn't know what to do.

828
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,979
Speaker 1: So she invites him in for coffee and she's not sure if they can drink coffee.

829
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,880
Speaker 0: And I remember some scene at a carnival at night outside.

830
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,840
Speaker 1: That, I think, was also the sequel.

831
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:55,699
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

832
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:56,266
Speaker 1: Yeah.

833
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,470
Speaker 1: I remember the end where they suck Mr.

834
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,060
Speaker 1: Boogity up with the shop vac.

835
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:01,480
Speaker 0: I do not remember this.

836
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:01,755
Speaker 0: Really?

837
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,261
Speaker 1: There's something... Mr.

838
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:06,380
Speaker 1: Boogity was kind of scary to a little kid, but as an adult...

839
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,600
Speaker 0: It's so weird because there were movies that were comedies that had horror elements.

840
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,240
Speaker 0: Like say Ghostbusters.

841
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,097
Speaker 0: Or Beetlejuice.

842
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:19,240
Speaker 0: Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice are both comedies, but they had visually things that could be horror movies.

843
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,200
Speaker 0: Scary ghost monster underworld stuff.

844
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,280
Speaker 0: And both of them, at least for me.

845
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,580
Speaker 0: But they weren't horror movies at all.

846
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,740
Speaker 0: They weren't meant to scare.

847
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,400
Speaker 0: They might have had some things to surprise.

848
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,138
Speaker 0: And they had ghosts, but they were comedies straight up.

849
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,599
Speaker 1: But when I was a kid... As a kid, this is the weird thing.

850
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:33,680
Speaker 0: It doesn't come across as a comedy at all.

851
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,500
Speaker 0: I didn't laugh at Ghostbusters when I was a kid.

852
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,275
Speaker 1: Ghostbusters...

853
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,619
Speaker 0: Dickless, I didn't get that joke.

854
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,900
Speaker 1: Well, I got it, but there were funny moments.

855
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,540
Speaker 1: I remember laughing.

856
00:45:41,582 --> 00:45:41,939
Speaker 0: That's true.

857
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:43,440
Speaker 0: This man has no dick.

858
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,399
Speaker 1: But both Ghostbusters and Beetlejuice, I took them as straight up dramas.

859
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,840
Speaker 0: And Ghostbusters 2 was a little scary when I was a kid.

860
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:50,820
Speaker 0: Vigo, I was scared.

861
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, Vigo was pretty creepy.

862
00:45:52,902 --> 00:45:54,080
Speaker 0: Ghostbusters 1, I wasn't scared.

863
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:55,678
Speaker 1: But Vigo, I was scared.

864
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,000
Speaker 1: I took Beetlejuice at such face value.

865
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Speaker 1: I thought it was just like a supernatural thriller.

866
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:02,453
Speaker 0: I didn't get that.

867
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:03,100
Speaker 1: it was a joke.

868
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,559
Speaker 0: I didn't get that it was a joke either.

869
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,689
Speaker 1: Kind of like how I didn't get that.

870
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:06,700
Speaker 1: Project Echo was a joke.

871
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,020
Speaker 1: I was like, "Oh, she has superpowers.

872
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:08,495
Speaker 1: Awesome.".

873
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:09,960
Speaker 0: That's when it happens and you're a little kid.

874
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:10,940
Speaker 0: You get it wrong.

875
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:11,717
Speaker 1: Kids just don't get it.

876
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,780
Speaker 1: Don't try to beat games.

877
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,340
Speaker 1: Just kind of don't color inside the lines.

878
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when you're trying to show your kid something, don't show it to him before he'll get it.

879
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,540
Speaker 1: No, show it to him before they get it because it makes for the memories that shape them into the people they are today.

880
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,619
Speaker 0: So they can make a podcast.

881
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,088
Speaker 0: Yeah.

882
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:36,840
Speaker 1: I think what really scared me as a kid, originally when I was really little, like movies that would make me start were the horror movies that would show the psycho killer.

883
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:42,139
Speaker 1: It'd always be like someone's laying on a bed and then a knife just comes up through the mattress and gets him.

884
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,260
Speaker 0: Well, that's surprise.

885
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,760
Speaker 0: Nobody was a little, little kid.

886
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,497
Speaker 1: It would get me.

887
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:47,599
Speaker 0: Of course it would get you.

888
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,217
Speaker 1: Not in the movie.

889
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,080
Speaker 1: I'd see the movie and I'd be fine.

890
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,840
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "Whatever.

891
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:51,422
Speaker 1: Ha.".

892
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,955
Speaker 1: And then I'd go to bed and I'd think, "What if a knife just came up through my

893
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:56,377
Speaker 1: mattress?".

894
00:46:57,764 --> 00:46:59,920
Speaker 0: No, see, surprise like that, right?

895
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:00,880
Speaker 0: The element of surprise.

896
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,489
Speaker 0: Jump out and go,

897
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:01,571
Speaker 0: "Boo.".

898
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:05,320
Speaker 0: That actually still makes me go, "Ooh," because you're surprising someone.

899
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:05,960
Speaker 0: You can walk up.

900
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:10,760
Speaker 1: Like in "Play Dead" where they played that super fucking loud noise like a second after he turned off the lights.

901
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can walk up behind me and grab my shoulder in the dark when I'm not paying attention.

902
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,138
Speaker 0: I'll go, "Ah," because that's what people do.

903
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,880
Speaker 0: But it doesn't scare me or cause me to lose sleep.

904
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:21,260
Speaker 1: It's funny the different reactions.

905
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,048
Speaker 0: It's so annoying that you go to see a lot of horror movies and all they do is jump out and go,

906
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:25,317
Speaker 0: "Boo."

907
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,039
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Really?

908
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,598
Speaker 0: That's all you got is jump out and go, 'Boo?

909
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:27,884
Speaker 0: Wow.

910
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,294
Speaker 0: Great movie making,

911
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:29,679
Speaker 0: guys.'".

912
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:29,941
Speaker 0: What

913
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:40,051
Speaker 1: was that movie, the one that the angry James Rolfe talked about, that it was like "The Cat People" or "The Panther" or something where it built up to where there would be a jump out and go,

914
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:40,274
Speaker 1: "Boo?"

915
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:49,040
Speaker 1: And then there'd be a noise like a "Boo" was going to happen, but there'd be no "Boo," and the tension wouldn't resolve, and the movie would just keep going.

916
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:59,040
Speaker 1: I forget what movie it was, but I actually like old horror movies because they're usually more like the horror of the human situation.

917
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,080
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I like them, right?

918
00:48:01,401 --> 00:48:05,780
Speaker 0: They're more horrific "Twilight Zone" episodes, "Frankenstein's," "Dracula's," those sorts of things.

919
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,739
Speaker 0: I love those old horror movies, right?

920
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,500
Speaker 0: But the thing is, there really isn't a movie that causes any actual fear or horror in me.

921
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:29,100
Speaker 1: Well, it's hard to do that because the only way to elicit actual fear, not other emotions like surprise, disgust, anything like that, but actual fear, you either have to be so immersed in the movie that what's going on is contextual.

922
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:31,600
Speaker 0: Like that you believe you're in danger for real?

923
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you have to be a little kid and see child's play and happen to have a my buddy in the closet.

924
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,459
Speaker 0: And believe you're in danger.

925
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

926
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,140
Speaker 0: It's really basically, that's really what it comes down to.

927
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,200
Speaker 0: To actually feel real fear, you have to believe truly that you are in some danger.

928
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,734
Speaker 0: Like, you watch something with aliens in it, you got to believe that aliens are coming to get you.

929
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:51,980
Speaker 0: That's a serious possibility.

930
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,050
Speaker 1: What I want out of a haunted house, because I was big, I enjoyed haunted houses as a little kid.

931
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:57,078
Speaker 1: I loved them.

932
00:48:57,682 --> 00:48:58,840
Speaker 1: But they never scared me.

933
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,820
Speaker 1: And I went into them because I was obsessed with watching other people flip the fuck out.

934
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,600
Speaker 0: I don't understand people.

935
00:49:04,701 --> 00:49:06,400
Speaker 0: It's like they scream in a haunted house.

936
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:12,318
Speaker 1: I'm like, like half the audience was like shrieking uncontrollably at some of the things that happen.

937
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,140
Speaker 0: But yeah, I got played as mostly, you know, funny.

938
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,237
Speaker 1: It is mostly funny.

939
00:49:16,888 --> 00:49:17,179
Speaker 0: It's good.

940
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:17,738
Speaker 0: So great.

941
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:18,642
Speaker 1: I started.

942
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:23,080
Speaker 1: it's much better than any haunted house that I started when the rice fell on me out of nowhere.

943
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:23,560
Speaker 1: I start.

944
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:24,755
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

945
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,980
Speaker 0: They're throwing rice in everybody.

946
00:49:28,323 --> 00:49:30,200
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, ah, rice.

947
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,839
Speaker 0: Well, good job, guys.

948
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,937
Speaker 0: Nice one.

949
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:44,700
Speaker 1: But I got to say, the other great thing about horror movies is that even if a kid is old enough to not really be that afraid anymore, if you got a younger brother, nothing's better

950
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:45,743
Speaker 0: younger sibling

951
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:57,443
Speaker 1: than taking your my buddy after he has seen and you have seen Child's Play and just put it in his closet while he's asleep, just going back to bed, not saying anything about

952
00:49:57,483 --> 00:50:01,379
Speaker 0: wait for him to fall asleep, put the my buddy in the bed, then leave now when he wakes up.

953
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:01,968
Speaker 0: It's there now.

954
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,259
Speaker 0: You didn't have it there to be able to do that.

955
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,659
Speaker 1: You suspended from the ceiling over.

956
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,679
Speaker 0: That's for an A plus grade.

957
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,125
Speaker 1: Yeah.

958
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,620
Speaker 1: Even better, though, you put it in the closet, right?

959
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,360
Speaker 1: Because then there's no evidence that you did anything.

960
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:21,175
Speaker 1: Even for the parents, they won't remember whose closet it was in or why it moved or whatever.

961
00:50:21,482 --> 00:50:22,640
Speaker 1: You basically get away scot free.

962
00:50:23,202 --> 00:50:24,239
Speaker 1: You put it in his bed.

963
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:25,416
Speaker 1: You're going to get caught.

964
00:50:26,282 --> 00:50:28,340
Speaker 1: So it's better not get caught.

965
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:28,957
Speaker 0: What's going to happen?

966
00:50:29,804 --> 00:50:30,979
Speaker 0: Oh, I put a toy in his bed.

967
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,594
Speaker 0: Bad me.

968
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:32,340
Speaker 0: I don't know.

969
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:38,980
Speaker 1: When I was a little kid, there was this general of wanting to avoid punishment, even if punishment was never actually forthcoming for anything.

970
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:39,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

971
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:41,219
Speaker 1: You know, Bill Cosby style.

972
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:47,277
Speaker 0: If I have kids ever, I'll be very just with them and they won't get in trouble for doing something like that.

973
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,320
Speaker 1: They actually want justice, not just quiet.

974
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,860
Speaker 0: That's right.

975
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,200
Speaker 0: You know, I want justice, but I also want quiet.

976
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:53,593
Speaker 1: Yeah.

977
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,920
Speaker 1: I think when those two, that'll be burning wheels style.

978
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,960
Speaker 1: Your belief will be justice before quiet.

979
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:00,160
Speaker 1: You'll have to choose between justice and quiet.

980
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:00,978
Speaker 0: I'll take both.

981
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:02,818
Speaker 0: I'll have my cake and eat it too.

982
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:12,484
Speaker 0: You realize burning wheel, the equivalent of that is failing because the thing I think adults don't realize is that even though it might take 10 minutes to get justice, justice brings quiet.

983
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:16,919
Speaker 0: because once they realize, you know, because the kids get, they see up the fair thing was done.

984
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,276
Speaker 0: And they'll stop yelling, complaining and say, why, why?

985
00:51:20,356 --> 00:51:21,040
Speaker 0: no, you're there.

986
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,620
Speaker 0: They're yelling and screaming because they're not getting justice.

987
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:27,439
Speaker 0: If you give them the justice, it takes five minutes then.

988
00:51:27,843 --> 00:51:28,319
Speaker 0: Not always.

989
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:29,580
Speaker 1: When I was a little kid, right?

990
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:38,235
Speaker 1: My little brother one day comes into my room like we're supposed to be in bed and he comes into the room and he puts his arm out and he starts punching himself in the arm until he has a bruise.

991
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:38,780
Speaker 0: Yup.

992
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:44,139
Speaker 1: Then he screams, and I got in so much shit.

993
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,979
Speaker 0: But that's because he wasn't looking for justice.

994
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:48,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

995
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:49,640
Speaker 0: She was required.

996
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,700
Speaker 1: Scott, would you ever believe a kid who said, yeah, he punched himself until he got a bruise.

997
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,640
Speaker 0: No, but I would take the time to explain it to them, right?

998
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:02,559
Speaker 0: For that, look, this is the evidence I have and I'm, I'm the judge and the jury cause we don't have a judge and a jury.

999
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:02,928
Speaker 0: Right?

1000
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:17,959
Speaker 0: So I'm like, look, if I, if this is all the evidence I have to go on, right, what ruling can I possibly make, you know, and explain to them why that whatever ruling I have to hand down and sentence, you know, so that they're, they can't really complain beyond that.

1001
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:19,360
Speaker 0: And I'm like, look, it's out of my hands.

1002
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,320
Speaker 0: I want justice, but that's all I can do because that's the only information I have.

1003
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:29,936
Speaker 0: Does anyone want to submit any evidence, you know, and it's like testimony is not evidence because you could be lying and we don't have lie detectors or bullshit.

1004
00:52:29,997 --> 00:52:34,179
Speaker 0: and you know, it's like you take the time to explain this and then what can they possibly do?

1005
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,639
Speaker 0: You know, they'll be like, oh, you had the best justice you could get given our limited resources.

1006
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:40,975
Speaker 0: So shut up.

1007
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:47,320
Speaker 1: So, uh, horror, cause I guess we got onto child rearing, which we're both experts on.

1008
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:52,080
Speaker 1: So what's your favorite horror?

1009
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,939
Speaker 0: My favorite horror.

1010
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,120
Speaker 1: Maybe separate from the best, like your favorites.

1011
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:02,316
Speaker 0: Some I guess, you know, so something that would be called horror that

1012
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:18,040
Speaker 1: I like a genre or a work like one of my, to this day, I really like Stephen King's skeleton crew because it's a bunch of short stories and they're all very mundane situations turned horrific by strangeness going on that is unexplained or ill explained.

1013
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:28,499
Speaker 1: Like one of them was called where the deer are and a girl wakes up to go to school and just no one's around and there's deer everywhere and just no people and that's kind of it.

1014
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:29,800
Speaker 0: All right.

1015
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,111
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1016
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:33,380
Speaker 1: I like that kind of like sort of existential horror.

1017
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,191
Speaker 1: Like I mean, Lovecraft did that very well of you don't really know what they're afraid of.

1018
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:39,599
Speaker 1: You can't explain it.

1019
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,743
Speaker 1: It's never described.

1020
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:52,440
Speaker 1: the best you've got is this kind of aching uneasiness that everything you've ever believed in, every everything that could possibly be to existence is meaningless and nothing matters.

1021
00:53:52,661 --> 00:53:56,420
Speaker 1: And the best case scenario is eternal torment in some distant forgotten reality.

1022
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,398
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1023
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,220
Speaker 1: My favorite horrors is, I mean, each of the killer isn't horror.

1024
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:04,379
Speaker 1: That's just like torture porn.

1025
00:54:05,762 --> 00:54:10,519
Speaker 0: I think what I like the most is probably the sort of horror where it's like you.

1026
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:12,939
Speaker 0: you're not sure if there really is a monster or not.

1027
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:15,059
Speaker 1: You should read the terror.

1028
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:19,459
Speaker 0: It's like there's people and something fucked up is happening.

1029
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,400
Speaker 0: And it could be that the people are crazy.

1030
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:36,680
Speaker 0: It could be that there's a person doing something like a Scooby Doo situation where, you know, Event Horizon, maybe, you know, but then there's also maybe it is really some sort of horrible monster and like it doesn't appear.

1031
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,616
Speaker 0: But maybe sometimes you think it appears, it doesn't really, you know, and the people are freaking out.

1032
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:44,679
Speaker 1: That would be an interesting video game to make.

1033
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:52,810
Speaker 0: Make a story kind of base game or however you make it where like you never see the monster, but you definitely you see evidence of a monster.

1034
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:58,838
Speaker 0: that you could in the movie leads you to interpret it as evidence of a monster or some sort of ghost or whatever it is.

1035
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:06,556
Speaker 0: But you could potentially explain it as a person up to no good or a coincidence or the weather.

1036
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,839
Speaker 1: What if you make a video game?

1037
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,520
Speaker 0: Crazy person who's seeing things.

1038
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,031
Speaker 1: Because remember Eternal Darkness had that sanity meter, but that was just like meta silliness.

1039
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:13,460
Speaker 1: that would happen.

1040
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't work.

1041
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:28,820
Speaker 1: What if you made a game where it's some sort of like detective mystery, let's say, but maybe you kill people or the reality that you were presented with is not always consistent and you will eventually get to the point where you start like killing monsters.

1042
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,200
Speaker 1: But then the game kind of slowly makes you realize that they aren't monsters.

1043
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:34,317
Speaker 1: So you're the murderer.

1044
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:42,296
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot of games like that already where there are some, you know, sometimes what you're looking at is a hallucination and sometimes what you're looking at is for real, right?

1045
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,700
Speaker 0: You know, and that's because the main character is the crazy person, which I explained is one of the possibilities.

1046
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,494
Speaker 1: It was you all along.

1047
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,259
Speaker 0: There's plenty of movies like that, too, where sometimes you'll see the movie from a perspective of a person.

1048
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,380
Speaker 0: And sometimes it'll be something the person seeing that's not real.

1049
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:57,560
Speaker 0: And sometimes it will be something that's real.

1050
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,999
Speaker 0: And sometimes it'll be the person seeing something not real, but part of it was real and part of it wasn't.

1051
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,299
Speaker 0: So like maybe they'll see a monster and attack it.

1052
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:10,359
Speaker 0: And then when they're all done hallucinating, they'll see like evidence that they attack something.

1053
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,358
Speaker 1: Tom Hanks was in a movie about that.

1054
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,078
Speaker 0: What movie?

1055
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:14,780
Speaker 1: Really?

1056
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:15,358
Speaker 1: You don't know.

1057
00:56:16,022 --> 00:56:18,159
Speaker 1: You don't know what I'm referring to right now at all.

1058
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,200
Speaker 1: Uh, OK, well, we'll talk about that after the show.

1059
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,080
Speaker 1: I'll leave that up for the listeners.

1060
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:24,540
Speaker 0: I probably might have seen it.

1061
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:26,380
Speaker 1: I almost guarantee you have.

1062
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,980
Speaker 1: You probably don't because Tom Hanks was so young, maybe anyway.

1063
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,567
Speaker 1: But what or like?

1064
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:39,659
Speaker 1: where's the movie I was just thinking of, because it then horizon kind of has it like what happened to these people?

1065
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,077
Speaker 1: Mystery going on.

1066
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:46,140
Speaker 0: Oh, those are always I like because I love that when you, you know, horror, like on its own, right?

1067
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:48,099
Speaker 0: It's like you can't really scare me.

1068
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:49,238
Speaker 0: Jump out and go.

1069
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,319
Speaker 0: Boo works on me.

1070
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,198
Speaker 0: Like I go, I go.

1071
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,880
Speaker 0: Oh, but then I get surprised.

1072
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:53,620
Speaker 0: But it's lame.

1073
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:54,499
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, big deal.

1074
00:56:54,943 --> 00:56:55,919
Speaker 0: You you you surprise me.

1075
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,798
Speaker 0: Good job, guys.

1076
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:02,040
Speaker 0: And you know, I guess Gore is kind of silly at this point.

1077
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:06,519
Speaker 0: Even the extreme each of the killer kind of stuff is kind of like, you know, low holes.

1078
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,152
Speaker 0: So it's like horror on its own doesn't work.

1079
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:12,759
Speaker 0: yet to combine horror with something else that's also good.

1080
00:57:13,302 --> 00:57:15,400
Speaker 0: And then you can get like added powers.

1081
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:15,530
Speaker 0: Right.

1082
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:22,700
Speaker 0: So you can combine horror with sci fi to get an alien, which is still awesome, where you combine horror with adventure or combine horror with mystery.

1083
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:25,558
Speaker 0: And then you get something going on.

1084
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:31,802
Speaker 0: And you know, what's even worse are things that are like considered horror that aren't like.

1085
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:33,500
Speaker 0: is a vampire movie really hard?

1086
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,340
Speaker 0: It's like just because a vampire is sort of a monster, does that make it hard?

1087
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,680
Speaker 0: You know, just because Frankenstein is a is a classic universal horror monster.

1088
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:43,040
Speaker 0: Does that mean that any Frankenstein movie is horror?

1089
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:44,960
Speaker 0: It's like they're another kind of silly.

1090
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:45,694
Speaker 0: A lot of them.

1091
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1092
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,864
Speaker 1: So, Scott, for what you described of what you like in horror fiction is the parts that are hard.

1093
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:54,580
Speaker 1: You really need to read the terror.

1094
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:56,359
Speaker 1: That book I was reading before, Dan Simmons.

1095
00:57:57,585 --> 00:57:58,419
Speaker 1: You know what it's about, right?

1096
00:57:58,581 --> 00:57:58,663
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1097
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,258
Speaker 0: It's about the boat.

1098
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,680
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it's about well, two boats that go up into the Arctic.

1099
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:04,575
Speaker 0: That's the Hyperion guy, right?

1100
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:04,980
Speaker 0: Or not.

1101
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,858
Speaker 0: No, it's the Napoleon guy.

1102
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:07,912
Speaker 0: Or is it?

1103
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:08,440
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

1104
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:16,058
Speaker 1: So the story is basically, you know, it's what happened to these people and there is a monster.

1105
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:22,220
Speaker 1: But maybe not, I don't want to spoil anything.

1106
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,520
Speaker 1: It is exactly everything you just said you like about horror.

1107
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:30,422
Speaker 1: I can lend it to you, though, it kind of smells because it's an old book that I got to use bookstore.

1108
00:58:33,213 --> 00:58:34,800
Speaker 1: But I'll reveal for everyone.

1109
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is a Hyperion guy.

1110
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,640
Speaker 1: Time Hanks was in Mazes and Monsters.

1111
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:40,540
Speaker 0: Never heard of it.

1112
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:40,882
Speaker 1: Really?

1113
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:43,780
Speaker 1: It's about how Dungeons and Dragons makes you go crazy and kill people.

1114
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:44,999
Speaker 0: I never heard of this.

1115
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:51,334
Speaker 1: You could argue that it is kind of one of the causes of the Dungeons and Dragons hysteria.

1116
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,750
Speaker 0: I never heard of this ever.

1117
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:53,640
Speaker 0: I didn't know there was a movie.

1118
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:54,054
Speaker 0: Really?

1119
00:58:54,629 --> 00:58:54,780
Speaker 0: Nope.

1120
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,560
Speaker 1: Maybe we should watch it and do a show on it.

1121
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,799
Speaker 0: That sounds like a good idea.

1122
00:58:59,061 --> 00:59:00,339
Speaker 1: It's a terrible movie.

1123
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:01,777
Speaker 0: I'm sure it is.

1124
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:04,640
Speaker 0: It's from the year 1982.

1125
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,298
Speaker 0: It's as old as us.

1126
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:05,742
Speaker 0: Yes.

1127
00:59:06,345 --> 00:59:08,517
Speaker 1: Tom Hanks was like twenty six when he was in it.

1128
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:12,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, but meanwhile, if you look at this movie, the DVD cover, it looks just like it.

1129
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:14,323
Speaker 0: He looks now.

1130
00:59:16,008 --> 00:59:19,641
Speaker 1: That's a picture of him from now because they rereleased it to try to make money.

1131
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:30,282
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it says right here in the caption, the cover were present in the movie and the picture of Tom Hanks is far more recent than 1982.

1132
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:32,660
Speaker 0: I guess they just wanted to make him recognizable on the DVD cover.

1133
00:59:32,924 --> 00:59:33,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

1134
00:59:34,481 --> 00:59:45,660
Speaker 1: I have a mixed relationship with Japanese horror because a lot of it is just like spooky mystery where it almost edges more toward fantasy or sci fi or torture porn.

1135
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,222
Speaker 0: It is weird.

1136
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,360
Speaker 0: A horror from different countries varies a great deal.

1137
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,199
Speaker 1: And like how I really dig just from watching all the monster madness with James Rolfe.

1138
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,284
Speaker 1: It seems like Spanish and like Portuguese horror and Italian horror is some of the most fun.

1139
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:01,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely the most fun.

1140
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:03,939
Speaker 1: Maybe not the best, but the most fun.

1141
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it sort of has that campiness to it.

1142
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:13,300
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it's so like allegorical and metaphorical and so overwrought.

1143
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

1144
01:00:15,587 --> 01:00:18,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know, but it's like every country has like these different things.

1145
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,220
Speaker 0: I guess different things scare different people.

1146
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:21,823
Speaker 0: Right.

1147
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:22,397
Speaker 1: Which makes sense.

1148
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:26,180
Speaker 0: But it's like they're, you know, I guess jump out and go boo scares anybody.

1149
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:32,700
Speaker 0: But it's like in terms of the non jump out and go boo, something that might be silly to us might be frightening to, you know, another culture.

1150
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:37,260
Speaker 0: But whereas, you know, humor seems to be a little bit more universal.

1151
01:00:37,461 --> 01:00:37,742
Speaker 0: Right.

1152
01:00:37,822 --> 01:00:43,550
Speaker 1: But at the same time, not entirely British humor stands out very distinct from American humor.

1153
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,299
Speaker 1: It does.

1154
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:46,179
Speaker 0: But you still laugh at the British humor.

1155
01:00:46,803 --> 01:00:46,884
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1156
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,460
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know, but is that just because of the accent?

1157
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,380
Speaker 1: But if British horror would still be funny if it was just completely an American accent.

1158
01:00:55,762 --> 01:00:56,349
Speaker 0: Why don't we do it?

1159
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:57,260
Speaker 1: Huh?

1160
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:59,660
Speaker 1: Just redo all the Monty Python stuff.

1161
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,620
Speaker 1: With just normal normal.

1162
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,939
Speaker 0: Let's just dub over Monty Python skits.

1163
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:04,784
Speaker 1: Huh.

1164
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,439
Speaker 1: And see if people still laugh.

1165
01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:08,679
Speaker 1: We need better voices than us.

1166
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,366
Speaker 0: We got to act.

1167
01:01:09,487 --> 01:01:10,054
Speaker 0: Just you act.

1168
01:01:10,721 --> 01:01:11,959
Speaker 0: But you act without a British accent.

1169
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:12,301
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1170
01:01:12,322 --> 01:01:13,518
Speaker 1: We need different voices from us.

1171
01:01:15,162 --> 01:01:16,009
Speaker 1: Of course, we did that.

1172
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,360
Speaker 0: That's a Miku in Friends.

1173
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,360
Speaker 1: We did that Shakespearean Pulp Fiction that one time.

1174
01:01:19,964 --> 01:01:20,208
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1175
01:01:20,432 --> 01:01:20,676
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1176
01:01:21,602 --> 01:01:23,900
Speaker 0: Anyway, do we need to keep going with this?

1177
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,751
Speaker 1: I haven't really seen horror recently.

1178
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:27,120
Speaker 1: that's gotten me going.

1179
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:31,802
Speaker 0: Well, because I think the thing is nowadays, all the horror movies that you see, at least in the U.S.

1180
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:36,221
Speaker 0: that are big and popular are like these, you know, like the Saw, which I've never seen any of those.

1181
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:40,519
Speaker 0: But from what I can tell, it's pretty much just like, dude saws people up.

1182
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:47,150
Speaker 1: No, it's more, you know, all the sort of like hypothetical moral situation, like, all right, you're locked in a room.

1183
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,798
Speaker 1: There's another guy.

1184
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:48,751
Speaker 1: He's tied up.

1185
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:49,279
Speaker 1: There's a gun.

1186
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:52,120
Speaker 1: The door will only unlock if the other guy dies.

1187
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:54,600
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're going to be locked in there until you both starve to death.

1188
01:01:54,982 --> 01:01:55,705
Speaker 0: How does that?

1189
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:58,820
Speaker 0: how do they tie those situations like that into an actual cohesive plot?

1190
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,541
Speaker 0: Or is it just scene and then another scene and another scene and they're not related to each other?

1191
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:04,853
Speaker 0: They're related enough because I mean, you're not.

1192
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,742
Speaker 0: you can't have just that scene for 90 minutes.

1193
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:10,020
Speaker 1: Well, you can have a bunch of those scenes that are tied together by a flimsy plot.

1194
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, the flimsy plot.

1195
01:02:11,444 --> 01:02:19,498
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I was just saying is that I've not seen any of the Saw movies all the way through, but I've seen scenes from Saw's.

1196
01:02:21,201 --> 01:02:23,839
Speaker 0: Would you count like Silence of the Lambs as horror in any way?

1197
01:02:24,222 --> 01:02:25,028
Speaker 1: That you know what?

1198
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:26,720
Speaker 1: I would argue that that is thriller.

1199
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's hard, you know, but it's like I've seen some people also say that terror is a separate genre from horror.

1200
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,899
Speaker 0: Terror is like so many horror subgenres, too.

1201
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:45,040
Speaker 1: I know, but they argue is one of those high level word almost doesn't even mean there's horror, terror, thriller action, which is separate from thriller.

1202
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,719
Speaker 1: Thriller is like halfway between action and horror.

1203
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:55,840
Speaker 1: And terror is more like like a like, I don't know, falling down could almost be because someone is terrorizing.

1204
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,580
Speaker 0: It's true, but it's not terrifying to watch it.

1205
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,222
Speaker 1: No, it isn't.

1206
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:04,080
Speaker 1: I mean, movie, I mean, terrifying Avatar, The Last Airbender.

1207
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:11,580
Speaker 0: I like to categorize, you know, things, you know, not base, you know, because like too many people categorize things based on the aesthetic or other things like that.

1208
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:13,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I got to categorize it.

1209
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,879
Speaker 1: It's horror because it has a werewolf in it.

1210
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how Americans seem to do it.

1211
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:20,240
Speaker 0: But it's like American Railroad from London, more of a Teen Wolf.

1212
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,660
Speaker 0: It's like not hard, dude.

1213
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,649
Speaker 1: What about Teen Boat?

1214
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,540
Speaker 1: I mean, he's a wereboat.

1215
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:25,392
Speaker 1: Does that make it horror?

1216
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:25,494
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1217
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,820
Speaker 0: No, you got to categorize it based on the primary emotion that is instilled in the viewer.

1218
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:37,759
Speaker 1: But then by that logic, that changes, Scott, by that logic, Clifford with Martin Short is clearly a horror film.

1219
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,224
Speaker 0: Sure, whatever.

1220
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:47,760
Speaker 0: But, you know, but, you know, if you use that, the problem is that something might be different genres based on the viewer, not based on the contents.

1221
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:54,859
Speaker 0: You have to judge it based on the intended emotion of the creator, the primary intended emotions of the creator.

1222
01:03:55,602 --> 01:03:55,763
Speaker 0: Right.

1223
01:03:55,783 --> 01:03:58,259
Speaker 0: So it was created with the intent to frighten.

1224
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,880
Speaker 0: Even if now, 50 years later, it is is silly and corny.

1225
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:04,080
Speaker 0: You have to put it in the horror category.

1226
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:04,802
Speaker 0: Right.

1227
01:04:05,263 --> 01:04:11,464
Speaker 1: But, you know, but then if we do that, I mean, the monsters movie is kind of horror.

1228
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:12,980
Speaker 0: It wasn't intended to frighten anyone.

1229
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:14,779
Speaker 1: I would argue that it kind of was.

1230
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:15,626
Speaker 1: No.

1231
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:16,579
Speaker 1: When was the last time you saw it?

1232
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:16,861
Speaker 1: All right.

1233
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:20,200
Speaker 0: Ernest Scared Stupid was entirely a comedy.

1234
01:04:21,703 --> 01:04:22,586
Speaker 1: I would argue it's.

1235
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:26,440
Speaker 1: it fits the horror genre almost more.

1236
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,859
Speaker 1: It's more horror than comedy, partly because Ernest P. Worrell, not funny.

1237
01:04:31,562 --> 01:04:32,266
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

1238
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,460
Speaker 0: But that's an entirely separate thing.

1239
01:04:34,901 --> 01:04:39,200
Speaker 0: Somehow when I was a little kid, it was its intended emotion, not succeed.

1240
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:42,040
Speaker 1: I think horror was intended in addition to comedy.

1241
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:45,299
Speaker 0: You could call it a horror comedy, then go nuts.

1242
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:51,166
Speaker 1: But as a kid, for some reason, Ernest Goes to Camp was like one of my favorite movies when I was really young.

1243
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:53,540
Speaker 0: Never really big Ernest fan.

1244
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,159
Speaker 1: Neither was I, except for Ernest Goes to Camp.

1245
01:04:57,183 --> 01:04:58,439
Speaker 1: Have you seen Ernest Goes to Camp?

1246
01:04:59,343 --> 01:05:00,578
Speaker 0: If I did, I didn't remember it.

1247
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:01,487
Speaker 1: Really?

1248
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:02,319
Speaker 1: It has one pretty good...

1249
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,379
Speaker 0: All I remember is that Ernest was this dopey guy.

1250
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,325
Speaker 0: He was in stuff.

1251
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:07,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all I remember.

1252
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:10,587
Speaker 0: You gonna end on that?

1253
01:05:17,157 --> 01:05:19,280
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
