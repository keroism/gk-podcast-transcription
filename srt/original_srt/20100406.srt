1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,367
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday April 6th.

2
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:12,029
Speaker 2: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,875
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:19,056
Speaker 1: after a long Boston hiatus We are back with the PAX East 2010 show.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,208
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,697
Speaker 1: It's so weird to be back in my real life.

7
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:32,348
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's all right.

8
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:40,940
Speaker 1: after that whole week You know we were in Boston for our packs And we had a week going around with the fun spot and everything and then anime Boston and then a flight home.

9
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:42,852
Speaker 1: And now here we are on Tuesday.

10
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:43,980
Speaker 2: It's actually weird.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:54,800
Speaker 2: it's like I've almost come back to a new life you know because like Everything's different now that I'm back here like all these things changed while I was away I know think of that we went out and the weather was shitty.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,540
Speaker 1: It was just rainy and cold and miserable.

13
00:00:56,962 --> 00:01:00,020
Speaker 1: And we came back and the weather's beautiful and it's sunny and the sun's out.

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,185
Speaker 2: It's like I can ride my bike to work now Which I wasn't doing before.

15
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:12,040
Speaker 2: and then also there's a. there's a little space in our office where this other I'm not gonna explain all the details, but basically all these people moved out of our office somewhere else.

16
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:17,309
Speaker 2: There's a whole bunch of empty desks in this one area And you know this is all you know.

17
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,514
Speaker 2: and then the new guy.

18
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:19,960
Speaker 2: we have a new guy on the tech team.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,750
Speaker 2: So he started working the Monday after PAX East.

20
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:26,226
Speaker 2: so it's like oh, it's like a completely different world I came back to.

21
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,012
Speaker 1: it was actually weird.

22
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:31,674
Speaker 1: You know getting back to work I kind of like on this visceral level forgot what it was that I do.

23
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:33,320
Speaker 1: I mean I get there and I sit down.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,760
Speaker 1: I'm like all right this shit.

25
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:38,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember this.

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,640
Speaker 1: I almost forgot one of the passwords.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,111
Speaker 1: Yeah But how we're back what kind of way.

28
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:48,249
Speaker 2: you're like this super professional place And you've got a situation where there's like a shared password.

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,399
Speaker 1: No no one of the passwords of my own Uh-huh because I have a lot of systems and a couple of them use different passwords for certain reasons.

30
00:01:55,842 --> 00:02:02,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, hmm, but anyway all that aside We're back and the show be a little odd because we're experimenting with video as you all know.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,500
Speaker 1: So we actually during the week between PAX and anime Boston recorded a series of five to ten minute segments about packs.

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,768
Speaker 2: We thought would be podcasting that whole week.

33
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:12,490
Speaker 1: Haha.

34
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, we thought we'd stream stuff out of packs.

35
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:17,028
Speaker 1: that Sprint card And that Verizon card laughed at us.

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,035
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was all right, but we learned We still uploaded a bunch of youtubes and stuff and other things.

37
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:23,697
Speaker 2: with those it was.

38
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:26,834
Speaker 1: it was a good deal Yep, but basically this show is a little weird.

39
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:29,068
Speaker 1: because we have all these segments I'm gonna kind of string them together.

40
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:39,040
Speaker 1: so if you hear any Discontinuities where we kind of start up again or start up again or talk about something twice That's just because we suck and we're complete unprofessional at this point.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,563
Speaker 1: lol.

42
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:48,360
Speaker 1: Because we were trying this new experiment and now we're recording the kind of the rapper to the pack show.

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,946
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was later.

44
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,979
Speaker 2: I think it was good because we talked about packs while we still remembered it.

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, so everything in the kind of the beginning of this and the end of this is only the memories that shown through.

46
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:05,857
Speaker 1: I mean, you know kind of the longer you wait after event only the strongest Impressions are the ones that you actually remember enough to talk about.

47
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:10,994
Speaker 1: So it'll be interesting if we do end up repeating anything, but hopefully not so.

48
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:27,433
Speaker 1: PAX East 2010.

49
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,278
Speaker 0: So here we are lazy asses.

50
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:33,872
Speaker 0: we were supposed to make podcasts and videos all week between packs and anime Boston But we didn't.

51
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:34,795
Speaker 1: yeah, well Monday.

52
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,723
Speaker 1: I was basically dead and Tuesday.

53
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:37,807
Speaker 1: I was almost still.

54
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:42,505
Speaker 0: we were in New Hampshire And Wednesday, we're coming back from New Hampshire and eating dinner.

55
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,508
Speaker 1: and now it's Thursday.

56
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,538
Speaker 0: Thursday We went to MIT and tomorrow's anime Boston.

57
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:55,049
Speaker 0: So we really didn't make the podcast and videos We thought we would make while we were sitting around in hotels doing nothing because we didn't really sitting around hotels doing nothing.

58
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,353
Speaker 0: all That much until now.

59
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:56,875
Speaker 0: Yeah.

60
00:03:57,356 --> 00:04:01,168
Speaker 0: Hey, it's anime Boston's tomorrow and so excited.

61
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,266
Speaker 0: Yeah Can really easily hide it.

62
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,856
Speaker 0: We're gonna do our packs.

63
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,606
Speaker 0: wrap up review ish packs East.

64
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:15,850
Speaker 0: review a show While it is fresh in our minds because come Monday will have a brain full of anime Boston.

65
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,550
Speaker 1: Well, I feel like it's weird doing this.

66
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,704
Speaker 1: I'm so used to doing like the show with like a microphone like up in my face doing the like.

67
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,292
Speaker 1: I don't worry about the I don't.

68
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:23,518
Speaker 1: I feel like we're a little stilted right now.

69
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,824
Speaker 0: We are quite used it up.

70
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:25,627
Speaker 1: So packs.

71
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:38,137
Speaker 1: Holy shit we were at PAX East 2010 the first PAX East and The amazing thing about is that you know We were we did the like preview show and we kept having that disclaimer that if it's not as awesome If we've been making these packs is out to be.

72
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,443
Speaker 1: it's not our fault.

73
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,190
Speaker 1: You know, it's a new packs new location.

74
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,880
Speaker 1: we don't know a hundred percent what it's gonna be like.

75
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,121
Speaker 1: for all.

76
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:48,601
Speaker 1: we know they're gonna cock it up and I'm pleased to report that they did not cock it up.

77
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:52,035
Speaker 1: In fact, I would say it was like it was 95% packs.

78
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,586
Speaker 0: It was definitely 95% PAX West.

79
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:55,610
Speaker 0: I mean what was different?

80
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,246
Speaker 1: The only difference was that the convention center in Seattle lets Joko sing for like an extra two hours.

81
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean They're really everybody fits in main events pretty much.

82
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:04,867
Speaker 2: Yeah.

83
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,638
Speaker 0: So PAX East it was PAX West.

84
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:13,481
Speaker 0: if you're worried about what PAX West was like and you've been to PAX East you pretty much know It's the real deal.

85
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:14,709
Speaker 0: PAX is PAX is PAX.

86
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,114
Speaker 0: I'm pretty confident.

87
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:21,670
Speaker 0: they can pull off packs anywhere in the US that they want probably maybe anywhere in the world probably anywhere in Canada.

88
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:27,750
Speaker 0: You know other countries is still yet to be seen, you know language barrier cultural differences, you know.

89
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,670
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't think packs China would work really or I think the back Scotland would go pretty well.

90
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,197
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Scottish people at this guy.

91
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,790
Speaker 0: I think a packs in the UK anywhere in the english-speaking world.

92
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:42,714
Speaker 1: They could probably rock a packs, you know, they could do like a French packs But they'd have to get like all local enforcers They could probably do a.

93
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:45,485
Speaker 0: German packs would probably do equally the same.

94
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:45,987
Speaker 1: I think so.

95
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,270
Speaker 1: I think so All right, yeah, but I mean it was great.

96
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:58,102
Speaker 1: The only problem with packs that anyone is that a real complaint about this is a legitimate concern Is that the main events hall was tiny like you did.

97
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,246
Speaker 1: it was crazy.

98
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:08,168
Speaker 1: at PAX West, you know The room doesn't fit everybody for like the concerts and everything But people if you wait like 20 minutes after the concert starts you can just get in and like the keynote

99
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,457
Speaker 0: you could just get into the concerts at PAX East -

100
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,955
Speaker 1: well the Friday concert definitely the Saturday concert was actually Almost like.

101
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,029
Speaker 1: it was pretty much almost at capacity the whole time.

102
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people are still walking in and out that you could go to the bathroom.

103
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:19,809
Speaker 0: You can come back.

104
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:24,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it was notice how the omega-thon finale and especially the keynote and the opening.

105
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:30,208
Speaker 1: sir You know the stuff people really wanted to go that Every single person going to the con no matter what wanted to go to the keynote and the Q&A.

106
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,538
Speaker 0: Well, those are those are times when there was.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,963
Speaker 0: there were seats in there.

108
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,610
Speaker 0: Remember closing ceremonies had no seats.

109
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:46,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, right So everyone can fit in and the doors were still well luckily because not everyone who was at the con went to that But the keynote and the open the queue and the first Q&A panel.

110
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,790
Speaker 0: right they were at capacity.

111
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,863
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I don't know this for certain cuz I didn't go to them.

112
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:54,061
Speaker 0: that Q&A to you know Make a strip panel etc.

113
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,250
Speaker 0: Were also capacity.

114
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,633
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz those were.

115
00:06:56,793 --> 00:07:02,197
Speaker 0: those are events in main events where the receipts and not just openness cuz that's the one thing about packs that anime Cons don't have.

116
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:06,330
Speaker 1: the culture is definitely You go to everything in the main events or at least everything you want.

117
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,030
Speaker 1: Like the main events kind of are the anchor of the whole con like they're the biggest things.

118
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,408
Speaker 1: they're so big that like the majority people go to many of them.

119
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:17,910
Speaker 1: and The trouble is just that that main events hall in this convention center is way too small.

120
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:26,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has an upper deck, which is really nice, but it doesn't seem that many people up there I think they said the total capacity upper and lower was fifty five hundred people not enough.

121
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:27,997
Speaker 0: No, they need like seven thousand.

122
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:31,390
Speaker 1: cuz they were what there were I think about sixteen thousand people at PAX East.

123
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:37,410
Speaker 1: Yeah They need a seven or eight thousand capacity main events or they need to move somewhere where they could fit the entire con.

124
00:07:38,012 --> 00:07:43,370
Speaker 1: Like Otakon does that well with the mariner arena they can fit the entire con into the cosplay thing.

125
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,677
Speaker 0: Is it an anime convention?

126
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,029
Speaker 0: The only main event anyone wants to go to is the cosplay?

127
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:48,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like we could fix that.

128
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,469
Speaker 1: I mean we gotta have more keynotes like the New York anime festival.

129
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,092
Speaker 1: They did that.

130
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,846
Speaker 1: they had a keynote and I think more compact.

131
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:54,610
Speaker 0: they packed the room.

132
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:58,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't a big main events room, but it was the biggest room they had and they tried.

133
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,001
Speaker 0: They were originally intending to put that in a smaller room.

134
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:01,383
Speaker 0: Yeah.

135
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:02,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it was.

136
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:02,890
Speaker 0: it was good.

137
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,125
Speaker 1: It proves that you can do it, but you know official news.

138
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,310
Speaker 1: This is I'm sure it's out there.

139
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:15,810
Speaker 1: It was announced at PAX to us by many people But PAX is moving and PAX East is not going to be at the Heinz Convention Center because the heinz is way too tiny.

140
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:23,790
Speaker 0: We're gonna be it's still gonna be in Boston at a convention center We did not know existed called the BC EC and I have done a cursory amount of research.

141
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:29,187
Speaker 0: The BC EC appears to be about as big as the Baltimore Convention Center, which is Otakon.

142
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:30,150
Speaker 1: that but it's 20.

143
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,850
Speaker 0: It might not it might not be exactly as big I think it is smaller, but it is still in that same size category.

144
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:46,307
Speaker 0: You know gigantic rooms with hundreds of thousands of square feet with really tall ceiling But also many whole bunch of small rooms, you know the same sort of deal.

145
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:53,405
Speaker 0: So PAX East will be in Boston in the BC EC Probably next year and probably for the next three years after that.

146
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,430
Speaker 1: We'll see how that works.

147
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,520
Speaker 1: I mean on one hand the convent that's bigger.

148
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,730
Speaker 1: I mean even if it's the size of the BCC in Baltimore.

149
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:03,706
Speaker 1: So 25,000 people packs could grow another 10,000 and then be at capacity again.

150
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:05,010
Speaker 1: It's quite possible.

151
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:07,749
Speaker 1: I think it'll sell out there no matter how many people they can fit.

152
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:17,152
Speaker 1: Oh, I honestly think that the pecs East could have if there were no limit on registrations Forty to fifty thousand bodies not the bullshit turnstile They can see.

153
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:27,271
Speaker 0: what I'm worried about mostly is that you know there because an enforcer is so great You know, they can have a very low ratio of enforcer to attend 80 enforcers to 16,000.

154
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,837
Speaker 0: I don't think it was an 80 enforcers.

155
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:29,479
Speaker 1: That's what they said.

156
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see but there were about 80 enforcers.

157
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:33,380
Speaker 0: We'll have to look that up.

158
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:42,030
Speaker 0: Anyway, the thing is If you have if you spread the geography a gigantic convention center where covering ground is not trivial, right?

159
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,906
Speaker 0: You're gonna need a lot more enforcers and they might have to accept every every person who applies.

160
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,330
Speaker 0: It's gonna be pretty interesting.

161
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think they should tear it.

162
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,805
Speaker 1: If anything like even the lowest lowest like if you're just volunteering and all you're doing is directing people.

163
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,030
Speaker 1: You're still an enforcer.

164
00:09:56,094 --> 00:10:06,740
Speaker 1: Yeah but they might have to tear up as opposed to tear down when you've got enforcers and Not totally committed enforcer but like arch enforcer they give them some cool title I don't know, but they're gonna need.

165
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,787
Speaker 0: they're gonna need a lot of enforcers And if that's what you want to do, you should sign up.

166
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:12,821
Speaker 1: Yes However, I point out a lot of the front row crew were enforcers.

167
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,609
Speaker 1: a lot of people we know were enforcers.

168
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,664
Speaker 1: Every single one of them said that they had an amazing time.

169
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:18,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's totally awesome.

170
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,450
Speaker 0: The only thing is like, you know, occasionally someone would be an enforcer and I'd be like, hey, let's go to dinner tonight.

171
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:23,851
Speaker 0: They'd be like.

172
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:27,906
Speaker 0: I got my shift, you know, but they didn't skip their shift.

173
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,010
Speaker 0: They did not want to do it.

174
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,756
Speaker 0: They went to the shift and enjoyed the shift.

175
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:34,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, they row lost her voice as an enforcer teaching people how to play games.

176
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,670
Speaker 1: That's not even she doesn't have to do that.

177
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,983
Speaker 1: It's not like the enforcer like you have to spend four hours teaching people to play games.

178
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:40,666
Speaker 1: She did that.

179
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:41,530
Speaker 1: cuz it's fucking awesome.

180
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:45,163
Speaker 0: Yep, and you know, it's like I can't do these other things you're doing cuz.

181
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:47,954
Speaker 0: I got a shift for a part of the day But they didn't care.

182
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,917
Speaker 0: they'd probably do it again.

183
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:53,456
Speaker 1: Plus all I mean the PAX party for the enforcers I mean, I saw the tweets.

184
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:54,682
Speaker 1: people like oh my god.

185
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,250
Speaker 1: I got coup to sign something.

186
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:58,260
Speaker 1: I got you know, Mike and Jerry to sign stuff.

187
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,646
Speaker 1: Apparently was badass time.

188
00:10:59,827 --> 00:10:59,907
Speaker 1: No.

189
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,148
Speaker 1: All right I was asleep.

190
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:03,661
Speaker 0: So we got a list of things that went down at PAX.

191
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,613
Speaker 0: you want to go down this list or we could go semi Chronologically.

192
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:07,636
Speaker 1: go through our.

193
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,102
Speaker 0: my list is not chronological.

194
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,145
Speaker 0: So it's gonna be tough.

195
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,310
Speaker 0: How about your list?

196
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,498
Speaker 1: My list is not in any way chronological.

197
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,310
Speaker 0: So let us just go down the lists and pick stuff.

198
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,909
Speaker 1: All right, let's start right away with the main events because we know we get to PAX.

199
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,710
Speaker 1: Well, no, let's go even further out because we got to do the meta about other cons.

200
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,450
Speaker 1: So you get to PAX and there's no line because they mail out the badges.

201
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:30,383
Speaker 1: Seriously any convention that's more than a couple thousand people.

202
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,010
Speaker 1: You've got to mail out these fucking bad.

203
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I just picked up my badge for anime Boston like a couple hours ago, right?

204
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,670
Speaker 0: There was basically no, you know, not much of a line.

205
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:44,329
Speaker 1: It was like a 10-minute line But even then we had to wait and it was a little bit of trouble anyway.

206
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:49,130
Speaker 1: Obviously they need look at all that they had like 20 staff and this is the Thursday badge pick up.

207
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:54,974
Speaker 1: I don't know what the Friday is gonna be like but like 20 staffers have to sit there Thursday night for like five hours Doing these badges.

208
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,667
Speaker 1: what if they just didn't do that at all and just mailed them at PAX?

209
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:05,035
Speaker 1: every PAX We've walked up to zero line usually even like one staffer who's like, oh Here is says badge.

210
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,641
Speaker 1: Shall I warm says crock pipe.

211
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:07,103
Speaker 1: Yep.

212
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:12,187
Speaker 0: I like a warm crack pipe Let me tell you and hacks is the only con that provides.

213
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:15,805
Speaker 1: Yep So everyone already had their badges and that you know, the thing was gonna open.

214
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:19,497
Speaker 1: we got in an hour early So we walked around all the stuff but there wasn't much to do.

215
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:25,721
Speaker 1: basically all we did was wander around and look at all the stuff and Check out like, you know, like the steel battalion room.

216
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:26,564
Speaker 1: We'll talk about later.

217
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:30,356
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, there's a you know, basically here Here's all the rooms that they have at PAX.

Speaker 0: All right, they got three panel rooms.

224
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:45,621
Speaker 0: We were only.

225
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:51,363
Speaker 0: we were only in the wyvern theaters Sort of medium-sized, you know, the Naga was the biggest.

226
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,089
Speaker 0: I didn't go in the manticore.

227
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,518
Speaker 1: one I thought the manticore was the biggest.

228
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,068
Speaker 0: was the matter remember at all?

229
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,335

Speaker 1: every panel filled up with rare exceptions.

00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:06,076
Speaker 0: There was the Tabletop gaming areas.

00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:06,939
Speaker 0: There are many of them.

234
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:08,705
Speaker 0: There was the watsy areas, of course.

Speaker 0: That was pretty happening.

241
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:36,670
Speaker 1: while it was pretty awesome I got to admit it wasn't even close to as awesome as the one that katsu khan used to have with video told me.

242
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:42,924
Speaker 0: there was the Jam space provided by magfest where you can go and rock some music.

Speaker 1: I were like magfest.

254
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:01,745
Speaker 1: Hells.

255
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:05,078
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah I had heard of the magfest but I did not know.

256
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:05,941
Speaker 1: you realize the.

257
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:10,403
Speaker 1: the official yell of magfest is the colossus yell from the x-men arcade game.

258
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:21,040
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, man, if you're the blob nothing moves you don't go anywhere near magfest, yeah The expo hall which wasn't, you know, we peaked.

259
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,230
Speaker 1: we could look in but they didn't let us in early.

260
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did walk around the expo hall.

261
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:35,210
Speaker 0: It was not really as it had the same sort of level of you know Big-time companies, but I didn't have the quantity that the PAX West Xbox West had the turtle van.

262
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:40,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I walked through the PAX East expo hall basically once looked at a bunch of stuff and that was it.

263
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,100
Speaker 1: I know there was no line to get in.

264
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,290
Speaker 1: We just walked right in the whole con.

265
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,535
Speaker 1: You just walk right in walk around.

266
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:52,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think part of it was there weren't that many crazy new games being I mean what there was Starcraft 2 but everyone cares about it like really there's a tournament of it.

267
00:14:52,550 --> 00:15:01,506
Speaker 1: Yes, but everyone who already cares about it already has a pirated cop or the beta or yeah They're playing like they're hacked beta like they've got their thing a big thing in the expo hall.

268
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:06,332
Speaker 0: number one above everything else is sim 5 Civ 5, Civ 5.

269
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:11,770
Speaker 1: See Civ 3 was a revolution like they changed everything they made like they added culture like it was a brand new game.

270
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:16,700
Speaker 1: Civ 4 was Civ 3 Perfected in my opinion like they took everything that was good in Civ 3.

271
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,945
Speaker 0: Civ 5 is a brand new game again.

272
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is Thing is?

273
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:21,721
Speaker 1: I jumped on the Civ 5 bandwagon.

274
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:22,566
Speaker 1: I was sort of mad.

275
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,939
Speaker 0: on Civ 5 I was like, all right another Civ.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,790
Speaker 1: I knew some of the change but then you saw the same thing.

277
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,068
Speaker 1: I saw that poster of George Washington like he's like.

278
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,802
Speaker 0: And I'm like, yes, George.

279
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,830
Speaker 0: I'll play Civ 5.

280
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,196
Speaker 0: Take me take my money.

281
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:35,698
Speaker 0: Here you go.

282
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:37,726
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I'm walking around the revolution.

283
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:38,770
Speaker 1: I saw that poster.

284
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,992
Speaker 1: I was like, oh shit There's another one for Bismarck with his pointy hat just looking at me like I will disapprove you do not play Civ 5.

285
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:48,170
Speaker 1: But then I saw this other poster of this hex board.

286
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,701
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh is this like a settlers game or something?

287
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:55,473
Speaker 1: Then I realized that's Civ 5 Hexes.

288
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:56,316
Speaker 0: Civ 5 is the win.

289
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:57,481
Speaker 0: actually you could have.

290
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,990
Speaker 0: the reason there was a big line was not to play Civ 5.

291
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,085
Speaker 0: It was to sign up to go see the Civ 5 demo which is sort of private.

292
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:07,590
Speaker 0: our poor friend Scott Johnson God Johnson got to go see the Civ 5.

293
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,451
Speaker 1: However, he got shafted out of it like twice before he got it Like.

294
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:15,010
Speaker 0: he did eventually get it though and he told us about a whole bunch of awesome shit in Civ 5.

295
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,058
Speaker 0: We'll have to maybe interview.

296
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:16,501
Speaker 1: I don't know.

297
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,790
Speaker 1: thing is what am I gonna do?

298
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,319
Speaker 1: We could do like a preview of Civ 5, but here's the deal.

299
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,322
Speaker 1: This is like NS2.

300
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,550
Speaker 1: I'm buying it pre-order sight unseen.

301
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm putting all my eggs in that that might even buy the retail if it comes with a big book.

302
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:31,830
Speaker 1: You know some get some games, you know, like when Smash Brothers Melee came out you're like, you know what?

303
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,658
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be all in from the start.

304
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:34,964
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy this game today.

305
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,230
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play it that entire day.

306
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:40,190
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm not taking a day off at work for Civ 5 because it's gonna be a single-player.

307
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:43,523
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a single-player experience for a while before we multiplayer it.

308
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:45,430
Speaker 0: You want to talk about the other expo hall stuff?

309
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,262
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was some cool stuff in there actually like Monday night combat.

310
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,550
Speaker 0: I'm actually well thing is Monday night combat.

311
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,639
Speaker 0: It looks like a Team Fortress kind of game, right?

312
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,010
Speaker 0: But it's third-person Xbox kind of situation.

313
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:57,756
Speaker 0: Well, there's a class.

314
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:05,262
Speaker 1: it looks and like the play looks and feels just from watching other people play it Exactly, like all those awesome old like quake 2 mods felt.

315
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:05,925
Speaker 0: Yep.

316
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,013
Speaker 1: The only thing it is not an FPS There's a sport.

317
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:11,030
Speaker 0: The only thing with it is as one of those, you know upgrading things.

318
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,690
Speaker 0: But the thing is right the upgrades.

319
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:15,637
Speaker 0: They sort of validate them.

320
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:21,619
Speaker 0: like the way it works is if you're good at playing Monday night combat Which is a sport right a sport.

321
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:25,896
Speaker 0: you get people Virtual people to sponsor you.

322
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:34,283
Speaker 0: like Tiger Woods is sponsored by Nike and they being your sponsors, you know And you know you endorsing their products they give you their better products.

323
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,570
Speaker 0: you get better endorsements as you get better.

324
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:39,842
Speaker 0: So they actually have a metaphor for the upgrades that make sense.

325
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,770
Speaker 0: That doesn't make them feel like cheating.

326
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,529
Speaker 0: I mean is Tiger Woods cheating when he gets better golf clubs from Nike?

327
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:51,790
Speaker 0: No, so am I cheating if I get plus three guns from gun soft in Monday night combat?

328
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,747
Speaker 0: It does it, you know, it doesn't feel like it's unfair.

329
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:57,078
Speaker 1: Well part of it It'll depend on how because they explained it.

330
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,028
Speaker 1: so it'll depend a lot about how the game actually is.

331
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,241
Speaker 1: I mean we watched it and the gameplay looked right up our alley.

332
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:02,863
Speaker 1: It looked twitchy.

333
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:04,570
Speaker 1: It looked like control mattered.

334
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,640
Speaker 1: It looked like there was some asymmetry like the classes and everything.

335
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:10,450
Speaker 1: it had all the look of like a weapons factors.

336
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,739
Speaker 0: I didn't actually play it though.

337
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,150
Speaker 0: So we're gonna see when it comes out.

338
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,583
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try out some demo if they have one and then I'll buy it.

339
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:20,798
Speaker 1: maybe I think it's a game that could foster a Community like a community of players like I really get into it.

340
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,083
Speaker 1: if they start like.

341
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:29,030
Speaker 1: if they made like videos of games and highlights Like what if they made a show for this game that was like the highlights this week from all the servers?

342
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:29,633
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

343
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,670
Speaker 1: They could really do something with this all points bulletin.

344
00:18:33,273 --> 00:18:37,270
Speaker 1: I heard tell that this might be a subscription model game in which case I'm almost done with it.

345
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:37,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just give.

346
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:41,650
Speaker 0: well, there was a very old game called all points bullet and actually played it at fun spot.

347
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to play a game at tilt when I was.

348
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:51,630
Speaker 0: yeah, it's basically a driving game where you pull up behind Criminals and pull the your cop and you pull them over your driving guy litters you pull them over.

349
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,054
Speaker 1: Oh, no, really You know what that game was.

350
00:18:53,316 --> 00:19:02,373
Speaker 1: you crash into every wall because it's really hard then you lose and put another quarter And when you crash you get demerits and too many demerits you get fired and that that cop with the big fat gut and the Cigar yells at you.

351
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's a new game and it's basically it looks like Grand Theft Auto, right?

352
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,033
Speaker 0: except it's versus.

353
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:14,942
Speaker 0: some people are enforcers and some people are criminals and the criminals are trying to crime and the enforcer people are Trying to enforce to uncry man.

354
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:15,426
Speaker 1: I cry.

355
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,050
Speaker 1: Yeah a bite.

356
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:20,630
Speaker 0: So it's like a versus multiplayer grant team Grand Theft Auto and that is cool.

357
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,961
Speaker 0: But if it's a subscription game screw that it depends it.

358
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:30,398
Speaker 1: What if it was what we always wanted like a large Persistent actually massive actually multi.

359
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:31,019
Speaker 1: It's not.

360
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,507
Speaker 0: it's like a four-on-four instanced kind of game.

361
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:34,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what it looked.

362
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,955
Speaker 1: You know, we got to see we.

363
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:40,530
Speaker 1: I mean literally all we saw of it was we watch people play it from online.

364
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, those people all sucked at it.

365
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, I watched one guy like he's.

366
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:55,402
Speaker 1: he gets in a car He's like chasing a criminal and he literally gets in the car drives about two feet and then just like swerves right into a pole We played what was the game called afro bot or something like that?

367
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,450
Speaker 1: It was basically robotron.

368
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:01,790
Speaker 0: It was basically robotron, you know, then we played the multiplayer which is versus robotron.

369
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,092
Speaker 0: Which was?

370
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:02,354
Speaker 0: it was?

371
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,349
Speaker 1: obviously it was a beta like it was on like the Nintendo dev.

372
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:07,126
Speaker 0: It was on the Wii on a Nintendo dev kit, right?

373
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:07,730
Speaker 0: It was okay.

374
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,827
Speaker 1: We spend more time looking at the dev kit like oh, we've never seen one in person.

375
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:11,310
Speaker 1: Check this out.

376
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,361
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this the the single player is robotron Zelda.

377
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:20,930
Speaker 0: like you walk from room to room getting items that let you go to new Areas and you get you know open up secrets.

378
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:29,130
Speaker 0: But you know, I'm just imagine if Zelda Zelda 1 instead of stabbing a sword You use two sticks one to move and one to shoot just like robotron style.

379
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,890
Speaker 0: That's what this game is and that's pretty freaking cool.

380
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:42,003
Speaker 1: I'm excited for that single player and while I would prefer the kind of you know Two sticks they actually did pretty well with the idea that you move with you know The stick but then use the wiimote to kind of like turn and it works.

381
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:43,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does the control work just fine.

382
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:43,833
Speaker 0: It was.

383
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:44,590
Speaker 0: the versus was fun.

384
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:52,738
Speaker 1: It was broken because you know It was like this demo obviously and Alex was like in the upper corner and I just kept shooting bouncy balls at the corner And he's gonna leave.

385
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,488
Speaker 1: I blew myself up.

386
00:20:55,392 --> 00:21:00,950
Speaker 0: You know if Atari combat had better controls than it does on the Atari combat We were the best fucking games ever it does.

387
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:06,447
Speaker 0: But if it had perfect controls You could just lock someone into a corner and keep nailing him and nailing him and nailing him and it be over.

388
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,093
Speaker 1: now because you make The maps different.

389
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,017
Speaker 1: you put constraints in.

390
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:18,929
Speaker 1: the map we played on was not complex enough to offer an interesting sort of game But what this proves is that more and more what I like are these games that are very direct distilled combat between people.

391
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,035
Speaker 0: Well combat.

392
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:20,618
Speaker 0: Yeah.

393
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,790
Speaker 1: Oh, so what was the name of that Yakuza game?

394
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,121
Speaker 1: We were looking at Yakuza because we'd heard.

395
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:27,050
Speaker 1: I heard about this game, but I didn't really think about it.

396
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew there was a game called Yakuza.

397
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:29,530
Speaker 0: I knew it was popular.

398
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,948
Speaker 0: I knew people liked it, but I never played it and they had it at the Sega booth and I played it.

399
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,227
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that it was.

400
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:40,601
Speaker 0: you know At least the newest version is a full Yakuza simulator 100%.

401
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:48,995
Speaker 0: every aspect of Yakuza life from drinking alcohol to playing pool to driving cool cars to everything Yakuza does is fully simulated.

402
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,580
Speaker 0: there is the when you play pool.

403
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:54,993
Speaker 0: it might as well be a full-on billiards game like 100%.

404
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:58,465
Speaker 0: you could take that out of the game and sell it on its own as a billiards game.

405
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,509
Speaker 0: that is better than most.

406
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:08,913
Speaker 1: I Mean I think the moment where I realized I didn't like I was wrong about this game is when Scott You know he plays and he walks into his Hawaiian shirt like you do Yakuza.

407
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,866
Speaker 1: then he walks into a fancy bar and he goes up to the bartender.

408
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:19,073
Speaker 1: the bartender's like, you know He says some things and they sit down and then it gives you this menu of like a hundred different kinds of beer and sake And wine.

409
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:20,017
Speaker 1: so we go down.

410
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:24,596
Speaker 1: Scott buys like this heap of sake and then it gives you like this Multiparagraph explanation of like.

411
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:26,224
Speaker 1: well, this is this kind of sake.

412
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,094
Speaker 1: these kinds of people drink it It tastes like this.

413
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,826
Speaker 1: and then a little bit about the history of like Yakuza drinking.

414
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,115
Speaker 0: and after I drank it I got some experience points.

415
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,345
Speaker 1: You're leveling up yours that Yakuza ways.

416
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:36,610
Speaker 1: I kind of want to be a Yakuza now.

417
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a good game or the very least.

418
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,784
Speaker 1: I want to go to Japan.

419
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:40,990
Speaker 1: We're like a Hawaiian shirt.

420
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:45,430
Speaker 1: Maybe you have like a big fake tattoo and just walk around like the guys in Yakuza and scare everybody.

421
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:53,285
Speaker 0: The only other thing I remember from the expo hall because I didn't spend too much time in there was that Nvidia actually dimmed live demos of its 3d stuff.

422
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I mean I could do with my video shuttered glasses that are wired into the thing and then the screen.

423
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:02,355
Speaker 1: they were wireless Polarized that wasn't.

424
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:06,737
Speaker 0: I thought it was the shuttered ones with the battery But they weren't wired in anything.

425
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,101
Speaker 1: that was the don't steal me wire.

426
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:10,148
Speaker 1: Okay, and it's 3d.

427
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:11,690
Speaker 1: It's just I don't know It's not worth the money yet.

428
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,414
Speaker 1: I mean a weighty.

429
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,606
Speaker 0: it goes deep in but it doesn't pop out.

430
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:24,230
Speaker 0: but that was a Apparently a decision of the game developer not a decision of you know You could make a game where the 3d comes out of the screen But people seem to only do it where it goes deep into the screen.

431
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,299
Speaker 1: I can see why cuz pop out is really disconcerting.

432
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,056
Speaker 1: if pop out and then you change your angle and then like goes off the edge Of the screen it disappears.

433
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it looked great.

434
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:37,190
Speaker 1: It's just My opinion as a gamer is that if you just wait like a year, it'll be ubiquitous.

435
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:44,070
Speaker 1: Just wait until you buy a new computer and the video card has the two DVI outs for 3d and just comes with the glasses.

436
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:45,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, they will come.

437
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:47,070
Speaker 0: I'm gonna wait until it's like a standard.

438
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,569
Speaker 0: It's set in stone not while it's still some flaky thing.

439
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:56,510
Speaker 0: Ati had their a demo of the whatever they call it where you can get a shit ton of monitors on one video card.

440
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:59,470
Speaker 0: They had four HDMI outs coming out of one card.

441
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,671
Speaker 0: It was.

442
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:00,875
Speaker 0: it was pretty ridiculous.

443
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:07,440
Speaker 1: now doing it in like the wall mode like six monitors was kind of annoying because you have the bars But when they play the racing games, there's just.

444
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,730
Speaker 0: I think I think it was eight and they had an SLI.

445
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:18,195
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if ati calls it SLI But they had a two card setup with eight display port cables going to eight ultra sharps in a two by four Right.

446
00:24:18,236 --> 00:24:19,324
Speaker 0: That was pretty impressive.

447
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,510
Speaker 0: But the racing who and who is really gonna get right?

448
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,830
Speaker 0: I mean buying one video card that is for display port outs.

449
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,939
Speaker 0: That's pretty good because you can get two ultra sharps and hook them up frickin sweet.

450
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,582
Speaker 0: Yeah, right getting with three video cards with eight Nobody has eight ultra sharps.

451
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:36,670
Speaker 0: It is not gonna happen.

452
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,395
Speaker 1: However, you know who's gonna use that?

453
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:44,655
Speaker 1: a lot of companies who get demo their games are gonna do that people like in exhibit halls Maybe conventions.

454
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,261
Speaker 1: I think that's not.

455
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,610
Speaker 0: it's not useful for normal people unless you're crazy.

456
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:56,690
Speaker 0: However, the thing didn't have a demo though of a three screen setup, you know, you could do like a racing game Like you're really into racing games or when FPS is support that better.

457
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:59,504
Speaker 1: I'd have to see like how like older FPS is would handle that.

458
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:09,848
Speaker 1: because if I had you know The three for the peripheral vision, you know I was always big back in the quake days of playing with like the 120 fov and the like the fisheye Just so I could see around my back.

459
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:12,416
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the expo.

460
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:15,710
Speaker 1: Oh, there's the warioware DIY, which they didn't play for it.

461
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,675
Speaker 1: People seem to really like it.

462
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:25,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nintendo had a tiny booth with warioware and Pokemon gold and silver which were ubiquitous at the con anyway, so whatever we didn't even bother to wait.

463
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:26,525
Speaker 0: We just said oh look warioware.

464
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,407
Speaker 0: Okay We'll see it one day.

465
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:31,630
Speaker 1: So, you know, what do you do with these kinds of mail all the badges?

466
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,102
Speaker 0: I mean you just go get the badge if you don't have it already like, you know Cuz they don't mail out the panelist badges.

467
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:38,390
Speaker 0: They only mail out the attendee.

468
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,562
Speaker 1: Yep, so we had to go pick up our badges as a result.

469
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,949
Speaker 1: We didn't get a Charlie card.

470
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:46,390
Speaker 1: I just spent like money to get a Charlie ticket that cost more than a Charlie card, whatever.

471
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:53,890
Speaker 0: But anyway, we did manage to get you know, the lanyards which are in the bags of goodies Which are just they're just sitting there and these big bins in the queue room and you just take them.

472
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:54,700
Speaker 0: You can take more than one.

473
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,348
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit.

474
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:58,950
Speaker 1: now You might not think about it, especially, you know, a lot of PAX people don't go to like anime cons.

475
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:06,768
Speaker 1: But fan cons especially anime cons It used to be like the goodie bag would have crazy goodies in it like DVDs of stuff.

476
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:09,259
Speaker 0: the PAX West Goodie bag actually crazy stuff.

477
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:09,982
Speaker 0: I mean it didn't.

478
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:11,530
Speaker 0: it's sort of crazy.

479
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,052
Speaker 0: You know that.

480
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:14,623
Speaker 0: first of all, they were there's the little DS game with the pins.

481
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:15,567
Speaker 0: They didn't have that.

482
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,170
Speaker 0: that was just yeah.

483
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,966
Speaker 1: That was actually sorely lacking via distributed tournament system.

484
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,630
Speaker 0: Yeah the DTS they didn't have.

485
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,043
Speaker 0: Like I remember at PAX West you would get they had a full case of.

486
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,010
Speaker 0: it was Lord of the Rings online the game.

487
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,178
Speaker 0: It was a full game.

488
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,070
Speaker 0: But of course it was a game of the subscription.

489
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:32,841
Speaker 0: No one was giving you a full game.

490
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:34,310
Speaker 0: that really for free.

491
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,194
Speaker 1: Maybe we should find out.

492
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:37,826
Speaker 1: we should put something awesome in those bags like pay to do it.

493
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:38,710
Speaker 2: Yeah, why not?

494
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,335
Speaker 0: So here's what comes in the bag, right?

495
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:43,750
Speaker 0: So you get the program with the awesome art on it, of course, right?

496
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,837
Speaker 0: The program is you know, it's alright.

497
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:49,990
Speaker 0: it has all the information you need about tournaments and schedules and a map.

498
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,902
Speaker 1: It's got the same aesthetic as the PAX West.

499
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:53,190
Speaker 1: one is basically the PAX West.

500
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,210
Speaker 0: It's got a description of every event, you know, and all these things got a lot of notes pages.

501
00:26:57,752 --> 00:27:03,111
Speaker 0: The only thing with this is that they don't give you this is the only place you're gonna have the schedule that you can carry Around.

502
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:05,359
Speaker 0: they don't give you a separate pocket schedule.

503
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,734
Speaker 0: So you have to carry this whole thing around to you and keep you know Referring to it.

504
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:12,370
Speaker 0: if you had a pocket schedule, you could just leave this in your room.

505
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,630
Speaker 1: This is one of the few things where we think, you know, usually we say oh the anime cons could all learn from packs.

506
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,362
Speaker 1: This is one situation where packs could learn from the anime cons.

507
00:27:19,664 --> 00:27:25,556
Speaker 1: a one-page pocket schedule Would just be great and it wouldn't cost that much to stick it in the bag All right, maybe put an ad on it.

508
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,904
Speaker 0: So other than that you get a bunch of flyers.

509
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,719
Speaker 0: Here's one for let's see Magic is a gathering.

510
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,010
Speaker 0: Here's goozex.com, which is a website.

511
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,646
Speaker 0: Oh, this is that sort of scam ish website where you you send you trade games and get points.

512
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:42,320
Speaker 0: you with the points you earn You can get games and they get a cut somehow.

513
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,268
Speaker 1: We're basically giving free advertising to everyone who paid.

514
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:44,650
Speaker 0: I guess.

515
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:50,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway play on whatever Flame on Dolby axon.

516
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,649
Speaker 0: Okay, it's probably some audio gaming thing.

517
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,959
Speaker 0: Cge classic gaming expo 2010.

518
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,164
Speaker 0: Oh, where is this?

519
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:58,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe we should go Vegas.

520
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:01,001
Speaker 1: Alright new egg was in the room.

521
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,370
Speaker 1: Yeah new egg was in the house.

522
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,390
Speaker 0: We actually talked to an Intel guy about some chips and stuff.

523
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were asked him why the smallest ones like the ones you want on your like my home media PC don't have HDMI out.

524
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,377
Speaker 1: He was like, yeah, I know it kind of sucks.

525
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,026
Speaker 1: I think it technologists not there yet.

526
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:17,940
Speaker 0: Yeah These people are selling some computers.

527
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,587
Speaker 0: He explosion man that games.

528
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:23,338
Speaker 0: Alright, and Here's the only interesting things that were in the bag.

529
00:28:23,358 --> 00:28:34,330
Speaker 0: Alright, so first of all, right you Got this Magic magic money the wasting magic the gathering and the thing is most of the time they give you like some boosters.

530
00:28:34,692 --> 00:28:36,802
Speaker 0: You know, maybe they give you a booster.

531
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,478
Speaker 1: what you throw away or give to a kid He's waiting to do with a booster.

532
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:40,870
Speaker 1: This is an entire day.

533
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,264
Speaker 0: This is enough cards to play magic the gathering and not only that.

534
00:28:44,284 --> 00:28:45,830
Speaker 0: it comes with the rules how to play.

535
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:46,896
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta read those.

536
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,665
Speaker 1: cuz the last time I read him was revised.

537
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:52,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, and look at this Here is a full 40 card deck, right?

538
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,149
Speaker 0: It's all green.

539
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:58,707
Speaker 1: They give you a 15 forests, you know, and then they give you any artifacts or just green.

540
00:28:58,888 --> 00:28:59,530
Speaker 0: No, it's just green.

541
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:12,170
Speaker 0: Right, they give you 15 and they give you a whole bunch of creatures and then like a handful of instances it's like if you play that Magic game that's on the Xbox is the same kind of deck that you're gonna find in that game.

542
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,976
Speaker 0: You know a real simple straightforward deck.

543
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:18,170
Speaker 1: What was amazing is, you know walking around the con like before it opened just out.

544
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:25,832
Speaker 1: Everyone's playing magic like people had magic out and they were playing these decks and a lot of these weren't people who brought magic cards With them.

545
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:29,750
Speaker 0: there's are people who just busted these decks out and played this magic that they got.

546
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:37,730
Speaker 1: Multiple groups that I ran into were like two guys like us who had played magic in the past Teaching someone who had never played it how it worked with these decks.

547
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,410
Speaker 0: And the thing is I got the green one, right which is random.

548
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:54,670
Speaker 0: I want if I would have could have chosen I would have chosen green but the I just picked it in video bag, you know, and this is the one that was in there and I could have gone through back to the bag bin and looted and gotten one of every different color.

549
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:57,043
Speaker 0: I think there were five different decks that were available.

550
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:58,430
Speaker 0: I think you got a different color.

551
00:29:58,611 --> 00:29:59,255
Speaker 1: I didn't even look.

552
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:00,181
Speaker 0: you didn't look I don't know.

553
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:01,207
Speaker 1: I think Emily took my bag home.

554
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:01,549
Speaker 1: I don't know.

555
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:05,681
Speaker 0: Oh, whatever, but yeah full playable deck of magic cards.

556
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,206
Speaker 0: That was a good call by them.

557
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:08,710
Speaker 0: Not that I support the playing of magic.

558
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:19,262
Speaker 0: The final thing that was in the bag was this this very important card, which I have kept that the omega-thon card The omega-thon card big change at PAX East from PAX West.

559
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,068
Speaker 0: I can see why they changed.

560
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,601
Speaker 0: it Is that they used to.

561
00:30:23,742 --> 00:30:28,754
Speaker 0: when you pre-reg for PAX West There'd be a box that you would check and say yes I want to be an omega.

562
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:34,106
Speaker 0: not the problem with this was that You know, they would call people up and say you wanna be omega.

563
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:34,810
Speaker 0: not, you know.

564
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,750
Speaker 0: You check the box and they would say oh no, you know, they couldn't get people to confirm.

565
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,244
Speaker 0: It was a lot of work calling people on the phone such and such and such.

566
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:44,670
Speaker 1: I still can't understand that.

567
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,752
Speaker 1: I mean if Mike and Jerry called me like hey, you're an omega not I would just been like People, you know?

568
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:53,038
Speaker 0: not people had to prepare to be an omega.

569
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:55,144
Speaker 0: not they would train right and they.

570
00:30:55,285 --> 00:31:01,384
Speaker 0: it was very inaccessible very difficult And people might not show up to the convention unreliable.

571
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:02,709
Speaker 0: It's a big pain in the ass.

572
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:08,730
Speaker 0: So this way anyone who is applying to be an omega not does so at the con, you know, they're there.

573
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:13,585
Speaker 1: But even then so they passed him out, you know You you toss these in as you walked into.

574
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,550
Speaker 0: that was a problem.

575
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,749
Speaker 0: Is that you toss them in the bag as you go to the keynote?

576
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:22,089
Speaker 0: So the the entrance to the keynote was slowed down by people tossing cards in the back.

577
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:22,510
Speaker 1: It was great.

578
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,433
Speaker 1: We get there, you know, basically, you know We got in early.

579
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:36,950
Speaker 1: as we wander around and then we hear this noise And we were standing like in the front of where the main events are gonna be and we see the line Being led in by all these enforcers walking backwards like holding them barely at bay.

580
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:37,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

581
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:46,301
Speaker 1: And then we see this one enforcer with this little basket to catch the omega-thon cards and he looks around like oh shit Robert coo actually came over with a big bin.

582
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,507
Speaker 1: He's like, alright, I got this.

583
00:31:47,668 --> 00:31:55,369
Speaker 0: Yeah But you know The point was is that this is a better system in all ways except for the fact that they had to slow down that.

584
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:56,613
Speaker 1: and no But here's the amazing part.

585
00:31:56,673 --> 00:32:01,249
Speaker 1: So people took these filled them out and put them in as they walked in.

586
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:05,847
Speaker 0: and Then what about people who didn't go to the King, you know, well, you gotta want it.

587
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,254
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the omega-thon You gotta want it.

588
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:08,623
Speaker 1: They can't just make it really easy.

589
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,750
Speaker 1: You've got to want it in some way.

590
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,810
Speaker 0: I mean if you the pigeons not get just jumping into your I think it would have been better to do it the same way.

591
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,870
Speaker 0: That like baseball stadiums have the all-star voting that she just had bins about that were omega-thon.

592
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:22,578
Speaker 1: I know cuz look even There's the point I was gonna do even with you.

593
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:25,690
Speaker 1: turn them in as you walk into the event where they will announce them.

594
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:28,699
Speaker 1: They had like six people who were called up not be there.

595
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,388
Speaker 1: Remember they recalled they called up the alts.

596
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:33,418
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know what was up with that.

597
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:34,606
Speaker 0: I don't know what's up with that either.

598
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:37,424
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter They got the people they needed.

599
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:38,410
Speaker 0: the omega-thon happened.

600
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,309
Speaker 1: I like the fact that it was all co-op all the way through.

601
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:42,615
Speaker 1: I think that was a really.

602
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:45,910
Speaker 1: it gave the omega-thon at PAX East a totally different style.

603
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing was I felt it was.

604
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:50,879
Speaker 0: while it was a different style and the co-op was awesome It was less epic.

605
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:51,788
Speaker 1: It was dated.

606
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:55,480
Speaker 0: They did one omega-thon round on its own as an event.

607
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:58,910
Speaker 0: omega-thon round two was before the concerts on Friday.

608
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:03,772
Speaker 0: Round three was before the concerts on Saturday and the final round was the closing ceremony I want.

609
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,342
Speaker 1: it was good that there was one.

610
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,489
Speaker 0: there was one less round.

611
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,064
Speaker 1: Yeah usually five round but it was good that they put them before these big events like you.

612
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,153
Speaker 1: go to the concert and You see the omega-thon.

613
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,880
Speaker 1: They didn't take up panel room space.

614
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,506
Speaker 1: They weren't like out and about.

615
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,610
Speaker 0: it was also less epic.

616
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:19,450
Speaker 0: It wasn't like this thing that was going on that you would follow.

617
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:29,488
Speaker 1: They didn't have the big board with all the people's faces and they would cross them out, you know I think my guess I didn't actually ask you because notice how they didn't say anything about the omega-thon for a long time and then Suddenly they busted out.

618
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:42,781
Speaker 1: My guess is they were planning on not doing an omega-thon the first year and just you know Making sure the con happened and then when they realized that it was gonna easily be bigger than PAX OS Like it is going to be as I go said the real packs.

619
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:44,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were like, ah shit.

620
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:45,350
Speaker 1: We gotta have an omega-thon.

621
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,372
Speaker 0: Yep so they did it.

622
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:47,717
Speaker 1: either that or not.

623
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:55,847
Speaker 1: once we now that we know what the final round was because while the other three rounds were Kind of met the final round was I would say the most epic final round they've ever had.

624
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,513
Speaker 1: like that was crazy I don't know.

625
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,303
Speaker 0: I think that the versus excite bike was the most epic round.

626
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:02,915
Speaker 0: I'm sure plus there were rounds We haven't seen.

627
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,123
Speaker 1: well final round.

628
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:04,969
Speaker 1: I mean the ones before.

629
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:05,469
Speaker 1: that I don't know.

630
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:10,047
Speaker 1: The excite bike one definitely was awesome and I see a lot of people talking about it.

631
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:11,777
Speaker 1: I guess only time will tell.

632
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,568
Speaker 1: maybe they were equally epic in different ways.

633
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:24,889
Speaker 1: Maybe alright, so So the keynote, you know, we all file in it's standing room only Originally, they weren't letting people go out to pee and I gotta tell you I really had to pee.

634
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,940
Speaker 0: I actually walked out in the middle of Will's keynote And I soon and you wouldn't be able to get back in.

635
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,909
Speaker 1: Yes, but then as I walked out there's an enforcer.

636
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,339
Speaker 1: I was like, dude, I'm a special guest.

637
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:38,668
Speaker 1: I got a pee and he's like, I'll let you back in Mmm, and he totally let me back in and I got back.

638
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,455
Speaker 1: But we'll eat and you know, well, we'll.

639
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,882
Speaker 1: wheaten to pronounce it correctly gave the keynote.

640
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,607
Speaker 1: He's given a packs keynote before.

641
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:49,396
Speaker 1: I'm curious Specifically like on the inside why they picked.

642
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:53,550
Speaker 1: well because it at least from the way he told it they kind of threw this at him.

643
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,882
Speaker 1: He was like, I don't know if I want to do it.

644
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:55,549
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll do it.

645
00:34:56,813 --> 00:35:00,778
Speaker 1: so I wonder if it was because Maybe they couldn't get anyone in time.

646
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:06,882
Speaker 1: Maybe like I don't know what the planning process was actually for paxies, but He gave a good keynote in the end though.

647
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:07,665
Speaker 0: It was okay.

648
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:08,650
Speaker 0: It wasn't epic though.

649
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:09,354
Speaker 0: It wasn't like.

650
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,766
Speaker 0: oh man, that was the greatest, you know, it was just.

651
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:12,630
Speaker 0: it was no cakey, you know.

652
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:12,931
Speaker 0: It was.

653
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:19,259
Speaker 1: I'll admit it was kind of a letdown from the last two packs keynotes We saw because those were just one there.

654
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,243
Speaker 1: They had like slides.

655
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,170
Speaker 1: They were much more kind of professionally delivered.

656
00:35:22,674 --> 00:35:24,369
Speaker 1: There was much less woo game going on.

657
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:34,178
Speaker 1: Well, I love you All right But you played the woo game the game that we've done everything in our power to crush Since we started doing panels.

658
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,109
Speaker 1: your that whole part of your speech was basically Final Fantasy and the crowd goes.

659
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:43,409
Speaker 1: You were just tricking the crowd into saying woo.

660
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,370
Speaker 1: You were taking social currency and throwing it at them and then getting that to reflect back on you.

661
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,237
Speaker 1: And I used to do that at panels.

662
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:50,920
Speaker 1: I don't anymore.

663
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,502
Speaker 1: I know better.

664
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:52,165
Speaker 0: Yes.

665
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,430
Speaker 0: Do not play the woo game.

666
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,849
Speaker 0: It was very disappointing to see the woo game played at the keynote of all places.

667
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got understand like a small lowbrow panel playing the woo game.

668
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,970
Speaker 1: I guess it's just the last two keynotes that packs West.

669
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:11,626
Speaker 1: I was like deeply inspired by them because they were all kind of the same story of like a narrative of Why gaming is important like not just why it's important to us as gamers.

670
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:12,310
Speaker 1: That's a big part of it.

671
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,230
Speaker 1: But really like gaming is important in ways beyond everything in this room and they were really inspired.

672
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:22,226
Speaker 1: I remember being moved almost to tears tears in a row just like feeling like this is it?

673
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:35,080
Speaker 1: and that feeling After I remembered oh, yeah I'm here to play some games but But definitely like you felt that like that catch in the heart of like gaming matters and we're on the cusp of gaming becoming You know the great the next great media after writing.

674
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, and well we tried to say gaming man He did.

675
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:45,489
Speaker 1: he said that he said it really well But then he got it kept going with the woo game for a while and then he did that whole.

676
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:54,810
Speaker 1: you know spoil some games for people bid and I feel like His keynote should have been shorter and just done the inspiring part or he should have had more inspiring things to say.

677
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a good keynote.

678
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:57,020
Speaker 1: Don't get us wrong.

679
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,562
Speaker 1: It was good.

680
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:58,185
Speaker 1: It was solid.

681
00:36:58,426 --> 00:36:59,209
Speaker 1: people really liked it.

682
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:03,485
Speaker 1: It's just I'm comparing it to the two keynotes prior that I think were better.

683
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:06,412
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway Let's see.

684
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,337
Speaker 0: What else was going to?

685
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,346
Speaker 0: Oh immediately following the keynote, right?

686
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:10,350
Speaker 0: I attempted my vision.

687
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,242
Speaker 1: So we had a vision right and the vision was you know gave in taiko.

688
00:37:14,262 --> 00:37:19,499
Speaker 1: they come out every year and they play that song Every day, I'm hustling every day.

689
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,412
Speaker 1: I'm hustling right so they Play.

690
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:32,566
Speaker 0: vision was to have the entire keynote and main events singing the song Before the song played and then singing with the song and then they would come out and it'd be epic.

691
00:37:32,747 --> 00:37:32,828
Speaker 0: and

692
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:45,969
Speaker 1: we learned how to Do this like we've tried this sort of thing a long time ago when we were young and stupid at Otakon and it failed Miserably, but then no years of experience and a college humor video of a lone dancing nut job causes a movement of how to make a movement in a crowd.

693
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:53,173
Speaker 1: so we just took that exact method and we planned it and we had people around who were waiting for the queue and Scott was gonna start.

694
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:54,317
Speaker 0: I was worried right.

695
00:37:54,337 --> 00:38:05,266
Speaker 0: I was worried because I was you know during the time in between the end of the keynote in the beginning of the Q&A They might have Right played some music or something and I would have to overpower this music with the vision

696
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:11,590
Speaker 1: or it might have been a long Wait, like what if they attend kill difficulties like Pax is known for and you know you started and then there's a half hour.

697
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:16,730
Speaker 0: It's not gonna be able to keep me going for a half hour or it'll become the most epic thing ever like Bohemian Rhapsody.

698
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,730
Speaker 1: But that will talk about that.

699
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:23,186
Speaker 0: The thing is the worst case scenario happened immediately as the keynote applause ended.

700
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,530
Speaker 0: They started playing the song.

701
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:27,538
Speaker 0: So what was I supposed to do?

702
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:28,961
Speaker 0: but vision was a failure?

703
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:30,646
Speaker 1: I'm sad, but I'm also glad.

704
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:32,290
Speaker 1: I'm sad because the vision failed.

705
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:37,730
Speaker 1: It's always sad when a vision dies But I'm glad because there was zero technical failure.

706
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,347
Speaker 1: It was the perfect most professional transition from keynote Q&A.

707
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,810
Speaker 1: Yep, now the Q&A at PAX is special and we're trying to know a bunch of our friends weren't gonna go.

708
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,880
Speaker 1: They're like, I don't want to see some Q&A people.

709
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,317
Speaker 0: always there's no reason they go to the second Q&A But you gotta go to the first one.

710
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:53,685
Speaker 1: I don't know if I missed the first one.

711
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,154
Speaker 1: I would go to the second one That's right.

712
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:57,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be true if they scheduled a panel during the first one.

713
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,505
Speaker 1: Plus, you know funny things happen at the second one.

714
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:01,990
Speaker 1: Like it's a good deal It's more, you know, what do you care about at the con?

715
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:08,090
Speaker 1: We had to you know, remind everyone that the Q&A at PAX is not just fanboys asking stupid questions.

716
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,262
Speaker 1: It's people usually asking good questions.

717
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:16,210
Speaker 1: Like I'd say there's a 60 to 70 percent hit rate of good questions versus fanboy.

718
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,575
Speaker 0: It's not just questions.

719
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:24,062
Speaker 0: either people get up and do stuff or will announce things You know like at the last PAX Prime those guys brought a cardboard cutout.

720
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:26,654
Speaker 1: other friend who couldn't come and they're like Can we do it again?

721
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:31,592
Speaker 0: dude in front of me in line called his friend who couldn't make it on the phone and everyone Yells.

722
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:34,140
Speaker 0: so it was someone's birthday and we all said happy birthday.

723
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,902
Speaker 0: asshole.

724
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:39,890
Speaker 1: at the second Q&A like someone or it was one of the Other events someone was like, will you play Thunderstone with me?

725
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,992
Speaker 1: This game is up you guys's alley and then they you know from the Q&A They organized.

726
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:51,597
Speaker 1: so the people on stage and this guy and someone else in the audience at another microphone about to ask a question All scheduled a game of Thunderstone.

727
00:39:51,617 --> 00:39:52,842
Speaker 1: then they all met and they played it.

728
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:56,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of a. it's like this Give-and-take like the knuckle crack happens.

729
00:39:57,302 --> 00:40:00,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, the knuckle crack very important Tradition.

730
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:01,817
Speaker 1: no one Rick rolled the audience.

731
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,704
Speaker 1: No, no one Rick roll surprised.

732
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:04,266
Speaker 0: Yeah.

733
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:06,995
Speaker 1: No, but I Pulled off some epic.

734
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,021
Speaker 0: It wasn't that epic.

735
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:08,664
Speaker 1: It was epic.

736
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,810
Speaker 0: Look at how epic was it?

737
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:16,330
Speaker 1: It was epic in the sense that you know, we got it up online and the first planned it Well in advance, it wasn't like some improvisational genius.

738
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,095
Speaker 1: The thing is we planned it so far ahead, but you know this sort of thing There's such a fine line between.

739
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:22,258
Speaker 1: that is awesome.

740
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,322
Speaker 1: And you're a douchebag.

741
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:29,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the line is so narrow So basically we're doing this action castle panel and I said, you know what right?

742
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:33,290
Speaker 0: I told Jared the creator of action castle Look, you should go to the Q&A you mean?

743
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:35,593
Speaker 1: action Castle.

744
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:47,054
Speaker 0: I told them look you can go to the Q&A go up and as your question just stand up and say welcome to action castle And start playing it and then after a few minutes or whatever after your time is up You know.

745
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:49,549
Speaker 0: basically don't stand there forever Just say you know.

746
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,700
Speaker 0: This concludes the trial version of action castle.

747
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:56,374
Speaker 0: to play the full version come to the Wyvern theater on Sunday 30.

748
00:40:56,374 --> 00:41:00,793
Speaker 1: Scott tried to convince him like four times to do this and at PAX the last moment He's like, will you do it?

749
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,355
Speaker 1: and Jared's like.

750
00:41:01,797 --> 00:41:03,082
Speaker 1: basically Jared said Scott.

751
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:04,086
Speaker 1: I'm in fact a wuss.

752
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:07,170
Speaker 1: I'm not going to do this I'm going to be a total wuss and fam.

753
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:08,539
Speaker 0: So I said do you want me to do it?

754
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,170
Speaker 0: and he was like, it would be awesome if you did it.

755
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:10,833
Speaker 0: So I did it.

756
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:13,464
Speaker 1: so, you know, we're sitting there and Scott lines up and he goes.

757
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:18,100
Speaker 1: you can see the YouTube video But the crowd went fucking nuts.

758
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,688
Speaker 0: people seem to really like it far more than I expect.

759
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,013
Speaker 1: well taiko It's funny cuz.

760
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:22,777
Speaker 1: taiko got it.

761
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:23,722
Speaker 0: I knew he would get it.

762
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:25,310
Speaker 0: I knew that Mike wouldn't get it at all.

763
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,832
Speaker 1: He's Mike.

764
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,424
Speaker 1: I think he got it at least enough.

765
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,650
Speaker 1: He was more playing to the crowd.

766
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:30,457
Speaker 1: I mean his whole.

767
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,930
Speaker 1: what the fuck do you want from me?

768
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:38,348
Speaker 1: That was good for the vibe of the whole thing I guess but it went on the perfect amount of time like the crowd was losing it when he's like.

769
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,231
Speaker 1: what the fuck do you Want from me?

770
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,178
Speaker 1: like I don't know how to what the fuck?

771
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:51,089
Speaker 1: the crowd just like the microphone on my camera was like busted By how loud everybody was and just at the moment when it was about to go on too long It was gonna move from awesome to douchebag.

772
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:52,274
Speaker 1: He did.

773
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:54,783
Speaker 1: Mike is like what can you say to end this?

774
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,930
Speaker 2: and then he's like say whatever will make him stop.

775
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,293
Speaker 0: He's like quit.

776
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:00,518
Speaker 1: and then you did.

777
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:01,601
Speaker 1: it was so epic.

778
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,110
Speaker 1: I was so happy about that and it was on joystick.

779
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:08,026
Speaker 1: So yeah, very action castle and you know people lined up.

780
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:12,999
Speaker 0: Yep So I guess that about wraps up that morning, right?

781
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:13,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

782
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,264
Speaker 0: All right.

783
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,427
Speaker 1: Let's leave it recording.

784
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:16,130
Speaker 1: Let's do another thing.

785
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,259
Speaker 0: Let's do the tabletop area.

786
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, go through all the games you were playing.

787
00:42:20,428 --> 00:42:20,749
Speaker 0: All right.

788
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:30,503
Speaker 1: So as we were want to do at PAX is we spend a lot of time in tabletop because it's quiet For we can play some games that we like to play with sit down.

789
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:30,924
Speaker 1: Yep.

790
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:31,466
Speaker 0: It's all.

791
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:32,449
Speaker 0: it's a hot place to be.

792
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:37,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one of my favorite parts of packs other than the concerts the Q&A and the keynote.

793
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:38,917
Speaker 0: So we played a bunch of games.

794
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:42,150
Speaker 0: so we go over there and I checked out this game Bacchus banquet.

795
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:50,628
Speaker 0: But I didn't get to play it because I ended up teaching some awesome The listener rising through the ranks chase Gordon and his friends how to play.

796
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:51,050
Speaker 1: he's Gordon.

797
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:57,010
Speaker 0: You're like one of my favorite fans at this point Yeah, so I taught him and his friends how to play and then I got roped into actually playing.

798
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,757
Speaker 0: It's a rim played Bacchus banquet.

799
00:42:58,797 --> 00:42:58,958
Speaker 1: Yep.

800
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,203
Speaker 0: Tell us about Bacchus back.

801
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,750
Speaker 1: So Bacchus bankruptcy way back.

802
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,876
Speaker 0: We picked it up based on the theme alone.

803
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:08,670
Speaker 1: We bought another game that the cover is basically bohemian bot not bohemian bot.

804
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:17,990
Speaker 1: That's the movie that Emily's freedomism by is a bot And the theme of that game is you're all Roman nobles trying to get all your shit together.

805
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:22,470
Speaker 1: Get the fuck out of Rome before the Visigoth comes and kills you and you got to get to Carthage.

806
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,012
Speaker 0: You're it safe.

807
00:43:23,193 --> 00:43:30,419
Speaker 1: The cover is this this guy all fat with wine and women going great And in the background Rome is burning.

808
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,126
Speaker 1: Yep, like over the ocean.

809
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:32,970
Speaker 1: It's so beautiful.

810
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,638
Speaker 1: So that game was not actually that good.

811
00:43:35,658 --> 00:43:37,183
Speaker 1: This game is much better.

812
00:43:37,263 --> 00:43:39,650
Speaker 1: Bacchus banquet the glory and gluttony of Rome.

813
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:44,630
Speaker 1: So everybody plays as up like a character from the Caligula era.

814
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:49,906
Speaker 1: Awesome, and everyone has a secret role, but one person plays openly as Caligula.

815
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:51,330
Speaker 0: Can I be Caligula's horse?

816
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,513
Speaker 1: So let me tell you what.

817
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:53,596
Speaker 1: Caligula.

818
00:43:53,957 --> 00:44:02,723
Speaker 1: the the graphic on the card, you know your identity card like Octavius or whatever Caligula's card is one of the funniest goddamn things I've ever seen.

819
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:11,790
Speaker 1: like you look at this thing and you cannot help but laugh all right, so Caligula plays openly everyone else plays secretly and It's kind of a every round, you know?

820
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:18,587
Speaker 1: You put seven cards up and some of them are like a dish and some of them are wine and some of them are poison and stuff like this.

821
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:26,422
Speaker 1: and You're you have a score that is your belt buckle Yeah, and if it great you keep having to widen it the more you eat and drink.

822
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,268
Speaker 1: if it goes above ten you die.

823
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:33,110
Speaker 1: So poison just fills your belt buckle like nine points.

824
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,850
Speaker 0: Oh, so you gotta have zero to and you can handle the poison.

825
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:42,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, and some things can make it go down like having sex Or taking a nap.

826
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:43,912
Speaker 1: And it's this.

827
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:44,414
Speaker 1: dinner parties.

828
00:44:44,454 --> 00:44:49,330
Speaker 1: every round one player whoever's the active player picks three cards openly from the table.

829
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,600
Speaker 1: So maybe a poison a day and the dishes to like the.

830
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,131
Speaker 1: you have goals like one player will win if he eats just eight Dishes.

831
00:44:56,272 --> 00:44:57,034
Speaker 1: that's all he wants.

832
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:01,330
Speaker 1: one player want one card wants like three points of wine and four dishes.

833
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:03,263
Speaker 1: Caligula has these different.

834
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:04,190
Speaker 1: everyone wants different stuff.

835
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:09,110
Speaker 1: But some of the dishes are like a lobster belt one and it counts as one dish.

836
00:45:09,671 --> 00:45:16,910
Speaker 1: One of the dishes is an entire deer and it's just a plate with this deer like laying on it and it's five points.

837
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:22,608
Speaker 0: So widens your belt buckle by half the way, but it only counts as one dish, but half kills you.

838
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:25,941
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so so that's a bad one to get depending.

839
00:45:26,001 --> 00:45:28,430
Speaker 1: so you pick the three and then you shuffle them up.

840
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,438
Speaker 1: You put one face down on your sheet.

841
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:34,914
Speaker 1: You're saying I will eat this one On my turn.

842
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:36,078
Speaker 1: then you take one.

843
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:37,382
Speaker 1: you say I'm discarding this one.

844
00:45:37,642 --> 00:45:39,950
Speaker 1: you take one and offer it to another player as a gift.

845
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:43,190
Speaker 1: They can choose to either eat it right then flip it over.

846
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,545
Speaker 0: So they have a one in three chance of knowing what it is basically.

847
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:47,670
Speaker 0: they know it's one of those three.

848
00:45:48,021 --> 00:45:53,769
Speaker 1: Yes so they can either flip it over and apply it to themselves immediately or gift it to someone else who hasn't had it yet.

849
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:59,049
Speaker 1: if Everyone regifts whoever was the active player has to eat it.

850
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:04,154
Speaker 2: But so you want to To become.

851
00:46:04,174 --> 00:46:08,450
Speaker 1: there's only one way to become the active player and that is to accept a gift and not die.

852
00:46:09,992 --> 00:46:16,102
Speaker 1: and the only other part of the game really is that Everyone has a special ability like a card you draw randomly.

853
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:18,570
Speaker 1: You can use it once in the entire game.

854
00:46:18,872 --> 00:46:20,062
Speaker 1: you just flip it over and use it.

855
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:30,729
Speaker 1: and there are things like take the card that the active player was gonna keep and use it on yourself or Take a card that was gifted to you and force whoever gifted it to you to eat it right there.

856
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:34,882
Speaker 1: If you die, you just you throw away your card.

857
00:46:34,902 --> 00:46:35,284
Speaker 1: you died.

858
00:46:35,304 --> 00:46:36,789
Speaker 1: you draw another player card and keep going.

859
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,515
Speaker 1: Oh whoever makes their goal You can still win.

860
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:42,590
Speaker 0: like if you get close to your goal people are gonna attack you you're gonna die.

861
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,210
Speaker 0: You're gonna get sent back to zero, but everyone might get sent back to zero.

862
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,610
Speaker 0: So being close to winning isn't necessarily close to winning.

863
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can get killed and everyone is secret except Caligula plays openly.

864
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:53,849
Speaker 1: so you can try to you know.

865
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:55,195
Speaker 1: Con people into.

866
00:46:55,477 --> 00:46:58,430
Speaker 0: so what if Caligula dies, so if Caligula soap, here's the deal.

867
00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:02,030
Speaker 1: There are two women to those roles and all they want is a bunch of gifts.

868
00:47:02,712 --> 00:47:07,930
Speaker 1: There's like three old men and two other women and they just want to eat and drink in different quantities of food and wine.

869
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:14,210
Speaker 1: Caligula wants to eat some and drink a whole bunch or if any three people die he wins.

870
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:23,725
Speaker 1: Then there are the three conspirators if Caligula dies or if there are three daggers Which is one of the gifts in play at the same time.

871
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:28,425
Speaker 1: They all win Mmm, so they're trying to get the daggers in play or feed man.

872
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:29,570
Speaker 2: That would have helped Rome a lot.

873
00:47:31,911 --> 00:47:35,733
Speaker 1: No, Caligula, okay, but it's basically Citadels.

874
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:39,570
Speaker 1: it is not a good game from game theory, you know our beyond candyland panel.

875
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:40,193
Speaker 1: It is just.

876
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:41,157
Speaker 0: but would you.

877
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:43,850
Speaker 0: would you play instead of all my girls or would you pick citadel?

878
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,924
Speaker 1: They're both important because they're a party game.

879
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:46,630
Speaker 1: They're really fun.

880
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:55,478
Speaker 1: They're the who poison the cup game and you can if you get into it in roleplay and It's citadels without the building part of the game.

881
00:47:55,558 --> 00:47:58,730
Speaker 1: It's just the poison in the cup, you know second-guessing.

882
00:47:58,831 --> 00:47:59,535
Speaker 0: So would you play?

883
00:47:59,555 --> 00:48:00,038
Speaker 0: would you picks?

884
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,572
Speaker 0: if you're sitting there and citadels and Bacchus Bank Which one did you pick?

885
00:48:02,653 --> 00:48:07,510
Speaker 1: I would play Bacchus bank you it with because the building part is not super fun in citadels.

886
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:10,425
Speaker 1: All right, however, citadels, you know can have six or seven people.

887
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:11,310
Speaker 1: Bacchus banquet goes up.

888
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,187
Speaker 1: I think it's three to five.

889
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:13,776
Speaker 0: So I played ticket to ride.

890
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:17,270
Speaker 0: like I said and I remembered that game pretty much comes down to what routes you draw.

891
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:19,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the rest is pretty obvious what to do.

892
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:37,128
Speaker 0: and it just comes and if there's if two people have pretty equal routes It comes down to like luck of drawing more routes Which is sort of mitigated by the fact that you draw three and you only have to keep one at most yeah, and at least but you can keep all three and You know the colors of the cars, you know, you might get lucky like oh you need a yellow route.

893
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:38,153
Speaker 0: so bad It could just be yelling.

894
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:38,375
Speaker 0: Yell.

895
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:38,616
Speaker 0: Yell.

896
00:48:38,656 --> 00:48:38,857
Speaker 0: Yell.

897
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:39,179
Speaker 0: Yell.

898
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,103
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe it happens.

899
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:41,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's still fun though.

900
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:46,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still a fun game, but it's not a great quality, you know skilled game.

901
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,567
Speaker 1: We saw some other listeners right next to us during all this playing learning how to play and then playing Agricola.

902
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,676
Speaker 1: That's good I'm so I gotta play some more Agricola.

903
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,439
Speaker 1: I really like that game.

904
00:48:53,459 --> 00:48:54,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

905
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:55,527
Speaker 0: We want to get the expansion.

906
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:57,876
Speaker 1: So we played Stone Age vs.

907
00:48:58,016 --> 00:48:58,739
Speaker 1: Future Tech.

908
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,361
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

909
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,610
Speaker 0: Well, it's called time streams, right?

910
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:08,857
Speaker 0: This is a versus non collectible card game that was supposed to play like a collectible card game From the look of it.

911
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:10,165
Speaker 1: Anyway, Scott pulls this out.

912
00:49:10,185 --> 00:49:17,889
Speaker 0: He's written the rules I'm flipping through the cards and I've got the future to get tech and he has the caveman tech and I'm like, alright Well, how the hell do we play this game?

913
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,801
Speaker 0: The rules are written so poorly and independently.

914
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,010
Speaker 1: the game itself is actually a cool concept.

915
00:49:23,411 --> 00:49:31,258
Speaker 1: You build kind of this board of like days like you build it out and there's actions and then you go through the whole thing Again, kind of playing out the actions.

916
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:36,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, so imagine if you have a bunch of cards, you know It's normally a magic card right as a for a Dominion card is text on it.

917
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:42,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Imagine if the cards had two texts or some of them had one text and some of them had the other texts.

918
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:54,090
Speaker 0: So there's the play action which happens when you add the card to the game and there's the score action Which happens after you're done with the whole playing of every card and you just go through scoring everything.

919
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,195
Speaker 0: They all do something different.

920
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:58,068
Speaker 1: So you build a machine and then the machine runs.

921
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, and while you're building the machine you do funky stuff.

922
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:05,123
Speaker 1: Also now that mechanic is awesome I think we should make a game like that some sort of like.

923
00:50:05,365 --> 00:50:06,210
Speaker 1: I want to be good.

924
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:07,634
Speaker 0: Good fundamental idea.

925
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:14,894
Speaker 0: the game itself terrible that the words on the cards poorly written the rules poorly written the game of repeat cards Too like it was just.

926
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:17,866
Speaker 0: yeah, the game didn't really have a lot of strategy or anything.

927
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:18,770
Speaker 0: The art was good though.

928
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:20,980
Speaker 0: The art was nice, but the game very bad.

929
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:22,990
Speaker 1: mainly the theme had nothing to do with the game.

930
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:23,693
Speaker 1: The theme was just.

931
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:26,285
Speaker 1: it was tacked on to the degree that it was not even there.

932
00:50:26,305 --> 00:50:32,622
Speaker 0: Yep Stops also in the tabletop area right a guy we know from New York.

933
00:50:32,722 --> 00:50:35,370
Speaker 0: right good friends sort of I guess where you know.

934
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:38,130
Speaker 0: He's in the nerd the nerd NYC sort of group, right?

935
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:43,149
Speaker 0: He has a game called super gachapon fighter and I told him I would bring some gachapon's which I forgot to do.

936
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,652
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically this ring my house name Iku if you're a hero clicks kind of fan, you know You're right.

937
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:51,379
Speaker 0: forget that just get super gachapon fighter with this.

938
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:53,264
Speaker 0: lets you do is you get?

939
00:50:53,444 --> 00:51:01,490
Speaker 0: you know, your little PVC toy figures Right your little transformer guys, whatever it is, maybe whatever it is little street fighters little GI Joes.

940
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:09,063
Speaker 0: Maybe you know some anime characters whatever you got, you know You bring it to the table at a Red Bull is now my leading guy.

941
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:10,770
Speaker 0: can a Red Bull sure go for it?

942
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,854
Speaker 0: Right you both.

943
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:15,829
Speaker 0: you can roll up a character for whatever thing it is, you know, it's a point.

944
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:16,150
Speaker 0: systems.

945
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:26,510
Speaker 0: You don't actually roll you just make the character to match whatever the PVC is or the right and you play and it plays Sort of like hero clicks and it's actually a pretty good game.

946
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,689
Speaker 1: Like the fixes a lot of the crap that hero clicks has kind of wrong with it the the math of the.

947
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:39,112
Speaker 0: I mean It's still a miniatures combat game It's still dice and randomness and all that stuff that the dice actually works similarly to burning wheel with the successes and the failures and that.

948
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:46,755
Speaker 0: but the the the metaphor of the dice actually matches a fighting game like you do flurries and Combos and you do.

949
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:50,647
Speaker 1: you have special moves and yeah, like getting in close or being far away.

950
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:57,750
Speaker 1: You got projectiles Hadouken, he's got a mechanic with movement and projectiles where you like lay out these strips and that shows the distance.

951
00:51:57,851 --> 00:52:01,449
Speaker 0: So it's like the old war games where it doesn't have to be super precise either, you know.

952
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:02,455
Speaker 0: So it's.

953
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:04,265
Speaker 0: it's a pretty high quality game.

954
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:05,010
Speaker 0: It's super fun.

955
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:08,690
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy it and you know get the whole thing going on in, you know.

956
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,602
Speaker 0: Now there's no reason to throw away all your old toys and it works.

957
00:52:11,883 --> 00:52:13,490
Speaker 0: He played with like a big old Unicron.

958
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,235
Speaker 0: He played with tiny stuff big stuff.

959
00:52:15,275 --> 00:52:15,816
Speaker 0: It's all good.

960
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:16,478
Speaker 0: It all works.

961
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:26,993
Speaker 1: So Live-streaming thing we tried to do where we played some jungle speed and if any of you watch that you might recall that we thought We were so smart.

962
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:28,359
Speaker 1: We're like this game is broken.

963
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,890
Speaker 1: Scott took his turn, you know, it's the game where you flip up cars.

964
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,381
Speaker 1: So with your same as I flip a card like this.

965
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,450
Speaker 1: Scott flips a card like flip flip flip flip.

966
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:43,470
Speaker 1: And if the cards match in certain ways Then whoever grabs the jungle speed totem first like wins that round and the other player gets punished has to pick up all the cards.

967
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:44,615
Speaker 1: They're not out of cards you win.

968
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:47,087
Speaker 1: So I'm like, alright, this game's just broken.

969
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:50,779
Speaker 1: Scott take your turn I just put my fingers around the totem.

970
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:51,822
Speaker 1: I'm like go for it.

971
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:56,481
Speaker 1: Yeah Scott, you know flip his card I go up Or I go.

972
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,775
Speaker 1: All right Let's go continue.

973
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:00,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we go to this guy.

974
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:01,930
Speaker 0: He's demoing jungle speed.

975
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,970
Speaker 0: So I'm like, all right, we gotta ask this guy if this game is broken or not right away.

976
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:07,605
Speaker 1: He's like European clearly.

977
00:53:07,746 --> 00:53:08,110
Speaker 1: He's smart.

978
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,271
Speaker 2: I you know I was.

979
00:53:09,372 --> 00:53:14,630
Speaker 0: you know whenever I do this I expect that I'm gonna prove to this person that their game is broken.

980
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,450
Speaker 0: But I hope that they will prove to me that I'm wrong and the game is awesome.

981
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:21,850
Speaker 0: This is a case of them proving to me that the game is actually awesome.

982
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy doesn't even Scott's like.

983
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:24,263
Speaker 1: so here's what the guy's like.

984
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:25,368
Speaker 1: All right, just show me what you do.

985
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:26,756
Speaker 1: Show me what you do.

986
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:29,030
Speaker 0: So I'm like, okay, I flip a card and when it's your turn.

987
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,288
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put my hand around the totem like this and the guy just says just like that.

988
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,729
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess you knocked it over.

989
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:42,830
Speaker 0: And if you the rule is if you knock if you're the last person to touch the totem and it gets knocked over Then you have to pick up all the cards in the table.

990
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:45,170
Speaker 1: I realized the rules don't say don't hit the other player.

991
00:53:45,371 --> 00:53:46,760
Speaker 1: All it says is the totem.

992
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,350
Speaker 1: whoever knocks the totem over loses.

993
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:50,841
Speaker 0: So the guy just whacked my hand and the totem went flying.

994
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:51,905
Speaker 0: and he's like take all the cards.

995
00:53:51,986 --> 00:53:55,457
Speaker 0: and I'm like, oh, thank you so much You have fixed jungle speed.

996
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:57,125
Speaker 1: They were like, what are we grabbed at the same time?

997
00:53:57,205 --> 00:53:58,170
Speaker 1: He's like most fingers.

998
00:53:58,573 --> 00:54:00,750
Speaker 1: What is the same number of fingers closest to the bottom?

999
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,224
Speaker 1: What if you know, we're on top of each other inside wins like.

1000
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:05,510
Speaker 1: it's all these obvious.

1001
00:54:05,711 --> 00:54:06,875
Speaker 1: He should make a little radish II.

1002
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:07,457
Speaker 0: they should.

1003
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:10,670
Speaker 0: I'm gonna write new rules for jungle speed that fix the game.

1004
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:12,729
Speaker 1: So we're gonna play that game again.

1005
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,222
Speaker 1: They're gonna play some jungle speed cuz I can still do the strategy of the blocking.

1006
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:24,590
Speaker 0: apparently the way they play is they'll usually Hold the deck in one hand You know their deck in one hand and play with the other hand to guarantee that they're only using one hand.

1007
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,930
Speaker 0: Yep, and any edge of the table put their hand when it's not your turn.

1008
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:32,750
Speaker 0: They'll put their hands on the edge of the table and then go ha for the totem like that man.

1009
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,981
Speaker 1: They're so faking out this kind of game like spoons back there.

1010
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,630
Speaker 1: I would be like, huh and not grab it.

1011
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd be like, I feel like I should make the Colossus noise every time.

1012
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the guy fixed jungle speed for us, yeah, I was so happy about that.

1013
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:50,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that pretty much covers what we did in tabletop.

1014
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,008
Speaker 0: I wish I wish we would.

1015
00:54:52,028 --> 00:54:54,160
Speaker 0: yeah, Luke crane ran his burning wheel demos.

1016
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:55,751
Speaker 0: A lot of people played there were pretty much.

1017
00:54:55,832 --> 00:54:56,658
Speaker 1: it was so crowded.

1018
00:54:56,698 --> 00:55:01,119
Speaker 1: one point He was trying to get hold of our friend Alex who does burning wheel demos wherever he can because he loves doing that.

1019
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:09,217
Speaker 1: To get him because so many people wanted burning wheel demos, especially after our panel when basically he was like Yeah, all the books sold out like right away after our panel.

1020
00:55:09,378 --> 00:55:10,625
Speaker 0: Yeah It was weird.

1021
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:11,852
Speaker 0: the complete strategist came.

1022
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:14,347
Speaker 0: it seems like they didn't stay on Sunday Which is really weird.

1023
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:15,840
Speaker 1: I sold out of everything that was selling.

1024
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:24,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was really I don't know but you know, they it seemed like they were in what they brought, you know They brought this giant stack of tickets to ride and zero dominions.

1025
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,835
Speaker 0: It's like if maybe they didn't have dominions understandable or maybe that was excess stock.

1026
00:55:28,856 --> 00:55:29,578
Speaker 1: They said to get rid of.

1027
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:35,260
Speaker 0: yeah It's like dude, if you wanted to make mad bank, you should have brought a giant stack of Dominion as tall as your ticket to ride.

1028
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:38,299
Speaker 1: No Thunderstone is not the greatest game.

1029
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,204
Speaker 0: It would have sold.

1030
00:55:39,364 --> 00:55:45,233
Speaker 1: not enough people have played it yet if you would add thunderstone out with a demo and you're like This is Dominion plus dungeon crawling.

1031
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:46,260
Speaker 1: They were sold every freaking cop.

1032
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they sold like they sold out of action castle.

1033
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:50,560
Speaker 0: They sold out of burning wheel.

1034
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:52,370
Speaker 0: They had you know, and they didn't bring that many.

1035
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,140
Speaker 0: They only brought like with 30 copies or so.

1036
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:55,840
Speaker 0: So yeah, I saw the whole stack.

1037
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:59,660
Speaker 1: I feel like I have a terrible power because so many people came up to me later in the con.

1038
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,953
Speaker 1: They're like I tried to buy like any other every game we talked about.

1039
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:05,417
Speaker 1: they're like and I couldn't find it for sale or it sold out.

1040
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,314
Speaker 1: Sorry, even the games like dogs in the vineyard that we didn't even talk about.

1041
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:11,700
Speaker 1: It's just it's in the panel description.

1042
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:13,490
Speaker 0: I was actually, you know sort of impressed.

1043
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,320
Speaker 0: a lot of people come up to us during the con.

1044
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,760
Speaker 0: They're like we want you to play X. We want you to come do this with us, you know.

1045
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:24,420
Speaker 0: And I'm like, you know I have a hard time saying no and usually it doesn't happen just because it's hard to meet up with people.

1046
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, and too many of you were it didn't happen.

1047
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,191
Speaker 0: Like I really wanted to play.

1048
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:28,453
Speaker 0: right.

1049
00:56:28,473 --> 00:56:29,400
Speaker 1: so the vineyard with you.

1050
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:37,480
Speaker 0: The thing is at PAX East everyone who wanted to do something with us except for the one dude who wanted to play dogs In the vineyard and the other people who wanted us to play their game.

1051
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,248
Speaker 1: Oh, we didn't go back to the.

1052
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:45,388
Speaker 1: that education will make your game game either Where you make the game and then you play the game.

1053
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:46,492
Speaker 0: All right forget.

1054
00:56:46,512 --> 00:56:47,616
Speaker 1: So that's nothing we fucked up.

1055
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:53,153
Speaker 0: Yeah Other than that, right we did everything that we said we would do.

1056
00:56:53,193 --> 00:56:53,434
Speaker 0: so it was.

1057
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:54,980
Speaker 0: actually we got a lot done.

1058
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:57,211
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I really wanted to play dogs in the vineyard.

1059
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,980
Speaker 1: that guy he was the kind of guy to run it.

1060
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,526
Speaker 1: He was the kind of guy like had his deal.

1061
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:04,000
Speaker 1: Yes, like when uncle yo runs the inspectors like he knows exactly what he's doing.

1062
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,643
Speaker 0: Let's talk about.

1063
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,129
Speaker 0: the education will make the game game.

1064
00:57:06,149 --> 00:57:06,992
Speaker 0: All right.

1065
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the concept here who was that?

1066
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,341
Speaker 0: You did it.

1067
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:12,394
Speaker 0: It was some guy that we met like once in the past.

1068
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,158
Speaker 0: I forget his name.

1069
00:57:13,178 --> 00:57:15,736
Speaker 1: Sorry, dude Yeah, but we'll do a show on this like geek night.

1070
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:16,180
Speaker 1: So don't worry.

1071
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:21,440
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna talk about this a lot But the concept is that you make a game aimed at younger kids where it's a flash game.

1072
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,409
Speaker 1: The game is your plate.

1073
00:57:23,429 --> 00:57:25,880
Speaker 1: you have a game that is broken like and every game is different.

1074
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,845
Speaker 1: Like what's the platformer?

1075
00:57:26,865 --> 00:57:27,508
Speaker 1: What's the tile game?

1076
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:27,890
Speaker 1: Whatever.

1077
00:57:28,452 --> 00:57:30,080
Speaker 1: and you fix the game?

1078
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,260
Speaker 0: The game is yeah, basically you're playing a game and while you're playing the game you have play mode and edit modes.

1079
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,699
Speaker 0: You like a level will be broken.

1080
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,841
Speaker 0: You'll have to go to edit mode and fix the broken level then go to play mode and get to the end of the low One.

1081
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:46,920
Speaker 1: that's a concept that you could take in a lot of directions, but they're taking it in this like educational kid direction.

1082
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:48,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

1083
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:49,087
Speaker 0: it was pretty awesome.

1084
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,915
Speaker 0: So I highly recommend it.

1085
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:52,544
Speaker 0: if I can remember the name of it I would tell it.

1086
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:53,912
Speaker 1: we'll do a whole show about it.

1087
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:54,999
Speaker 0: We'll put a link up and all that.

1088
00:57:55,802 --> 00:58:00,556
Speaker 1: So we did three panels at PAX East the exact same three we did at PAX West.

1089
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:01,880
Speaker 0: they you know.

1090
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,623
Speaker 0: It was surprising.

1091
00:58:02,643 --> 00:58:06,220
Speaker 0: we did beyond D&D first and I actually felt like it wasn't our best beyond.

1092
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:10,117
Speaker 1: I was just like I was really wrecked and we forgot some stuff.

1093
00:58:10,137 --> 00:58:10,800
Speaker 1: We backpedaled.

1094
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:13,772
Speaker 1: We didn't do our usual disclaimer about how much we actually loved D&D.

1095
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:15,038
Speaker 1: Yeah halfway through.

1096
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,164
Speaker 0: Yeah It wasn't.

1097
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:17,454
Speaker 0: I wasn't like what.

1098
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:24,429
Speaker 0: while I was up there I was like, this is not our best beyond D&D, but you know what people loved it Crane told me afterwards.

1099
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:25,174
Speaker 0: I was like hilarious.

1100
00:58:25,194 --> 00:58:25,858
Speaker 0: I was like, what are you talking?

1101
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:26,160
Speaker 0: the whole?

1102
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,923
Speaker 1: Entire convention.

1103
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,995
Speaker 1: people kept coming up to me like so beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

1104
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:31,337
Speaker 1: They like.

1105
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:32,160
Speaker 1: question that a comment.

1106
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,186
Speaker 1: Everyone said it was great.

1107
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:38,329
Speaker 1: I don't want to chew my own horn, but I Feel you liked even a crappy rendition of.

1108
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,453
Speaker 0: you know, it's like we.

1109
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,220
Speaker 0: it's like if you have a song it's a good song.

1110
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,446
Speaker 0: It's a song people like.

1111
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:44,940
Speaker 0: that's a hit but you did a poor singing job.

1112
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,500
Speaker 0: You got some notes wrong and I guess people still thought it's very hard of it.

1113
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,106
Speaker 1: Is that one?

1114
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,399
Speaker 1: even if we do a bad job?

1115
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,070
Speaker 1: Even if we did a terrible job the content matters.

1116
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:53,552
Speaker 1: There's a reason.

1117
00:58:53,592 --> 00:58:55,800
Speaker 1: we've been doing this panel what this is our third packs.

1118
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,506
Speaker 1: We've done it at yeah, like we did.

1119
00:58:57,526 --> 00:58:58,831
Speaker 0: we gotta retire this shit.

1120
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:00,055
Speaker 1: We did it at Otacon.

1121
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:01,340
Speaker 1: We might do it at magfest.

1122
00:59:01,783 --> 00:59:03,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see a magfest.

1123
00:59:03,074 --> 00:59:03,880
Speaker 0: I would do it again someday.

1124
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:07,180
Speaker 1: I want to record like a definitive version and be done with it right after that.

1125
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,010
Speaker 0: We did losing should be fun, which I think we didn't.

1126
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,775
Speaker 0: even worse job.

1127
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:10,660
Speaker 1: I think you did a better job.

1128
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,243
Speaker 1: I think it was really.

1129
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:12,631
Speaker 0: think so cuz I was falling.

1130
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:14,240
Speaker 0: It's literally falling asleep.

1131
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,467
Speaker 1: But I was like, uh, see beyond D&D is like a to a both of us panel Like we both wrote it straight up.

1132
00:59:19,508 --> 00:59:20,874
Speaker 1: We both perform it with equal parts.

1133
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:25,632
Speaker 1: losing should be fun Like I wrote and I Drive and Scott provides commentary and insight.

1134
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:29,748
Speaker 1: and beyond Candyland Scott Drive Scott wrote I just provide insight and commentary.

1135
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,374
Speaker 1: So I driving.

1136
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:34,379
Speaker 1: I think losing should be fun cuz I had some coffee So I had a second wind for that one.

1137
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:38,720
Speaker 1: So I think I pulled it all the way off and yeah, you were kind of falling asleep toward the end.

1138
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:42,003
Speaker 0: I was literally like yeah Like I'm like.

1139
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:45,130
Speaker 0: that's so bad if you're on doing a panel and you're just like meh.

1140
00:59:45,992 --> 00:59:50,807
Speaker 1: But at the same time again the contents of what matters because Everyone's had those experience like beyond D&D.

1141
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:57,503
Speaker 1: I mean look no one in that room except for that core of like fanboys who come to all our panels and already know us Even though it's the same panel.

1142
00:59:57,543 --> 01:00:00,879
Speaker 1: every time everyone else didn't know we were gonna say and they're all D&D people.

1143
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:10,959
Speaker 1: and the moment I live for and beyond D&D is when We say like D&D combat takes for fucking ever and you see people whenever I see people nodding Yeah, that's what I know.

1144
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,806
Speaker 0: It's going well.

1145
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:16,377
Speaker 1: and like the moment I said what if you just abstracted currency and you didn't count?

1146
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:22,610
Speaker 1: because it doesn't matter you want to skip to the fun part and there's one guy up in the front who went And he went to his friend.

1147
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,781
Speaker 1: he's like what another.

1148
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:32,690
Speaker 1: and I think it resonates because there are a lot of people who want these better role-playing Experiences and D&D is good for what it is, but it isn't good at that.

1149
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:38,390
Speaker 1: So I think that's why the panel is so good because even if we keep doing if you do it at every packs forever.

1150
01:00:38,954 --> 01:00:41,310
Speaker 1: Most of the people in the room have not seen it and don't know.

1151
01:00:41,832 --> 01:00:43,922
Speaker 1: That's why we got to make a video and get the word out there.

1152
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:47,597
Speaker 1: I don't want to take up tax time anymore Yeah, I just want everyone to know this stuff.

1153
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,164
Speaker 0: Yeah losing should be fun.

1154
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:51,515
Speaker 0: We talked about dwarf fortress Yeah, and such.

1155
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:52,721
Speaker 0: it was about losing.

1156
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:53,586
Speaker 0: It was a panel.

1157
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:53,928
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1158
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:59,870
Speaker 1: All right I think the plan with that panel is we'll probably run it at some other packs or something at some point.

1159
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:07,420
Speaker 1: But I think I'm gonna break it up because we basically touched on like single-player losing Multiplayer losing and narrative branching losing.

1160
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:09,426
Speaker 1: those could each be a panel.

1161
01:01:09,747 --> 01:01:10,530
Speaker 1: that losing should be fun.

1162
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:15,630
Speaker 1: It's kind of the overarching like think about the idea that losing should be fun that your game should always be fun.

1163
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,502
Speaker 1: If there's any point your games not fun games fucking broken.

1164
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:21,799
Speaker 0: Yep beyond candy line I think we actually did really well.

1165
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,730
Speaker 0: It was the room was not a hundred percent full.

1166
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,003
Speaker 0: It was like 90 percent full, you know, we did.

1167
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:27,130
Speaker 0: we ran the panel really?

1168
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:30,370
Speaker 0: Well, the only thing was that we were sort of pressed for time, you know.

1169
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:33,578
Speaker 0: So I sort of rushed the end a little bit But the rest of the panel was.

1170
01:01:33,618 --> 01:01:35,690
Speaker 0: it was a you know, it's usual awesome panel.

1171
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,302
Speaker 1: We'll try to get these up online in whatever forms we can.

1172
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:38,844

01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:45,630
Speaker 0: there's a someone up in New Hampshire who's doing a board game documentary someone awesome, by the way.

1176
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:50,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, we went and interviewed with them on after packs was over on Tuesday on our way to fun spot.

1177
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:53,750
Speaker 0: But they recorded and filmed the beyond candy land panel.

1178
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,138
Speaker 0: So that's gonna be on the the Internet's.

01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,090
Speaker 0: hopefully ish soon and also maybe even in a documentary or who knows what?

1180
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:05,470
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to get her other stuff online even the bad running of beyond D&D because a bad one is better than nothing.

1181
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:06,795
Speaker 0: Yep, people want to see it.

1182
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:08,581
Speaker 0: Yep and action castle.

1183
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:14,000
Speaker 0: Of course, we did action castle and also jungle adventure And it was the typical awesome.

1184
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,809
Speaker 1: They died Jared like he had a sore throat Like he was kind of sick trying to run this but he did it.

1185
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:23,297
Speaker 0: Anyway, they had a rough time dealing with the with the ogre Troll the troll.

1186
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:24,385
Speaker 0: they couldn't get past the troll.

1187
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:25,070
Speaker 0: they kept dying.

1188
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,101
Speaker 0: It was not a good sight to see.

1189
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,950
Speaker 1: it was funny because you know We did the action castle like thing in the main events.

1190
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:34,806
Speaker 1: So, of course action castle sold out and everyone kept hearing us talk about it.

1191
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:35,770
Speaker 1: people already knew about it.

1192
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:39,890
Speaker 1: So I think a lot of people like memorized it or came into this like knowing what to expect.

1193
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:41,658
Speaker 1: So they won pretty hand.

1194
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:42,742
Speaker 0: There were a lot of people cheating.

1195
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:44,530
Speaker 0: They had pieces of paper and they were writing.

1196
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:47,589
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think that's awesome.

1197
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,436
Speaker 1: But jungle adventure happened.

1198
01:02:49,456 --> 01:02:53,129
Speaker 1: you I know people like came into this thinking they'd be awesome and like know what to do.

1199
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:56,743
Speaker 1: Like someone came in they're like save game because they knew.

1200
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:59,254
Speaker 1: but then jungle adventure suddenly Oh shit, like.

1201
01:02:59,616 --> 01:03:02,210
Speaker 0: I never played jungle adventure before so I had no clue what to do.

1202
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:05,101
Speaker 0: Luke crane actually told me some secrets of jungle adventure.

1203
01:03:05,121 --> 01:03:05,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like jungle.

1204
01:03:06,005 --> 01:03:07,230
Speaker 1: I like the fire ants thing a lot.

1205
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, the fire thing was good.

1206
01:03:08,755 --> 01:03:09,719
Speaker 0: You get the fire ants on you.

1207
01:03:09,739 --> 01:03:12,790
Speaker 0: You're gonna die in three turns, but it was weird.

1208
01:03:12,894 --> 01:03:17,446
Speaker 1: You know We always thought that PAX is like where it's hard to be a celebrity like it's.

1209
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,900
Speaker 1: it's harder to break into It's real deal like the panels of serious business.

1210
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:24,689
Speaker 1: Everything's real and anime cons You know like we do these million panels.

1211
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:28,406
Speaker 1: But PAX is where like everyone kept coming up to us throughout the con like.

1212
01:03:28,486 --> 01:03:29,410

01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,922
Speaker 0: at PAX it East at least never really at the West.

1217
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:49,375
Speaker 0: it felt like when I was walking around the hallways Like every minute or two someone would come up to me or if I'd be in a line somewhere someone would say hey panels are Awesome, sweet

1218
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:55,663
Speaker 1: or like just constant college humor guys, you know We went to your panel and cuz we're interested in darkly like we do enough

1224
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,690
Speaker 1: I'm like, hey, you look like you're on your way to the college humor panel.

1228
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,403
Speaker 1: So we go in and after their panel, I go up to talk to him.

1229
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:26,730
Speaker 1: cuz I want to talk about darkly.

1230
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:28,110
Speaker 1: I want to I think darkly.

1231
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:32,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't know they're making a new site called darkly and basically, you know college humor.

1232
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:38,684
Speaker 0: There's a lot of nerdy videos like Tetris guy There's those Mortal Kombat parodies Street Fighter later years.

1233
01:04:38,704 --> 01:04:39,910
Speaker 0: They do a lot of gaming stuff.

1234
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:43,750
Speaker 0: But the thing is they avoid stuff that's too obscure for normal people to inside baseball.

1235
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:50,490
Speaker 0: But right, so they're making a new site darkly where they can do the stuff that would be too inside baseball for college humor.

1236
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,710
Speaker 1: What's cool though their point like and it kind of echoed actually will weed in this keynote.

1237
01:04:53,851 --> 01:04:59,669
Speaker 1: They were like look we think that if we just had video game references They're ubiquitous enough for people will get him.

1238
01:05:00,072 --> 01:05:03,330
Speaker 1: But we can't get away with that as much with just the college humor stuff with the demographic.

1239
01:05:03,732 --> 01:05:05,258
Speaker 1: Let's go all out and see what happens.

1240
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,624

1241
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:08,090
Speaker 0: I look forward to that site.

1242
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:09,210
Speaker 0: It'll be a frequent visitor.

1243
01:05:09,432 --> 01:05:11,410
Speaker 0: I hope it produces many fine things of the day.

1244
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,610
Speaker 1: But I went up to talk to him because you know, I didn't know about darkly.

1245
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,290
Speaker 1: So I was like, yeah, we got to talk about this.

1246
01:05:15,372 --> 01:05:15,868
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1247
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:25,185
Speaker 1: And while I was up there talking to them these people who came up to talk to them after their panel We're like, I think the guy who asked that question was Scott.

1248
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:26,490
Speaker 1: Oh that Scott.

1249
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy from geek nights did the action castle thing.

1250
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,330
Speaker 1: and then they then some other guy comes up to me.

1251
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,576
Speaker 1: He's like, oh my god rim.

1252
01:05:32,656 --> 01:05:36,132
Speaker 1: I was at your beyond D&D panel and then those guys like oh my god Is that rim?

1253
01:05:36,152 --> 01:05:43,088
Speaker 1: and like this weird clusterfuck and at all these people asking me questions in front of them Waiting for you last them questions.

1254
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:46,937
Speaker 0: I was outside while that was going on.

1255
01:05:46,957 --> 01:05:58,647
Speaker 1: Yeah So back to the present on Tuesday with us in New York and not in Boston too.

1256
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,617
Speaker 2: Well, I think you know, there's a yeah.

1257
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,084
Speaker 2: Anyway, my many Tuesdays do not be confused.

1258
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:06,010
Speaker 2: as of right now of this talking.

1259
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,555
Speaker 2: It is Tuesday, April 6.

1260
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:07,776
Speaker 1: Yes.

1261
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,123
Speaker 1: Pax is long gone anime Boston long gone.

1262
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:12,370
Speaker 2: But you know, what any of us is not long gone.

1263
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,290
Speaker 2: It's shortly gone.

1264
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:18,302
Speaker 2: Feels like forever ago, but packs West is less than six months.

1265
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:20,710
Speaker 1: I know and packs East is less than a year away.

1266
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:23,757
Speaker 2: I can't wait.

1267
01:06:23,778 --> 01:06:24,140
Speaker 2: I don't know.

1268
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:24,746
Speaker 2: We don't have packs.

1269
01:06:24,826 --> 01:06:25,827
Speaker 2: East dates You never know.

1270
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:26,351
Speaker 2: so

1271
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:41,730
Speaker 1: I think what we want to do the thing we didn't get to when we're recording this stuff in Boston is kind of The crazy moments of packs like all the kind of things that didn't really fit anywhere else Just the stuff that really stood out up to us and I don't know kind of in reverse order.

1272
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,109
Speaker 1: I want to start with the elbow bump.

1273
01:06:43,672 --> 01:06:47,666
Speaker 2: The elbow bump very important with this carried over to anime Boston for us as well and it were.

1274
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:56,075
Speaker 1: and it got to the point To where people who approached us came elbow ready because they remembered and every time someone like gave us the handshake I'd be like no elbow.

1275
01:06:56,557 --> 01:06:58,644
Speaker 1: and once they realize what was up there like oh crap.

1276
01:06:58,664 --> 01:06:59,346
Speaker 1: Yeah disease.

1277
01:06:59,407 --> 01:06:59,748
Speaker 1: Damn it.

1278
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,256
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean packs penny arcade.

1279
01:07:02,276 --> 01:07:08,130
Speaker 2: put up the comic telling you to use the iron guard position right instead of using You know the elbow.

1280
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:14,508
Speaker 1: I wonder how many people realize that the iron guard position is basically the I am invisible and larping position sort.

1281
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:14,629
Speaker 2: of.

1282
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:28,484
Speaker 2: the problem I have with the iron guard position right is that there is a. there is a psychological thing about like You know touching somebody right like they did a whole bunch of studies where it's like, okay They'll have someone go into a phone booth and leave a wallet behind, you know.

1283
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:33,289
Speaker 2: and on their way out of the phone booth They'll touch the person who's waiting to get into the phone booth.

1284
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:39,850
Speaker 2: And if they do that then the person will more often, you know call them and be like, hey your wallet.

1285
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:45,930
Speaker 2: But if you don't touch the person on your way out of the phone booth It is less likely that they will say hey your wallet, right?

1286
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:49,490
Speaker 1: So what happens if you pick up the phone booth, right so that you die?

1287
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,213
Speaker 2: But the point?

1288
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:54,530
Speaker 2: so the point of a handshake is you know, you you touch this person and there is something about that.

1289
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:58,330
Speaker 2: The iron guard position, you know eliminates all touching whatsoever.

1290
01:07:58,812 --> 01:08:01,504
Speaker 2: And the thing is you don't really need to eliminate all the touching.

1291
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:08,105
Speaker 2: you can do the elbow bump Which gives you the touching that has the same psychological impact as you know.

1292
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:17,069
Speaker 2: a handshake, you know Maybe not quite as much but you but you don't have to get me your your hands on their hands Do not contact and the hands are you know?

1293
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:22,575
Speaker 1: The the disease transfer positions and I think the way forward because you know This elbow bump.

1294
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:29,984
Speaker 1: iron guard thing kind of came out of the fact that there was an unrelated Norovirus outbreak at like colleges and everyone got swine flu at Pax West Yep.

1295
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:39,800
Speaker 1: So I think what we need to do is every time there's a con The con should just lie and say there's an outbreak of something like that and remind everyone to elbow bump And then the kids won't get sick.

1296
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,109
Speaker 2: You don't even need to do an elbow bump.

1297
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,443
Speaker 2: You should just be like yeah cons are you know, dens of horrible disease.

1298
01:08:44,464 --> 01:08:45,908
Speaker 2: Do not shake hands with anyone.

1299
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,790
Speaker 1: It amazes me that everyone just bump elbows.

1300
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:50,219
Speaker 1: New York fucking city does not make me sick.

1301
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,189
Speaker 1: touching like grimy subways and then sticking my finger in my eye.

1302
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:57,032
Speaker 2: Cuz you wash your fucking hands even though I don't that often and you know You could.

1303
01:08:57,073 --> 01:08:59,127
Speaker 2: you know, it's actually really easy to get in New York City.

1304
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:01,666
Speaker 2: pink I feel like if you're on the subway and you rub your eyes.

1305
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:02,430
Speaker 2: pink eye Ho.

1306
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:05,725
Speaker 1: I think I is one of the things I fear almost more than death.

1307
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:06,810
Speaker 1: I hate pink eyes so much.

1308
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:07,495
Speaker 2: What's to fear?

1309
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:09,170
Speaker 2: your eye just goes in for a little while?

1310
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:09,551
Speaker 1: I hate that.

1311
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,082
Speaker 1: anything where that makes my eyes itch just drives me crazy.

1312
01:09:12,162 --> 01:09:24,276
Speaker 2: I can't deal with it's not so bad I mean if you get a lot worse things than pink eye like I don't know Norovirus where you're basically puking and diarrhea and like crazy, but at least that ends quickly A couple days.

1313
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:27,224
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll tell you what I'll take ten pink guys over one norovirus.

1314
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:31,974
Speaker 1: I don't know where they consecutive or concurrent Both ten times.

1315
01:09:32,054 --> 01:09:35,002
Speaker 2: It'll be ten squared guys in both eyes at the same time.

1316
01:09:35,063 --> 01:09:36,227
Speaker 1: number nine.

1317
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:37,350
Speaker 1: There's no actual list.

1318
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,495
Speaker 1: I'm just kind of going up from things.

1319
01:09:38,555 --> 01:09:39,620
Speaker 1: I jotted a notepad.

1320
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in case we didn't talk about it the omegathon whatever.

1321
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:51,152
Speaker 1: the omegathon finale was The most epic or at least I think equal to the excite bike epicness It was.

1322
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:53,203
Speaker 2: it was a good omegathon finale right.

1323
01:09:53,224 --> 01:09:54,250
Speaker 2: there was a. it was good.

1324
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,893
Speaker 2: There was no way I could have predicted it right, but once I saw it It was obvious.

1325
01:09:58,314 --> 01:10:01,285
Speaker 2: the thing is right for the second omegathon in a row.

1326
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:07,190
Speaker 1: there are technological difficulties Yeah But at the same time the fact that there were so few I expected disaster.

1327
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:10,530
Speaker 1: When I saw what they were trying to do all I thought was there's no way this is gonna.

1328
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:12,560
Speaker 2: You know they did do test runs of it.

1329
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,570
Speaker 2: You know I mean, I don't think we could have done any better.

1330
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:19,730
Speaker 2: I think the thing is that they mess up right and that they insist on using the actual technology.

1331
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:20,534
Speaker 1: They should lie.

1332
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:22,182
Speaker 1: they should just have the NES there.

1333
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:23,990
Speaker 1: make everything look like it's in an NES.

1334
01:10:24,371 --> 01:10:29,330
Speaker 1: But behind that NES is a NES controller to USB converter and a frickin emulator.

1335
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,394
Speaker 2: It's just yeah, they should use.

1336
01:10:30,414 --> 01:10:32,201
Speaker 2: they have all those Dell PC's right.

1337
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,389
Speaker 2: you can grab like ten of them and use them.

1338
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:38,246
Speaker 1: You know I'm sure there are concerns about legality, and they're big and they don't want to worry.

1339
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:40,395
Speaker 1: Just fake it Just totally fake it.

1340
01:10:40,495 --> 01:10:41,379
Speaker 1: no one would know.

1341
01:10:41,499 --> 01:10:55,115
Speaker 2: look just if you worry about the legality right I don't think anyone is gonna challenge you right on You know if you emulate an NES game and right there you have an NES and the game and the controller is just sitting there You know and may have.

1342
01:10:55,155 --> 01:10:55,396
Speaker 2: you know.

1343
01:10:55,436 --> 01:10:56,721
Speaker 2: if you need to you have to.

1344
01:10:56,761 --> 01:11:03,025
Speaker 2: if you need ten you have ten and just use the Emulator right in front of it, but like I said nobody is gonna complain if you fake it.

1345
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,228
Speaker 1: you're double protected That's true.

1346
01:11:05,963 --> 01:11:12,550
Speaker 2: But anyway You know and you can use the actual controllers the USB connection and it doesn't need to be authentic if it Roo if it ruins.

1347
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:17,764
Speaker 2: The suspense then you know and the awesomeness of the omega-thon with a technological difficulty.

1348
01:11:18,165 --> 01:11:20,170
Speaker 2: don't use the old busted technology.

1349
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:27,438
Speaker 1: But luckily at least with this omega-thon like he got all the way through and then there was kind of the choke near the end But before kind of the ultimate round of it.

1350
01:11:28,061 --> 01:11:30,230
Speaker 1: so we basically got to experience the omega-thon twice.

1351
01:11:30,512 --> 01:11:36,850
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought you know I on the one hand I thought that you know on the second go-through after all had been revealed the suspense would lessen.

1352
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:40,435
Speaker 2: But after they started playing the suspense It came right back in.

1353
01:11:40,455 --> 01:11:42,683
Speaker 1: so I have two points about the omega-thon finale.

1354
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:44,710
Speaker 1: one team left got robbed.

1355
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:48,907
Speaker 1: Team left did indeed get robbed because team right did not know how to play Mario.

1356
01:11:49,008 --> 01:11:51,158
Speaker 2: one right I did not know how to play for crap.

1357
01:11:51,198 --> 01:12:00,818
Speaker 2: team right the right team on the right sucked ass Right, but then because they got to do a second go around because of the technological difficulties They knew where the coins were right.

1358
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,009
Speaker 2: the team on the right was able to come back.

1359
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:07,110
Speaker 1: The thing is the key team on the left despite you know in the second round they screwed up.

1360
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:10,730
Speaker 1: They had a couple of chokes and Tetris and such, but when they got to the contra round.

1361
01:12:11,113 --> 01:12:13,429
Speaker 1: They were catching up so fast they almost won in any way.

1362
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:14,473
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's you know.

1363
01:12:14,493 --> 01:12:16,600
Speaker 2: the team on the left was clear the superior team.

1364
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:21,338
Speaker 2: the thing is you know it says clearly in the omega-thon Rules they they decide who wins.

1365
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,487
Speaker 2: there is no appeals process, which is fine.

1366
01:12:23,507 --> 01:12:32,253
Speaker 1: the only problem I had like I feel bad for him But one of the guys on that team looked kind of genuinely pissed as opposed to good-naturedly pissed Mmm.

1367
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:34,523
Speaker 1: I felt kind of bad for him, but at the same time.

1368
01:12:34,885 --> 01:12:35,367
Speaker 1: What are you gonna?

1369
01:12:35,387 --> 01:12:36,070
Speaker 1: Do it's entertainment?

1370
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,315
Speaker 1: I mean yeah.

1371
01:12:37,656 --> 01:12:41,230
Speaker 1: the other point is that neither one of those teams could play any of those games for shit.

1372
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:42,418
Speaker 1: And I don't know.

1373
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:44,190
Speaker 2: the team on the left was okay at Contra.

1374
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:44,656
Speaker 1: They were good.

1375
01:12:44,677 --> 01:12:50,645
Speaker 2: they were pretty good at Contra But they couldn't play Mario 1 or Tetris and rad racer is such an easy game.

1376
01:12:50,685 --> 01:12:51,769
Speaker 2: everyone played it just fine.

1377
01:12:51,829 --> 01:12:54,780
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know that Tetris part really got to me.

1378
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:59,240
Speaker 2: just and the whole audience - that was another thing I you know they want to talk about like you know.

1379
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:02,476
Speaker 2: oh it has to be the real system Otherwise it doesn't count.

1380
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:07,139
Speaker 2: right we have to use the real control in Tetris right But they gave the two teams different Tetris's.

1381
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:09,930
Speaker 2: they didn't work both playing the same version of Tetris.

1382
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:18,870
Speaker 2: So if you're worried about a fair competition using actual NES's or whatever Then how could you also not be concerned with using two different Tetris versions?

1383
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:21,383
Speaker 1: That's yes the problem they ran into.

1384
01:13:21,403 --> 01:13:22,530
Speaker 2: that's hypocritical right there.

1385
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:26,163
Speaker 2: So you know no excuse not to use the emulators that will work perfectly every time.

1386
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:27,669
Speaker 1: with the the whole Konami code thing.

1387
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:29,120
Speaker 1: you know The problem they had with Contra.

1388
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:33,410
Speaker 1: they made him have to start over Props to coup for being there to put it in on the spot.

1389
01:13:33,772 --> 01:13:36,145
Speaker 1: Imagine if he had screwed that up, and they had to do it a third time.

1390
01:13:36,165 --> 01:13:37,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had it He did it.

1391
01:13:38,031 --> 01:13:42,918
Speaker 1: But I think it would have been better if they didn't enter the code And they just gave you Contra.

1392
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,910
Speaker 1: and if you didn't know the code and you got game.

1393
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:49,710
Speaker 2: Oh, if you could enter the code or if you got game over you could you know just keep restarting.

1394
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,706
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you got it.

1395
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:52,496
Speaker 1: I mean imagine that.

1396
01:13:52,556 --> 01:14:01,810
Speaker 1: imagine if you know one team just like goes for it and starts to die and the other team just Konami codes it and then the audience realizes the Konami code But then the other team wins anyway because they're just that good a cop.

1397
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,853
Speaker 2: I think the only read.

1398
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:15,309
Speaker 2: the argument against that though is that you know in trials right because they tried it out and The the time between the winner and the loser was one second, so they were like oh, this is perfect It's gonna be so down to the wire and awesome Yeah.

1399
01:14:15,471 --> 01:14:19,970
Speaker 2: But if you if one team knew the Konami code the other didn't it would be a no contest.

1400
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:30,390
Speaker 1: He'd be like ah but at the same time see this is the trouble because you are correct for the entertainment of the crowd That was the best option, but does someone who doesn't know the Konami code deserve to win the omega-thon?

1401
01:14:30,992 --> 01:14:32,297
Speaker 2: Well does someone who doesn't?

1402
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:35,930
Speaker 2: it was trying to go down every single pipe and Mario one deserved to win the omega-thon.

1403
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:36,853
Speaker 2: No But they did so.

1404
01:14:37,939 --> 01:14:44,464
Speaker 1: if he'd been small we might not have noticed But the fact that there's that big-ass Mario just ducking on all the clearly non duckable pipes.

1405
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:47,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was just sad that guy He'd be.

1406
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:57,718
Speaker 2: you know We I think we need to recreate this this challenge minus the contra part You know because that part was uninteresting and You know just see what how we can do.

1407
01:14:57,738 --> 01:15:00,007
Speaker 2: I think I think I could beat you in a Mario 150 coin.

1408
01:15:04,651 --> 01:15:05,368
Speaker 1: Doubt that?

1409
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:07,720
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll set it up.

1410
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:12,304
Speaker 1: We have to have some sort of live Rimmens got dual uh-huh anyway.

1411
01:15:12,364 --> 01:15:12,686
Speaker 1: We'll see.

1412
01:15:13,128 --> 01:15:13,630
Speaker 1: so briefly.

1413
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,830
Speaker 1: I don't want to dwell on these but our panels went freaking awesome and everyone in the crowd was badass.

1414
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:20,469
Speaker 1: I got to say one thing this this actually surprised me.

1415
01:15:21,052 --> 01:15:28,010
Speaker 1: We had a little bit of extra time just because the way the staggering was in the panels And we took some questions something we never really do it packs.

1416
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,542
Speaker 1: The questions people asked were great like they were good questions.

1417
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,027
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean some of them were awesome.

1418
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:36,876
Speaker 2: some of them were okay You know but there were no questions.

1419
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:38,362
Speaker 2: where I was like shut up fanboy.

1420
01:15:38,442 --> 01:15:40,690
Speaker 2: every question was a quality question.

1421
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:42,638
Speaker 2: You know I mean we got the.

1422
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:44,506
Speaker 2: of course you always get the occasional.

1423
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:45,410
Speaker 2: What about this game?

1424
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:46,857
Speaker 2: Have you played this specific thing?

1425
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:50,702
Speaker 2: and it's like no I haven't played that specific thing But you know those are.

1426
01:15:50,783 --> 01:15:51,590
Speaker 2: those are not so bad.

1427
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:52,554
Speaker 2: That's like the average.

1428
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,703
Speaker 2: that's a three star out of five star question.

1429
01:15:54,764 --> 01:15:55,969
Speaker 2: Have you played this specific thing?

1430
01:15:56,049 --> 01:15:56,150
Speaker 1: yep?

1431
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:02,518
Speaker 1: Though I will now take the opportunity to announce that at least as far as packs is concerned We are retiring beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

1432
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,106
Speaker 1: We've done it at three packs is we're not doing it there again.

1433
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,801
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I think as good as it is seriously.

1434
01:16:08,821 --> 01:16:10,468
Speaker 1: We're gonna film it at some point.

1435
01:16:10,488 --> 01:16:10,970
Speaker 1: We'll stick it up.

1436
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:14,886
Speaker 1: We'll probably end up doing it like magfest and things but no more packs.

1437
01:16:14,906 --> 01:16:15,810
Speaker 1: We got to bring fresh stuff.

1438
01:16:16,191 --> 01:16:19,586
Speaker 1: We might retire beyond Candyland and losing should be fun too.

1439
01:16:19,606 --> 01:16:20,590
Speaker 2: I don't want to retire beyond Candyland.

1440
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:22,270
Speaker 2: I think that has like another year left.

1441
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,396
Speaker 1: We'll see the.

1442
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:24,000
Speaker 1: the working title.

1443
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,830
Speaker 2: People still need to play more German games.

1444
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:26,976
Speaker 2: We can update it with some different games.

1445
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:36,075
Speaker 1: To tantalize two working titles I have for panels I'm slowly working on for future packs is our egregiously unrealized potential?

1446
01:16:36,095 --> 01:16:47,824
Speaker 1: yeah, which is basically the Nintendo panel right and Games make the player hmm Some sort of mechanism design, but we have to not tread on Luke.

1447
01:16:47,944 --> 01:16:49,990
Speaker 2: Luke cranes game is mind control panel.

1448
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,239
Speaker 1: I think they can both exist in the same ecosystem.

1449
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,563
Speaker 1: I'm not going to steal his hobbit example again Yeah, but we'll be using our DDR example.

1450
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,996
Speaker 2: Which is almost the same thing I think.

1451
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:08,552
Speaker 1: one more thing that is worth mentioning It was pretty damn awesome was Scott having the balls to do the action castle thing in the first Q&A Balls.

1452
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:09,235
Speaker 1: it was easy.

1453
01:17:09,415 --> 01:17:13,090
Speaker 1: I point out jerry did not have the testicular fortitude to do it himself.

1454
01:17:13,272 --> 01:17:14,565
Speaker 2: He just didn't want to you know.

1455
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:20,160
Speaker 2: I asked him I'm like you sure you don't want to do it you sure and he just didn't want to be all Self-promotional and whatever at the same time.

1456
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,949
Speaker 1: He was fine with you doing it.

1457
01:17:22,231 --> 01:17:23,498
Speaker 2: He was fine with me doing it.

1458
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,730
Speaker 2: apparently a lot of other people thought it was okay.

1459
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:30,110
Speaker 2: I you know I didn't think it was that great when I was doing it or what you know.

1460
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:36,398
Speaker 2: I thought it was oh, you know pretty clever, but it people were like oh, man I think part of it is that no one expected it.

1461
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:41,478
Speaker 1: and every year like there are a few people who do something clever at The QA and no one you think about it.

1462
01:17:41,498 --> 01:17:44,470
Speaker 1: in all these packs is no one thought to try to play a game with them.

1463
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:46,006
Speaker 1: Right there a short one mmm.

1464
01:17:46,551 --> 01:17:49,790
Speaker 1: And also you know I think the fact that you didn't milk it that you stopped it at the appropriate time.

1465
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:53,181
Speaker 2: Well, I was planning to you know I knew that I had to keep it short right.

1466
01:17:53,542 --> 01:18:00,030
Speaker 2: so I wanted to I wanted to you Know to cut it off at the appropriate time because if I stood there too long it'd be very bad.

1467
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,997
Speaker 2: It's a question-answer thing.

1468
01:18:02,037 --> 01:18:04,345
Speaker 1: the genius of taiko that at the perfect moment.

1469
01:18:04,365 --> 01:18:05,870
Speaker 1: He was like quit.

1470
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,757
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think it was his genius right.

1471
01:18:07,777 --> 01:18:08,279
Speaker 2: I think it was.

1472
01:18:08,299 --> 01:18:17,870
Speaker 2: you know I I knew that Mike would not do Well right in advance, but I didn't know he would do that poorly and I sort of messed up right in that.

1473
01:18:18,232 --> 01:18:22,700
Speaker 2: You know it wasn't his turn, but he kept thinking it was his turn And it's like oh what am I supposed to do?

1474
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:23,645
Speaker 1: you should have just either.

1475
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,756
Speaker 1: you could have kept saying I don't understand.

1476
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:27,021
Speaker 1: What the fuck do you want to me?

1477
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,769
Speaker 1: I don't come into your house and do this shit to you.

1478
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:33,089
Speaker 2: He didn't say that until after I told him it's not his turn.

1479
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:34,630
Speaker 2: You know Jared?

1480
01:18:34,771 --> 01:18:42,450
Speaker 2: I think you know it could have been a little bit better because afterwards I asked Jared what I should have done And he said you should have said something along the lines of you know player one.

1481
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:43,815
Speaker 2: It is not your turn.

1482
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:49,778
Speaker 2: You know as opposed to saying you know it's not your turn You can't say anything if it's not your turn.

1483
01:18:49,818 --> 01:18:50,420
Speaker 2: and like.

1484
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,977
Speaker 2: the other thing is that Jerry just was not helping me out like he Thought it wasn't his turn.

1485
01:18:53,998 --> 01:18:55,107
Speaker 2: He was just being all quiet.

1486
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:58,470
Speaker 1: because yeah I think he was I think he thought to say quit and he was just waiting for them.

1487
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:06,415
Speaker 2: No, no because if you if you actually look back at it You know Mike's like you know say whatever will make him stop, and then he says quit You know.

1488
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,643
Speaker 2: so that that's what see.

1489
01:19:07,663 --> 01:19:08,630
Speaker 1: the thing is with the showmanship.

1490
01:19:08,872 --> 01:19:15,170
Speaker 1: I wonder how much of that was like the Unstated nod between the two of them that that interchange would have been a good joke and then they pulled it off.

1491
01:19:15,392 --> 01:19:21,042
Speaker 1: I have no there's no way to know what those guys I got to admit those guys are getting pretty damn good at entertaining a crowd.

1492
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,066
Speaker 2: it is it is in.

1493
01:19:22,226 --> 01:19:24,718
Speaker 2: it is difficult if nay Impossible to know.

1494
01:19:24,738 --> 01:19:26,590
Speaker 2: so it doesn't really matter either.

1495
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:30,909
Speaker 2: It's just a silly action castle question whatever, but people liked it.

1496
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:33,598
Speaker 2: It made people excited for action castle.

1497
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:34,661
Speaker 2: action castle sold out.

1498
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:36,186
Speaker 2: it totally worked, so now.

1499
01:19:36,246 --> 01:19:44,109
Speaker 2: I just have to think of Ways to promote whatever else I'm trying to sell at a Q&A without being blatantly self-promotional like you know.

1500
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:47,350
Speaker 2: Hey, everybody come over to my booth and buy my shit.

1501
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:55,001
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing is PAX is special for now at least in that no Like attention-getting thing will ever work more than once.

1502
01:19:55,864 --> 01:20:03,876
Speaker 1: I mean if someone does that which thing next year And no one's gonna stand for that, but doing every single thing once is awesome at PAX Except the knuckle crack.

1503
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:06,607
Speaker 1: that's gonna happen every goddamn year and luckily it did.

1504
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:08,209
Speaker 2: I was worried It wasn't gonna happen.

1505
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,655
Speaker 1: I was gonna make it happen if it didn't.

1506
01:20:09,937 --> 01:20:11,925
Speaker 2: someone came in and they saved the day.

1507
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:15,240
Speaker 1: that noise is just Surprisingly sickening.

1508
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,049
Speaker 2: That's the greatest.

1509
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:18,618
Speaker 1: So we learned.

1510
01:20:18,638 --> 01:20:29,199
Speaker 1: you know we had the vision like we talked about earlier And we failed to achieve the vision because we did not account for the immediate competence of the people Said it like doing the tag between.

1511
01:20:29,339 --> 01:20:32,974
Speaker 2: I was you know I was worried that okay keynote ends There's gonna be applause.

1512
01:20:33,014 --> 01:20:37,650
Speaker 2: you can't start until the applause and ends and people are sort of getting ready for the Q&A right.

1513
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:45,169
Speaker 2: But and I was like oh no there might be some sort of you know Rock and roll musics for a minute or two before they begin the Q&A.

1514
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:46,521
Speaker 2: I'll have to overpower it.

1515
01:20:46,602 --> 01:20:50,930
Speaker 2: so that was a challenge But that they would just start it right away immediately.

1516
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:53,685
Speaker 2: You know at the moment that I should have you know needed to start.

1517
01:20:53,705 --> 01:20:54,590
Speaker 1: it was there was nothing.

1518
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:56,717
Speaker 1: It was no it was a foregone conclusion.

1519
01:20:57,178 --> 01:21:02,669
Speaker 2: unless I suddenly gained the mutant powers of Banshee the x-man It was not gonna happen, but think about this.

1520
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,939
Speaker 1: This is like in the you know the Mario Party vision.

1521
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:11,421
Speaker 1: if you had the vision and you start the mat And there's already small mushrooms lined up all the way down.

1522
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:14,390
Speaker 2: That's pretty much it yeah, but we will reattempt.

1523
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:21,148
Speaker 1: We had another opportunity to test our theory and we now know that it is in fact solid gold.

1524
01:21:21,249 --> 01:21:21,650
Speaker 1: it worked.

1525
01:21:22,012 --> 01:21:30,830
Speaker 1: We were in line for the closing ceremonies the omega-thon finale And we were like right in the friggin front of the line like right where the people are who do the in-line entertainment.

1526
01:21:30,971 --> 01:21:32,883
Speaker 1: I think it's step in line game something like that.

1527
01:21:33,407 --> 01:21:33,890
Speaker 1: we talked to him.

1528
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:43,368
Speaker 1: They're pretty cool people But they decided to have a dancing contest and they're like we need a guy and a girl and me and Scott look at each Other and we look at our friend Katsu.

1529
01:21:43,388 --> 01:21:45,816
Speaker 1: and Scott starts yelling katsu.

1530
01:21:46,217 --> 01:21:46,599
Speaker 1: katsu.

1531
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:47,662
Speaker 1: I was looking around.

1532
01:21:47,723 --> 01:21:49,810
Speaker 2: I'm like oh, it's gotta be an FRC person.

1533
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:51,505
Speaker 2: I'm like who who who?

1534
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:53,311
Speaker 2: Katsu.

1535
01:21:53,953 --> 01:21:55,497
Speaker 1: and Katsu looks up with this what?

1536
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,142
Speaker 1: and then you know the same thing.

1537
01:21:57,342 --> 01:21:58,365
Speaker 1: I start yelling katsu.

1538
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:00,150
Speaker 1: Scott embraces my katsu.

1539
01:22:00,893 --> 01:22:01,957
Speaker 1: Everyone else starts joining in.

1540
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:04,426
Speaker 1: the whole freaking line joins in.

1541
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:11,910
Speaker 1: people didn't even know his name - yeah - yeah - so you've got like thousands of people yelling katsu's name.

1542
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:14,021
Speaker 1: There's a circle formed around him, and he's screaming.

1543
01:22:14,081 --> 01:22:14,744
Speaker 1: I swear to God.

1544
01:22:14,785 --> 01:22:16,352
Speaker 1: I will kill you all Mm-hmm.

1545
01:22:16,874 --> 01:22:20,307
Speaker 1: so of course he has to go up and do it and of course he wins.

1546
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:24,401
Speaker 2: of course That's why I wasn't gonna pick someone who was gonna fail.

1547
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:25,485
Speaker 2: I mean if I would have picked rim.

1548
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:29,302
Speaker 2: It would have been like okay Not a winner fail.

1549
01:22:29,824 --> 01:22:31,753
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could have won it But I katsu.

1550
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,704
Speaker 1: if anyone could have won it it was katsu, and he did.

1551
01:22:34,724 --> 01:22:36,189
Speaker 2: he won it by a zillion.

1552
01:22:36,209 --> 01:22:48,716
Speaker 2: I Realized now that after having watched that college, and he got a free Cardboard to samurai figure which is a very expensive toy, but I saw it on eBay if I was him We have a terrible power.

1553
01:22:48,877 --> 01:22:55,326
Speaker 1: if anyone wants to use this terrible power just watch that college humor We link to it works almost anywhere.

1554
01:22:55,608 --> 01:23:02,181
Speaker 1: Yep So getting near the end I think we have to end on this because this was like the moment.

1555
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:10,068
Speaker 1: so in the line You know there's the line up room, which is something that anime cons could probably learn from.

1556
01:23:10,088 --> 01:23:14,170
Speaker 1: of course I don't know if they could manage it the way packs does but regardless in the lineup room.

1557
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:21,807
Speaker 1: It's so happened that as we're all going into you know the biggest biggest event They started playing Bohemian Rhapsody just before the line went in.

1558
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:24,328
Speaker 2: yeah It's like the line is okay guys.

1559
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:27,298
Speaker 2: now You can start walking and then they play Bohemian Rhapsody.

1560
01:23:27,519 --> 01:23:31,050
Speaker 1: so Bohemian Rhapsody is playing and you know people were singing along stuff already anyway.

1561
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:40,130
Speaker 1: So everyone in line starts singing Bohemian Rhapsody But the line goes past the monitors out the door down a long haul way off upstairs and everything.

1562
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,210
Speaker 1: So as a result we're rapidly as a line leaving the already playing Bohemian Rhapsody.

1563
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,569
Speaker 2: So we don't hear it being played anymore at all.

1564
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:50,609
Speaker 2: It's it's in another room far behind us.

1565
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:56,735
Speaker 1: But the crowd kept singing it and kept singing it and kept singing it to a point That was scary.

1566
01:23:56,775 --> 01:23:59,330
Speaker 1: like we're walking the music's long gone in the distance.

1567
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:05,850
Speaker 1: Everyone is still singing all the way through people who were kind of in the area like enforcers who saw the line coming.

1568
01:24:06,231 --> 01:24:11,756
Speaker 1: They're looking up like are they singing Bohemian Rhapsody, and then I thought all right It's gonna die at the instrumental part.

1569
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:13,262
Speaker 1: It did not die.

1570
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:20,550
Speaker 1: people did the instrumental part and We made it all the way through and this is for the Saturday night concerts.

1571
01:24:20,693 --> 01:24:22,453
Speaker 1: I believe yes I believe so.

1572
01:24:22,734 --> 01:24:26,466
Speaker 2: and then right going into the closing ceremonies final omega-thon round.

1573
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,815
Speaker 2: it was repeated They did it again.

1574
01:24:28,835 --> 01:24:30,944
Speaker 1: I think that is the PAX East thing.

1575
01:24:31,004 --> 01:24:31,225
Speaker 1: now.

1576
01:24:31,285 --> 01:24:33,654
Speaker 1: the Bohemian Rhapsody Continued meme.

1577
01:24:33,915 --> 01:24:36,423
Speaker 2: yep it is now a tradition.

1578
01:24:36,564 --> 01:24:36,965
Speaker 1: I mean there's a.

1579
01:24:37,025 --> 01:24:38,370
Speaker 2: let it be set in the stone.

1580
01:24:38,631 --> 01:24:51,050
Speaker 1: There is a point where it's fizzled out almost like everyone's kind of going you know But everyone's got it going in their head, and then someone comes out with the right timing.

1581
01:24:53,012 --> 01:24:54,076
Speaker 1: It was so beautiful.

1582
01:24:54,096 --> 01:24:54,859
Speaker 1: I could have cried.

1583
01:24:54,899 --> 01:25:07,605
Speaker 1: that was that was a moment that deserved a man tear yeah, and then to cap off the whole week we had in Boston we get in the cab to go back to the airport and What plays on the radio, but Bohemian Rhapsody?

1584
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:11,387
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was kind of weird So I don't know.

1585
01:25:11,427 --> 01:25:16,631
Speaker 1: in conclusion PAX East was 90 to 95 percent of the awesome that is PAX West.

1586
01:25:16,732 --> 01:25:16,972
Speaker 1: it was.

1587
01:25:17,434 --> 01:25:27,304
Speaker 2: the one thing at PAX East that really Got me compared to pretty much every other convention ever was that basically people were constantly coming up to me Yeah, being like hey.

1588
01:25:27,344 --> 01:25:28,709
Speaker 2: Hey, it was like non-stop.

1589
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:38,431
Speaker 2: You know it was actually weird like I mean when I'm at conventions even PAX West Right you know some people come up, and they're like hey like hey, but it's not Right it's not like you know.
