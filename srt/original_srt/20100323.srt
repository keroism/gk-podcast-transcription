1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,258
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Tuesday March 23rd.

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,041
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,408
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:16,836
Speaker 0: your pecsies 2010 Survival guide.

5
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:25,508
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,886
Speaker 0: Hey, uh, it's coming.

7
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:32,150
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

8
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,335
Speaker 0: It's coming shit.

9
00:00:33,355 --> 00:00:34,820
Speaker 0: This is the last show before it comes.

10
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:38,665
Speaker 1: No snap Hey, might as well be here.

11
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:39,889
Speaker 1: I don't know.

12
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:46,247
Speaker 0: I cannot say if pecsies is going to be 100% as awesome as pecs west.

13
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,112
Speaker 1: I have a feeling there will be more people.

14
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:56,418
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that by I am unsure Vastly surpass pecs west in terms of number of people in the coming years.

15
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:58,112
Speaker 0: yes I'm talking like by 20 or 30 thousand.

16
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,870
Speaker 1: But I am curious as to the culture of pecsies.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,929
Speaker 1: you see pecs west was able to build its culture from the lowly Necro Wombicon up and up and up right.

18
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,340
Speaker 0: it also built kind of in a weird vacuum.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,123
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

20
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:22,946
Speaker 0: in the east we have this incestuous like a million gigantic anime cons and gaming cons and everything and there's A lot a huge overlap of all these cons, but then out west I mean the cities are further apart And there's fewer people in each location.

21
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:27,600
Speaker 0: not that many people from pecs west went to all these other conventions in the area.

22
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:31,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also you know remember the new york comic-con was pretty.

23
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:47,755
Speaker 1: you know every convention I've ever been to right as built up small to big over time Otakon started a hotel con The New York comic-con started, but I was about to say That the New York comic-con is pretty much the only con that went zero to gigantic.

24
00:01:48,015 --> 00:02:12,733
Speaker 1: you know immediately boom first con Gigantic thousands of people and it had serious serious problems for years as a result, so I am wondering if pecs east despite the awesomeness of pecs and the awesomeness of all the people getting the shit done will they be able to handle the zero to maximum size Immediate you know increase or

25
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:13,055
Speaker 0: not?

26
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,080
Speaker 0: at least they have read.

27
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:21,350
Speaker 0: And they have a lot of the pecs west enforcers and from what I can gather a lot of people who normally go to pecs West are kind of flying out for this thing.

28
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:21,934
Speaker 1: That's good.

29
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:22,960
Speaker 1: That's that's necessary.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,753
Speaker 1: We need them to to be the seed to spread the correct mood about.

31
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,859
Speaker 0: there are two completely separate factors there.

32
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,144
Speaker 0: on one hand There's the logistics.

33
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,993
Speaker 0: I mean can it be the same?

34
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:35,865
Speaker 0: Seattle is a very Different city.

35
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:36,408
Speaker 1: it's a different.

36
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,199
Speaker 1: It's a different convention center a different city different people.

37
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,034
Speaker 0: They're very similar convention centers like surprisingly similar when you think about a little bit.

38
00:02:44,074 --> 00:02:46,120
Speaker 1: They have models the head of verticals.

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think they both will have better staff like local staff.

40
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,440
Speaker 0: then say the Baltimore Convention Center.

41
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:55,488
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know the anime Boston.

42
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,753
Speaker 1: the staff were not so great.

43
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:02,433
Speaker 0: You know the convention center staff Yeah, but they were at least four or five times better than the Baltimore staff.

44
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,978
Speaker 0: That's more like the DC staff.

45
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,596
Speaker 1: That's true Yeah, well it remains to be seen regardless if it sucks.

46
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:11,283
Speaker 1: It's not our fault Yeah, of course.

47
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:23,838
Speaker 0: It's tough because we've you know if paxi somehow fails and does not live up the expectations All we're gonna say is well Everything we said was based on pecs West which we will continue to go to.

48
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,891
Speaker 0: yes Well I think it's gonna be good in the long run.

49
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,140
Speaker 0: I mean paxis is probably gonna be great.

50
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,595
Speaker 0: It's gonna be different.

51
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:37,638
Speaker 0: definitely They've brought a lot of the same culture like look the same kind of concerts the same concerts.

52
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:38,564
Speaker 0: in fact It's the same.

53
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,014
Speaker 1: it's the same concerts every year.

54
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:45,920
Speaker 0: It's not any different Yeah, but they're doing a lot of the same stuff, but it'll be interesting because it packs West.

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,095
Speaker 0: It's mostly people who know what to expect like oh the keynotes gonna be this go to the keynote.

56
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:56,230
Speaker 0: the first Q&A is this I mean, maybe at PAX East all these people who've never been to packs before.

57
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:01,866
Speaker 0: they're gonna go to the Q&A and basically actually ask Normal kind of questions.

58
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,734
Speaker 1: Oh you think see it could be a roller coaster situation.

59
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:07,563
Speaker 1: right the people at pax West have mostly been to Pax West.

60
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:11,720
Speaker 1: so it's like up riding the roller coaster again, but people go to pax East.

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,673
Speaker 1: It's like riding the tallest roller coaster for the first time ever.

62
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,180
Speaker 0: remember our first packs.

63
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,899
Speaker 1: There might be thousands of people who are just like.

64
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,427
Speaker 0: I mean the same thing happened with Otacon.

65
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:23,630
Speaker 0: I remember my first Otacon.

66
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,759
Speaker 0: I was dumbstruck at how big that come.

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,520
Speaker 1: well We're gonna talk about this for the rest of the show.

68
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:31,560
Speaker 1: So let's you know get the rest of this stuff out of the way so we can get to it.

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,840
Speaker 0: Well, it is you know it's that season of the year the time when young boys want to play DDR again.

70
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,380
Speaker 1: Well, you know I got the home theater PC, and we all know about step mania the open source.

71
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,160
Speaker 1: I think it's open source pretty sure free programs at least free as in beer.

72
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:50,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is a. it's basically a clone of DDR except It doesn't come with any songs.

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,453
Speaker 1: You know it's basically all the non copyrighted parts, and then you go and you pirate all the songs and the step files You nominally make your own.

74
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:59,062
Speaker 0: that happened to be exactly Identical.

75
00:04:59,102 --> 00:05:00,005
Speaker 1: you download to me.

76
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,172
Speaker 1: download the other ones that are made by the community.

77
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:06,750
Speaker 1: actually I downloaded all the winners of the step mania Contest files from the step mania website.

78
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:07,916
Speaker 0: have you played any of them?

79
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:12,532
Speaker 0: some of them are alright Yeah, but by and large the community made ones are.

80
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,140
Speaker 1: these are like the highest rated community made ones.

81
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,800
Speaker 0: Well watch out the community is really fucked up and a lot of the very like popular ones are just stupid hard.

82
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:23,999
Speaker 0: I'm a loser who spends all my time playing DDR.

83
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,586
Speaker 1: One of them was actually cool.

84
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,815
Speaker 1: It was like a Riverdance kind of situation ooh.

85
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,437
Speaker 1: I could dig that.

86
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,922
Speaker 1: yeah anyway You know.

87
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:32,284
Speaker 1: so I was.

88
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:41,016
Speaker 1: I was thinking that's the obvious move when you want to bring DDR to your home theater PC And you already have you know a dance pad, but then I realized wait a minute.

89
00:05:41,056 --> 00:05:42,520
Speaker 1: I've got this PlayStation emulator.

90
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:48,686
Speaker 1: Why don't I just go and get DDR fourth mix extra mix and fifth mix and kick it old-school Now with the real deal.

91
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:58,339
Speaker 0: the saddest part about what you're about to say is that we in fact had Nice burned physical media of every DDR mix we cared about from the ps1 air which were the three I just mentioned.

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,433
Speaker 0: Those CDs I have worn out to the point of being gone.

93
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,060
Speaker 0: I can't even rip an ISO off of them.

94
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't even find.

95
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,380
Speaker 1: the thing is I'm trying to find these things on the internet.

96
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,304
Speaker 1: I found extra mix.

97
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:11,580
Speaker 1: it works, but it's got this problem where the timing is off.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,890
Speaker 0: So it happened with the legitimate extra mix.

99
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,537
Speaker 1: It's effectively unplayable.

100
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:23,210
Speaker 1: right and if I Downloaded a fifth mix disc I haven't tried it yet When I get home, but I and fourth mix right.

101
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,498
Speaker 1: why is fourth mix is the best DDR ever?

102
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:28,068
Speaker 1: fourth mix Plus is the best DDR arcade ever.

103
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,080
Speaker 1: Why are they the hardest DDRs to find in the world?

104
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,843
Speaker 1: They don't know.

105
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,780
Speaker 1: it's like it's easier to find a third mix than it is to find a fourth.

106
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:37,573
Speaker 1: It fourth is just the best DDR period.

107
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,080
Speaker 1: no DDR has ever surpassed it.

108
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:50,810
Speaker 0: It has the kind of poppy dancy music that I think just peak children of the 80s like to dance to and then it moved more and more into kind of More modern techno II dancing and bump bump bump.

109
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,480
Speaker 1: anyway if I'm ever mega rich, I'm gonna get a fourth mix plus machine.

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,023
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

111
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:55,827
Speaker 0: That is near that.

112
00:06:56,109 --> 00:07:03,680
Speaker 0: I'd like a fourth mix plus machine and independent of that Probably a 12th mix machine that I just modded to be a step mania machines.

113
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,065
Speaker 1: I knew he's got DDR is.

114
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:08,940
Speaker 1: give me the hookup you know and don't tell me to go buy a legitimate Japanese disc.

115
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,867
Speaker 1: That's like impossible.

116
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:10,270
Speaker 0: Well.

117
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:16,280
Speaker 0: I remember back in the day It wasn't that hard to get him remember when red octane was basically Netflix of ps1 games.

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,264
Speaker 1: That was a good day.

119
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:18,469
Speaker 0: red octane had a service.

120
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:20,900
Speaker 1: people don't remember that red octane used to be game rental.

121
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,065
Speaker 1: It did instead of what it is now.

122
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:27,012
Speaker 0: so what their service was was you would say give them like five bucks And they'd mail you as DVD or CD.

123
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,436
Speaker 0: It was the CD of a ps1 game.

124
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:33,478
Speaker 0: You would burn it and mail it back to them the same day, and then they'd mail you another CD.

125
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,408
Speaker 1: It was it Netflix of games.

126
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,172
Speaker 1: Just there are.

127
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,520
Speaker 1: there are other Netflixes of games.

128
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,793
Speaker 0: But red octane specialized in these people only renting games to pirate.

129
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:47,220
Speaker 1: also lots of foreign Japanese games Specifically DDR and such right and actually sold dance pads.

130
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,468
Speaker 1: That's why they make dance pads.

131
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,039
Speaker 1: currently is because of that business.

132
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:53,139
Speaker 0: in fact We went through like seven or eight pairs of the song.

133
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:56,509
Speaker 1: And then the fact that they made pads.

134
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,970
Speaker 1: their business evolved away from the game rental to the pad making and then to the guitar Hero guitar making.

135
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:10,380
Speaker 0: and then well the game Yeah, then no one rented any games from them, but Japanese games and DDR and no one ever rented a game twice.

136
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,618
Speaker 0: Yep for obvious reasons yep.

137
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:25,093
Speaker 0: Also because it was mostly ps1 games, but I remember back then I mean I got fourth mix and fourth mix plus, and we played him like every fourth mix an extra mix Yeah, which together are almost a fourth mix plus arcade machine.

138
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:33,443
Speaker 0: Yep missing a few songs Yeah, but then you know we had all that and this was kind of still in the early days of modern piracy and even like Anime fan subs and all that.

139
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:38,078
Speaker 0: and one day a friend of ours was like I got fifth mix.

140
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:42,258
Speaker 0: Oh shit we spent like a weekend straight playing that game.

141
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,059
Speaker 0: my legs hurt I couldn't walk yeah, and then DDR died.

142
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:46,428
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the same thing.

143
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:51,313
Speaker 1: imagine gathering after you know fallen empires Whatever whatever is dead thing is it keeps coming back.

144
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:52,237
Speaker 0: and for me personally.

145
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,443
Speaker 0: I love DDR And you know what.

146
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,433
Speaker 1: and you gathering keeps coming back.

147
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,692
Speaker 0: It's still really popular Not to us not to us, but to the world.

148
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:01,600
Speaker 0: DDR is not popular to the world.

149
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,680
Speaker 0: It is popular to us and to the people who go to anime conventions and not even a lot of them anymore.

150
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:09,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really sad, but they like that stupid pop and music.

151
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:10,559
Speaker 0: fuck that game.

152
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,508
Speaker 1: But well not too many people like you.

153
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,913
Speaker 1: just one guy really really likes it.

154
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,400
Speaker 0: Maybe it is just that guy.

155
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,325
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it is.

156
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,155
Speaker 0: he's at every con, and you always wasn't.

157
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,432
Speaker 1: he was at katsu cut And maybe he's at every con.

158
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:21,360
Speaker 0: you always see the line.

159
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,707
Speaker 0: Maybe just people standing there trying to play.

160
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:24,850
Speaker 0: they see him there.

161
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,274
Speaker 0: They can't play they leave.

162
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:27,819
Speaker 0: no one actually plays it, but him.

163
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:32,685
Speaker 1: We should have just taken it off the projector Just broken it.

164
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,160
Speaker 0: I don't know why the sound stopped working on just that game.

165
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:43,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, but DDR is to this day possibly one of my favorite games ever like I. just I always want to play it.

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,959
Speaker 1: Yes, it is so fun to have the computer control your feet.

167
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:46,877
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

168
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:51,220
Speaker 0: When was the last time you were in the presence of a DDR machine and not at a convention?

169
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,405
Speaker 0: And you didn't at least want to play it?

170
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,154
Speaker 0: no of course how many DDR machines are there?

171
00:09:56,174 --> 00:10:00,928
Speaker 0: There's like one in Manhattan yeah And there's always Asians.

172
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:02,500
Speaker 0: yeah, so we'll do a quick news.

173
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:05,176
Speaker 0: We weren't even gonna talk about video game news because who cares?

174
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:05,880
Speaker 0: Pax is coming up.

175
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:07,986
Speaker 1: Pax east is the gaming news.

176
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:12,660
Speaker 0: we have to talk about the fact that Nintendo is releasing a new DS.

177
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,871
Speaker 1: That's 3d, and it's supposedly 3d without glasses.

178
00:10:16,152 --> 00:10:16,352
Speaker 0: Well.

179
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:17,898
Speaker 0: Here's the commentary.

180
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,898
Speaker 0: I've seen Nintendo is not going to make a ps3.

181
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:29,977
Speaker 0: They're not going to use the current like high-end 3d technology that you can get like they're selling for Playstations or whatever that they're gonna use for modern Sony TVs.

182
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:33,800
Speaker 0: yep That's way too expensive, and they don't use glasses and all that business.

183
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:40,909
Speaker 0: They're probably gonna do something really cheap and everyone says that it's going to use the camera To look at where your head is and do it.

184
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:46,429
Speaker 0: remember that old demo of the guy who had all the targets on his monitor And he had a webcam to watch where his head was.

185
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,035
Speaker 1: oh really cuz the thing was.

186
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,039
Speaker 1: is there was the reason.

187
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,402
Speaker 1: the thing is There was a DS game or a DS I game.

188
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,867
Speaker 1: all right that there's a video of.

189
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:59,918
Speaker 1: you can watch online and the way this game works is actually uses the camera on The DS I to look at the floor or whatever is behind the can't DS.

190
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:02,550
Speaker 1: And when you move the DS I around.

191
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:04,640
Speaker 1: it moves the picture in the game around.

192
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,040
Speaker 1: So it looks like you're sort of looking into a diorama.

193
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:10,447
Speaker 1: It doesn't pop out of the screen But it goes deep into the screen.

194
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,720
Speaker 1: and the thing is why do you need to me if that's the technology that?

195
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,863
Speaker 1: They're gonna use?

196
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,168
Speaker 1: you know that is cheap.

197
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:19,540
Speaker 1: That is a very you know impressive looking technology.

198
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:21,852
Speaker 1: That is something that is feasible.

199
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:22,677
Speaker 1: right that is 3d.

200
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,132
Speaker 1: The question is the DS.

201
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,080
Speaker 1: I can already do it.

202
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,569
Speaker 1: So why would you make the 3ds to do it right?

203
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,460
Speaker 1: there has to be something different for them to make a new Different piece of hardware to add this technology.

204
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,505
Speaker 1: Require right what?

205
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,773
Speaker 0: one option there is simply potato moto.

206
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:39,616
Speaker 0: They want more money.

207
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:40,900
Speaker 0: It's possible.

208
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:43,019
Speaker 0: They might add some other tchotchke support.

209
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,127
Speaker 1: Maybe you know I would.

210
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:49,020
Speaker 1: I would say it's false advertising to call it 3d right unless it comes out of the screen.

211
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,246
Speaker 1: And this is another problem.

212
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:50,990
Speaker 0: I mean Star Fox was 3d.

213
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,305
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I'm saying.

214
00:11:54,346 --> 00:12:00,633
Speaker 1: is I was pissed in those days too and when people said like quake was 3d You know and I would argue with people cuz it's like look.

215
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,060
Speaker 1: It's on a flat screen.

216
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,085
Speaker 1: It's not 3d.

217
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,296
Speaker 1: if I draw a cube on this piece of paper is that 3d?

218
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:08,730
Speaker 0: well It's a projection of a three-dimensional object in the two-dimensional space.

219
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:12,622
Speaker 1: yes, so if that's 3d then 10d.

220
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:17,358
Speaker 1: then all they need to do then Mario 64 on on the DS right is 3d.

221
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,780
Speaker 1: so the 3d DS is no different.

222
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:21,505
Speaker 1: Might as well be.

223
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:25,060
Speaker 1: it's probably just gonna be like a DS with an Nvidia chip in it or some shit.

224
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,570
Speaker 1: You know well the thing is one.

225
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,980
Speaker 0: the other way they could do it.

226
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,399
Speaker 0: I don't think they will do it this way is if you held it like a book right and Maybe they'll do multiple things magic eyeball.

227
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:36,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get the stereoscopic effect.

228
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:39,054
Speaker 0: you can do that with like normal software anyway.

229
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:41,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very very difficult.

230
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:43,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, it won't work for a lot of people.

231
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,260
Speaker 1: to give people eye strain.

232
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,882
Speaker 1: It'll be a big probably won't work You know.

233
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:57,195
Speaker 0: anyone who doesn't work for just doesn't understand how to do it though That's true, but the thing is is that Nintendo is not gonna make a product that doesn't work for everybody though I will say never happen while it does work for me.

234
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,124
Speaker 0: my whole life I've hated magic.

235
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:02,498
Speaker 0: I've you know when I remember that was like the big craze and all the malls in the 90s, right?

236
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,618
Speaker 1: I spy also was a craze.

237
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:12,826
Speaker 0: But my trouble is I tend to always cross my eyes inward as opposed to outward when I look at those things And it's very hard for me to stop that from happening.

238
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,533
Speaker 0: so the image sinks, but the the 3d.

239
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:16,336
Speaker 0: This is 100% reversed.

240
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:21,639
Speaker 0: So I see everything going in as opposed to out.

241
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:24,664
Speaker 0: That's just my brain.

242
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:25,608
Speaker 0: it can't handle it.

243
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is just your brain.

244
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,260
Speaker 0: What's really going on here?

245
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,569
Speaker 0: We're not sure all the details.

246
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,100
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about the technical details.

247
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,622
Speaker 0: There's a million.

248
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:34,954
Speaker 0: You know it's all a rumor at this point until Nintendo says here's what it is.

249
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,158
Speaker 0: We're calling it the poop.

250
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,194
Speaker 1: yep You see that joke from somewhere on the Internet, I thought of it just now.

251
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:45,945
Speaker 1: all right now They do it.

252
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:50,820
Speaker 0: look 3d is the current buzzword this 3d TVs avatar and Alice in Wonderland.

253
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they dissed HD.

254
00:13:52,628 --> 00:14:05,280
Speaker 0: so they got to do 3d, but right now while it's the big thing They're gonna release the cheap handheld 3d console and all the people who bought basically the the current Demographic of Nintendo are the people who are gonna buy this shit.

255
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,451
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say the same thing I say when I bought the DS right which look this thing is either going to be the virtual Boy, or is it gonna be amazing?

256
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,620
Speaker 0: I don't think so anymore.

257
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,213
Speaker 0: You don't think the DS was virtual boy or amazing.

258
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:26,200
Speaker 0: it ended up being amazing Except once we realize once Nintendo said oh, it's amazing they stopped trying and it actually kind of stopped being amazing.

259
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,632
Speaker 0: What was the last DS game we cared about?

260
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:28,439
Speaker 1: I just bought?

261
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,862
Speaker 1: Edgeworth Investigations.

262
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:31,384
Speaker 1: it's awesome.

263
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,834
Speaker 1: I just haven't played it yet because I've been reading all right name.

264
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:37,850
Speaker 1: another one the The hero.

265
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,260
Speaker 1: what's that called the clash of heroes?

266
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:46,583
Speaker 1: About that in a big way know what the thing is though like I admit I pirated it for the DS Clash of hero.

267
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:50,353
Speaker 1: might magic clash of heroes is coming to the Xbox such and such.

268
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:57,744
Speaker 1: I can play it on the Xbox Live HD so I'm gonna pay for monies for that and that'll be fair and I just won't.

269
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:01,440
Speaker 1: I won't play the DS one anymore because I'll play the HD one, but look at the DS.

270
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,624
Speaker 0: It was a huge camera.

271
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:04,632
Speaker 0: people thought the DS was going to fail.

272
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,827
Speaker 0: back in the day a lot of people like this thing in Which case I said awesome.

273
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:08,591
Speaker 1: I'll own a virtual.

274
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:15,720
Speaker 0: Yes, but back Then the dichotomy was it's either going to be a crazy success and like the new era of gaming or a virtual boy.

275
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:18,573
Speaker 0: The DS I and this new 3ds are not.

276
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,180
Speaker 0: they cannot be virtual boys.

277
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:26,660
Speaker 0: They're going to be either middle of the middle of the grode like milk toast mediocre or they're gonna be money makers.

278
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:36,066
Speaker 0: Maybe that there's a tiny chance of awesome but there's almost no chance of virtual boy because virtual boy one was a hideous monstrosity a Disaster.

279
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:38,099
Speaker 0: it gave you a headache just looking at it.

280
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:40,286
Speaker 0: No one bought it like it was an.

281
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:45,180
Speaker 0: it was such a disaster that it was almost more popular as a result.

282
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,204
Speaker 0: It was so bad.

283
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,449
Speaker 0: It's kind of awesome.

284
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,312
Speaker 0: It's dangerous.

285
00:15:48,392 --> 00:16:02,848
Speaker 1: The only thing approaching most danger The only thing I have to add right is that whenever a Nintendo has tried to like sort of refine a handheld portable system right, like they refine the GBA into the the the What's it called the SP right it was.

286
00:16:02,868 --> 00:16:03,872
Speaker 1: there is a refinement.

287
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,900
Speaker 1: they were applying the gameboy into the gameboy pocket.

288
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:11,110
Speaker 1: the refinements that were successful were always the first refinements the DS into the DS light.

289
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:19,617
Speaker 1: and the reason those refinements were successful is because the original Version was had some hideous flaw usually being too gigantic to battery hungry.

290
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:20,480
Speaker 1: No backlight, etc.

291
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:28,867
Speaker 1: Right the further refinements the GBA micro, you know and such and such Just prey on people who have extra money.

292
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:41,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the DSI these were you know relative Failures, you know because they basically, you know, DSI is better than the DS light, but it loses the GBA slot You know, it's not a refinement.

293
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:44,300
Speaker 1: It's sort of like an Yeah, you're right.

294
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:58,220
Speaker 1: So I think that if you are the kind of person who wants to save money right, what I would do is wait for the 3d the D the 3ds light and That will be the first refinement and you can just keep that forever and that'll be perfect.

295
00:16:58,483 --> 00:16:59,940
Speaker 0: This is the problem with Nintendo.

296
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:10,160
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go way back to the money level because the we I would say in terms of like Profitability and like good move for Nintendo all told and the DS are we're like the best thing they ever could have done.

297
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,628
Speaker 0: I mean they the intent that we sold like crazy.

298
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:14,636
Speaker 0: It's still ultra popular and important.

299
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:23,664
Speaker 0: but Nintendo has gotten to the point with me to where I no longer buy even their first party titles sight unseen It used to be.

300
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:24,347
Speaker 1: I do.

301
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,675
Speaker 1: I do buy their first party title sight unseen.

302
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,079
Speaker 1: Where the fuck are they?

303
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:36,319
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for Metroid other M. I'm waiting for Freaking Mario Galaxy 2 or even the big sound waiting for another Zelda game, right?

304
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,530
Speaker 0: Where is the next Advanced Wars right?

305
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,060
Speaker 1: You know, where is Advanced Wars DS again?

306
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,823
Speaker 1: Where is?

307
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:47,690
Speaker 0: but even then look we'll look at on the DS, you know Zelda game That's worse than the previous Zelda game that came out.

308
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,357
Speaker 1: Where's Mario Kart Wii 2, you know?

309
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,530
Speaker 1: They aren't even making Mario Tennis 2 or anything.

310
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,846
Speaker 1: Where are the first party games are not existent because that's not Another Mario Party.

311
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:02,020
Speaker 0: I don't think those games are Nintendo's primary demographic anymore.

312
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,020
Speaker 0: I don't think those make them nearly as much money.

313
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:08,860
Speaker 1: The last one was New Super Mario Brothers, which I'll wait until it's cheaper, but that's the other problem.

314
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,027
Speaker 0: We no longer have the urgency.

315
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,755
Speaker 0: I don't think Mario Party N came out.

316
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:14,478
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

317
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:15,803
Speaker 1: I need it today That's not.

318
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:18,114
Speaker 1: but if it was Zelda it was Zelda new.

319
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:19,160
Speaker 1: I would need it today.

320
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:20,210
Speaker 1: I don't know if I do.

321
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,962
Speaker 1: it was Metroid other M I needed today.

322
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:28,867
Speaker 0: Nintendo always had this special place for me where I would buy their games at full price right away Because I had to play them.

323
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:29,370
Speaker 0: they were great.

324
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:34,547
Speaker 1: if it was Smash Brothers, you know Royal rumble insanity.

325
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:35,630
Speaker 1: Yes, I buy today.

326
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:41,308
Speaker 0: but look at PC gaming now I wait on anything that isn't multiplayer.

327
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:45,341
Speaker 1: That's and even then I only I know and I would half-life episode 3.

328
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,849
Speaker 0: I wait for anything that isn't.

329
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,627
Speaker 0: unless I can get all my friends to also wait and if they'll do that I wait even on multiplayer games.

330
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,279
Speaker 0: I just I no longer have urgency.

331
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,260
Speaker 0: and Nintendo's the weird spot because their first party games usually don't get cheaper anytime soon.

332
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:03,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it almost makes me just not bother with them anymore.

333
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:06,071
Speaker 0: while PC I'll wait and buy a game for five bucks that I never play.

334
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:07,015
Speaker 1: Yep on Steam.

335
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:12,576
Speaker 1: Oh Well, I don't know that I still would not bet against a Nintendo portable platform.

336
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:13,560
Speaker 0: I would not bet against it.

337
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,938
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a moneymaker guarantee it but it's not gonna be new Mario Brothers.

338
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:22,703
Speaker 1: We is $43 on Amazon Used cop.

339
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:24,510
Speaker 1: the cheapest used copy is 38 49.

340
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,558
Speaker 1: So it's gonna be some waiting.

341
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,190
Speaker 0: Yep But the 3d DS is not for us.

342
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,333
Speaker 0: I don't think I don't know.

343
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:32,396
Speaker 1: We'll see what games come out for.

344
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,058
Speaker 1: 3d advanced wars.

345
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,626
Speaker 0: What could that add to advance war?

346
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:39,454
Speaker 1: you can fly the airplane planes on top of a boat?

347
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted.

348
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:45,438
Speaker 1: You can move guys up and down.

349
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,320
Speaker 1: They're actually standing on a mountain up above shooting down on another guy, but I can already do that in Final Fantasy Tactics.

350
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:56,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe Final Fantasy Tactics 3d, but I don't like those games anymore.

351
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:59,072
Speaker 1: Phoenix, right 3d You got to look around behind.

352
00:19:59,112 --> 00:19:59,900
Speaker 0: that would be cool.

353
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,915
Speaker 0: If you had a crime scene you guys to get it.

354
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:07,372
Speaker 0: in 3d You hold the DS up to your face and walk around in a semi VR world plus.

355
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:09,297
Speaker 0: remember remember this here's the.

356
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,379
Speaker 0: here's the crux.

357
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:15,580
Speaker 0: We will think of a thousand awesome things that Nintendo will never do.

358
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:21,415
Speaker 0: Nintendo is going to make one game that almost achieves that to prove that the console is viable.

359
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:26,380
Speaker 1: 3d Mario Tennis where Mario is Like out in front of the DS and the your opponents are deep in the DS.

360
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:34,706
Speaker 0: Once they make that one game that proves what it's capable of on some small level Every other game is gonna be basically a phantom hourglass.

361
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:44,980
Speaker 0: - yep things of the day.

362
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,634
Speaker 1: College humor again, but you might not have watched.

363
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:49,720
Speaker 1: you might as well just rim.

364
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,428
Speaker 1: You might as well just make your thing of the day.

365
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:52,392
Speaker 1: college humor.

366
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:54,060
Speaker 1: comm slash videos RSS feed.

367
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,194
Speaker 0: However, there are two classes of people that this will be relevant for.

368
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,905
Speaker 0: I mean of all of our listeners from what I can gather.

369
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:11,246
Speaker 0: almost none of you actually go to college humor on a regular basis to watch the videos and - I don't watch all the videos I kind of only watch the ones that I know are gonna be good and I think you have this - the kind of College humor sense of

370
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:14,700
Speaker 1: you can look at a thumbnail and the title and tell if you want to watch a video or not

371
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,588
Speaker 0: At least 90% of the time.

372
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:19,440
Speaker 0: Yep, but this was a video that I would not have watched.

373
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,600
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have even thought about it cuz there's a million videos like this.

374
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,853
Speaker 0: It's a guy who sings like 32 songs in eight minutes.

375
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:24,940
Speaker 0: No big deal.

376
00:21:25,683 --> 00:21:29,718
Speaker 0: I was working on some geek night stuff ahead of packs and I just kind of clicked on it in the background.

377
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:32,120
Speaker 0: figure out listen To it not watch it while I'm doing something.

378
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:40,180
Speaker 0: This is a surprisingly nerdy and awesome collection of songs that this guy sings and I don't want to spoil anything for you.

379
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:49,673
Speaker 0: I think you should just learn what songs are in this list organically but Any song no matter what the lyrics are sounds pretty great.

380
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:53,547
Speaker 0: If you sing it as a ballad with an acoustic guitar Mmm, okay.

381
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,354
Speaker 1: So let me tell you about this story, right?

382
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:56,820
Speaker 1: There's a Nintendo DS game.

383
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,300
Speaker 0: I thought you were gonna tell me about the Fresh Prince Prince of Bel-Air.

384
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:03,573
Speaker 1: No, I. just there is a Nintendo DS game called imagine babies fashion.

385
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,857
Speaker 1: Look at the look at this game.

386
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:08,652
Speaker 0: All right Is that the baby's brand or is that some other baby?

387
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:09,416
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

388
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:12,911
Speaker 1: It's babies with a Z. It's imagine babies fashion with a Z.

389
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:13,453
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

390
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:14,920
Speaker 0: Wait, where are you going with this?

391
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,520
Speaker 0: I can.

392
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,146
Speaker 0: I can foresee ranging from.

393
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,660
Speaker 0: it's actually a good game - it was banned somewhere for accidentally being child porn.

394
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:22,865
Speaker 1: No, okay.

395
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:23,708
Speaker 1: So here's the story.

396
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,740
Speaker 1: There is a forum called the neo gaff forum, right?

397
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,454
Speaker 1: It's a famous video game forum where all sorts of video game people go.

398
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:30,695
Speaker 1: It's.

399
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:31,900
Speaker 1: it's very famous and popular.

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,087
Speaker 1: I don't go there, but it is famous and important.

401
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:51,060
Speaker 1: There was a guy on this forum named Kua Hoga c-u-y-a H-o-g-a, right and he posted in a thread about Imagine babies fashion about how he actually liked it And of course a typical lowbrow shit cock internet flame war ensued.

402
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:56,757
Speaker 1: Of course people calling him a pedophile, which I suspect he may be.

403
00:22:56,897 --> 00:23:02,348
Speaker 1: I'm not I can't But he likes his baby's fashion game.

404
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,875
Speaker 1: chance of pedophilia greater than zero.

405
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:06,960
Speaker 0: right might just really be into fashion.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:19,558
Speaker 1: I mean it does he have adults fashion - I have no idea regardless Right in this flame war in one post He said or typed so I'm a pedophile because I don't want to play.

407
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:21,266
Speaker 1: dude, bro My shit is fucked up.

408
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:25,726
Speaker 1: So I got to shoot slice you to colon It's straight-up dog time question mark.

409
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:31,277
Speaker 1: to throw around these sort of accusations of someone who seeks to do something different suggests quite the insecurity on your part.

410
00:23:32,782 --> 00:23:35,032
Speaker 1: He came up with this amazing game title.

411
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:36,860
Speaker 1: dude, bro, my shit is fucked up.

412
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,236
Speaker 1: So I got to shoot slice you to it's straight-up dog time.

413
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:40,920
Speaker 0: I would play that.

414
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:48,139
Speaker 0: I mean that sounds like the alternate title for Bayonetta, so Him coming up with this game title, right?

415
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,688
Speaker 1: spawned the Awesomest awesomest outpouring of creativity.

416
00:23:53,868 --> 00:24:06,557
Speaker 1: Well, not the awesomest ever but a huge internet outpouring of creativity as people began to create Concept art for this game Titles for this game mock-ups of this game and it seems like people are actually making this game.

417
00:24:06,577 --> 00:24:08,818
Speaker 1: dude, bro My shit is fucked up.

418
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:12,059
Speaker 1: So I got to shoot slice you to it's straight-up dog time.

419
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:16,220
Speaker 1: May is probably going to become a real game and as you can see there are many parodies.

420
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,547
Speaker 1: For example, the president has been kidnapped by ninjas.

421
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:22,600
Speaker 1: Are you a bro enough dude to rescue the president GI, bro.

422
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:24,767
Speaker 1: What is a bro?

423
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,940
Speaker 1: a dog whose shit is yet to be discovered?

424
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:30,359
Speaker 1: Dude, bro, my shit is fucked up.

425
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:35,439
Speaker 1: And then when you cheat instead of choosing single-player or our multiplayer you choose bro-low or bromance.

426
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:41,759
Speaker 1: So here's a mega man, but in the back is dude, bro.

427
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,608
Speaker 0: This actually is interesting.

428
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,714
Speaker 1: What will dude bro do?

429
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:46,599
Speaker 1: he's fighting a hoot-hoot.

430
00:24:48,202 --> 00:24:50,539
Speaker 1: Is a dude not entitled to the sweat of his bro?

431
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,989
Speaker 1: Dracula says what is a dude bro?

432
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,319
Speaker 1: a miserable little pile of straight-up dog time.

433
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:03,504
Speaker 0: so You know what this is.

434
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:06,477
Speaker 0: this is kind of weird like internet culture.

435
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:07,260
Speaker 0: like before.

436
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,578
Speaker 1: I noticed you were laughing so hard to dude, bro that you had to pause the show.

437
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:13,200
Speaker 1: Finish you're laughing and then come back into it.

438
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,087
Speaker 0: Well, the studio audience was also laughing.

439
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:19,385
Speaker 1: but you see this is what happens when you don't use a shitty college humor thing of the day Like rib, right?

440
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:22,580
Speaker 1: He's a high quality dude, bro thing of the day.

441
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,855
Speaker 1: In fact, I think it might be bro bro of the day bro of the day.

442
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,274
Speaker 0: Maybe that'll be a thing of the bro bro of the bro.

443
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:31,579
Speaker 1: Anyway, dude of the bro.

444
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, bro, that's right.

445
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,242
Speaker 0: So, you know what?

446
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:41,600
Speaker 0: This is remember back in the day the Photoshop Fridays like the old Photoshop Fridays and something awful.

447
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:49,220
Speaker 0: there were basically one picture and then people just took that one picture and kept like adding to it or doing things with just that one picture.

448
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,400
Speaker 0: like This whole kind of meme narrative evolved that was self-referential.

449
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:59,072
Speaker 0: Mmm, dude, bro is very reminiscent of that and you don't see that as often anymore.

450
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:05,880
Speaker 0: all the Photoshop II things and everything now are much More like people take a concept and run with it in many many different directions.

451
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:14,877
Speaker 1: The one thing that I have learned from dude, bro And I'm gonna I think you know I just want to get to the pack stuff right is that I think the solution to the internet is to turn

452
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:15,659
Speaker 0: at the final boss

453
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:16,347
Speaker 1: Yes,

454
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:17,364
Speaker 0: or the square boss No

455
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,226
Speaker 1: Just the solution right.

456
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,640
Speaker 1: the answer is to turn flame wars into creativity.

457
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:26,960
Speaker 1: If someone's having a flame war just start making don't just post like the oh really owl.

458
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:33,160
Speaker 1: You have to start posting shit specific to that flame war in the photoshopped and funny video category.

459
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:36,529
Speaker 1: Right turn all the negative.

460
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,332
Speaker 0: You know what that is.

461
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:38,174
Speaker 0: That's FARC.

462
00:26:38,736 --> 00:26:40,300
Speaker 1: I know right, but you got to spread it.

463
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:46,559
Speaker 1: So anytime there is flame warring on the internet We have to create with to turn that energy into creativity.

464
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:47,122
Speaker 1: point You know.

465
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:49,092
Speaker 1: take any energies on the internet that are.

466
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,500
Speaker 0: you realize what you found here?

467
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,367
Speaker 1: So turn them into creation.

468
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:56,625
Speaker 0: you do realize this is a source of infinite energy Exactly.

469
00:26:56,645 --> 00:26:58,133
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

470
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,540
Speaker 0: It is perpetual.

471
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:10,420
Speaker 1: Imagine if we could harness all of the flame war on the internet and use it to boil water For like and then run it that steam through a turbine.

472
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:15,876
Speaker 1: We could power freaking a rocket to go to the moon or in the very least, you know much time.

473
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,484
Speaker 0: much more relevant We can end.

474
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:18,834
Speaker 1: we could live 10 Pokemon.

475
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:22,046
Speaker 0: We can make a valve game Steam.

476
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:29,223
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah Not as funny as all the stuff that I've been saying but much more relevant because you see that creativity can only be used to Make creative things.

477
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:30,469
Speaker 0: we can't make physical things yet.

478
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:31,152
Speaker 1: Mmm.

479
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:32,779
Speaker 1: It's a secret to every bro.

480
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:42,658
Speaker 0: So Very very briefly and we're gonna skip a lot of it now because we can talk about it in the real part of the show the meta moment.

481
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,184
Speaker 0: Cosmos is the book.

482
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:45,525
Speaker 0: read it.

483
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,312
Speaker 1: Yes read Carl Sagan's cosmos.

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,786
Speaker 1: We're gonna try to stream as much as we can.

498
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:23,214
Speaker 1: we might have to resort to audio only.

499
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:26,843
Speaker 1: we've never really tried this before totally Experimental.

500
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:30,859

Speaker 1: Oh, it should just be like audio only say Awesome You got to put the Guinness logo on there also.

503
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:58,800
Speaker 0: Stream up to the extent that the data cards we have rented will allow us coupled with the bandwidth we can steal.

504
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:04,383
Speaker 0: So ever for things that don't get streamed you can also expect pretty big data squirts Period.

505
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:08,640
Speaker 1: we're gonna be putting the pictures direct to flicker from our phones and all this kind of stuff.

Speaker 1: Well, there's a Twitter will go down.

530
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,593

531
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not using that for this.

532
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,917
Speaker 0: We're gonna use that after we figure out how much bandwidth you assholes take up, right?

533
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:35,805
Speaker 1: So Keep an eye out.

534

548
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:35,160
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, so you should come to the mocha arts festival if you're a human being within distance of New York City.

00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:37,088
Speaker 1: No, excuse it's wicked cheap.

Speaker 1: You don't really need to come both days unless you're really into it and you want to maybe want to see panels on both days Or something like that.

554
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:47,472
Speaker 1: There aren't really that many panels.

555
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,080
Speaker 1: I think there's one panel room period.

556
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also to be honest.

557

00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:02,864
Speaker 1: you're waiting in lines and that you know, we're just chilling in New York We'll hang out all night.

Speaker 0: Maybe we'll we should.

564
00:32:04,993 --> 00:32:07,206

565
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,059
Speaker 0: Well, I'll go to Barcade.

566
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:09,828
Speaker 1: Everyone goes to Barcade.

567
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:10,613
Speaker 1: We should go somewhere else.

568
00:32:10,794 --> 00:32:11,600
Speaker 0: I want to go to Barcade.

569
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,829
Speaker 0: I've suddenly inspired to go to Barcade and get ridiculous.

570
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,757
Speaker 1: It'll be so crazy crowded and stuff.

571
00:32:15,797 --> 00:32:16,400
Speaker 1: It's too popular.

572
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:16,641
Speaker 1: We got it.

573
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:17,565
Speaker 1: We're less popular place.

574
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:20,800
Speaker 0: I want some shitty dive bar with like one broken miss pac-man machine.

575
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,792
Speaker 1: No, we can just go somewhere, you know, where.

576
00:32:23,932 --> 00:32:24,475
Speaker 0: fun spot.

577
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:31,018
Speaker 1: Yeah If you live in New Hampshire, we're probably going to fun spot sometime between PAX East and anime Boston.

578
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:36,096
Speaker 0: just me and rim Biggest arcade in the world follow the geek nights Twitter.

579
00:32:36,136 --> 00:32:40,080
Speaker 0: if you're in Boston There's a good chance that you can hang out with us a little bit.

580
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that that was possibly the most egotistical sounding thing I've ever said.

581
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,255
Speaker 1: I don't know.

582
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,851
Speaker 0: Yeah If you're there You might be able to hang out with us.

583
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:53,380
Speaker 1: if you're there and you want to hang out with us You definitely can unless you're a fanboy getaway.

584
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:56,699
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's get on to the non meta bits.

585
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:25,440
Speaker 1: I Think that we are in sort of a unique position here and that we are probably some of the only people who went to PAX West more than once and also have an experience with you know, the Convention Center in Boston Yeah, and have sort of an inside track on the convention a little bit, you know.

586
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:37,420
Speaker 1: And I think that we may be more qualified than most people to give you the survival guide to PAX East Which is there's an asterisk there because we are basing all of this on everything.

587
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:44,430
Speaker 0: we're extrapolating from what we know about the people running PAX East and What happened at PAX West coupled with our knowledge of anime Boston?

588
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,640
Speaker 1: Yep, and many other things we have knowledge of like conventions in general.

589
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,648
Speaker 1: We've been to a ton of them.

590
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,140
Speaker 0: We may be wrong.

591
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:55,120
Speaker 0: And also if it's like the year 2040 and you're listening to this it's probably changed.

592
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:57,215
Speaker 1: Go listen to the PAX East 2011 coverage.

593
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:05,948
Speaker 0: I mean I listened to our old like Otacon like what to do at Otacon and it was perfectly valid back then Doesn't really work so much.

594
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:08,824
Speaker 0: Oh really about the artist alley What are we saying?

595
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:09,386
Speaker 1: What do we say?

596
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,400
Speaker 0: Well artist alley in terms like what sales change like a hundred percent.

597
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,719
Speaker 1: Oh, we were talking about remember back when the law that's not a survival guide for an attendee, but that is true.

598
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,303
Speaker 0: We did remember the advice of you know, just show up late at the line on Thursday You'll be right through.

599
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:22,826
Speaker 0: get your badge.

600
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:23,870
Speaker 0: that doesn't apply anymore.

601
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:25,096
Speaker 1: Oh that changed that year.

602
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:25,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

603
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:28,429
Speaker 1: Okay Anyway, so here is the PAX East survival guide.

604
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:33,145
Speaker 1: number one thing you have to remember is that Parking in Boston sucks ass.

605
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,007
Speaker 1: It costs a fortune.

606
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:38,719
Speaker 0: Don't don't even like try just park outside and take a cab and don't take the tea.

607
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:43,195
Speaker 1: And you know, we were gonna take the bolt bus, but we bought tickets too late.

608
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,521
Speaker 1: So it was actually like $50.

609
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:48,914
Speaker 1: Fucking jet blue is like $200 total for the round trip flight.

610
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:50,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's so cheap.

611
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,106
Speaker 1: It gets in there in 45 minutes.

612
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:55,498
Speaker 0: This sort of advice is too little too late for anyone who's going.

613
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,646
Speaker 1: probably Okay, so here's some advice you can use.

614
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:58,108
Speaker 1: number one.

615
00:34:58,168 --> 00:35:03,520
Speaker 1: Remember PAX East doesn't start until 2 p.m On Friday, so, you know what you should do on Friday.

616
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:06,260
Speaker 0: You should hang out in Boston with all the PAX people.

617
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:10,100
Speaker 0: It is going to be like a cloud of locusts descending onto that fair city.

618
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:16,473
Speaker 0: I mean Seattle tiny little city Pax not nearly as big as they say it is because they lie about the attendance numbers.

619
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:22,079
Speaker 0: smaller than Otacon but still big When packs ended and before packs began.

620
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:23,564
Speaker 0: Everywhere you went.

621
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,671
Speaker 0: there's like a hundred packs people everywhere.

622
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:25,992
Speaker 0: Yep.

623
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:28,700
Speaker 0: So every restaurant every bar every bathroom every street.

624
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,560
Speaker 1: Just go to any cool place in Boston, you know leading up to PAX East and they'll be packs people hanging out.

625
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,027
Speaker 1: They'll be in like the comic store.

626
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:36,975
Speaker 1: They'll be up in the restaurants.

627
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:37,678
Speaker 1: They'll be.

628
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:40,963
Speaker 1: They'll be up in the Apple Store the Trident cafe I don't know.

629
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:45,968
Speaker 1: We're gonna have to wait until like, you know after packs in between I'm not gonna try to eat there during a convention.

630
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,015
Speaker 1: However, they're during the week.

631
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:50,469
Speaker 0: Well, let's talk about that on food Later, all right.

632
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:55,093
Speaker 0: So yeah, basically Anyone you meet and it'll be obvious who the packs people are.

633
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,620
Speaker 0: packs people all kind of look the same.

634
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,230
Speaker 0: They look like 20 to 30 something gamers wearing gamers.

635
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,536
Speaker 1: You can tell who's a packs person if you can.

636
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:03,860
Speaker 1: what are you doing there?

637
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,685
Speaker 0: You're gonna see Timbuktu bags.

638
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,668
Speaker 0: You're gonna see laptops.

639
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:08,575
Speaker 0: You're gonna see DS's PSP's.

640
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:08,956
Speaker 1: Yep.

641
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:14,829
Speaker 1: Now remember Um PAX East even though it begins at like 2 p.m.

642
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,491
Speaker 1: Right?

643
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:27,048
Speaker 1: I believe that you can actually get into right PAX East much earlier than 2 p.m You'll be able to get in and start waiting in line I think earlier than that.

644
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:29,965
Speaker 1: if you look at the official PAX East Twitter It will tell you.

645
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:33,340
Speaker 1: I think maybe even 10 is the time that you can go wait in line.

646
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,215
Speaker 1: I'm not exactly sure but the point is is that you can go.

647
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,699
Speaker 1: Here we go up that did.

648
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:41,400
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

649
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,793
Speaker 0: Go on.

650
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:45,766
Speaker 1: Okay What did you do?

651
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,400
Speaker 0: I accidentally opened a browser tab that played stuff.

652
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,949
Speaker 0: Okay, that's fine.

653
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:54,931
Speaker 0: You can look up what you're looking up.

654
00:36:58,459 --> 00:36:58,800
Speaker 0: It was.

655
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,490
Speaker 0: She told me her name was Billie Jean Mel caused a scene.

656
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:17,659
Speaker 0: She's just the girl who said that I am the one But the key is not my son Tee hee hee.

657
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:28,997
Speaker 0: Tee hee hee Are you finished looking up whatever you're looking at?

658
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,239
Speaker 1: I'm having a hard time finding it on this page.

659
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:35,927
Speaker 1: Oh here we go, I got it.

660
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:40,001
Speaker 1: Okay Yes, the lineup indeed starts at 10 a.m.

661
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:41,466
Speaker 1: On Friday 8 a.m.

662
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:42,570
Speaker 1: On Saturday and Sunday.

663
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,945
Speaker 1: So the thing is, you know, you want to wait in line at like Otakon.

664
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:46,568
Speaker 1: Oh, it sucks.

665
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:46,950
Speaker 1: It sucks.

666
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:48,389
Speaker 1: It does suck at PAX.

667
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,530
Speaker 1: The line is awesome because you're sitting you're indoors and there's PAX people everywhere and basically it's like this.

668
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:54,499
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a party.

669
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,530
Speaker 1: It's not really a line.

670
00:37:55,651 --> 00:38:02,389
Speaker 0: We are I mean at PAX West Lineup is inside the convention center in a room that is dedicated to lining up.

671
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, that it's gonna be the same at PAX East.

672
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:06,130
Speaker 1: I think there's gonna be a queue room.

673
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,815
Speaker 1: I'm pretty like 90% positive.

674
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:13,110
Speaker 1: Now the thing is they're going to open the doors to the exhibit hall and the keynote simultaneously.

675
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:15,758
Speaker 1: So you're gonna wait in this.

676
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:20,501
Speaker 1: you're gonna wait in this line and then it's at you know And you can get in the line as early as 10 a.m.

677
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:32,410
Speaker 1: And then at 3 p.m they're gonna open and you can go in the exhibit hall or you can go into the keynote and Pretty much there's no reason to go into unless you are like the person who really really wants to play like a game.

678
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:36,669
Speaker 1: That isn't out yet, you know There's no reason to wait in the exhibit hall line.

679
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:40,430
Speaker 0: Yeah well Go into the exhibit hall for one long stint.

680
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:43,410
Speaker 0: Whenever you can get into the exhibit hall like plan it out.

681
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,701
Speaker 0: Don't do it right away on any day because that's whatever other assholes doing it.

682
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:46,902
Speaker 1: Yep.

683
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:48,467
Speaker 1: Go to the keynote.

684
00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:49,270
Speaker 1: It's mandatory.

685
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:53,773
Speaker 1: I mean Wil Wheaton, I'm not even like a big fan of this Wil Wheaton guy I'll admit.

686
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:58,210
Speaker 1: and he's done the keynote before you can watch his old one on the internets or on the PAX DVDs.

687
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:00,739
Speaker 1: But you can't miss the keynote.

688
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,248
Speaker 1: You just can't you gotta go.

689
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:07,330
Speaker 0: You know if you're used to anime conventions or gaming conventions like other than PAX.

690
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,524
Speaker 0: The keynote at PAX is not just a keynote.

691
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:13,076
Speaker 0: It is the opening ceremony It is the con.

692
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:14,845
Speaker 0: the con begins at that event.

693
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:15,850
Speaker 1: It is a real deal.

694
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:16,818
Speaker 1: It is not miss.

695
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,730
Speaker 1: if you did not go to the keynote You did not go to pack and we might as well just stay at home.

696
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:28,505
Speaker 0: We believe that the main events hall at the Heinz where anime Boston also puts its main events hall Has an upper tier that packs will have open it.

697
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:33,170
Speaker 1: Absolutely I have like 99% confirmed that they the upper tier does exist.

698
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,670
Speaker 1: Remember we saw it when you're anime Boston during that concert.

699
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:39,069
Speaker 0: It was unused at anime Boston because anime Boston's tiny compared to fax.

700
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:47,830
Speaker 1: The if you look at the back of the PAX badge Which I saw a picture of it specifically lists the upper deck as a room that is available on the back of the badge.

701
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:54,467
Speaker 1: Therefore it is a safe assumption that the upper decks of the you know Main events theater will be open.

702
00:39:54,527 --> 00:40:01,830
Speaker 0: and thus Oh my god If I go to the Friday concert like after our last gonna wait in the upper deck I might just go to the upper deck lay down for the all the concerts.

703
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:03,482
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna go to the upper deck and chill.

704
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:04,450
Speaker 0: it's hard to say.

705
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:09,910
Speaker 1: anyway The point is that there will be ample seating for the main event.

706
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,714
Speaker 0: Yes, you don't.

707
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,770
Speaker 1: if you you only nearly need to wait in the line if you want to be kind of close.

708
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:15,562
Speaker 0: But the keynote is mandatory.

709
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:16,287
Speaker 0: It is crazy.

710
00:40:16,428 --> 00:40:17,213
Speaker 0: Awesome If you ever.

711
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:20,469
Speaker 0: you know other cons the opening ceremonies are like boring or crappy or whatever.

712
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,515
Speaker 0: The keynote is so great.

713
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:26,247
Speaker 0: And right after it is the PA Q&A panel number one.

714
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:29,569
Speaker 1: now This is where we have to talk about my vision.

715
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:31,133
Speaker 0: Ah the vision.

716
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:38,942
Speaker 1: now if you do not know about having a vision go and listen to the old geek nights episode about the vision I foresee and the bamboo small mushrooms.

717
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:40,569
Speaker 0: Yeah as far as the eye can see.

718
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:42,199
Speaker 1: Now there is you know.

719
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,674
Speaker 1: there I have decided that there is a new game We are playing.

720
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:47,730
Speaker 1: the new game is is basically the vision tally game.

721
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:54,879
Speaker 1: Every time you have a vision and the vision becomes reality you score one point and this game will end when we are both dead And that will be the game.

722
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,750
Speaker 0: So are we starting the scores at zero now?

723
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,742
Speaker 0: Are we gonna try to retcon have you any visions that you haven't become reality?

724
00:41:01,123 --> 00:41:03,490
Speaker 0: Do I I envisioned a podcast?

725
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay anyway I Have this vision.

726
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:08,192
Speaker 1: Right.

727
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:20,922
Speaker 1: and the vision is this if you do not know you probably don't if you didn't go to PAX West ever that when Gabe And taiko appear on the stage for a Q&A panel the song every day I am hustling is the intro song.

728
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,268
Speaker 1: it is always the intro song.

729
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:24,549
Speaker 1: one time They forgot to use it and someone reminded them.

730
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:28,684
Speaker 1: They left the stage then re-entered to the song as was necessary.

731
00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:30,410
Speaker 1: You can find a video of this on the YouTube.

732
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:36,310
Speaker 1: I have made a forum thread on our forums with four such videos demonstrating that this is indeed a tradition.

733
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:42,189
Speaker 1: There is a ninety nine point nine percent chance that this will be the intro song to Q&A one and possibly even two.

734
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:57,247
Speaker 1: My vision is this Before every damn hustling comes in over the stereo system and the loudspeakers in the main event hall if the entire keynote audience Of packs because it's immediately after the keynote like you literally just stay seated and then they come out right.

735
00:41:57,287 --> 00:42:04,385
Speaker 0: and it's not just they Come out like rock stars because they are rock stars at this point at the it's you know it's their convention It's you know.

736
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:12,984
Speaker 1: so If everybody were to sing just every damn hustle, and they don't need I don't even really need to sing We just need to chant every day.

737
00:42:13,044 --> 00:42:15,934
Speaker 1: I'm hustling Again in unison.

738
00:42:15,974 --> 00:42:25,107
Speaker 1: the whole theater every the entire audience were to just do this up until the point at which it comes in Over the music it would be the epic.

739
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:29,706
Speaker 0: now It would be a nice kind of welcome to the better coast to gave in taiko.

740
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:30,830
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, right?

741
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,962
Speaker 1: It's like Pax West has never done something quite that epic.

742
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:37,898
Speaker 1: so if Pax East were able to pull this off Immediately from the get-go right?

743
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:44,249
Speaker 1: not only would this say East is better than West bitches Right it would also some first ladies.

744
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:50,226
Speaker 1: It would also set the tone for the remainder of Pax in a very high quality way.

745
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:59,850
Speaker 0: in the same manner that we have a Plan at another big convention of giving all the people who have to line up outside chalk Because we don't want them to like graffiti with markers on the wall.

746
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:12,080
Speaker 0: Yes But if you give them chalk and you do not draw something nice first if the first thing someone draws is a penis It's all over yep, but if we get someone to draw some nice arts And then we give chalk out it will just be nice ours.

747
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,850
Speaker 0: so our goal is to prevent a Pax penis.

748
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:17,870
Speaker 1: Yes, so this is going to set the tone.

749
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,076
Speaker 1: So I need everyone listening to.

750
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:19,880
Speaker 1: this is going to happen.

751
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,770
Speaker 1: is the timing is going to be rough?

752
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,928
Speaker 0: We we learned a long time ago.

753
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:24,994
Speaker 0: Scott And I were discussing this.

754
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:28,869
Speaker 0: we attempted something similar at another con and Otakon a long time ago.

755
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:31,661
Speaker 0: We failed and the reason we failed.

756
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:32,364
Speaker 0: I'll link to it.

757
00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:33,790
Speaker 0: Scott actually pointed this video to me.

758
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,716
Speaker 0: I've never seen it before.

759
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,649
Speaker 0: it's the principles of leadership.

760
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:43,890
Speaker 0: But basically if you try to start something like this in the wrong way, you're just one weirdo loser.

761
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:49,667
Speaker 0: Yep, but if you do it in the right way You are only a weirdo loser for a few minutes, and then you win.

762
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:52,095
Speaker 0: yep So we're doing this in the right way.

763
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:53,760
Speaker 0: This is a calculated move.

764
00:43:53,861 --> 00:43:56,970
Speaker 1: the problem is we need we need proper execution, right?

765
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:57,829
Speaker 1: I will begin.

766
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,058
Speaker 1: Thing is what will my timing be?

767
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:02,710
Speaker 1: will I do it as soon as the keynote is over?

768
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,828
Speaker 1: I think what I'm going to have to do is the keynote will end.

769
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:10,490
Speaker 1: He'll leave the stage right and then like as soon as things are sort of settle settle.

770
00:44:10,852 --> 00:44:17,049
Speaker 1: Then I'll have to begin it at that moment because I can't write because who knows how long it's going to be it It's going to need a few minutes to build up.

771
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:20,002
Speaker 0: It depends on if they're gonna show those ads between.

772
00:44:20,102 --> 00:44:21,910
Speaker 1: so that's the thing is I completely forgot.

773
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:23,790
Speaker 1: I thought this is gonna be easy to get this going.

774
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:29,810
Speaker 1: But this good they usually play ads video ads and music while the crowd is sitting in the events hall.

775
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:34,622
Speaker 1: And if we start this thing up Yeah, if it's like no it's not gonna be 45 minutes.

776
00:44:34,642 --> 00:44:36,089
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a technical problem.

777
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:36,330
Speaker 0: They can't.

778
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,783
Speaker 1: Yeah, depending on how long it takes for them to write.

779
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:41,188
Speaker 1: We're gonna have to.

780
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:49,352
Speaker 1: you know It will take some like some loudness and some effort to get this going above the music and advertisements that may or may not be Playing.

781
00:44:49,392 --> 00:44:49,874
Speaker 0: so no.

782
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:50,819
Speaker 0: No, I thought of something.

783
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,150
Speaker 0: what if they're standing back there?

784
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,629
Speaker 0: They've got the guy with the hustling ready and the crowd starts doing this.

785
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,514
Speaker 0: They decide not to play it.

786
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:59,581
Speaker 0: They just walk out to the crowds hustling.

787
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:00,203
Speaker 1: That's fun.

788
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:00,865
Speaker 1: That's fine.

789
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,190
Speaker 1: It's still epic awesomeness, right?

790
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:08,630
Speaker 1: The point is I'm gonna begin it, you know, we'll beat and leaves the stage, you know things settle sell for like literally like 10 seconds.

791
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:09,594
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna.

792
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:12,970
Speaker 1: I will start on my own because if I start with a group then it doesn't work.

793
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,803
Speaker 1: It has to be me and then I need someone else sort of like.

794
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:17,330
Speaker 0: I believe I will be the second one.

795
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,839
Speaker 0: We'll stay kind of apart from each other.

796
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:20,005
Speaker 1: We need yeah, we need to.

797
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:20,810
Speaker 1: we need to do something.

798
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,543
Speaker 0: The choreographed Scott will start, you know every day.

799
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:25,050
Speaker 0: I'm hustling every day.

800
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:32,130
Speaker 0: That's all you had to do is just say that over and over again in unison I'll be like 10 or 15 feet away and I'll look at him and kind of pointedly be like every day.

801
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:36,170
Speaker 0: I'm hustling like doing the arm throw at him and then he'll throw the arm throw back and we'll do it together.

802
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:44,210
Speaker 0: We need like four or five more Stooges to one by one start doing that with us and Converge on a spot every day.

803
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:50,934
Speaker 0: I'm hustling and If we get enough people to do it the whole crowd will do it and it'll be a beautiful ghost in the shell like second Order Simulac.

804
00:45:50,954 --> 00:45:51,739
Speaker 0: or we shouldn't?

805
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,450
Speaker 1: I shouldn't move from your location.

806
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,007
Speaker 1: You should stay where you are while you are while you were hustling a few people because it award.

807
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,749
Speaker 0: while they're doing it They'll lead a trail.

808
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:01,877
Speaker 1: No It's no good because you need to it's gonna be.

809
00:46:01,897 --> 00:46:03,865
Speaker 1: we need the volume to spread around this.

810
00:46:03,905 --> 00:46:05,050
Speaker 1: you'd realize how big it's gonna be.

811
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:06,350
Speaker 1: Remember that California concert?

812
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:07,533
Speaker 1: Yeah and the upper deck.

813
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:16,330
Speaker 0: but remember you need a core of people to like a few people in one area who then are loud enough to Cause it to spread and then people further away see it and then they start doing it further away.

814
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:17,578
Speaker 1: Just stay where you are.

815
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:18,202
Speaker 1: Trust me.

816
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,369
Speaker 1: I have calculated this.

817
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:21,479
Speaker 0: However, we will probably have the.

818
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,750
Speaker 0: uh, we have an artifact from PAX West.

819
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,902
Speaker 0: I don't know how many will be there, but we were bringing it.

820
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:30,602
Speaker 0: Yes the pip boy It was weird at the first PAX that we went to.

821
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,812
Speaker 0: it was one of the most sought-after Things.

822
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:36,365
Speaker 0: there were a few hundred of them at the con and the people who had them were just.

823
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,613
Speaker 0: they stood out and they used Them to great effect.

824
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:43,850
Speaker 0: the next packs only like 15 or 20 people brought them and those people use them to epic effect.

825
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,013
Speaker 0: Pax East.

826
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:52,696
Speaker 1: years later, there's gonna be like five and those are gonna be epic and I'm bringing mine, you know, hustle it I'm gonna hustle it day.

827
00:46:52,736 --> 00:46:53,379
Speaker 0: I'm hustling.

828
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:54,483
Speaker 1: Alright, so that's what we got to do.

829
00:46:54,503 --> 00:46:55,145
Speaker 1: That's the vision.

830
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:56,851
Speaker 1: Let's make it a reality Okay.

831
00:46:56,912 --> 00:47:02,070
Speaker 1: Anyway, you you know the Q&A panels in all honesty aren't really Q&A panels.

832
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:09,458
Speaker 1: I mean you can Q&A, but usually it's basically your chance as a. you know It's a step up to the mic and make something happen.

833
00:47:09,498 --> 00:47:13,834
Speaker 1: So for example people come up and say hey everybody just so you know Cookie Brigade.

834
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:17,068
Speaker 1: Oh shit, or you know, hey you forgot to play.

835
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:19,698
Speaker 0: every day I'm hustling or a lot of people do cool stuff.

836
00:47:19,778 --> 00:47:21,725
Speaker 0: one guy sang, you know, Rick roll.

837
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:22,990
Speaker 0: one guy played a Rick roll.

838
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:27,165
Speaker 1: Yep, there's those guys who sang the whatever song the this night.

839
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:28,429
Speaker 1: What's it called the?

840
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:30,035
Speaker 1: The horse song.

841
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:33,950
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, or the guys who brought the cardboard cutout of their friend who couldn't be there.

842
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cardboard cutout on stage.

843
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:36,098
Speaker 0: it.

844
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:43,170
Speaker 0: now don't be a jackass and be like, hey Like try to sell something or anything, but got to do something cool.

845
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:46,742
Speaker 0: No, I mean everyone question or you have to have a really good question.

846
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:48,950
Speaker 1: You can't go up and ask the lame question.

847
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:50,500
Speaker 1: You know, it's got to be the high quality question.

848
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,170
Speaker 0: Of course, it's interesting because Pax West.

849
00:47:52,431 --> 00:47:57,850
Speaker 0: I think the reason this culture came was that the same people by and large go to Pax West every year.

850
00:47:58,371 --> 00:48:02,203
Speaker 0: So they already asked all the questions probably like six packs as a go.

851
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:04,330
Speaker 1: Pax East is gonna be a lot of reruns.

852
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:08,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of people asking real questions that would never get asked at Pax West.

853
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:09,289
Speaker 0: I think all right.

854
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:22,770
Speaker 1: Anyway after the P&A panel 1 right Q&A panel 1 my suggestion to you Is that if you want a official Pax merchandise as in t-shirts the official Pax East scarf Pax East?

855
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:26,442
Speaker 1: Whatever you should get the to the merchandise booth.

856
00:48:26,562 --> 00:48:29,030
Speaker 0: that stuff is gonna sell out before the end of the day on Friday.

857
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:29,794
Speaker 1: I don't realize this.

858
00:48:29,814 --> 00:48:30,598
Speaker 1: you go to Otakon.

859
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,207
Speaker 1: you can buy an Otakon shirt.

860
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:39,370
Speaker 1: at Otakon They make a new one every year and like at New York and a festival You can buy merchandise that says New York and a festival with like a little Liberty girl on there.

861
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, the every convention I've been to sells merchandise for itself.

862
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:45,012
Speaker 1: Pax.

863
00:48:45,032 --> 00:48:47,340
Speaker 1: that merchandise sells out every single year.

864
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:50,957
Speaker 1: if you do not get it on Friday or perhaps early Saturday You will not get it.

865
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:52,770
Speaker 1: You will not get a Pax East shirt.

866
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,904
Speaker 1: There are not enough for everybody and if you want one get in line and get one.

867
00:48:57,024 --> 00:48:59,052
Speaker 0: Pax did not expect the response They got.

868
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:02,650
Speaker 0: they did not expect the con to sell out and then extend it and then still sell out.

869
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:03,813
Speaker 0: They are not.

870
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:11,338
Speaker 0: when they decided way back how much merch to print there is no way on this freaking earth They understood how many people are gonna be there.

871
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,890
Speaker 1: They even know they said in their Twitter that it's going to sell out.

872
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:24,006
Speaker 0: Well, they know now But had they if they'd they'd listen to us way back they would have printed like 18,000 t-shirts And probably still sold out.

873
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:26,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you want, right?

874
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,670
Speaker 1: The shirt you you had better there will be a very limited number of Pax shirts available.

875
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:35,666
Speaker 1: If you show up on a Friday, you shouldn't have a problem snagging one though, right?

876
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,510
Speaker 1: That is from the official Pax on Twitter.

877
00:49:38,731 --> 00:49:39,794
Speaker 0: So panels.

878
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,099
Speaker 0: just go to any panel you like.

879
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:51,830
Speaker 0: however, if you go to our panels if you want to see a panel I'm not sure a hundred percent how this will happen But there aren't that many panels at a Pax compared to say an anime con.

880
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:55,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all have breaks in between them, you know, and there really aren't that many.

881
00:49:55,888 --> 00:49:56,330
Speaker 1: each day.

882
00:49:56,651 --> 00:50:02,850
Speaker 1: there's really only three theaters that have panels in them and Pretty much every panel fills up maximum.

883
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:07,350
Speaker 1: So you got to wait in line to go to a panel and like for example our first panel at Pax ever.

884
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,590
Speaker 0: You know Pax west years ago beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

885
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:14,797
Speaker 0: People lined up for like an hour and a half and the room filled up almost immediately and then almost no one got to See it.

886
00:50:15,106 --> 00:50:22,350
Speaker 1: Yep They will not let you in once all the seats are filled But they enforcers will make a very good job of making sure there is an ass in every seat and there are no empty seats.

887
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:30,415
Speaker 0: Yes, but if you were looking for a panel to see our first one beyond Dungeons & Dragons 830 to 930 p.m.

888
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:39,479
Speaker 1: On Friday sadly conflicting with the beginning of the Friday night concert in the Wyvern theater Wyvern Our second panel losing should be fun.

889
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:42,291
Speaker 1: 1130 to 1230 in the morning So

890
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,462
Speaker 0: overnight Friday also in the Wyvern theater

891
00:50:45,482 --> 00:50:55,940
Speaker 1: in theater also conflicting with the Friday night concert Which is if you are a Friday night concert person if you want to see the front a lot the onomatoguchi the Metroid metal The proto men just don't come to those panels.

892
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,065
Speaker 0: Yes, we won't feel bad.

893
00:50:57,126 --> 00:50:58,613
Speaker 0: We're going to record them We're going to put.

894
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:00,563
Speaker 1: if I didn't have those panels at those times.

895
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:01,869
Speaker 1: I'd be going to that concert, too.

896
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,570
Speaker 0: However, I don't feel bad because we're going to go to PAX East or PAX West in like six months and see the same.

897
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,857
Speaker 1: We've already seen all those people.

898
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:10,250
Speaker 0: Yes, and they're awesome, but I don't need to see them again.

899
00:51:10,351 --> 00:51:12,441
Speaker 0: I really just want Joe co to sing to me all night.

900
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:14,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, which will happen on Saturday night.

901
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,421
Speaker 1: Yes, we are not doing anything on Saturday except awesome.

902
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:18,845
Speaker 1: We'll be going to Expo Hall.

903
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:20,290
Speaker 1: We'll be playing games.

904
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,017
Speaker 1: This is something people don't realize our packs.

905
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,824
Speaker 1: It's sort of obvious though.

906
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:25,069
Speaker 1: You got nothing to do.

907
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:27,861
Speaker 1: Oh, none of the nothing on the schedule looks good right now.

908
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:29,970
Speaker 1: I already saw every booth in the expo hall.

909
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,200
Speaker 1: I'm bored.

910
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:32,370
Speaker 1: You can't be bored at PAX.

911
00:51:32,671 --> 00:51:34,035
Speaker 1: You can always play games.

912
00:51:34,296 --> 00:51:41,798
Speaker 1: go to the open PC gaming go to the open console gaming go to the open tabletop gaming Most of all and just fucking play games.

913
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:46,010
Speaker 0: play games all night long and everybody's cool.

914
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:48,001
Speaker 0: I mean even gaming cons.

915
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:49,530
Speaker 0: I've gone to other than packs.

916
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:51,337
Speaker 0: You know you might be used to this.

917
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:52,461
Speaker 0: you want to play a game.

918
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:54,630
Speaker 0: you find one cool guy who wants to play with you.

919
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:56,497
Speaker 0: Two really scary guys.

920
00:51:56,537 --> 00:52:02,141
Speaker 0: you're trying to tell them the games full even though it's not and then you're trying to like slowly Look for the one other cool-looking person around.

921
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:02,543
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

922
00:52:02,865 --> 00:52:03,870
Speaker 0: Everybody's cool at PAX.

923
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:08,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is very rare to deal with an uncool person and the tabletop gaming areas are so happening.

924
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:28,465
Speaker 1: I was in the tabletop gaming area packs West last year and it was like I'd be teaching two separate groups of people to play Agricola at the same time and then I'd bust out a Dominion and then I would you know talk to someone about a game a sushi game that they were playing and ask him if it was good Or not and then I'd get a demo from some guy who's trying to sell a game He made and then I would go and check out another game and that I never heard.

925
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:38,734
Speaker 1: I read the rules and play it And then bust out another Dominion and then teach someone Puerto Rico and then you know It's word of warning though the game that was hot at the last packs a pack Dominion was Dominion.

926
00:52:38,835 --> 00:52:40,039
Speaker 0: it will be hot at PAX East.

927
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,350
Speaker 1: if you want to play Dominion bring your own buy one beforehand.

928
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,230
Speaker 1: If there will be dealers, I know the complete strategist will be in the expo Hall selling games.

929
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:58,760
Speaker 1: I know that Luke crane Jared Sorenson and some friends will be demoing things at that booth and possibly also in the tabletop area and If you they will sell games and there might be.

930
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,170
Speaker 1: there will probably other sellers of games as well.

931
00:53:01,592 --> 00:53:04,469
Speaker 1: But hot games like Dominion will probably sell out.

932
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:07,950
Speaker 1: You should bring your own copy play someone else's copy etcetera.

933
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:14,397
Speaker 0: But my word of warning to you is that there is a very similar game that if you hear the description of it You will think it's the best game ever.

934
00:53:14,517 --> 00:53:17,048
Speaker 0: It's Dominion with dungeon crawling.

935
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:18,553
Speaker 0: It's called Thunderstone.

936
00:53:18,854 --> 00:53:22,626
Speaker 1: a thunderstone has a special inside joke meaning for us it does.

937
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:25,594
Speaker 0: it is however Not that good.

938
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:28,482
Speaker 0: So do not worry about playing Thunderstone.

939
00:53:28,582 --> 00:53:31,150
Speaker 1: I know actually, you know for us it's not that good.

940
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:35,490
Speaker 1: I think the vast majority of our listeners would be like, oh my god Thunderstone so awesome.

941
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:41,273
Speaker 0: Well, just be warned because it's a game that you might start playing that will just drag on forever If they come.

942
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:46,059
Speaker 1: you don't want to play something that's too long because you might right make sure you look at the schedule before you get Into something like that.

943
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:51,181
Speaker 0: and also, you know They'll probably have retro gaming and you know modern gaming.

944
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:57,106
Speaker 0: and usually the way it works is you just go check out a game Find some people and play it and they have a leaderboards and all sorts of cool stuff.

945
00:53:57,226 --> 00:54:02,787
Speaker 1: a very good idea If you want to save time is look for people who are you know game makers like Steve Jackson is there.

946
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:03,670
Speaker 1: just go to him.

947
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:09,569
Speaker 1: Be like hey I need I want to play a game and he'll have a game that you can play and some will teach you to be real Quick and you'll be on the road.

948
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:15,350
Speaker 0: Don't be afraid to go up to those people You know all that like like Luke Crane or Steve Jackson and just ask if they want to play a game with you.

949
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,756
Speaker 0: They very well might just say yes.

950
00:54:17,097 --> 00:54:20,270
Speaker 1: Yeah talking to anyone, you know, everyone at PAX is awesome.

951
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,675
Speaker 1: There's like almost 0% fanboys.

952
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:22,920
Speaker 1: not gonna say 0% but almost 0% fanboys.

953
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:26,695
Speaker 1: You just go to people.

954
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:28,140
Speaker 1: be like they got DS.

955
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,669
Speaker 1: just be like, what's up Mario Kart and people like hell's.

956
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:32,737
Speaker 1: yeah There you go.

957
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:34,970
Speaker 0: Rock and roll till the wireless breaks.

958
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:39,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, also if you are, you know, the dogs are tired at any time.

959
00:54:39,704 --> 00:54:40,867
Speaker 1: head for the beanbags.

960
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:41,770
Speaker 0: Will they be there?

961
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:43,660
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the beanbags will be there.

962
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:44,385
Speaker 0: How do they check?

963
00:54:44,567 --> 00:54:44,869
Speaker 0: I don't know.

964
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:46,155
Speaker 0: There's got to be being.

965
00:54:46,235 --> 00:54:48,966
Speaker 0: I would assume there's gonna be sumos but there's no beanbags.

966
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:50,834
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell That's not packs.

967
00:54:51,175 --> 00:54:52,319
Speaker 1: Ah, I just ain't packs.

968
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:52,780
Speaker 1: We'll see.

969
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,024
Speaker 1: There's gotta be beanbags.

970
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,429
Speaker 1: if there's no beanbags kill yourself.

971
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:03,229
Speaker 1: And always if you ever get to the beanbags and there's a free beanbag just always hold on to one extra one.

972
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:06,890
Speaker 1: that way If I walk by and you have a beanbag saved for me, you'll be my best friend.

973
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:14,390
Speaker 0: So unlike an anime con or a con you might normally go to Where there's a million million events and you have to choose like do I want to go to this or this?

974
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:16,770
Speaker 0: It's really easy to plot your way through packs.

975
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:24,605
Speaker 0: Just look at the panel schedule and look at the concert schedule and circle like the five things You really want to do and split all the rest of the time between eating.

976
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:25,530
Speaker 0: Don't forget to eat.

977
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:28,440
Speaker 0: Hanging out playing games.

978
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:30,150
Speaker 0: hanging out playing games.

979
00:55:31,211 --> 00:55:35,109
Speaker 0: Hanging out hanging out playing games going to the exhibit hall once or twice and that's it.

980
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:35,772
Speaker 0: So there's.

981
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:36,979
Speaker 0: there's nothing else doing it.

982
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:39,030
Speaker 1: The only things you cannot miss the keynote.

983
00:55:39,492 --> 00:55:43,030
Speaker 1: You should probably not miss PNA panel one because you're gonna help me with my vision.

984
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,370
Speaker 1: If nothing else if you have not been to a PAX before you should go to all the concerts.

985
00:55:48,855 --> 00:55:51,062
Speaker 0: Do not leave the concert and go to bed.

986
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:55,175
Speaker 1: concerts will most likely go until 2 a.m When the con closes, right?

987
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:56,760
Speaker 1: I think the con closes 2 a.m.

988
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,886
Speaker 1: Friday and Saturday on Sunday.

989
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:00,373
Speaker 1: I think it closes at 6.

990
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:05,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, right it opens at 2 p.m Well, the line opens at 10 a.m.

991
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,228
Speaker 1: Friday, but the con opens at 2 p.m.

992
00:56:07,288 --> 00:56:07,670
Speaker 1: Friday.

993
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:10,203
Speaker 1: It opens at 10 a.m At 10 a.m.

994
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:11,610
Speaker 1: On Saturday and Sunday.

995
00:56:12,311 --> 00:56:12,732
Speaker 1: There you go.

996
00:56:13,154 --> 00:56:17,450
Speaker 0: now if you have never been to a PAX go to the PA make a strip.

997
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:20,159
Speaker 1: It's awesome, but I've actually never been to it.

998
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:23,470
Speaker 0: We failed because well they I always failed to go to it for some reason.

999
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,263
Speaker 0: They failed last year and we bailed.

1000
00:56:26,947 --> 00:56:30,284
Speaker 1: Oh, right Yeah, there was the tech problem last year and they moved it.

1001
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:30,807
Speaker 1: so we didn't go.

1002
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:31,430
Speaker 1: but we yeah.

1003
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:33,020
Speaker 1: But we were we almost made it.

1004
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,550
Speaker 1: so there is some sort of curse.

1005
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,181
Speaker 1: We never end up going to the make a strip panel.

1006
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,309
Speaker 0: I'm going to try to go to it.

1007
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:38,295
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what?

1008
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:41,030
Speaker 1: I will also try to go to it and hopefully there'll be the hot dog fairy.

1009
00:56:41,391 --> 00:56:42,214
Speaker 0: We have an advantage.

1010
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,041
Speaker 0: the Heinz has the upper deck.

1011
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:46,489
Speaker 1: You want to go to the upper deck for the make a strip?

1012
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:48,898
Speaker 0: good I'm not sure.

1013
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:49,990
Speaker 0: this is total speculation.

1014
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,389
Speaker 0: I will wager the upper deck will be the safe guaranteed way to see any main event.

1015
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:56,638
Speaker 1: Here is a no.

1016
00:56:56,658 --> 00:56:58,250
Speaker 1: So here's some other random advices.

1017
00:56:58,411 --> 00:57:05,155
Speaker 1: Let's say you've got some friends going to packs right like some people on the internets and you want to meet up with them But you don't know where and when.

1018
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:16,450
Speaker 1: one of the best places to meet up with someone is just say hey everyone Go to omega-thon round number one, right because the early omega-thon rounds are actually some of the lesser attended events.

1019
00:57:16,551 --> 00:57:22,594
Speaker 0: However, however, that's tricky because that's at PAX West where you know, people are used to it Hard to say.

1020
00:57:22,795 --> 00:57:24,762
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess you give omega-thon advice.

1021
00:57:24,782 --> 00:57:26,870
Speaker 1: the omega-thon has changed this year, right?

1022
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,151
Speaker 1: What?

1023
00:57:27,171 --> 00:57:32,534
Speaker 1: because they used to have problems where like they would announce they would you know ask you when you registered Do you want to be an omega?

1024
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:33,057
Speaker 1: not and they'd.

1025
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:35,970
Speaker 1: people say no and they have a hard time finding omega notes.

1026
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,950
Speaker 1: What they're doing is at packs at walking into the keynote.

1027
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:42,069
Speaker 1: If you want to be an omega not you will fill out a form.

Speaker 0: That is and the thing is the the general thing to do it packs.

1045
00:58:35,751 --> 00:58:51,358
Speaker 0: This is the one time no matter what you should just line up way early Because that line is kind of the end run of the con and everyone lines up you all go in They fuck up the technology for like an hour and then they have the final round of the omega-thon And then packs ends and everyone walks outside.

00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:00,881
Speaker 1: It is a half-hour break.

1075
01:00:01,022 --> 01:00:03,730
Speaker 0: We'll probably just keep doing stuff in that room.

1076
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:08,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard though that action castle is also going to include jungle adventure.

1077
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,248
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

1078

Speaker 0: if you are an old man and you Cannot stay up until 2 a.m.

1088
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:46,549
Speaker 0: For two concerts two days in a row And this is your only packs you can ever go to I Would recommend going to the Saturday concert over the Friday concert if you have to choose.

1089
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:53,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Paul and storm are kind of like a more modern more vulgar version of the Smothers brothers.

1090
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:55,855
Speaker 0: No They're not as funny.

1091
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,927
Speaker 0: I would say as the Smothers brothers, but they've been taller vibe.

1092
01:00:59,088 --> 01:00:59,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're cool.

1093
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,056
Speaker 1: They've been touring with Jonathan Colton.

1094
01:01:01,096 --> 01:01:04,090
Speaker 1: So and Jonathan Colton, it's also the video game Orchestra.

1095
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:05,481
Speaker 1: Yes, Paul and storm.

1096
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:12,510
Speaker 0: then Jonathan Colton But and usually remember MC front a lot will probably slip in and sing at least one song with all these guys.

1097
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:17,164
Speaker 1: Maybe I can guarantee you that Jonathan Colton will slip in and sing with emcee front a lot.

1098
01:01:17,224 --> 01:01:25,028
Speaker 0: Jonathan called Friday night is Almost my favorite part of every packs, even though he sings the same goddamn songs every pack.

1099
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,218
Speaker 1: Well 90%.

1100
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:28,807
Speaker 1: Did you see that epic picture I showed you?

1101
01:01:28,888 --> 01:01:35,690
Speaker 0: Yes But it's just like your dad singing to you with an acoustic guitar and it's just the nicest thing in the world.

1102
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,051
Speaker 0: And you just.

1103
01:01:36,112 --> 01:01:37,899
Speaker 0: it's the whole crowd singing with him.

1104
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:38,822
Speaker 0: It's so great.

1105
01:01:39,325 --> 01:01:40,529
Speaker 0: I love it so much.

1106
01:01:41,053 --> 01:01:42,747
Speaker 1: Alright, is there any other?

1107
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:43,773
Speaker 1: Paxing.

1108
01:01:43,894 --> 01:01:49,841
Speaker 0: so if you want to eat food Yo, we know the Boston area from other cons.

1109
01:01:50,162 --> 01:01:50,925
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

1110
01:01:51,587 --> 01:01:53,193
Speaker 0: if you have money It's easy.

1111
01:01:53,534 --> 01:02:00,579
Speaker 0: walk out the front of the convention center not the mall entrance, but like the main entrance Walk two blocks away from the convention center.

1112
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:02,905
Speaker 1: There is a street with all sorts of little fancy restaurants.

1113
01:02:02,925 --> 01:02:03,907
Speaker 0: They're super fancy.

1114
01:02:03,948 --> 01:02:04,870
Speaker 0: They're super expensive.

1115
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:06,637
Speaker 1: They're super not super expensive.

1116
01:02:06,678 --> 01:02:09,610
Speaker 1: They're just you know, they're expensive medium expensive.

1117
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:12,700
Speaker 1: It was a. if it was like Yelp, they would be $2 signs.

1118
01:02:13,322 --> 01:02:14,747
Speaker 0: They range from like 10 to $30 for lunch.

1119
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about right.

1120
01:02:16,554 --> 01:02:18,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we're kind of spoiled by New York.

1121
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,330
Speaker 0: I mean think of the average con goer like a McDonald's I don't know a little pricey.

1122
01:02:22,335 --> 01:02:33,230
Speaker 0: Okay If you do not so and also if you need to get away from someone That is the way to go because you can usually divide up to a fancy restaurant get a reservation and get away from the crowd.

1123
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:35,469
Speaker 1: There's also an Apple store and stuff like that.

1124
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:41,870
Speaker 0: The crowd of the con probably will not go over there that often because they're not gonna know about all those restaurants.

1125
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:45,130
Speaker 1: Most of the people are going to be going to the food court in the mall.

1126
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,696
Speaker 1: This is attached to the convention center.

1127
01:02:46,716 --> 01:02:47,900
Speaker 0: avoid it at all costs.

1128
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:49,507
Speaker 1: avoid that food court.

1129
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:50,390
Speaker 1: It will be doomed.

1130
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:56,130
Speaker 1: You'll be waiting in line for like an hour to get like a mediocre taco at Qdoba or some shit.

1131
01:02:56,271 --> 01:03:05,290
Speaker 0: So if you need cheap food walk out the convention center Like the main entrance turn left and walk off into what looks like kind of a shadier area.

1132
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:12,840
Speaker 1: There's bodegas and cheap restaurants and stuff over here is a secret to everybody if you turn to the right Near the food court.

1133
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:18,470
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's near the food court But sort of outside near like these outside tables kind of down in the street.

1134
01:03:18,891 --> 01:03:22,705
Speaker 1: There is a grocery store around near the convention center somewhere.

1135
01:03:22,725 --> 01:03:23,829
Speaker 1: I think it's a shaw's right?

1136
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:25,073
Speaker 1: Yeah I hope it's still there.

1137
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:28,989
Speaker 1: You can go to the grocery store and get freaking food that you can eat.

1138
01:03:30,111 --> 01:03:36,064
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna be no line, you know, even though there's a gigantic invention You're just gonna be a walk in the grocery store get food.

1139
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:36,829
Speaker 1: It's gonna be all good.

1140
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:38,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll cost a grocery store.

1141
01:03:38,617 --> 01:03:41,670
Speaker 1: Normal price is normal grocery store and it's food.

1142
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:43,805
Speaker 1: It's probably better than the food court also.

1143
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:49,250
Speaker 0: So hell yeah Nope If you have time at all and also this place is cheap go to the Trident cafe and get breakfast or lunch.

1144
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,637
Speaker 1: Good luck waiting in line.

1145
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:52,930
Speaker 1: There's a line to get into the Trident cafe at anime Boston.

1146
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:54,396
Speaker 1: You're gonna be waiting all day to eat.

1147
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,610
Speaker 0: There's a line to get into the Trident cafe on a normal day.

1148
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:59,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I'm not eating there until the week.
