1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,270
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Thursday July 9th on rim.

2
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:15,340
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:21,060
Speaker 1: We would like to live forever, maybe we're not really sure so we did a show about.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:34,933
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, so you might be wondering why I'm gonna bring this up But I'm not talking about it.

6
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,002
Speaker 1: the thing that I'm talking about is not the topic.

7
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:41,697
Speaker 1: the topic is the the manner in which the thing Was enacted.

8
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:43,330
Speaker 0: why do we you know?

9
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:49,507
Speaker 0: I think that's one thing we've always done in geek nights is whenever we're gonna talk about something We sort of delay saying what the something is.

10
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,050
Speaker 0: I know Why do we have that shtick?

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,956
Speaker 0: Where did that shtick come from?

12
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:55,725
Speaker 1: I was thinking why didn't I just say it?

13
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:56,670
Speaker 1: Where did that even come from?

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,256
Speaker 1: I didn't even plan on doing that.

15
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,950
Speaker 0: It's like we don't do it in regular talking in real life.

16
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,337
Speaker 0: We don't do it panels and we're talking to people.

17
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:07,870
Speaker 0: we only do it on the show usually at the beginning of a segment.

18
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:09,017
Speaker 0: Why do we do it?

19
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:09,942
Speaker 0: Where did it come from?

20
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,089
Speaker 0: Why can't we stop doing it?

21
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:12,013
Speaker 1: It's so.

22
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:13,820
Speaker 1: it's just like cavemen talk back in the day.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,984
Speaker 1: we couldn't stop that.

24
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:19,000
Speaker 1: we weren't even sure when it started But one day we forgot how to use burbs.

25
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:23,384
Speaker 0: for now on I'm making a conscious effort not to do that And that's it so anyway.

26
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,353
Speaker 0: Oh my god God.

27
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:27,042
Speaker 1: anime convention we go every year.

28
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:40,748
Speaker 1: We've been going since like 2002. we've been panelists there since 2003 and We always do like panels and events and stuff at these big anime and gaming conventions And there really aren't any Thursday conventions we go to.

29
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:43,063
Speaker 1: yet I guess open everything would count.

30
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:52,057
Speaker 1: but anyway Yeah, so then they finally really late this year published the schedule for the convention at least Most of the schedule.

31
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:54,409
Speaker 0: yeah, they always publish the schedule you know before.

32
00:01:54,449 --> 00:02:01,230
Speaker 0: well You know some amount of time before the con usually a week or few and the schedule a. it's looking like a pretty good schedule.

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,615
Speaker 0: I'm liking the violent movies.

34
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,201
Speaker 0: I'm seeing I'm liking the events.

35
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:06,630
Speaker 0: I'm liking you know Fred Schoep panels.

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,370
Speaker 0: I'm like in concert every day.

37
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:14,205
Speaker 1: I'm really liking Mostly is that because we're only doing three things and we don't have any other stuff to do.

38
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:16,293
Speaker 1: I can pretty much do Whatever.

39
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,006
Speaker 1: I want in this guy and no artists alley.

40
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:18,167
Speaker 0: yeah.

41
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,598
Speaker 0: Secondly right they made they did a good thing.

42
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:30,549
Speaker 0: they made this schedule used to be published as a PDF right Which was nice for printing it out, but it was not so nice because they really couldn't update it.

43
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:39,150
Speaker 0: so now they've got an interactive schedule where you can click on the individual events to see their descriptions and You know they're gonna update the schedule in real time.

44
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:43,201
Speaker 0: So if you're at the convention And you go to the website the schedule will be updated like to the minute.

45
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:49,409
Speaker 0: so if something gets cancelled or moved you can Always check the website even during the con and find out and that's a good thing.

46
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,242
Speaker 0: But they don't have the PDF and the schedule.

47
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:55,630
Speaker 0: the interactive schedule is unprintable.

48
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:57,449
Speaker 1: Well here here's here's what I would say.

49
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,759
Speaker 1: Conventions like Otacon have the resources.

50
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,064
Speaker 1: they could get them to get someone to do it.

51
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:02,690
Speaker 1: hell Conrad could do it trivially.

52
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:08,570
Speaker 1: They should make an iPhone app and the only thing it does is every year you have the live.

53
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,043
Speaker 0: Oh don't even need an iPhone app.

54
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,916
Speaker 0: You just need a Web page that is iPhone.

55
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:15,702
Speaker 0: You know specifically duns.

56
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,187
Speaker 0: You know yeah thing is.

57
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:22,989
Speaker 1: I'm sure they'll add that This is just a situation where something was just good enough to be used a year early.

58
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,877
Speaker 1: rather I mean think if they didn't turn it on now.

59
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,143
Speaker 1: They wait till next year.

60
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:30,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyway This is actually good because it's actually putting the descriptions.

61
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,364
Speaker 0: That was very good because it saved me a lot of time.

62
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,330
Speaker 0: usually we get to the con.

63
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:39,898
Speaker 0: We have to like read the descriptions of all the movies that we want all the violent movies and all these panels that have really Bad titles.

64
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:44,286
Speaker 0: you don't know what they're about To sit there like in the hotel reading these things in a little pocket guide.

65
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,423
Speaker 0: now I read them beforehand so it's gonna save me a lot of time and thinking at the con.

66
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:58,819
Speaker 1: now the interesting thing about doing Panels and being speakers at events like this is that I have to do a lot of you know Communication with the people on the back end.

67
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:03,475
Speaker 1: you're basically being the producer for geek nights and Every convention is totally different.

68
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:15,050
Speaker 1: some like all like packs or the New York Anime Festival the New York comic-con are Super professional, and it's literally like basically because I talked the lingo And I give them what they want they'll ask for like eight.

69
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,440
Speaker 1: So what's the ad copy you want in the book?

70
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,490
Speaker 1: you know this many words?

71
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,579
Speaker 1: Give it to me by this day, and it's very straightforward and professional.

72
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:22,125
Speaker 1: some guys like kinetic.

73
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:30,616
Speaker 1: on one year We showed up We looked at the con book we saw what panels they had schedule is for and then we showed up at those and ran those Panels the year prior.

74
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,266
Speaker 0: to that though is the exact opposite.

75
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:32,870
Speaker 0: we showed up.

76
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,734
Speaker 0: They knew who we were.

77
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:42,548
Speaker 0: they gave us folders that our names on them full of all the information We needed with itineraries and badges and the whole thing that was the con were one of the panels that we did.

78
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:51,181
Speaker 1: the description in the con book Basically said yeah this we've done this panel at Otacon and anime ball These other cons and we'd like to do a kinetic on.

79
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:53,170
Speaker 1: we need this much equipment blah blah blah.

80
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:56,149
Speaker 1: And that was what they put in the description in the con book.

81
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:03,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, they obviously did not read what they're putting in the con book and you know the the professionalism varies from con to con.

82
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:23,707
Speaker 1: anime Boston despite being a fan run con like Otacon Probably the most together con outside of the professional cons We've dealt with but Otacon this year clearly humans did not read What they were putting in the schedule because we're doing three panels And I'd like to read for you the panel description that is in the book from anime.

83
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:35,723
Speaker 1: You should see This is a frank entertaining presentation and discussion of the core anime that any self-describing fan would want to see at least once Presented in the quote unquote Ted style much like our beyond Dungeons & Dragons event.

84
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,548
Speaker 1: its nappy focus runs up to 55 minutes.

85
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:43,050
Speaker 1: Then we'll leave with a handout noting all the anime we discussed with a not-so-subtle checklist attached.

86
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:48,284
Speaker 1: That wasn't the description I gave Otacon to put in the con book.

87
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,550
Speaker 1: that was me telling Otacon what the panel was.

88
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,255
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was not from.

89
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:53,579
Speaker 0: that was not language.

90
00:05:53,619 --> 00:06:00,158
Speaker 0: that was from us to the Congo or that was language for us And runs up to 55 minutes.

91
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was the language of us speaking to the panel staff.

92
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:10,660
Speaker 0: See this, you know, actually I'm gonna blame Technology and I will too.

93
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:20,530
Speaker 0: in the days before copy/paste Someone would have had to read it and type it in a typewriter or read it and write it with a pen and there's no Way they would make this kind of mistake.

94
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:30,085
Speaker 0: but because of copy/paste this sort of job putting together the con book becomes Manual labor as opposed to you know, a literate labor.

95
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:36,370
Speaker 0: You don't need a scribe You just need you know a pair of hands and thus they just copy and paste blindly.

96
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:41,488
Speaker 0: It probably takes forever because they're selecting copy paste select copy best part and they don't.

97
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,933
Speaker 0: they're not looking They're just trying to get it.

98
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:43,897
Speaker 0: get it fucking done.

99
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:49,998
Speaker 1: It was even worse for we're doing beyond Dungeons & Dragons, which Quote and they didn't even get all of it.

100
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:52,830
Speaker 1: Like this is like an excerpt from the middle of just one of the pair.

101
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:57,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, they probably just picked like, you know, the number of words that they needed.

102
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:01,510
Speaker 1: This is a slick professional lecture on the nature of role-playing games.

103
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:03,477
Speaker 1: Slick professional lecture.

104
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,890
Speaker 1: am I gonna put that in like the description in a con book?

105
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,946
Speaker 1: That's that's so I don't know conceited and weird sounding.

106
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:10,910
Speaker 0: That's very bad.

107
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:23,149
Speaker 1: Anyway, making us look bad but they're mistake with a focus on the idea that the systems most people use D&D or more appropriately for Otacon besom is In no way facilitate by nature good or enjoyable role-playing.

108
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:27,822
Speaker 1: Colon the game and the roles are not intrinsically intertwined.

109
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:44,639
Speaker 1: either of the above titles works Because there was a discussion where I pointed out that we could call it either beyond Dungeons & Dragons or beyond besom because besom is this anime role-playing system, but Someone I don't know no human read this clearly.

110
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:51,000
Speaker 0: clearly you ever put the con book together did not read so I hope that's not in the printed book.

111
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:53,069
Speaker 1: if it is probably is authority.

112
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:55,350
Speaker 1: We're much like in other cons.

113
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,410
Speaker 1: We're going to have to read and point out the ludicrousness of it at all of the panels

114
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,875
Speaker 0: Of course, of course

115
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:05,709
Speaker 1: man Otacon you're always so close but Jesus well,

116
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:15,818
Speaker 0: you know I think I'm beginning to think that you know I'm gonna go with what we said before and I had to fix anime cons show, you know And all these cons of all these problems.

117
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,282
Speaker 0: and they blame these problems on not enough staff yada yada yada And basically I'm gonna say tough shit.

118
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:24,736
Speaker 0: You're not doing your job You know and such.

119
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,382
Speaker 0: that's not an excuse anymore.

120
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:32,822
Speaker 1: Here's the thing with with this in particular It is clearly a case of solving the right problem the wrong way.

121
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:36,413
Speaker 1: because the problem is it's very difficult to get the con Schedule together.

122
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:38,402
Speaker 1: It's very difficult to get it together on time.

123
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:39,265
Speaker 1: Of course.

124
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,190
Speaker 1: I know ways to solve that.

125
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:50,304
Speaker 1: But anyway outside there are all these issues with getting panels together and having a schedule ready and available Prior to the con early enough to where you can print it for the con Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:50,611 --> 00:09:09,084
Speaker 1: So instead of getting someone smart to do it in a proper way or anything They decided to invest in technology some sort of automated system where you know They take the submissions from us from this form and just directly translate them into some sort of schedule Which can I can break down in ways that are apparent right here?

127
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:09,706
Speaker 1: Yep.

128
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,929
Speaker 1: Oh Well, yeah, we're gonna be at Otacon though, but and those panels are not.

129
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:19,030
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the description sort of tell you what they kind of do.

130
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,322
Speaker 1: I'm curious who's gonna show up and what they're gonna think.

131
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gonna be very interesting.

132
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:29,090
Speaker 0: Hopefully We can rely on the fact that most people just look at the titles and don't look at the descriptions.

133
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:36,322
Speaker 1: Yes, also the fact that I called anime you should see Cover your bases colon anime you should see.

134
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:37,647
Speaker 1: and in the email.

135
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,056
Speaker 1: They sent me back They just called it cover your bases.

136
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,127
Speaker 1: But in the schedule, they called it anime you should see.

137
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:49,009
Speaker 1: so I'm expecting them to call it like I don't know Rimming cover your cover you should see.

138
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:56,877
Speaker 1: Now I'm expecting the actual description in the title to be anime your bases to be something like Thanks and cheers.

139
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,405
Speaker 1: Let me know if you need any other information.

140
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,169
Speaker 1: rim geek nights.

141
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should maybe call them and let them know.

142
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:05,189

151
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:48,944
Speaker 1: Okay, I got a news here.

152
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:57,396
Speaker 1: This is this is an interesting story And while there's a lot of kind of viral marketing nests about it The story itself is pretty interesting.

153
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:58,379
Speaker 1: to sum it up.

154
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,470
Speaker 1: A musician was traveling flying on United Airlines.

155
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:03,623
Speaker 1: I've flown on United Airlines.

156
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:04,830
Speaker 1: fuck United Airlines.

157
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:11,130
Speaker 1: But anyway, I digress everything is not jet blue sucks because unless it's foreign what I say, I flew United Airlines.

158
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:13,730
Speaker 1: I mean, I've never successfully flown United Airlines.

159
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,724
Speaker 1: Every time I've ever tried to fly United Airlines my flights have been canceled or I've been bumped.

160
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:31,018
Speaker 1: But anyway, so They broke someone's guitar who was traveling and apparently he looked out the window You know watching the luggage get loaded and he saw them just like throw a guitar case and clearly break it.

161
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, and You know, he assumed and it was pretty obvious.

162
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:35,690
Speaker 1: It was his guitar case.

163
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,395
Speaker 1: So he tells the staff not too many guitar cases per flight They don't care.

164
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:43,190
Speaker 1: and sure enough when he gets to his destination guitar is smash.

165
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:44,634
Speaker 1: So, what does he do?

166
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:52,724
Speaker 1: He goes through the process and says hey look you broke my guitar I'll give me the money to fix it and the airlines like now now not gonna do that.

167
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:53,506
Speaker 0: Really?

168
00:11:53,827 --> 00:12:02,329
Speaker 1: So he's like, alright United I'm going to make three Internet music video songs that I will compose about you and how you broke my guitar.

169
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,156
Speaker 1: And they still ignored him.

170
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:07,590
Speaker 1: and then the first video came out and they bought him a new guitar.

171
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:09,813
Speaker 0: Internet.

172
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,062
Speaker 0: win the Internet.

173
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:13,274
Speaker 1: Well, I Find see here's the thing.

174
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:14,358
Speaker 0: I don't understand right.

175
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,370
Speaker 0: this works so well on United, right?

176
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,090
Speaker 0: How come this doesn't work on say Scientology?

177
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:28,610
Speaker 1: You think Scientology would see the first video and be like, oh shit Well Scientology does but their answer is to sue the people who put the videos up.

178
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,175
Speaker 0: Why didn't Delta go down that road?

179
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:31,877
Speaker 1: I don't know.

180
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,641
Speaker 1: maybe because they don't have any money.

181
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:45,945
Speaker 1: I Just I find it funny and It's interesting that we're seeing more and more that media like the average per.

182
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:57,810
Speaker 1: the democratization of media Will in the end give people a very substantial power over Entities that in the previous, you know, pre democratized media world had power over them.

183
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:12,790
Speaker 1: It's kind of this reverse where you can create on your own Immense bad publicity with almost no proper effort, but then at the same time You only have this power if you have the ability to rise up from the mass of the democratized media.

184
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:16,430
Speaker 1: If everyone's publishing videos your video has to be awesome or no one will care.

185
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,196
Speaker 0: Yeah I'd also like to point out you know This guy has skill at Country music and video making.

186
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:30,687
Speaker 0: someone else who had a guitar broken that did not have as much talent would be Far less able to get their video, you know to get noticed and you know get their money back.

187
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,059
Speaker 1: Yep case in point I mean look at podcast.

188
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:36,814
Speaker 1: who's listening to otaku generation People I guess.

189
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,340
Speaker 0: I guess they gotta have some listeners.

190
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,062
Speaker 0: They still around.

191
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,367
Speaker 1: even I have no idea.

192
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,261
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned I'll stand in my world order the only podcast in the world.

193
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:48,467
Speaker 1: No, they with anime at least I mean fast karate is basically the 24 podcast now.

194
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:51,477
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright anyway that you.

195
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:59,665
Speaker 1: the best thing is you can watch the music video on YouTube and it's it's pretty good though I warn you if you don't like country music You won't like the video.

196
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:00,853
Speaker 0: Yep Alright.

197
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:06,745
Speaker 0: so this is a story probably better for a Tuesday But you know, it's it's brand new news and I hate it when it's like.

198
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:11,787
Speaker 0: it always seems like We do a Tuesday show and then on the Wednesday, there's all this big gaming news.

199
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:14,213
Speaker 0: It's like fuck you Fuck you.

200
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,957
Speaker 1: I've got so much gaming news.

201
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:17,341
Speaker 0: Alright, so crazy.

202
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,323
Speaker 0: It's always the day at.

203
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:20,589
Speaker 0: you know, we did a Monday show Google OS.

204
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,317
Speaker 0: It's like fuck you Monday.

205
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:33,820
Speaker 0: tell us on Sunday anyway Or at least tell us Monday at work not Tuesday, so This is sort of a big gaming news.

206
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,409
Speaker 0: We want to sort of tell the whole story here.

207
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,297
Speaker 0: Way back in the day.

208
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:41,390
Speaker 0: There was a company called the FASA corporation.

209
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:48,613
Speaker 1: I still have my second-edge Shadowrun handbook FASA.

210
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:49,418
Speaker 0: I'm not good.

211
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:51,028
Speaker 0: You can go look up what that stands for.

212
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:57,140
Speaker 0: and They made a game called battle droids But they got sued kind of.

213
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,864
Speaker 0: there was trouble.

214
00:14:57,904 --> 00:15:01,110
Speaker 0: so they changed it to battle tech And battle tech was big.

215
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:14,210
Speaker 0: It was a tabletop miniatures war game and then there was a role-playing game called mech warrior And then there's a video game called mech warrior And then there was mech warrior 2 which is one of the greatest PC games of all time and those mech warrior 3 not so great.

216
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,521
Speaker 0: There's a mech warrior 4.

217
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:16,550
Speaker 0: I didn't even know it existed.

218
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:22,712
Speaker 1: As I point out the last comment in the thread in our forum about this was quote there was a mech warrior 4.

219
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:34,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know though those mech warrior 4 because there was a mech assault And I think there might even been a mech assault 2 for the Xbox which are much less Simulaty because the mech warrior games are very Simulate being in a mech.

220
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:34,818
Speaker 0: the bad.

221
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:37,930
Speaker 0: the mech assault games were very arcade shooter.

222
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:55,550
Speaker 0: there was even battle tech VR which is some amazing thing that I think someone still has a bunch of pods and drives them around to places and there was a. Oh there was two games, I think they're like battle tech tactics or command or something like that.

223
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:01,390
Speaker 0: They were basically, you know more like the turn-based strategy game, but on the computer for Windows 95 or something.

224
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:04,127
Speaker 0: I think both of those you can get for free maybe somewhere.

225
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,930
Speaker 0: I don't know anyway.

226
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:22,116
Speaker 0: So what happened was eventually right facet was doing its thing and they also did shadow run and some other stuff but Microsoft bought them Microsoft and that is why you got mech assault mech assault 2 on the Xbox 360 and I think Microsoft made mech warrior 3 And 4.

227
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:22,969
Speaker 0: I'm not you know.

228
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,053
Speaker 0: I guess Microsoft paid something.

229
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:25,177
Speaker 0: license someone else to do it.

230
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:37,988
Speaker 1: Microsoft have such as such deep pockets that with almost any endeavor that they want to undertake They can basically just keep making failures over and over and over again and just look at the market and then just Incrementally improve until they make money.

231
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:48,150
Speaker 0: Yep So you might remember if you listen to the other Tuesday shows it didn't news about Wiz kids games Which was the company that did the mage Knights and the hero clicks and the whole the clicks right the click company and they?

232
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:59,712
Speaker 0: did a mech warrior click game and they also had a subsidiary called catalyst game labs that did like the clap that basically took the classic battle tech from Microsoft.

233
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,141
Speaker 0: so they were doing the tabletop battle tech parts, right?

234
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:10,530
Speaker 0: Well Wiz kids is gone, but Through some machinations that I do not know catalyst game labs is there and is stronger than ever.

235
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:15,410
Speaker 0: I thought that Wiz kids going away was gonna be bad for battle tech, but I was wrong.

236
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:24,349
Speaker 0: I was so wrong because not only are there these amazing video trailers going around of Mech warrior 5 which is just gonna be called mech warrior.

237
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,507
Speaker 0: It's which is the new mech warrior video game that will come at some point for PC and Xbox.

238
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,590
Speaker 0: That looks amazing.

239
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,828
Speaker 0: Who knows if it'll play amazing, but it looks amazing.

240
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:43,770
Speaker 0: Mech warrior 4 and all of its expansions are now free for downloading or they will be free for downloading Very soon on the catalyst game labs website.

241
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:49,225
Speaker 0: You know classic battle tech is no longer called classic battle tech.

242
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:50,630
Speaker 0: It's just called battle tech.

243
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,620
Speaker 0: So I think what they've done is they've sort of fixed the naming right?

244
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:04,050
Speaker 0: It's no longer classic battle tech for the tabletop It's just battle tech and the video game is mech warrior, and I think I'm not sure though I think mech warrior the tabletop roleplay game is to dead.

245
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:07,570
Speaker 0: I can't confirm that though But that's what I'm thinking and that's you know.

246
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,450
Speaker 0: I think that's a good way to go with the naming battle tech for the tabletops and mech warrior for the video games.

247
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:16,890
Speaker 0: but regardless One of our favorite things in the world battle tech is coming back.

248
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:18,511
Speaker 1: Battle.

249
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,099
Speaker 0: check it out the way my goss rifle pitch.

250
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,084
Speaker 1: We have such good memories of playing that Somewhat unintelligible game laid into the night at our IT.

251
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:29,987
Speaker 0: Hey too much.

252
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,449
Speaker 1: Um, Jason face I wonder if Pete Hill still has it that character sheet the one mech sheet.

253
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:37,561
Speaker 1: Yet a perfect quad neck won't go down.

254
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,950
Speaker 1: It was an 80-ton mech fully loaded.

255
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:43,286
Speaker 1: There is not a single scratch on it whatsoever.

256
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:46,797
Speaker 0: It is pristine Except that all strife will to the face.

257
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,203
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry full to the head.

258
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,009
Speaker 1: No head mechs dead.

259
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:53,749
Speaker 1: If we were playing the campaign, oh my god the salvage.

260
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:57,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but you got it.

261
00:18:58,017 --> 00:19:02,373
Speaker 0: you got to check out these trailers like especially the one with the dude ejects after the Atlas grabs them.

262
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:05,458
Speaker 1: oh shit, I Have hope I have guarded.

263
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,089
Speaker 0: optimism is I'm looking for any look at this.

264
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,670
Speaker 0: There's suddenly like in the past week the Lucas arts the battle tech.

265
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:17,055
Speaker 0: If you bring back the TIE fighter and you bring back the mech warrior I'll have and you bring it back proper.

266
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:20,105
Speaker 0: Like I'll have an excuse to buy the stupid Logitech joystick.

267
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:20,847
Speaker 0: Please.

268
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:21,810
Speaker 0: Give me that excuse.

269
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,981
Speaker 1: It's like suddenly PC gaming not.

270
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:25,810
Speaker 1: well PC gaming has been up and down forever.

271
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,426
Speaker 1: But PC gaming the way I want it has been almost researching.

272
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:31,410
Speaker 1: It's so close.

273
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,418
Speaker 0: All these games are just I can taste it.

274
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:36,449
Speaker 0: and if nothing else let's play some tabletop battle tech.

275
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:44,678
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

276
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:45,963
Speaker 1: I have two things of the day.

277
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:50,179
Speaker 1: one is an actual thing of the day and one is just Too important not to talk about one.

278
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:58,710
Speaker 1: Here is an archive of photos of Every single phone booth that still exists on the island of Manhattan in New York City.

279
00:19:59,352 --> 00:20:09,370
Speaker 1: there is one at 101st Street one at 100th Street one at 90th Street and One at 66th Street all on West End Avenue.

280
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:11,476
Speaker 0: I know more phone booths than that.

285
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:23,339
Speaker 0: No, see there's plenty of pay phones that have.

286
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:28,881
Speaker 0: you know, they're there on the street and they have little things around them You know, but they don't have actual doors like Superman uses.

287
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,110
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking at Clark Kent phone booth.

288
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:34,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, not too many of those not too many of those were ever in Manhattan were they?

289
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:35,407
Speaker 1: there were a ton.

290
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:35,930
Speaker 1: they're all gone.

291
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,342
Speaker 1: Oh phone booth aka a tiny bum apartment.

292
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:43,117
Speaker 0: Oh Now I know why they're all gone.

293
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:48,979
Speaker 0: tiny bums lived in them But there are four.

294
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,087
Speaker 1: there are pictures of them.

295
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:56,975
Speaker 1: Much more importantly tornado potato Tornado potato.

296
00:20:57,035 --> 00:21:01,254
Speaker 1: tornado potato is a thing that was in Korea Nice, it's a nice.

297
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,518
Speaker 0: Stan Lee would love the tornado.

298
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:02,959
Speaker 0: Yeah.

299
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,802
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

300
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,210
Speaker 1: It has the same feel as a rust hurricane.

301
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:10,264
Speaker 1: But anyway, the tornado potato is something to behold.

302
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:13,655
Speaker 1: I will link to a picture of it but we didn't really have them in the US so much.

303
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:26,490
Speaker 1: but they kind of exploded around the world and Whenever something explodes around the world it eventually ends up in Wildwood, New Jersey Home of schlock, I mean that is where there's the toward the year-round Christmas store.

304
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,410
Speaker 1: That is where DDR landed after it was popular everywhere else in the country.

305
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:38,090
Speaker 1: And now I have a picture I'm looking at right now of tornado potato on the boardwalk right next to the Polish water ice.

306
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:42,470
Speaker 0: Oh Paul, you can get a Polish water ice and a tornado potato right next to each other.

307
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,921
Speaker 1: I can see the Polish water ice is right there.

308
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,347
Speaker 0: Are there dancing girls in the bow?

309
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,454
Speaker 1: There's two Shlubby looking guy.

310
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:53,690
Speaker 0: I wonder what used to be where the tornado potato currently is between the Polish water ice and that Dunkin Donuts.

311
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:55,363
Speaker 0: Oh, so that wasn't.

312
00:21:55,666 --> 00:22:04,412
Speaker 0: that was Some of the Dunkin Donuts very close to the McDonald's in the movie theater and the zombies it is but I think it's to the right Of that right.

313
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,295
Speaker 1: I think what used to be.

314
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:18,542
Speaker 1: there is one of those generic fry shit places could be not the fry shit place where we did the epic deep-fried pizza, but Nonetheless I'm kind of excited about eating the trendy tornado potato.

315
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:19,465
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it looks.

316
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,930
Speaker 0: you know, it doesn't look too bad to me.

317
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,298
Speaker 0: It's basically one potato.

318
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,450
Speaker 0: They put it through a slicey machine.

319
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,098
Speaker 0: You know that makes it a lot into us.

320
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,330
Speaker 0: one solid spiral of potato.

321
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:35,598
Speaker 0: They flavor up they fry it up and to quote someone at potato worth of french fry They then put some schmutz on it.

322
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,302
Speaker 0: Yeah.

323
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,150
Speaker 1: Well, you know, yeah, that's what you do with the potato.

324
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,930
Speaker 0: But I the thing is looking at it I'm skeptical as to whether it tastes as good as Curly's fries.

325
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,989
Speaker 1: Well, it's so gimmicky and Curly's fries basically just cuts a potato into four pieces and fries it.

326
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't beat that.

327
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:53,934
Speaker 0: It's kind of hard to beat cuz it's so potato Deep potatoes.

328
00:22:54,094 --> 00:22:54,977
Speaker 0: All right.

329
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,942
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

330
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,205
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

331
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:03,999
Speaker 1: speaking of tornadoes Wow, that was a segue I didn't even intend.

332
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,838
Speaker 0: yes, we did intend that I intended it very much No idea you knew it.

333
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,104
Speaker 1: so Scott has a video so something.

334
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:19,190
Speaker 0: so, you know, there's snakes on planes What you're going way out, but there's no snakes on trains.

335
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:21,416
Speaker 1: You're gonna pull it back in.

336
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:25,090
Speaker 1: you've almost back in you've almost really back in almost.

337
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:32,874
Speaker 0: But what there are on trains are people cameras train cars and Tornadoes.

338
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:45,033
Speaker 0: what happens when a big Fucking heavy steel freight train probably the heaviest like this incredibly incredibly heavy moving thing meets a Tornado?

339
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:46,981
Speaker 0: a very very powerful thing.

340
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,527
Speaker 0: It's like who's gonna win?

341
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:49,330
Speaker 0: is the tornado?

342
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:53,610
Speaker 0: Just gonna sort of blow around and I'll send all this stuff flying while the train sits there going.

343
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:54,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

344
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:57,606
Speaker 0: I'm a fucking train can't move me or is the train gonna go?

345
00:23:57,626 --> 00:24:03,563
Speaker 0: Oh fuck tornado And blow away and it'll be crazy because it's incredibly heavy thing.

346
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,509
Speaker 0: gets blown away like a paper leaf.

347
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:08,437
Speaker 0: Watch this video find out it's.

348
00:24:08,637 --> 00:24:09,682
Speaker 1: uh, it's pretty epic.

349
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:13,539
Speaker 1: one tell it when the trees are all fine And then suddenly the trees start moving.

350
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:15,007
Speaker 1: It's about to happen.

351
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:18,806
Speaker 0: Yeah once the rain starts coming down there's no going back.

352
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:28,410
Speaker 0: and also One interesting thing about this video is usually when you see videos tornadoes It's like the tornado is sort of like this opaque mass of dust, you know in a spiral, right?

353
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:31,750
Speaker 0: So usually when the tornado actually hits you can't see anything.

354
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,046
Speaker 0: You know, all you see is there and then you see the destruction afterwards.

355
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:39,854
Speaker 0: in this one The tornado doesn't seem to be like built up yet So it isn't.

356
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:42,283
Speaker 0: you can see the entire video.

357
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:48,989
Speaker 0: you can see everything perfectly clearly moving around and It's epic.

358
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:54,702
Speaker 1: Granted we're not gonna link to it But we were watching all these other videos of trains being subject to tornadoes.

359
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:58,654
Speaker 1: and there's this one where basically a train Surprising the trains.

360
00:24:58,755 --> 00:25:00,463
Speaker 0: it meet with tornadoes so often.

361
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:02,010
Speaker 1: either that or think about it.

362
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,480
Speaker 1: What are you doing when you're driving the train?

363
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,950
Speaker 1: You're not the one actually at the controls.

364
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,530
Speaker 1: You're just like an engineer hanging out in the back sitting there with your webcam.

365
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:18,464
Speaker 1: We're doing whatever but the video made it just for the fact that as the train is frantically backing up They passed this other train and the guys like hey, where are you going?

366
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:19,789
Speaker 1: The guys like I'm getting the hell out of here.

367
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:25,062
Speaker 0: Cuz you didn't see any destruction in that video, but you saw the guy.

368
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:26,789
Speaker 0: you heard the guy said I'm getting the hell out of here.

369
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,240
Speaker 1: Yep, so no strife.

370
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:34,063
Speaker 0: No gonads just His trains going backwards while there's a tornado out of the distance.

371
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:35,107
Speaker 1: I gotta point this out.

372
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:35,830
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna link to it.

373
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,493
Speaker 1: No thing of the day.

374
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:37,858
Speaker 1: I have a third thing of the day.

375
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:38,320
Speaker 1: No link.

376
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:40,007
Speaker 0: Good God save him for later.

377
00:25:40,891 --> 00:25:42,058
Speaker 1: No, I can't.

378
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,809
Speaker 1: the outrage is just boiling through.

379
00:25:44,453 --> 00:25:47,570
Speaker 1: Sears and Kmart put out the Christmas shit.

380
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:51,486
Speaker 1: Why just after the 4th of July they brought it out.

381
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:53,655
Speaker 1: your bullshit I'm not quote.

382
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:58,410
Speaker 1: Sears typically waits until November 1st to unveil its holiday merchandise, which is already bullshit.

383
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:01,362
Speaker 1: At least wait until after Thanksgiving.

384
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:02,065
Speaker 1: Good God.

385
00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:07,262
Speaker 0: Yep Halloween But still it's not even quote.

386
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:13,409
Speaker 1: but with the recession putting a crimp in spending The retailer is hoping to attract holiday shoppers early.

387
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:19,225
Speaker 0: They got Christmas trees and shit, they've got their Christmas stuff.

388
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:20,710
Speaker 0: Oh pigs or didn't happen?

389
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:22,584
Speaker 1: I'll find some pics.

390
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:33,049
Speaker 0: But anyway Still good God Alright, so today, you know people always seem to like the shows where it's all philosophies and intellects.

391
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:35,090
Speaker 1: you mean philosophical and intellectual.

392
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:37,192
Speaker 1: Notice.

393
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:38,295
Speaker 1: how is that intellectual?

394
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:40,100
Speaker 0: trying to not be those things?

395
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,708
Speaker 1: You're also trying to avoid actually bringing up the topic.

396
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:43,470
Speaker 0: god damn it.

397
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:51,870
Speaker 0: So We want to talk about immortality, but I don't know in what aspect you will discuss it.

398
00:26:51,890 --> 00:27:00,190
Speaker 0: You know because you read lots of things, you know in lots of entertainment media This topic always starts to come up like, you know, there'll be something like Galaxy Express 3 9.

399
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,650
Speaker 0: It should be like hey go get a robot body and live forever.

400
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:04,408
Speaker 0: But is that really something you want to do?

401
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,662
Speaker 0: You know is the is the beauty of life God or elves, you know?

402
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:16,520
Speaker 0: token ask elves, you know is life You know now meaningless because you live forever Burning wheel the way they set it up the races that are special.

403
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:19,370
Speaker 1: the elves eventually get too sad to deal with it anymore.

404
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:22,029
Speaker 1: The dwarves eventually get too greedy to deal with it anymore.

405
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:24,419
Speaker 1: The orcs get too hate-filled to do anything anymore.

406
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,379
Speaker 1: and humans live awesome lives and die when they're supposed to yep When they're supposed to right.

407
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:30,142
Speaker 0: and it's like.

408
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,589
Speaker 0: I'm sure that you know.

409
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:38,629
Speaker 0: Individual human beings like to live longer than the short time we have because clearly you can't accomplish everything in.

410
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:44,184
Speaker 0: you know Whatever limited time but Forever is perhaps too long.

411
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:53,434
Speaker 0: Maybe it's tricky You know is discussed often in many many books and movies and all sorts of things and I figure we can kill a show Talking about this.

412
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:53,736
Speaker 1: Yep.

413
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:54,017
Speaker 1: Now.

414
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,026
Speaker 1: I'm sure we could do more shows about this.

415
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:56,830
Speaker 1: detailed shows.

416
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,849
Speaker 1: There's like a Monday Tuesday Wednesday and like 10 Thursday shows about this.

417
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:06,110
Speaker 1: I mean the societal ramifications the economic ramifications, but I don't know we're just gonna kind of wing it from here.

418
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:07,808
Speaker 1: So are we talking about?

419
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:15,440
Speaker 1: Everlasting tuck immortality or I don't age past 22 immortality or Cyborg body immortality.

420
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,170
Speaker 0: I don't know of what everlasting tuck is.

421
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,690
Speaker 0: I assume it's a story of a guy who is everlasting.

422
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:27,595
Speaker 1: So everlasting talk is a story of family who is basically if you drink from the spring that you find somewhere You're immortal perfectly.

423
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:30,022
Speaker 1: There is no possible way to die.

424
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:31,887
Speaker 0: You are also invincible.

425
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:35,015
Speaker 1: You're invincible Immutable and immortal.

426
00:28:35,195 --> 00:28:37,582
Speaker 0: so even if you get shot, you're not even gonna hurt.

427
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:40,650
Speaker 1: not you cannot in any way be harmed or die forever.

428
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:46,696
Speaker 1: So you can't win when you get sick when the earth explodes in the far future You're gonna be floating in space.

429
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,790
Speaker 1: You'll be cast out into space to drift into whatever you drift into.

430
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,994
Speaker 0: Well, see that's pretty horrible.

431
00:28:51,014 --> 00:28:53,280
Speaker 0: See that that's that's one thing that notice how.

432
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,427
Speaker 1: that is also the immortality in Phoenix.

433
00:28:55,988 --> 00:28:56,470
Speaker 0: That's true.

434
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,108
Speaker 1: Yes, no one gets that.

435
00:28:58,512 --> 00:29:00,890
Speaker 1: Well one person gets it and it sucks.

436
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:10,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, so that's an interesting kind of immortality because you got to realize, you know People only want to live as long as there are, you know new things to do.

437
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:20,777
Speaker 0: because no matter what you know I mean some people can deal with boredom better than others, right but with infinite time You're eventually gonna run out of new stuff.

438
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:27,370
Speaker 0: So unless the world can progress faster than you can do things, you know You're all set.

439
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:39,830
Speaker 0: So right now Right, you know the year that we're living in is a good time to be immortal because people are creating arts and entertainments and technologies Faster than a human being who is not, you know modified in any way.

440
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:45,556
Speaker 1: I mean more can consume them more media is created in a year Then porn is filmed in.

441
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:49,126
Speaker 0: more than 24 hours of porn is filmed every 24 hours.

442
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,250
Speaker 1: Never mind the porn?

443
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:52,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and that's just the porn, right?

444
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,285
Speaker 0: So that doesn't include the books and the movies and the Internet's and right.

445
00:29:56,646 --> 00:30:04,406
Speaker 0: so, you know it's a good time to be immortal now, but if Say it was caveman times be a very bad time to be immortal.

446
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:05,250
Speaker 0: and if you you know.

447
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:18,418
Speaker 1: But then at the same time if you're immortal, maybe you'll become some sort of Steppenwolf but at the same time you might you'll be the one who has the multi-generational perspective and you will basically become the The like Emperor God of all.

448
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:18,799
Speaker 1: Yes,

449
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,439
Speaker 0: but eventually be bored being Emperor God and you'll want to be hobo Because

450
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:30,049
Speaker 1: by being Emperor God you can then Elevate society around you in the exact perfect image of what you want it to be

451
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:34,590
Speaker 0: But eventually getting what you want will be bored and you have to get what you don't want.

452
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:38,399
Speaker 0: Yeah well You know you can't get what you don't want because you're a devil.

453
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,690
Speaker 1: who have described this that sort of immortality in literature?

454
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,710
Speaker 1: I think our Scott Bakker has put it the in the best says Swatha never shits.

455
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,949
Speaker 0: You're immortal, you know how much you can have to shit.

456
00:30:54,872 --> 00:31:02,776
Speaker 1: So a lot of shitting going on as well at the never shits was more an example of a moment when I put down a book And laughed out loud.

457
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:04,481
Speaker 0: I laughed mightily.

458
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,547
Speaker 1: money knows the non men.

459
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:16,197
Speaker 1: I Remember the fact that they're destroyed solely by the fact that they have been given Immortality the fact that they live forever.

460
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:18,061
Speaker 1: They can be killed by other things, but they are.

461
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:23,268
Speaker 1: They can live so long.

462
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:44,510
Speaker 1: Eventually, they've experienced everything the world has to offer and they they end up kind of being forced to either seek out painful surprising Horrifying events simply so that there is something interesting something novel something to remember Or else they lose themselves because they've seen everything and everything kind of blends together.

463
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:56,325
Speaker 0: Yeah that's why you know the kind of immortal where you can end it when you want to end it is a good kind because then You can do as much as you want and if you feel like, you know Well, it's gonna take a real long time before anything new happens.

464
00:31:56,526 --> 00:32:01,010
Speaker 0: or oh shit I'm floating in space and I can't move because we didn't invent rocket ships.

465
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,173
Speaker 0: But I just ended.

466
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:14,629
Speaker 1: as Scott Johnson always says if you would ever want to end it if you could ever conceive of being bored You don't deserve immortality because you clearly have not attained the level of sentience required to appreciate it.

467
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:18,663
Speaker 0: Well, you know that that's true in some has the same thing.

468
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,750
Speaker 1: how well can you handle boredom Tetsuro?

469
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know.

470
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:27,050
Speaker 0: in some ways though, I mean, you know, it's just the fact of of the universe we live in, right?

471
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,209
Speaker 0: It's like we happen to live in this universe.

472
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:35,003
Speaker 0: Yes, and this universe while it is very very vast, right?

473
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,370
Speaker 0: It is not perhaps infinitely vast.

474
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:52,770
Speaker 0: Well, as far as we can tell and quantum this And you know while you could say for us say sit on a planet and watch life evolve Eventually, you're gonna do that three or four times, you know and see life evolve.

475
00:32:52,911 --> 00:33:01,890
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like huh, you know you and then you know The universe that we live in also at least from what we can tell right now appears to be very repetitive.

476
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:02,905
Speaker 0: You know with.

477
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:10,349
Speaker 0: you know You look and an atom has electrons going around it and a plasma star has planets going around The galaxy of stars.

478
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:20,410
Speaker 1: Look at the the the Phoenix idea that Infinite time you are eventually going to be able to create things with which you can transcend the world.

479
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:34,942
Speaker 1: Perhaps I mean given infinite time you will theoretically if the quantum theory of you know divergence that every possible event every possibility spawns off in other universes forever is Then you could experience anything that could ever exist ever.

480
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:36,909
Speaker 1: and there's an infinite number of those things.

481
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:40,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that assumes that there are other universes to get to.

482
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:42,480
Speaker 0: you know Let's say you discover all the science.

483
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,223
Speaker 0: There is a discovery.

484
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:44,590
Speaker 0: you have the perfect, you know.

485
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,094
Speaker 0: You completely understand.

486
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:53,869
Speaker 0: you you achieve through your immortality and you know your quest for knowledge you use As a result achieve omniscience.

487
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:55,575
Speaker 0: There's nothing more to know.

488
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:59,990
Speaker 1: but that comes down to the fundamental question is the universe discrete or not?

489
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,179
Speaker 1: Are there fundamental units or not?

490
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:09,527
Speaker 0: But let's say you at you know one way or the other Yeah, you find out what the answer is whether it's a or B. then what are you gonna do?

491
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,928
Speaker 0: That's Yeah, so, you know there is.

492
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:26,108
Speaker 0: You know from what it looks like through the current situation of our universe as we can see it in laws of physics It looks like there is a dead end in our universe at which point they would be not much new.

493
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:35,409
Speaker 0: However You know I guess there I could imagine a universe in which there would be Infinite things to do and immortality would be very very desirable.

494
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:44,297
Speaker 1: But even then if supposing that I get to a point I am immortal and I am immutable and I am invulnerable So I cannot die.

495
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:45,880
Speaker 1: I cannot end my consciousness.

496
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:48,108
Speaker 1: It is absolutely impossible for me to end it.

497
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,002
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm And there's nothing left to do.

498
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:52,053
Speaker 0: You're gonna go crazy.

499
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,978
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe what happens?

500
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,467
Speaker 1: I mean, what could what sucks it?

501
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,068
Speaker 1: maybe?

502
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:07,933
Speaker 0: but at that time What happens with a self reflexive able to learn Conscious intelligence, you know what would really help that situation be omnipotence because you know I mean obviously they were.

503
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:12,148
Speaker 0: you know, if you're omnipotent you could just create things that would interest you.

504
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:16,130
Speaker 0: you could you know You could imagine, you know the universe that I can imagine that would be infinitely entertaining.

505
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:17,581
Speaker 0: I could just create it and go live in it.

506
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:17,783
Speaker 0: now

507
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:26,090
Speaker 1: Scott before we go any further I just want to point out the fact that you have not seen the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Really takes a lot out of this conversation

508
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:27,033
Speaker 0: Because that's

509
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:28,759
Speaker 1: what this show is about in some ways,

510
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:29,542
Speaker 0: uh-huh

511
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:31,448
Speaker 1: that show is not about what you think it's about.

512
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,895
Speaker 0: not It's not about dancing.

513
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:34,342
Speaker 1: Well, it is about dance.

514
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:34,784
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

515
00:35:34,804 --> 00:35:35,588
Speaker 0: Well, I still want to watch it.

516
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:37,277
Speaker 0: then It wasn't about see.

517
00:35:37,297 --> 00:35:39,630
Speaker 0: I thought it was about dancing, which is why I was gonna watch it someday.

518
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:41,970
Speaker 0: But I if you were just telling me it wasn't about dancing.

519
00:35:42,111 --> 00:35:49,709
Speaker 1: I'm pulling the bottle where I keep bringing up quotes But I can't quote or reference Haruhi like I can our Scott backer because you have not experienced it.

520
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:55,770
Speaker 1: First even our Scott backer you didn't get to the point of I remember the slaughter of children.

521
00:35:56,263 --> 00:36:04,444
Speaker 1: No Cuz I don't remember the slaughter because the fact that he remembers the slaughter of children is one of the only threads he can cling To to remind himself that he still exists.

522
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,757
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Yeah, that's another thing.

523
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,890
Speaker 0: is the fragility of the human mind, right?

524
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:13,170
Speaker 0: Imagine if you were some sort of other thing like say you were an immortal rat, right?

525
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,216
Speaker 0: The rat has a much simpler mind.

526
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:17,183
Speaker 0: So his whole life, you know, even a live forever.

527
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:22,754
Speaker 0: He wouldn't have any qualms about it Like eat eat eat eat eat Stink sink eat eat eat.

528
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:26,644
Speaker 1: What if you are completely immutable not just in body but in mind?

529
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,770
Speaker 0: like the you couldn't learn anything.

530
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,770
Speaker 1: You couldn't forget anything like the Terminator before they set him back to read write memory.

531
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:37,546
Speaker 0: Well, then it doesn't really matter cuz you're just you're not even gonna know that you're immortal.

532
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,475
Speaker 0: You're like a goldfish You're not remembering anything.

533
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:41,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it does just.

534
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:42,228
Speaker 0: you might as well just be a robot.

535
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,878
Speaker 1: then What about the interesting situation of I?

536
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,328
Speaker 1: can I transcend by changing?

537
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,970
Speaker 1: Can I find ways to transcend with technology?

538
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:58,502
Speaker 1: my own mental limitations such that maybe I can force myself to forget and Thus be able to be reborn and experience everything all over.

539
00:36:58,543 --> 00:37:07,770
Speaker 1: but that's no different than killing yourself Yes, but it is a way to effectively end your consciousness and kill yourself while still being permanently immortal and immutable.

540
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:15,590
Speaker 0: Well only your body will be immortal but you know that your body isn't the important part, you know The consciousness is the important part.

541
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:22,350
Speaker 0: So really being immortal is not a problem of body even though bodies are the reason you are not immortal.

542
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:27,208
Speaker 0: It's about maintaining your you know, your ego or whatever, you know.

543
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:29,056
Speaker 1: Well, that's the other really.

544
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:31,766
Speaker 1: maybe we take this from a completely different perspective.

545
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:32,690
Speaker 1: What about the pure?

546
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,836
Speaker 1: Philosophical perspective though.

547
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,669
Speaker 1: I noticed I was talking to Emily about this a while ago.

548
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:40,082
Speaker 1: I was talking about to a bunch of people about this independently.

549
00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:43,916
Speaker 1: There are many Philosophical kind of lenses.

550
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:59,367
Speaker 1: there are many philosophical perspectives and any idea any situation any philosophy any world any view anything can be Explained and described and debated from any number of philosophical perspectives and I've noticed that for the past decade or so.

551
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:07,835
Speaker 1: I Have always fallen back on the perspective of solipsism because it's kind of the situation where you can make any Circuit with Nand gates.

552
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:11,490
Speaker 1: so I only use Nand gates and I can still make any circuit.

553
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:16,150
Speaker 1: But at the same time what it maybe would be more interesting if I used ors and nots as well.

554
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:19,890
Speaker 0: It would be more interesting and be less efficient and it would achieve the same result.

555
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,562
Speaker 1: But as a result, I tend to always fall back on solipsism.

556
00:38:22,622 --> 00:38:24,209
Speaker 0: and what's wrong with solipsism?

557
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:37,170
Speaker 1: Well immortality from my pragmatic solipsistic worldview comes down to the fact that I have to assume that my consciousness is immortal because I've never Experienced a world where my consciousness did not exist.

558
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,844
Speaker 1: I cannot conceive of a world where my consciousness does not exist.

559
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:50,747
Speaker 1: That is not purely a pragmatic I don't know projection and I cannot conceive truly of a way to end my consciousness.

560
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:51,469
Speaker 1: That is absolute.

561
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:57,529
Speaker 0: Well, I think the thing That's a little bit ridiculous.

562
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:04,210
Speaker 1: No, because the final point is that even if my consciousness were to be ended there is no way I could know.

563
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:09,389
Speaker 1: So there is no point in conceiving of the end of my consciousness because I could not ever experience it.

564
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,909
Speaker 0: You experienced right before the end of it.

565
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:20,954
Speaker 1: Do you really though because you were as long as you were conscious you are still conscious the the edge you're less conscious But are there?

566
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:21,777
Speaker 1: are there lines?

567
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:25,190
Speaker 1: is there a point at which you are not a conscious being anymore?

568
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,637
Speaker 0: Well, I think about you go to sleep, right?

569
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:37,470
Speaker 1: Yes, but at the same time and it is a point in which you're sort of In between sleep but now quite a way not really because you're still conscious and self-reflective, but then you start to forget yourself.

570
00:39:37,873 --> 00:39:47,595
Speaker 1: but then there's the point at which you Wake up again, and that raises the interesting question of maybe we're not even Immortal between days.

571
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:58,430
Speaker 1: It's very likely that when I go to sleep or I'm knocked out or something The contiguous threat of my consciousness might very well die and a new one is booted the next morning.

572
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:11,770
Speaker 0: That's all very nice philosophies But I think that the the evidence stacks up quite against what evidence all the evidence of the world is from the external perspective that I cannot trust completely.

573
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:16,081
Speaker 0: Yes, you cannot trust completely but you could be 99.999% sure.

574
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:20,877
Speaker 0: you're basically saying There is this point.

575
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:22,664
Speaker 0: Oh one percent uncertainty.

576
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:23,929
Speaker 0: No, therefore that is it.

577
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:27,048
Speaker 1: That's not what I'm saying because remember I said pragmatic solipsism.

578
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:36,143
Speaker 1: pragmatic Solipsism is the idea that while I cannot know anything for sure except for the self-reflective nature of my own consciousness Which itself is filtered through itself.

579
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:42,568
Speaker 1: I can Accept the experiences I have pragmatically because they are reliable.

580
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,034
Speaker 1: They're consistent They're repeatable.

581
00:40:44,456 --> 00:40:47,717
Speaker 1: if they were not reliable and repeatable, for example one I'm in a dream.

582
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:56,550
Speaker 1: when I'm in a dream Then I'm forced to fall back on solipsism further and drop some of the pragmatism because I can't reliably reproduce the experiences.

583
00:40:57,491 --> 00:41:01,068
Speaker 1: But the only thing that I know a hundred percent is that I exist.

584
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:11,241
Speaker 1: the only true proof that I have the only thing in the world that I can ever call upon without any reservation is the Fact that I can exist and reflect upon that existence.

585
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:19,930
Speaker 0: Yes, but you are 99.99% Sure that not only do you exist but you are a human being just like all these other human beings walk.

586
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:21,837
Speaker 1: That is 99 percent.

587
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:25,690
Speaker 1: The only thing I have that is 100% is that I have always existed.

588
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:31,204
Speaker 0: Yes, but if you choose to you know Discount the things that you are 99% sure then you might.

589
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:32,710
Speaker 0: you might as well just discount everything.

590
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:35,479
Speaker 1: Who said discount them pragmatic solipsism?

591
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:37,025
Speaker 1: I still react to the world.

592
00:41:37,145 --> 00:41:38,530
Speaker 1: I don't want my consciousness to end.

593
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,462
Speaker 0: I do not just because you don't want it doesn't mean you should believe.

594
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:42,345
Speaker 1: it's not gonna know.

595
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,510
Speaker 1: you're missing the point entirely.

596
00:41:44,052 --> 00:41:45,496
Speaker 1: It's gonna know you're missing.

597
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:46,178
Speaker 1: used to it Scott.

598
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,483
Speaker 1: You're missing the point entirely.

599
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:48,085
Speaker 1: You're like.

600
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,670
Speaker 1: you've absolutely missed the point here.

601
00:41:50,011 --> 00:41:50,574
Speaker 0: You're just me.

602
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:55,995
Speaker 0: you're making basically the same argument God people make which is like aha Yeah, you can't prove that.

603
00:41:56,076 --> 00:41:59,827
Speaker 0: I can't prove to myself a hundred percent that I'm gonna die.

604
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:00,910
Speaker 0: So I'm not gonna know.

605
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:02,134
Speaker 0: You're you.

606
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:02,919
Speaker 0: that's what you're saying.

607
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,610
Speaker 1: No, you've clearly missed the point of the argument.

608
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:17,027
Speaker 1: the point of the argument is that a Pragmatic solipsistic position on the world is that the consciousness will end when I die and that I should avoid death for as long as Possible and experience as many things as I can while I'm alive clearly.

609
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:20,016
Speaker 0: Yes So why were you talking before like?

610
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:25,530
Speaker 1: because because from a purely solipsistic perspective as opposed to the pragmatically?

611
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:37,609
Speaker 1: solipsistic percent perspective I cannot but assume that my consciousness is immortal because there is no possible way for me to in any way Become aware of the end of said consciousness.

612
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:39,335
Speaker 0: mmm.

613
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:44,310
Speaker 1: But the problem is with all purely solipsistic arguments.

614
00:42:44,611 --> 00:42:50,053
Speaker 0: You know, I think because you sleep and because you wake up after that sleep then you.

615
00:42:50,073 --> 00:43:00,207
Speaker 0: it must therefore be possible for Your consciousness to sleep and then sleep not sleep again awaken sleep it now.

616
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:01,090
Speaker 1: sleep is different.

617
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:04,004
Speaker 1: I've never experienced going to sleep and waking up again.

618
00:43:04,104 --> 00:43:05,310
Speaker 1: So and not waking up again?

619
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,782
Speaker 1: So what does it feel like to go to sleep and not wake up?

620
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:10,850
Speaker 0: the same as sleeping only without waking up?

621
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,376
Speaker 1: No, but every time I've gone to sleep.

622
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:13,982
Speaker 1: I've those are distinct events.

623
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:20,670
Speaker 1: They're not tied together No, but solipsistically the only thing I know is that I exist and that I've never stopped existing.

624
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:24,562
Speaker 0: You also know that you know you exist and you think.

625
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:31,483
Speaker 0: therefore you are but there are periods of time When you are unable to think and in fact, you don't but not or think anything.

626
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:33,890
Speaker 1: those times are never experienced.

627
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,339
Speaker 1: I cannot experience them.

628
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:36,768
Speaker 1: I don't know that they exist.

629
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,610
Speaker 0: You know that you know that the times where you are not experiencing things.

630
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:46,241
Speaker 1: No, I don't because I don't experience the time passing.

631
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:48,430
Speaker 1: you're forgetting Scott pure solipsism.

632
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,827
Speaker 0: Yes, even in pure solipsism, you know, it is possible for Scott not to be unable.

633
00:43:53,907 --> 00:44:05,707
Speaker 1: in pure solipsism You only know what specifically you experience and you don't experience the time when you aren't conscious The con the threat of consciousness stops abruptly but starts up again.

634
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:23,705
Speaker 0: and the only Temporality the only possible way I can say that time has passed are the pragmatic external time measures Because you can feel your own consciousness fading and you can feel your own inability to control it as you pass out to sleep.

635
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:32,276
Speaker 0: and therefore, you know that For at least some period of time your consciousness was you know out When you were sleeping because I'd won.

636
00:44:32,356 --> 00:44:52,550
Speaker 1: I can't prove that that time exists that there's any time passing at all any amount of time Between when I go to sleep and when I wake up and to you don't actually experience at least I don't the moment of falling Asleep, there's a point when I'm I'm conscious and then the next conscious Instance I have is either myself in a dream or myself waking up the next morning.

637
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,839
Speaker 1: It is completely contiguous with no gaps whatsoever.

638
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,738
Speaker 0: There is a very large gap as it fades Doesn't happen to me?

639
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:01,370
Speaker 0: and you don't fade out to sleep?

640
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:02,018
Speaker 1: No I'm.

641
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,857
Speaker 0: The threat of your brain just turns off like a light.

642
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:11,918
Speaker 1: the threat of consciousness is going and I'm trying to fall asleep and the next Moment of consciousness is either a dream or being awake.

643
00:45:12,299 --> 00:45:12,760
Speaker 0: Really?

644
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:17,579
Speaker 0: Yes, that's sort of fucked up because I sort of go I'm awake I'm a little less awake.

645
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:19,029
Speaker 0: I'm a little less awake.

646
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:37,307
Speaker 1: There are moments when I when I Half asleep or half awake where I cannot fully experience the pragmatic world around me to where I am Confused by sensations that come at me to where I'm outside of this world and only inside of my own solipsistic existence.

647
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,390
Speaker 1: solipsistic existence.

648
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:46,797
Speaker 1: but the threat of consciousness is fully aware and within that solipsistic existence at all times and I've never Experienced a point where it was not there.

649
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:54,104
Speaker 1: because just from the rules of logic I cannot because I could not experience it because what I experience is what I experienced.

650
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:55,830
Speaker 1: I cannot experience what I'm not experiencing.

651
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:02,287
Speaker 1: Therefore a solipsistically I cannot possibly conceive of myself not existing.

652
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:08,610
Speaker 1: but pragmatically I know that I'm going to die, but I can't conceive of myself not existing very easily, but I've never experienced it.

653
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:14,389
Speaker 1: I have experienced it I don't believe you or at least if you have your unique or maybe I'm unique.

654
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:21,069
Speaker 1: but Solipsistically I can only argue from what I have experienced and I have never experienced a point where my consciousness in any way faded.

655
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:30,122
Speaker 1: I Have experienced many times my conscious From the moment of sentience because I have no memories of any time before that point.

656
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:32,367
Speaker 1: until now it is contiguous and unbroken.

657
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:35,076
Speaker 0: I Have many, you know, plus I also have.

658
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:38,630
Speaker 0: you know, there are many gaps in my in my memory.

659
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:41,330
Speaker 1: I have gaps in memory but not gaps in consciousness.

660
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:49,090
Speaker 0: I have gaps in consciousness when I'm sleeping when when I was young Well, there would be you know when I got my wisdom teeth out.

661
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:52,600
Speaker 1: Oh, the only gaps I have are pragmatic gaps not solipsistic gaps.

662
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:54,806
Speaker 0: I have solipsistic gaps.

663
00:46:55,268 --> 00:47:03,260
Speaker 1: I don't and I Hesitate to think that you do and I think that maybe you're misinterpreting them or maybe I don't see solipsistically You don't even exist.

664
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:03,808
Speaker 0: So what does it matter?

665
00:47:04,991 --> 00:47:21,478
Speaker 1: But no even when I got my wisdom teeth out I remember very clearly that I put the mask on and they said breathe deeply and I breathe in and the Absolute next moments that I experience consciously is sitting on the couch in my house With no in.

666
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,830
Speaker 1: there is no transition of any kind.

667
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:36,689
Speaker 1: And every time I go to sleep is like that except that sometimes the threat of consciousness resumes in the real world again in the pragmatic world and sometimes it resumes in the Pseudo-pragmatic dream world.

668
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:39,094
Speaker 0: Well, I can.

669
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:46,642
Speaker 0: I have experienced, you know being asleep and it fades out very gradually Back in.

670
00:47:46,802 --> 00:47:51,850
Speaker 1: I have not and solipsistically I cannot conceive of myself ceasing to exist.

671
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:59,857
Speaker 0: Well, that's you but I can very much can see myself ceasing to exist pragmatically though I can radically and solipsistically.

672
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,667
Speaker 1: I know I you know, I know what death will probably feel like.

673
00:48:02,748 --> 00:48:03,270
Speaker 1: I expect it.

674
00:48:04,437 --> 00:48:11,310
Speaker 1: I don't necessarily look forward to it But I look forward to it in a way that all act all true academics look forward to any novel experience.

675
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:16,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you know that that's one of my you know more fundamental philosophies.

676
00:48:16,175 --> 00:48:26,987
Speaker 0: is that death and many other things like current tattoo technology or Other such things, you know scarring are somewhat or very much irreversible.

677
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:30,809
Speaker 0: and you know Well, I want to experience many many things in life.

678
00:48:31,773 --> 00:48:38,526
Speaker 0: I tend to you know Stave off the irreversible experiences for the end or towards the end because you don't want to do something.

679
00:48:38,566 --> 00:48:41,315
Speaker 0: You can't undo You've seen it.

680
00:48:41,778 --> 00:48:43,488
Speaker 0: You can't unsee it.

681
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,516
Speaker 0: Yep, so I don't look at.

682
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,424
Speaker 0: go see, you know till you're old cuz you can't.

683
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:48,608
Speaker 0: you can't unsee it.

684
00:48:49,452 --> 00:48:51,662
Speaker 1: Well, I have seen two girls one cup you have not.

685
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:53,089
Speaker 0: I will save that.

686
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:58,948
Speaker 0: also Till after I get some sort of you know tattoo that I can digitally modify so I don't have to.

687
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:00,134
Speaker 0: you know It won't sag.

688
00:49:00,214 --> 00:49:02,466
Speaker 1: Wait, wait - so are you gonna get a tattoo of goat?

689
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:02,969
Speaker 1: see what's this?

690
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:08,230
Speaker 0: No that those are unrelated topics.

691
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:12,390
Speaker 1: So anyway, I don't know if we want to even get into the societal impact.

692
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:13,256
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it's.

693
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,230
Speaker 0: you know, a lot of it is is pretty simple.

694
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:19,270
Speaker 0: You know if people live longer and we keep making new people that's trouble.

695
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:25,550
Speaker 0: But at the same time if we live if people are healthy, there'll be less health care costs, but there'll be other costs.

696
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:27,436
Speaker 1: We have biological immortality.

697
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:36,230
Speaker 1: because I very much a number of people have brought this idea to the forefront and There's a surprising amount of resistance to the idea and not for the reasons you'd expect.

698
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:46,730
Speaker 1: It's mostly like groups like the AARP and the elderly Kind of fighting against this for re for reasons other than it would mess us up economically and socially.

699
00:49:47,574 --> 00:50:03,449
Speaker 1: But I like the idea of treating aging Beyond your peak age, you're like 21 22 like the peak physical age but treating all of the degeneration that happens after that point as a curable disease and putting resources toward curing it.

700
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:14,850
Speaker 1: and the idea that no one should ever be subjected to their hair thinning or Losing their voice or losing their eyesight or losing their muscle mass or osteoporosis or any of the things that come with age.

701
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:16,498
Speaker 1: And then why don't we?

702
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:23,700
Speaker 0: it's nice and you think of it on an individual level But it's not so nice and you think of it on a you know Global level given the other realities of the world.

703
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:31,469
Speaker 0: if you solve that problem without solving other problems You just make all those other problems worse and we're probably overall be worse off than we are now.

704
00:50:32,215 --> 00:50:33,344
Speaker 1: See the thing is I don't care.

705
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:34,030
Speaker 1: I say go for it.

706
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,009
Speaker 0: Anyway, you've also got to look at the fact that you know old people.

707
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:43,950
Speaker 0: You know, even if they didn't have these other problems of you know, becoming old in body, you know, they're old in mind.

708
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:49,161
Speaker 0: They actually tend to cause a lot of the problems in our society just because you know They're so old-fashioned and they don't.

709
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:50,650
Speaker 0: but Scott don't like change.

710
00:50:50,671 --> 00:50:52,193
Speaker 1: then again Look at we.

711
00:50:52,213 --> 00:50:58,054
Speaker 1: there's research that some of the reason why people learn more slowly in old age has to do with changes in the Brain and that sort of thing.

712
00:50:58,074 --> 00:51:06,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, but people also don't like change people, you know, even young people, you know It gets like 40 and they still like the same stuff from when they were, you know 20 or whatever.

713
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:11,199
Speaker 1: at the same time you would have people who have Multigenerational perspectives and you have people.

714
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:16,094
Speaker 1: you could have humans who could plan for and complete Thousand year project.

715
00:51:16,194 --> 00:51:17,397
Speaker 0: that would be very good.

716
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:27,130
Speaker 1: But you know, it's a balanced thing, you know, basically it would force humanity as a Whole to to reach out to the stars to find novelty and experience.

717
00:51:27,491 --> 00:51:39,930
Speaker 0: But I also you know while you would have those great things of the incredibly incredibly old people doing amazing amazing stuff I think you would also have a problem of sort of a tyranny of the incredibly old people over the incredibly new people.

718
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:45,409
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely You would have this very static society where there are people who've lived so long that nothing you do will ever surprise them.

719
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:48,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically you would create a bunch of itchy Jimas.

720
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:56,750
Speaker 1: Oh shit And that would be bad unless We don't get into the Hyperion situation.

721
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:00,602
Speaker 1: What if we achieve perfect biological immortality?

722
00:52:01,183 --> 00:52:03,250
Speaker 1: not even the immutability and not?

723
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:09,026
Speaker 1: necessarily Invulnerability, but just you know, everyone hits 22 and never ages past that point.

724
00:52:09,347 --> 00:52:11,389
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm People can still be killed.

725
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:17,150
Speaker 1: Yes, and we solve the problem of our brains might run out of capacity with some sort of ghost-in-the-shell external memory system.

726
00:52:17,951 --> 00:52:20,784
Speaker 0: Well, you that goes in the shell technology stuff.

727
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,950
Speaker 0: That's a whole separate issue.

728
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,590
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean look at the idea of external memory gets to the point to where what if I?

729
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,176
Speaker 1: Access someone else's memories in their entirety.

730
00:52:28,577 --> 00:52:31,306
Speaker 1: Am I not now simply them plus my own experiences.

731
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,570
Speaker 1: So, how are they special?

732
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,647
Speaker 1: Why should they even bother to continue exist singularity?

733
00:52:35,728 --> 00:52:43,190
Speaker 1: Yes the way to avoid singularity is Differentiation and differentiation will happen if we never have teleportation.

734
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:46,810
Speaker 1: Because then all right humanity goes out to the stars.

735
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:53,530
Speaker 1: Planets will stagnate because people on them will be the old who have been there forever and have seen everything.

736
00:52:54,174 --> 00:53:04,843
Speaker 1: But groups of people will travel out millions of years out doing things and Their experience will diverge wildly like the ouster's did because remember the ouster's couldn't teleport.

737
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:07,070
Speaker 0: you're assuming everyone listening to show read that book.

738
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:08,489
Speaker 1: I don't care.

739
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:21,630
Speaker 1: so let's say groups of people go out and have multi-thousand ten thousand hundred thousand million year Experiences where they're so far away that they diverge radically culturally and experientially.

740
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:23,478
Speaker 0: Well, I mean this goes back to what I said in the beginning.

741
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:27,023
Speaker 0: right if you're assuming the universe that we live in is the Universe right?

742
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:27,751
Speaker 0: then yes Will it.

743
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,902
Speaker 0: mortality is kind of bled because there's a lot of repetition and things.

744
00:53:31,363 --> 00:53:33,350
Speaker 0: laws of physics are limiting even this situation.

745
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:39,690
Speaker 1: We will eventually theoretically have completely filled the universe in which case the last question comes up and all those sorts of right.

746
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:53,970
Speaker 0: but but if you can you know the one of the realities of our universe is that it takes a long time to get anywhere because the limit to speed and Things are far apart and that you know that law of physics in our universe will create differentiation even if people are immortal.

747
00:53:54,460 --> 00:54:06,050
Speaker 0: however Given some other universe where you could teleport and get places very quickly or things are very close to each other You could test or act or whatever the hell you want to call it right then that differentiation would disappear.

748
00:54:06,752 --> 00:54:07,535
Speaker 0: So it's you know it's.

749
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:12,940
Speaker 0: it's another matter of immortality would be a lot more awesome in a universe other than the one we live in right now.

750
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:30,410
Speaker 1: But just the idea that space and the lack of teleportation could force differentiation and you'd have these kind of long periods of nothing, but then radical change as The ouster's came back and had very different ideas about existence from you because they've been gone for two million years.

751
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:34,110
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot of sci-fi books about that of you know aliens come.

752
00:54:34,491 --> 00:54:42,630
Speaker 0: They're not actually aliens that the people who left earth and landed on planet who knows what a billion years ago And it took them a half a million years to get there and a half a million years to get back.

753
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,429
Speaker 1: You know maybe because we've gone on long enough at least for one show's worth.

754
00:54:47,192 --> 00:55:00,790
Speaker 1: maybe we should just list all of the media that have shaped our views of this because People if someone has watched and experienced and read all of the media that we're about to list they will probably We really have a much more interesting and direct conversation.

755
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:01,151
Speaker 1: I think

756
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:18,473
Speaker 0: one thing I do want to bring up before we end though all right back in the day when I was in the Jew high school youth group right the the international president of said youth group came And he you know he did some shtick right and his shtick was basically like you know hey some guy gives you a contract And you could.

757
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:28,730
Speaker 0: you know these are the terms and it'll make you immortal with all these conditions and such and such right and He's basically I think it was something along the lines of you won't die until the Sun explodes yada yada yada.

758
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:45,288
Speaker 0: But anyway, he made this point which you know while it was sort of a point there was something to it And he basically was like hey if you would go and get someone to join this organization right then you will be immortal because you have this effect on it right.

759
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:52,354
Speaker 0: and You know even though it was sort of just a pitch to get everyone to go out and get people to you know get others To sign up right.

760
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:53,898
Speaker 0: it's sort of true.

761
00:55:53,938 --> 00:56:01,759
Speaker 0: and that even if you die and you you know your you know consciousness No longer exists And you can have no continuing effect on the universe.

762
00:56:02,522 --> 00:56:20,865
Speaker 0: if you have an effect while you are here And you believe that the universe continues to exist even without you which is most likely true Then you know you should just think of it as if you can just do stuff while you're here You're in some way effectively immortal you know.

763
00:56:20,885 --> 00:56:26,510
Speaker 0: think about Michael Jackson You know more is going on because he died even though he can't do anything.

764
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,221
Speaker 0: He already did stuff.

765
00:56:28,242 --> 00:56:34,770
Speaker 0: that's so in a way He's still alive, and he will continue to be alive for probably centuries.

766
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:39,083
Speaker 0: I mean Elvis and the Beatles and Beethoven and Mozart and da Vinci and who knows who?

767
00:56:39,324 --> 00:56:42,636
Speaker 0: he was already had effects on Society for centuries.

768
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:46,974
Speaker 1: he was definitely big enough to where he will outlast Everyone on earth.

769
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:52,210
Speaker 0: times at least 30 or 40 yeah, so you know you think about these people from ancient times.

770
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,481
Speaker 0: You know Hammurabi right?

771
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:57,666
Speaker 0: He's that's you know Is still around right?

772
00:56:57,787 --> 00:57:16,281
Speaker 0: so Barring immortality of the literal kind where you will never actually die we should strive for effective Immortality where your effect on the universe you know that is at least remembered and is able to be recognized is Continues to exist.

773
00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:25,567
Speaker 0: cuz I mean I'm sure Everyone you know if you believe the butterfly of flaps his wings just by being born you have an infinite effect on the future Of the universe and some effect on atoms.

774
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:29,900
Speaker 1: or grab The problem you have an infinite, but undirected effect exactly you should.

775
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:39,566
Speaker 0: you need a directed, and you know some effect on the universe that can actually be pointed out and be associated with your consciousness.

776
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:47,655
Speaker 0: that was directed and Intentional and you know you'll make your mark on Things forever, and that is the key.

777
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:50,279
Speaker 1: look ye mighty upon my works.

778
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:56,818
Speaker 0: Yep God Looking mighty upon our episodes of geek nights.

779
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,643
Speaker 0: may hard drives always exist.

780
00:57:59,365 --> 00:58:12,023
Speaker 0: so that aside Galaxy Express 3 9 My tell legend Queen millennia pretty much all Anything where people are getting robot bodies goes in the shell.

781
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:19,776
Speaker 1: yeah along those lines The prince of nothing series just for the non men yep And go got her off and all that.

782
00:58:19,816 --> 00:58:28,466
Speaker 1: obviously anything involving token elves hyperion Sanctuary if you want to read about old people tyranny yeah, but that's not doesn't have immortality.

783
00:58:28,526 --> 00:58:29,630
Speaker 1: no, but it has itchy-jima.

784
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:34,963
Speaker 0: Yeah There's actually some episodes of the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon not the ABC one.

785
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:36,628
Speaker 0: the one the one that rim doesn't like.

786
00:58:36,669 --> 00:58:47,190
Speaker 0: the sort of One with the bad animation where Dr.. Robotnik got some chaos emeralds they gave him like immortality and invincibility and who knows what those are relevant.

787
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:54,347
Speaker 1: I'm the only one in the world who remembers those Never mind obvious philosophical text that I don't even need to list.

788
00:58:54,668 --> 00:58:56,074
Speaker 0: yeah It's like.

789
00:58:56,094 --> 00:58:56,819
Speaker 0: there's so many.

790
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,973
Speaker 0: It's like I know there's so many I can't.

791
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,644
Speaker 0: it's like when I'm actually pressured to think of them like they don't come up.

792
00:59:01,765 --> 00:59:03,010
Speaker 0: you can read everlasting talk.

793
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:04,354
Speaker 1: I read it in like fourth grade.

794
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:05,598
Speaker 1: I don't remember much about it.

795
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:15,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see stuff where someone lives forever Some people.

796
00:59:18,702 --> 00:59:22,340
Speaker 1: Last question yeah, yeah that kind of covers the physics side.

797
00:59:23,782 --> 00:59:25,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm done with the show.

798
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:27,238
Speaker 1: the show will not live forever.

799
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:27,720
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

800
