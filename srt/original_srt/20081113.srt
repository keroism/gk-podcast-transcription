Speaker 0: Let's do this Stayed home today Went to work I'm gonna stay home tomorrow too, and I don't even have to use days or anything.

6
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,040
Speaker 1: see I actually have too many days.

7
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,162
Speaker 1: I got to figure out exactly which days I'm taking.

8
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:44,584
Speaker 1: I'm.

9
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:51,317
Speaker 1: I think I really think I'm gonna take off like every Wednesday in December and then like the last two weeks of the month.

10
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,339
Speaker 0: yeah I guess like this of this work that I'm I need to do that needs to get done pretty soon.

11
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:57,644
Speaker 1: I'm in that boat.

12
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:59,832
Speaker 1: I'm behind on every project.

13
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,297
Speaker 0: I had I should probably do.

14
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,020
Speaker 0: It's just one work.

15
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:07,600
Speaker 0: It's not a bunch of projects one thing I'm supposed to do but and they're like yeah, you know you can work on it from home.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,884
Speaker 0: You got the VPN working right.

17
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,436
Speaker 1: ah you know what I've actually been working from home a lot lately.

18
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:13,680
Speaker 1: because it's like I'm at work.

19
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:32,179
Speaker 1: Alright I can either go home on the 410 train And then if I have another hour work to do I can just do it at home in the comfort of my house in My Aeron chair with food and drink and music and I can be mostly naked Or I can stay at work take a crappy crowded train home get stuck in traffic on my way back.

20
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just not gonna do it until Monday.

21
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:41,225
Speaker 0: I'm gonna instead do what I did today, which is spend most of the day working on geek night shit Website and such.

22
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,108
Speaker 1: see I don't.

23
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:46,939
Speaker 1: actually I really don't feel that I've been working a lot of extra hours this week But I don't well actually for the last like month.

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:59,966
Speaker 1: But I don't feel bad about it because I still work fewer hours than a lot of other people Not just in my company But just in general like people seems like a lot of people we know will put in a lot of overtime with no real benefit.

25
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:00,813
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't know why.

26
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:09,683
Speaker 1: I mean if it's a choice between Do the overtime or you lose your job, and you're not in a place where you can easily get another job quickly well I mean this.

27
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,759
Speaker 0: the thing is there's a lot of people out there right who?

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,460
Speaker 0: Actually get paid hourly and make overtime money in those people if they've got nothing better to do.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:41,097
Speaker 0: You know if they're just gonna go home and play NS Or if they're just gonna go home, and you know play World of Warcraft or something I mean think about this if you work two hours of overtime Even if because of that you have to eat dinner like you know at a restaurant or a takeout place instead of eating dinner At home you still make enough money to make back that.

30
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,932
Speaker 0: and Unless you're doing something after work.

31
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,560
Speaker 0: You're not really losing anything.

32
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:54,272
Speaker 1: But you're forgetting something because remember there was a time a time when we were in college a time When I often could not afford food.

33
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,160
Speaker 1: I could not afford food.

34
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:57,745
Speaker 1: I had a job.

35
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:07,898
Speaker 1: very often the the the manager would come out and say something to the effect of Hey if someone wants to go home right now they can and I would be the first one out the door.

36
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:19,620
Speaker 1: well The boss would say hey anyone wants him overtime And I'd be hell no and then I'd go home and realize that I didn't have any food or money to buy food.

37
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:28,337
Speaker 0: The thing is is that when in those in those times when you left work immediately it was summer in College and awesome.

38
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,510
Speaker 0: so the time you weren't spending at work was time of awesome.

39
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:38,609
Speaker 0: So I'm talking about someone who if they leave work is gonna go home to a family they hate or go home to a TV.

40
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:48,861
Speaker 1: No, I posit this to you if you're good if you're one of those people who's going home to the family you hate There is a far bigger problem in your life than working overtime.

41
00:03:48,881 --> 00:04:00,970
Speaker 0: This is true, but at least under overtime is understandable If you are that person if you are a salaried employee like ribbon I and Your pay doesn't change depending on how many hours you work.

42
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,402
Speaker 0: That's simply a matter of either work and get paid at work.

43
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,570
Speaker 1: and don't guess the critical part cuz that IBM.

44
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,355
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't gonna get promoted.

45
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:12,104
Speaker 1: just cuz the way IBM was nothing was gonna happen to me.

46
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:17,149
Speaker 1: good if I worked 60 hours or 10 Hours, so I just did my job and that was it the hospital.

47
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,536
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into how poorly managed they were but now My bone it.

48
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:27,202
Speaker 1: basically I'll probably just get a much bigger bonus because I've been working late And I kind of need that for a down payment on a house.

49
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,509
Speaker 1: So it's about the right time.

50
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:32,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, I my pay does not change based on how many hours I work.

51
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:38,332
Speaker 0: So I just work and I you know, I get all the work I need to get done on time and actually that's it You know.

52
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,643
Speaker 1: one cool thing about when I worked at that hospital is it?

53
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:52,556
Speaker 1: I was a salaried employee But I still logged my hours and the way they handled overtime Was that you had to work thirty seven and a half hours a week and that was really the only Requirement as far as like payroll.

54
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:56,110
Speaker 1: and all those people were concerned and a lot of people worked a lot of extra hours.

55
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,045
Speaker 1: A lot of them didn't log the hours because their bosses told him not to.

56
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,030
Speaker 1: but that's just cuz they were dumb.

57
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:06,290
Speaker 0: But I would log ever if there was our logging which never has been for me.

58
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,099
Speaker 1: I don't think it was the dumbest thing because they they do this.

59
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,544
Speaker 1: they'd like log.

60
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,470
Speaker 1: they'd work hours that they didn't log.

61
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:18,228
Speaker 1: But then their boss would let them take like a week off which was more vacation time than they'd get.

62
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,240
Speaker 1: just had to do it Like kind of secretly.

63
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:21,370
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how they were.

64
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:30,844
Speaker 1: Basically everyone in the company did all these like secret deals with their bosses to like hey Can I just work late tonight and then skip Monday and Tuesday?

65
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:31,808
Speaker 0: I wish I could do that.

66
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:32,510
Speaker 0: That'd be awesome.

67
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:33,808
Speaker 0: I'd go for that a lot.

68
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,483
Speaker 1: There were a few people who worked the four ten hour days a week.

69
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,490
Speaker 0: if I if I was a boss of people.

70
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:45,233
Speaker 0: Basically, I wouldn't care if people showed up at the office unless there was a meeting at the office They had to be at.

71
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,161
Speaker 0: I wouldn't care if people stayed home.

72
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:52,812
Speaker 0: All I would care is this is the work it needs to be done on this time and That's it.

73
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,401
Speaker 0: If that happens you can do whatever you want.

74
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,545
Speaker 1: many a lot of jobs.

75
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:56,685
Speaker 1: you.

76
00:05:56,725 --> 00:06:02,350
Speaker 1: there's concurrent work with other people So you really got to have people around at the same time or else the works not gonna get done.

77
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:12,576
Speaker 1: And if it's if you don't get the work done Do that because then you're leaving it All right, so you and me are on a project and we got to get it done and you're like, yeah Let's work all day Monday and finish it.

78
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 1: I'm like, fuck you.

79
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:16,470
Speaker 1: I'm working Friday and then we don't get anything done.

80
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,515
Speaker 1: We won't get fired great.

81
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that was our fault for being dumbass.

82
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:20,990
Speaker 0: isn't not working together?

83
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:25,304
Speaker 0: Nah, nah, but that way if some it would be apparent very very quickly.

84
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:31,890
Speaker 0: if someone was not capable of working You know freely and awesomely and if someone isn't that's not the kind of person I want working for me.

85
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:44,050
Speaker 0: Honestly, I kind of like having the schedule now at least just because I commute on the train People who needed to work together would use you know technology to schedule the times they needed to be together.

86
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,690
Speaker 1: No Because that member at college that never worked unless the professor set it up had no one ever worked together properly on things.

87
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:52,779
Speaker 0: Oh, we did.

88
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:53,949
Speaker 1: You're the only ones.

89
00:06:55,374 --> 00:07:03,966
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever in the history of my time at RIT had a meeting with a group for a class whereupon Everyone in the group showed up.

90
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,635
Speaker 1: I've never Once it happened.

91
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:18,525
Speaker 0: there have been groups that I have been in where there were people not showing up But at least one or two other people always showed up and I have had groups that were like the perfect best groups where everyone Showed up and was awesome all the time.

92
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,169
Speaker 0: Most of you I guess you know.

93
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:31,110
Speaker 0: But the best group actually was when I took the XML not the XML class the ad hoc networking class Because it was basically me a guy I was in a group with before who was awesome and two graduate students who were awesome.

94
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,990
Speaker 0: It was just four awesome people, you know, cuz I'm awesome.

95
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,733
Speaker 0: Also see the.

96
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:38,390
Speaker 1: I guess the problem I had in IT was that the one time I was in a really awesome group.

97
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:43,209
Speaker 1: Everyone was so awesome that no one wanted to do the work because it was boring work.

98
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,930
Speaker 0: Oh, see we you know, this is a high-level CS class of you know, hard awesome work.

99
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,462
Speaker 1: Yeah And that class only the last couple labs were high-level.

100
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:56,750
Speaker 1: the first couple labs were like Here is how to deal with like running cables through walls and cut and dry wall.

101
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,110
Speaker 0: This wasn't a. this is wasn't a situation of labs.

102
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,930
Speaker 0: This is a situation of the whole class is one project.

103
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:07,890
Speaker 0: You basically spend the entire quarter making it and every single week you have to present where you're at and such.

104
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:14,030
Speaker 0: So, you know, I basically did all the front heavy work and then went ah for the rest of the quarter.

105
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,736
Speaker 0: Well, everyone else did the top heavy.

106
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,463
Speaker 1: But anyway, you do make a good point.

107
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:19,290
Speaker 1: Remember those days?

108
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:23,603
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about days in those summers where we lived at RIT?

109
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,586
Speaker 1: We had nothing to do.

110
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:28,820
Speaker 1: No responsibilities You had like one like summer half.

111
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,501
Speaker 0: I had class I had the the the third But they basically be the calculus three.

112
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,095
Speaker 0: Yeah calculus three for the third time Three by three.

113
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I took calculus in high school.

114
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,810
Speaker 0: So when I got to RIT, they made me take calculus one two and three.

115
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,934
Speaker 0: So the calculus one.

116
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:51,210
Speaker 0: it was so laughably easy because I had already taken calculus in high school.

117
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,004
Speaker 0: That was like they give me problems like, you know derived the old way and I'm like, I already know You know annex to the n-1.

118
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:01,504
Speaker 0: I can't even my brain won't even do it the old way anymore because I know the new way.

119
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,010
Speaker 0: this isn't gonna happen.

120
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,748
Speaker 0: but I got like, you know an a and then it was calculus 2 which was like.

121
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,871
Speaker 0: But ti 89 was able to pull me through calculus 2 and then calculus 3.

122
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,589
Speaker 0: I just didn't understand what they were saying And I didn't understand what they were saying again.

123
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:28,055
Speaker 0: And then I took it in the summer and I got to see which was you know, good enough to graduate Outstanding and I got the same degree that someone who got much better grades got and probably a better.

124
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:34,750
Speaker 1: I at least had the requirement of if I didn't maintain a 3.4 one IBM would never have hired me because they required a 3.4.

125
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,730
Speaker 0: Well, I already yeah, I already knew that I did not care to work at any place.

126
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,170
Speaker 0: You know The only places that look at the GPA and stuff and actually cared are big companies.

127
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,251
Speaker 0: Like if I wanted to work at Intel, yeah But I.

128
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:50,830
Speaker 1: yeah, I only work at big companies because more and more I work in a company IT for small companies.

129
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,818
Speaker 1: It's not fun and doesn't pay.

130
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,543
Speaker 1: well and you it you're.

131
00:09:55,583 --> 00:10:00,157
Speaker 1: I mean if you're the IT guy for a small company They're not hiring more IT guys.

132
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:01,982
Speaker 1: You're it you're on call.

133
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,690
Speaker 1: You're the only one never go on vacation.

134
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,225
Speaker 0: I guess if I was it and it's I guess if I was IT I would like to work at the bigger company because that's what the big iron is.

135
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:12,696
Speaker 0: but being CS It's better to work at the small company.

136
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:23,236
Speaker 0: Everyone's just chillin chillin hanging out having a good time Relax, no big faceless, you know Policies and things getting in the way Just do it.

137
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,422
Speaker 0: However, it's supposed to be done.

138
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,834
Speaker 1: And yeah, I definitely agree Of course now I get.

139
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:32,278
Speaker 1: I get the benefits of both because there's only like a hundred people in my company But everything is run like it's a big company.

140
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:36,170
Speaker 1: So we still have all the like enterprise stuff, but there's only a hundred people.

141
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:37,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just bought and things are getting.

142
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:41,938
Speaker 0: you know, they're slowly getting weird but we're seeing how we can do.

143
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:50,668
Speaker 0: and you know, the boss who used to be you know, the Tech partner is now the New York tech manager and he's he's looking out for us.

144
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:51,130
Speaker 0: He's all good.

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,464
Speaker 0: So as long as we have the defenses up, well, we'll be alright.

146
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:59,444
Speaker 1: So anyway Tonight we decided you know, it's Thursday and remember way back.

147
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,770
Speaker 1: We said we were taking Thursday shows.

148
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,677
Speaker 1: We're just gonna change it up go crazy.

149
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:05,005
Speaker 1: We're gonna do all the cool weird stuff on Thursdays.

150
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:10,057
Speaker 1: We're gonna break format and Yeah, Thursdays ended up being two newses.

151
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:14,590
Speaker 1: We didn't care about and then a main bit that usually devolved into well what we just did.

152
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:28,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think you know, the problem is we just when you have a you know People talk about creativity, right and it's like when you have some sort of focus or limit on your creativity It's much easier to come up with something.

153
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:32,526
Speaker 0: For example, if someone says, you know come up with a cool video.

154
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:46,937
Speaker 0: It's like uh But if someone says come up with a funny video game video It's like huh, you can actually you have something to build off of it actually can think and I think Thursday in Thursday it was not a do.

155
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:51,530
Speaker 0: this Thursday was a. don't do tech don't do video games don't do anime don't do comic.

156
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,297
Speaker 0: So and don't do science.

157
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:58,916
Speaker 1: and I remember for the longest time it was either we did a food show Yeah, or we talked about a movie We just watch.

158
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:00,270
Speaker 0: so it's very very difficult.

159
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:08,173
Speaker 0: even when we decided to you know in throwing away the format of Thursday made it even harder to come up because now we even Have less direction.

160
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,317
Speaker 1: So we did.

161
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:13,089
Speaker 1: the best we could come up with is I think every Thursday.

162
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:13,711
Speaker 1: now This isn't.

163
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:14,053
Speaker 1: I mean.

164
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:20,029
Speaker 1: the reason we're not doing this stuff in the experimental feed is because the experimental feed is going to be reserved For the really out there stuff.

165
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:26,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically we came but we've always had a bajillion ideas the experimental feed and never done them because we don't have time for that.

166
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,573
Speaker 1: Shit, but we're getting there.

167
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:34,574
Speaker 1: I've actually got I've got several things recorded that eventually there's gonna be regular content in there and You know, I'm.

168
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:39,930
Speaker 0: as soon as this website is ready our ability to do more crazy shit will be greatly enhanced.

169
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,065
Speaker 1: But and shit just got real.

170
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:42,810
Speaker 0: it got real.

171
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,045
Speaker 0: You should see some of the features that are.

172
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:45,630
Speaker 0: at first.

173
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,610
Speaker 0: It's the website's pretty much just gonna just list the episodes and link to the mp3s and that sort of thing.

174
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,184
Speaker 0: But you'll see it's features will slowly grow on to it like a like a like barnacles.

175
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,490
Speaker 0: only good because barnacles are not so good.

176
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,298
Speaker 0: Sometimes they are are they really?

177
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:00,860
Speaker 0: Oh never.

178
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,030
Speaker 0: No, I mean even if you're a whale you want some armor.

179
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,423
Speaker 1: Probably not whale armor whale armor.

180
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, how about a giant whale?

181
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,213
Speaker 0: What do you?

182
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:11,718
Speaker 0: all whales are giant.

183
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,364
Speaker 1: now, I don't think you understand how giant.

184
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,697
Speaker 1: the one that went to the moon was very large Back down the map.

185
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:18,109
Speaker 0: It was how did he get there?

186
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,721
Speaker 1: It was bigger than the city on the map by far.

187
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,990
Speaker 1: It was like the size of four city squares.

188
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,782
Speaker 1: The big whale take it to the moon.

189
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not armor.

190
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,108
Speaker 0: You Need the paladin anyway.

191
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:39,901
Speaker 1: So we decided for now.

192
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:44,769
Speaker 0: what we're gonna do with Thursday is For now meaning for today and we'll see what happens.

193
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,018
Speaker 1: Well now for now in the general sense, there's two.

194
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,103
Speaker 1: there's two for now's.

195
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,950
Speaker 1: for now number one general sense.

196
00:13:50,553 --> 00:14:00,690
Speaker 1: Thursday we're going to try out formats of the show and Bits and all those things because we got a lot of bits that we never really incorporated into the show.

197
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:05,710
Speaker 0: We're still gonna talk about books too on Thursdays.

198
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:12,154
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, but pretty much I think the best way to go forward with Thursday is to Everything like we have.

199
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:24,215
Speaker 1: we can have a multitude of formats because right now geek night says the one format, you know news news thing of the day main vid Thursday can be a different format like every time to match the content of Whatever.

200
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,225
Speaker 1: we're talking about that.

201
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:34,201
Speaker 0: Thursday Yeah, and we'll probably steal things from other shows and try to remix them and combine them and some people might notice us stealing and Some people might not.

202
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:43,462
Speaker 0: and you know maybe we'll try to come up with new stuff and mix it with the stolen stuff and and formats that work will then be a retconned into Monday Tuesday Wednesday show.

203
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:44,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll try to party.

204
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,009
Speaker 0: We'll try to be like the Japanese steal ever steal everyone's ideas and then make them ten times better.

205
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:53,750
Speaker 1: Isn't the old strategy to steal from the Forgotten Masters exactly?

206
00:14:56,172 --> 00:15:04,050
Speaker 0: Gonna steal from someone steal from the Forgotten Masters Because then it appears as you're great as a master, but no one knows you're stealing.

207
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:14,514
Speaker 1: But anyway the for now of right now is whenever we can't come up with a topic for a Thursday Then what?

208
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:15,578
Speaker 1: basically these two things?

209
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:25,887
Speaker 1: if we can't come up with a format for a Thursday Then what we're gonna do is just like pick a topic and force it and if we can't come up with a topic We're gonna pick a format and force it.

210
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:28,720
Speaker 1: so tonight we couldn't come up with a topic.

211
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:35,443
Speaker 1: so we decided to force a format and The crab people I came up with was I'll have a topic.

212
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,627
Speaker 0: people know what crab people is.

213
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:37,290
Speaker 0: We keep saying it.

214
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,815
Speaker 1: I don't think we should tell them.

215
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,100
Speaker 1: All right, or should we?

216
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,108
Speaker 0: I know if you don't know what crab people is.

217
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,438
Speaker 1: You're not cool It's a crab people.

218
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:44,104
Speaker 1: It's now.

219
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:44,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

220
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:48,487
Speaker 1: All right So I guess you could have crab people II then it could be an adjective people.

221
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:52,787
Speaker 0: I people I multi-pass.

222
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:58,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, quite really Honestly, yeah, really?

223
00:15:59,195 --> 00:15:59,476
Speaker 1: Okay.

224
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:05,555
Speaker 1: Well, there were like nine jokes and okay anyway, so Scott's got a topic.

225
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,730
Speaker 1: I've got a topic and inadvertently we didn't tell each other what the topics are.

226
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:18,998
Speaker 1: So one if the topics end up being the same topic I don't know what we'll do because I can't imagine that being the case All right, but I don't know.

227
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,564
Speaker 1: should we flip a coin?

228
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,129
Speaker 1: I got a C a d6 over there.

229
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,634
Speaker 0: I rolled roll your d6.

230
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:26,442
Speaker 0: All right, I got evens means you go first.

231
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:27,586
Speaker 1: evens mean I go first.

232
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:27,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

233
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:28,729
Speaker 1: All right, here we go.

234
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:30,375
Speaker 0: You could be lying.

235
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:31,138
Speaker 1: It's a one.

236
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,383
Speaker 0: No, it's not good.

237
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,226
Speaker 0: I could roll again.

238
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:35,277
Speaker 0: I Don't know then.

239
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:40,362
Speaker 0: What's the point of even rolling if it's just We're not gonna obey the dice.

240
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,430
Speaker 0: what's the point of using it?

241
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:52,380
Speaker 1: That's always been the way I flip coins whenever I need to make a decision that I flip a coin for And I urge anyone who has to flip coins when you're not playing a German board game To use this method.

242
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,740
Speaker 1: I say with me you're not playing a German board game Because if you're playing a German board game, you're flipping a coin.

243
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,466
Speaker 1: It should actually be random.

244
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,173
Speaker 1: if it's not random Don't flip a coin.

245
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:13,929
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you're gonna flip a coin to figure out what to do flip the coin and if you immediately in any way balk at the result choose the Opposite answer from what you flipped and don't look back.

246
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:16,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz that means you know, it's like.

247
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:19,630
Speaker 0: it's like if you're flipping a coin It's because you don't know what you want.

248
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:29,957
Speaker 0: But if you flip the coin and you get a result and you feel like you don't want that like you're like I don't want to do what the coin said then do the other thing, you know Just don't then just do.

249
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:32,230
Speaker 0: the other thing is obviously you didn't like the one you got.

250
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,595
Speaker 0: Yes, but don't lie to yourself.

251
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,704
Speaker 1: Don't be angry with or for the coin.

252
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,050
Speaker 1: Just just go with the opposite.

253
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:43,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't have to do whatever the coin tells you to do As long as you promise to protect both children and coins.

254
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:44,753
Speaker 1: Okay.

255
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,801
Speaker 1: Okay enough of this cavalcade crap.

256
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:47,464
Speaker 1: Let's go.

257
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,870
Speaker 0: I guess they're barking and you're going first.

258
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,923
Speaker 1: Well, I assume you're not talking about Martin Martin Luther King jr.

259
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:55,365
Speaker 1: Estate.

260
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,717
Speaker 0: no, okay Is that what you're talking about?

261
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,946
Speaker 0: I'm talking about really?

262
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,832
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz it came up What.

263
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,560
Speaker 0: well, there's one thing I know about Martin Luther King jr.

264
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,125
Speaker 0: Estate and that is his wife.

265
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:18,483
Speaker 0: Coretta Scott King died Relatively recently like months maybe a year something to go due to Randy BS due to well do Well, yes, she had cancer and she could have easily.

266
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:21,454
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, there's no cure for cancer There's no magic.

267
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:36,910
Speaker 0: cancer goes away and you survive right but many many people Survive all types of cancer because they go and get chemotherapy and radiation therapy and all sorts of other Painful medicines in hospitals that she could have easily gotten just by going to a hospital.

268
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,770
Speaker 0: You know, she's Coretta Scott King Martin Luther King's wife.

269
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:40,795
Speaker 0: She could have gotten them.

270
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:41,600
Speaker 0: that do you know?

271
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,472
Speaker 0: she even if she didn't have the money which you know Obviously she had the money and she could have gotten the money easily Right.

272
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:53,749
Speaker 0: She could have been you know, good chance of survival not like a guarantee but good chance very good chance.

273
00:18:53,849 --> 00:19:05,038
Speaker 0: instead She decided to go to Mexico to see some Randy bullshit clinic not real medicine doctor and she died To no one's surprise.

274
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,990
Speaker 0: who knew that she was going to get fake medicine?

275
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not what I'm gonna talk about.

276
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:15,855
Speaker 0: Okay, because I guess if she hadn't done that with the question of the estate even be a question right now She'd probably still be alive.

277
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:19,170
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't the thing I'm gonna talk about.

278
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,269
Speaker 1: I don't think you know the the fullness of the state of the state of Martin Luther King.

279
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:24,349
Speaker 1: jr.

280
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:26,119
Speaker 0: I'd know I did not.

281
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,964
Speaker 0: I know nothing of this.

282
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:28,372
Speaker 0: I didn't even see it on Google News Really?

283
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:31,003
Speaker 1: This is one of those things is gonna make you really really angry.

284
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:34,281
Speaker 1: But anyway, because I rolled a one Alright, I guess you have to go first.

285
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:35,510
Speaker 0: Well, I know we're talking about.

286
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:38,036
Speaker 1: That was simply a preview.

287
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,684
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I was just gonna talk about how rim is stupid.

288
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,188
Speaker 1: All right, go for it.

289
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,178
Speaker 1: No, that's I'm waiting.

290
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:51,290
Speaker 0: No, I basically copped out and You know, I was gonna write a long post in the forum that I stopped earlier.

291
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,065
Speaker 0: So I said aha what an easy way to do that - what a way to foot.

292
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:56,972
Speaker 0: what an easy way to fill up The show.

293
00:19:56,992 --> 00:20:01,350
Speaker 1: Wait, did you write like a quarter of the post in the forum and then close the window or the tab?

294
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:07,990
Speaker 0: No, I did a okay cuz I don't like two paragraphs and then ctrl-a and pushback space and then close the tab.

295
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:12,798
Speaker 0: See, I usually close the tab when I balk But basically I just said hey, you know what?

296
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:14,464
Speaker 0: Uh, cuz that was so easy.

297
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:15,930
Speaker 0: I've already thought of two paragraphs.

298
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,123
Speaker 0: I'll save it for right now.

299
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:18,654
Speaker 0: What you know?

300
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:19,617
Speaker 0: nice cop-out.

301
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,850
Speaker 0: basically what I was gonna talk about is cuz you know, people were talking about this.

302
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:28,630
Speaker 0: You know, there was the regular old bailout of the the mortgage companies and the banks, right?

303
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:33,196
Speaker 0: And now they're talking about, you know bailing out the auto companies.

304
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:43,746
Speaker 1: and there was I in the state of California, which really you realize the state of California's Current deficit is now more than the GNP of more than a hundred countries.

305
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:48,810
Speaker 0: Whoa, and You know New York State actually just said, you know what?

306
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:57,490
Speaker 0: We're gonna have to cut back the spending because we don't have any money which is the first Thing I've seen about cutting back spending as opposed to you know, getting more fake money.

307
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:58,703
Speaker 1: First thing you do.

308
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:05,137
Speaker 0: Yeah Back the spending on education and Well, it depends.

309
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:07,970
Speaker 1: I mean you cut back spending unless that's not an option.

310
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:15,739
Speaker 1: I mean if your choice is either run at a deficit or stop sending kids to school You should probably run at the deficit.

311
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,419
Speaker 0: or you know, no, but yeah, but they're not not sending kids to school They're just make getting schools less money.

312
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:30,917
Speaker 1: So no new textbooks this year, you know, that sort of thing I went to like one of the richest schools in Michigan outside of the fancy boarding schools and we still had like Nine-year-old textbooks beating the hell out.

313
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:31,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

314
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:34,950
Speaker 0: I went to you know, relatively, you know, big-money high school.

315
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,950
Speaker 0: I mean it was in the wealthiest County in the wealthiest state in the entire in the wealthiest country in the world.

316
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:42,855
Speaker 0: You know wasn't the wealthiest town But it was a wealthy town.

317
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:54,210
Speaker 1: man talk about silver spoons because I went I lived in like the fourth or fifth Wealthiest suburb in the country and that's per capita though You know, they're like you can like places like Beverly Hills have mad monies.

318
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:58,068
Speaker 0: But then there's still like Monaco where there's also a lot really really low money.

319
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:03,687
Speaker 0: Yeah We'll have to compare the Fairfield County, Connecticut is just you know average big monies all around.

320
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:04,550
Speaker 0: no low monies.

321
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,101
Speaker 1: We'll have to compare the gross to the per capita.

322
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:09,230
Speaker 0: and then there's a small area in Westport, Connecticut.

323
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,695
Speaker 0: That's just huge monies.

324
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:11,457
Speaker 0: like famous people.

325
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:14,848
Speaker 1: I lived in the Mushroom Ring of Prosperity around the decaying center.

326
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:15,530
Speaker 1: That is Detroit.

327
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:25,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah But anyway, so the whole the main thing that's going on right now is the question of you know Bailing out the auto companies Ford GM mostly those two right.

328
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,950
Speaker 0: and the situation is this see these really big companies.

329
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:39,150
Speaker 0: right, the big companies are ran are run incredibly inefficiently are incredibly stupidly and They're losing money, you know, and they have cash right in their wallets.

330
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:46,943
Speaker 0: But their wallets are slowly emptying and in a certain number of months their wallets will be empty Unlike say Google or Microsoft who have giant wallets that are not emptying.

331
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:50,657
Speaker 0: So even if they start being unprofitable They're gonna be around for a long time.

332
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,149
Speaker 0: The car companies might just run out of money.

333
00:22:53,812 --> 00:23:01,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you look the US already we have you know The airplane companies and Amtrak and them and most of the X.

334
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,229
Speaker 1: not a good example, but for a lot of reasons I don't get into it.

335
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,075
Speaker 0: The point is is you have one Amtrak.

336
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:24,650
Speaker 0: the point is and that is that whether you support them or not the you have these Transportation related companies where if the government just didn't give them a bunch of tax money all the time They're incredibly unprofitable and inefficient and would go out of business and all those people wouldn't have jobs and it would be the end.

337
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,936
Speaker 1: Yep, now but at least in the case with the transportation things they provide it's kind of like the government is subsidizing this service.

338
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:36,943
Speaker 1: that is at least in the government's eyes or Possibly the lobbyists eyes a net boon to society.

339
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,804
Speaker 1: in a bit of perfect world Amtrak and failing airlines are at least a boon to.

340
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:46,890
Speaker 0: I think you know Ideally right as people always talk about, you know, the old socialism capitalism divide, right?

341
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:57,290
Speaker 0: And it's I think the way you have to handle it Which is something that is pretty obvious and just people don't say it often even though smart people all know it Is that there are some things out there?

342
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:19,012
Speaker 0: there are some services which there's no reason to profit from them either because a It's a necessary thing that is impossible to profit from you know, because it's just a losing deal be because it's something where you if the influences of you know profit invaded into that service.

343
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:29,717
Speaker 0: it would you know provide a you know a Negative effect on society as a whole, you know things like, you know medicines and you know transportation You know public transit and things like that.

344
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:36,300
Speaker 0: Really having those things be for-profit private companies is not is not gonna work out.

345
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of like for-profit prisons.

346
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:48,207
Speaker 1: bad idea Exactly exactly, but the point I was just trying to make is that at least with like the airlines and you know These sorts of things Amtrak.

347
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,560
Speaker 1: It's a direct boon to society.

348
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,092
Speaker 1: It's a direct boon to the people that's being subsidized.

349
00:24:53,133 --> 00:25:11,860
Speaker 1: but with the auto industry It's like this indirect boon because the old the boon to society is primarily that Towns and cities that otherwise do not have any sort of enough jobs to maintain themselves Have jobs like cities exist because these auto companies exist to create jobs.

350
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:16,300
Speaker 1: But it's like this indirect thing because we're creating them through this for-profit enterprise.

351
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:20,180
Speaker 1: And then the boon is the secondary effect as opposed to the primary effects.

352
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:26,720
Speaker 0: Yep, you know cuz like, you know if we pay money to keep say, you know American Airlines in business, right?

353
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:27,563
Speaker 0: What does that mean?

354
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:31,576
Speaker 0: Well, it means that American people can get from here to there, you know quickly.

355
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,969
Speaker 0: if we didn't do that You wouldn't be able to get everywhere.

356
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:37,340
Speaker 0: You'd only be able to get to the profitable cities.

357
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:38,849
Speaker 0: You wouldn't be able to fly to.

358
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,480
Speaker 0: you know, North Dakota, you know.

359
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:50,257
Speaker 0: But now because you know the government subsidizes these airlines you can fly to North Dakota Which is I guess useful for some people especially those who live in North Dakota, even though it doesn't exist.

360
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:50,900
Speaker 0: and they don't exist.

361
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,511
Speaker 1: But that's been a thing with Scott for a long time.

362
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:55,234
Speaker 0: I've never been there.

363
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,600
Speaker 0: I've never met anyone who is from there.

364
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:02,870
Speaker 0: We met people at RIT were from there Someone who said they had a friend who is from there.

365
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,315
Speaker 0: That's not good enough for me.

366
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:05,719
Speaker 1: Okay, do we have to go there?

367
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:06,883
Speaker 0: Why not?

368
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:10,263
Speaker 1: Cuz I mean I remember Iteration.

369
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:22,952
Speaker 0: I bet we'll just drive north from South Dakota We'll enter Canada and you'll be like see Scott we went through North Dakota and I'm like, aha sure remember that Plan alpha of desert bus involved going through North Dakota.

370
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:23,514
Speaker 0: Yeah.

371
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:33,025
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway, so You know with the subsidizing the airlines you get that sort of thing where now we can you know have Transportation for people in North Dakota.

372
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:36,756
Speaker 0: We did not have before subsidizing the airlines and the auto companies.

373
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:41,700
Speaker 0: All that does is You know keep all these people in their jobs.

374
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:58,365
Speaker 0: There's no other reason to keep you know subsidizing auto companies other than these people won't have any jobs because we can get cars from Japanese companies European companies or Even other American companies that are not, you know, we can get that are not Ford or GM, you know There there's at least one other.

375
00:26:58,465 --> 00:26:59,811
Speaker 1: well, but there's all it's.

376
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:11,717
Speaker 1: it's really difficult to talk about companies in that sense because the auto industry is really really incestuous a lot more than people realize and Companies make engines for each other and there's all sorts of overlap.

377
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:11,998
Speaker 1: Yeah.

378
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:20,400
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean you go to go to the actual Ford website like the Universal Ford website and you'll see all the logos of all the different things that are actually forward.

379
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:24,160
Speaker 0: Aston Martin is actually Ford Mazda's actually Ford.

380
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:35,795
Speaker 0: it's like there's a whole bunch of things that are actually Ford besides Ford and basically everything else is GM, but So it's not a problem with us not having enough cars.

381
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:37,120
Speaker 0: There are plenty of cars.

382
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,620
Speaker 0: We don't really need more except for you know, people like to buy new ones, but there's you know the demand for cars.

383
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:53,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't think of one possible Boon indirectly for creating these cars by hat by making sure that there are a lot of domestic cars available.

384
00:27:54,482 --> 00:28:09,280
Speaker 1: It drives the price of foreign cars down because if there were only foreign cars and a limited number of domestic cars Then over time the price of cars would go up because there's no competition internally and there's no incentive for foreign companies to offer lower prices.

385
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:10,409
Speaker 0: That's true.

386
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,014
Speaker 0: That's true.

387
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:13,886
Speaker 0: But that's Such an indirect.

388
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:32,172
Speaker 0: the other thing is that the foreign companies, you know would end up still competing with each other for you know The because the supply of cars might fall under the demand and then you would have these, you know They would all compete over, you know by the you know, the French car no by the Japanese car No by the you know, whatever car that you know.

389
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,740
Speaker 0: that competition would drive the prices down.

390
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,860
Speaker 1: But I guess I would argue that having the domestic mark the domestic production at least stabilizes car prices.

391
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:48,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in in a short-term way Yeah, I think yeah, but I think that's what stabilizing does it makes things less prone to change in the short term exactly.

392
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:50,246
Speaker 0: So the thing is.

393
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:56,352
Speaker 0: the major problem here is I actually on the one hand I say man We should just let those car companies go out of business.

394
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,980
Speaker 0: They were poorly managed, right?

395
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,466
Speaker 0: They were spending their money like stupid.

396
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:02,292
Speaker 0: they you know, we're not.

397
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:04,940
Speaker 0: you know driving up demand for cars.

398
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:10,819
Speaker 0: You know spending way too much money in advertising not enough on making newer better cars building a whole bunch of SUVs.

399
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:21,628
Speaker 0: You know, they I point out something really sad that I learned they did right, you know ever since Roger Rabbit way back in the day It's just been bad for no Something really bad today.

400
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:27,186
Speaker 1: remember when gas prices were going up and up and up and like SUV sales Collapsed and they lost money on the SUVs.

401
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,814
Speaker 1: Yeah SUV sales are way up.

402
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:31,338
Speaker 1: Now the gas prices are back down.

403
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:39,360
Speaker 1: Yeah I think the FARC headline was as more proof that people never learn from their mistakes and never look to the past for guidance.

404
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I still understand why people buy SUVs, but that's not what I'm talking about.

405
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:50,020
Speaker 0: So on, you know going by that I feel like we should let these companies go out of business.

406
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:54,460
Speaker 0: They're not a company like, you know Amtrak where or American Airlines.

407
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,099
Speaker 0: So they provide where they're providing something that is can't be profitable, but it's sort of necessary infrastructure in a way.

408
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:16,171
Speaker 0: But But It's not because I didn't want to say but They're not providing any a necessary infrastructure kind of thing.

409
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:24,528
Speaker 0: And if they went out of business, they're just wouldn't be nude GM cars, they wouldn't you know, but By letting them go in the wrong place.

410
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:27,260
Speaker 0: Yes, but by letting them go out of business, right?

411
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:32,054
Speaker 0: All of these unskilled laborers will lose their jobs not just unskilled.

412
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:33,939
Speaker 1: there are a lot of highly skilled laborers, too.

413
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,089
Speaker 0: Yes, the thing is right is that you don't?

414
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,360
Speaker 0: it's it's like if we let the companies go out of business.

415
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:40,467
Speaker 0: You don't feel bad for the highly skilled laborers.

416
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:44,160
Speaker 0: They would get new jobs, you know, well the executives could get new jobs.

417
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,862
Speaker 0: It depends.

418
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,770
Speaker 1: the executives are not highly trained labor.

419
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,271
Speaker 1: Most of them.

420
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:48,777
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but it's like.

421
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:56,602
Speaker 0: but like you Don't have a choice of like, you know, cuz the reason the company's doing bad is not because of the factory workers It's because.

422
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:57,666
Speaker 0: well who may

423
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:22,180
Speaker 1: well part of the problem why the American car companies are doing so poorly is because of the workers but again indirectly because of the benefits that were paid and Promised due to the unions back when the car industry was very profitable are still liabilities today and pensions and health care And things are so much higher for American car companies and other car companies, which I'm not arguing against.

424
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:23,396
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's kind of how it is.

425
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:26,900
Speaker 1: That is one of the primary reasons they're having so much trouble.

426
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:28,525
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing right.

427
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:38,043
Speaker 0: and when the economy is bad the companies, you know in bargaining with unions Should have a lot more power and they should be able to just say look pensions are gone You're screwed.

428
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,720
Speaker 0: now either you do what we say or you're gonna have no jobs in this bad economy.

429
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:47,300
Speaker 1: Screwing the pensions only hurts all the old people who were promised the pensions and that's how they're retiring.

430
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:53,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, but either either hey, you know, we screw the pensions and they can't retire on that.

431
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:57,260
Speaker 0: But you know now, okay, so I get your social security.

432
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,188
Speaker 0: Well, no the other doing it.

433
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:06,546
Speaker 0: the way we're doing it is basically saying here you can have your pension But now we're gonna tax it all the way from you to give the money back to your company So it stays in business.

434
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:08,660
Speaker 1: Well, no because the the tax is funding.

435
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,533
Speaker 1: This would be coming from you and me not from the people living in Detroit.

436
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:13,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's real fair.

437
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,183
Speaker 1: We are paying for that.

438
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:22,818
Speaker 1: It's got we and by we I mean people living in like New York and Major urban centers and the quote-unquote blue states.

439
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:25,480
Speaker 1: now I'm not trying to make a value judgment here by any stretch.

440
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:36,140
Speaker 1: But we basically fund the existence of many places in the rest of the country And I'm fine with that for a lot of historical and societal reasons, but that's kind of how it is.

441
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,806
Speaker 1: Anyway, so how is this any different?

442
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,479
Speaker 1: Well the thing here, I guess it's different because Michigan's a blue state.

443
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:54,325
Speaker 0: the thing is right is We're entering a situation where what do we do about the fact that there is you know in a world where we don't yet Have in a world.

444
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:57,859
Speaker 0: Yes, we we all know we all know that someday, right?

445
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,840
Speaker 0: We'll invent some sort of nanotechnology diamond age type replicator technology and even people who don't want to work.

446
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:17,375
Speaker 0: We're able to live at some subsisting level doing absolutely nothing and you know, they'll be able to eat and have some sort of protective shelter and clothing and Then you know the the people who want to do things will do things.

447
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:34,200
Speaker 0: people don't want to do anything Just won't do anything and we'll just get the bare minimum that is provided for effectively no cost by technology however, we are not yet at that point, but We are approaching a situation where there is less demand for unskilled labor in the world.

448
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:43,040
Speaker 0: Then there is a supply and the only way people have of making a living in this world of you know Getting anything beyond nothing is with their labor.

449
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,708
Speaker 0: That's all someone has is you know, their skills their work.

450
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:49,679
Speaker 0: and if there is no demand for work, then what are people gonna do?

451
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,911
Speaker 0: To just get food and a shelter?

452
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:54,640
Speaker 0: if their work is worth nothing?

453
00:33:55,202 --> 00:34:09,292
Speaker 0: Now then we don't yet have a technological solution that lets them live You know at a minimum level for free and they have nothing that anyone wants from them and there's nothing they can do now Even if we skip over that part.

454
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:12,697
Speaker 1: and you know The kind of longer-term scenario even in the short term.

455
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:22,190
Speaker 1: Feel bad for the engineers and the highly skilled workers too in these situations because it's coal miner syndrome where I'm a coal miner I work in the coal mine in the coal mining town.

456
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:31,105
Speaker 1: if the coal mine closes I Have to leave because there is no other coal mine for me to work in and coal mining is my skill The engineer.

457
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,315
Speaker 0: I think a problem today is a lot of people refuse to leave.

458
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:33,998
Speaker 0: they just sit there.

459
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:45,913
Speaker 1: But at the same time if you have a family, it's I mean the way America is it is very very difficult if you do not have a lot of money or If you have a family to just pick up and leave.

460
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:47,219
Speaker 1: it takes a long time.

461
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:48,766
Speaker 1: It takes a long time to sell a house.

462
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,274
Speaker 1: takes a long time to buy a house.

463
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,804
Speaker 1: if you pull kids out of school That's usually not good for them.

464
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,190
Speaker 1: You know during a year or something.

465
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,280
Speaker 1: It's difficult to put down roots in a new place.

466
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,220
Speaker 1: It's difficult to get a job somewhere else.

467
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:06,648
Speaker 1: I mean if you lost your job You probably don't have that much money to go flying around all the different cities going to job interviews That aren't even guaranteed.

468
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:18,210
Speaker 1: new jobs like giving phone interviews Yeah But no company does that with the and not that many nice companies will fly you out for a job interview and also all the places That have jobs like New York.

469
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:19,640
Speaker 1: You can't afford a house.

470
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:23,553
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to live way way outside and commute like crazy, and it's not.

471
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:24,897
Speaker 1: it's a bad situation.

472
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:31,040
Speaker 1: get some roommates Yeah, but if you have live someplace crappy yeah, but if you have a large family that makes it even more difficult.

473
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:32,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you know you've.

474
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:39,994
Speaker 0: well There's you know that's a separate issue that we keep discussing of people having families that you know they but this situation I mean these are people who?

475
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,120
Speaker 1: Could afford their family and we're doing well and head plan for the future.

476
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:51,337
Speaker 1: But they've been slowly put into the situation where there is no easy way out where the planning was for.

477
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:55,328
Speaker 1: not because Factors they have no control over fucked them that is true.

478
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:55,809
Speaker 0: However.

479
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:02,929
Speaker 0: You know there are some factors in which you know for example I You know know how to program computers.

480
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,700
Speaker 1: yes because you were born with a silver spoon.

481
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,620
Speaker 1: To go to one of the most prestigious.

482
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:12,630
Speaker 0: Let's say right nobody needs computer programmers.

483
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:17,791
Speaker 0: every more someone writes a program that writes every program That's ever needed, and we don't need computer programmers anymore.

484
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:19,440
Speaker 0: There are things I can do.

485
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:23,240
Speaker 0: I have other skills that I can sell that are worth something.

486
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,661
Speaker 0: I you know.

487
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:29,460
Speaker 0: I could get a different sort of job in some other industry that would be at a similar level.

488
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:45,928
Speaker 1: However, I would argue that the main reason we have that luxury and the reason we have so many Skit like marketable skills outside of our primary skills is that we grew up in relatively affluent wealthy middle-class to offer middle-class Lifestyles are?

489
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,220
Speaker 1: we didn't have to work that much?

490
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,189
Speaker 1: But if we're in we could skip.

491
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:51,983
Speaker 1: we didn't have to work for most of our lives And when we did.

492
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:52,748
Speaker 1: it was trivial work.

493
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:54,740
Speaker 1: we had a lot of time to pursue varied interests.

494
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,800
Speaker 1: We went to universities which got us a lot of well-rounded skills.

495
00:36:58,562 --> 00:36:59,966
Speaker 0: You're a coal miner right.

496
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:13,448
Speaker 0: you may have not had an opportunity in your life to go to college and to learn all these things earlier In life, but if you were at a point in which you know you're a coal miner in a town and you coal mine But you're doing well you can afford your family.

497
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:14,511
Speaker 0: You're doing okay.

498
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:15,915
Speaker 0: You're responsible right now.

499
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:23,338
Speaker 0: You could learn new things Right now if you didn't have you know the ambition to you know or or the forethought to say I?

500
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,713
Speaker 0: Could learn something else just in case the coal mine goes under because you you know.

501
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:31,960
Speaker 0: you know you're in a precarious Position even if the coal mines doing really well.

502
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,922
Speaker 0: You know that if the coal mine goes away You're fucked.

503
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:43,115
Speaker 0: so but at the same time knowing that as you're saying time while you're good You should do something to make sure that you know you're okay in the future.

504
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:50,780
Speaker 1: at the same time one If you're raising a family and working full-time you might not have the time to reasonably do that or at least not do it quickly.

505
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,940
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of people probably saw the writing on the wall.

506
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:57,640
Speaker 0: Hey, this isn't going so well, but you got to do something before the writing is on the wall.

507
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,450
Speaker 1: Yes, but even then by like even the long-term like all right.

508
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,297
Speaker 1: I see problems a decade down the road.

509
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:06,777
Speaker 1: go to night school Yeah, but if you're also are taking care of the family life is hard.

510
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:16,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, well see the other problem here is that if everyone affected by these economic troubles had done this then there still wouldn't be Enough jobs forever.

511
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:17,020
Speaker 0: That's true.

512
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:25,348
Speaker 1: It only works because most of the people in these situations either can't or don't take advantage of these ideas.

513
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:28,048
Speaker 1: if everyone did Everyone's right.

514
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:38,751
Speaker 0: if every coal miner went to night school Then we'd have a million people who learned some valuable skill and thus the supply of that Particular skill would be high and the demand would be less than the supply.

515
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:43,759
Speaker 0: and you know the people already getting paid to do whatever Those coal miners learned how to do would get paid less.

516
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:53,160
Speaker 1: Anyway, and the whole thing would yeah, because we should try to wrap this up at least somewhat reasonably quickly I actually have what I think is a really good idea on how to deal with this situation.

517
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:54,161
Speaker 0: Oh, dude I was

518
00:38:54,222 --> 00:39:04,672
Speaker 1: inspired because you happen to pick a topic that I read a lot about in the last week Because earlier in the week I I found a Wall Street Journal laying on the ground like in continue

519
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:09,137
Speaker 0: to intentionally make companies inefficient Thus requiring more human labor.

520
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:09,419
Speaker 0: No, no.

521
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:22,458
Speaker 1: I'm talking about like what could the government of this country do like right now to make the situation To make the best of the current situation not talking about what could we have done in the past not talking besides

522
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,140
Speaker 0: public works

523
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,557
Speaker 1: But right now like specifically what could we do?

524
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,520
Speaker 0: Hire all the let the car companies go out of business and hire all of them to build the bridges and the roads?

525
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,780
Speaker 1: No, the power lines because actually there is a nice article about.

526
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:51,372
Speaker 1: Basically the Democratic Party and Barack Obama are kind of taking a gamble in that They're pushing for action to be taken and there he's kind of taking a big role in this already Even though he's not president yet, but he's a senator.

527
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:52,195
Speaker 0: He can still Senate.

528
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:53,860
Speaker 1: He's not taking the Senate in role.

529
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,867
Speaker 1: He's taking the president in role That's true, but he can still.

530
00:39:56,887 --> 00:40:02,758
Speaker 0: you know, if he's taking the president in role and you know something You know is required some legislation moving through you can go to the Senate and vote.

531
00:40:02,798 --> 00:40:06,835
Speaker 1: Yes Control the House and Senate so we can't anyway and Bush vetoes it.

532
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:07,800
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, don't wait.

533
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,760
Speaker 0: No, don't the don't the new senators and House people not go in until the next session or whatever.

534
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,490
Speaker 1: But we already control this business.

535
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:15,939
Speaker 1: just we control it more anyway.

536
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:22,020
Speaker 1: One of the ideas and I'm the idea wasn't this but I expanded on this idea.

537
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:26,178
Speaker 1: Here's what I would do were I the president and I would do it by.

538
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:34,760
Speaker 1: you know Getting Congress on board and you know Executive orders and all the different ways The president can pull strings and press releases and speeches to get people on board with this.

539
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,720
Speaker 1: But I would one bail out the companies if they agreed to my terms.

540
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:46,380
Speaker 1: The terms would be yes, you will be bailed out in return.

541
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:47,946
Speaker 1: we will either get.

542
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:52,641
Speaker 1: the government will either get a controlling interest in the company or He got.

543
00:40:53,144 --> 00:41:01,420
Speaker 1: the board of directors will be replaced or Added to by government regulators who will basically sit on the company.

544
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,512
Speaker 1: Make sure that you don't waste any of the money we gave you.

545
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:23,577
Speaker 1: make sure that the end goal which is to make sure jobs are available in these places to prevent the average people from being screwed happen and basically take over the companies halfway as the government and force the companies to do what's in the best interest of the country and Part of that would probably be not paying out these bonuses and all sorts of.

546
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:29,721
Speaker 1: you know minutia that I don't want to get into now and I can't think of a better way to handle it than that I Would.

547
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:33,720
Speaker 1: just bailing them out encourages them to do the same bullshit to us in the future.

548
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:38,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, not bailing them out screws a whole lot of people in a way that I'm not willing to do.

549
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:46,152
Speaker 0: The problem is right is even if the government took over these, you know Let's say the government took over Ford in that way, right and they they did all.

550
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,500
Speaker 0: let's assume the best possible situation.

551
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,093
Speaker 0: Right did all the right things?

552
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:50,839
Speaker 0: they you know.

553
00:41:51,201 --> 00:42:01,020
Speaker 0: every single person who's getting paid a lot of money is now getting paid poop and you know We're just making sure everyone still has jobs and we do everything we can to you know, try to make it profitable.

554
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:11,299
Speaker 0: Maybe right now all the taxpayers own this unprofitable company that slowly loses money for everyone all the time instead of you know, just losing money for this set of shareholders.

555
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,810
Speaker 0: and It's you know, it's we got.

556
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,400
Speaker 1: that's why one way to go about it.

557
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:24,259
Speaker 1: Instead of having the controlling interest like owning the stock in the company is Having government people on the board who can veto anything stupid the company tries to do.

558
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:25,385
Speaker 1: basically It's just so.

559
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:33,320
Speaker 1: the government still doesn't have the liability beyond the bailout But at the same time the government has the control to force the company to act in the best interest of the nation.

560
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:35,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then when is the government gonna?

561
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:37,599
Speaker 0: you know, we got to have some anything like that.

562
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,746
Speaker 1: Yes There's a lot of minutia.

563
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:39,672
Speaker 1: I've thought them all through.

564
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:40,779
Speaker 1: I don't want to spend 20 minutes.

565
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:44,760
Speaker 0: Anything like that needs some sort of phasing out deal where you know, we let it go.

566
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,427
Speaker 1: That is very clearly part of the plan.

567
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:51,800
Speaker 1: I could tell you my specific idea, but yeah, I don't know.

568
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,101
Speaker 0: I'm just.

569
00:42:52,242 --> 00:43:02,698
Speaker 0: I'm more interested in not you know, the particular very specific government right now solution But in sort of the entire world society solution of you know.

570
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,294
Speaker 0: Right now we have an account.

571
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:09,014
Speaker 0: the world Economy basically says if you provide labor you'll be you get something.

572
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:10,560
Speaker 0: if you don't provide labor you get nothing.

573
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:18,809
Speaker 0: But there is less demand for labor than there are people who will provide it and thus they're people who no matter what they do There's no one who wants, you know to feed them.

574
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,700
Speaker 0: Basically, what do we what do we do as that ratio?

575
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:28,900
Speaker 0: Changes and technology is not yet solved it even though it may in the future just an alternate system of distributing scarce resources.

576
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:29,926
Speaker 1: Simple done.

577
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:31,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, what system would that be?

578
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,647
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day.

579
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:41,349
Speaker 0: Oh and the things.

580
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,480
Speaker 0: they in the middle bears playing hockey.

581
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:48,071
Speaker 1: I'm not going to explain to you whether or not this is real.

582
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:53,085
Speaker 1: I simply want you to observe the spectacle of Bears playing hockey.

583
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:58,220
Speaker 0: only this could only be in an old Russian video in what I can only assume is a Russian circus.

584
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:06,100
Speaker 0: You must be All right, so, you know for much of my life, you know being at least Jewish by birth and whatnot.

585
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,760
Speaker 1: You know it as opposed to Jewish by injection.

586
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:21,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has been very apparent that you know Despite there being gourmet chefs and iron chefs that the the greatest chefs in all the world are Jewish and Italian Grandmas, right they can out cook anyone, you know you get.

587
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,880
Speaker 0: you know, fancy guy went to culinary school from France.

588
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,812
Speaker 0: Whatever, you know get someone's grandma up ins and they got nothing right?

589
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:30,477
Speaker 0: It's it's just well known.

590
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:31,360
Speaker 0: It's it's a fact.

591
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,022
Speaker 0: That's how it is.

592
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:37,080
Speaker 0: So I was wondering why aren't the old Jewish and Italian grandmas on the TV cooking shows?

593
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,847
Speaker 0: Why are at these culinary people?

594
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:41,336
Speaker 0: Why why don't the grandma's open up the restaurants?

595
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:42,420
Speaker 0: They just cook for the family.

596
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,354
Speaker 0: They never open up a restaurant or anything, you know, they could rake it in.

597
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:46,520
Speaker 0: who wouldn't want to go, you know.

598
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:52,359
Speaker 0: It's like this amazing special treat to get like, you know Grandma's food maybe three times a year somewhat something like that.

599
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:56,200
Speaker 0: If you could just go and buy it whenever you want it all man's it would be amazing.

600
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,369
Speaker 0: And I had a much simpler idea of.

601
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:00,799
Speaker 0: you know, why doesn't someone just you know?

602
00:45:01,462 --> 00:45:04,897
Speaker 0: Make a YouTube or something of their grandma cooking.

603
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:10,000
Speaker 0: and You know, I had that idea for many years much like I had the idea for dig for many years.

604
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:10,989
Speaker 0: Well close to it.

605
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:12,200
Speaker 0: Everyone had the idea to make slash.

606
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:13,807
Speaker 1: See you avoided that.

607
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:15,455
Speaker 1: you would have been the one.

608
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:21,520
Speaker 0: you would have been the man Everyone in the whole world knew wanted a slash dot where the people where the users voted.

609
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,910
Speaker 0: Yes, but now we see one person did it and everyone else.

610
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,592
Speaker 0: but it's just going.

611
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:29,740
Speaker 1: fuck I know because now we see what we Have wrought and we despair.

612
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:43,263
Speaker 0: that is true head is true because dig made me lose faith in all forms of internet democracy, but You know the idea to had just videotaped grandma cooking has been around for a while and no one did it until Just now.

613
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,992
Speaker 0: some guy did it and that's my thing of the day.

614
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,600
Speaker 0: It's a let's see feed me.

615
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,499
Speaker 0: Bubby is the name of the video this.

616
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:51,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bubby is the Hebrew word for grandma.

617
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:55,734
Speaker 0: so and he's he's got his Yiddish grandma and she's cooking it up.

618
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:56,778
Speaker 0: and it's a video.

619
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:01,699
Speaker 0: and Some of the videos are loading a little slowly when I tried to watch them downstairs, but they work.

620
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:09,951
Speaker 0: So just you know, pause it let it load up and learn how to cook Traditional Jewish grandma food, which is you know, the best food there is.

621
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,918
Speaker 0: so, you know, why watch Food Network?

622
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:15,986
Speaker 1: I don't know alright, so, uh Martin Luther King jr.

623
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,540
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read the bed because you don't know about this.

624
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,400
Speaker 1: This is I'm curious to see your reaction, but I'll start by reading the FARC headline.

625
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:24,345
Speaker 0: Well, how I don't know.

626
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,054
Speaker 0: first of all, he wasn't that really rich.

627
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:27,140
Speaker 0: so how does he have a big estate?

628
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,919
Speaker 1: I'm going to start by reading the FARC headline and I'm going to work from there.

629
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:37,145
Speaker 1: Hopefully I will elucidate all That can be elucidated.

630
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,452
Speaker 1: illuminate all that can be illuminated.

631
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:43,965
Speaker 1: all this and more as I'm in an illuminated manuscript Free at last.

632
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:45,412
Speaker 0: Thank you God almighty.

633
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:47,080
Speaker 1: We're free at last.

634
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:49,519
Speaker 1: Licensing and registration fees still apply.

635
00:46:50,304 --> 00:46:50,659
Speaker 0: Okay

636
00:46:51,500 --> 00:47:15,540
Speaker 1: basically The story is that the Martin Luther King estate is a rigidly controlled Copyright trademark machine and if you want to have a picture of Martin Luther King or quote his speeches or do anything Anything at all and they go after people who use up You know all their rights to parody and such too and they do anything they can to force their trademark and copyright rights.

637
00:47:16,243 --> 00:47:18,432
Speaker 1: You need to pay the estate of Martin Luther King jr.

638
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:19,677
Speaker 1: To use his speeches.

639
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:20,240
Speaker 1: his likenesses.

640
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,274
Speaker 0: You can't put I have a dream on YouTube without paying money.

641
00:47:23,636 --> 00:47:25,444
Speaker 1: Ah, that is correct You can't.

642
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:26,748
Speaker 0: what about the federal government?

643
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:28,093
Speaker 0: shouldn't the federal government have to pay?

644
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:31,659
Speaker 0: they got Martin Luther King Day Shouldn't have to pay for that holiday.

645
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:33,979
Speaker 0: Basically, it's infringing that holiday.

646
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:38,499
Speaker 1: they forced people to pay to license the likeness of Martin Luther King jr.

647
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:41,868
Speaker 1: and all of his words and anything depicting.

648
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:48,890
Speaker 0: if it's Martin Luther King Day and I draw a picture of Martin Luther King and put it outside my business saying Isaac Newton Ferris jr.

649
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,790
Speaker 1: King's nephew and head of the nonprofit Is his name really Isaac Newton?

650
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:53,554
Speaker 0: Yes.

651
00:47:53,675 --> 00:48:14,620
Speaker 1: Oh my god Head of the King Center in Atlanta said the estate is entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars in licensing fees maybe even millions due to Merchandise depicting Martin Luther King standing next to Barack Obama that is being sold on the streets throughout this nation.

652
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,785
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's just not true.

653
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:18,960
Speaker 0: He's gonna go to court and lose because now they win these all the time.

654
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,084
Speaker 0: Well, you can't treat you.

655
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,393
Speaker 0: It's someone's it's the picture of a person.

Speaker 1: They trademarked Martin Luther King jr.

657
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:28,977
Speaker 0: You can't trademark what a person looks like especially if they're a stork or famous person.

658
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:29,940
Speaker 0: They did you can't.

659
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,805
Speaker 0: How did they win in court?

660
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:32,970
Speaker 1: They just win.

661
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:39,340
Speaker 0: All right, so I'm Trey, you know, so wait Yes, anyone is allowed to you know, take like photographs in public, right?

662
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:40,866
Speaker 0: Right, am I right?

663
00:48:40,886 --> 00:48:49,879
Speaker 1: roach realizing the value of his ideas King himself Copyrighted well registered the copyright of several of his speeches during his lifetime after he died.

664
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,566
Speaker 0: Do you can copyright his speech?

665
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:52,229

666
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,651
Speaker 1: Yes.

667
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:54,920
Speaker 1: So all mine all of his speeches are copyrighted.

668
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,239
Speaker 1: That's fun not in the public domain.

669
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:58,704
Speaker 0: Maybe so.

670
00:48:58,825 --> 00:49:00,249
Speaker 1: but well, yes, it's so.

671
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,674
Speaker 1: he's not that old remember.

672
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:04,143
Speaker 1: basically nothing enters the public Don't ever?

673
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:08,120
Speaker 0: if sure right the speech itself is not entered the public domain.

674
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,247
Speaker 0: I could not print it in a book right?

675
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:13,900
Speaker 0: However, he was in public right when he gave speed.

676
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:27,060
Speaker 0: There are certain speeches he gave in public places where he could be videotaped Publicly and if you appear in public and are videotaped by just someone standing there They own that video even if you're in it and you have no say whatsoever.

677
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,320
Speaker 0: Yes, however That's why you know the news can just go out with video cameras and put things on the news.

678
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:44,160
Speaker 1: however most of these things or at least a lot of the ones that you see have Ended up being falling under the copyright or in the very least have ended up with this group being paid royalties or other.

679
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:46,896
Speaker 0: Yes, that's also right.

680
00:49:48,142 --> 00:49:50,520
Speaker 0: It's just if you a picture of Martin Luther King.

681
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:59,843
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure there's a picture of him somewhere and that picture itself was taken by a photographer And that photographer owns the rights of that picture and I could just be like no I'm.

682
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:02,574
Speaker 0: I'm making a likeness of that picture and the photographer is letting me.

683
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:04,260
Speaker 0: I'm not making a likeness of Martin Luther King.

684
00:50:04,826 --> 00:50:06,160
Speaker 1: I can tell them on whatever I want.

685
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:12,873
Speaker 1: The legal issues around this are extra complicated But many people have tried to fight against these people and lost over the years.

686
00:50:13,234 --> 00:50:14,158
Speaker 0: Why are they losing?

687
00:50:14,198 --> 00:50:14,840
Speaker 0: This is ridiculous.

688
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,725
Speaker 1: So what what they're doing now?

689
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:23,886
Speaker 1: quote Ferris says he expects to announce deals in the coming weeks to license some items featuring Images of Martin Luther King jr.

690
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:33,520
Speaker 1: And Barack Obama that are going to be sold in the King Center and on websites and things alongside recordings of speeches postcards calendars mugs bearing images of King and other licensed merchandise.

691
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I guess they want.

692
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:50,814
Speaker 1: you know It's so weird that someone Scott the estate even sued CBS over their you their sale of a video documentary on Martin Luther King that happened to include excerpts from the.

693
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:52,040
Speaker 1: I have a dream speech.

694
00:50:52,180 --> 00:51:03,590
Speaker 1: Well as much as I like Martin Luther King and the appeals court ruled in 99 that the speech was in fact covered not public domain and Eventually CBS settle out of court for a large amount of money.

695
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:04,714
Speaker 0: what the hell wusses.

696
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,100
Speaker 0: no one fights for anything.

697
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,344
Speaker 1: Well, because the court basically said CBS you can't win this anyway, they It's weird.

698
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:14,993
Speaker 0: It's like everyone likes Martin Luther King.

699
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:15,798
Speaker 0: He's totally awesome.

700
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:16,240
Speaker 0: I guess success.

701
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:19,616
Speaker 0: I can think of people who don't like the KKK doesn't like him, but everyone else likes it.

702
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:26,380
Speaker 0: and You know, the thing is it's the Martin Luther King's, you know foundation or trust or whatever these people are.

703
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,140
Speaker 0: It's their job to guess make people like and know Martin Luther King even more.

704
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:35,840
Speaker 0: But they seem to all they want to do is make people not like Martin Luther King.

705
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,908
Speaker 0: They want to make it, you know, keep them out of the textbooks Keep them out of the schools.

706
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:41,053
Speaker 0: Keep them out of the t-shirts.

707
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:43,750
Speaker 0: make it so no one sees them No one hears them and no one likes.

708
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:47,569
Speaker 0: and if that's what they want Maybe we should just stop talking about Martin Luther King.

709
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:49,356
Speaker 0: Let's not put his picture anywhere.

710
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:52,560
Speaker 0: Let's not talk about him Let's not put up his videos or anything.

711
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:56,840
Speaker 0: Let's just pretend like you did because that seems to be what they want right just like the record companies, right?

712
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,129
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, sure.

713
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:01,380
Speaker 0: We want our job is to make everyone like this music.

714
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,811
Speaker 0: We're gonna do that by making sure nobody hears it.

715
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:04,715
Speaker 0: Sure.

716
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:08,360
Speaker 0: If that's what you want fine No one will listen to your music and we won't like it anymore.

717
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,299
Speaker 1: But I'm surprised you didn't know about the long-term issues with the fact that the can never heard of this before ever.

718
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,108
Speaker 1: the King Estate is one of the most.

719
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:17,260
Speaker 0: very surprised that they haven't won in court.

720
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,880
Speaker 1: The King Estate is one of the most aggressive pursuers of copyright actions in America outside of the RIAA.

721
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,160
Speaker 0: See this comes back to what you know, Lawrence Lessig and Cory Doctorow and all those people always say about copyright.

722
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,170
Speaker 0: is that this you know, this copyright.

723
00:52:30,271 --> 00:52:31,718
Speaker 0: and then there's this culture.

724
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:46,460
Speaker 0: and These people are using copyright not to you know, get the temporary monopoly to incentivize creative endeavors but to actually Strangle culture and to remove things from the culture.

725
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,374
Speaker 0: The record companies are removing their music from the culture.

726
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:53,900
Speaker 0: the you know The King Estate is trying to remove Martin Luther King from the culture.

727
00:52:54,041 --> 00:53:01,440
Speaker 0: I know that's not probably their goal in their mind, but by aggressively You know trying to enforce these copyrights and trademarks and things.

728
00:53:01,922 --> 00:53:12,060
Speaker 0: That is the result of what will happen if they get their way on those issues is Martin Luther King will be More removed from the culture than he is now where he is very much a part of the culture.

729
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,500
Speaker 0: Now one thing I say the best solution is to just let the people dig their own graves.

730
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:23,839
Speaker 1: the the article that slash shot the specific article that slash shot links to is Pretty bad and actually has some inaccuracies in it.

731
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,420
Speaker 1: So I wouldn't go by that but this is something that's bothered me for as long as I've known about it.

732
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:40,680
Speaker 1: But as Scott said, I think the relevant quote here is to promote the progress of science and useful arts By securing for a limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive right to the respective writings and discoveries.

733
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,328
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean this is remote.

734
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:45,563
Speaker 1: the progress of science and useful arts Yeah, that is the.

735
00:53:45,844 --> 00:53:49,397
Speaker 1: that is the only reason we have copyright law according to the Constitution.

736
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:49,798
Speaker 1: That's it.

737
00:53:49,878 --> 00:53:50,240
Speaker 1: It's there.

738
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:53,380
Speaker 0: Well, that's it's actually enumerating the powers of Congress.

739
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,899
Speaker 0: So it's actually Congress has the power to promote the you know, useful arts, etc.

740
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:04,020
Speaker 1: It's although Congress has the power to grant inventors and artists exclusive rights in order to promote the progress.

741
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,611
Speaker 0: Yes by making laws and yes the whole right.

742
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:08,620
Speaker 0: Anyway, the thing is right.

743
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,194
Speaker 1: I would argue that any law that doesn't clearly show to promote the progress of science.

744
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,660
Speaker 1: Do you is unconstitutional?

745
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that's the thing.

746
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:15,880
Speaker 0: Do you remember the Grokster case?

747
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,803
Speaker 0: Yes that we lost.

748
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:19,654
Speaker 0: yeah in the Grokster case, right or was I forget what?

749
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:20,858
Speaker 0: or was it that Sonny Bono?

750
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:21,340
Speaker 0: but there?

751
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Speaker 0: I forget exactly.

752
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,020
Speaker 1: They're like eight cases Sonny Bono, but basically they went to the suppose the one where you lost and they're right.

753
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:27,582
Speaker 1: Yes, you can.

754
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,489
Speaker 0: you can extend it the Sonny Bono.

755
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:31,395
Speaker 1: You can't extend it anymore after this.

756
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:33,565
Speaker 0: Well what that wasn't it easy That was the next one.

757
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:34,389
Speaker 0: that wasn't it either.

758
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:35,455
Speaker 0: basically what it was.

759
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,360
Speaker 1: timeline of this shit.

760
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:44,380
Speaker 0: Listen that the Sonny Bono Copyright Act extended copyright from I guess What was it 75 years to 99 years something like that, right?

761
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,748
Speaker 0: And they went to challenge it in the Supreme Court.

762
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:54,760
Speaker 0: and the Supreme Court says, you know Well, you know the the law says limited right that the Constitution says limited times.

763
00:54:55,141 --> 00:55:01,717
Speaker 0: So when they argued at the Supreme Court, they said look because they keep extending copyright every time it's about to expire.

764
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:12,874
Speaker 0: It's effectively Unlimited and even though there's this particular law has a limit of 99. by keep making these extensions It's effectively unlimited and therefore unconstitutional.

765
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:14,160
Speaker 0: That's the argument they made us.

766
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,482
Speaker 1: But I remember this that the Supreme Court basically said that if they continue to do it No No what the kind?

767
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:29,352
Speaker 0: what they said is look they extended to 99 and they had a reason to extend it to 99 because of all The recent things that have been going on on the internet and whatnot, right?

768
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:31,580
Speaker 0: There was a reason for this extension.

769
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:35,996
Speaker 0: We don't see, you know, some sort of trend of infinite, you know extension.

770
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:40,020
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I was saying No, no, they didn't say don't extend it anymore.

771
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:54,929
Speaker 0: Well, they said was if there becomes a trend of extending it with the purposes of making it infinite Yeah, they said, you know if there is a further extension if there's no reason for the further extensions and whatnot then maybe Maybe then they won't be allowed.

772
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:58,320
Speaker 0: but you know, they didn't rule out any further extensions either, right?

773
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:03,200
Speaker 0: They said if there is more extensions without reason then maybe this argument would work.

774
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:11,229
Speaker 0: the problem is they no one has tried to make the argument based on the first part, which is Promotion of the useful arts and sciences.

775
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:11,791
Speaker 0: Are you?

776
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:17,420
Speaker 0: no one is not that I've seen not in the Supreme Court anyway Not in a big case that was all over the internet geek news.

777
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,380
Speaker 1: But maybe in the past, I mean copyright has been extended many many many times and that's true.

778
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:42,711
Speaker 0: And I think I remember I'm not sure about this But I think I remember someone saying, you know, one of those big lawyers maybe Lessig or someone else Saying after that case we should have argued the useful arts and sciences instead of arguing, you know the limited You know time and you know, and I just don't know, you know I think if we made that argument is presented well that we would totally win.

779
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,280
Speaker 0: like look we have a situation where software patents are Actually doing the opposite or promoting useful.

780
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,004
Speaker 1: Here's why it wouldn't work.

781
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:58,018
Speaker 1: because the argument against that is that they are in fact promoting and they have a Equally sounding valid argument and no one on the Supreme Court understands the issue.

782
00:56:58,078 --> 00:57:00,105
Speaker 1: No, no one Involved.

783
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:05,549
Speaker 1: I would say that no one involved in the judiciary Understands what the issue is with software patents.

784
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:12,520
Speaker 1: No, I would argue that not a single judge in the world actually Understands why we don't like software patents.

785
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:16,071
Speaker 0: No, but if you went to zoom in court explain, you know, they're not.

786
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,727
Speaker 0: you know, some of the judges are not good But they're not stupid people.

787
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:21,514
Speaker 0: They if you explained it to them.

788
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,900
Speaker 0: They're smarter than Ted Stevens.

789
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:27,240
Speaker 0: They could maybe figure it out and some of them would probably get to be in your favor.

790
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:34,736
Speaker 1: But then again if remember they if they don't understand the issue Then someone on the opposite side will give an equally valid sounding argument against you.

791
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:37,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true but I think that you know you could.

792
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,266
Speaker 0: it's a much better chance of Winning an argument about.

793
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:44,220
Speaker 0: is this promoting the useful arts and sciences then winning the argument?

794
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:46,588
Speaker 0: Is this limiting and I think clearly.

795
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:58,420
Speaker 0: here we have a situation where Martin Luther King that is estates Aggressive, you know enforcement of their copyrights is actually not doing the opposite of promoting useful arts and sciences.

796
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:03,580
Speaker 0: It is removing Martin Luther King a very important and beloved person from the popular culture.

797
00:58:04,082 --> 00:58:09,800
Speaker 0: It is preventing people from being creative and using his likeness to create new arts and sciences.

798
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:23,739
Speaker 0: It's actually causing an overall decrease in The promotion of useful arts and sciences and you could demonstrate that you know just by showing look There've been more, you know, all these things pulled off a YouTube were useful arts and now they're gone because of this thing.

799
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:27,033
Speaker 0: yet Them themselves are not, you know doing an equal.

800
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:32,257
Speaker 0: so in some, you know This is demoting useful arts and sciences and therefore no good.

801
00:58:33,902 --> 00:58:36,474
Speaker 0: No one's made that argument as far as I know not a lawyer.

802
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:39,807
Speaker 1: I'm kind of hungry Before we wrap this up.

803
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:42,280
Speaker 1: I do want to point out and we're gonna talk more about this.

804
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:53,640
Speaker 1: We're gonna make a little audio bit or something about it whenever we get a chance but there'll be a link in this post to a post in our forum, but The long story short is that a very good friend of ours a member of the front row crew is now a teacher.

805
00:58:54,306 --> 00:59:00,979
Speaker 1: The school does not have enough books in their library for like kindergarten through third graders.

806
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:03,720
Speaker 0: Do we have any kindergarten through third grade books?

807
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:14,680
Speaker 1: So what we are asking what we are putting out to you if anyone is interested in helping these kids out in this school Where they're soliciting donations for chapter, but earlier I'll read a quote.

808
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:24,679
Speaker 1: We need books that are appropriate for grades K through 3 early readers stuff picture books graphic novels like owly for instance Easy chapter books DVDs CDs audiobooks, etc.

809
00:59:25,382 --> 00:59:33,046
Speaker 1: Any books that speak to about minorities and other cultures are a big plus since we want the library's contest because versus for students population Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

810
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:39,030
Speaker 1: if you're interested at all and helping these kids There's an address linked to in the forum.

811
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,134
Speaker 1: You can send these books.

812
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:41,860
Speaker 1: They will be much much appreciated.

813
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:46,735
Speaker 0: Man that's always so weird Just like that like schools today like don't have libraries and I was a kid.

814
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:54,260
Speaker 0: my elementary school Had a big-ass library middle school big-ass library high school double big-ass library and there were two town libraries.

815
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,770
Speaker 0: He had so many fucking libraries.

816
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:05,873
Speaker 0: every freaking school, you know and sure the elementary school had older books and the middle school had a little bit newer and the high school had newer and Then school had a gigantic library that I don't think any students ever used.

817
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:07,900
Speaker 1: we had a card catalog.

818
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:10,420
Speaker 0: Well, we had card catalogs in every library, you know.

819
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,448
Speaker 0: That was only slowly replaced with computers.

820
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:15,260
Speaker 0: now dial in dial in directly my modem.

821
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,038
Speaker 0: I'd call the library's modem on the phone and search the library to see what books are there.

822
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:30,399
Speaker 1: in middle school we had a multimedia server that had 20 CD drives in it and You could access multimedia stuff anywhere in the school from that one server.

823
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:33,756
Speaker 1: Except more than two people used it at once it totally slowed down and stopped working.

824
01:00:33,816 --> 01:00:34,379
Speaker 0: But yeah.

825
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,140
Speaker 1: But actually, you know, I'll read the whole thing.

826
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:44,240
Speaker 1: As some of you know I recently started teaching kindergarten third grade art at a charter school in the Albany New York area.

827
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:49,740
Speaker 1: The school is an entity as an entity several years old and moved into its brand new building in August.

828
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:53,599
Speaker 1: The upside is that the facility is amazing and the students and teachers love it.

829
01:00:54,101 --> 01:01:01,364
Speaker 1: I even have an LCD projector that is mounted on my ceiling so that I can show images from the computer via plugs in the On my desk.

830
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:02,348
Speaker 0: RIT styling.

831
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:05,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, we were really spoiled going to RIT.

832
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:12,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, the hell is at RIT, right when you're just RIT student and RIT is the only place you ever, you know Gone to college right you go.

833
01:01:12,348 --> 01:01:13,172
Speaker 0: Oh man RIT.

834
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:13,915
Speaker 0: It's all bricks.

835
01:01:13,955 --> 01:01:14,377
Speaker 0: It's ugly.

836
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:15,100
Speaker 0: It sucks, right?

837
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,180
Speaker 1: Every single classroom had a gigantic perfect projector.

838
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:24,269
Speaker 1: We had Elmo's and like all the really oh my god Like the facilities of like all this technology everywhere.

839
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,743
Speaker 0: and it's like not until you go to like a state school Do you realize?

840
01:01:27,824 --> 01:01:29,352
Speaker 0: wow, you don't have anything.

841
01:01:29,392 --> 01:01:30,920
Speaker 0: it's like you have one projector for the college.

842
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:32,326
Speaker 1: I would at IBM.

843
01:01:32,346 --> 01:01:35,720
Speaker 1: I remember my first day on the job at IBM and I went to this big meeting.

844
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:37,160
Speaker 1: It was like yeah come to this meeting.

845
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,106
Speaker 1: It's like the monthly blah blah blah meeting and it's important but you can kind of get a feel for all the stuff we're working on.

846
01:01:42,752 --> 01:01:47,349
Speaker 1: and they had a Transparency projector and that was it.

847
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:48,693
Speaker 0: RIT didn't have any of those.

848
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:49,797
Speaker 1: I know we had Elmo's.

849
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:50,118
Speaker 1: Yeah.

850
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:51,122
Speaker 1: Oh my god We're almost.

851
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:54,960
Speaker 0: I guess some teach I guess like maybe one or two teachers had the transparency but not you know.

852
01:01:55,702 --> 01:02:01,440
Speaker 1: You know, it might be worth it to buy an Elmo because think about the things we could do at panels with an Elmo.

853
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:02,345
Speaker 0: It's all you.

854
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:14,502
Speaker 1: I'll see how much money they are Anyway, and it's skip skip skip which has been used in projects regarding owly Dragons and textures on them and Kiki's delivery service Mm-hmm.

855
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:22,279
Speaker 1: the downsides that when they left the old building that they shared with another's charter school with whom they were affiliated They left the library behind.

856
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:24,767
Speaker 0: So then why didn't they bring the library?

857
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:27,036
Speaker 1: because the other school it was the other schools library.

858
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:27,840
Speaker 1: they couldn't just take it.

859
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:29,128
Speaker 0: Oh, I get it.

860
01:02:29,289 --> 01:02:37,300
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna say this While it would be funny to send them a road sick of doji Do not send them a road sick of dough.

861
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:44,590
Speaker 0: Why don't they just you know sort of like save up a you know, a bunch of money and solicit donations and then just buy You know the penguin classics collection.

862
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,494
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

863
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:46,640
Speaker 0: It's just instant library.

864
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:55,346
Speaker 0: Of course elementary school kids couldn't read any of those hard real books, but you know, all right Instant library say if you have Donations send them here.

865
01:02:55,947 --> 01:03:03,820
Speaker 1: if you want to do a separate donation drive to buy the penguin books collection for some other school in The future that's a really good idea and we'll do that later.

866
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:10,717
Speaker 1: But for now send books for kindergarten through third graders that do not involve over fiends to the address linked to in the forum.

867
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:12,705
Speaker 1: I Swear to God.

868
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:15,240
Speaker 1: if any of you send them a road sick of doji, I'm gonna cry.

869
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:22,359
Speaker 0: Realize you send them a road sick of doji They're just not gonna give it to the school and we're basically getting free copies of a road sick of doji for us.

870
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,446
Speaker 0: Yes, in fact, is there a neurosica?

871
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:25,068
Speaker 0: doji manga?

872
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:25,850
Speaker 0: Yes.

873
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:28,037
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, by the way, I've read it.

01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:29,821
Speaker 0: the cheapest Elmo's $692.

875
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:32,149
Speaker 1: that's less than I expected.

876
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:33,534
Speaker 0: That's that's the cheapest one.

877
01:03:33,554 --> 01:03:35,099
Speaker 0: that basically does like jack and shit.

878
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:37,547
Speaker 0: It's a camera on a stick.

879
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:38,971
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how?

880
01:03:38,991 --> 01:03:40,336
Speaker 1: how far have Elmo's come?

Speaker 1: Alright, he was a long time ago.

882
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,715
Speaker 0: It's basically this is the cheapest one is a camera on a stick and then a surface to put your stuff on.

883
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:54,055
Speaker 0: the fancy Elmo's Right the like are very very expensive like $3,000, but they have many many fancy features.

884
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,620

Speaker 0: the fancy one is a built-in monitor.

888
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:10,464
Speaker 1: I feel like an Elmo at a gaming con at some sort of like burning wheel panel would be boss Maybe.

889
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:11,971
Speaker 0: yeah, they're definitely good for gaming things.

890
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:16,380
Speaker 1: Alright, you know, they'd be really good If I was running a game like show someone how to play a board game.

891
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:24,886
Speaker 0: we could just put the board game on the Elmo and then Of course, you know, we could just put a webcam on a stick for like 40 bucks Yeah, and then no reason to buy the Elmo.

892
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:25,829
Speaker 1: actually we should.
