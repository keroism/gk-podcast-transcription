27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,598
Speaker 1: Like hey, it was yeah, I mean I gave him the first two volumes of one punch man manga.

Speaker 1: It's.

30
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,880
Speaker 1: it's almost the same as the anime.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:32,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless the only thing is the review of like the holistic beginning and like if I reviewed project blue cheek you based on the first Episode triple-a best show ever but based on the whole show.

32
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:36,692

56
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,443
Speaker 0: I'm kind of into this Business.

57
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,131
Speaker 1: here is something interesting for you.

58
00:03:53,292 --> 00:04:01,387
Speaker 1: By the way, there will be an episode this season of Adventure Time that was partially starboarded by Casey Green and someone else.

59
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:03,575
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm surprised.

60
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:06,349
Speaker 0: I didn't know that was happening I just tweeted it today.

61
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,820
Speaker 1: Like when I left work, I saw that tweet.

62
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:11,720
Speaker 0: Oh, I follow him on Twitter, but I have not looked at Twitter a little bit cuz I was actually doing work at work.

63
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:12,383
Speaker 1: That's right.

64
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,773
Speaker 1: Maybe the dick butt will appear.

65
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,439
Speaker 0: Oh, it has to.

66
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:31,773
Speaker 0: So in the news We don't pay like a lot of like little anime cons or even like mid-sized anime cons and fan conventions in general come and go and some of them ask us to attend and we really usually don't because we're busy.

67
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,318
Speaker 0: a lot of reasons why we don't always go.

68
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:43,153
Speaker 0: but There was one anime convention that I had not ever heard of Until this story the Akiba Expo.

69
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,940
Speaker 1: All right, it sounds like a normal anime con.

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,802
Speaker 1: So where is it?

71
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,370
Speaker 0: I guess it's in Anaheim, California.

72
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,078
Speaker 1: They already have anime Expo like out there in California.

73
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:51,660
Speaker 1: Why do they need?

74
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,303
Speaker 0: Well, I was gonna.

75
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:57,100
Speaker 0: I could go to the Akiba Expo website to tell you exactly when it was.

76
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,188
Speaker 0: I think it was in December, but it might have been in February.

77
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,257
Speaker 0: Like I don't know because coming up soon.

78
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:04,390
Speaker 1: It's gone All right, so it's an anime con that failed.

79
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,616
Speaker 1: exciting not news.

80
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:06,419
Speaker 1: This happens all the time.

81
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:14,860
Speaker 0: What's interesting is that this is By no means the first time that this has happened in very recent memory, but happens all the time.

82
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:22,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, but most people don't seem to realize this because from what I can gather Thousands of people bought badges.

83
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,038
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

84
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:27,132
Speaker 1: Yeah Why would you buy some badges some shady con that you've never ever heard of?

85
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,035
Speaker 0: see that's.

86
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,720
Speaker 0: I followed up on all these stores.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,567
Speaker 1: It was like there was a convention in New York.

88
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,333
Speaker 1: Actually, I think was when we were at PAX.

89
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,160
Speaker 1: Yeah called waka con.

90
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:45,520
Speaker 1: They supposed to be the Brooklyn Expo Center, yeah a place I wanted to check out but I Did not have anything to do with that because I was like, wow, this is totally shady.

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,473
Speaker 1: But apparently it happened and it was somewhat legit.

92
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,540
Speaker 1: So maybe I'll go to it.

93
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:48,782
Speaker 1: No,

94
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,860
Speaker 0: so not only did apparently thousands of people registered But

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,649
Speaker 1: I was so scab of a con I never heard of before get

96
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:02,820
Speaker 0: hotel rooms for it post about how excited they are That they're gonna be at it, but they bought a hundred and sixty dollar artist alley tables.

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,957
Speaker 0: Wow, no one's getting their money back, I don't think anyone's get their money back.

98
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:07,420
Speaker 1: that's a shame.

99
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:13,292
Speaker 0: So this you know, like there was that minecraft con that was the same thing Like the people who ran it gonna get busted for fraud.

100
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:14,679
Speaker 0: They're gone as far as I can tell.

101
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,408
Speaker 1: Why don't we fraud and run away?

102
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:17,635
Speaker 0: That's what I was talking about.

103
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 0: Are you so Scott?

Speaker 1: We can professional conference fraud where the tickets are a thousand dollars.

109
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:30,665
Speaker 0: So the I've got Harry Potter Avengers con.

110
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:31,650
Speaker 0: that's my con.

111
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:32,774
Speaker 1: That's the convention.

112
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:36,485
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make as much money as Wait till you see our guests.

Speaker 0: Actually, I've got John Oliver to host the cosplay.

120
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,740
Speaker 0: All right, so he's gonna be the speaker of the cosplay.

121
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:55,407
Speaker 0: We're gonna have a rave.

122
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,280
Speaker 0: at least 10,000 people can go to this rave.

123
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:04,440
Speaker 0: We've got to mix Megumi Hashibara and every single kpop band.

124
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:08,877
Speaker 0: Every single one every one every all of them, you know how many there are.

125
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:13,251
Speaker 1: Take like a week just to hear one song from each of them.

126
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,380
Speaker 0: I assume there's actually an infinite number.

127
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,516
Speaker 0: It's like one of those functions where RNG just keeps popping up new band names.

128
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:21,529
Speaker 1: the deeper you go I think somebody some at some point.

129
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,331
Speaker 1: someone said there's like hundreds of idols in Kpop.

130
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:30,145
Speaker 0: so That minecraft convention.

131
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:40,422
Speaker 0: like people a lot of people were pretty sure it was BS from the beginning Even though at the same time tons of people like paid and try to go to it or whatever - con.

132
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:44,680
Speaker 0: the entire internet knew it was gonna be a disaster, but yet somehow people showed up to it.

133
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:47,011
Speaker 1: But this one isn't even gonna happen.

134
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:54,269
Speaker 0: the time between the internet saying hey Is this convention a scam?

135
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,020
Speaker 0: - it imploding was like two days.

136
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:58,802
Speaker 1: Wait, why not?

137
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:01,451
Speaker 1: Just if you're scamming and someone finds you out.

138
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:02,394
Speaker 1: Why are you running away?

139
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:03,899
Speaker 1: Why don't you just keep taking money?

140
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,067
Speaker 1: So and say you're not a scam until the last possible.

141
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:10,317
Speaker 0: I put even odds on one of two possibilities.

142
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:12,528
Speaker 0: This is my guess Possibility one.

143
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:20,778
Speaker 0: it was a scam from the beginning But the person running it got funding from someone else and I've heard some rumors about that.

144
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,464
Speaker 0: might be how they Actually got this thing going.

145
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:26,800
Speaker 0: Whoa squandered all that money and put together a best effort that was designed to fail.

146
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,415
Speaker 0: So we can't easily be sued because it's not really illegal to fail.

147
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,440
Speaker 0: It's illegal to fraud.

148
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:35,355
Speaker 1: So if you try how did this person get funding for an anime con?

149
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,500
Speaker 1: who's funding anime cons?

150
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,768
Speaker 1: I will put it on a real fucking anime con.

151
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,996
Speaker 1: that will totally legit happen not fraud.

152
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:47,290
Speaker 1: if you fund me Someone funds me to run an anime con I will run a kick-ass anime con somewhere.

153
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:56,338
Speaker 1: if you fund me say I don't have to go to my regular job The packs of anime cons The best fucking con will start small the first year, but we're gonna.

154
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,850
Speaker 1: you know We won't spend all your money and then we're gonna use.

155
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,613
Speaker 1: we're gonna profit.

156
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:01,120
Speaker 0: for sure wouldn't even need that much.

157
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:09,355
Speaker 1: You know we need and we're gonna kick ass year after year and we're gonna build that up and within like the third year It'll be like we'll be getting ready to like almost compete with anime Boston.

158
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,818
Speaker 1: I would need like 300 K tops sure Oh plus enough to live.

159
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:16,616
Speaker 0: Well, yeah plus anyway.

160
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,578
Speaker 0: But so basically this threat appeared on 4chan.

161
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:25,494
Speaker 0: and Is anyone planning on attending Akiba Expo?

162
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,780
Speaker 0: It's a first-year con in Anaheim.

163
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:28,860
Speaker 0: I wanted to go since 20 even drive in my house.

164
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:33,956
Speaker 0: But I'm double thinking it because there's been some shady business practices and drama surrounding the event.

165
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,040
Speaker 1: don't double think it.

166
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,565
Speaker 1: You only need to think once shady.

167
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:36,766
Speaker 1: Nope.

168
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:39,033
Speaker 1: That's the one half a thing.

169
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:39,615
Speaker 1: It's like what.

170
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:40,659
Speaker 1: there's something shady about this?

171
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:48,080
Speaker 0: nope Yep Capitals no Anna Twitter Started looking at this con because they noticed it because people started talking about it a little bit.

172
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:52,419
Speaker 0: So I went and looked at the hashtags and it was all people talking about how excited they were to go.

173
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,848
Speaker 0: And in fact, they're still talking about it.

174
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:58,420
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people attending this con don't know that it's gone.

175
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:03,473
Speaker 0: I'll bet people are going to show up in Anaheim because apparently they mailed their badges.

176
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:13,558
Speaker 0: people tweeted pictures their fucking badges Oh snap, so someone did something that wasn't complete A lot but from what I can gather they posted a lineup of guests and then one by one to get.

177
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:18,860
Speaker 0: the people who were Listed were like, uh, I'm not I didn't say I was attending that con.

178
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,472
Speaker 0: Supposedly someone who was trying to staff the con with guest relations Leaked a bunch of emails and was like yo dog.

179
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,999
Speaker 0: This shit is not happening.

180
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:34,216
Speaker 1: All this all why don't you just contact the space that it's supposed to be in?

181
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,200
Speaker 1: so that was the other thing.

182
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,540
Speaker 0: No one was sure where it was because it was implied it doesn't have a location.

183
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,760
Speaker 0: It was implied that was at some convention center and all the convention center.

184
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,503
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah people.

185
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:49,860
Speaker 0: so once Anna Twitter pointed at this someone pointed out immediately like yeah That event is not listed on the Anaheim Convention Center.

186
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,960
Speaker 0: And then someone else said that oh, it looks like they're actually at just this hotel called the hotel in Anaheim.

187
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:59,455
Speaker 0: So yeah, so those investigations began like real.

188
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:00,137
Speaker 0: recently.

189
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,913
Speaker 1: like this went this How long is this convention been taking people's money?

190
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,304
Speaker 0: Apparently a long time For a while.

191
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,735
Speaker 0: so the the Facebook page went from.

192
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,959
Speaker 0: we're not a scam to.

193
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:11,865
Speaker 0: the event is canceled.

194
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:13,871
Speaker 0: their official website went from.

195
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:30,560
Speaker 0: it looks like some general generic Squarespace site with The convention rules and policies which I should you not were a copy/paste of a rave Rules because it had all this shit about rave nonsense and how big your totems can be and totems.

196
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a reaver thing.

197
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:34,115
Speaker 0: they bring these big totem poles and wave them around.

198
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,521
Speaker 0: it's the stupidest They don't.

199
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,304
Speaker 1: I never heard of this.

200
00:11:36,685 --> 00:11:36,946
Speaker 0: ray.

201
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,435
Speaker 0: go go go to a rave and read their rules.

202
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:45,860
Speaker 0: You were not allowed to bring Professional video or camera equipment which included anything with the detachable lens, okay?

203
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,100
Speaker 0: You could not bring over-the-counter medicine of any kind or prescription medicine of any kind.

204
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,626
Speaker 1: But the raves are full of drugs.

205
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:54,473
Speaker 1: you are everyone brings them in.

206
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,724
Speaker 1: so I don't think these rules are being enforced very well I don't know.

207
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:57,834
Speaker 0: I don't go to a lot of raves.

208
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:04,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Yeah, so it was really if you told me there was actually a rave that didn't have any drugs going on at it.

209
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:04,358
Speaker 1: like.

210
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,005
Speaker 1: I'm Not gonna be in a cloud of smoke.

211
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,154
Speaker 1: I mean I like electronic music.

212
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,640
Speaker 1: I would totally go and have a dance.

213
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,840
Speaker 0: You want to go to a straight-edge rave?

214
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,367
Speaker 0: I know of a few in New York City.

215
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,152
Speaker 1: is it gonna be huge?

216
00:12:15,172 --> 00:12:16,440
Speaker 1: and is the good DJ gonna be there?

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,025
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be there just DJ.

218
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,149
Speaker 0: They're just straight edge.

219
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,160
Speaker 0: They're all like Henry Rollins fans going to these things okay?

220
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good time.

221
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:24,479
Speaker 0: There's also quiet events.

222
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:30,360
Speaker 0: They do raves that are big and giant, but they everyone gets headphones and the music's all just in the headphones.

223
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:31,411
Speaker 1: I don't like that now.

224
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,038
Speaker 0: You don't like that?

225
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,316
Speaker 0: no That's not good, but do you want to like roll around in bubbles and get high on ecstasy?

226
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:35,437
Speaker 0: like?

227
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:47,720
Speaker 1: no I want there to be just a dance party where it's music only and it's legit dancing But the soap you know electronic music It's not a rave with drugs and all sorts of weird light stick people, but normal people.

228
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,106
Speaker 0: Here's the there's.

229
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:57,078
Speaker 0: what happened here with Akiva Expo Brings up a lot of interesting points that may or may not be worth further discussion not now, but in the future.

230
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,878
Speaker 0: one Who are these people who see a website for a convention and without?

231
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,399
Speaker 0: Looking at any other part of the internet type their parents credit card number in and rent a hotel room.

232
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,720
Speaker 0: Who are these people who are still dateline now?

233
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,031
Speaker 0: Tweeting about the con not knowing that it's gone.

234
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:19,260
Speaker 0: I found a tweet where someone's like oh looks like the websites down.

235
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,345
Speaker 0: Hopefully, it'll be back soon.

236
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:21,913
Speaker 0: I wanted something something artist alley.

237
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:28,900
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, dude I Think what if someone on an administrator was gonna has a gofundme?

238
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,646
Speaker 0: He was like I will fucking legit.

239
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,716
Speaker 0: go to this thing and live tweet the entire convention if you send me there.

240
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:39,200
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, yeah, so I wonder if you go tweeting from outside the convey the hotel.

241
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:47,263
Speaker 1: I wonder if he's gonna go anyway And just see like an interview these people who show up thinking there's gonna be a convention when they're all their badges And there isn't anything there.

242
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:59,974
Speaker 0: uh there is such demand for anime cons that Pretty much any first-year con seems to sell out almost anywhere Which is actually kind of I can't imagine this comm is gonna be that big in the hotel.

243
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:04,072
Speaker 0: well according to the website It's gonna be the fucking biggest thing you've ever seen.

244
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,640
Speaker 0: you should have seen what was on this website.

245
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:15,264
Speaker 0: People are posting Google caches of what the website looked like but the most beautiful thing in the world my favorite Thing mm-hmm.

246
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,548
Speaker 0: I gotta pull it off here.

247
00:14:16,568 --> 00:14:29,588
Speaker 0: doo doo doo doo good night, so Sans Duvall tweeted good night sweet prince ten hours ago, and it is a screenshot of Where they announced.

248
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,260
Speaker 0: the convention is no longer happening.

249
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:34,029
Speaker 0: They didn't announce another website because that shit's gone.

250
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,273
Speaker 0: They announced it on their website.

251
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,120
Speaker 1: probably cost money if it's Squarespace.

252
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:41,400
Speaker 0: Squarespace cost like ten bucks a month like it's not I mean if you're running away with all the money.

253
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,805
Speaker 1: You don't have ten bucks a month anymore.

254
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,671
Speaker 0: Do you to our guests and fans?

255
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,180
Speaker 0: due to the recent rumors and allegations?

256
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,767
Speaker 0: We are forced to bring Akihabara Expo to a halt.

257
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,325
Speaker 0: most of our staff have left the organization due to threats as well as distrust Of the exposition due to recent events.

258
00:14:55,766 --> 00:15:01,927
Speaker 0: without people to run the show and without the people who helped us build this we cannot execute A show that we would be proud of.

259
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:06,906
Speaker 0: in addition most of our guests have left due to the constant drama and harassment Our exposition has faced.

260
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:12,751
Speaker 0: we wish the show could go on but without proper staffing and a solid lineup We cannot bring the same quality experience that we had promised you.

261
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:16,637
Speaker 0: if you wish to receive a recent refund Please fill the form below.

262
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:20,059

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,748

00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,455
Speaker 1: I want to hear from someone who gets a refund.

265
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:28,271
Speaker 0: Oh so option two Here's my other the other 50/50 hours than what happened here.

266
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,881
Speaker 0: It is possible from some of the leaks I read of.

267
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:35,252
Speaker 0: like guests were contacted, but like weren't sent contracts, and it was all.

268
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:53,294
Speaker 0: it is possible that someone Got in over their head and thought they could run a con and somehow got a hold of enough money to like Start making a con But just didn't know what the fuck they were doing and tried to just kind of string it all along Until eventually it fell apart like a house of cards.

269
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,025
Speaker 0: hmm I give even odds.

270
00:15:55,065 --> 00:16:06,820
Speaker 0: neither one of those things whatever but this You can just search for Akiva Expo on Twitter and over the course of two days You can see this go from a hundred to zero and it's beautiful.

271
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:13,400
Speaker 1: And so in other news that actually affects people who affect a lot of people aren't stupid?

272
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,187
Speaker 1: There was some mumblings this week.

273
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,540
Speaker 1: nothing like totally confirmed or locked in or anything like that.

274
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:30,860
Speaker 1: no details, but Netflix who has been producing shows on their own as shown great interest in making anime and Bollywood.

275
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:37,900
Speaker 1: Yes, this may mean that they'll actually have a studio at Netflix that produces like Netflix original anime.

276
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:45,584
Speaker 1: Or maybe it means that like they'll hire a Japanese studio like madhouse or somebody and be like hey Here's a bunch of money.

277
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:48,234
Speaker 1: make this anime for us or who knows what.

278
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:54,380
Speaker 1: but there's gonna be Possibly some animes in the future with any you know how many months or years?

279
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,360
Speaker 1: That are only on Netflix until someone pirates them off of Netflix.

280
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,189
Speaker 0: That's a big deal for one reason.

281
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,176
Speaker 0: that reason is the number that I mean they're trying.

282
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,801
Speaker 1: are they gonna put this on Netflix in Japan?

283
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:08,059
Speaker 1: I presume to try to get Netflix to be a thing in Japan and maybe it is a thing there.

284
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,319
Speaker 0: all right I also make it global.

285
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,991
Speaker 0: But that number the reason this is a big deal is five billion.

286
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:24,249
Speaker 0: Netflix said next year alone and just in 2016 They're gonna spend five billion dollars on original content B. so Think about how.

287
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:31,975
Speaker 0: because there was that leak way back of all the like Licensing stuff and you all know all the nonsense about how little people who make anime actually get paid.

288
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:43,192
Speaker 0: if Netflix Gives even what they would consider a tiny budget to an existing anime studio like force Everyone's gonna go work at that studio all 4c.

289
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,820
Speaker 1: Definitely you got to pay them the big bucks.

290
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:47,414
Speaker 1: Well, actually that's the studio.

291
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:52,539
Speaker 1: if I was Netflix That's what I definitely would do is be like both see ghost in the shell up in the house.

292
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,346
Speaker 1: here We go, but think about this.

293
00:17:54,607 --> 00:18:02,658
Speaker 0: if Netflix gave what they would consider a small budget to an anime studio That would probably end up being the biggest budget any anime has ever had ever.

294
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,332
Speaker 1: in fact You know well Akira had a huge, but I'd be like.

295
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:05,553
Speaker 0: well.

296
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:06,016
Speaker 0: Here's a movie.

297
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:06,700
Speaker 0: You're talking about shows.

298
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, you can make movies fucking - who cares?

299
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,120
Speaker 1: yeah, I get like IG for C team up.

300
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,573
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you could just be like all star anime here.

301
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:15,894
Speaker 1: We go.

302
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,180
Speaker 1: I can just buy all your studios.

303
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,786
Speaker 1: I'm Netflix.

304
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,331
Speaker 1: you're tiny.

305
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:21,410
Speaker 0: yeah It's kind of a big deal.

306
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,600
Speaker 0: actually if this goes forward.

307
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:28,313
Speaker 1: I know right who knows whatever animes they make could be like anime of the century and couple this with the Hulu thing.

308
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:36,420
Speaker 1: and pretty much have Hulu and Netflix and Spent a lot more time talking about his news, but this news is a way bigger deal.

309
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,673
Speaker 1: There's a lot less to say about it other than holy shit.

310
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:39,276
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

311
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:39,819
Speaker 0: come on.

312
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,900
Speaker 0: Well, it does kind of relate into the actual topic of the show.

313
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:44,633
Speaker 1: Which is all you?

314
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:52,675
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

315
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:59,013
Speaker 0: so speaking of those Netflix shows one of the best ones in recent memory Bojack Horseman.

316
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:09,843
Speaker 0: Bojack is actually a super good show and if you don't know what Bojack is like you haven't seen it and You assume that it's something just based on like screenshots.

317
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:15,299
Speaker 0: You might have seen of the horseheaded guy or Maybe seeing the first episode and thinking it's like Archer or something.

318
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:15,981
Speaker 0: it is not.

319
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,687
Speaker 0: it is a human drama.

320
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:18,730
Speaker 0: It's super good.

321
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,824
Speaker 0: I highly recommend it.

322
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:26,410
Speaker 0: Emily And I like just went crazy and binged on the entire thing and now we're just waiting for the next season which is already confirmed.

323
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,396
Speaker 0: but Cartoon hangover at Frederator.

324
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:31,780
Speaker 0: they've been doing a thing recently.

325
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,790
Speaker 0: you might have seen these around a hundred and seven facts about something.

326
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:36,961
Speaker 0: These are actually super good videos.

327
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:44,241
Speaker 0: so my thing of the day is 107 Bojack Horseman facts And it's just a hundred and seven interesting things about Bojack Horseman.

328
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,086
Speaker 0: the show and it ranges from like.

329
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:47,230
Speaker 0: did you notice this thing in?

330
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:53,270
Speaker 0: Background of this one episode - did you know this guy worked out it like Michael Eisner or something something like that kind of stuff.

331
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,749
Speaker 0: it's a Fascinating and it's only like 20 minutes long.

332
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:05,000
Speaker 1: Okay, so I didn't know about this until very recently But in 2014 there was this short Toy Story movie.

333
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,967
Speaker 1: There was like 20 minutes long called Toy Story.

334
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,210
Speaker 1: that time forgot.

335
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,393
Speaker 1: All right It's a TV.

336
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:16,209
Speaker 1: I think it was on TV, but I guess there's a booray now or something.

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,130
Speaker 1: So you can watch this thing if you haven't seen it already.

338
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:25,050
Speaker 1: Apparently despite only being like 20 minutes long it took them like forever to make it because it's Toy Story level quality.

339
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,460
Speaker 1: It's like 20 minutes long.

340
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:42,730
Speaker 1: right it was a big effort And it's sort of about this story Involving like these other toys that are called like the battle sores or something and you know they don't know that their toys and the Toy Story toys at the fight with them, or you know typical typical kind of story anyway.

341
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:50,264
Speaker 1: so You know this is fictional toy within the Toy Story world known as a battle sore.

342
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,362
Speaker 1: right that is this in this short 20-minute thing.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,310
Speaker 1: now Presumably if you're a toy in the Toy Story world you also have a cartoon right?

344
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,670
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's a Buzz Lightyear cartoon that you can watch if you're in the Toy Story world.

345
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,709
Speaker 1: so there's a. Theoretically there would also be a battle source cartoon.

346
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:12,770
Speaker 1: And what would the opener of that battle source cartoon look like if it existed well here?

347
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,072
Speaker 1: It is.

348
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:19,341
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if this is actually part of that Movie the 20-minute movie or I heard.

349
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:21,790
Speaker 1: maybe this was just because I've only seen this video on YouTube.

350
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:23,577
Speaker 1: I think it was also.

351
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:37,281
Speaker 1: may have just been a special feature on the bure if you got it Right, but what this is is theoretically the opener to battle sores right the Fictional toy in the fictional Toy Story universe.

352
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:38,385
Speaker 0: I'm kind of into that.

353
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,990
Speaker 1: Why is this notable?

354
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,759
Speaker 1: Why do we care about this thing?

355
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,843
Speaker 1: it's just a cute little.

356
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,850
Speaker 1: animation is not very long right.

357
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:57,381
Speaker 1: it's like 44 seconds of animation because This 44 seconds of animation was animated by Studio trigger and therefore it is a thing of the day worthy.

358
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, that might save anime.

359
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:00,089
Speaker 0: That's right.

360
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:03,190
Speaker 0: So there you go in the meta moment.

361
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:13,969
Speaker 0: We have a patreon and you should back it listen to the show after the end of the credits because I Say the names of people back there and possibly do some dumb stuff, too.

362
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,235
Speaker 1: If you're really so foolish is to give us money.

363
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:19,620
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna tell you no, but I'm gonna be like why?

364
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:23,739
Speaker 1: Why we're using that?

365
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:24,743
Speaker 1: we have money.

366
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,030
Speaker 1: Why are you giving us money?

367
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,424
Speaker 1: well, you probably have less money than we have but you have more money than we have.

368
00:22:30,745 --> 00:22:35,220
Speaker 0: call me if Everyone who listens to geek not just based on the stats.

369
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,418
Speaker 0: I have gave us just one dollar one penny One penny one dollar a month.

370
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:43,369
Speaker 0: That's actually enough money to start funding like some cool stuff.

371
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:48,970
Speaker 0: and Also, we're gonna use this as an excuse to for real start up the you tennis show again.

372
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,613
Speaker 0: I've already been doing some pre-production and we're making a bunch of other videos and content Like we're gonna start.

373
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:57,827
Speaker 0: the bigger that patreon gets the more things other than geek nights.

374
00:22:57,847 --> 00:23:02,960
Speaker 1: We're gonna do Also, you can buy geek night t-shirts made at Amazon store.

375
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,688
Speaker 1: That's not a total waste of money, but it's still.

376
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:18,190
Speaker 0: it's Classic geek night shirt that actually we sold like a couple hundred of those things back in the day And I've hardly ever seen anyone wearing one ever Partly because we sold them a long time ago and we only go to a few cars.

377
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,436
Speaker 1: How many of you sold an Amazon?

378
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:20,742

379
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:21,486
Speaker 1: There you go.

380
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:22,370
Speaker 1: That's a good number.

381
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, well cuz we relaunch.

382
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,514
Speaker 0: what I expect now We don't have.

383
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:26,137
Speaker 0: we have class.

384
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,268

00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of those I bought.

386
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:32,985
Speaker 0: so for I bought to make sure that they were good quality.

387
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:33,567
Speaker 1: Do you have it?

388
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,879
Speaker 0: Uh No, it actually didn't arrive yet Isn't it from Amazon?

389
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,669
Speaker 1: shouldn't be here in two days?

390
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:41,870
Speaker 0: No, because apparently so many people are doing the Amazon merch thing that they're way backed up.

391
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,001
Speaker 1: Okay, but anyway, so yeah, uh, four people bought them good.

392
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:46,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, it shouldn't be a large number.

393
00:23:46,728 --> 00:23:47,290
Speaker 0: It's no case shirt.

394
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,035
Speaker 0: I like the shirt a lot.

395
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:48,418
Speaker 0: It's actually.

396
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:49,889
Speaker 0: it's a better poster, but it's pretty good shirt.

397
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you wanted to share your geek that has posters left.

398
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,310
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah somewhere forgot that we made them until just now.

399
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,180
Speaker 0: I was thinking about reprinting them because those are actually easy.

400
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,870
Speaker 0: I could have a box of posters in the apartment.

401
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:04,890
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna have a box of t-shirts across like 15 different sizes and two different colors.

402
00:24:05,412 --> 00:24:08,986
Speaker 1: We should maybe we should make our website look like those posters instead of rebrand.

403
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:11,821
Speaker 0: Ah I would actually be kind of into that.

404
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:13,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like that style a lot.

405
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,556
Speaker 0: Emily did that design right.

406
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:16,564
Speaker 0: the book club book was the Wheel of Time.

407
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:17,930
Speaker 0: we read the first book.

408
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,798
Speaker 0: You should listen to that and read the first book.

409
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,490
Speaker 0: We since read the first four books.

410
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:28,570
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a patreon backers only show of the first four books of the Wheel of Time.

411
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:30,898
Speaker 0: So you got to be giving us at least a dollar.

412
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:35,536
Speaker 0: you're not gonna hear that one unless someone pirates it which I guess I'm not gonna sue you.

413
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:38,308
Speaker 1: It'll still be Creative Commons licensed if you want to share it.

414
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,557
Speaker 0: Go ahead Yeah, but it'll only be in patreon.

415
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,724
Speaker 1: I guess we'll only link to it from there.

416
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:44,129
Speaker 1: So it's basically honor system.

417
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:49,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean because really you're dumbass if you give us money, I don't really care.

418
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:51,730
Speaker 0: I've also I've pirated things in my life.

419
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:56,226
Speaker 0: So if someone pirates my stuff, I have basically no ground to stand on At all.

420
00:24:58,274 --> 00:25:00,324
Speaker 1: You can't pirate something that's Creative Commons licensed.

421
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:01,028
Speaker 0: I am nothing.

422
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:01,931
Speaker 0: if not It's not.

423
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:06,404
Speaker 0: even if you don't if you don't give attribution, that's true motherfuckers.

424
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:11,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would be pissed if someone like You know Unattributed that would be like.

425
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:31,050
Speaker 0: really it's like I'm like I've found like websites that have our Content occasionally like a YouTube channel that has the audio from one of our episodes with a different title Not attributing us with one view, but the audio is there which has us attributing ourselves in it.

426
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,482
Speaker 1: I guess if they ripped out us saying who we were and put it in something else.

427
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:36,345
Speaker 1: That would be weird.

428
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:37,488
Speaker 0: Yeah extra weird.

429
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:41,015
Speaker 0: Yeah Luckily, we're pretty We've done a lot.

430
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,406
Speaker 0: So it'd be really hard to pretend you were us at this point.

431
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:43,788
Speaker 1: Sure.

432
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:49,522
Speaker 0: And last but not least we are going to be at magfest Without me going to magfest.

433
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:53,990
Speaker 0: I'm gonna continue to sort that out But we're gonna be at a bunch of panels and probably do one or two lectures.

434
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,516
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

435
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,565
Speaker 1: I'm mostly just gonna play games at magfest.

436
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:58,790
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah my modus operandi.

437
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,060
Speaker 1: We should organize some of like our own tournament.

438
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,522
Speaker 1: We should I?

439
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:05,800
Speaker 1: we should either do magical drop or You know Star Wars.

440
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,650
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you want to do some for real tournaments?

441
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,913
Speaker 0: Yes among us and ours because other than that and doing panels my modus operandi is getting space war Way way.

442
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,079
Speaker 0: Oh, we're gonna play a shit ton of space war.

443
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:26,750
Speaker 0: I tend to get way drunk at magfest wander around playing arcade games That's and at least one Eclipse game we should come up with like a point system.

444
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:35,669
Speaker 1: It's like, you know like this game of settlers is worth ten points for the winner and so and no points for anyone else and so on and then Keep score for all of magfest.

445
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:36,502
Speaker 0: We will.

446
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:39,806
Speaker 1: if we're gonna do that We should make like a good and then we can declare a winner of magfest.

447
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:42,599
Speaker 0: in the very least We should make a Google form because people who for people

448
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,990
Speaker 1: entering the game that they played who played who won

449
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:46,032
Speaker 0: exactly Cuz then

450
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:48,583
Speaker 1: I really need to know is game played who was in it and who won

451
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:57,687
Speaker 0: and that way we can after the fact Sit down and figure stuff out like alright Scott won like 50 games a wizard, but Rim won the Eclipse game.

452
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:02,749
Speaker 1: And we can also do stuff like play dig-dug whenever you feel like.

453
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:07,610
Speaker 1: Post your high score for the weekend and then we can see who is the best at dig-dug over there.

454
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,064
Speaker 0: I almost kind of want to start a subterfuge game like three days before magfest.

455
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:14,090
Speaker 1: No, I don't think I'm gonna play subterfuge again.

456
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,864
Speaker 1: It's just too time-consuming and distracting.

457
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:22,554
Speaker 1: It's a good game But it's just like it eats your whole life and all your attention and it sort of messes up everything else in your life while You're playing one.

458
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:24,630
Speaker 0: There was a one moment where I remember I was laying in bed.

459
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,270
Speaker 0: I was looking at subterfuge and I could see that Andrew was online.

460
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:32,164
Speaker 1: I turned off the notifications for the last two days and that was great cuz.

461
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,870
Speaker 1: I only checked it like twice a day And he didn't mess my life up anymore.

462
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:40,230
Speaker 1: But I really couldn't do anything much and I'd open it up and be like, oh look at all the shit that happened.

463
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,852
Speaker 1: Fuck me.

464
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:42,718
Speaker 1: You couldn't win doing it like that.

465
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,361
Speaker 0: Yeah.

466
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:44,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

467
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:54,237
Speaker 0: Well you you mr Literally everyone told me that you tried to make an alliance of everyone against rim immediately But that's neither here nor there.

468
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:55,765
Speaker 0: That's geek nights Tuesdays.

469
00:27:55,846 --> 00:28:00,020
Speaker 0: This is geek nights Wednesdays, so I don't know how long this will actually be.

470
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:05,390
Speaker 1: but this topic is something that He thought it was a good idea for a show and I have nothing to say.

471
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,161
Speaker 0: I didn't have a better idea for a show.

472
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:08,590
Speaker 1: You know, I have better ideas for shows.

473
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,370
Speaker 1: You just haven't read or watched any of the things that are better ideas for shit.

474
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,510
Speaker 0: You haven't read or watched any of the things that I also have better ideas for show.

475
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:16,470
Speaker 0: So that's the problem.

476
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:22,170
Speaker 0: We I guess we'd go to the Dave and Joel format of we watch completely separate things and review them separately next to each other.

477
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,281
Speaker 1: But I just gave the things that I just read.

478
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:25,307
Speaker 1: I just gave to you to read.

479
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,521
Speaker 0: you're gonna read them I'm gonna read them then we'll do the thing on them.

480
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:33,200
Speaker 0: So but so Recently, I've decided that I'm gonna change the way.

481
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,530
Speaker 0: I talk about something very specific and that is anime and manga.

482
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:46,844
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna use the word manga anymore and I'm at all Pretty much, I'm not gonna use the words anime and manga when I talk about this stuff

483
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,468
Speaker 1: because you just did yeah

484
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,389
Speaker 0: and I'm trying I'm gonna try to break away from that because I don't think calling something anime

485
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:54,469
Speaker 1: and

486
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:02,070
Speaker 0: Meaning that it is Japanese animation made in Japan is a worthwhile distinction anymore.

487
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:02,932
Speaker 1: I don't care.

488
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:04,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that that's it.

489
00:29:04,317 --> 00:29:04,798
Speaker 0: I don't care.

490
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:08,449
Speaker 1: I mean, it's useful to me because you know that it makes the.

491
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,590
Speaker 1: It makes like when I'm searching for a show to watch.

492
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,590
Speaker 1: It makes a lot more organized if that's separated out the animes from the not animes.

493
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:15,811
Speaker 1: But

494
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:20,109
Speaker 0: the majority of the animation I watch is not anime and in a lot of the rest of the world

495
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,934
Speaker 1: for me It is and

496
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:28,076
Speaker 0: in a lot of the rest of the world as we've often done It talked about in our panels like in Italy Anime, they call Adventure Time.

497
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:30,865
Speaker 0: anime just means animation usually foreign animation.

498
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:34,050
Speaker 1: So Sailor Moon fan subs I don't think there's too much Italian animation.

499
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,204
Speaker 1: I mean, there's got to be some.

500
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:36,092
Speaker 1: but yeah I've never heard.

501
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:39,067
Speaker 0: but Sailor Moon fan subs are next to like that you want.

502
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:42,510
Speaker 1: if you have you know The awesome Italian animation hook me up because I want to see it.

503
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,602
Speaker 1: In fact the same goes if you know the best animations from any country.

504
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:51,135
Speaker 1: that isn't Japan the United States France or Ireland or Russia.

505
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:52,299
Speaker 1: Those are all the countries.

506
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:53,863
Speaker 1: I've seen good animations from.

507
00:29:54,265 --> 00:29:56,913
Speaker 1: if you have good animations from other countries I know they exist.

508
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,679
Speaker 1: Please tell me I want to watch them.

509
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,344
Speaker 0: but so answer man.

510
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,459
Speaker 1: actually today Canada Canadian I was also.

511
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:04,184
Speaker 1: I've seen their enemy.

512
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of animation.

513
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

514
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:17,330
Speaker 0: so answer man today actually because I read this earlier has an article that was sort of got me thinking about this concept and the Question was you should read answer man, by the way, if you're an anime fan, I'm gonna keep saying anime.

515
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,396
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna mean something.

516
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,449
Speaker 0: I can't stop saying anime.

517
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,557
Speaker 0: The Christopher asked the answer.

518
00:30:23,597 --> 00:30:31,290
Speaker 0: man with the anime otaku industry being a fairly robust fandom in the West I was wondering is that mirrored for Western animation cartoons over in Japan?

519
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:35,750
Speaker 1: Well, we Emily's told us that they have Cartoon Network in Japan and the dubs are really good.

520
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I've seen some Dexter's lab Japanese and man the dub is really good?

521
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:40,731
Speaker 0: Yeah it is.

522
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:51,405
Speaker 0: but are there groups that work on fan subbing episodes of things like you see the universe or No, because they just have dubs of everything on their real TV like Simpson like they know.

523
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,790
Speaker 1: Simpsons are everywhere in the world.

524
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:53,927
Speaker 1: It's not like you know.

525
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,761
Speaker 0: But he but the question card you never chose.

526
00:30:56,782 --> 00:30:57,866
Speaker 1: everywhere in the world Disney shows.

527
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,830
Speaker 0: everywhere in the world Is there a fan culture like we have in the u.s.

528
00:31:02,412 --> 00:31:07,229
Speaker 0: And his answer is something that I've seen mirrored in other places and echoed around the world is that?

529
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:17,441
Speaker 0: no It's pretty much only Americans that go like apeshit and weird about anime fandom Like anime fandom being its own things separate in the u.s.

530
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,750
Speaker 0: Fandom of animation specifically and only from Japan.

531
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:24,010
Speaker 0: That doesn't really happen everywhere else.

532
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:28,990
Speaker 0: It's just America that does this to the degree that it does because a community arose, right?

533
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,447
Speaker 1: It's it's because the history right is.

534
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:34,307
Speaker 0: there was You know World War two, right?

535
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:45,301
Speaker 0: Well band military brats and military servicemen coming back to the States having watched a bunch of anime while they were stationed there Right and they formed a communities in the United States to watch this stuff.

536
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:52,143
Speaker 1: Whereas other countries say, I don't know like France It's like they didn't get the anime as early as we did.

537
00:31:52,183 --> 00:31:54,150
Speaker 1: there wasn't a community there formed around it.

538
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,486
Speaker 1: They got it when it started being exported.

539
00:31:56,526 --> 00:32:00,422
Speaker 1: the same way It's being exported now and it was just to everyone at once.

540
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:02,570
Speaker 1: suddenly, you know, they went from zero to hero.

541
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:08,145
Speaker 1: we had this in-between part where there was a this, you know society built around it and the.

542
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:17,899
Speaker 1: the current anime culture in the United States is simply the enlargement and you know Evolution of that original community that did not exist elsewhere

543
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:35,590
Speaker 0: notice the primary complaint from anime fans who actually care about anime specifically from Japan when it comes to fan culture that the fan culture of anime in the US is if you Look at the convention scene the forum scene anything like that has expanded to include pretty much all.

544
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,790
Speaker 0: Animation like Steven Universe stuff was is one of the biggest cosplays at anime cons in the u.s.

545
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:49,905
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing is talked about because a lot of the people now who happen to like anime they are not Originally coming from that, you know community.

546
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:56,670
Speaker 1: They're coming it You know, they're just fans of animation who are coming into the community from the outside to go to the convention.

547
00:32:57,232 --> 00:33:01,710
Speaker 1: So imagine they didn't grow from you know, a fan sub place, you know.

548
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:17,066
Speaker 0: imagine anime fan conventions in a world where that generic outside influence never came in and Anime cons would basically be identical to like Star Trek cons and sci-fi cons the deep

549
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:17,488
Speaker 1: some of them

550
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:31,057
Speaker 0: are yeah Deeply insular kind of like really outside of mainstream culture kind of weird and kind of inaccessible to outsiders, but instead anime cons became animation comic

551
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:31,680
Speaker 1: cons

552
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:47,910
Speaker 0: in a super general sense and I actually realized something and I hadn't thought about before because for a while like I've vacillated between Anime cons should probably focus on anime and let generic conventions like kinetic on be the fans of whatever conventions.

553
00:33:48,970 --> 00:34:03,806
Speaker 0: But in that world there is almost no reason to have an anime con anymore at all Like even less of a reason than have sci-fi cons because there's so few Actual anime that would come out where someone would have interesting content to present.

554
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:04,970
Speaker 0: like there's no reason to have a panel.

555
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:06,947
Speaker 0: How many times can you talk about Evangelion?

556
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:15,790
Speaker 1: Hmm I mean the reason the conventions existed in the u.s In the first place was in order to like copy all your fan sub tapes with other people.

557
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,976
Speaker 1: Yep, right, so we don't need to do that anymore.

558
00:34:18,318 --> 00:34:18,920
Speaker 1: And then it was.

559
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:22,981
Speaker 1: well, even though we have you know, anime available It's not widely available.

560
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:23,869
Speaker 1: We'll screen it here.

561
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:27,844
Speaker 1: Well now you can just watch it on Hulu all of it and and then it was.

562
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,370
Speaker 0: this is a niche fandom.

563
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:37,670
Speaker 0: so if you want like lit crit or Analysis or like lectures or like academic interesting content anime consoles where was that?

564
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,853
Speaker 0: like you'd go see Fred Schott.

565
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:39,274
Speaker 0: reason

566
00:34:39,293 --> 00:35:00,799
Speaker 1: for an anime condom exist is for anime fans to get together and be with each other and have a good time and Cosplay because you can't really do that anywhere or take pictures of cosplay and do other fun events that you can't do Unless you're physically with other people like maybe play some games and those sorts of things and all the other things that do happen Don't really need to happen.

567
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,171
Speaker 1: that there can just be on YouTube or you know They don't.

568
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:03,935
Speaker 1: it's like there's.

569
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:07,090
Speaker 1: no you don't need to have the con for those things to happen.

570
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,690
Speaker 1: So it's like yeah, you can have your con but it you know, and I guess that you know that you to meet guests.

571
00:35:12,871 --> 00:35:17,430
Speaker 1: Right, there are people that you can see an anime con even though people mostly seem to care about the American voice actors.

572
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,942
Speaker 1: But that's but I mean that's still a reason to go right?

573
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:20,324
Speaker 1: is this?

574
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:31,670
Speaker 1: their people will come Who oh, you know and make a public appearance and you want to enjoy their public appearance and have them entertain you and they need To be paid to do that and a con will bring up the money from all your entry fees in order to make that happen.

575
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:36,484
Speaker 0: So in the modern era why not have the Steven Universe fandom also there.

576
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,330
Speaker 0: Is there any good reason why not?

577
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,394
Speaker 1: No, I mean there was a matter.

578
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:45,150
Speaker 1: it's Pete, you know people getting together in a place to enjoy what they enjoy.

579
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:56,390
Speaker 1: So if you know there if people if all the people who enjoy say a also enjoy be like I imagine Most of the people who like Adventure Time probably like Steven Universe.

580
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,810
Speaker 1: How many people are there that are like Adventure Time only or Steven Universe only actually?

581
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:06,070
Speaker 0: What's weird is a lot of people who are deep into Adventure Time that I see and even some people we know Once they saw Steven Universe.

582
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:12,013
Speaker 0: It's like they forgot what Adventure Time was and decided Steven Universe is great and Adventure Time sucks Because it vented.

583
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:18,850
Speaker 0: I'm suck there because Steven Universe has a straight forward direct narrative and Adventure Time is cool and experimental.

584
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,010
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but I've had some arguments.

585
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:26,103
Speaker 1: You liked it for all those years and now suddenly you just change your mind.

586
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've had some arguments.

587
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:32,950
Speaker 1: That's like the people who are like can we be up was good until it got popular.

588
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,054
Speaker 1: It's like that guy.

589
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:35,701
Speaker 1: the show is the same show.

590
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,705
Speaker 1: It doesn't change.

591
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:38,070
Speaker 1: It's the same animation.

592
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,144
Speaker 1: It can't change quality doesn't change over time.

593
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:41,090
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway.

594
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,658
Speaker 0: So here's here's what I'm getting at.

595
00:36:44,678 --> 00:37:06,870
Speaker 0: the only distinction between Anime anime at an anime con and Steven Universe and anime con is that the people and studio that made that anime were owned by a Japanese interest in Japan and I had to be kind of circumspect there because a lot of animation gets outsourced to Korea.

596
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,716
Speaker 1: Is that anime now or other places?

597
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:12,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if the only distinction is this specific?

598
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:24,824
Speaker 0: View of made by Japanese people in Japan Which is being blurred by the fact that the world is modern and global Then the only reason to have an anime con that exactly

599
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:30,270
Speaker 1: you have to admit that what you know It's not necessarily the fact that it was made in Japan in Japan by Japanese people.

600
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:40,770
Speaker 1: It's that the kind of an animation that is made By, you know for a Japanese audience not even necessarily by Japanese people or by Japanese studio, right?

601
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:57,350
Speaker 1: That is you know called anime Duh has certain genres tropes styles, even though I know that there's no uniform anime style true But I but there are certain tropes and certain characteristics of those animations versus other animations.

602
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:02,610
Speaker 1: Not that other animations of other countries don't you know completely exclude those tropes.

603
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:05,450
Speaker 0: But so what about shows like walk through?

604
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:15,682
Speaker 0: From France that have all those tropes and might as well be an anime except they're not made in Japan Like they're in that same, you know quote-unquote bad show.

605
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:16,224
Speaker 1: I don't like it.

606
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:17,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying it has all those tropes.

607
00:38:18,291 --> 00:38:20,100
Speaker 0: Why is that not welcome that an anime con?

608
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,125
Speaker 0: because again you're getting back to this.

609
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,230
Speaker 1: Why would you not welcome it?

610
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:22,835
Speaker 0: It's not.

611
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:26,779
Speaker 0: it's not anime The people who want to make the definition.

612
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:33,089
Speaker 0: I feel like there's no purpose for anime cons being restricted based on Japan.

613
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,875
Speaker 1: Hmm it's a conventions.

614
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:39,327
Speaker 1: people are getting together to have a good time and enjoy the culture that they share.

615
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:43,230
Speaker 1: if this culture that They share they will enjoy it in that space that they come together.

616
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:44,414
Speaker 1: It's not about.

617
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:47,904
Speaker 1: but you know, it's not the culture that part doesn't come first.

618
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,730
Speaker 1: It's the people come first, right?

619
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,161
Speaker 1: It's you get the like-minded people whatever they have.

620
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:54,029
Speaker 1: like-minded is what they're gonna do.

621
00:38:54,411 --> 00:39:00,050
Speaker 1: Right if you went to a sci-fi con a while a long time ago It would have been like mostly Star Trek shit and Ray Bradbury shit.

622
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,745
Speaker 1: And if you go to one now, it's probably gonna be like the exact same people and nothing's changed.

623
00:39:05,347 --> 00:39:05,668
Speaker 0: maybe.

624
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:07,348
Speaker 0: but yeah I've been to sci-fi cons.

625
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:11,473
Speaker 1: It's like, you know this newer like if you go to fantasy con It's like they're.

626
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:16,829
Speaker 1: you know, maybe before they were all Lord of the Rings and now they're all Game of Thrones And it's just you know, the things change.

627
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:22,850
Speaker 1: But it's those people whatever the people that are coming to the convention that community whatever that community that's getting together enjoys.

628
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:32,204
Speaker 1: That's what they're gonna celebrate while they're there Even if even if you kept it to just anime it used to be for my Locomist and then it was Naruto and now it's something else.

629
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:42,150
Speaker 0: It's like okay last night Emily and I were watching a whole bunch of AMVs and It that was interesting because at this point I feel like people still call and like they say AMV.

630
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:51,808
Speaker 0: But most of the new things like that they're being made are all to like Steven Universe and Adventure Time and Bojack and stuff Like that, okay, and but I found remember that older right now one.

631
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:56,290
Speaker 0: Yeah That was like the biggest deal AMV back in the day because none of the shows in that anyone.

632
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:02,421
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we were watching it and Emily and I were like, wow Literally no one in anime con would know who the fuck Ryoga is like.

633
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:06,987
Speaker 0: this doesn't make any sense to anyone in the modern era except us old people.

634
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,618
Speaker 0: So it's I guess you're.

635
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:13,717
Speaker 0: it's hard to stop saying anime Because it's so widely used.

636
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:16,830
Speaker 0: but I'm no longer gonna call manga mock comics or comics.

637
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:26,710
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna call any sort of like sequential art like that a comic not gonna try to make a distinction For manga just because it was made on the eye in the islands of Japan.

638
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,761
Speaker 1: I don't just think it because it's made in Japan.

639
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:36,189
Speaker 1: I just think manga because When manga is produced in a different way, right then paying people even less.

640
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,992
Speaker 1: Well, yes paying people even less.

641
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:50,698
Speaker 1: but the fact that it's weekly and in black and white and produced rapidly right results in You know a different, you know There are certain qualities that you will get in that kind of production that you do not get in.

642
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:54,640
Speaker 1: You know a comic made in the US and Marvel where it's a monthly pamphlet.

643
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:03,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a different result doing things that way and therefore even though it's still sequential art That makes it a different genre.

644
00:41:04,353 --> 00:41:10,836
Speaker 1: not the fact that it's from Japan But the fact the way it's produced was you know causes certain characteristics that make it a different genre.

645
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:15,900
Speaker 1: or at least, you know Section even if you like I both have superheroes like a superhero is a genre.

646
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:26,260
Speaker 1: you could have a superhero manga and an American superhero comic, but the superhero manga will be Significantly different but you could say the same the American version because of that distinction.

647
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,248
Speaker 0: Like there are words to talk about French comics.

648
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,658
Speaker 0: French comics have the same thing like on day dizzy name.

649
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:35,120
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, that's why they call them bond a dizzy name because I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

650
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:35,858
Speaker 0: That's close enough.

651
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,111
Speaker 1: But here's a big fancy ass book and it's like.

652
00:41:39,191 --> 00:41:40,696
Speaker 1: the way they produce it is so different.

653
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:42,444
Speaker 1: you get a different result that you would never see.

654
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:49,160
Speaker 1: but someone making a comic in the US although people in America I mean in the US could make an album just like the way the French do they just don't.

655
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,949
Speaker 0: But most people in America even comics fans even people who know a lot about it.

656
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,900
Speaker 0: Don't call them bond as they call them comics.

657
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,405
Speaker 1: Calm bond, isn't it?

658
00:41:58,485 --> 00:41:59,229
Speaker 0: You do you're weird.

659
00:41:59,550 --> 00:41:59,912
Speaker 1: That's all.

660
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:03,476
Speaker 1: but the thing is when I get a French comic It's not in that format anymore.

661
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:03,778
Speaker 1: Is it?

662
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,880
Speaker 1: It's in like a trade paperback if it was still in that big-ass book.

663
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:10,218
Speaker 1: I thought use that word to refer to those big-ass books.

664
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:14,280
Speaker 0: Yeah I've seen a lot of those that are.

665
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:27,214
Speaker 0: When I was in high school taking French class there was a kid name was Sean and We had to pick French names for the class, you know, like language classes name from us.

666
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:38,815
Speaker 0: So he was like croissant and the teachers like you can't call yourself croissant and he Made a big fucking deal about that and eventually like the school said alright fine.

667
00:42:39,196 --> 00:42:40,660
Speaker 0: He can call himself croissant.

668
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,153
Speaker 0: you can't stop it croissant.

669
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:48,896
Speaker 0: and That like I. just I called that guy croissant for like four years even outside class.

670
00:42:49,077 --> 00:42:52,759
Speaker 0: Yeah a-plus My hero it became his name.

671
00:42:53,846 --> 00:42:54,578
Speaker 1: What's up croissant?

672
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,704
Speaker 0: And on that note we killed enough time with the topic of little piston people off and will have Consumed.

673
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:02,952
Speaker 1: him seems to care a lot about this.

674
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:05,524
Speaker 1: I don't give a shit Wilkins Wilkins I just it's.

675
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:10,380
Speaker 0: I feel like anime cons that try to focus on just Japan in the u.s.

676
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,423
Speaker 0: In the modern era.

677
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:15,714
Speaker 0: edge into this like fetishizing Japan area.

678
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:18,200
Speaker 1: people have been fetishizing Japan for a long ass time.

679
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:29,656
Speaker 0: Yeah Since I discovered that it existed and I feel like there's almost zero value to conventions around that in the modern Era, I mean Yeah, yeah.

680
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:37,820
Speaker 0: But now we'll have consumed some shared media and we'll have a topic of a review of some kind on the next Wednesday.
