1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,377
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday May 30th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:18,075
Speaker 0: tonight We have the first tiny bit of an amazement coverage and Scott talks about how much he hates planet side.

3
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:19,540
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:22,371
Speaker 0: So we've always known about Google Calendar.

5
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:23,636
Speaker 0: I mean we knew it was there.

6
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:24,319
Speaker 0: We had it.

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,804
Speaker 0: We just didn't really.

8
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:31,140
Speaker 1: actually it's relatively new and I remember the day it came out because everyone was like oh my god.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,106
Speaker 1: Google Calendar and I was like Whatever.

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,020
Speaker 1: I don't use any calendar software every calendar software ever.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,241
Speaker 1: I've.

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:46,820
Speaker 1: just whenever I have a paper calendar or a digital calendar or anything like that I start to use it for two seconds or so and then I stopped using it and I never look at it again.

13
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:53,206
Speaker 0: Yep I've only ever used them at work where I had to schedule appointments and I don't remember Appointments because I don't really care about them.

14
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:54,551
Speaker 0: I care about conventions.

15
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,960
Speaker 0: So I never need to remind myself when I'm going somewhere.

16
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:59,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's I don't forget where I have to be ever.

17
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:05,254
Speaker 0: but Well, the problem is we tend to forget if I already have something scheduled.

18
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:20,960
Speaker 0: when I'm trying to figure out if I can go to another thing Like someone says hey you want to go to something something on something something and I'm like, ah, maybe Anyway, so today I finally decided to click because we have the Google Gmail for domains thing.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,766
Speaker 1: So I went in.

20
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:24,693
Speaker 1: there's a little calendar link in the top left.

21
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:29,240
Speaker 1: So I decided alright, I'll click on it and look see Apparently it's actually really good.

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,870
Speaker 1: It's probably the best calendar ever used and I added all the.

23
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:42,400
Speaker 1: I created one calendar for me and a calendar for the front row Crew and I added all sorts of front row crew events to it and it's all public and sharing and all that good stuff.

24
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:43,724
Speaker 0: Yep, someday.

25
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:47,595
Speaker 0: We'll probably expand it and offer email addresses to I don't know cool listeners.

26
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,260
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll give them away as we don't have that many.

27
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,485
Speaker 0: Well, we'll get more someday.

28
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:57,519
Speaker 0: I imagine I was just paying for the full-on one maybe but for now No only the elitist of the elite get them meaning the people who already know us.

29
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:01,460
Speaker 1: But I think anyone in the world I can make it so anyone in the world can see the calendars.

30
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:08,901
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I'll set that up soon and you'll be able to see the front row crew schedule, which is So far her.

31
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:13,334
Speaker 1: in June there are two conventions a board game meeting and a concert.

32
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,500
Speaker 1: great and I'm going to a baseball game.

33
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:16,865
Speaker 0: You know what?

34
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,660
Speaker 0: We should probably set one up for that Moz group, too.

35
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:24,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I could set up a separate Moz calendar because right now I'm just using the.

36
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:27,700
Speaker 1: I just put Moz event in our calendar.

37
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, I should probably make a Moz calendar or whatever.

38
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's all I mean.

39
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,100
Speaker 0: no one listening cares about that.

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,545
Speaker 0: The most people don't listen to our show.

41
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:37,214
Speaker 0: No, no, even though we run all of their IT.

42
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:37,735
Speaker 1: Yep.

43
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:38,418
Speaker 1: Yep.

44
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:42,290
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, but we like Google Calendar now and we're playing with it.

45
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:42,912
Speaker 1: Yep.

46
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:51,320
Speaker 1: So it's if you have a Google Calendar Maybe we'll start a Google Calendar thread in the forums and share everyone's Google calendars with each other or something like that.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd say tell your funny calendar stories, but there aren't any funny.

48
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:02,700
Speaker 1: If you have a funny counter story hot name, yeah, so one day this calendar and your mom.

49
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,418
Speaker 1: What about your mom?

50
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:10,720
Speaker 0: What were you doing with your mom in the back seat rolling around?

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,814
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I've got it scheduled for next week on my calendar.

52
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:18,439
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so video game day in the news.

53
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:22,675
Speaker 0: I'm sure you all have heard this but we were remember we're not the news.

54
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,220
Speaker 0: we talk about the news.

55
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,299
Speaker 0: So if we give the news and you've already heard it, that's the point.

56
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:30,008
Speaker 1: The we haven't already heard it.

57
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,639
Speaker 1: You're detached from society and you're not a good geek.

58
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:34,600
Speaker 1: Go read some websites.

59
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,300
Speaker 0: The Wii is going to be two hundred and fifty dollars.

60
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:44,900
Speaker 1: This isn't really news because I guess the story before was the Wii will not be more than two hundred fifty dollars.

61
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:46,246
Speaker 1: They guaranteed us.

62
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:48,173
Speaker 1: It would be 250 or less now.

63
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:48,977
Speaker 1: It's 250 for sure.

64
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:55,720
Speaker 0: Well, I remember that the Super Nintendo was two hundred and fifty dollars when it came out And it shortly dropped to two hundred.

65
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,403
Speaker 0: The NES.

66
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:00,373
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly how much it started as but we have two hundred bucks.

67
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:01,015
Speaker 0: I think so.

68
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:02,500
Speaker 0: I notice a pattern.

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, now this is going to destroy the PlayStation 3.

70
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently before e3 they asked the Japanese gamers.

71
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:17,154
Speaker 1: Hey, what do you want?

72
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:17,875
Speaker 1: And yeah ps3s RPGs.

73
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,521
Speaker 0: I mean, we're talking like Famitsu readers like the hardest of car like Japan We are.

74
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,906
Speaker 1: the thing is to us.

75
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,996
Speaker 1: Famitsu is the elite gaming magazine in Japan.

76
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:30,080
Speaker 1: Famitsu is game pro.

77
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's Japanese.

78
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:33,159
Speaker 1: It's elite by default.

79
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:39,790
Speaker 1: But You know, it's like we think shonen jump Japan is so awesome to them.

80
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,214
Speaker 1: It's just shonen jump.

81
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:43,300
Speaker 1: He might as well be spider-man, you know.

82
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:47,137
Speaker 1: They look at shonen jump the way we look at spider-man.

83
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:51,987
Speaker 1: So The Yeah, they're well.

84
00:04:52,027 --> 00:05:01,120
Speaker 1: after e3 all the Japanese gamers are like And like 83% of them said the ps3 was too expensive.

85
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:10,549
Speaker 0: and of course once again for the price of a ps3 you can buy a fully loaded Xbox 360 and a Wii and Still have money left over in a somewhat legitimate poll.

86
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:11,792
Speaker 1: I think I said this yesterday.

87
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:14,199
Speaker 1: They asked people what system are you gonna buy?

88
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:17,889
Speaker 1: and half of People said a 360 and a Wii.

89
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:22,675
Speaker 1: 25% of people said we only.

90
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:31,607
Speaker 1: that means 75% penetration on the Wii Plan.

91
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:37,759
Speaker 1: that yeah, I'm sure you didn't Just had to work harder to get a hundred percent penetrate.

92
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:44,958
Speaker 0: Well, I gotta buy my own controller so we'll have some double penetrate All right.

93
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's what I want to know.

94
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,353
Speaker 1: how much is the controller gonna cost?

95
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:53,287
Speaker 1: because if it's 50 bucks for one of those Fancy doodad things.

96
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:54,552
Speaker 1: There's no way in hell.

97
00:05:54,592 --> 00:06:04,367
Speaker 0: I'm buying three extra ones When I get the system, well, I'll point out that the tradition in our household is that Scott buys a GameCube I buy a controller for me.

98
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:05,972
Speaker 0: Scott buys a revolution.

99
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:07,960
Speaker 0: I'm going to buy a controller for me.

100
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,208

Speaker 1: touch on the.

113
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:46,614
Speaker 0: we Are being silly today.

114
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:53,632
Speaker 0: This is just like a way started with an accidental non intentional.

115
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,000
Speaker 0: we joke, you see what kind of people we are.

116

122
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,480
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go very broadly and then we'll go into what happened.

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:41,400
Speaker 0: I just want to say that a lot of times we'll see a product and we'll know Exactly where the buzz about this product came from and it's usually obvious to us if or if not Something is legitimately popular or if it is popular due to some sort of shilling.

124
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:43,464
Speaker 1: Shilling not Curt.

125
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:47,640
Speaker 1: shilling the major league baseball pitcher slash EverQuest player?

126
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,383
Speaker 1: No, not him.

127
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:51,274
Speaker 0: and not shilling as in the British currency.

128
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:52,579
Speaker 1: Nope, not those either.

129
00:07:53,305 --> 00:08:02,020
Speaker 0: shilling as in Hocking words as in the people who keeps trying to get us to talk about their stupid books on geek nights.

130
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,186
Speaker 0: Yes Which we're not going to do.

131
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:06,636
Speaker 1: not going to interview about your book that we've never read.

132
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:07,540
Speaker 1: that no one cares about.

133
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,735
Speaker 0: If we did, we'd probably pan it just because you showed.

134
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:11,338
Speaker 1: Yes.

135
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:11,840
Speaker 1: All right.

136
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,963
Speaker 1: So there was an.

137
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,868
Speaker 1: here's the story of what happened today.

138
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:20,904
Speaker 1: There was an article on the ABC News website about this Miracle chemical.

139
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:39,628
Speaker 1: on they didn't think they said the word miracle, but it's a chemical called I can't in Mexico something It doesn't matter what the name of the chemicals, okay, Mexico real m e X o r y l. Anyway, the story behind Mexico and this is all true.

140
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:40,309
Speaker 1: I checked out.

141
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,197
Speaker 0: science wise is that what in your lab?

142
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah I was wearing a lab coat at the time At that stolen from Lewis black.

143
00:08:53,224 --> 00:09:07,980
Speaker 1: Okay, so The story behind this chemical is this the sunscreen that we buy in America has the SPF's and the SPF's Depending on the number block UVB rays.

144
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:14,130
Speaker 1: UVB rays cause Cancer and tanning and sunburn and tanning.

145
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,117
Speaker 0: so they're good and bad and you need some but not too many.

146
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,983
Speaker 0: if you have darker skin You need you.

147
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:21,153
Speaker 0: more is good and it can't hurt you as much.

148
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:22,620
Speaker 0: you have lighter skin more hurts you more.

149
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,358
Speaker 0: You know that it's all commonly known.

150
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:32,520
Speaker 1: SPF's that we get in our current Sunscreen do not protect against UVA rays, but that's okay.

151
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:36,719
Speaker 1: UVA rays don't cause cancer and sunburn, but they do cause wrinkles.

152
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:44,756
Speaker 1: So if you were able to block the UVA rays You would not be as wrinkly when you're an old fogey if you hang out on the beach all the time.

153
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

154
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:50,416
Speaker 1: So I guess if you really, you know care about vanity and whatnot, that's a good thing.

155
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:56,277
Speaker 1: but This chemical Mexeril, I guess if that I pronounce it right who cares.

156
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:57,544
Speaker 0: I don't know Okay.

157
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,639
Speaker 1: Anyway, who cares of the name of the chemical?

158
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:16,469
Speaker 1: is it can block all UVA rays and some UVB rays and they've been using it in sunscreen in Europe and Canada and other places since 1993 and Most scientific studies say it's it's just fine.

159
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:17,031
Speaker 1: It's safe.

160
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:17,793
Speaker 1: It won't kill you.

161
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,575
Speaker 1: It doesn't hurt you.

162
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:19,498
Speaker 1: It's great.

163
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:20,320
Speaker 1: It's fantastic.

164
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:21,124
Speaker 1: Everyone should use it.

165
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:27,080
Speaker 0: There's no reason to not just put it in all the sunscreen and help people out and The FDA hasn't approved it yet.

166
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,659
Speaker 1: So it's not in sunscreen.

167
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:36,140
Speaker 1: But apparently some pharmacists are selling it under the counter for big monies and you could buy it online for big monies.

168
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:41,359
Speaker 1: And yeah now yeah, I saw right through this.

169
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:46,940
Speaker 1: You see most people on the internet read this article and they take it at face value.

170
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:53,683
Speaker 1: You know, it was on dig and it was on some other websites and everyone's like, oh my god The government is.

171
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,348
Speaker 1: you know, the FDA sucks.

172
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:58,436
Speaker 1: They're preventing us from using this amazing chemical bureaucracy.

173
00:10:58,476 --> 00:10:59,700
Speaker 1: blah, you know.

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,483
Speaker 1: And yeah, okay.

175
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:01,326
Speaker 1: Those things are true.

176
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:09,379
Speaker 1: The government's pretty incompetent and stupid and the FDA isn't perfect and they prevent us from getting things we should have.

177
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:15,720
Speaker 1: and You know, there are things we shouldn't have that they let us have because companies bribe the FDA and all this business.

178
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, homeopathy shouldn't be around.

179
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:23,754
Speaker 1: All that stuff is true, but that's not what's really going on here.

180
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:30,963
Speaker 1: What's really going on here is look You're looking at an article on ABC News.

181
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:41,396
Speaker 0: now know how it suddenly appeared on a major news as opposed to appearing slowly on many sites or and some Blog or on multiple news sites simultaneously.

182
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:46,465
Speaker 1: Yep which means Some PR guy.

183
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:47,568
Speaker 1: this is what happened.

184
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:57,639
Speaker 1: for anyone who doesn't see the obvious some public relations guy went to ABC News and said Hey, you know, there's this miracle chemical that blocks UVA rays called mexor ill.

185
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,525
Speaker 1: How come no one uses it?

186
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:00,669
Speaker 1: and the guy went huh?

187
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,094
Speaker 1: How come no one uses it?

188
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,779
Speaker 1: and he wrote an article about it.

189
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,209
Speaker 1: You know who they were.

190
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:12,979
Speaker 1: that PR guy was from L'Oreal the company which owns the patent on mexor ill, huh?

191
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,805
Speaker 1: Now we don't have any.

192
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,789
Speaker 1: you know, if you're looking for evidence that this like who was the PR guy When did he make you?

193
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,539
Speaker 1: we don't have that?

194
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:35,580
Speaker 1: It's just so blatantly obvious that the company that produces and wants to sell mexor ill in the United States is Going to round two newspapers telling them to write articles about mexor ill to get the American public all enraged about it.

195
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:38,838
Speaker 1: So the FDA will approve it and they'll be able to make a shit ton of money.

196
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:40,546
Speaker 0: How do I do that?

197
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,700
Speaker 1: It's so obvious that you know.

198
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,979
Speaker 1: But it it's the things like this that people don't see when you're not trained to look for them.

199
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:51,100
Speaker 1: So I'm not telling you not to buy mexor ill.

200
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,395
Speaker 1: In fact, you should buy some mexor ill if you can because it's awesome.

201
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:55,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really does work.

202
00:12:55,701 --> 00:13:00,359
Speaker 1: yeah, but don't buy it overpriced under the counter from the pharmacist or anything like that.

203
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:10,279
Speaker 1: and If it comes on the market in the US as a result of all this PR Pushing by these companies that produce it so be it.

204
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:17,227
Speaker 1: But when it comes out buy it from you know, the no-name brand That way.

205
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:18,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's awesome.

206
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,743
Speaker 0: I mean just in general.

207
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:28,132
Speaker 0: remember that whenever you see a news article like that look for the warning signs of hey This is a shell because it often is he this doesn't.

208
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:29,739
Speaker 1: even this article is not.

209
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,335
Speaker 1: you know You have to be trained to see this kind of thing because it doesn't mention any companies.

210
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:34,580
Speaker 1: It doesn't mention anything.

211
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,426
Speaker 1: It says there is this great chemical.

212
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:37,931
Speaker 1: It does these great things.

213
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:40,860
Speaker 1: The FDA has blocked it all its try.

214
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:42,255
Speaker 1: But you know, you're like, huh?

215
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,612
Speaker 1: Alright, that seems like a legitimate news story.

216
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:50,933
Speaker 0: now warning sign number one The chemicals been around for a long time and this suddenly makes the news.

217
00:13:51,294 --> 00:13:55,770
Speaker 0: Yep warning sign number two It appeared on one news site.

218
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:58,580
Speaker 0: that news site was not the AP wire or Reuters.

219
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:03,333
Speaker 0: Nope Because these people generally won't pay every news site.

220
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,539
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it looks obvious Mm-hmm.

221
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,920
Speaker 0: Of course It looks more obvious when they only pay one because how come no one else is running this story?

222
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,837
Speaker 0: Very few journalists actually do their own investigative journalism.

223
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:23,587
Speaker 0: these days almost any story you see on the news is either paid for by a company paid for by a third party for some other reason or taken from the AP wire or Reuters

224
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:31,179
Speaker 1: or someone or some third party made the story and The company the news you're watching just bought that story and played it

225
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,411
Speaker 0: Yep, or a lot of companies just make news stories and give away for free.

226
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,739
Speaker 0: Yep, because they're actually shells.

227
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:48,493
Speaker 0: Or, you know President Bush makes news stories and gives them away for free and Fox News plays all of them or President Bush hires A gay porn actor to pretend to be a reporter and hang out in the White House asking softball questions.

228
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:55,053
Speaker 0: I Wish that story would get more press too bad.

229
00:14:55,655 --> 00:15:02,994
Speaker 0: All those stories are true All right, so back to video game news because it's video game day.

230
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:07,229
Speaker 1: well, it's it's total game day But yeah, it's really only video games today.

231
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:09,757
Speaker 0: It's video games because we're not really gonna talk about non video games.

232
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:32,720
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, so some guys were testing out the Vista beta 2. now in the history of Windows Beta 2 has always been sort of important because It's the first version that you can actually use all the time, you know, the beta ones and the pre betas Were always too unstable and they would crash whenever you tried to use them for too long.

233
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,689
Speaker 1: But beta 2 has always been the first version.

234
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:42,960
Speaker 1: where it was good enough to use as your operating system You'd have to deal with problems, but it wouldn't crash and be useless.

235
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:48,979
Speaker 1: So they tried to play some games on beta 2 and they took some benchmarks and all that.

236
00:15:49,702 --> 00:16:00,960
Speaker 1: Now the story here is that any game with the evil Star Force DRM didn't work Because Vista doesn't allow the installing of unsigned drivers, which we mentioned quite a while ago on geek nights.

237
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,480
Speaker 0: So one evil turn has prevented another evil turn.

238
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:10,454
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how this is gonna play out hilarity for geeks like us.

239
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:18,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, either games won't work Star Force will have to change its ways or Microsoft will take a lot of money out of Star Force.

240
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 0: cuz Microsoft doesn't care.

241
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,748
Speaker 0: Microsoft doesn't use Star Force in their games.

242
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,735
Speaker 0: No, they don't care if this company survives.

243
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,920
Speaker 0: They're not gonna go easy on them.

244
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,320
Speaker 1: They're not gonna make a bad care about some Russian evil DRM spyware bad driver guys.

245
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:40,019
Speaker 0: If anything I would guess that Microsoft at least the people from the gaming side of Microsoft or even the operating system Don't like Star Force because it gives PC gaming a bad name.

246
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:53,870
Speaker 1: They want PC gaming to be strong and on Vista and even so if If Star Force wants their driver Which isn't really a driver to be signed by Microsoft Mary let's not go to approve it.

247
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,525
Speaker 1: if it makes people's computers crash like it currently does So they're gonna.

248
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:02,140
Speaker 1: Star Force might have to fix it or Star Force might have to die.

249
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Microsoft may be evil But they would.

250
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:08,896
Speaker 0: they would never let some let something make their operating system worse.

251
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:16,154
Speaker 1: if they can prevent it Especially when it's someone else They don't mind if they fuck it up because they can cover it up.

252
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:29,740
Speaker 1: if someone else fucks it up You know at least and they don't not gonna attach their name to someone else fucking it up Yeah Which me you know and signing the driver and allowing it to install and Vista would be putting their name on something shitty.

253
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:33,314
Speaker 1: If someone else wants to fuck up Windows Microsoft, let's.

254
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:34,178
Speaker 1: it's all you.

255
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:35,945
Speaker 1: It's nothing to do with us.

256
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:37,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get me party software novel.

257
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:42,423
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

258
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:43,124
Speaker 1: I just thought it's funny.

259
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:51,239
Speaker 1: It's a thing of the day.

260
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:51,579
Speaker 1: rewind.

261
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:54,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're talking retro.

262
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,700
Speaker 1: We're talking before geek nights existed.

263
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:06,850
Speaker 1: We're gonna go with I guess things of the day from years and years ago because guess what there really wasn't anything on the internet today Not a humorous anyway, except for that monkey.

264
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:08,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll do the monkey tomorrow.

265
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:09,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, we will.

266
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,274
Speaker 0: So anyone who's listening now if you look in rims delicious, you will see a link to tomorrow's thing of the day At least rims thing.

267
00:18:15,457 --> 00:18:17,725
Speaker 1: No Anyway rim being me.

268
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:21,296
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna rewind it to one of my old favorite thing old.

269
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:25,279
Speaker 1: Oh incredibly old school thing of the day.

270
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,772
Speaker 1: Okay Lobster magnet.

271
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:37,516
Speaker 0: now This is probably the exact opposite of my thing of the day, which is from the same era.

272
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:41,039
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's one of the original memes.

273
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,087
Speaker 1: Basically, how did I find this?

274
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,376
Speaker 1: I think 8-bit theater has had a link.

275
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:48,224
Speaker 0: Yes it was 8-bit theater.

276
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:59,060
Speaker 1: a bit theater had a page of funny links and one of the funny links was Lobster magnet and it's this guy singing a pretty bad but amusing metal song.

277
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,295
Speaker 1: I guess if you want to call it that so you've got a lobster and you've got a magnet.

278
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:04,500
Speaker 1: take a ticket ticket ticket.

279
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,938
Speaker 0: Lobster has antenna, but don't you grab it?

280
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,609
Speaker 0: And We're not doing all.

281
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,820
Speaker 1: magnet made of iron.

282
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,504
Speaker 0: Lobster has a B.

283
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:18,439
Speaker 1: Oh, it's made of meat meat meat of meat and then later it's like rabbit made of steel.

284
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:24,934
Speaker 1: Lobster has a beak Dan in an in an in an in a. Lobster sticks to Meg.

285
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:25,660
Speaker 1: You can just.

286
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,707
Speaker 1: You can just watch the flash.

287
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:33,322
Speaker 0: Yes, this is old and I don't know why we found it So hilarious.

288
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:36,073
Speaker 0: maybe mostly because these sort of things were new back then.

289
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,720
Speaker 1: It's still good today.

290
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,565
Speaker 0: It's better than a lot of things.

291
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,414
Speaker 1: I've seen recently it is it's humorous.

292
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,260
Speaker 1: It's kind of wacky.

293
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,398
Speaker 1: It sounds cool.

294
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,507
Speaker 0: We used to sing upstairs funny-looking.

295
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:53,277
Speaker 0: We used to sing it somewhat incessantly much to the annoyance of the front row crew.

296
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:54,220
Speaker 1: That's fine.

297
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:58,995
Speaker 1: You better watch out if you know the antennas and the magnets.

298
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:09,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the claws Bite your claw your eye Claw your ear and then it'll bite your eye All right, and then it'll sink your cruise ship.

299
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:13,612
Speaker 0: Now that is an example of one of the good memes back then.

300
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,097
Speaker 0: that was it spread far and wide.

301
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:15,859
Speaker 0: It was very popular.

302
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,420
Speaker 0: Mine is an example of perhaps the first dark age of memes.

303
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:25,196
Speaker 0: We are currently entering the second dark age of memes and I'll explain that in a minute.

304
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:27,853
Speaker 1: So this So wait, so there were.

305
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:34,568
Speaker 1: there were Crusades And Bad memes arose that were long forgotten.

306
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:38,640
Speaker 0: so I built a fourth me that one burnt down fell over then sank into the style project.

307
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,784
Speaker 0: So not too long after Lobster magnet came out.

308
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:50,016
Speaker 0: There was a news story about a bird a coin bird.

309
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:56,547
Speaker 0: a guy had I believe it was a car wash and Someone kept stealing quarters from his change machine.

310
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:03,526
Speaker 0: So one day one day he sets up a camera to catch the punk kids and Sure enough.

311
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:11,959
Speaker 0: He sees this bird Fly up to it fly in just wiggle its way into the machine come out a minute later with one quarter and fly away.

312
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:13,908
Speaker 0: Then about ten minutes later.

313
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:16,480
Speaker 0: It comes back and steals another quarter and does this constantly.

314
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:18,325
Speaker 0: He why he goes out.

315
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,210
Speaker 0: He waits for the bird.

316
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:19,732
Speaker 0: He watches it.

317
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,440
Speaker 0: It goes up onto the roof of his place.

318
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,079
Speaker 0: He goes up there and there are thousands of dollars worth of quarters all over the roof.

319
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,379
Speaker 0: The bird was just stealing the quarters and putting them on the roof.

320
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,607
Speaker 1: Was he making a coin nest?

321
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,533
Speaker 0: I don't know coin nesting.

322
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:36,400
Speaker 0: I don't even remember the story to nest.

323
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:44,596
Speaker 0: That is my recollection of the story that I read, you know I'll try to find the original story and if I can find it in with no effort will link to it.

324
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:49,239
Speaker 0: All right Now someone made a flash video about the coin bird.

325
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:53,499
Speaker 1: Well, some kid drew him MS paint comic, oh, yeah, you want the whole story.

326
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:55,326
Speaker 0: MS paint comics.

327
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:56,471
Speaker 0: MS paint comics.

328
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:57,956
Speaker 0: Let's make a flash.

329
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:58,920
Speaker 0: flash was made.

330
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,205
Speaker 0: Someone made a song for it.

331
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:00,968
Speaker 0: Now.

332
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:10,399
Speaker 0: This was an example of a me angry for Someone summoned the coin bird Coiny.

333
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:15,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I promise to help children and help coins.

334
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:17,956
Speaker 1: I like children.

335
00:22:18,118 --> 00:22:26,740
Speaker 0: and Now this was very obviously an attempt by the people who made it to be the next thing.

336
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,288
Speaker 0: Like they saw lobster magnet was popular.

337
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:31,094
Speaker 0: They saw all your base was popular.

338
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:32,720
Speaker 0: They wanted to be popular.

339
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,154
Speaker 0: So they made this specifically in hopes that would be picked up by the internet and become popular.

340
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:44,476
Speaker 1: They tried to make a meme on Purpose instead of just trying to make something funny for the sake of being funny.

341
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:45,640
Speaker 1: They tried to make something.

342
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,132
Speaker 1: You know, they didn't try to make it funny.

343
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:49,300
Speaker 1: They tried to make it popular.

344
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:51,651
Speaker 0: I believe we have to come back with the Rama Sharma.

345
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:53,419
Speaker 0: You tried to do too much with it.

346
00:22:58,161 --> 00:23:02,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, now it did not spread far and wide and it is not that funny.

347
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:03,998
Speaker 1: no, it's really not funny.

348
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:08,520
Speaker 0: now I say the first Dark Age because we are currently entering the second Dark Age.

349
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:12,032
Speaker 0: I mean there was Numa Numa and Numa Numa is awesome.

350
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,340
Speaker 0: Like Numa Numa is one of my favorite things on the internet.

351
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:15,145
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good one.

352
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:16,837
Speaker 0: Yeah, it makes me very happy to watch it.

353
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:20,069
Speaker 0: It's a very Maya.

354
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:26,429
Speaker 0: ha Yep now look around YouTube or Google video.

355
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,602
Speaker 0: there are thousands of fat kids lip-syncing to something Mm-hmm.

356
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:34,220
Speaker 0: They're all trying to be the next Numa Numa or the next Star Wars kid.

357
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,797
Speaker 1: But yeah, apparently those like two Chinese kids doing the Backstreet Boys were real popular.

358
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:41,221
Speaker 1: They're still real popular I don't.

359
00:23:41,422 --> 00:23:46,360
Speaker 1: what makes them any better than the thousands of other high school punk kids doing some other song?

360
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:48,597
Speaker 0: Yep, they're coin bird as far as I'm concerned.

361
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,659
Speaker 0: Yep Now I'll warn you lobster magnet is funny.

362
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:55,773
Speaker 0: Be prepared to not be amazed by coin bird.

363
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,759
Speaker 0: In fact prepared to be underwhelmed.

364
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much it's all MS paint.

365
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:03,793
Speaker 1: so what do you want?

366
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:04,937
Speaker 0: it's real bad.

367
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:05,740
Speaker 1: it's real bad.

368
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:09,493
Speaker 1: Wow, if it's bad, should it really be a thing of the day?

369
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it teaches a valuable lesson.

370
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,366
Speaker 0: Don't Underwhelming this.

371
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:21,680
Speaker 0: it is underwhelming.

372
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:23,885
Speaker 1: No, you know, you see what it is.

373
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:24,950
Speaker 1: We prime them.

374
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:29,300
Speaker 1: See if you would have said lobster magnet was terrible They would have watched it and said yeah, that was terrible.

375
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,570
Speaker 1: Just like you said if you would have said coin bird was awesome They would have watched it and said it was awesome.

376
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,200
Speaker 1: Just like we said, you know what we could have done.

377
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:41,935
Speaker 0: I mean, we could have set up two identical episodes of geek nights Except we say the opposite thing for the things of the day.

378
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:42,578
Speaker 0: I could have done that.

379
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:52,756
Speaker 0: Then if we ran the DNS server instead of contracting it out We could have set up a round-robin thing where every other person who downloaded the show got a different one and then we could see What the effects were?

380
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:57,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's too late to do that But how do we know which people watch which episode?

381
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:00,075
Speaker 0: because then we say hey guess what we did.

382
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:05,268
Speaker 0: now the after everyone gives their opinions And then we ask people to self-identify.

383
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,139
Speaker 0: very not scientific, but I trust our listeners.

384
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:13,872
Speaker 1: See we do control the DNS server to do a round-robin.

385
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,040
Speaker 1: Do you just type something in the DNS record?

386
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,684
Speaker 0: Sort of there you can.

387
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:22,594
Speaker 0: there are softwares you can use to make like specifically round-robin.

388
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:28,109
Speaker 1: like every x1s go to y But you can freely modify the DNS record.

389
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could do a basic round-robin.

390
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:35,431
Speaker 0: It's not very predictable or Well, it's not very predictable, but it works pretty well.

391
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:36,535
Speaker 0: The problem is we don't really need it.

392
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:37,700
Speaker 0: All it does is load balance.

393
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,248
Speaker 0: Yep, I would want to do a strict 50/50 or something with this.

394
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:49,840
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm In the spirit of slacking off all week, we don't have a particular main topic.

395
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:55,120
Speaker 1: Well, we could talk about new Mario Brothers, but I just unlocked level 7 today.

396
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,738
Speaker 1: I've already beaten the game and so is red.

397
00:25:57,421 --> 00:26:09,092
Speaker 1: But I just unlocked level 7 today and I'm trying to collect all the big coins and I want to see just how much Replay value the game has before I give a final verdict with the geek nights episode.

398
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:17,458
Speaker 0: because for some reason I wonder if any Mario game can ever have the sheer replay value of Mario 3 Mario 3, which you suck at.

399
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,226
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm not that good at if you know what.

400
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,252
Speaker 0: I still fucking love the game.

401
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:23,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mario world It comes real close to.

402
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:24,671
Speaker 0: yeah, it does for some reason.

403
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,080
Speaker 0: I think Mario 3 is a tiny bit more replay value.

404
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just something about Mario 3 where the levels are hard.

405
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:37,458
Speaker 1: Yeah in Mario world You can learn how to unlock every level and just beat the hell out of everything with the capes and the Yoshi's.

406
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:42,552
Speaker 1: just kick its ass Mario 3 this stuff that's hard to get like stuff.

407
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:46,994
Speaker 1: You only get one shot at like Hammersuits and stuff and white mushroom houses.

408
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:56,499
Speaker 0: Yeah plus There are a limited number of resources in the game a limited number of one-ups and no way to save your game No way to turn around.

409
00:26:57,063 --> 00:26:58,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, not like Mario world.

410
00:26:58,713 --> 00:26:59,156
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

411
00:26:59,196 --> 00:26:59,800
Speaker 1: I need a mushroom.

412
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,000
Speaker 1: Let me go back back to top secret zone back to an easy level where they just mushrooms all over the place.

413
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:07,279
Speaker 0: You mean top secret zone the level you didn't know about?

414
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:10,700
Speaker 0: Yeah level that is nothing more than I didn't have a super Nintendo.

415
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:13,847
Speaker 1: That's why you suck at Mario 3.

416
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,733
Speaker 1: You're busy playing easy Mario world.

417
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:16,716
Speaker 0: I was too busy playing.

418
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:17,880
Speaker 0: fucking pilot wings.

419
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:26,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, bionic commando Yeah, Scott and I are good at different games, but the games were good at were frickin good at I mean Scott.

420
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,442
Speaker 0: You should see him.

421
00:27:27,503 --> 00:27:30,913
Speaker 1: He could probably speedrun Megaman - probably I haven't played in a while.

422
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,278
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can still do it.

423
00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:37,893
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway as you all know I was at an amazement over the weekend.

424
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,400
Speaker 0: amazing it was an amazing.

425
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:43,309
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say that every day all week.

426
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:44,956
Speaker 1: That is so corny.

427
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:45,377
Speaker 0: It is.

428
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:55,060
Speaker 0: it is Though I have a funny joke a funny thing about the name of the con From the musical that was put on at the con that I will say tomorrow.

429
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:56,214
Speaker 0: Okay.

430
00:27:56,457 --> 00:28:03,522
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway I just want to do a little quick talk about the video gaming that was on and about and actually a little bit of Board-gaming.

431
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:09,659
Speaker 0: at an amazement because as I did with katsu khan it worked very well to split the video gaming off into a separate day.

432
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:12,648
Speaker 1: Hmm was there any DDR actions?

433
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:13,591
Speaker 0: actually there was.

434
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:13,952
Speaker 0: now it.

435
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,564
Speaker 0: what an amazement is pretty much the biggest I small con can be.

436
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:21,820
Speaker 0: so the video game room was not large, but it was well run and well stocked.

437
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:26,728
Speaker 0: They had the guitar heroes Which we actually had constant play for the entire thing.

438
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:30,980
Speaker 1: every convention this year is just all about guitar heroes because it's really fun.

439
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you get that feeling you're playing it and you feel like you're playing the guitar even though you're really not.

440
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,980
Speaker 0: You're just playing just hitting colored buttons, but it's it's great.

441
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:43,660
Speaker 1: I mean everything from uber con to Otakon is gonna is rocking the guitar hero big-time.

442
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:51,529
Speaker 0: They had the DDR in the corner, which had a continuous line of play once again for the whole weekend though Surprising the machine or a pad a pad.

443
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:54,180
Speaker 0: actually very few cons have the machines anymore.

444
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,416
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Otakon has really never had the machines.

445
00:28:57,557 --> 00:29:00,447
Speaker 0: Nope Anime central always did so you know.

446
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:10,180
Speaker 1: what the thing is is that when they do the pads they tend to use a projector and stuff and The machines the real machines actually seem to take up less physical space.

447
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:11,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

448
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:14,219
Speaker 1: then the pads and all the ps2s and the wires and shit.

449
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:18,700
Speaker 1: So you know it's usually better to have the machines that also because they play better.

450
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:21,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do, but then you don't have all the custom things.

451
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:25,204
Speaker 1: no or like the step mania craziness No, but you can set that.

452
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:30,258
Speaker 1: or there are some people who have to have real arcade cabinets with computers and step mania inside.

453
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:34,395
Speaker 0: true Those guys are awesome, but the nice thing about the video game room is one.

454
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:39,264
Speaker 0: there was really no Oda-funk no Otafunk It didn't really there was all.

455
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:45,239
Speaker 0: there was very little Bo and an amazement despite the fact that it was like a thousand degrees and humid outside.

456
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:46,402
Speaker 1: Awesome.

457
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,493
Speaker 0: You know being in South Carolina your air-conditioned inside weren't you?

458
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,259
Speaker 0: the air conditioning could barely keep up.

459
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:58,559
Speaker 0: The dealer's room was the most air-conditioned as was one of the panel rooms But the rest of the con was actually kind of warm.

460
00:29:59,222 --> 00:29:59,703
Speaker 1: It says the thing.

461
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:04,720
Speaker 1: Otacon has those super mega industrial air conditioners of doom which have their own drawbacks.

462
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:09,180
Speaker 0: They suck the moisture out of you, and then you die and they have water everywhere.

463
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,169
Speaker 1: But it's so hard to find water when you need it.

464
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,197
Speaker 0: There was so much water.

465
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:13,780
Speaker 0: in an amazement.

466
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,606
Speaker 0: They were on that the video.

467
00:30:15,626 --> 00:30:20,160
Speaker 0: there were like 10 water kiosks within a two-minute walk of any point in the con.

468
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:20,944
Speaker 1: Awesome.

469
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,240
Speaker 0: the video game room was fully stocked with all that and they really planned.

470
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,358
Speaker 0: Well, the video game room was right next to the con suite which had drinks and snacks.

471
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:28,840
Speaker 0: awesome.

472
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:35,096
Speaker 0: So the people who weren't into the anime thing or were bored we're just kind of hover back and forth between the two until like 3 in the morning mm-hmm.

473
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,591
Speaker 0: and They had like they had a lot of game cubes.

474
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:41,325
Speaker 0: a lot of you know PlayStation Xbox just the typical game room run out.

475
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:49,000
Speaker 0: they had a good crew running the game room and Everyone was really I guess polite as in more polite than I've ever seen in an anime con.

476
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:52,350
Speaker 1: And the game is really the game room is the area of.

477
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:55,320
Speaker 1: in politeness yeah, and elite gamer tudes.

478
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:59,400
Speaker 0: I mean, it's really weird, but people always talk about southern hospitality.

479
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,024
Speaker 0: It's kind of true.

480
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:04,659
Speaker 0: I mean there were some people who were you know fanboys, but they were real polite about it.

481
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:06,208
Speaker 1: How did you?

482
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:06,937
Speaker 1: what do you?

483
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:15,080
Speaker 0: Your show sucks, but don't worry I'll come up with an example tomorrow of a terrible fanboy.

484
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,780
Speaker 0: I ran into who despite all that was very polite about being a terrible fanboy.

485
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:24,899
Speaker 1: I'm sorry that they smell so poorly and have terrible taste, and I'm a pervert, but that's just the way it is.

486
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:30,059
Speaker 0: Um how come when you're trying to do a polite person you have this pseudo British kind of thing.

487
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,417
Speaker 1: I don't know I'm trying to be froofy.

488
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,424
Speaker 0: Why is that froofy?

489
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:36,108
Speaker 1: I don't know what are you thinking?

490
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,833
Speaker 1: cuz I'm not polite.

491
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:38,655
Speaker 1: so I got it.

492
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:40,901
Speaker 0: look at that Homer Simpson with his Lottie.

493
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:44,775
Speaker 1: cuz I don't care about politeness, so if I'm gonna pretend to be polite I gotta be someone else.

494
00:31:45,096 --> 00:31:45,979
Speaker 0: so why British?

495
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:47,739
Speaker 1: Is it sound British?

496
00:31:48,383 --> 00:31:52,976
Speaker 0: I was just trying to be froofy boy.

497
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:01,269
Speaker 0: Okay right yeah, it's silliness now.

498
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:03,255
Speaker 0: the gaming room was really great and everyone's really polite.

499
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:04,680
Speaker 0: I ran into this guy.

500
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:05,859
Speaker 0: I didn't catch his name.

501
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:09,559
Speaker 0: He was apparently the Mac master of Marvel vs.

502
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,499
Speaker 0: Capcom and like no one could be Morris kept come one or two.

503
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:14,242
Speaker 0: I don't know Whatever.

504
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:15,026
Speaker 0: I didn't get to go in.

505
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:20,573
Speaker 0: I was actually guarding the door at the late at night Covering for someone who had to go do something for a while.

506
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:24,060
Speaker 0: You know security yep, and He retalked for a while.

507
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,910
Speaker 0: He was a really cool guy And he wanted to take me because I didn't believe him.

508
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:27,975
Speaker 0: like I'm not.

509
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:30,715
Speaker 0: I didn't actually not believe him But I was kind of a. you're really that good.

510
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:34,219
Speaker 0: He's like come on I'll show you I couldn't move, but was he like the world champion or something?

511
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:38,759
Speaker 0: I don't know, but apparently cuz I ran into some other people who pointed him out as being really really good.

512
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:44,220
Speaker 1: It could have been just the local awesome guy or the most awesome guy in the state or something like that.

513
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:45,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could have been but he was good, and he was cool.

514
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:50,374
Speaker 0: Basically everyone I met in that room was cool, and I interviewed a lot of people over there.

515
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:52,040
Speaker 0: mm-hmm almost no funk.

516
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:56,660
Speaker 0: Though the one odd thing was there weren't many DS's or PSP's at the con.

517
00:32:57,862 --> 00:32:59,108
Speaker 0: I mean most of the cons we go to.

518
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:02,120
Speaker 0: you'll see like crowds of DS players everywhere.

519
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:08,267
Speaker 0: yep at this con I ran into two people who had PSP's and They were talking to each other.

520
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:11,763
Speaker 0: actually I think they were either friends or brother and sister or something I really couldn't tell.

521
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:16,020
Speaker 0: I didn't have a chance to interview him, but they weren't really playing it out.

522
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:17,857
Speaker 0: They just kind of had it with them, and it was also their mp3 player.

523
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:30,004
Speaker 0: I ran into a bunch of people playing DS games, so I tried to play with them a little bit But they were all kind of busy and distracted And I was kind of tired that didn't really pan out And I was worried that there wasn't.

524
00:33:30,044 --> 00:33:36,139
Speaker 0: there wasn't so much DS action at this con that maybe if you move away from the Northeast The DS kind of falls out of favor.

525
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:47,770
Speaker 0: then standing in line Watching over the cosplay crowd waiting for everyone to get in I start hearing people yelling things things like oh my god the bomb.

526
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:58,845
Speaker 0: oh my god dangerous bomb bomb kick and I realized that there were about seven people scattered all over the line playing Bomberman and yelling and screaming Oh, yeah And they wouldn't give the game up.

527
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:06,576
Speaker 0: the line started moving in and they're all like holding their DS's up trying to keep the signal Going and they kept playing as the line walked into the building.

528
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:19,297
Speaker 0: awesome Eventually the last guy like at the end of the line stopped and bent down like he was gonna tie his shoe And then all of a sudden I heard all the rest of the guys from inside yell It was over.

529
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,147
Speaker 1: It's actually funny cuz today.

530
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,375
Speaker 1: I was you know the one random day.

531
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,186
Speaker 1: I look at the game facts poll It.

532
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:33,780
Speaker 1: the poll is which system Do you plan to buy your next video game for which I thought is a pretty interesting question to ask.

533
00:34:34,524 --> 00:34:38,110
Speaker 1: Number one was the ps2 with 28 29%.

534
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,766
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna round off to the nearest 1%.

535
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:43,743
Speaker 1: Okay The DS was in second place with 20%.

536
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:45,906
Speaker 1: the Xbox 360 was in third place with 15%.

537
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:54,143
Speaker 1: in fourth place the GameCube 9%.

538
00:34:54,143 --> 00:35:07,067
Speaker 1: you thought we were gonna say the PSP, but now the PC comes in next with 11% Then comes in other with 8% Then the PSP with 5% Wow.

539
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:10,115
Speaker 1: and then the Xbox one with 4%.

540
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:16,720
Speaker 1: so the DS 20% of gamers plan to buy their next game for the DS.

541
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,820
Speaker 1: 5% plan to buy their next game for the PSP.

542
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,605
Speaker 1: 4 to 1 people.

543
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:26,315
Speaker 1: and that's I rounded the PSP up and I rounded the DS down.

544
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:31,240
Speaker 1: the actual numbers are DS PSP 4.63%.

545
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:46,189
Speaker 1: so for every Four DS is out there or for every four people who are planning to buy a game for the DS real soon There is less than one person Planning to buy their next game for the PSP.

546
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,486
Speaker 0: now some people have pointed out that we seem to be very down on the PSP Pretty much any time it comes up.

547
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:53,253
Speaker 1: numbers people now.

548
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:54,176
Speaker 1: We're skeptics here.

549
00:35:54,216 --> 00:35:55,200
Speaker 1: We go by the evidence.

550
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:58,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, but just we're not saying it's a bad system.

551
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,207
Speaker 0: It's an awesome system.

552
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:08,780
Speaker 0: the same way the Game Gear was an awesome system and once again I still own my Game Gear and I wish it had been successful, but I knew it wouldn't be and it wasn't.

553
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:11,171
Speaker 0: But it still had some good games.

554
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,238
Speaker 0: I'm still glad I owned it.

555
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:16,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems the PSP is gonna even have less good games.

556
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, those Megaman games.

557
00:36:18,138 --> 00:36:18,820
Speaker 1: I kind of want to play.

558
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:22,233
Speaker 1: I know this is in the store a couple times But that's about it.

559
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:32,139
Speaker 0: Though actually I note how the ps2 is doing so well I wouldn't be surprised if the ps2 continued to outsell the ps3 for a time after the ps3 comes out.

560
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,500
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the ps1 outsold the ps2 for a time.

561
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:45,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know because the backwards compatibility people don't mind continuing on with the system They've got knowing that eventually they'll buy the new system and they'll be alright.

562
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:56,700
Speaker 0: But anyway, I have actually no more real gaming coverage of an amazement other than that I ran into a small group of people playing a German board game that they had bought at the dealers room at anime.

563
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,147
Speaker 0: What game was it some game?

564
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,680
Speaker 0: I never heard of and I actually didn't catch the name of it.

565
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:01,844
Speaker 1: Oh, hopefully you.

566
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:04,113
Speaker 1: so there was a guy selling German board games at an amazement.

567
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:05,178
Speaker 0: Yes, there was.

568
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:09,179
Speaker 0: well He was a gamer story was selling all sorts of game repair of an alien dice.

569
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:10,083
Speaker 0: He was.

570
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:11,588
Speaker 0: the thing is he wasn't selling.

571
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,819
Speaker 0: he wasn't a I don't know high quality German dealer.

572
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:15,663
Speaker 0: He's.

573
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:18,435
Speaker 0: he had mostly like the munchkin things the Steve Jackson things.

574
00:37:18,576 --> 00:37:19,440
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's the most of them.

575
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,626
Speaker 0: Yeah, the super popular American or euro games.

576
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:30,927
Speaker 1: the only way you can make money in that kind of business is to really sell the popular stuff big Time and the other stuff, you know You buy exactly as many as you're gonna sell

577
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:35,321
Speaker 0: or be millennium games in Rochester and have everything because you know, it'll all sell Yep.

578
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:35,723
Speaker 0: Yeah.

00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:49,011
Speaker 1: Oh I when I was at the Dragon's Den this weekend playing games Yeah the guy was like Apparently dragons that had gotten in a few copies of Kayla's and they sold out and they want it You know, the guy was like when are you gonna get more?

581
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,600
Speaker 1: You know the distributor is sold out and I'm like You should call this guy Ed and millennium games and ask him where he gets his board games from.

582
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz he's got like 10 copies of the damn thing.

Speaker 1: I'm like, oh and I spell the name weird It's like two ends.

585
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:10,068
Speaker 1: So the guy goes over to the computer and he finds the website and he's like 54 gaming tables.

586
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:11,294
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

587
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:11,797
Speaker 0: Yeah,

588
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:12,520
Speaker 1: and I'm like, yeah

589
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:13,994
Speaker 0: Yeah wrong

590
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:15,744
Speaker 1: with you mr Paintball cuz

591
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:24,400
Speaker 0: we we've we've always talked about it in front of this guy and with this guy and with all these Ma's guys that Our gaming store back in Rochester is probably one of the best gaming stores in the country

592
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,809
Speaker 1: As far as I'm concerned the best gaming store in the world.

593
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've ever seen not counting Germany.

594
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:33,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, as far as I can tell I haven't been to that complete strategist in the city.

595
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:34,100
Speaker 1: Maybe we should go there.

596
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should maybe when we go to that pillows concert or something.

597
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:37,615
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

598
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:37,796
Speaker 1: Yeah.

599
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,345
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, but yeah the get.

600
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:43,500
Speaker 0: the reason I don't remember the name of the game is that it didn't look very good.

601
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:50,313
Speaker 0: it just looked very big and complicated and weird and I tried to talk to the guys a little bit, but they were really kind.

602
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:59,380
Speaker 0: I mean if you guys are listening I'm sorry But you were really kind of unfriendly and you didn't seem to want anyone to ask What you were doing or pay any attention to the game you were trying.

603
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:03,073
Speaker 1: Oh, well, then they're not German board gamers your German real German board gamers.

604
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,136
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah.

605
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:12,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, check this shit out And they're talking all in funny accents and stuff, yep, but the thing the other thing was they had never heard of any game.

606
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,359
Speaker 0: I tried to ask him about, you know Tigers, New Freighties, Puerto Rico settlers never heard of any of those, huh?

607
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,134
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what they're German gamers.

608
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,940
Speaker 1: They were just some guys who bought some thing that they thought looked cool and we're trying to play it.

609
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,505
Speaker 1: That's probably why it's a game.

610
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:28,560
Speaker 1: You never heard of because they probably just bought it based on its looks or something.

611
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:29,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

612
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:30,800
Speaker 0: I mean, I wish they'd been friendly.

613
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:35,482
Speaker 0: I wanted to interview him, but they really didn't seem to want to talk to anyone at the con Assets.

614
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:35,984
Speaker 0: Yeah.

615
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:36,606
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

616
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:37,630
Speaker 1: Okay.

617
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,926
Speaker 0: So since rim talked about something I got one more tiny bit One more time a little bit.

618
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,540
Speaker 0: This is a our friend Nury who does artist Ally a podcast.

619
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:46,764
Speaker 0: She's appeared on the show.

620
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:51,840
Speaker 0: I believe once she will be appearing on it at some point in the future for another interesting episode.

621
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,588
Speaker 0: But she had an idea a long time ago.

622
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:58,436
Speaker 0: And when she told me this idea I said that's gold.

623
00:39:58,737 --> 00:39:59,760
Speaker 0: That is solid gold.

624
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:10,879
Speaker 0: She started making die earring dice an earring that is a like a d8 or a d20 and They look really good like just you know, drill a hole in dice and do all the stuff to it.

625
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,885
Speaker 1: You put a hook into it.

626
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:14,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, you put a hook with the chain and another hook.

627
00:40:14,482 --> 00:40:16,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that but she does it really well.

628
00:40:16,115 --> 00:40:16,720
Speaker 0: She knows what she's doing.

629
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,081
Speaker 0: They look for.

630
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:19,427
Speaker 0: they came out really well at the con.

631
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:20,951
Speaker 0: She'd made a few and was selling them.

632
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:26,972
Speaker 0: the demand was insane Not the you should see.

633
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:28,300
Speaker 1: how many do you make a website?

634
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,568
Speaker 0: I think that might be in the on the docket.

635
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:34,721
Speaker 1: now make a website with a little credit card thing and it made me very Happy.

636
00:40:34,782 --> 00:40:35,825
Speaker 0: the amount of geekery.

637
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:39,597
Speaker 0: just that how many people would walk up to the table see these dyes and go.

638
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:41,043
Speaker 0: Oh my god That's awesome.

639
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:43,051
Speaker 0: I have to buy them for my significant other.

640
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:43,754
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

641
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:44,357
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

642
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:44,839
Speaker 0: Do you have a d8?

643
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,167
Speaker 0: Do you have a d12?

644
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:46,972
Speaker 0: I want I need a d12.

645
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:47,999
Speaker 0: It has to be blue.

646
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:50,129
Speaker 1: I need a blue d12 for my blue.

647
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:54,312
Speaker 0: barbarian people were like if I give you some of my dice Will you turn them into earrings for me?

648
00:40:54,333 --> 00:41:00,580
Speaker 0: Yeah So I thought that was very cool that there was that much geekery going on at the con.

649
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:09,520
Speaker 0: Yep, that's that's the level of geekery I come to expect and of course my full coverage of an amazement will be tomorrow on anime day.

650
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:14,120
Speaker 0: I only say this because we seem to have picked up quite a few new listeners from an amazement.

651
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,718
Speaker 0: All right, and if you're waiting for it, it hasn't happened yet.

652
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:23,409
Speaker 1: so Since rim talked the first half of the main bit I'm gonna get the second half all to me.

653
00:41:24,072 --> 00:41:25,520
Speaker 1: Well rim will right chime in a whole bunch.

654
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:32,880
Speaker 1: Baba we baba we baba we okay, so we have a friend who plays this game called planets.

655
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:35,993
Speaker 0: I yeah our friend Adam aka art boy, you know him in the forums.

656
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:36,857
Speaker 0: He's really cool guy.

657
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:41,747
Speaker 1: Yep, so If you don't know planet side is it's.

658
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:47,863
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's officially the first and only but it's pretty much the main MMO.

659
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,407
Speaker 1: that's also an FPS.

660
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:54,060
Speaker 1: so it's you know, you run around shooting, but there's a whole bunch of people everywhere.

661
00:41:54,383 --> 00:42:04,660
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing I dreamt about When I was a kid like I dreamed of the day when something like this in theory You know looking at it from that standpoint an MMO FPS could be awesome.

662
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:08,010
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was always skeptical.

663
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,993
Speaker 1: I never liked it.

664
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:12,843
Speaker 1: I really really there's no MMOs that are good It's far.

665
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:15,939
Speaker 0: if you ask me, yeah, I mean puzzle pyre which is probably the best.

666
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:19,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, Kingdom of Loathing was barely M barely.

667
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:30,307
Speaker 1: So He probably tells us the last time he was hanging out that you know planet side is free and I'm like, oh really well Me not being a shit talker.

668
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:31,751
Speaker 1: I guess isn't really shit talking.

669
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:33,517
Speaker 1: But you know, I don't knock it.

670
00:42:33,577 --> 00:42:36,027
Speaker 1: before I tried it Let me tell you I could say that.

671
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,855
Speaker 1: so I went and tried it.

672
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:42,510
Speaker 1: now I'm gonna say some pretty negative things.

673
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:47,468
Speaker 1: So Adam before you Come and tell me how I'm wrong and stupid.

674
00:42:47,488 --> 00:42:51,240
Speaker 1: Let me tell you I gave this game more chances than it deserved.

675
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:56,540
Speaker 1: I played it on two separate days for hours and hours each day.

676
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,259
Speaker 0: I can verify this because I heard him in his room.

677
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:02,450
Speaker 0: This is what I'd hear I'd hear click click click click click.

678
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:03,694
Speaker 0: What the fuck.

679
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:05,160
Speaker 0: click click click click click.

680
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,299
Speaker 0: Oh, this is just bullshit.

681
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:09,387
Speaker 0: Rim you got to see this crap.

682
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:11,695
Speaker 0: click click click click click click click click.

683
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,320
Speaker 1: God, it won't even work All right.

684
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:21,752
Speaker 1: So I made a list of every time I went like that now normally under normal circumstances The first time the game pissed me off.

685
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:23,480
Speaker 1: I would have uninstalled it and that would have been the end.

686
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,054
Speaker 1: Because you know, I wanted to give it a fair chance before I'm burping all over the place.

687
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:31,899
Speaker 0: I'm not editing that out.

688
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:49,819
Speaker 1: Okay Before I wanted to give it a fair chance before I talked about it, so I sat through all this pain and suffering before compiling my final list of grievances and why I think planetside is Terrible and shouldn't be played by anyone and no one should pay money for it ever.

689
00:43:50,803 --> 00:44:04,309
Speaker 0: Now I will qualify his stuff by saying that I think the reason that art boys Experienced with this game are so much better at least in his eyes are mainly that he plays with a bunch of people He knows and almost anything is fun.

690
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:10,092
Speaker 1: If you play it with a bunch of people, you know, yeah, you know It's a mob mentality, you know, you do something.

691
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:12,798
Speaker 1: I mean, let's say I'm jumping up and down It's not cool.

692
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:19,740
Speaker 1: But if all of a sudden 50 people are jumping up and down with me and we all tell each other jumping up and down Is awesome jumping up and down is awesome.

693
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:22,840
Speaker 1: That's the whole point of guilds in World of Warcraft.

694
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,900
Speaker 1: It's not any different than playing World of Warcraft on your own.

695
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,112
Speaker 1: All you do is click on the monster until it dies.

696
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:29,460
Speaker 1: click on the monster until it died.

697
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,212
Speaker 0: Now you've got someone else also clicking on the monster or clicking on.

698
00:44:32,232 --> 00:44:34,441
Speaker 1: you both look at each other and say this is awesome Isn't it?

699
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:37,051
Speaker 1: and you both you tell each other that it's great and it becomes great.

700
00:44:37,432 --> 00:44:38,476
Speaker 1: It's a psychology thing.

701
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:39,399
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong with that.

702
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:45,011
Speaker 1: Nope, as long as you recognize You know, we do it all the time to look at us right here.

703
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:47,200
Speaker 1: Just telling each other everything we do is awesome.

704
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,826
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we're so awesome.

705
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:51,355
Speaker 1: We just can't podcast isn't making a geek podcast.

706
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:51,817
Speaker 1: Awesome.

707
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:55,729
Speaker 1: It's freaking fantastic Alright, so here's the I'm gonna this.

708
00:44:55,749 --> 00:45:00,945
Speaker 1: I just kind of scrawled every time something pissed me off enough to pick up the pen And stop looking at the game.

709
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:02,510
Speaker 1: So let's see.

710
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,818
Speaker 1: First of all the load times.

711
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:06,942
Speaker 1: now I'm gonna.

712
00:45:06,962 --> 00:45:13,038
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be apologetic for every one of these just to be you know, I guess less than super.

713
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:15,871
Speaker 0: this sucks But it seems to suck.

714
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:16,496
Speaker 1: it does so.

715
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:18,767
Speaker 1: The load times.

716
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:27,216
Speaker 1: it might just be my shitty computer But my computer isn't that shitty my computer it plays half-life 2 like a dream.

717
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:30,345
Speaker 0: your computer remember Planet-side is kind of old.

718
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:31,408
Speaker 1: It is kind of old.

719
00:45:31,508 --> 00:45:35,540
Speaker 0: your computer is more powerful than anything that existed when planet-side appeared.

720
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:38,328
Speaker 1: Yep Now I don't care about graphics and games.

721
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:43,298
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned as long as the graphics don't interfere with the gameplay They're all good.

722
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:49,733
Speaker 1: but Planet-side has shittier graphics than half-life 2 shittier physics than half-life 2. hell.

723
00:45:50,034 --> 00:46:03,053
Speaker 1: it has shittier physics and graphics than tribes 2 Or maybe equal and the load times were preposterous Absolutely insane, I mean half-life 2 has a bit of a load time on my computer this.

724
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,520
Speaker 1: the load times are double if not more.

725
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:07,850
Speaker 1: Now the worst part of the load times.

726
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,798
Speaker 1: cuz I you know, I sat through it.

727
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:11,899
Speaker 1: There was no cancel button.

728
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:16,500
Speaker 1: So as soon as I started loading I was stuck until it finished loading.

729
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:21,299
Speaker 0: Granted the quake 2 and the first half-life had a little bit of problem with that.

730
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:26,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, where if you started to do something you were basically stuck until it finished before you go again.

731
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:30,320
Speaker 1: But you think this is an MMO that's constantly patched and updated.

732
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:36,360
Speaker 1: someone would have complained about the incredible load times and why there's no cancel button and they would have put a cancel button in by.

733
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,100
Speaker 1: Now after years and years of this game being out and there's no cancel button if you if you start loading something.

734
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,970
Speaker 1: So that's the first time is any time I did anything.

735
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,679
Speaker 1: the load was insane and it wasn't worth waiting.

736
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:54,300
Speaker 1: through number two When you join the game, it gives you a choice of teams and there's three teams.

737
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,547
Speaker 1: You can join at least three teams that I saw.

738
00:46:56,787 --> 00:46:58,412
Speaker 1: the team that needs players.

739
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:00,820
Speaker 1: you get an XP bonus if you join that team.

740
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:06,380
Speaker 1: I guess that's a good incentive for getting people to join the team with the least players.

741
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:11,558
Speaker 1: But doesn't that kind of give sort of an unfair advantage to one of the teams?

742
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,000
Speaker 1: I don't know.

743
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,933
Speaker 0: Well, that team's probably already down.

744
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Don't know.

745
00:47:17,063 --> 00:47:17,708
Speaker 1: You know it did.

746
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,540
Speaker 1: it seemed like an okay thing.

747
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:20,927
Speaker 1: It's not really a plus or a minus.

748
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:23,420
Speaker 1: it is kind of there and I don't you know.

749
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,759
Speaker 1: I'm just kind of skeptical of it a little bit, you know, I need to see more.

750
00:47:29,402 --> 00:47:29,965
Speaker 1: Alright, let's see.

751
00:47:30,186 --> 00:47:32,299
Speaker 1: Okay the training portion of the game.

752
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,660
Speaker 1: So you join the game and it does this awesome training thing.

753
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:42,272
Speaker 1: The training is an awesome thing on the left side on the right side of the screen I think it says do this do that.

754
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:44,239
Speaker 1: and it even tells you what buttons to push and everything.

755
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:49,836
Speaker 1: and As you do those things it puts a green checkbox and then tells you to do the next thing.

756
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:51,120
Speaker 1: it was perfect.

757
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,168
Speaker 1: It taught me a whole bunch of stuff about the game.

758
00:47:53,831 --> 00:48:01,885
Speaker 1: The problem is after about Oh five different things that I did it Said okay do instant action.

759
00:48:02,306 --> 00:48:06,115
Speaker 1: now instant action is this thing where you say instant action.

760
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:10,752
Speaker 1: and because it's a giant giant world With not so many players covering the entire world.

761
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:12,760
Speaker 1: There isn't fighting going on everywhere.

762
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:22,668
Speaker 1: In fact, if you go to certain places you can just walk around in this monotonous wilderness forever and ever and ever and never meet anyone Unless you try to mess something up like a base.

763
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:23,591
Speaker 1: then they'll come after you.

764
00:48:23,631 --> 00:48:25,719
Speaker 1: but you know most of the time you'll just.

765
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,560
Speaker 1: you Know you just walk around the middle of nowhere.

766
00:48:28,122 --> 00:48:33,419
Speaker 1: So the fighting is going on only in a few places around the world and certain continents and things.

767
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:37,964
Speaker 1: So instant action immediately teleports you well Not immediately.

768
00:48:38,105 --> 00:48:50,800
Speaker 1: you push instant action then you can't touch anything for like five seconds And if you manage to successfully do that, it'll teleport you somewhere with a long loading time Of course where there is fighting going on.

769
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,028
Speaker 1: The tutorial told me to click instant action.

770
00:48:54,068 --> 00:48:54,489
Speaker 1: So I did.

771
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:56,395
Speaker 1: it sent me somewhere.

772
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:58,000
Speaker 1: I came out of a spawn point.

773
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,224
Speaker 1: It was immediately killed.

774
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:04,420
Speaker 1: The tutorial was thus over and I didn't learn anything else about the game.

775
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:09,479
Speaker 1: I don't think it was going to teach me anything else about the game anyway And I barely learned shit.

776
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:11,870
Speaker 1: Like I knew how to walk and shoot.

777
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:15,018
Speaker 1: if I didn't know how to play an FPS already I would have been dead in the water.

778
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:23,055
Speaker 1: you know It was like the greatest tutorial software and system in the universe that stopped teaching you after.

779
00:49:23,116 --> 00:49:25,000
Speaker 1: it taught you less than the basics.

780
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,776
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see what else we got here.

781
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,399
Speaker 1: Okay, so Their ads in this game.

782
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:43,379
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's because I don't pay for it and there weren't ads all over the game But in the bases were ads for castrol motor oil.

783
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,839
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, I don't think that needs anything else to be said about.

784
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,310
Speaker 0: Wow is?

785
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:54,258
Speaker 1: it seems that I?

786
00:49:55,547 --> 00:50:03,485
Speaker 1: there are a lot of Systems in the game that just aren't explained to you and I wasn't about to read all the giant Documentation to play an FPS.

787
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:09,860
Speaker 1: I figured out everything there is possibly is in half-life 2 and tribes 2 without reading any documentation whatsoever.

788
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:13,760
Speaker 1: So why should this FPS be any more complicated?

789
00:50:16,641 --> 00:50:23,446
Speaker 1: Apparently when you jump there's this little meter that goes down and then slowly rebuilds I guess to limit your jumping.

790
00:50:23,928 --> 00:50:29,633
Speaker 1: and when you jump your guy grunts like he's in pain yeah, and you can hurt yourself by jumping it seems.

791
00:50:29,713 --> 00:50:34,571
Speaker 1: and nowhere in the Guides or any, you know tutorial stuff that I read.

792
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,880
Speaker 1: Did it really explain what this was?

793
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:45,374
Speaker 1: I would have had to look up exactly how this little I guess energy meter worked and Exactly what used it and all that shit.

794
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,460
Speaker 1: What the hell?

795
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,399
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't mind it being there and you know I don't know the game mechanics of it because it didn't tell me it's just there.

796
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,100
Speaker 1: There's a lot of stuff on the screen.

797
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,346
Speaker 1: It's just there and it's never explained.

798
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:01,540
Speaker 1: and you have to read complicated documentation in a complicated format to figure it out.

799
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:05,347
Speaker 1: and for an FPS Hell no, I'm not reading that shit.

800
00:51:05,387 --> 00:51:08,479
Speaker 1: Maybe for a civilization, you know type game or an RTS.

801
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:11,954
Speaker 1: I'll read stuff not for an FPS and an FPS I walk and shoot.

802
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:12,778
Speaker 1: That's it.

803
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:20,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, even for a game like civilization I mean The only things I read were as I played the game I'd read the text around things and figure out what was going on.

804
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:26,544
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I would never read something before I played this game provided some help text For certain things.

805
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:39,419
Speaker 1: like you'd walk up to something for the first time and it would say this is this you use it this way, you know and that was kind of helpful, but It's like if I never came across something I would never know what it was or how to use it.

806
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:44,953
Speaker 1: And there's this VR room where you can go and try out all the weapons and vehicles in the game.

807
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:46,156
Speaker 1: Oh the vehicles.

808
00:51:46,176 --> 00:51:49,870
Speaker 1: I Don't know if there maybe isn't a button to do it.

809
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,160
Speaker 1: But when you're driving a vehicle, you can't look around.

810
00:51:52,942 --> 00:52:04,686
Speaker 1: So all you can see is straightforward where you're driving Which I thought was very very annoying Because I like to look behind me and to the left is the right to make sure no one's sneaking up on me To you know blow my vehicle up.

811
00:52:05,308 --> 00:52:07,236
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a button that does that but I don't know.

812
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:07,899
Speaker 1: it didn't tell me.

813
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,666
Speaker 1: now Let's see.

814
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:11,599
Speaker 1: What else is terrible?

815
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,564
Speaker 1: Okay here.

816
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:16,580
Speaker 1: I'm gonna cut it short and just stick with the major complaints.

817
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,944
Speaker 1: Running really sucks.

818
00:52:19,145 --> 00:52:20,469
Speaker 1: How do you run an FPS rim?

819
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:23,559
Speaker 0: I hold down my fire button and I'm automatically running.

820
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:26,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, now how do you walk slowly?

821
00:52:26,688 --> 00:52:30,237
Speaker 1: I hold down shift and then you also go forward right?

822
00:52:30,297 --> 00:52:32,317
Speaker 1: Yeah in this game It doesn't work like that.

823
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:36,030
Speaker 1: Okay, if you hold down forward you walk.

824
00:52:36,411 --> 00:52:38,517
Speaker 1: All right, if you let go forward you don't walk.

825
00:52:38,878 --> 00:52:42,669
Speaker 1: All right There's a button that you push that enables running.

826
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,280
Speaker 1: you push it and your gut just once it's sort of like caps lock.

827
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:50,389
Speaker 1: you push it and your guy starts running and You push it again and he stops running.

828
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:54,580
Speaker 1: All right, it's not too bad Yeah, but it was really annoying.

829
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:58,540
Speaker 0: I guess it's more like is the game set up so that running is a means of transport?

830
00:52:58,721 --> 00:52:59,344
Speaker 0: But it's not.

831
00:52:59,586 --> 00:53:00,872
Speaker 0: you don't use that when you're fighting.

832
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:12,791
Speaker 1: I Really don't know because whenever I got into a fight and there were a lot of guys in the screen the game was incredibly laggy and bleh and I couldn't really aim it.

833
00:53:12,852 --> 00:53:13,578
Speaker 1: guys.

834
00:53:13,598 --> 00:53:23,531
Speaker 1: and Yeah, and I don't know, you know people have said about this game, you know, oh, it doesn't matter what level you are You just have the right equipment to counter your enemy.

835
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:41,600
Speaker 1: Well, I Was a brand new guy and I got a bunch of levels by doing the VR and I had a whole bunch of equipment at my disposal and I tried all sorts of different loadouts and No matter what I chose Everyone seemed to do a billion damage to me and I couldn't really damage anyone worth a shit.

836
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:47,380
Speaker 1: So I'm beginning to think that level and all that stuff has a lot more to do with it than you would think.

837
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:49,766
Speaker 1: Maybe you haven't been a noob in a while.

838
00:53:49,786 --> 00:53:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe you know, you can deal with the lag that happens whenever you're near anyone.

839
00:53:56,305 --> 00:53:58,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean seriously half-life was the end of lag.

840
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:05,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the time in which they realized they could have netcode that fixed lives to worked perfectly on a 56k modem.

841
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:07,358
Speaker 1: I shit you not.

842
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:11,612
Speaker 1: Therefore this game on my cable modem should have been slick as hell.

843
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:15,341
Speaker 1: I had pings to the server of less than 30.

844
00:54:15,341 --> 00:54:17,612
Speaker 1: Fuck you if there's lag there should never be lag.

845
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:19,159
Speaker 1: if there's lag something's wrong.

846
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,573
Speaker 1: Now and it's not me either.

847
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:24,402
Speaker 1: my ping was 30.

848
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:28,316
Speaker 1: It was sudden with the server and my remember my computer plays half-life 2. just fine.

849
00:54:28,357 --> 00:54:29,260
Speaker 1: My computer isn't slow.

850
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,707
Speaker 1: Hmm all right the full scan You install.

851
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:36,820
Speaker 1: I installed the game and the way the game installs.

852
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:40,050
Speaker 1: This is incredibly long download of gigs and gigs and gigs of data.

853
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,520
Speaker 1: That's understandable because it's a big game and I'm downloading the whole thing.

854
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,885
Speaker 1: Okay The second time I played the game.

855
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:56,834
Speaker 1: It did a full scan that I could not cancel or skip where it went and rescanned Every single file in the entire game.

856
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:58,080
Speaker 1: It took like 10 minutes.

857
00:54:58,702 --> 00:55:02,075
Speaker 1: I guess it was making sure I wasn't cheating or making sure the files weren't broken.

858
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:08,160
Speaker 1: I Don't know what it was doing, but it basically made me wait forever before I even started the game.

859
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:15,530
Speaker 1: So I didn't even encounter the first incredibly long load time and I was already waiting Like 10 minutes just to start the damn game.

860
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:16,855
Speaker 0: Well, you're a very patient man.

861
00:55:16,895 --> 00:55:18,200
Speaker 0: That would have been enough for me to quit.

862
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:21,930
Speaker 1: Yep, I would have told you I gave this game a chance.

863
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,334
Speaker 1: I gave it a serious chance.

864
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:25,440
Speaker 1: a friend says try this game.

865
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,328
Speaker 1: It's free and I like it a lot.

866
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,899
Speaker 1: I fucking tried it and it sucks ass.

867
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,845
Speaker 1: No one should pay for planet side.

868
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:36,375
Speaker 1: It's terrible terrible terrible bad bad old game.

869
00:55:36,395 --> 00:55:47,199
Speaker 0: I don't know why it's still alive Now if you make We're talking specifically to you Adam or anyone else out there who listens as a fan of planet side and audio rebuttal will play it.

870
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,188
Speaker 0: Yep, we want to hear an argument.

871
00:55:49,228 --> 00:55:50,535
Speaker 0: We want you to defend your game.

872
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:58,220
Speaker 1: Yeah Kotaku had that great thing after III at e3 where they went around to the game developers and said justify your game.

873
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,330
Speaker 1: So yeah justify this game.

874
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:07,793
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned as an FPS It's mediocre as an MMO.

875
00:56:07,813 --> 00:56:13,064
Speaker 1: It's nothing as a game Technologically speaking.

876
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:14,148
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

877
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:17,300
Speaker 0: It sounds like I would rather play World of Warcraft than that.

878
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:24,032
Speaker 1: I probably would rather play World of Warcraft cuz at least World of Warcraft works Works really well on many platforms.

879
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:25,217
Speaker 0: Well to plan max.

880
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:33,348
Speaker 1: Yeah The other thing the combat in this game was even were I prefer the halo combat to this I mean you really didn't.

881
00:56:33,449 --> 00:56:35,880
Speaker 1: you couldn't jump or duck duck.

882
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,485
Speaker 1: It didn't really help strategically like in a counter-strike way, but you couldn't move fast and do awesome moves in a quake sort of way.

883
00:56:43,505 --> 00:56:55,904
Speaker 1: it was just walk around and Find the bad guys and click at them in a slow and boring sort of way like less than what Wolfenstein 3d only slower Wow, you just.

884
00:56:55,984 --> 00:57:03,859
Speaker 1: what all you could really do was pick the right weapon choose the right ammunition for the weapon Walk around find the bad guys point and shoot at them.

885
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:12,905
Speaker 1: The only strategy seemed to be on a more than one person level as in Get a bunch of people to all do it together And that's the strategy.

886
00:57:12,985 --> 00:57:22,500
Speaker 1: is you know get a bunch of people to choose the right weapon and then hold the button down Aiming in the same general which I mean, I guess it's cool because that's the point, you know squad combat and all that.

887
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:32,524
Speaker 0: But it makes it so that The game is just units like large units of people moving around and the only people who really have a fun game now are the Commanders who tell people where to go.

888
00:57:32,965 --> 00:57:34,610
Speaker 0: they're the ones playing the strategy game.

889
00:57:34,971 --> 00:57:39,002
Speaker 0: if you're not doing that you're just no FPS skill Involved.

890
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:41,168
Speaker 1: imagine if it was FPS skill.

891
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:44,658
Speaker 1: then three awesome dudes with you know pistols.

892
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:45,400
Speaker 1: could you know?

893
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,260
Speaker 1: Take out some crazy awesome guys like in tribes.

894
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,537
Speaker 0: This completely eliminates that possibility.

895
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:58,790
Speaker 0: Scott and I could freaking like the two of us alone capture a flag if the other team wasn't so great or Depending on the server where you know, he'd.

896
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:01,040
Speaker 0: he'd bombed the generators with his satchel charge.

897
00:58:01,502 --> 00:58:04,774
Speaker 0: I'd fly over and like grab the flag and then I was a heavy.

898
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,969
Speaker 0: then I toss it to him he'd get on a speeder Bike and speed away and I'd sit there mortaring everyone.

899
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:09,230
Speaker 1: Yep.

900
00:58:09,271 --> 00:58:11,840
Speaker 1: There really is no as far as I'm concerned.

901
00:58:11,941 --> 00:58:13,780
Speaker 1: There is no FPS skill.

902
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:17,280
Speaker 1: There's no room for any FPS skill whatsoever in planetside.

903
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:23,579
Speaker 1: The only things that make a difference in this game are number of people on your side in proximity to you.

904
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:33,979
Speaker 1: There's selection of weapons and the selection and what weapons you've selected and how many you have available to you and what vehicles you brought With you and what bases are nearby?

905
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:40,440
Speaker 1: You know and all that sort of shit, which is really good if you suck at FPS is like FPS.

906
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,270
Speaker 1: This is awesome for you.

907
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:42,692
Speaker 1: Actually.

908
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:44,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is really good game for Luke.

909
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:49,900
Speaker 0: He really liked being the commander in a natural selection Yeah, but it doesn't seem like there's a commanding interface.

910
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,059
Speaker 1: the only type of commanding you can do is call your friends and say hey get on service just talk to people.

911
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:58,145
Speaker 1: and The other thing is this game.

912
00:58:58,426 --> 00:59:02,440
Speaker 1: the one thing that bothered me the most actually is in the game.

913
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:09,304
Speaker 1: Every game has lingo, you know, like if I come up to you and say they nerf something, you know You don't know what that is.

914
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:14,547
Speaker 1: Unless you're a gamer, you know in the world of Warcraft is all kinds of you know Go that means resurrecting.

915
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:17,240
Speaker 0: got a hearth gank 45 l whatever bullshit.

916
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:26,765
Speaker 1: This game had a lingo But it seemed that the documentation for the game used the lingo and the game itself used the lingo as well as all the players And nowhere did it.

917
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:30,000
Speaker 1: the lingo didn't make sense and no one taught it to you and the game.

918
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:34,658
Speaker 1: The documentation talked to you in lingo of the game before teaching it to you.

919
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:41,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, now compare that to natural selection where the lingo was one it did like incredibly obvious.

920
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:43,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone would say alright guys heavy train and you.

921
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:45,620
Speaker 0: and if anyone thought what does that mean?

922
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:49,359
Speaker 0: Suddenly a bunch of heavy armor starts appearing and everyone forms a massive line.

923
00:59:49,841 --> 00:59:57,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, there would basically be messages constantly popping up saying go to the weird name bla bla bla bla bla.

924
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:01,411
Speaker 1: and And I tried to do some stuff that people told me to do.

925
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:04,521
Speaker 1: like occasionally people try to help me and they say go to Res.

926
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:05,404
Speaker 1: how would?

927
01:00:05,726 --> 01:00:10,965
Speaker 1: and I'd be like where people look on your map and I'd look on my map and I'd say, okay I see it on my map.

928
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,732
Speaker 1: Where am I on the map?

929
01:00:12,772 --> 01:00:14,820
Speaker 1: Cuz I couldn't find the thing that said you are here.

930
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,127
Speaker 1: They're like, you're the arrow.

931
01:00:16,187 --> 01:00:22,871
Speaker 1: I'm like, there are three arrows on this map And then they'd be like go to where the number three is.

932
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,328
Speaker 1: I'm like this two or three number threes Which one the big one?

933
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:33,320
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm gonna try, you know, yeah And then it just I'll compare that to natural selection where you say go to reactor core.

934
01:00:33,602 --> 01:00:35,655
Speaker 0: You look on your map and you see reactor core.

935
01:00:35,897 --> 01:00:47,717
Speaker 1: you see Hovering holographic reactor core in the direction of the reactor and you see a picture of you with a little thing that looks just like Your radar, you know, the interface of this game was pretty much bad overall.

936
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:53,740
Speaker 1: the way, you know You close a window and then it's almost impossible to figure out how to open that exact window again.

937
01:00:54,249 --> 01:01:05,960
Speaker 1: and the way the because the heads of display is a bunch of little tiny windows and they all work in a non intuitive way and And the controls can't be customized the way I want.

938
01:01:06,382 --> 01:01:08,992
Speaker 0: You know, I'm glad my video card died.

939
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,879
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I would have been playing this game with you.

940
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:21,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Recently the new PC game I'm giving a chance is the bang howdy Which is the new game from the puzzle pirates guys.

941
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:22,260
Speaker 0: It looks kind of cool.

942
01:01:22,661 --> 01:01:26,980
Speaker 1: It looks kind of cool, but I played it today and the beta and I was a little bit disappointed.

943
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:28,872
Speaker 1: So I'll get back to that in some other day.

944
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:36,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, give us a couple weeks Yep, and on that note we went long today Which is fine because you all keep demanding longer and longer episodes.

945
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:38,297
Speaker 1: That's fine.

946
01:01:38,317 --> 01:01:39,320
Speaker 1: That's fine.

947
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:41,055
Speaker 1: So do you want to go watch that movie or in good bed?

948
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:41,580
Speaker 0: I don't know.

949
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,286
Speaker 0: Let me do the post-production and then see.

950
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:51,155
