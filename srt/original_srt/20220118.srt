00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:15,678
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:18,805
Speaker 0: It's my birthday, and we're gonna review inscription.

4
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:20,449
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:24,349
Speaker 1: I Don't know how you're how you're still here with such a birthday.

6
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,882
Speaker 1: Are you supposed to like go off into the whatever the carousel or something?

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,208
Speaker 0: so because I turned 40 what is the end?

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,619
Speaker 0: I was planning it.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,788
Speaker 1: I gotta make a phone call.

10
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:46,200
Speaker 0: we got At least so what I'm happy about is that as I turn 40 I am now better at DDR than I've ever been in my entire life.

11
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:47,893
Speaker 1: That's all right.

12
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:51,686
Speaker 1: that on your tombstone got somehow got better at DDR when 40.

13
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,693
Speaker 0: yep like you know You know how I know this profound difference.

14
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,436
Speaker 0: get this nowadays.

15
00:00:56,536 --> 00:01:00,092
Speaker 0: when I think of fourth mix what I think of is It does.

16
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:04,208
Speaker 0: the arrows are really simplistic like I've got a most of fourth mix generalized at this point.

17
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,816
Speaker 0: and What fourth mix think of thinks of?

18
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:08,080
Speaker 0: as a hard song?

19
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:10,408
Speaker 0: it's just arrows in weird places like.

20
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:11,110
Speaker 0: they're easy to do.

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,509
Speaker 0: They're just hard to read, but I remember when we were deep playing DDR.

22
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:23,899
Speaker 0: We really didn't like six mix like six mix was like the weird one We didn't like and then we didn't like the music yeah, so uh Revisiting six mix.

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,350
Speaker 0: now that I'm crazy good.

24
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,321
Speaker 0: I think those are the best DDR songs there ever were.

25
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:33,446
Speaker 1: in terms of the arrows matching the music I mean maybe but I just don't like the music itself.

26
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:36,153
Speaker 1: yeah, but these About the.

27
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:37,998
Speaker 1: I didn't give a shit about the arrows right.

28
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:44,822
Speaker 1: it was just if you took the fourth mix music and put you know The current mix arrow technology on there.

29
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,610
Speaker 1: You know I would like that.

30
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:50,387
Speaker 0: I think you could remake really good arrows for some of those songs that are gonna out proper 9-footer.

31
00:01:51,294 --> 00:02:01,959
Speaker 1: I think it's mostly Actual songs themselves even if they even if DDR fourth mix had first mix arrows which were garbage awful unplayable Didn't even match the music right.

32
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:06,638
Speaker 1: I would still prefer that because for me I cared about what song it was more than I cared about.

33
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:13,459
Speaker 0: but a lot of those fourth mix songs have updated versions and later DDRs with way better arrows - that's that's nice.

34
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:14,401
Speaker 0: That's a lot of them.

35
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,065
Speaker 0: that eighth mix and ninth mix.

36
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,449
Speaker 0: really have that going on.

37
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,536
Speaker 1: I'm just really disappointed.

38
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:27,906
Speaker 1: They don't you know for obvious technical licensing reasons They don't release DDR everything which has every single song.

39
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:28,789
Speaker 0: I mean it's that exists.

40
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:31,322
Speaker 0: It's called step mania plus, but it's not.

41
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:32,749
Speaker 0: you went to DDR Spain once.

42
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,035
Speaker 1: It's not perfect right.

43
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,280
Speaker 1: it's not the real ever you know.

44
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,630
Speaker 1: It's like I have every NES ROM ever.

45
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,907
Speaker 1: But if Nintendo's you know thing was like you know they have like a few measly games on the switch online.

46
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,091
Speaker 1: right if they were Like?

47
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:53,858
Speaker 1: no, this is actually every NES ROM ever for real this time Even though I have that already.

48
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,022
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

49
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:56,889
Speaker 1: You know I'll go in for it.

50
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:03,794
Speaker 1: You know an official DDR that had every song ever would be preferable to The other thing.

51
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:09,046
Speaker 0: I noticed that and then we'll get on to the rest of the show is that of all the mixes fifth mix.

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:17,710
Speaker 0: Honestly despite the fact that I really liked the music in fifth mix I think it has the worst arrows of any like DDR after a third mix when everything changed.

53
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:21,110
Speaker 1: What I liked about fifth mix you know it had some good songs.

54
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,725
Speaker 1: You know it had the long songs.

55
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:24,509
Speaker 0: I really like that.

56
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of those are okay.

57
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:29,527
Speaker 1: the thing I liked about fifth mix actually the most was just like the.

58
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,850
Speaker 1: the interface Wasn't the last one to have the characters also.

59
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:38,016
Speaker 0: I think I mean I don't know cuz I haven't played everything on step mania for so long And I don't have the characters or anything.

60
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:41,070
Speaker 1: so yeah, I think fifth mix was the last one that had like the characters.

61
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:41,782
Speaker 1: it was just like.

62
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:45,240
Speaker 1: You know the aesthetic of it the you the UI.

63
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,110
Speaker 1: you know the yeah the the menu music.

64
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,909
Speaker 0: You know I mean even my DDR.

65
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:59,665
Speaker 0: I've got to the point to where I Change the arrows to be like the fourth mix style arrows just with better color because I don't like the arrow styles from later mixes either.

66
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:03,462
Speaker 0: Never mind that 1.5 X. that just sucks like I play.

67
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:05,610
Speaker 0: you got to play in 1x speed anyway.

68
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:17,260
Speaker 0: They're having fun with that, but what I actually did for my birthday is Basically I beat Zelda 2 again for the heck of it cuz I just have it on the switch And I can beat that game pretty quick at this point.

69
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,829
Speaker 0: I mostly remember where everything is and I still like that game.

70
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:26,716
Speaker 0: It holds up, okay Okay Enjoy.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,106
Speaker 1: yeah

72
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:46,130
Speaker 0: I mean this really enjoy it more than Zelda 1, but I think that's just partly Because Zelda 1 is a game where I have memorized everything and execution doesn't really become Difficult in Zelda 1 until you get to like the final dungeons when there's like seven blue nights in the room.

73
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,156
Speaker 1: Zelda 1 is not an execution game.

74
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:48,657
Speaker 1: It's a.

75
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,445
Speaker 0: you know it's a burn every bush game.

76
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:58,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I well Hopefully you've already burned every bush and that into your memory so you don't have to burn them again.

77
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,796
Speaker 0: You know I was playing Zelda 1 the other day just a little bit And it was scary to me how.

78
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:04,850
Speaker 0: if I think now like where are all the secrets I'd be hard-pressed to list them all.

79
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:09,508
Speaker 0: But if I'm in the game, I see a screen and my brain is just like burn that bush right there.

80
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one.

81
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:18,816
Speaker 1: There's a couple screens that look similar that like have two bushes, and it's like you want to burn the bottom one But I think on the other screen.

82
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:21,970
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, there isn't a secret on the bottom bush on one of them.

83
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, that really burns you.

84
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:27,130
Speaker 0: in second quest though where every secret you think you remember is just a door charge.

85
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:35,910
Speaker 1: Well second quest not only that but it also gets you because there's a lot of flute screens Or you flute and a secret appears instead of a tornado, and there's a lot of screen.

86
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,116
Speaker 1: There's a lot of walk through the the the wall where it's you just walk And it this is.

87
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:44,010
Speaker 0: I only learned about that from I want to say Nintendo Power.

88
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,288
Speaker 1: Oh, I knew about the one.

89
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,925
Speaker 1: well There was the one in the top right.

90
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:57,363
Speaker 1: in The first quest you get the big money right and then in the second quest I Discovered one of those because I looked at the map.

91
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:04,074
Speaker 1: you know the map you collect in the game Yeah, and I could see that there was obviously like some eyeballers You know on a map or something.

92
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:18,066
Speaker 1: it was something like that you like try bombing and like you try all four entrances There's nothing was a corner or an eyeball or some part of a map that clearly had a secret room And I couldn't get into it and with bombing from every direction right.

93
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:21,410
Speaker 1: so I Tried to walk through and sure enough it worked.

94
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,133
Speaker 1: Just the same way.

95
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,303
Speaker 1: the top right of the map worked, and then I said well.

96
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:28,368
Speaker 1: I guess I have to walk into every Suspicious wall in every dungeon now.

97
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:34,250
Speaker 0: So uh in the news there is basically one gigantic news.

98
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:42,769
Speaker 1: Thank you news gods for bringing the biggest most giantest amazing news on a Tuesday So I don't gotta do any work.

99
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:58,270
Speaker 1: so Activision Blizzard, which is already a ridiculous amalgam of Activision and Blizzard which yeah It shouldn't really exist in its current form as is But it does and it's been in the shit for a while.

100
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:01,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they're like the reasons that we have discussed.

101
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:06,916
Speaker 0: yep, but to give a really high-level summary Blizzard like Activision I like as an entity.

102
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:11,706
Speaker 0: before it acquired Blizzard I Rarely liked their game, so I'm not gonna dwell on that.

103
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,238
Speaker 1: but well I mean Activision went through a lot of stages.

104
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,045
Speaker 0: are we going to go back to a pitfall?

105
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:19,236
Speaker 0: pitfall to a Triumph of game design?

106
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:23,311
Speaker 1: right and then that you had that and then you had the Activision that made mech warrior 2.

107
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:24,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was that Activision.

108
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:32,630
Speaker 0: But no the Activision of recent times is not the kind of gaming that Scott and I are particularly fans of ourselves.

109
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:41,518
Speaker 0: So it was pretty much the Call of Duty company right yeah, or as my brain Just always thinks whenever I hear about Call of Duty.

110
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:46,577
Speaker 1: Oh that Counter-Strike knockoff I Don't think it's anything like Counter-Strike.

111
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:47,160
Speaker 0: It's not it's just.

112
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,970
Speaker 0: it's the kind of FPS that I don't enjoy.

113
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:50,762
Speaker 1: It's just a military FPS.

114
00:07:50,782 --> 00:07:51,608
Speaker 1: That's real popular.

115
00:07:51,648 --> 00:08:00,716
Speaker 0: Yep I I'm much more into either the like ridiculous quaky style FPS is or the like quote Hyper-realistic FPS is.

116
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:05,130
Speaker 0: but I'm making quote marks here because neither Counter-Strike nor PUBG are particularly realistic.

117
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:20,030
Speaker 0: It's just it's realism as game design and like a set aesthetic, but anyway Blizzard Have for a while Was doing very well in terms of having good game design and doing the right things in games.

118
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:25,626
Speaker 1: But I think much like valve Blizzard, you know from its onset with the Warcraft 1 right.

119
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:31,830
Speaker 1: you know Starcraft Yeah, it was a company that made PC games of high quality.

120
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,480
Speaker 1: You know they made them slowly and carefully.

121
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,807
Speaker 0: I trusted their game design.

122
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:43,409
Speaker 0: like the game designers They had would say very interesting good things and make very good designs, right?

123
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,110
Speaker 1: They weren't just cranking games out for money like other companies.

124
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:53,050
Speaker 1: You know historically they had like these really top tier PC and even crossover PC Mac titles.

125
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,260
Speaker 1: They didn't do a lot of console stuff.

126
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:03,579
Speaker 1: There were a few console ports that were just kind of meh You know but yeah But they were huge worldwide these mega hit games.

127
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:11,600
Speaker 1: Starcraft was the greatest biggest deal in RTS is ever you know You know World of Warcraft was the biggest MMO right?

128
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,887
Speaker 1: It's like they were just the champs of these.

129
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:21,170
Speaker 1: you know these games Yeah, basically they invented categories of games and other categories of games were invented as mods to gay.

130
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:28,730
Speaker 0: Hey, it's like yeah, you know look at Boba's started off as Warcraft 3 mods Because I play it a lot I think about it a lot, but look at what they did with overwatch.

131
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,743
Speaker 0: It basically said hey what Team Fortress 2 tried to be.

132
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:36,208
Speaker 0: here's what that looks like if you Seriously polish it and for real dive into it.

133
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, their games had a lot of polish.

134
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:41,400
Speaker 1: so but yeah They combined with Activision and things started to.

135
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,910
Speaker 1: you know go downhill right slowly.

136
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:52,550
Speaker 1: Sure, you know carefully right it didn't just jump off a cliff, but I think I bit like game designers I knew of who worked in Blizzard.

137
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,806
Speaker 0: We're just quitting like one by one very publicly and then like more behind the scenes.

138
00:09:57,147 --> 00:10:04,000
Speaker 0: there was a slow but steady increase in artists and Developers and other people quitting Blizzard.

139
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,586
Speaker 0: all that I think it was people quitting.

140
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,472
Speaker 1: there was the big layoffs They had.

141
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:09,218
Speaker 1: there were a lot of disorganize.

142
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:14,325
Speaker 1: you can see a lot of dysfunction right sort of like when you see a sports team Like doing really poorly.

143
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:19,906
Speaker 1: yeah It's usually because this organizational dysfunction, and you could tell they weren't delivering games.

144
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:24,593
Speaker 1: things are getting delayed Canceled right you know It's just.

145
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,813
Speaker 1: you know.

146
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,662
Speaker 1: they had like all kinds of messes in various categories.

147
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:30,330
Speaker 1: They made their you know their MOBA.

148
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:30,813
Speaker 1: What was it?

149
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,059
Speaker 1: What's that thing called?

150
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:32,864
Speaker 0: Oh god?

151
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:33,890
Speaker 0: Oh and here's of the storm?

152
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, right so that thing didn't do very well.

153
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,650
Speaker 1: You know it's basically before heroes of the storm.

154
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,561
Speaker 1: It's like did Blizzard ever have a stinker really now.

155
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:47,160
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that's like a complete stinker Yeah, but it's like every single game.

156
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:54,281
Speaker 0: They fucking ever put out was like S tier Even if it wasn't a game that we personally would play or like.

157
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:57,130
Speaker 0: you can appreciate the level of polish and design.

158
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:58,740
Speaker 1: Right it's like I wasn't.

159
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,511
Speaker 1: I'm not great at RTS's I never.

160
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,298
Speaker 1: I didn't play World of Warcraft.

161
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,230
Speaker 1: I respect what Starcraft did, but it's like right.

162
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:10,267
Speaker 1: But it's like every game They put out was S tier and like in Heroes of the Storm was not an S tier game right.

163
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:16,474
Speaker 0: so It's like they stay were going downhill and that independent of that There was all the.

164
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:21,210
Speaker 0: we've talked about this at length as has most of the industry because they are a triple-a game studio.

165
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:28,420
Speaker 0: There is endemic widespread sexism sexual assault HR Shenanigans all sorts of crap.

166
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:38,913
Speaker 1: I'm sure I have no evidence But I feel pretty confident and would not be surprised if similar things were exposed about other large game companies Which they have been.

167
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:47,190
Speaker 0: Riot was the one getting most of the attention for that until the Blizzard Stories overshadowed it in public conversation for a hot minute.

168
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:53,590
Speaker 1: Well, I think the evidence of the Blizzard ones and the tawdryness were oh, you know, well the Blizzard ones.

169
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:02,598
Speaker 0: I think what they surprised everyone is that it it turned out that all the worst offenders in Blizzard were not Activision people who came in as part of the acquisition.

170
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:04,564
Speaker 0: It was original Blizzard people.

171
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:05,486
Speaker 0: Yeah.

172
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:17,488
Speaker 1: Well, you know old PC gaming which from a triple-a game industry like that's just that you assume that's happening At any major studio, but I got to assume that's happening, you know Ubisoft.

173
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:22,343
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I mean Ubisoft had significant recent scandals of similar scale.

174
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:23,867
Speaker 1: So right, but right.

175
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:30,450
Speaker 0: but Blizzard got hit I think the hardest partly because Blizzard wouldn't fire Kotick like that's like a weird sticking point.

176
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:31,253
Speaker 1: They are.

177
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:35,770
Speaker 1: they have recently just in the past few, you know weeks months whatever they fight.

178
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,830
Speaker 1: I think it said they fired 30 some odd people and then like reprimanded many more people.

179
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:46,358
Speaker 0: There's already rumblings that Microsoft is Diving into that as part of the site, right?

180
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:50,030
Speaker 1: Well, I think this was it was this was probably like leading up to that, right?

181
00:12:50,311 --> 00:13:03,170
Speaker 1: so, you know they were Basically going through their huge pile of unaddressed HR issues and addressing them to you know, too late But better late than never but also too little too late whichever one you want to choose but time.

182
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:16,499
Speaker 1: So it's been obvious that a company that was so has so valuable and had such valuable IPs And was such a big deal That had hit a hard times.

183
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,084
Speaker 1: Yeah was gonna get acquired.

184
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,170
Speaker 0: that seemed well, especially because look what happened.

185
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:30,690
Speaker 0: They lost so many of their best-known designers and the people who are Responsible for making these games this polished that they turned into effectively.

186
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:39,960
Speaker 0: They weren't a husk yet, but the trajectory was to potentially become a husk that owns a lot of extremely popular IP But couldn't execute on that IP.

187
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, they stopped being able to execute.

188
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:47,737
Speaker 1: You know, I think after the the accurate the Activision combo I think really hurt their ex.

189
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:53,581
Speaker 0: Oh even little stuff like when the changes happen in overwatch You could see because I play that game a lot.

190
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:54,103
Speaker 0: I'm very.

191
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:55,930
Speaker 1: I mean I saw what was going on with Hearthstone.

192
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:20,330
Speaker 0: But overwatch you started to see that there used to be like when a patch came out The game balance was altered in like very interesting ways and like there was a lot of care Numerous patches started coming out that made minor updates to characters that radically rebalance the game in Unanticipated and annoying ways like over just recently like that little bit of polish fell away.

193
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:25,605
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's a whole we could talk about, you know Troubles of maintaining a lifestyle game.

194
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:30,090
Speaker 0: that could be a Tuesday I could be a not only an episode but that's a panel lifestyle.

195
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,818
Speaker 0: Well, but not that.

196
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,350
Speaker 1: but the thing is, you know We've never had to be never been in the spot of doing it.

197
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,630
Speaker 0: So we only can talk about no, but I've been in the spot of being someone who plays a lifestyle game.

198
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:45,282
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too several times Anyway, so what else is going on by Microsoft?

199
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,209
Speaker 0: So what what's notable about this one?

200
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,570
Speaker 0: Antitrust needs to be tearing the games industry apart, but we could say that about literally every industry.

201
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,650
Speaker 1: So right this is this should be under normal antitrust circumstances not allowed.

202
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:04,130
Speaker 1: But Activision blisters shouldn't have been allowed in the first place, but much worse things have been allowed recently.

203
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you know it's worse.

204
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,236
Speaker 0: you know nerds defend this stuff.

205
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,724
Speaker 0: nerds love to talk about how they love that.

206
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:20,418
Speaker 0: Disney owns all the IP because they got all the Crossovers they want and they're getting what they wanted, but that is obviously a disaster For literally everyone.

207
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:29,230
Speaker 1: but the fanboy who's excited about the MCU, it's just not it's not good You know, we're talking only now about the it, you know, the artistic industries the creative industries.

208
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:39,449
Speaker 1: It's bad for you know culture and bad for art to have a few, you know Mega corpse right being the ones who decide, you know, what gets made.

209
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:46,190
Speaker 1: I go is what and I mean obviously other things get made but they're choosing what gets made with a high budget.

210
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,037
Speaker 0: Well, it's real simple.

211
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,610
Speaker 0: your release the Tuesday episode of geek nights.

212
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,422
Speaker 0: You're all familiar with shadowrun the mega corpse of the bad guys, right?

213
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:54,870
Speaker 0: Every mega Corp is bad without exception.

214
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,856
Speaker 0: There's no good ones.

215
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,129
Speaker 0: That is literally the reality of earth.

216
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:00,296
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

217
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,410
Speaker 0: The only possible exception is a cooperative government nationalization.

218
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:09,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you got a lip if you're in a cyberpunk place.

219
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,688
Speaker 1: He got his live in the weird no Corp area, right?

220
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,595
Speaker 1: Yep, you know st.

221
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:14,277
Speaker 1: Star Wars.

222
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:15,642
Speaker 1: Oh, we're on the cloud city.

223
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:17,790
Speaker 1: We were gonna avoid Imperial complications.

224
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:21,967
Speaker 0: Instead you just have Lando complications obviously.

225
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,409
Speaker 0: So what else is going on here?

226
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,641
Speaker 0: So Wall Street people were once again surprised by this.

227
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:28,962
Speaker 0: I am.

228
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:35,322
Speaker 0: it is amazing to me how Generally Wall Street people will always come to me like clockwork.

229
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,830
Speaker 0: Do you know how many people were messaging me today people?

230
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:43,105
Speaker 0: I haven't talked to in like five or more years like oh, what's going on with Activision?

231
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,990
Speaker 0: seventy billion dollars WTF?

232
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,033
Speaker 0: What don't I know?

233
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,364
Speaker 0: and it's just like did you ever listen to a word?

234
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,057
Speaker 1: I've said at any point It's like I didn't see it coming.

235
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,623
Speaker 1: But in retrospect I should have seen this.

236
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:55,410
Speaker 0: I didn't see it coming today.

237
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,983
Speaker 0: I literally I was what I woke up.

238
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:59,315
Speaker 0: cuz I you know I wake up at 5 a.m.

239
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:00,800
Speaker 0: To see if I can ski and I can't ski.

240
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,947
Speaker 0: and then Emily's like happy birthday.

241
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:06,490
Speaker 0: also Blizzard just got bought by Microsoft.

242
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,682
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much those.

243
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:31,310
Speaker 0: because full disclosure I own a lot of Activision stock that I bought when I Toward the end of that giant dip when I thought that it looked like they were firing P bad people one by one And I felt like the company would have been strong enough to come through and turn this ship around and at least become like less bad than the median in the game industry.

244
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,120
Speaker 0: But instead they got bought and discussed.

245
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,106
Speaker 0: the stock skyrocketed.

246
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:40,462
Speaker 0: so full disclosure I own a bunch of Blizzard stock that just went up a lot because it's gonna turn into Microsoft.

247
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:40,944
Speaker 0: Basically.

248
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:47,522
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically, so Assuming assuming this passes, you know, this still has to pass the regular.

249
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:51,916
Speaker 0: there is zero chance in my personal Non-professional opinion.

250
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:55,287
Speaker 0: I just blocked or even looked at I think 1% chance.

251
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,899
Speaker 1: It gets looked at and the only reason it

252
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:21,110
Speaker 0: could possibly get looked at would be that Progressives in America have historically gone after the video game industry for the wrong reasons and it's an easy target for them, especially older Democrats, but to a bunch of people might give this a second look only because People who don't pay attention to games are shocked by the big numbers that come out of games.

253
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:28,130
Speaker 0: Do you how many people literally did not believe me when I told them how much as modé sold for and who bought them and why?

254
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:30,234
Speaker 0: They literally.

255
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:34,049
Speaker 0: the response from professionals on Wall Street was what do you mean billion?

256
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:37,573
Speaker 1: I Don't I don't for Just.

257
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:41,263
Speaker 1: I don't think it's looked at because of the game part.

258
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,309
Speaker 1: I think it gets looked at because the Microsoft part.

259
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:47,930
Speaker 0: Ah, no, because this is a drop in the bucket for Microsoft even with the big number.

260
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,617
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what is this right now?

261
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:54,284
Speaker 1: Let's talk about why are the nerds excited when there's a mega?

262
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:54,625
Speaker 1: well

263
00:18:54,685 --> 00:19:15,469
Speaker 0: Microsoft in this case Has been honestly a much better corporate citizen than other similar mega curves not saying they should exist but they have been a better corporate citizen partly because They constantly get attacked with antitrust stuff from non US sources to the point that they are always playing defense there.

264
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:22,430
Speaker 1: Well, not just antitrust, but let's talk about what you know, the things that are actually gonna matter to you know, a gamer, right?

265
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,150
Speaker 1: So what's gonna happen long term here?

266
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:41,390
Speaker 1: Well first I think I've even seen news that already confirms that the games are gonna come to game pass Right, so you can buy the Xbox game pass and get all the fucking Activision Blizzard games and or whatever ones they put in Right, but also I could what I could see happening that again.

267
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:47,310
Speaker 1: This is you know, we just said why do nerds, you know love the mega corp when the mega corp is the bad guy, right?

268
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:59,810
Speaker 1: You know what Microsoft is probably gonna do all that shit that Blizzard refused to do all those years right give us You know, they're like, oh, we don't want to just make Warcraft for Microsoft's gonna be like what the fuck's wrong with you.

269
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,619
Speaker 1: Just make fucking Warcraft for right.

270
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,745
Speaker 1: It's gonna make us a fortune.

271
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:03,429
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

272
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,301
Speaker 1: Right World of Warcraft to do it Starcraft 3 just do it.

273
00:20:07,602 --> 00:20:09,910
Speaker 1: Don't be doing making this new garbage, right?

274
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,337
Speaker 1: Just go all in on the obvious winners.

275
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:16,190
Speaker 1: We bought you cuz we want money right and the nerds are gonna love it.

276
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:17,407
Speaker 1: It's gonna work.

277
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:24,270
Speaker 1: So I think and you know the get rid of stupid battle net they'll incorporate it with all the Xbox shit instead.

278
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,548
Speaker 1: You know, you'll you'll use Microsoft store to buy those games or something, you know.

279
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:30,456
Speaker 1: That's how it's gonna be.

280
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:31,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get all the games.

281
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,970
Speaker 1: look the work on the Xbox properly, right?

282
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,258
Speaker 1: But yeah, think of it Microsoft owns fucking minecraft.

283
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,289
Speaker 1: You're gonna get Wow minecraft shit going on, right?

284
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, Microsoft owns old scrolls.

285
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,483
Speaker 1: You don't think you're gonna get an old scroll

286
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,166
Speaker 0: also

287
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,109
Speaker 1: with a Wow theme common

288
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:57,562
Speaker 0: absolutely not naming any names for a lot of reasons because these aren't like super big people but a few of the people I know who were at Blizzard went to Microsoft over the last couple of years.

289
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:05,206
Speaker 0: like I suspect Microsoft actually has a Material number of ex Blizzard developers and designers on staff.

290
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:06,611
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean that's all.

291
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:19,629
Speaker 1: it's always a tough call with that one because it is a pattern that you see but I could be a Perceived company and then the better these company ends up buying their old company, right?

292
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,070
Speaker 1: Well, well, the point is let's say you have a big company and a pile of people leave, right?

293
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,350
Speaker 1: Well, those people are likely to go to other big companies in adjacent industries.

294
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:39,949
Speaker 1: so even if Google bought Blizzard or I don't know Facebook bottom or You know literally no matter who bought them you could say that same thing.

295
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,161
Speaker 1: you'd like Oh, I know Blizzard people who left and went to that.

296
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,509
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I guess the difference is.

297
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:52,490
Speaker 0: the Minor nuance to that is that these are people who are primarily game designers or game developers, not just general like engineering.

298
00:21:52,931 --> 00:22:00,510
Speaker 1: I'm sure game designers and game developers who left Blizzard in recent times have gone to a variety of companies that all could have been purchasers.

299
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:04,105
Speaker 1: Right, you know, it's it's a so it's a you have to like.

300
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:14,038
Speaker 1: actually, you know Get the records and see how many left because that is what I see that same pattern happening in small Businesses where there's no question about it, right?

301
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:17,710
Speaker 1: It's like people left that company in a very small industry.

302
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:25,378
Speaker 1: a lot of them went to that other company in the very small industry and then that Company acquired the company the people.

303
00:22:25,398 --> 00:22:34,949
Speaker 0: sometimes what happens is not quite corporate espionage But like say you run a company that does something and you get a few people who worked at a competitor to join you.

304
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:41,274
Speaker 0: You'll learn a lot about your competitor as a result and sometimes what you learn is Oh, they're not doing well.

305
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,140
Speaker 0: or yeah, guess what?

306
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,806
Speaker 0: My awesome project got canceled.

307
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:46,150
Speaker 0: I'd really like to do that project.

308
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:47,398
Speaker 0: I'd like to do it.

309
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,470
Speaker 1: It wasn't an intentional espionage.

310
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:54,124
Speaker 1: It's that your industry is so small that it's like, you know, it's like.

311
00:22:54,185 --> 00:23:01,730
Speaker 1: okay the game industry isn't small But if you're a big biz Blizzard employee making a lot of money, there's only so many companies that can pay you that much money.

312
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:02,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't go.

313
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:06,210
Speaker 1: unless you want to go and lose a bunch of money and work for a small place.

314
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:07,909
Speaker 1: You're you're gonna work.

315
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, you think I'm gonna go do fixed protocol work for a smaller company than where I work now, right?

316
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,196
Speaker 1: It's you know that in the tech industry.

317
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:16,618
Speaker 1: Does it?

318
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:17,641
Speaker 1: they call it fang?

319
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,370
Speaker 1: It's Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix, Google.

320
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like once you work for one of those, you know, you're probably gonna be working for one of those.

321
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:32,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of my co-workers who have left my current company ended up at Facebook and a subset of them are currently at Microsoft.

322
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:39,219
Speaker 1: I guess now it's called man But so I guess you could.

323
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,770
Speaker 1: if you add Microsoft it would be mamang.

324
00:23:42,452 --> 00:24:13,350
Speaker 0: But I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna see a little more Wall Street attention toward gaming as an industry because there have been a number of big acquisitions like this recently where the dollar sides are big enough to where I suspect there is significant unethical untapped monetization and gaming that a lot of investors are going to be rabid for and I feel like I don't think this happened with Microsoft, but I think they're gonna see Similar acquisitions by companies that are going to go headfirst into NFTs as hard as possible.

325
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:21,730
Speaker 0: I'm actually you know in terms of Actually take a much more healthy approach to this intellectual property, right?

326
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,605
Speaker 1: If you know we've seen you know, Blizzard has been a little bit, you know less with the microtransactions.

327
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:39,257
Speaker 1: then say, you know An Ubisoft right or an EA with it's basically Ubisoft I think is the worst company that you've all heard of in terms of making that kind of game You know and then you know.

328
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:51,561
Speaker 1: and then after the after the really bad EA and the you know The Ubisoft's then you've got like epic which is sort of in this middle area and it's like, you know It's a little eh, but you know fortnight doesn't have any pay to win.

329
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,207
Speaker 1: It's all cosmetic, right?

330
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,190
Speaker 1: It's you know.

331
00:24:55,192 --> 00:25:03,775
Speaker 0: You know, I'm gonna save it but I've been playing a lot of fortnight lately And if any of you want to play with me once again Scott refuses to play any FPS is I would play fortnight.

332
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:05,482
Speaker 1: I just don't want to install the epic store.

333
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,526
Speaker 1: if fortnight was on steam.

334
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:07,189
Speaker 1: I'd play it right now.

335
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:15,232
Speaker 1: So the but then you basically if you go up a level again Right.

336
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:28,408
Speaker 1: We're in the situation where like our only the only big companies I can think of that are making the triple-a games That are like still kosher is basically Microsoft and Nintendo.

337
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:33,690
Speaker 0: Yep, right Because Sony is a too complex to talk about as a single entity.

338
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:42,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sony and then you also got square over there there while Square Enix is going hard and NFTs, you know They're there, you know, they got other problems too.

339
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:46,580
Speaker 1: But yeah, so It's pretty much Nintendo and Microsoft is like that.

340
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:57,838
Speaker 1: Those are the the safe havens I guess of triple-a gaming right now, but if like any, you know, I think Nintendo is unassailable, but You know Microsoft isn't.

341
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,750
Speaker 1: Microsoft could easily go down the You know micro transaction pay-to-win NFT hole.

342
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:22,968
Speaker 0: I feel like Microsoft has a better play in the long run by continuing to make quality games and not over monetizing gaming but using that to grow the broader Microsoft ecosystem as a whole and Continue to cement windows as being literally the only operating system that did that exists.

343
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:33,010
Speaker 0: if you're a gamer All right, so I'm looking forward to World of Halo and You're not looking forward to overwatch actually getting attention again from game designers?

344
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:35,354
Speaker 1: If right, it's like.

345
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:36,739
Speaker 1: on the one hand, right?

346
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,050
Speaker 1: I talked about all these possibilities of like all the great things they could do.

347
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:42,898
Speaker 1: I expect also chop chop.

348
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:43,300
Speaker 1: right.

349
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,670
Speaker 1: when you buy someone you always you always chop chop.

350
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,290
Speaker 1: I'm not saying overwatch is getting the chop chop by saying something's getting the chop, right?

351
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:57,830
Speaker 0: So considering overwatch has the nearly ready to launch overwatch - that is going after a deeply untapped segment of that market?

352
00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:00,562
Speaker 0: I feel like that is the least likely thing to get.

353
00:27:00,582 --> 00:27:02,470
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm not saying that's gonna get chopped.

354
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,494
Speaker 0: I'm saying I'm not.

355
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,338
Speaker 0: this is not rim.

356
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,567
Speaker 0: Hopefully wishing that overwatch gets investment.

357
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:08,294
Speaker 0: This is Cynical rim.

358
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:12,850
Speaker 0: honestly believing that Microsoft sees overwatch specifically as a big part of their strategy.

359
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:23,936
Speaker 0: Maybe It's got a. it's got a weirdly credible in sports presence like it does that Significant challenges.

360
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:33,182
Speaker 0: it is it is far from the most significant part of the not the most significant it is But it is a key part as in in my me.

361
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,189
Speaker 1: It's might not even be top five, right?

362
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:37,797
Speaker 0: Five now.

363
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:43,421
Speaker 1: Warcraft Call of Duty Wow Starcraft Diablo are the top five right.

364
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,989
Speaker 1: overwatch is sixth at best.

365
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:51,449
Speaker 0: It depends on what you're going after because those all go after terms of the value of the IP and the.

366
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,608
Speaker 1: you know The size of the player base, right?

367
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,560
Speaker 1: How much money you'll make from a game in that series?

368
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:03,214
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is those all have an easy to project relatively steady Revenue stream.

369
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:04,378
Speaker 0: it's easy to grow.

370
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:05,321
Speaker 0: There's nothing new there.

371
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,921
Speaker 0: It's hard to take those properties and go after a new Demographic Diablo.

372
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:16,990
Speaker 1: could if you do Demographic with them because now you own so many IPS you can just cross them all over.

373
00:28:17,211 --> 00:28:18,134
Speaker 0: No, but here here's the thing.

374
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:35,050
Speaker 0: What overwatch was doing with overwatch - I talked about this briefly years ago on geek nights is specifically open up a demographic of the people who like FPS is For literally the opposite of the reasons you and I like them and that is a way bigger market than competitive FPS.

375
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,344
Speaker 1: That's why for you know, it's you know, you know, it's a bit.

376
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:38,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

377
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,799
Speaker 1: You know makes that market look like nothing.

378
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,866
Speaker 1: World of Minecraft.

379
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:45,650
Speaker 1: Yeah But World of Minecraft is not World of Minecraft with halo skins.

380
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,730
Speaker 0: Okay, that makes more money over but it doesn't get that demographic that demographic right now.

381
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:58,270
Speaker 1: Basically, if you have world if you make World of Minecraft with halo skins, do you really need overwatch right?

382
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:14,170
Speaker 0: now because one thing Microsoft historically has done which is similar to what Blizzard has done is Even if there are two or three areas that have the most revenue They will keep business units alive and invest in them if they are profitable.

383
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:20,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, Microsoft has definitely not, you know been the biggest chopper, but something's gonna go.

384
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,664
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not So I will see the storm.

385
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:24,617
Speaker 1: Yeah It.

386
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:32,123
Speaker 0: So I had one brief little news before we get to the main bit.

387
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:34,573
Speaker 1: just because it's it is is so big you need Nothing news.

388
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:37,246
Speaker 0: It's just really funny because we brought up NFTs.

389
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:41,394
Speaker 0: So Shonen jump Announced today.

390
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:42,599

393
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:52,870
Speaker 1: Hey, it's not even a press release.

394
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:55,020
Speaker 1: It's a release that is gonna be a release.

395
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:56,869
Speaker 0: There is a press release that goes with it.

396
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:03,618
Speaker 0: I have personally in my life issued press releases for real Where the sole announcement was.

397
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,450
Speaker 0: there will be a future press release about X topic.

398
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:09,217
Speaker 0: Okay, I have done that myself.

399
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,048
Speaker 1: I guess marketing people just need you know to justify their jobs.

400
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:17,650
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I was the marketing person in that company at the time as well as everything else.

401
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:20,077
Speaker 0: So a pretty simple announcement right.

402
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,223
Speaker 0: do nothing to even like like.

403
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:28,529
Speaker 0: if you're trying to if you're trying to grab on to this tweet To like criticize or do anything you'd feel like it's just a slippery wall.

404
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:31,421
Speaker 0: Yet Dateline right now.

405
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:43,002
Speaker 0: There are 175 replies and 173 of them are People all saying this better not be fucking NFTs.

406
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:43,986
Speaker 0: I will start pirating.

407
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,290
Speaker 0: Shonen jumps so fast.

408
00:30:46,197 --> 00:30:47,689
Speaker 1: They tweeted that it's not NFTs.

409
00:30:47,894 --> 00:30:59,363
Speaker 0: Yes I Say this because we've been talking about this a lot on other nights of geek nights where NFTs are just this toxic cancer That is invading every space and they are making inroads into gaming.

410
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:16,629
Speaker 0: I just want to point out that sharp immediate and widespread anger in social media It doesn't necessarily stop companies from doing it But it forces them to take a stand and it forces them to reveal if you have any power over that over them or not.

411
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,616
Speaker 0: Kickstarter basically said you have no power over us.

412
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:21,783
Speaker 0: Fuck you discord said whoa, whoa, whoa.

413
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:22,304
Speaker 0: back that up.

414
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:22,766
Speaker 0: back that up.

415
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:23,468
Speaker 0: We're so sorry.

416
00:31:23,488 --> 00:31:29,826
Speaker 0: So Sharp immediate angry pressure has an impact do it every time.

417
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:32,453
Speaker 0: when it comes to NFTs yeah, it's.

418
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:40,341
Speaker 1: it's actually surprising to see, you know, I have not seen a lot of Positive responses on any NFT announcements.

419
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:43,483
Speaker 1: their majority are like get the shit out of you But to the fact.

420
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:48,683
Speaker 0: yet They got a big on a native NFT reaction when they didn't even say NFTs.

421
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:52,619
Speaker 0: it forced them to go further and say oh shit It's not NFTs.

422
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:53,203
Speaker 0: We're sorry.

423
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:58,403
Speaker 1: You thought that Right, but you know, it's companies are still trying it and they're.

424
00:31:58,504 --> 00:32:00,189
Speaker 1: you know, there was just some Castlevania NFTs.

425
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,570
Speaker 1: They made I guess a few hundred K off of it, right?

426
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,034
Speaker 1: But it's like.

427
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,333
Speaker 1: that seems like a lot of money But there's a lot of money.

428
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:10,790
Speaker 0: the news I was gonna use that I'm gonna say for the next Tuesday show is about a bunch Of.

429
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:21,269
Speaker 0: they've a bunch of reporters followed several gaming NFTs to see like who owns them where they ended up What happened to them and it's really enlightening and really funny and really sad.

430
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,395
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the.

431
00:32:31,281 --> 00:32:33,167
Speaker 0: So check this out real simple.

432
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:40,799
Speaker 0: There's a big discourse on Twitter for about 20 minutes a couple days ago Where someone pointed out that?

433
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,152
Speaker 0: When Sesame Street in particular got more commercialized.

434
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,100
Speaker 0: because you know, it's not just PBS anymore, you know the whole HBO thing.

435
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:56,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, the show has actually continued to be like very progressive and like good like it's still doing its Sesame Street job to a big Like.

436
00:32:56,863 --> 00:32:58,973
Speaker 0: a lot of the fears that's good didn't come to pass.

437
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,059
Speaker 0: still a fantastic show in fact.

438
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:25,754
Speaker 0: it's gotten more aggressive on social justice causes and so and on social media, but One thing that has largely disappeared from Sesame Street are the long Atmospheric aspects of it that were a big part of the early show Like the segments that didn't really do anything in particular That honestly were a big part of what I liked about Sesame Street as a little kid.

439
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:40,207
Speaker 0: so because of that conversation I thought back and I remembered there are exactly three Sesame Street skits that stood out in my like childhood as being formative to me that are just Constantly referenced by my brain to this day.

440
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:44,400
Speaker 0: One of them is one two, three, four, five six seven eight nine ten eleven.

441
00:33:46,503 --> 00:34:00,440
Speaker 0: Another one is the count of course like but anyway But the one that was the most burned into my brain If I had to describe it, it's the one where a kid plays a trumpet and then a motorcycle leaves.

442
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,571
Speaker 0: And I just found it on YouTube.

443
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,120
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to it as my thing of the day.

444
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:18,425
Speaker 0: I think this Sesame Street segment more so than anything else I ever saw in that show in my entire childhood Shaped my brain in some way because I think about it all the time To this day.

445
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:26,416
Speaker 0: and when this discourse came up my brain immediately said Oh like the trumpet one with the motorcycle and I googled for it.

446
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:27,079
Speaker 0: I found it.

447
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:36,399
Speaker 0: Apparently it was titled household sounds - Yeah So what you got?

448
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:41,079
Speaker 1: Oh So apparently I found this video and it shows some kind of business in Japan.

449
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,609
Speaker 1: I guess it looks like a garage of some sort And there was a big snow and this.

450
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:51,719
Speaker 1: so there's like a few feet of snow on the roof of the Garage right and has a big metal slanted roof.

451
00:34:52,302 --> 00:35:00,589
Speaker 1: so the dude is like poking the roof for the long stick like banging on it and Eventually all the snow just slumps off.

452
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:07,580
Speaker 1: this whole roof comes on all at once which is what you'd expect to happen But it's really fun and satisfying to see it happen.

453
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:12,220
Speaker 0: So I love this video play and the next video was a very similar video on the same channel.

454
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:16,465
Speaker 1: I was about to mention that so I Remember when I had a car.

455
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:16,926
Speaker 1: the worst.

456
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,500
Speaker 1: one of the worst things about having a car is having to scrape it when it snows.

457
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:22,218
Speaker 1: I'm glad I never have to do that again.

458
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:29,260
Speaker 1: But there was that one tiny bit of it where it was satisfying to have a sheet of ice just come off the windshield, right?

459
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:43,482
Speaker 1: So here you can get all the satisfying parts of someone else knocking snow off a roof without having to go out in the cold or do any hard work, so I Realized thanks to YouTube recommendations that rim also noticed.

460
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:54,214
Speaker 1: There's apparently a trend of this Genre of video of the roof has too much snow on it and it comes off all at once in a big satisfying clump.

461
00:35:54,274 --> 00:36:02,530
Speaker 0: there is a genre like that and a trend of literally any action and For some reason most of these videos are from Japan.

462
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:05,545
Speaker 1: So I think it must have something to do with the roofs there.

463
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:09,590
Speaker 0: so Scott Here's how we make enough money to do geek nights full-time.

464
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:12,299
Speaker 0: We make a vtuber some cute anime girl.

465
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:20,926
Speaker 0: Emily rigs it up for us and all we do is Watch videos and make videos of this with a cute anime girl.

466
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:23,533
Speaker 0: love vtuber Reacting to them.

467
00:36:24,377 --> 00:36:32,515
Speaker 1: you can have a hard time finding enough roofs with that or this kind of roof that's slanted and can you can bang on it and There's enough snow.

468
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:33,197
Speaker 0: so you know we do.

469
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,422
Speaker 0: we hire climate.

470
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,807
Speaker 0: we hire four people.

471
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:36,550
Speaker 0: pay him up.

472
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,142
Speaker 0: Hey, I'm something like pay him enough.

473
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:43,304
Speaker 0: go around Filming these kinds of things causing these situations, and it's not.

474
00:36:43,324 --> 00:36:44,750
Speaker 1: you can't use the same roof twice.

475
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,977
Speaker 1: You got to keep finding a new room.

476
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:52,059
Speaker 0: We also if we have to we start cheating we start Setting up these situations.

477
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:53,930
Speaker 0: change the colors use some Photoshop.

478
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:55,959
Speaker 1: Does that doesn't seem profitable?

479
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:58,290
Speaker 1: with how much it cost to run a snow machine to make that much?

480
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:02,714
Speaker 1: And it has to be the right kind of snow Also artificial.

481
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:04,945
Speaker 0: you only upload a video once we come off the roof.

482
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:05,166
Speaker 1: No.

483
00:37:05,186 --> 00:37:05,990
Speaker 0: It's a real good video.

484
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:09,786
Speaker 0: I like how the snow doesn't actually fall to the very very end of the video.

485
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:12,379
Speaker 1: - yes Yeah, if you want to just get to the egg.

486
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,110
Speaker 0: no no no no you need that foreplay.

487
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,935
Speaker 0: You've got to watch them cuz they're.

488
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:20,950
Speaker 0: I love the guys doing it cuz they're very clearly like they know how it's gonna go down.

489
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:26,530
Speaker 0: They're obviously a little excited about it, but they're also really afraid they're gonna mess it up, and it's gonna fall on them.

490
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:31,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's also you know while there are many videos in this genre.

491
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:32,190
Speaker 1: This is the best one.

492
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,317
Speaker 0: I thought this one's great whites.

493
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,530
Speaker 0: I saw one from a ski resort.

494
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:38,319
Speaker 0: I'll try to find it later and post it in the forum.

495
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:40,329
Speaker 0: It is way more than this.

496
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,029
Speaker 0: Like I think it would have killed people if it actually fell on them.

497
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,337
Speaker 1: I mean this would have probably seriously.

498
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:49,690
Speaker 0: I think you I think you would have easily broken it gotten a fracture from this hitting you.

499
00:37:51,451 --> 00:38:02,150
Speaker 0: Quite possibly yes, so in the meta moment the geeks not a book club book Which Scott is done with and I am steam rolling through to the end We're doing a show on this first week of February or second week whenever that Thursday falls at least one.

500
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:02,756
Speaker 1: You know what I got.

501
00:38:02,776 --> 00:38:04,169
Speaker 1: it possibly know what I gotta say.

502
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:07,990
Speaker 1: No, I gotta say I started reading the next book club.

503
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:09,454
Speaker 1: Oh, I read.

504
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:14,250
Speaker 1: I read two chapters in one sitting out this like lightning speed.

505
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:19,754
Speaker 1: It was like you know how they talk about like how in baseball when you swing the heavy bag Doesn't really make it.

506
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,099
Speaker 1: it doesn't actually help you.

507
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,861
Speaker 1: right.

508
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:34,170
Speaker 1: this might not actually help me read faster but after swinging the heavy Genji bat Reading a modern book from modern times of this century in English that was originally written in English.

509
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:45,421
Speaker 1: It's like it feels like the bat is like a feather like I feel like I'm reading Faster that I've ever read in my entire life and the Kindle says oh, you'll finish the whole book in eight hours And I'm like holy shit.

510
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:52,730
Speaker 1: That's like tomorrow This book is gonna be done in two seconds like it took me two years to read one book and like a week to read.

511
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,208
Speaker 1: So I'm looking forward to reading many books now.

512
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:00,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a pile of nonfiction books piled up even at this point.

513
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,730
Speaker 1: finish up that Genji so we can milk a few episodes.

514
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:05,899
Speaker 0: I think we can get two episodes out of it easily.

515
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:06,441
Speaker 0: We have to.

516
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:08,630
Speaker 1: we have to do a Thursday episode this week.

517
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:09,530
Speaker 1: Can you finish it tomorrow?

518
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,015
Speaker 1: I Guess the bats still too heavy.

519
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:17,906
Speaker 0: yeah, I'll definitely whatever the first Thursday is in February.

520
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:19,430
Speaker 0: I'll do 100% be ready for that.

521
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,219
Speaker 0: So otherwise no cons for a while.

522
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,665
Speaker 0: PAX East has been announced.

523
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:28,797
Speaker 0: looks like they just opened panel submissions.

524
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:33,687
Speaker 0: very likely If I go to PAX East at all I'm just gonna go into a panel or two and then leave.

525
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,097
Speaker 0: so Same deal is unplugged.

526
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,405
Speaker 1: I think yeah, you know I'm not gonna just make any decision about PAX East until very close to the.

527
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:43,790
Speaker 1: you know the time.

528
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,989
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we know for a fact it's gonna require masks.

529
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,224
Speaker 0: I can see no universe or that changes and I just don't feel like.

530
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:58,784
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't really see myself You know, I gotta get to Boston and I gotta get a hotel and I you know, it's like yeah I would probably just know what the deadline is for enforcer or panel.

531
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:02,435
Speaker 0: about veteran roll call was a while ago I mean, but I could still get.

532
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:03,118
Speaker 0: oh, yeah.

533
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:06,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think any veteran could trivially enforce these.

534
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:09,370
Speaker 1: yeah They're gonna be so desperate to get anyone to be like, yes, please come on.

535
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:21,789
Speaker 0: But I imagine because the most fun I have at PAX East like I love like PAX is a great But it's playing board games with my friends and it's also like the long leisurely like dinner before we all go in force at LTK.

536
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:32,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think yeah and without all my it's like even if I'm willing to go to the convention or whatever I put up with the hassle and if not enough of my people do the same thing.

537
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:34,730
Speaker 1: Then it's like what am I doing there, right?

538
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,990
Speaker 1: It'd be like when me and rim used to go to anime Boston with no one else I was like, but at least in anime Boston there was no COVID.

539
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,693
Speaker 0: So what did we do?

540
00:40:40,753 --> 00:40:44,990
Speaker 0: we could go hang out in Boston like go to a restaurant and like hang out there long enough to?

541
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,546
Speaker 0: eat dessert.

542
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:58,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did, you know, but you know nowadays Yeah, it'd be really weird if we had just the two of us went to a convention with no one else for a whole weekend Plus and we didn't have enough stuff to do with the convention.

543
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,630
Speaker 0: I got a taste of it weren't staff at the convention?

544
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:08,644
Speaker 0: the other thing I that is just a. this is a logistical problem that I thought about but I Experienced it when I went to pecs unplugged for a few hours.

545
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:23,464
Speaker 0: I did like walk around tabletop talk to people in there and what I noticed is that in an expo hall like space it is Extremely difficult to understand what people are saying through their masks because of the background.

546
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:29,310
Speaker 1: roar Yeah, could be and I imagine maybe you should go check that you maybe should go to the ear doctor though.

547
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:36,130
Speaker 0: Also, just now cuz no one can understand me there's like I'd like half my conversations were what what what until we got out of tabletop.

548
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:38,254
Speaker 1: I mean, that's it.

549
00:41:38,335 --> 00:41:43,760
Speaker 1: That's a problem with tabletop conventions in general, especially for oh, yeah Even without masks like pre COVID times.

550
00:41:44,162 --> 00:41:45,970
Speaker 0: It is hard to understand people in that hall.

551
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:52,690
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is I think that's why historically the RPG cons have been you know, mostly the smaller.

552
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:56,170
Speaker 1: Right, it's very few big ones because it becomes very hard.

553
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,890
Speaker 0: Incon was already reaching the upper limit and even then we had to cram like four games into a room and it was too much.

554
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:02,579
Speaker 0: It was too loud.

555
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:13,010
Speaker 1: Yep maybe we could make some sort of system though where Everyone's got a phone and everyone's got noise cancelling headphones and you put them on but you have a group chat.

556
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,704
Speaker 1: Just but you know you I guess you could just open up discord on your phone.

557
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:16,709
Speaker 0: You just do that with crisp.

558
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:21,830
Speaker 0: I feel like you want to make an app that like makes it just work and you sell the app for a dollar.

559
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:24,557
Speaker 1: We should just try it with discord.

560
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:24,978
Speaker 1: one time.

561
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:34,870
Speaker 1: just everyone put on a noise cancelling headphone in the same room With I guess the discord open but you have to use the microphone that's in your headphones that you don't pick up everyone else's.

562
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,550
Speaker 0: None of my headphones have microphones.

563
00:42:37,752 --> 00:42:40,004
Speaker 1: Mind anyway, you get the idea there.

564
00:42:40,165 --> 00:42:41,110
Speaker 1: There could be something there.

565
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,306
Speaker 1: I think the hardest part is if you talk and someone else's microphone picks up your voice.

566
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:51,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the biggest danger We should test cuz they're all sitting around a table all wearing mics and headsets.

567
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:52,527
Speaker 1: now you want to hear.

568
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:53,957
Speaker 0: you want to go not so mode.

569
00:42:54,806 --> 00:43:01,339
Speaker 0: I could It would so theoretically I could bring this audio device which I can power with from like.

570
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,975
Speaker 0: I don't need to plug it in necessarily and I can rig us up.

571
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:06,317
Speaker 0: I'd have.

572
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:06,980
Speaker 0: I bought some more.

573
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,647
Speaker 0: I am so we could have a local device.

574
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:09,430
Speaker 0: that did it perfectly.

575
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,030
Speaker 1: You got to make sure all the mics are super direction.

576
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,249
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the thing is it would be it would take me about a half hour to set up meaning we just sit around.

577
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:19,742
Speaker 1: That's not tenable.

578
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:20,430
Speaker 1: No, that's not ten.

579
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,942
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing we would sit at a table for like all day at effects.

580
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:41,862
Speaker 1: All right, so this game came out called Inscription with a Y in the middle and it looked like it was sort of a slay the spire Kind of game right where it's a little bit of roguelike situation, right where you explore a map And along the way you build your deck at various spots.

581
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:48,243
Speaker 1: you stop on the map and then you have Encounters with enemies and you have to battle them using the deck that you've built.

582
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:55,442
Speaker 1: you add cards to it along the way you remove Cards you upgrade cards modify cards, right and it was getting some really good reviews.

583
00:43:55,984 --> 00:44:05,240
Speaker 1: and also the aesthetic of it from the screenshots I saw was sort of It's not five nights at Freddy's but it's sort of.

584
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:05,822
Speaker 0: it feels like.

585
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:08,850
Speaker 0: it feels like every horror VR game that's out right now.

586
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:10,876
Speaker 1: It's sort of it's.

587
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:14,210
Speaker 1: it's creepy, but not scary creepy, but weird.

588
00:44:14,411 --> 00:44:16,819
Speaker 1: Oh, you know kind of it is.

589
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:18,143
Speaker 0: it is very unnerving.

590
00:44:18,163 --> 00:44:20,210
Speaker 0: You're basically like first FPS style.

591
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,804
Speaker 1: So it's it's in that same territory as like cards the cowardly dog, right?

592
00:44:23,845 --> 00:44:25,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're basically FPS.

593
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:30,619
Speaker 0: I'll be in the woods locked in a cabin with Some what appears to be a person.

594
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:36,797
Speaker 0: you can really only see their eyes or masks they put on and they are Vaguely threatening the entire time.

595
00:44:36,837 --> 00:44:37,881
Speaker 0: they like they're there.

596
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:38,765
Speaker 0: There is always.

597
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:43,924
Speaker 0: you feel like They're gonna stab you if you anger them like.

598
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,289
Speaker 0: that's the feeling you have.

599
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:47,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're.

600
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:49,450
Speaker 1: they have it yet and they're kind of just losing you.

601
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,005
Speaker 0: They're kind of a weird that guy monster like entity and they're.

602
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:56,629
Speaker 0: they're basically Getting you to play this board game with them.

603
00:44:57,131 --> 00:45:02,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you feel like you've been kidnapped by a potential serial killer, but they haven't killed you.

604
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:09,541
Speaker 1: They let you roam around the room freely They don't let you leave though And all they want you to do is play this card game with them.

605
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:12,690
Speaker 1: and the consequences for losing aren't really dire.

606
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:13,922
Speaker 1: You just have to try again.

607
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:21,150
Speaker 1: Yeah So you have no choice And you can run around and explore the room and mess up stuff.

608
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,412
Speaker 0: There's another room nearby where there's something going on in there and you can't open it Yet.

609
00:45:26,513 --> 00:45:27,584
Speaker 0: Yep.

610
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:28,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

611
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,702
Speaker 1: So basically what the element that this adds to slay the spire?

612
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:34,270
Speaker 1: that slay the spire doesn't have is a plot.

613
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,197
Speaker 1: There's a story going on here.

614
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:39,408
Speaker 1: And also if you're it's an escape room actually.

615
00:45:39,428 --> 00:45:46,549
Speaker 1: Yeah This you know this very mist style classic escape room puzzle things going on in the room.

616
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:52,025
Speaker 1: now You know items you can't grab, you know vaults you can't open, you know a clock.

617
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:53,570
Speaker 1: you can turn the hands on the clock.

618
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,961
Speaker 1: You don't got to figure out it's a it's a puzzle.

619
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,628
Speaker 1: What time do you set the clock to unlock?

620
00:45:57,668 --> 00:45:58,070
Speaker 1: a secret?

621
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:58,792
Speaker 1: I don't know.

622
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:04,330
Speaker 0: Oh god do a thing to see the answer to that puzzle something kind of gross and disturbing.

623
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:06,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

624
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:20,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess what I would say is it's a game where Using an item might do like it'll do the game effect that the game tells you it'll do but the fiction of what happened It might be extremely shocking to you.

625
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, not spoiling anything.

626
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,504
Speaker 0: is the game so short?

627
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:24,449
Speaker 0: like you should just play it.

628
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:27,905
Speaker 0: This game is fantastic, by the way, but I'm noticing something else.

629
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:28,829
Speaker 0: I'm on the steam page.

630
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:37,790
Speaker 0: Everything we've described is Literally all that is revealed about the game in any official channel.

631
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:43,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game does not the I guess minor spoiler.

632
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:44,928
Speaker 1: right the game has three acts.

633
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:45,530
Speaker 1: Yep, right?

634
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:58,510
Speaker 1: Everything we've told you about the game is all in act one After act one, it's basically like, you know It opens up and the game doesn't teach you anything about itself.

635
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:05,903
Speaker 1: But the one thing it does do is when you first load the game It's got a main menu like games normally have.

636
00:47:05,943 --> 00:47:07,510
Speaker 0: yeah, I noticed that right away.

637
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:13,510
Speaker 0: And for the first thing I thought was when you is oh Did I launch this on my laptop and make a save file and forget?

638
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:19,150
Speaker 1: Right, your first instinct is to click new game, but you can't click new game.

639
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:19,953
Speaker 1: It won't let you.

640
00:47:20,114 --> 00:47:26,824
Speaker 1: all you can do as soon as you have a fresh install of the game is Continue you're loading a save file.

641
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:32,429
Speaker 1: when you start this game It's your only option besides the options menu or quitting, right?

642
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:42,449
Speaker 1: so and that's yes, that's what you're supposed to do is you start by continuing the save game and then You sort of make sense later.

643
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,436
Speaker 1: What's going on, right?

644
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:55,052
Speaker 1: So yeah much is revealed Over the course of the game that is shocking and surprising and clever and meta Yeah interesting

645
00:47:55,112 --> 00:48:16,458
Speaker 0: clever met is something that stands out the most like this game evokes the feeling of Being a kid and playing a game You didn't know how to present read the rule book and you're kind of just trying to figure it out as you go like Kind of like that game we played on the 3ds where it was Like hey play these fake retro games and read the strategy guide Like when you're in the room with the dude.

646
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:23,959
Speaker 0: the rule book to the game is there you can just read it But there's like ink spilled on some of the pages Mm-hmm.

647
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:41,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there is a Lot of commentary in this game social commentary specifically about you know CCG gaming Yeah You know and on various other similar, you know gaming world related topics.

648
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:44,225
Speaker 1: So it's meta in that sense.

649
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:47,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just and whoever wrote this.

650
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:53,510
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, there's some you know, minor polished things to criticize here and there.

651
00:48:54,351 --> 00:49:00,210
Speaker 1: Unlike slay the spire the card game itself doesn't really have a long replay value.

652
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:06,895
Speaker 0: I mean it has more in the later act when There's a lot more going on then.

653
00:49:06,935 --> 00:49:08,900
Speaker 0: but it's more about that construction that about.

654
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, the board the board is trivial.

655
00:49:11,207 --> 00:49:16,830
Speaker 1: I Made a really cheesy deck really quickly and then just dominated with it.

656
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:23,542
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah until except for certain enemies that have a twist, you know Like slay the spire has the time boy right where it's like aha.

657
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:24,466
Speaker 1: You made a shiv deck.

658
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:27,021
Speaker 1: Well, yeah Good luck with that.

659
00:49:27,082 --> 00:49:27,810
Speaker 1: Oh you made a power.

660
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,604
Speaker 0: I know it's random, but it always feels like slay the spire.

661
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:31,710
Speaker 0: in the third act.

662
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,558
Speaker 0: It's like oh you made the deck.

663
00:49:33,578 --> 00:49:35,165
Speaker 0: that's good against the two boys.

664
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:36,250
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the time Lord.

665
00:49:36,411 --> 00:49:37,978
Speaker 0: Oh you took care of the time Lord.

666
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,490
Speaker 0: It's the two boys in an inscription.

667
00:49:40,671 --> 00:49:47,507
Speaker 1: I made a deck that summons the big character right away the big monsters right away And then there was a playing a green dead.

668
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:52,670
Speaker 1: basically There was an enemy that that did not work against at all Had to make a different day.

669
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:57,931
Speaker 0: I guess Like to sell you on this game a little bit like part of the conceit in the first part of the game that we talked About.

670
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:12,905
Speaker 0: the most is like you're playing the game, but then you draw a card and the animal on the card Talks to you and he's basically like yo, you gotta help us And like you find another card and then the guy who's running the game is mad.

671
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:14,130
Speaker 0: like where'd that card come from?

672
00:50:14,571 --> 00:50:19,796
Speaker 0: well, I guess it's in the game so we got a roll with it, but I don't like that.

673
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,809
Speaker 0: You have that card and stuff like that.

674
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:23,354
Speaker 1: The game.

675
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:28,469
Speaker 1: it's really, you know, the way they bring the meta and the story together is really out there.

676
00:50:29,153 --> 00:50:31,410
Speaker 1: But - but it's totally it's totally comprehensive.

677
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,319
Speaker 1: It's like you can understand what the hell is going on, but - important.

678
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:40,721
Speaker 0: if the game had ended when I beat that part I would have been perfectly happy with the game.

679
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:44,112
Speaker 0: Like I would have been like, oh, yeah, I would 20 bucks.

680
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:45,677
Speaker 0: it was worth one alone.

681
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:49,349
Speaker 1: and then I got act two and three and I was like, oh bonus content.

682
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:54,330
Speaker 1: great This is you know, so we're not gonna was actually somewhat disappointed that there was an act two and three.

683
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,029
Speaker 1: I was like, oh I want a shorter game so I can move on with my life when I hit you.

684
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:03,329
Speaker 0: good I have to continue when I hit the menu or you get to see six things.

685
00:51:03,952 --> 00:51:05,880
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, is this the clever ending?

686
00:51:06,242 --> 00:51:08,210
Speaker 0: Is this the framing story cool?

687
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:18,330
Speaker 0: And then when I got into the ass the real second night of the game, I was like Guess this game's longer than I thought like looking at my watch like really like games to be short these days.

688
00:51:19,171 --> 00:51:21,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, but it pulled me in pretty hard.

689
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:22,109
Speaker 0: So it's fine.

690
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:23,515
Speaker 0: But so it.

691
00:51:23,977 --> 00:51:26,808
Speaker 1: one good thing I can say which I've discovered it since.

692
00:51:26,848 --> 00:51:27,269
Speaker 1: I beat it.

693
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:29,463
Speaker 1: I don't know if rim beat it, but I'm real near the end.

694
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,489
Speaker 0: I didn't beat it beat it yet.

695
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:34,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is only one ending for this game.

696
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:37,802
Speaker 1: There is no Choose your own adventure aspect.

697
00:51:37,842 --> 00:51:39,310
Speaker 1: There's no chrono trigger, right?

698
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:45,930
Speaker 1: Just don't worry if there are choices in the game that feel like oh no if I make a choice here, that's wrong.

699
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,097
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to play the game over to get a different ending.

700
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,883
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.

701
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:55,041
Speaker 1: Just press onwards and Everything will be revealed no matter what decisions you made.

702
00:51:55,122 --> 00:52:00,763
Speaker 1: as long as you keep winning at the card game Right and keep going forward and then the game will end.

703
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:03,354
Speaker 1: you'll know when it really ended It'll be obvious.

704
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:07,370
Speaker 1: and the only things you might miss is there are a couple.

705
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:09,627
Speaker 1: I don't want to say easter egg, but like.

706
00:52:10,677 --> 00:52:11,910
Speaker 1: It's like an escape room, right?

707
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:16,029
Speaker 1: So imagine you're in an escape room and let's say there's like a vault in the escape room.

708
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:20,736
Speaker 1: Sometimes you might need to open the vault to escape But what if you didn't?

709
00:52:20,856 --> 00:52:23,830
Speaker 1: what if the vault just had like bonus things in it, right?

710
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:31,255
Speaker 1: There are a few things like that where it's like if you didn't completely solve everything You might have missed a little.

711
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:35,646
Speaker 1: you know goodie here or there, but you won't stop you from beating the game.

712
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:47,610
Speaker 1: and also There was an ARG for the game But the solution to the ARG led to a YouTube video that is like less than a minute long.

713
00:52:48,052 --> 00:52:51,909
Speaker 1: You can easily with a Google search find a link to that YouTube video.

714
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:54,390
Speaker 1: Avoid playing the ARG or whatever.

715
00:52:54,751 --> 00:53:00,429
Speaker 1: It's probably too late to even do it now and just watch those 50 seconds as an epilogue after you beat the game.

716
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,381
Speaker 1: It's not really that big a deal if you don't though.

717
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:05,690
Speaker 1: It's like not that much happens in 50 seconds, right?

718
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:09,906
Speaker 0: So so I guess if you haven't played this game like honestly this game is 100% worth playing.

719
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,837
Speaker 0: I've never really played anything quite like it.

720
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:16,450
Speaker 0: I enjoyed the hell out of it, and I highly encourage you to buy it.

721
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:18,770
Speaker 0: I also highly encourage you to stop listening now.

722
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:24,625
Speaker 0: We're not gonna like mega spoil everything, but I want to talk with Scott least a little bit about Some of the things that happen.

723
00:53:26,214 --> 00:53:27,097
Speaker 1: Did you beat it or not?

724
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:27,900
Speaker 0: I didn't beat it beat it.

725
00:53:28,462 --> 00:53:28,622
Speaker 1: Okay.

726
00:53:28,662 --> 00:53:29,766
Speaker 1: You didn't beat it beat it.

727
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,580
Speaker 0: All right, but Honestly, just go play this game.

728
00:53:32,621 --> 00:53:34,911
Speaker 0: It's great, and I guess I Was.

729
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:39,525
Speaker 1: if it's on sale definitely go absolutely even at the full price.

730
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:50,449
Speaker 1: It's a game that you can buy Play all the way through be done with Remember it leave an impression on you as a really good work of art And then you don't have to go back to it unless you really want to.

731
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:53,516
Speaker 1: But if you did go back to it It'd be very easy to do so.

732
00:53:53,737 --> 00:54:08,176
Speaker 0: so because the way the game was made like rendered in the beginning I Was very surprised that there wasn't a VR Option because that could have been really easy to make and imagine how it would have added some immersion and some imagine how Absolutely cool.

733
00:54:08,236 --> 00:54:10,629
Speaker 0: It would be to play like that part of the game in VR.

734
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:12,037
Speaker 1: But well did you get?

735
00:54:12,077 --> 00:54:13,344
Speaker 1: did you get to act three now?

736
00:54:13,565 --> 00:54:14,249
Speaker 0: I'm still an act two.

737
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,557
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna get into act three.

738
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,695
Speaker 1: well act three might have some good VR awesome, but act two Would not work in VR.

739
00:54:23,317 --> 00:54:25,444
Speaker 1: act two would know you would act two.

740
00:54:25,485 --> 00:54:26,568
Speaker 1: VR is useless for act two.

741
00:54:26,608 --> 00:54:28,475
Speaker 1: yep But you could.

742
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:39,690
Speaker 1: you could make a different game because remember right so spoilers right it's like You're a human playing a game, but your character in the game is a human who's sitting at a computer playing.

743
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:40,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like.

744
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:46,090
Speaker 0: I was reminded by that when I heard his voice in act two when something happens.

745
00:54:46,813 --> 00:55:00,455
Speaker 1: So you're a got you're a human in the real world sitting at a computer playing a game And in the game you're a human playing a sitting at a computer and then in the game the card game There's like yet another character.

746
00:55:00,575 --> 00:55:01,518
Speaker 1: That's like the avid right.

747
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:05,229
Speaker 1: so you could make a VR experience.

748
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:08,078
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You are like that guy.

749
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:09,644
Speaker 1: so like you're always adequate.

750
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:10,487
Speaker 1: you just you know.

751
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,210
Speaker 0: so here's the problem.

752
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:19,930
Speaker 0: This is this is like that for that would only work with a high-end VR kit because a big problem in VR Is that without extreme resolution?

753
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:25,240
Speaker 0: Anything that's like looking at screens or text inside of a game can be real dicey.

754
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:28,235
Speaker 0: But like I could do a thing.

755
00:55:28,275 --> 00:55:34,301
Speaker 1: you could do a thing where when you sit down at like in VR You go to the chair next to the computer.

756
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,958
Speaker 1: now when you sit at the chair It just take the.

757
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:38,269
Speaker 1: it takes up your whole visor.

758
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,207
Speaker 1: But you could do it with a high VR, and then you can get up whenever you want.

759
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:44,408
Speaker 0: so yeah Yeah, you never played super hot in VR.

760
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:57,210
Speaker 0: But the way it works is you put you sit down you stand there you put on the VR helmet Then it shows you in a realistic real-world apartment And there's a VR rig in there and then in the game you put on that VR set to play super hot.

761
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:04,401
Speaker 1: I could definitely you could also make a sequel inscription to where The game is a VR game.

762
00:56:04,722 --> 00:56:06,108
Speaker 1: right and you do that same thing.

763
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:07,655
Speaker 0: yep Ah that would be.

764
00:56:07,736 --> 00:56:10,750
Speaker 1: you could because basically you can make the game in the game.

765
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,930
Speaker 0: You could play with that to such a ridiculous degree.

766
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:18,689
Speaker 0: That's very adjacent to an idea chase, and I have been workshopping back and forth for years that we're never gonna do.

767
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:22,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've been calling it the room for a while.

768
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:24,994
Speaker 1: I mean you could.

769
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:28,665
Speaker 1: I mean you know taking the old half-life elevator.

770
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:33,738
Speaker 0: They you know mod and just Right it's basically that but with the twist, but anyway.

771
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:37,647
Speaker 1: so uh else about inscription you want to say no other than like.

772
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:57,222
Speaker 0: I was deeply impressed with this game in the how it Made a game within a game Just fun and engaging and difficult enough for me to play with But not difficult enough to where I had to seriously like Read that entire rule book in the game to figure out how to win.

773
00:56:57,262 --> 00:56:59,927
Speaker 0: like you could kind of play it fast and loose and still get through.

774
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:06,317
Speaker 0: The escape room aspects were very true to escape rooms Which was good and bad in that.

775
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,930
Speaker 0: yep, I solved every escape room puzzle with brute force.

776
00:57:11,392 --> 00:57:12,016
Speaker 1: Now some of them.

777
00:57:12,337 --> 00:57:17,730
Speaker 0: I even though I just like all the combination locks I just brute force because there were only three things.

778
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:20,080
Speaker 0: So it was so quick for some of them.

779
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,370
Speaker 1: cuz I had already cuz I found the codes or whatever.

780
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:23,313
Speaker 0: I one point.

781
00:57:23,394 --> 00:57:27,510
Speaker 0: I saw what I thought was the code, but I and I put it in and it wasn't it.

782
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:29,709
Speaker 0: I think it was a code for a different part.

783
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:33,741
Speaker 0: So I just said fuck it, and I just clicked randomly and after like 30 seconds.

784
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:34,383
Speaker 0: It just opened.

785
00:57:35,105 --> 00:57:43,710
Speaker 1: there was one really obtuse one That I googled out of impatience But actually the answer to it appeared in like the next segment of the game.

786
00:57:43,951 --> 00:57:44,593
Speaker 1: I just waited.

787
00:57:44,955 --> 00:57:45,476
Speaker 1: I would have had it.

788
00:57:45,878 --> 00:57:46,540
Speaker 0: you know what that is.

789
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:48,227
Speaker 0: that's like Crystal Chronicles when you are.

790
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:48,468
Speaker 1: it was.

791
00:57:48,628 --> 00:57:50,357
Speaker 1: it was one of The unnecessary ones.

792
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:52,670
Speaker 0: never in Crystal Chronicles we encountered a puzzle.

793
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:54,195
Speaker 0: We thought it was solvable.

794
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:59,252
Speaker 0: you googled it to figure it out and determined that it was not actually Solvable.

795
00:57:59,412 --> 00:58:04,653
Speaker 0: at the point of the game we were at we just had encountered it early and were weird nerds who were obsessed with solving Something.

796
00:58:04,673 --> 00:58:06,268
Speaker 1: that was a good game design lesson.

797
00:58:07,111 --> 00:58:10,923
Speaker 0: You know if you don't reveal a puzzle that you can't solve without all that.

798
00:58:10,963 --> 00:58:13,250
Speaker 1: so so for example Super Metroid.

799
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:17,524
Speaker 1: Right I got to show the player the super missile door before you give them the super missile.

800
00:58:17,544 --> 00:58:19,250
Speaker 0: otherwise the super missiles not that exciting.

801
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:28,109
Speaker 1: Right, but you also have to make it absolutely clear to the player Unambiguously that there is no point in shooting this green door.

802
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:29,837
Speaker 1: Just carry on.

803
00:58:30,098 --> 00:58:31,905
Speaker 0: that is why Metroid Dread was very clear.

804
00:58:31,985 --> 00:58:37,310
Speaker 0: do not use Being able to survive and attack by one of those things as a strategy.

805
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:46,375
Speaker 1: We do not intend you to play this game this way, so if you're an escape room Don't put puzzles before You know answers.

806
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:46,616
Speaker 1: right.

807
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:52,192
Speaker 0: if the escape rooms love that because the red herring is a big part of why escape rooms are even remotely Challenging.

808
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:53,577
Speaker 0: that's part of like the red.

809
00:58:53,858 --> 00:58:55,143
Speaker 1: make the red herring.

810
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:59,318
Speaker 1: red herring clues Not red herring doors.

811
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:00,924
Speaker 1: red herring keys are good.

812
00:59:00,964 --> 00:59:07,864
Speaker 1: red herring doors exactly Right not the greatest unless you do them really well, right so that it's clear.

813
00:59:07,884 --> 00:59:14,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't do this yet But I guess that's sort of the secret sauce of this game that I appreciated.

814
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:19,430
Speaker 0: Is that every puzzle or when you get to the stack - we have to make a deck like yeah?

815
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:27,908
Speaker 0: There's a there's more skill there But it's not so hard that you have to think about it for more than a few minutes to figure out a cheesy enough deck That'll get you to the next part of the game.

816
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:28,934
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's.

817
00:59:29,014 --> 00:59:31,666
Speaker 1: it's actually a good thing that the card game isn't so good.

818
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:31,967
Speaker 1: right?

819
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:36,843
Speaker 1: because you think about Slay the spire where the card game you can just yeah, it was just magic.

820
00:59:36,903 --> 00:59:38,829
Speaker 0: like this game would have been way too much.

821
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:50,510
Speaker 1: Well, but imagine if you had a card game where they get but the game The card game was good and infinite really playable, but the game itself is this one-shot experience.

822
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:51,675
Speaker 1: Well, it's like well.

823
00:59:51,695 --> 00:59:54,790
Speaker 1: I've beat the game and now there's this great card game.

824
00:59:54,912 --> 01:00:01,370
Speaker 1: I want to explore more But I have no avenue in which to explore that card game because the game itself is over.

825
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:07,430
Speaker 1: So you don't want to put a good infinitely replayable deep card game in a one-shot experience.

826
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,000
Speaker 1: Exactly because it'll be and likewise.

827
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,469
Speaker 1: Let's say you had a crappy card game like this.

828
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:16,413
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not crappy, but you know a card game That's not that deep.

829
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:22,390
Speaker 0: it is less deep than like original magic with no expansions like there is not much going on.

830
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:25,602
Speaker 1: It's a shallower game with a lot more luck involved.

831
01:00:25,702 --> 01:00:27,830
Speaker 0: right not very well cuz really it's not a game.

832
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:28,856
Speaker 0: It's a series of puzzles.

833
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:31,230
Speaker 0: the way the game actually works, but I digress exactly.

834
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:36,566
Speaker 1: But let's say you put that game on the infinitely replayable roguelike slay the spire.

835
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:37,970
Speaker 1: You would get bored.

836
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:40,124
Speaker 1: You'd be like why would I climb the spire again?

837
01:00:40,164 --> 01:00:40,929
Speaker 1: This card game is.

838
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,177
Speaker 1: no I'm already I've spent I've exhausted the.

839
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:44,561
Speaker 0: why do I keep climbing the spire?

840
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:51,748
Speaker 0: one because the ascensions are so hard Yeah, and two because that game has surprising depth.

841
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:54,576
Speaker 1: Yep, see an inscription.

842
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:55,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, also.

843
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,545
Speaker 0: I watch this video the AGDQ and good lord.

844
01:00:57,605 --> 01:00:58,989
Speaker 0: I did not know about the room doubling.

845
01:00:59,009 --> 01:01:03,333
Speaker 1: glitch And Play it through.

846
01:01:03,614 --> 01:01:05,542
Speaker 1: beat it once then you'll be done with it.

847
01:01:05,702 --> 01:01:07,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, no more content after you beat it.

848
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:08,553
Speaker 1: So don't worry about it.

849
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:13,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, anytime you feel like you miss something just steamroll ahead.

850
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:22,686
Speaker 0: It'll be fine like you don't just go forward You do not need to fully understand the cards And you are not going to fully understand why those three animals are talking to you in the first act.

851
01:01:22,706 --> 01:01:23,489
Speaker 0: just roll with it.

852
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:32,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, just pay attention to everything, but just all you got to do is just try to progress forward right And you'll.

853
01:01:32,075 --> 01:01:43,219
Speaker 1: eventually you'll beat it trust me and it'll be worth the time it takes you to be up and I guess money that you paid for content warning if physical body horror bothers you be ready for.

854
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,807
Speaker 0: there are two things in this game that do die.

855
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:48,096
Speaker 0: very very Visceral body horror.

856
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,864
Speaker 1: act one is the most horror.

857
01:01:49,945 --> 01:01:51,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a in act one.

858
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:57,410
Speaker 0: There's an item the pliers and you can use them to basically put weight on the scale like cheat at the game.

859
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:05,479
Speaker 0: But the way if you actually click on this item what it does is your character rips one of their teeth out Like like right there doesn't warn you.

860
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,154
Speaker 0: just happens and you put this bloody tooth on the scale The knife.

861
01:02:09,516 --> 01:02:12,448
Speaker 0: you gouge out one of your own eyes in first person.

862
01:02:13,632 --> 01:02:15,697
Speaker 0: Yep, so be ready for that.

863
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,502
Speaker 0: the game in no way warns you.

864
01:02:17,963 --> 01:02:22,876
Speaker 0: but those are the only two things I encountered that were like like that VR eye gouging.

865
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,099
Speaker 0: I mean I played some indie experiences where they had an eye focused jump-scare.

866
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:34,098
Speaker 0: I would argue that that is Unethical game design when a VR is good enough.

867
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:35,882
Speaker 0: You could really without consent.

868
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:36,343
Speaker 1: Yeah.

869
01:02:36,504 --> 01:02:37,948
Speaker 0: Yeah without forewarning.

870
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:46,170
Speaker 0: I fully forewarned Slammed into the wall when that happened in a VR indie game that I played like literally bodied the wall.
