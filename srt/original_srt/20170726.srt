1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,426
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, July 26th, 2017.

2
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,151
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:13,355
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:18,606
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight Castlevania On Netflix.

5
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:19,552
Speaker 0: The not anime.

6
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:20,719
Speaker 1: The Netflix one.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,937
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,793
Speaker 1: So my whole life, I don't like wearing shoes.

9
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:37,053
Speaker 1: Like that's just a thing I really would rather does not have shoes on but at the same time I don't want the bottoms of my feet to be covered in poop, shall we say.

10
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:39,140
Speaker 0: I just don't like wearing uncomfortable or painful shoes.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,479
Speaker 0: So I always wear the most comfortable shoe.

12
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,629
Speaker 0: I don't wear an uncomfortable shoe ever.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,825
Speaker 1: But the most comfortable kind of foot covering is Probably the sandal.

14
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,311
Speaker 1: The high quality sandal.

15
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:51,400
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of wearing the sandal.

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,252
Speaker 0: The most comfortable shoe covering is a sneaker that is extremely squishy and light.

17
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:59,260
Speaker 1: But that is not optimal if it's hot outside.

18
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,333
Speaker 0: I don't really have a problem of overheating feet.

19
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:03,680
Speaker 1: It's so much more comfortable.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
Speaker 1: Like if I'm wearing sandals, I could even get away with wearing pants instead of shorts.

21
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:10,070
Speaker 1: That's how profound a difference that is.

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,973
Speaker 0: I don't have this problem.

23
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,600
Speaker 1: Also, the sandal is just chill.

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,507
Speaker 1: It's airy, your feet are hanging out there.

25
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:16,234
Speaker 1: They get tanned like the rest of you.

26
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,378
Speaker 0: I don't have this problem.

27
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,824
Speaker 1: Anyway, I really like sandals.

28
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:22,040
Speaker 1: I'm really particular about my sandals because I don't like flip-flops.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,723
Speaker 1: I think they're...

30
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:26,958
Speaker 0: No, I hate any any sandal where the thing goes between your big toe and your next toe.

31
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,010
Speaker 1: But that's because it literally is like a glove on your foot.

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,552
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

33
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,740
Speaker 0: A toe shoe is fine at least in that regard.

34
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:33,840
Speaker 1: It's a glove on your foot.

35
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:46,793
Speaker 0: If you are using this Spoke that goes between your big toe and your second toe as a means of keeping the shoe on the foot It means you sort of have to squeeze those toes together a little bit.

36
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:49,905
Speaker 1: You have to walk with a weird game Which I read articles there.

37
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:54,800
Speaker 1: there is evidence that walking long distances and flip-flops causes specific harm, right?

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,261
Speaker 0: There is it.

39
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,990
Speaker 0: well to you, you know, a podiatrist wouldn't recommend it, right?

40
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is not comfortable.

41
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,961
Speaker 0: It is Painful.

42
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:08,720
Speaker 0: A flip-flop is pretty much only an emergency device to cross a short distance on a hot sand and then remove them.

43
00:02:09,143 --> 00:02:17,140
Speaker 0: Or to like go out to a garbage chute Sure, like walk out into a hallway to go into a shower that might have a fungus in it.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,480
Speaker 0: Perhaps a shared locker room type environment shower because pool shoes are kind of garbagey.

45
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,810
Speaker 1: I used to use pool shoes and those are not great.

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,099
Speaker 0: I don't know if they make those anymore.

47
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:36,013
Speaker 1: If there is a place in the world for Crocs to exist it might be that shower situation Yes, but no other situation.

48
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:36,920
Speaker 1: No other situation.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:50,697
Speaker 1: but anyway My issue is that I want if I wear sandals I want my foot to be basically completely exposed But it has to have the three straps two in the front and one around the heel.

50
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,820
Speaker 1: It doesn't go around the heel.

51
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:54,573
Speaker 1: It's worthless because you still have to walk weird to keep them on your foot.

52
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,980
Speaker 0: See I don't have this problem.

53
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,888
Speaker 0: I have the sandal with just two straps.

54
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:00,057
Speaker 0: I don't like it, but it is right.

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,552
Speaker 0: Essential there are many sandals that do not have the third strap.

56
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,800
Speaker 0: that will like fall off your foot, right?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, the point is no matter what the mechanism I know I don't care about a specific mechanism or whatever But it has to be a saddle that is securely remains on your foot on its own So that you do not have to adjust your walking or your foot position.

58
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,765
Speaker 0: You can just walk the same way.

59
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,814
Speaker 0: you walk in a tied shoe.

60
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:30,500
Speaker 0: Yep, right and This is why I like the three straps and my two strap just stays on just fine.

61
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:34,180
Speaker 1: I can walk normally in it But so the difference is I can walk in the two straps just fine.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,820
Speaker 1: But if I run or something comes up if there's a chance it'll pop off.

63
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,732
Speaker 1: I guess try to run it in your sandal.

64
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:41,737
Speaker 0: There's a possibility.

65
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,047
Speaker 1: with the straps You can just run.

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,643
Speaker 1: But anyway, I bought some Birkenstocks because they seem to be like the only brand that hipster brand three straps Sandals anymore.

67
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,228
Speaker 0: You can buy them from funny a brand.

68
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:54,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, so no on Zappos.

69
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:57,000
Speaker 1: They're there were almost no three strap sandals.

70
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,786
Speaker 0: Anyway, like not I'm sure them.

71
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,035
Speaker 1: so five years ago in April.

72
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:05,775
Speaker 1: So a little more than five years ago I bought some Birkenstock sandals with the three straps hipsters.

73
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:12,380
Speaker 1: only today Five plus years later have they worn out enough to where they are no longer wearable.

74
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,313
Speaker 0: Aren't they supposed to last like a lifetime or whatever?

75
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,199
Speaker 0: They have some kind of warranty.

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,269
Speaker 0: Isn't that why the hipsters are all into them like?

77
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:22,728
Speaker 0: I don't know they were just they were break them in over the course of Years like like why?

78
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,596
Speaker 1: no, they broke in basically immediately.

79
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:25,320
Speaker 1: They were fine.

80
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,636
Speaker 0: It's that get last forever your whole life.

81
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,240
Speaker 0: You wear this way.

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,345
Speaker 1: I never encountered any that.

83
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:30,671
Speaker 1: but I basically I buy.

84
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:38,117
Speaker 1: they could be blues brother on me like every part of them failed at once and I look cuz I could have gotten before.

85
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,240
Speaker 0: I like Because you wanted to buy a new sandal.

86
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,788
Speaker 1: No, actually I don't like new sandals because I like the like.

87
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:48,132
Speaker 1: collected grease of my foot over five years makes it like like it Perfectly is formed to my feet.

88
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but They blues brother.

89
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:55,460
Speaker 1: They completely fell apart and I looked it would cost me from even like one of those crap.

90
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,869
Speaker 1: Oh cobblers in like a subway station 40 or 50 bucks to resold them.

91
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,640
Speaker 0: Aren't you supposed to take into the actual Birkenstock company?

92
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,043
Speaker 1: I don't know.

93
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:05,027
Speaker 0: you have like award.

94
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,272
Speaker 0: There's like a thing they do there.

95
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,120
Speaker 0: It is like that's their mystique or whatever.

96
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:08,723
Speaker 1: I've never.

97
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,833
Speaker 1: I didn't even think I I didn't encounter that.

98
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:12,160
Speaker 1: I just I had these sandals.

99
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:15,939
Speaker 1: I wore them out because I used the hell out of this and googling five plus years.

100
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:20,564
Speaker 1: so cobblers like 40 50 bucks to Resole them.

101
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:27,539
Speaker 1: but I can just buy brand new ones for only a little bit more than that and thus get around all the issues The fact that I've beaten the heck out of out of the years.

102
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:31,579
Speaker 1: So I think I'm gonna buy new sandals every five years for the rest of my life.

103
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,638
Speaker 1: Maybe when I'm old it'll be ten years because I won't walk around as much.

104
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:34,960
Speaker 1: We'll see.

105
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:39,420
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's Wednesday, it's comic day, it's not sandal day.

106
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:41,814
Speaker 1: We already did an episode on shoes a long time ago.

107
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:42,880
Speaker 1: So what's your news?

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,652
Speaker 0: there was tons and tons of huge news from the San Diego comic.

109
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:52,733
Speaker 1: like Matt Groening is doing a new show and Ready player one like people are flipping out about how bad that thing is.

110
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,560
Speaker 0: I mean, it was so weird, right?

111
00:05:54,881 --> 00:06:00,020
Speaker 0: I it felt like when ready player one was a new hot thing that we were the only ones going.

112
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,109
Speaker 0: But now everyone's going in.

113
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,535
Speaker 1: Well, I think what happened?

114
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:04,499
Speaker 0: everyone learned from us.

115
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,286
Speaker 0: Is it where they were the?

116
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,440
Speaker 1: someone else described this in detail in a Twitter conversation?

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,760
Speaker 1: But to summarize because I think they're dead on it most it became really popular because it was in that loot crate or whatever.

118
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,820
Speaker 0: Is that really the reason it became popular?

119
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,771
Speaker 1: This I haven't been able to verify.

120
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:30,324
Speaker 0: really evidence of this I have Back, we're like living in Beacon even and like some, you know listeners told us to read this and I heard it was one Of those things, you know You know how I do that.

121
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:36,371
Speaker 0: when I see something getting lots and lots of buzz and people can't shut up Then I go and check it out like Madoka Magica.

122
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,240
Speaker 1: That's why we check that out exactly people.

123
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:49,079
Speaker 1: I read the whole goddamn book way back that I Think I mean I quit in the middle of Dragon's Gold Serpent silver chimeras copper and yet you finish this.

124
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:51,789
Speaker 0: I mean, it was very easy and quick to read.

125
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:00,068
Speaker 0: it took me like a couple days, but Scott it diminishes the soul Not really At least now no one can tell me all you haven't read it.

126
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:00,309
Speaker 0: I could.

127
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:03,340
Speaker 0: now I can I can freely swing Scott stick of judgment.

128
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,171
Speaker 0: And anyone who says did you even read this?

129
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:19,097
Speaker 1: I'll say yeah read the whole fucking thing Piece of garbage, but basically what they said was that When it suddenly got really popular The only people who were talking about it were the kinds of people that it was aimed like.

130
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:24,631
Speaker 1: the demographic It was perfectly suited for Were the people who were doing all the reviews and all the talking.

131
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:32,075
Speaker 0: the impression that I had back when I read it in those Days when is getting buzz was that everyone in the world seemed to be in freaking love with this thing except me.

132
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,645
Speaker 1: and then now Regular people tried to read.

133
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:38,192
Speaker 0: look at Twitter now, and it's pretty much.

134
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:39,897
Speaker 0: I have seen just only negative.

135
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,344
Speaker 0: I've not seen a single Positive comment.

136
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:51,698
Speaker 0: the only positive comment is I was I was talking to a nerd that I am Only slightly acquainted with in person, and I was like yeah, that sucks.

137
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:52,280
Speaker 0: They were like why?

138
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:58,879
Speaker 0: And then that same person also.

139
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:04,384
Speaker 0: I think they subscribe to loot crate and also That's two strikes.

140
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,140
Speaker 0: and also we went to the Lego store, and I ogled like that Apollo rocket and didn't buy it.

141
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,680
Speaker 0: They actually bought like three Lego things one of which is ninja go You know actually it's really good.

142
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:20,160
Speaker 1: I haven't been to the Lego store in a long time cuz I think I would just start buying Lego.

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,367
Speaker 0: The only I was at the Lego store.

144
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:27,751
Speaker 0: the only thing you want at the Lego store is the Saturn 5.

145
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,824
Speaker 0: It's only $120.

146
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:31,770
Speaker 0: the problem is it will not fit in your apartment.

147
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,100
Speaker 0: you need to find someone else to keep it for you.

148
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:43,525
Speaker 0: But it functions perfectly like the little Lander pops off turns around and docks the other way All the stages.

149
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,954
Speaker 1: if I had a three-bedroom apartment there'd be a room.

150
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,508
Speaker 1: that was the rabbits and Lego room And that's all they'd be in there.

151
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,798
Speaker 0: a rabbit's Lego.

152
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:49,999
Speaker 0: safe.

153
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:55,460
Speaker 1: I think we're average actually have a hard time biting Legos cuz they're real, but they're real powerful.

154
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:56,972
Speaker 0: I'm not worried about hurting the rabbit.

155
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:57,234
Speaker 0: I'm worried.

156
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:57,758
Speaker 0: We're hurting Lego.

157
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:00,987
Speaker 1: The Lego would be up on tables.

158
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:09,253
Speaker 1: I think my train table it falls down and then I feel I mean rabbits are experts at biting things.

159
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,460
Speaker 1: I feel like they could bite them and come out unharmed.

160
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,126
Speaker 0: We'll see.

161
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:14,840
Speaker 0: you want to swallow them But basically yeah.

162
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,240
Speaker 1: But when I gathered there was this wave of people like all the early waves of people who were reading that book.

163
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:32,754
Speaker 1: We're like the kinds of people who would love that completely non introspective like regurgitative Pablum aimed at the most pandering of panders the people who go woo.

164
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:34,300
Speaker 0: when the woo game happens at a convention.

165
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:37,634
Speaker 0: I mean there's no who wait in line for swag in the packs dealers room.

166
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:38,538
Speaker 1: There's that screenshot.

167
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,429
Speaker 0: someone keeps waiting line for an anime con dealers room to open.

168
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,660
Speaker 1: this screenshot has hit my feed easily 40 times.

169
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:56,421
Speaker 1: Covers to comic books and it's just like one page for ready player one and it's just literally lists of proper nouns from Wikipedia from the 80s Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,934
Speaker 1: Also as people pointed out like none of that stuff was things that like women made.

171
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,300
Speaker 1: it was no like black music.

172
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,460
Speaker 1: It was just like white boy music like there.

173
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,882
Speaker 1: There's a lot.

174
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:16,668
Speaker 1: there's so many problems with ready player one and I think just recently because the movies being made People who aren't that Demographic looked at it and said what's going on in here?

175
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:17,570
Speaker 1: What's this?

176
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, the funniest thing is the people distributing that.

177
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:28,912
Speaker 0: that I guess tirade of About porn that the author wrote.

178
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:30,197
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't.

179
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:36,100
Speaker 0: I saw that You know, basically reminding you what kind of person the author of ready player one is.

180
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:38,299
Speaker 0: Which is disgusting.

181
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:44,275
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Yeah, anyway, here's some real news from San Diego comic-con.

182
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:47,265
Speaker 0: So back in the day There was vertigo comics.

183
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:52,920
Speaker 0: right vertigo comics is a was a an imprint which means it's really DC Comics.

184
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:54,860
Speaker 0: It's the same exact, you know company.

185
00:10:55,382 --> 00:11:00,400
Speaker 0: But they put a different label on it because this ain't Superman and ain't Batman, right?

186
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,299
Speaker 1: It's other stuff can't scare the Superman people away, right?

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,089
Speaker 0: So they just put a different label on it and it's managed by.

188
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:14,600
Speaker 0: it has different its own editor its own staff and stuff and They work separately right with their own label, but money wise their own the same part of the same company.

189
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:19,745
Speaker 0: so vertigo still exists, but The thing is back in the day.

190
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:26,233
Speaker 0: the editor of vertigo the person in charge was this woman and Karen burger burger burger I don't know if the G is hard or soft.

191
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:35,334
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter And she was responsible for publishing Many of the greatest American comics ever.

192
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:35,675
Speaker 0: right?

193
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:45,539
Speaker 0: we're talking V for Vendetta We're talking Sandman preacher fables fucking Why the last man?

194
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,123
Speaker 0: Like fucking everything.

195
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,408
Speaker 1: it's good stuff in here right?

196
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:51,460
Speaker 0: vertigo comics was like the greatest, right?

197
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,025
Speaker 0: It's like you.

198
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:57,879
Speaker 0: if vertigo came out with a new book Like I would just get issue number one just to see what it was because if they're publishing it's probably something good, right?

199
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:01,320
Speaker 0: So what happened is I don't there's some drama or whatever.

200
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:09,356
Speaker 0: she was kicked out and or left and she she disappeared and Since then vertigo has just been like publishing nothing like.

201
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,000
Speaker 0: they still exist.

202
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,879
Speaker 0: they still put books out, but a lot of them are just reprints and garbage that no one really cares about.

203
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,631
Speaker 0: and Like they're still in the catalog, but they're effectively.

204
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,196
Speaker 0: they may as well be dead right.

205
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,560
Speaker 0: it may as well not exist anymore.

206
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,405
Speaker 0: That's sad times right.

207
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:31,971
Speaker 0: but image comics since then has been publishing all the good shit like the sagas and the Descenders of the world right.

208
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:39,100
Speaker 0: things that may have been Vertigo in if they had been published 10 and 15 years ago are now all at image, right?

209
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,549
Speaker 0: But this gives us a problem because without vertigo There's not really a lot of competition for image.

210
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,205
Speaker 0: right you got Marvel in DC or doing underwear perverts only right Japan.

211
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:52,675
Speaker 0: those publishers are in a different country.

212
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:59,518
Speaker 0: that IDW which used to do good stuff is now sort of like only doing licensed stuff right.

213
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:08,220
Speaker 0: ponies Transformers yeah, I chose they just got Sonic the Hedgehog from Archie which and actually that stuff is generally actually pretty good.

214
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:09,972
Speaker 1: But it's not this kind of calm.

215
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:15,754
Speaker 0: that stuff raised IDW from being sort of an indie tiny publisher to being like big-time publish.

216
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:17,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, right actually I really want to read mask.

217
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,007
Speaker 1: Sure, I just haven't yet.

218
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,192
Speaker 1: I've been busy go for it.

219
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:22,418
Speaker 0: They'll probably trade soon.

220
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:30,611
Speaker 0: Yeah so all anything that's like a licensed nerd property that's not owned by Disney or Warner DC is over at IDW.

221
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:31,033
Speaker 0: right.

222
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,639
Speaker 0: all the Hasbro things all that stuff.

223
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,513
Speaker 0: So the only other really big American comics publisher.

224
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:43,975
Speaker 0: You know that's the super big right There's like some medium-sized ones like boom and stuff or your mouse guards and things like that.

225
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,480
Speaker 0: like you know what whatever.

226
00:13:46,083 --> 00:14:05,177
Speaker 0: But you know is Dark Horse and Dark Horse is mostly doing mangas Hellboys, I think they have like alien Buffy the Vampire Slayer Those sorts of things right and they just sort of quietly over there on the side You know doing their thing not getting a lot of attention, but now big dudes.

227
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:17,663
Speaker 0: Karen Berger Who ran vertigo back in the day has signed up with Dark Horse and they're gonna make Dark Horse burger books first of all Totally deservedly.

228
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:21,095
Speaker 0: She just gets her name on the fucking job right what that that means?

229
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,587
Speaker 1: seal of approval slash Endorsement, right?

230
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,600
Speaker 0: So this is actually not new news.

231
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:32,717
Speaker 0: We knew this is coming like some months ago But now at Comic Con they actually announced the like the initial books that are coming out.

232
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:37,996
Speaker 0: So they got Hungry Ghosts by Anthony Bourdain the cover alone.

233
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:42,880
Speaker 0: All right, the chef Anthony Bourdain, which is I guess I know that that's the name of a famous chef.

234
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:44,239
Speaker 0: I don't know anything else about it.

235
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,420
Speaker 0: I just know that that is the name of a famous chef person and it's about food.

236
00:14:48,925 --> 00:14:50,239
Speaker 0: But yeah, you can tell by the cover.

237
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,811
Speaker 0: The only name on the cover that I care about is Paul Pope.

238
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:59,553
Speaker 0: like one of my favorite artists of all time He like he doesn't do a lot of stuff like anything he does.

239
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,080
Speaker 0: He's like Midas touch of artwork.

240
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:05,899
Speaker 0: And now that you can tell his artwork from like 10 miles away like no one draws like him anywhere.

241
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:09,630
Speaker 1: Is that just him Maya from my eccentric family?

242
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,460
Speaker 1: I don't know with his our ramen shop in hell.

243
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:23,777
Speaker 0: The other thing that is interesting is The seeds right by and the senti and David Aja, so I know who David Aja is.

244
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,365
Speaker 0: That's a familiar name I've heard before right?

245
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,291
Speaker 0: So that's gonna be really interesting.

246
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,340
Speaker 0: You've got this thing called the originals, right?

247
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:39,699
Speaker 0: So the originals is has the artists from Watchmen not Alan Moore Who's probably who know what the hell he's doing?

248
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:42,948
Speaker 0: Rolling around it's a mud somewhere.

249
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:50,696
Speaker 0: I don't know One of those retired and retired do who knows what he confirmed.

250
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:52,819
Speaker 1: he's retiring from comic books last year.

251
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,417
Speaker 0: sure, whatever No one cares your old man.

252
00:15:56,001 --> 00:16:03,755
Speaker 0: But Dave Givens the other Watchmen guy is starting a series called the originals and the cover looks like Fucking Watchmen art because it's the same fucking guy.

253
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:09,914
Speaker 0: Yep You got this thing Madahari, I guess it's about the real Madahari.

254
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:10,840
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

255
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:18,772
Speaker 0: and this other thing called Incognito Renaissance, which looks like mafia do incognito.

256
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:22,124
Speaker 1: It's a very specific period thing I couldn't tell from.

257
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,111
Speaker 0: it's hard to read that word that I've seen.

258
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,531
Speaker 1: this one in particular has been getting a lot of buzz in My feed lately.

259
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:28,139
Speaker 0: I don't know.

260
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,084
Speaker 0: I'm just looking at the knee like.

261
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:38,840
Speaker 0: I don't know who Matt Johnson and Warren police are but that doesn't matter Because I know Karen burgers, I'm gonna buy all of these books issue number one to see which ones are legit.

262
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,839
Speaker 1: So we basically just outlined a bunch of geek knives episodes that are coming up.

263
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much any.

264
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,019
Speaker 0: well, we'll probably do one episode all number ones.

265
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,728
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and then so forth right.

266
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:51,780
Speaker 0: and then like when I'm sure these won't be the only books this imprint publishes.

267
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:57,438
Speaker 0: Right these they're gonna figure out which ones succeed which ones fail which ones are limited which ones keep going forever, right?

268
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,356
Speaker 0: And new ones will come up.

269
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,451
Speaker 0: But this is like, you know comic book publisher to watch.

270
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:08,836
Speaker 0: if it has this name on it from Dark Horse It's worth at least checking it out.

271
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,965
Speaker 1: Yep Just the covers all these alone.

272
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:12,769
Speaker 1: I'm interested.

273
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,888
Speaker 1: if I saw these at some comic-con and I didn't know anything I'd probably pick them all up.

274
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:17,434
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

275
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:23,219
Speaker 1: So really quick news because this this like shockingly happened and I saw Twitter freaking out about it.

276
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:29,952
Speaker 1: I guess United Airlines Just randomly started telling people trying to fly home from San Diego.

277
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:32,760
Speaker 0: comic-con isn't United Airlines the one like every airline?

278
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:41,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, every single airline has bad stories about it in the news all the time But United is the one with the most bad and most frequent bad story.

279
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,660
Speaker 1: Well, so I would say that spirit is still a worse airline by every measure.

280
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,668
Speaker 0: I mean probably but it doesn't.

281
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,135
Speaker 0: it's not in the news for being.

282
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,400
Speaker 0: it's just generally bad.

283
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,980
Speaker 1: But I've been boycotting United for most of my life because but majority of the times I try to fly with them.

284
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like Spirit Airlines is just generally shitty.

285
00:17:58,674 --> 00:17:59,900
Speaker 0: That's like taking a Greyhound bus.

286
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,104
Speaker 0: It's just generally shitty.

287
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:06,360
Speaker 0: but United has specific horrific incidents that are frequently newsworthy.

288
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:20,714
Speaker 1: but in this case, they basically started telling people that the TSA said you can't check comic books and you check bags and That was egregious enough to even the TSA Which is an organization that I despise with literally every fiber of my being.

289
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:26,062
Speaker 1: even they were like No, that is not true WTF.

290
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:39,454
Speaker 0: this is probably just one relatively low-ranking employee doing a thing at that one Airport in San Diego from you know just like meh just Because who knows why they thought of doing this, but they just did for whatever reason.

291
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,307
Speaker 1: all these nerds showed up at the airport And I have sort of that.

292
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:45,055
Speaker 1: there's a buried lead in this story.

293
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:51,740
Speaker 1: I'll get to in a second Mm-hmm, but I guess a buried barb is a better a better way to put this but all they had all these signs.

294
00:18:52,041 --> 00:19:01,400
Speaker 1: comic-con attendees remove all books from check bags and A lot of people go to comic cons buy a lot of fucking books literally like bring extra luggage and fill.

295
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:03,348
Speaker 0: That is nothing but books.

296
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,633
Speaker 0: Yeah hundred percent book.

297
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:09,135
Speaker 1: My barb is simply Why are you buying so many comics at a comic-con?

298
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,040
Speaker 1: They're not cheaper there.

299
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,140
Speaker 1: This isn't like Silver Age Silver Surfer at Wizard World from a discount bin.

300
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:20,240
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is actually if you actually unless you're getting weird exclusive signed, I guess but how many?

301
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:26,640
Speaker 0: So if you're the kind of nerd who like is like you're only care about comic books.

302
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,981
Speaker 0: You don't.

303
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:30,712
Speaker 0: and you like the floppy shitty kind right or even the trade paperback kind.

304
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:48,990
Speaker 0: if you go to comic conventions and you're buying stuff that isn't brand new and Is Super old or rare, but it's just sort of like, you know Like a trade paperback that came out two years ago, and then they made too many copies and didn't sell them all.

305
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:57,090
Speaker 0: It's like if you try to buy those online They're not gonna be like two dollars, but at the convention, there's some comic store that's dealing there.

306
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,397
Speaker 0: That's just oh my god, please.

307
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,891
Speaker 0: I want to get rid of this inventory and they're selling it for $2.

308
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:13,390
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you buy a large quantity of that stuff You can reach an economic point to where the price of your comic-con badge the travel the hauling and if you're actually gonna read It all of course.

309
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,774
Speaker 0: So but I'm in the play.

310
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:16,419
Speaker 1: I can spin that back around.

311
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:24,033
Speaker 1: if you had to fly to get to San Diego comic-con That threshold is significantly higher Mm-hmm.

312
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:29,254
Speaker 0: You have to save at least the $50 that you Extra checked bag.

313
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:34,688
Speaker 1: also books ain't light and there's limits on how heavy bags can be.

314
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,052
Speaker 0: indeed I was.

315
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:39,443
Speaker 0: it's probably cheaper for the $50 of the checking bag.

316
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:40,948
Speaker 0: You could probably spend $40 at the FedEx.

317
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:50,204
Speaker 1: so my only guess is what actually happened here is that Someone maybe was trying to troll comic nerds and worked at United.

318
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:57,707
Speaker 1: That's possible purposefully Misinterpreted a TSA guideline to do this to cause havoc for the lulls.

319
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:58,410
Speaker 1: That's my guess.

320
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,178
Speaker 0: Oh, there's definitely possible.

321
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:08,670
Speaker 0: There are lots and lots of incidents where Individual employees have the power to do something but they're you know, the thing happens.

322
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:15,589
Speaker 0: It's you know No one knows no one outside knows why or how or who and it's just like it causes a bigger deal.

323
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,282
Speaker 0: then You know any that the person who did it thought would it would cause.

324
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:21,290
Speaker 0: now right and then he's just like oh shit.

325
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,507
Speaker 0: And then once it becomes a deal the coal company finds out about it and now you're fine.

326
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:34,166
Speaker 1: Yeah but anyway things of the day what he got?

327
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:39,887
Speaker 0: so Hockey comes in many varieties and we enjoy almost all of those varieties.

328
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:45,465
Speaker 0: the field kind The deck kind that guy he's okay.

329
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:50,261
Speaker 1: the ice kind Yeah, roller hockey is the only hockey I played any serious amount in my.

330
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:54,956
Speaker 0: so it's rather difficult for a normal person To play a lot of these kinds.

331
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:58,170
Speaker 0: right ice kind is the hardest even though it's the most common.

332
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,643
Speaker 0: Not only do you need to know how to skate but you need a venue.

333
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:02,030
Speaker 0: you know how to skate backwards.

334
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:04,521
Speaker 0: You need to have ice I need to have equipment.

335
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:06,470
Speaker 0: It's like it's a rich person's game.

336
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,794
Speaker 1: No I would argue polo.

337
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,650
Speaker 0: skill wise I guess polo is more expensive because you need a fucking horse and a horse cost more than hockey.

338
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,776
Speaker 0: equipment skill wise has to be maintained.

339
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:21,177
Speaker 1: ice hockey is way easier than roller hockey because roller blades like that not really designed for that playing that sport.

340
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:24,090
Speaker 1: the way hockey gets played doesn't work the same way, but anyway.

341
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,318
Speaker 0: But roller hockey is least eat a more accessible.

342
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:27,643
Speaker 0: if you want to just try.

343
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:29,350
Speaker 0: you see roller blades are cheaper.

344
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:31,302
Speaker 0: You don't need ice you know right.

345
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:32,429
Speaker 0: you know the equipment is less.

346
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:46,609
Speaker 0: It's a street right, but the point is almost all varieties of hockey except sticks no regular shoes on feet and nets with a ball is Really inaccessible right so?

347
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,430
Speaker 0: There was a type of hockey that I just discovered today.

348
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:59,696
Speaker 0: I want to play this real bad I'd never seen before and this type of hockey is a little bit less accessible than The other kinds.

349
00:23:00,017 --> 00:23:00,297
Speaker 0: right.

350
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,925
Speaker 0: then say just ball feet and whatever.

351
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:15,376
Speaker 0: I'd have to buy a few things But it is not out of the reach and does not most importantly does not require any skills of skating or rolling or anything like that And this is soap hockey.

352
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,801
Speaker 1: it requires balance.

353
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:21,342
Speaker 0: basically make a giant Rectangular slip and slide.

354
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:24,455
Speaker 0: you know a slip and slide is rectangular But it needs to be wider than that.

355
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:26,562
Speaker 0: right a big wide slip and slide.

356
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:35,630
Speaker 0: and rather than having water rushing down it You make it flat and cover it in soap liquidy soapy water, so it's fucking slippery as hell.

357
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,020
Speaker 1: And then just try to play hockey with that.

358
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:48,280
Speaker 0: you put two tiny nets balls and plastic sticks And you get out there, and you play hot and you fall on your ass as Grover Just pointed out ankle injury the game.

359
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,630
Speaker 0: Yes, it is ankle injury the game, but that's fine.

360
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,429
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm fine with ankle injury the game.

361
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:54,453
Speaker 0: I am.

362
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:57,162
Speaker 0: I am just not as let's safer than skiing.

363
00:23:57,423 --> 00:23:58,687
Speaker 0: it's even safer than I can in this.

364
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:01,555
Speaker 1: I would argue This is way less safe than skiing.

365
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:13,163
Speaker 0: listen the chances of being injured doing this way higher than skiing probably higher than skiing Safely I agree, but if you have an injury skiing You're probably going to break a leg or crack your head open.

366
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:18,427
Speaker 0: if you have an injury With the almost guaranteed injury of doing this is like spraying your ankle.

367
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:18,950
Speaker 0: big deal.

368
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,602
Speaker 1: I feel like cracked heads are a real possibility.

369
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:22,184
Speaker 1: lost teeth.

370
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:23,854
Speaker 1: I Fight.

371
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,668
Speaker 0: I think those are really unlikely.

372
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:33,418
Speaker 1: Running on slick surfaces swinging sticks around I think you sort of shuffle.

373
00:24:33,518 --> 00:24:34,240
Speaker 0: if you try to run.

374
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,485
Speaker 0: It's not gonna go well for you.

375
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,889
Speaker 1: I still want to play it.

376
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:38,554
Speaker 0: Absolutely would play this.

377
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:45,368
Speaker 0: if anyone wants to donate a big flat lawn doesn't mind it getting ruined by soap and being covered and trampled upon.

378
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,775
Speaker 0: And I'll go.

379
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:51,368
Speaker 0: I'll get the nets and sticks and balls and Amazon if you take care of the rest.

380
00:24:51,388 --> 00:25:22,670
Speaker 1: so I've been following a lot of different YouTube channels talking about like archaic technology mostly from the 60s 70s 80s and Tech mode is pretty good, but this video is really interesting because there's an area of technology I've been very interested in myself lately and that is Think about a task that you do today with computers basically and then realize that The task itself was done by professionals before computers were widespread and then try to figure out how the hell they did it.

381
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:28,710
Speaker 1: Like how did a sound board work before you could just have like wave files on a computer?

382
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,268
Speaker 1: like how did a DJ just make a particular sound play suddenly by hitting a button?

383
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:42,239
Speaker 1: and The answer is for many cases from the 60s through the 90s have lots of tapes Yeah, but even though some tapes aren't that accurate.

384
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,117
Speaker 1: They don't have like cue points at least cassette tapes Don't like standard cassette tapes.

385
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,530
Speaker 0: No, they had fancy tapes like DAT tapes and shit.

386
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:50,758
Speaker 1: No, so DAT tapes didn't solve this.

387
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,730
Speaker 1: they use something called a broadcast cart machine.

388
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,443
Speaker 1: Okay, and the tapes are spooled the same way.

389
00:25:56,504 --> 00:26:02,930
Speaker 1: that eight tracks are All right, and the base of the main reason these were important was that they'd play forever.

390
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,312
Speaker 1: You never.

391
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,990
Speaker 1: you could not rewind them, but you could always play them forever in a loop.

392
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,680
Speaker 0: Oh, it would go back to the beginning.

393
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know how that works.

394
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,730
Speaker 1: You ever see like an endless tape and what how those work?

395
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:13,721
Speaker 1: Yes, so cuz all eight track.

396
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:15,050
Speaker 1: you realize eight tracks are all like this, too.

397
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,442
Speaker 1: You could never rewind an eight track.

398
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:21,910
Speaker 1: You can only play forward Yep, and eight tracks actually did have eight tracks and there was a predecessor the four track.

399
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,870
Speaker 1: I had an eight track system that I played with a lot as a kid and I kept repairing because it broke.

400
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,123
Speaker 1: So I actually know a lot about eight tracks.

401
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:36,735
Speaker 1: But anyway Broadcast cart is the way like if you were at an event or you were a DJ and you needed sounds and jingles and things To be able to be queued up.

402
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:41,837
Speaker 1: the difference between any other tape mechanism of the era Was that it could be.

403
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:49,305
Speaker 1: it could start playing and stop playing nearly instantly Which is not like ever trying to pause a VCR at the at an exact spot.

404
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:50,409
Speaker 1: It's actually real hard.

405
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:53,450
Speaker 0: So did you like preset it with start and stop points or something?

406
00:26:53,510 --> 00:27:01,074
Speaker 1: You can manually start and stop it and it's like instant and it also has a mechanism for the machine queuing up The next sound.

407
00:27:01,114 --> 00:27:03,061
Speaker 1: that's on the tape couldn't you also?

408
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,410
Speaker 0: I mean, this is probably not the best way to do it.

409
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,438
Speaker 0: But it's possible right.

410
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,910
Speaker 0: just it says this tape is a loop.

411
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:16,509
Speaker 0: You get a really short tape that plays a tiny loop over and over and over again and it's always playing and you just turn It down on the mixer and then when you want to hear it, you just mix it up and mix it down.

412
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,429
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, I've you can die.

413
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,410
Speaker 1: Oftentimes at an event you'll do a loop track like that.

414
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,896
Speaker 1: And this the one that.

415
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:29,602
Speaker 1: so in this video they have a giant track tape that he finds That's like super super long and he basically when it's really long.

416
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,938
Speaker 1: He repairs it to figure out what the hell was on it Mm-hmm and the machine to play it.

417
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, this channel is all about having the machines for this nonsense.

418
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,316
Speaker 1: Okay, but yeah, that is the thing that some people would do.

419
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:49,789
Speaker 1: but this is a really interesting video talking about the very like Challenging problem of doing that kind of thing before computers existed that we got to just take for granted now.

420
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:53,967
Speaker 0: Hmm I guess you could also do it with vinyl if you knew the exact spot to put the needle.

421
00:27:53,987 --> 00:28:01,610
Speaker 1: you put it Take it off real fast But you have to be really skilled Ah, but also vinyl doesn't really start playing immediately cuz you're gonna get that scratch noise when you put the needle down.

422
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you would that's right.

423
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one use vinyl for that.

424
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,450
Speaker 0: They have nowadays.

425
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:19,884
Speaker 0: I've heard that there are some record players that will use a laser and not a needle to like optically read the Record, so I learned about basically means it's a CD at that point Except worse quality because vinyl is not actually that high fidelity.

426
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,430
Speaker 1: Jesus do not even fight me.

427
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,840
Speaker 0: I don't understand why people are so hyped on vinyl.

428
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,888
Speaker 0: even still I keep seeing like in my Twitter feed.

429
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:27,790
Speaker 0: occasionally Someone's like, oh man bought new vinyl.

430
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,734
Speaker 0: I'm like what the fuck.

431
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:34,154
Speaker 0: and if and if your argument is you're like a record company starts producing more vinyl It's like people it's garbage.

432
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:39,830
Speaker 1: if you're into the cool old technology like the weird old tape stuff is way more interesting.

433
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,428
Speaker 0: This is cool, but we're not gonna buy any of these ever.

434
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:54,361
Speaker 1: Though also, uh, I would point out that the end run of analog cassettes like the height that technology got to before they're obsoleted by CDs is Nearly indistinguishable from CD quality.

435
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,687
Speaker 1: if you got like Dolby s going on.

436
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:59,939
Speaker 1: Mmm It's just the CDs sort of displaced that too quickly.

437
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:00,401
Speaker 1: Mmm.

438
00:29:00,962 --> 00:29:02,947

447
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,629
Speaker 1: The arc of man is having knives used on it.

450
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:48,970
Speaker 0: He who breaks horses is actually broken less horses than everyone else in this book so far.

451
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm disappointed.

452
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:58,069
Speaker 0: not one horse broken by the official horse breaker But many horses broken by others who wouldn't even know how to break a horse.

453
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:04,070
Speaker 0: They're mere mere amateurs compared to the true master of horse breaking.

454
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:11,076
Speaker 1: Otherwise the next convention we're gonna be at is Pax West Mothership packs the real the ticket.

469
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:24,946
Speaker 0: So that means we're gonna be going to every not just the final omega-thon round as usual But every round unless row loses we're making sure we'll just be going to the last round.

470
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,030

Speaker 1: so let's get right.

475
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:37,750
Speaker 0: as I mean that would make this packs like even more epic than usual.

00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,282
Speaker 0: that's like up.

478
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:44,705
Speaker 1: Well think of it this way if she wins One that means that I'll she'll go to PAX Australia.

479
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,550
Speaker 0: We're all gonna go to back.

480
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,161
Speaker 1: So yeah, but to the the after packs feast.

481
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:53,621
Speaker 1: while it will not be in the most wonderful bathroom that we've ever seen it'll be somewhere.

482
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:58,184
Speaker 0: and Imagine we'll go to the fancy restaurant instead of the regular restaurant.

483
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,890
Speaker 0: We'll go to the fanciest place we can find.

484
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll.

485
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:06,943
Speaker 1: it'll be a feast of celebration like a place that caused mad money Mad money the meat.

486
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:07,728
Speaker 0: That's right.

487
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:09,684
Speaker 1: So yeah.

488
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:23,586
Speaker 1: So if you didn't hear Netflix made a four episode TV series animated of Castlevania 3 is it Castlevania 3 really curse of Dracula?

489
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:24,690
Speaker 1: you didn't did it.

490
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,310
Speaker 0: I thought it was just Castlevania generic.

491
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:35,309
Speaker 1: So you didn't notice a la card and Sifa The only person we didn't see that we need to see to make it fully Castlevania 3 is grant and I assume he's gonna be there.

492
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:36,416
Speaker 0: I thought the next season.

493
00:32:36,436 --> 00:32:37,341
Speaker 0: I thought they can't.

494
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:39,633
Speaker 0: a la card isn't until like PlayStation He should.

495
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:41,543
Speaker 0: did you ever play Castlevania 3?

496
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,467
Speaker 0: I didn't beat it.

497
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:43,532
Speaker 1: Did you ever?

498
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:46,625
Speaker 1: did you ever get a character other than Trevor Belmont?

499
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:47,589
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

500
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:57,349
Speaker 1: You realize the whole shtick with that game was that you run into Sifa a la card and grant Depending on the routes you take through Dracula's castle.

501
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:07,290
Speaker 0: and I think I had to go back and play Castlevania 3 because All I know about Castlevania 3 is a. it's a lot like Castlevania 1 style not Castlevania 2 style.

502
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:08,055
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a big it.

503
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:10,109
Speaker 1: actually it's a kind of a hybrid of the two.

504
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,389
Speaker 0: There's a big hullabaloo about the audio in that game.

505
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:17,796
Speaker 0: Japanese cartridge had a much better Soundship and better.

506
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:20,630
Speaker 0: amazing incredible music considering was an NES game.

507
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the American cartridge had crap music by comparison.

508
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:32,730
Speaker 1: So Scott although pretty good by comparison to other crap NES games You can play as all these different characters and there's different ending.

509
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:35,360
Speaker 0: I guess I'm gonna go emulate and beat Castlevania 3.

510
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,946
Speaker 1: then I don't think you will.

511
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:37,830
Speaker 0: you don't think I will.

512
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:43,090
Speaker 1: Castlevania 3 how hard could it be might be the hardest Castlevania that was ever.

513
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,816
Speaker 1: It cannot be.

514
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:46,874
Speaker 1: Castlevania 1 is also.

515
00:33:46,935 --> 00:33:52,330
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play the Japanese version because I want that better Japanese version is easier by most accounts.

516
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,334
Speaker 0: I just want the better audio.

517
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:55,423
Speaker 1: What uh, uh, well your emulator do that.

518
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:55,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

519
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:59,379
Speaker 1: Well, you sure will Yeah, make sure your emulator supports that weird chip.

520
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,564
Speaker 0: It will definitely support it.

521
00:34:01,186 --> 00:34:01,788
Speaker 0: What year is it?

522
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,926
Speaker 1: Anyway, I can't believe you did.

523
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:17,290
Speaker 1: So yeah This is literally one of the first times in human history That a television show or movie was made based directly on a video game and it was good.

524
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,746
Speaker 0: Why did they choose?

525
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,714
Speaker 0: Castlevania 3 specifically.

526
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:26,053
Speaker 0: so I was not say Symphony of the Night or Aria of sorrow or any of the other Castlevania.

527
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,943
Speaker 1: so I thought there'd be a short answer to that question.

528
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:33,138
Speaker 1: It turns out there's a very Long answer to that question.

529
00:34:33,178 --> 00:34:36,610
Speaker 0: should we answer this long question or should people just go to the internet and read it for the?

530
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,541
Speaker 1: If you want me to tell you I'm literally on the Wikipedia page.

531
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:41,121
Speaker 1: Just read it.

532
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:50,330
Speaker 1: But this summarize it the The production of this Castlevania series had a long and torturous path.

533
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,657
Speaker 1: There's no upside down castle yet.

534
00:34:57,677 --> 00:34:57,978
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:59,344
Speaker 1: Yeah this came out in 2017, right?

536
00:34:59,364 --> 00:34:59,484
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

537
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:07,182
Speaker 1: so I'm just gonna read the first sentence of the summary of how this came to be and you'll see why it's hard to summarize.

538
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:20,695
Speaker 1: quote in March of 2007. ten years ago Frederator Studios acquired the bravest warriors acquired the rights to produce an animated film adaptation specifically of Castlevania 3.

539
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:22,521
Speaker 0: why does this have anything to do with this current?

540
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:24,709
Speaker 1: because that is where this current thing came from?

541
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,837
Speaker 0: It's not a completely brand new deal Like this up the old remains of this.

542
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:33,539
Speaker 1: this Literally, you know hard it was for this to get made.

543
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,113
Speaker 1: it got stuck in development hell like twice All right.

544
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:50,690
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this new this Castlevania 3 animated adaptation looks a Lot like what people would say is anime even though we know there's no such thing as look like anime because anime comes in

545
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:59,273
Speaker 1: Evoke that especially if you look at stills from it that very specific feeling of late 80s and early to mid 90s Violent away views.

546
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:03,305
Speaker 0: It looks like vampire hunter D or demon city or ninja scroll.

547
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:05,110
Speaker 0: It looks like those anime style.

548
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,116
Speaker 0: That's the visual style.

549
00:36:06,156 --> 00:36:18,384
Speaker 0: It has right but it is written by Warren Ellis a Credible great writer author of many works such as trans metropolitan fell Next world, what else is he written?

550
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:18,928
Speaker 0: That's really good.

551
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:20,909
Speaker 0: Those are the big ones that I can think of.

552
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,885
Speaker 0: Yeah But Warren Ellis is usually if you see his name on something that means good writings are here.

553
00:36:25,945 --> 00:36:27,490
Speaker 1: read this comic and it was general.

554
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:34,506
Speaker 1: It was a pretty big International production involving a ton of different studios and production companies and people

555
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:43,268
Speaker 0: but not Japanese people Which is why it is not anime, but it doesn't matter if it's anime or not It's an animated work and I don't really give a shit about if it's anime or not.

556
00:36:43,428 --> 00:36:51,270
Speaker 1: Yep Though I will say while the stills so so heavily evoked those 90s OAVs as does the story and the violence.

557
00:36:51,932 --> 00:37:06,706
Speaker 1: But and I had this very specific and odd reaction as soon as I was watching it a few minutes in I Really was reminded of the way a on flux was Animated in terms of like the way the camera would move and the way the characters

558
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,810
Speaker 0: not if you mean not a lot.

559
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:14,192
Speaker 1: Yeah It doesn't move much and there's just the way the faces looked in the way the characters sort of look past each other instead of At each other.

560
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:19,890
Speaker 1: so I got this really strong like rain or a on flux vibe just from that.

561
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:29,128
Speaker 0: Yeah and the dialogue is all that like very stilted like only saying what needs to be said sort of feels like there's a like a Millisecond too much pause in between people talking to each other.

562
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:33,340
Speaker 0: and yeah But the thing is.

563
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,889
Speaker 0: that's the way those 90s things like Ninja Scroll felt when they were dubbed.

564
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,917
Speaker 1: This feels too easy.

565
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,624
Speaker 0: This is original English language.

566
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:42,090
Speaker 0: This isn't some Japanese thing.

567
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,713
Speaker 0: That was right.

568
00:37:42,753 --> 00:37:46,830
Speaker 1: This is but if it feels like watching the dove of vampire hunter D, right?

569
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,036
Speaker 0: It's a little bit.

570
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:49,888
Speaker 0: the voice acting is a little bit better than that.

571
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:53,095
Speaker 0: There's like if one of the voice actors like a famous person, right?

572
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:53,656
Speaker 0: What's his name?

573
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,059
Speaker 1: Oh Richard Armitage.

574
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:55,820
Speaker 0: Yeah that guy.

575
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:57,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, the voice acting is good.

576
00:37:58,155 --> 00:37:59,700
Speaker 1: However, the script is a little bit.

577
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:13,357
Speaker 1: People say fucking piss a lot for just because yeah Like it was it feels like the kind of language that some dubs of those old anime OAVs Is.

578
00:38:13,397 --> 00:38:15,410
Speaker 0: the original dialogue isn't translated.

579
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:27,570
Speaker 1: however, I was reading this interview with the producer of Castlevania and It's very telling what they drew from because basically the anime seems like the person medium for Castlevania.

580
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,781
Speaker 1: You mentioned ghost in the shell and ninja scroll and other interviews.

581
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:33,550
Speaker 1: what anime creatively informed this series?

582
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:38,048
Speaker 1: And the answer is and I quote vampire hunter D was an early reference.

583
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:44,289
Speaker 1: Yeah space pirate Harlock for the use of color Oh Berserk as an example of what to do.

584
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,227
Speaker 1: There's a lot of berserk going and the CGI reboot as an example of what not to do.

585
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:55,329
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, no, there's definitely a lot of berserk going on in this year in this year show for sure.

586
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,439
Speaker 1: Uh, I really liked it.

587
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,706
Speaker 1: I mean we're gonna talk about it in depth.

588
00:38:58,746 --> 00:38:59,570
Speaker 1: It's only four episodes.

589
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,676
Speaker 0: So it's four short episodes.

590
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:02,318
Speaker 0: just watch it.

591
00:39:02,538 --> 00:39:03,542
Speaker 0: yeah, it's not.

592
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:13,187
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say it's like it's not great, right but it's like if you have Netflix and you're a nerd and you're like a vampire or you like anime or you like violence or you like.

593
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:16,219
Speaker 0: it's like it's worth Your 80 minutes of your life.

594
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it's not that long.

595
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:18,830
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the hell out of it.

596
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:21,109
Speaker 0: I didn't enjoy the hell out of it, but it was like, all right.

597
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:26,410
Speaker 0: So the plot is basically if it was, you know, if it wasn't Castlevania, it might have been like man.

598
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,240
Speaker 0: So spike speak, I think the fact that it is Castlevania puts it over the phone.

599
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:39,609
Speaker 1: and tonight spike Spiegel reincarnated as Trevor Belmont Fine meets a wizard girl and they go into a dungeon to wake up Ellen Chazar from Escaflowne.

600
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,523
Speaker 1: You go fight Dracula exactly.

601
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:42,330
Speaker 0: That is the plot.

602
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,961
Speaker 0: Well, the actual plot is that Dracula was Dean his usual self.

603
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:48,730
Speaker 0: his castle reappeared once every whatever number of years.

604
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,567
Speaker 1: Dracula's a chill dude.

605
00:39:51,052 --> 00:40:04,559
Speaker 0: Relatively well, I mean he's not super chill He's an evil vampire dude But he's not like destroying the world or anything Right, and then some lady comes to visit him because she heard that he's got mad science Which he does because he's like fucking immortal and he knows shit.

606
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,958
Speaker 0: that beginning scene is my favorite scene and in the dark ages People don't know shit, right?

607
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:10,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, she shows up and she's like the peasants are all dumb.

608
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:18,216
Speaker 0: Castle is like a fucking cave of wonders full of awesomeness and she's like she convinces Dracula like hey Let me have your science.

609
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:19,765
Speaker 0: and he's like, alright, you're hot.

610
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:20,590
Speaker 0: I'll go with it.

611
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I'm still a dude even though I'm an immortal, dude.

612
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,889
Speaker 1: Well also it was interesting because she shows up and she's clearly not afraid of him.

613
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,319
Speaker 0: She doesn't know she's a woman of science.

614
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,450
Speaker 0: He doesn't know that Dracula is all like vampire and shit.

615
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:38,457
Speaker 0: She just thinks he's a rich old you know dude who lives in a castle full of science.

616
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:43,796
Speaker 1: and that aspect of it is really interesting because there's like a big part of the plot.

617
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:50,210
Speaker 1: is that Dracula vampires because they're long-lived have science they have light bulbs and things.

618
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:59,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's cool how like Trevor Belmont remembers all the you know The knowledge of his family and he talks a lot like did you see those strange implements and blah blah blah, right?

619
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,353
Speaker 0: That's the.

620
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:03,150
Speaker 1: that's the legend of what's inside Dracula's castle.

621
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:08,310
Speaker 0: But the world is clearly in a dark age has much lower technology than the vampires.

622
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,769
Speaker 1: I mean, it's what 1400s right people in Wallachia.

623
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,284
Speaker 0: It's like the towards the end of the Middle Ages in the United States.

624
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:18,049
Speaker 0: Yeah in the real world Europe.

625
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:27,247
Speaker 1: Now here's the real question does Dracula's castle Travel through time such that that is that precursor technology is actually his future technology?

626
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:31,053
Speaker 1: did vampires independently invent electricity?

627
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:41,370
Speaker 0: and all this because they live a long time and they're bored or Live a long time and they're bored because if it was time-traveling he'd have like, you know Internet in his yes Or was there a precursor?

628
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,709
Speaker 1: Civilization and the memory of that is all that remains.

629
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:46,094
Speaker 0: Also think.

630
00:41:46,154 --> 00:42:00,306
Speaker 0: part of it is that in the past there were times when Dracula's castle appeared because it's reappeared so many times that there have been times when it's appeared that you know Dracula has had like, you know, huge armies or slaves or who knows what.

631
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:01,330
Speaker 0: we're building things.

632
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:06,108
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like the castle was made at some point by a whole bunch of people that Dracula had forced to build.

633
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:12,090
Speaker 0: he didn't build it By hand on his own but the very beginning of this he was a king right his account at least he had people.

634
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:20,494
Speaker 1: But it seems like in that initial little bit because this like this whole backstory is like a minute of screen time Right just to set the stage.

635
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:28,901
Speaker 1: because and I'm glad they did it because if you don't give some sort of reason Dracula's just this like bad bad guy.

636
00:42:28,961 --> 00:42:32,335
Speaker 0: I mean like Symphony the night where it's like What is a man?

637
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:33,117
Speaker 0: a pile of secrets?

638
00:42:33,138 --> 00:42:34,161
Speaker 0: Hahaha Dracula?

639
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,225
Speaker 0: All right now try to kill me.

640
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,510
Speaker 0: the ends like go go go.

641
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:38,468
Speaker 0: It's like why I don't you know anything about you.

642
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:52,659
Speaker 0: It's like all right, I guess I have to kill Dracula cuz he bad he Dracula yep, but uh from the first like 10 minutes this show Dracula Kind of justified not fully justified by.

643
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,542
Speaker 0: so the issue it right.

644
00:42:53,562 --> 00:43:01,090
Speaker 0: So what they do is they basically give Dracula a Refrigerator reason for being evil, right?

645
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:04,879
Speaker 0: They take his wife murder his his wife.

646
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:06,243
Speaker 0: So now he mad right?

647
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,089
Speaker 0: It's the old fridge scenario.

648
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:10,976
Speaker 0: No It's like all right.

649
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:14,650
Speaker 0: You have your reason you're you're you know, but also rope reason.

650
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,946
Speaker 1: But the church drag that murdered his wife way more evil than Dracula, right?

651
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:26,696
Speaker 0: The difference is though is that Dracula's vengeance cuz he's so powerful is Way over the top.

652
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:28,804
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, not only is he taking it out on the church.

653
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,149
Speaker 0: He's killing all humans.

654
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:31,774
Speaker 0: Kill all humans.

655
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,304
Speaker 1: It implies that he's only gonna kill all the humans in Wallachia.

656
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:35,870
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all humans.

657
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:38,242
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't feel like there's anything outside of.

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,146
Speaker 0: will I get in this?

659
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:41,950
Speaker 0: in this Joe I mean there has to be the whole world.

660
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:42,753
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't.

661
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:46,287
Speaker 1: I don't know how closely the castle in your world is set in the world.

662
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:55,844
Speaker 1: Yeah But basically he even gives them a sporting chance though He comes back and he's like I'm gonna fucking kill you all in one year.

663
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:58,050
Speaker 1: So leave or make your peace.

664
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,858
Speaker 1: I'll be back and the bishops like.

665
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,576
Speaker 1: he's not coming back and it's not really a spoiler But there's this great coming back.

666
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:09,290
Speaker 1: exactly when he said he would where the bishop is literally giving mass and he's like.

667
00:44:10,492 --> 00:44:19,090
Speaker 1: Dracula said Almost one year ago to this very moment that he would come back and kill us in one year and we're still alive.

668
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:23,846
Speaker 1: He didn't come back and then the sky starts raining blood and a whole bunch of vampire hunter.

669
00:44:23,906 --> 00:44:25,090
Speaker 1: D happens all at once.

670
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,337
Speaker 0: Dracula's like here.

671
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:26,679
Speaker 0: I am.

672
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,469
Speaker 0: I promised I'm here.

673
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,178
Speaker 0: Listen I was you know, yep.

674
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:32,262
Speaker 0: I'm Dracula.

675
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:32,724
Speaker 0: I got time.

676
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:34,029
Speaker 0: a year for me is like a second.

677
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:35,575
Speaker 0: That's like.

678
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:36,542
Speaker 0: I'll be back in a minute guys.

679
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:41,007
Speaker 1: I'm gonna pee and come back but it basically takes all the like.

680
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:55,861
Speaker 1: the formal story that like could be gleaned from Castlevania 3 takes those bits and pieces and gives them just enough interesting context to drive the story forward without Like ruminating too deeply on the details of the lore.

681
00:44:55,901 --> 00:45:02,589
Speaker 1: like it you get impressions like the Belmont family Are all like mysterious and have powers and the shit.

682
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:08,290
Speaker 1: You're the only one left and because the the church turned on them to the church basically fucked everything up in this.

683
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:14,710
Speaker 0: Well, that seems to what always has another trope right is like there's a there's a some good people's but they're like.

684
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,569
Speaker 0: You know their job is to fight the evil.

685
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:24,916
Speaker 0: But now the evil has been gone for so long that now those they seem like crazy be like the mandate and the prince of Nothing exactly.

686
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:26,122
Speaker 0: It's the same exact thing.

687
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:29,213
Speaker 0: So basically the mandate Belmonts here.

688
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:42,907
Speaker 1: Actually, it's very close to that because the Belmonts like the speakers and the vampire It's a. so the speakers the Belmonts and the vampires all know how the world works and are smart and then the regular people Don't know shit.

689
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:48,787
Speaker 1: The church is actively evil and regular people are the dumbest beings who have ever existed.

690
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:52,140
Speaker 0: other medieval peasants Yeah, but it's not fair to them.

691
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,868
Speaker 0: They didn't have opportunity for education.

692
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:54,390
Speaker 1: That is true.

693
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:56,729
Speaker 0: But this show really single school in this show.

694
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:04,050
Speaker 1: This show really goes out of its way to hammer into your head how dumb the normal people are in this world, right?

695
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,949
Speaker 0: I mean, well, the first thing is this science lady who comes to Dracula's castle and she's like yo.

696
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:09,817
Speaker 0: People in this world are really dumb.

697
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:10,902
Speaker 0: They won't listen to my science.

698
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,790
Speaker 0: If only I could science them I could save them.

699
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they're also Dracula's like.

700
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,645
Speaker 1: alright science away.

701
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,961
Speaker 0: Yeah Everyone's so done.

702
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:32,590
Speaker 1: There is a scene That because the show is only four episodes It's a high percentage of the total dialogue spoken and it is a long debate about the logistics and punishments for sheep-fucking.

703
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:42,750
Speaker 1: yeah, and Like that scene you think it's gonna be a joke and it just keeps going and going and they they're really talking about this.

704
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,670
Speaker 0: Is that the one in the tavern?

705
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:51,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah with with the really ugly guy the less ugly guy the stringy ugly guy and the bartender who looks like the bartender from Cowboy bebop the tavern scene.

706
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:53,826
Speaker 0: I think only exists to introduce Trevor, right?

707
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:54,750
Speaker 0: He's the quiet guy.

708
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,840
Speaker 1: I think it also exists to introduce the culture of those peasants.

709
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's the.

710
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,047
Speaker 0: he's the quiet guy.

711
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:01,090
Speaker 0: It's all these tropes, right?

712
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:06,230
Speaker 0: He's the quiet guy sitting in the back of the tavern not saying anything, but he makes all these vehicle faces all the time.

713
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:10,607
Speaker 0: All the disgruntled peasants make a ruckus in there.

714
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:15,623
Speaker 1: Yeah But He really like he'll almost it.

715
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:22,167
Speaker 1: it doesn't really hurt the show But sometimes he makes kind of a stereotypical anime face and that doesn't really fit.

716
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,657
Speaker 1: the rest of the way The face is usually drawn.

717
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:25,099
Speaker 0: Yeah.

718
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:29,333
Speaker 0: But anyway, the highlight of the show for me is Actually the action scenes.

719
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:34,829
Speaker 0: Oh, so sword fight the most sort for animation and most of the show is middling.

720
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,569
Speaker 0: to average There's a few times where it sort of looks kind of man.

721
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:41,079
Speaker 0: You know a little weirdness and the way things move.

722
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:57,342
Speaker 0: during times when things don't move much they move a little bit They move weirdly right but when there's action scenes They put in like super effort into them to where they're not quite as good as like say the fight in episode one of cowboy Bebop or something like that where it's like majestically animated.

723
00:47:57,362 --> 00:48:02,065
Speaker 0: they're close, but it's still like a wow Situation like the one where they takes the dude's eyeball out.

724
00:48:02,386 --> 00:48:05,044
Speaker 1: Oh that whip You said you said something.

725
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:05,910
Speaker 1: cuz you watch it before me.

726
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:09,119
Speaker 0: I specifically remember this one part where he was.

727
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:24,070
Speaker 0: it was a shot of Trevor and he was whipping right now And it was showing basically him from his shoulders up his arms in his head And that was the whole taking up the whole frame and he was whipping like with both hands whip whip whip Right or it looked like he was whipping with both hands.

728
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:35,330
Speaker 0: It might have been one hand whipping back and forth and I could tell that for like one second of animation His whipping movement looped like three times and I was like, how long are they gonna loop this whipping animation?

729
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:44,090
Speaker 0: and then as soon as I thought that at the speed of thought it changed to a Different whipping loop and then changed to a third different whipping loop.

730
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:49,668
Speaker 0: So they normally someone doing cheapo animation would have had one loop of whipping.

731
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:50,370
Speaker 0: now, right?

732
00:48:50,670 --> 00:49:02,583
Speaker 0: They animated three different ways of whipping right for like three seconds like whip whip whip whip whip whip and then a different whip whip whip and I was like Oh, they actually like it could tell like ooh, it's visually interesting.

733
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:03,726
Speaker 0: What is happening?

734
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:03,987
Speaker 0: Yes.

735
00:49:04,328 --> 00:49:04,950
Speaker 0: He's just whipping.

736
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,745
Speaker 0: There's nothing happening in the story other than violence to like the there's.

737
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:11,670
Speaker 1: so there's a bunch of vampire hunter D Like things getting kind of have violence.

738
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,055
Speaker 0: But like this applies.

739
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:15,844
Speaker 0: this same principle applies to all of the action scenes.

740
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:16,667
Speaker 0: with like especially.

741
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,510
Speaker 0: we just fight in Alucard.

742
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:25,729
Speaker 1: Well when he fights that dirt priest right away and he's be whips to knock the dagger out of his hand Yeah, and then you see the guy dude's finger just like land next to the dagger and you're like, ooh.

743
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,430
Speaker 0: And then he think he makes a funny comment about the thing.

744
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:33,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, he does if I remember correctly then he whips the other guy's eye out and he's like, well, yeah I was when he whipped the eyeball.

745
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:35,541
Speaker 0: I was like, oh pie may steal your eyeball.

746
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:35,822
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:39,215
Speaker 1: Oh, I think the best fight though Was the Alan Shehzar fight?

748
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:42,630
Speaker 1: Yes, because that because the way Alucard moved was great.

749
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:45,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean and his sword is Appropriately weird and right.

750
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:51,050
Speaker 0: he moves in a way that is appropriate for him to move and he also floats around a lot.

751
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:51,633
Speaker 1: Yeah,

752
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:54,751
Speaker 0: you know, it's like ooh, they didn't just make him, you know do boring stuff and

753
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,318
Speaker 1: I also like how it did they

754
00:49:56,358 --> 00:49:57,463
Speaker 0: do as he needs to be,

755
00:49:57,604 --> 00:50:06,810
Speaker 1: you know, how Dune has the that the moment of There's a conflict that would be boring in any other thing and then the characters just talk and then the situation is resolved.

756
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,595
Speaker 0: He just talks to Alucard and is resolved.

757
00:50:08,696 --> 00:50:08,936
Speaker 0: Yep.

758
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:10,100
Speaker 1: It's like Alucard's like.

759
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,043
Speaker 1: I'm not Dracula.

760
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:12,166
Speaker 0: I'm Alucard.

761
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:14,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay I'm the son of Dracula.

762
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,282
Speaker 0: Oh and I want to kill him.

763
00:50:16,402 --> 00:50:21,137
Speaker 0: Are you know, I guess I'll believe you because You don't look like Dracula to me.

764
00:50:21,901 --> 00:50:25,637
Speaker 0: You're not killing me and biting me right now Which Dracula totally would.

765
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:26,621
Speaker 0: he would just kill us right now.

766
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:28,228
Speaker 1: So I don't he might not.

767
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:30,578
Speaker 1: No, it depends we did.

768
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:32,288
Speaker 1: I don't think we've personally pissed Dracula off.

769
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:36,689
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure if someone went to visit Dracula at that time when he was pissed.

770
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:40,504
Speaker 1: You don't visit Dracula right after the church murdered his wife.

771
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:41,529
Speaker 1: You can't let him be.

772
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:44,193
Speaker 0: They're gonna visit him.

773
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:46,722
Speaker 0: they're just gonna visit him with like whips and crosses and holy.

774
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:47,404
Speaker 0: I like how all.

775
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:48,086
Speaker 0: that's another thing.

776
00:50:48,488 --> 00:51:01,230
Speaker 0: they usually When you have something based on a video game you sort of shoehorn the game mechanics into it In an awkward and kind of Blair way like a whip is was probably the lowest.

777
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:02,950
Speaker 0: I'm having a whip as his weapon.

778
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:08,234
Speaker 0: Okay, right, but it's not like he didn't whip a wall and have a meat come out But like which he's not.

779
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:11,830
Speaker 1: ops that was guarding Sifa cuz that have that's in the game, right?

780
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:13,015
Speaker 0: That's perfectly fine.

781
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:15,390
Speaker 0: But the example was actually the holy waters in the game.

782
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:15,954
Speaker 0: It's not like.

783
00:51:16,216 --> 00:51:23,170
Speaker 0: it's not like it would have been lame if he Hit a candle with his whip by accident and found a holy water behind it in a vial and then threw it.

784
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:24,928
Speaker 1: Find some wall meat right.

785
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:29,387
Speaker 0: that Super lame corny hackin eatin bad instead.

786
00:51:29,427 --> 00:51:29,890
Speaker 0: what they did?

787
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,333
Speaker 0: He's like.

788
00:51:30,636 --> 00:51:33,334
Speaker 0: there was a point at which he was like you Priest man.

789
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:37,490
Speaker 0: go get water from the well and bless it and bring it back and then he tossed it on something.

790
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:46,969
Speaker 0: It's like I don't seen where he's worked in the holy water from the game to make it still, Castlevania But not in a way that's corny and video gamey in a way that just makes sense.

791
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:52,437
Speaker 0: You're if you never played Castlevania, you wouldn't think anything of it wouldn't be awkward Hadn't played Castlevania?

792
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:55,570
Speaker 0: and a dude hits a candle with his whip and holy water comes out.

793
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:55,997
Speaker 0: You're just like.

794
00:51:56,018 --> 00:51:56,670
Speaker 0: what the fuck is this shit?

795
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:02,011
Speaker 1: But it also draws from the fact that like in the in the story itself or a guy finds a meat in a wall of A house.

796
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:04,819
Speaker 1: the Belmont family knows things.

797
00:52:04,879 --> 00:52:08,970
Speaker 1: their primary power is their knowledge and their bloodline which hasn't really been gotten into yet.

798
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if it'll get into that.

799
00:52:10,654 --> 00:52:11,056
Speaker 1: We'll see.

800
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,479
Speaker 0: Castlevania bloodlines.

801
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,224
Speaker 1: See you get some Simon Belmont.

802
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,508
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the best one.

803
00:52:15,748 --> 00:52:19,485
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, Simon might be the most powerful Belmont.

804
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:23,239
Speaker 1: until the new era I was reading I was really is Richter stronger.

805
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:24,683
Speaker 1: I don't know.

806
00:52:24,723 --> 00:52:25,244
Speaker 0: I don't know any.

807
00:52:25,285 --> 00:52:27,110
Speaker 0: I don't know enough about Castlevania lore.

808
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:28,629
Speaker 0: I just played Castlevania games.

809
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:36,230
Speaker 0: I haven't played all of them, but like I don't know the lore because I don't pay attention to that I just kill Dracula every time and explore his castle.

810
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:38,690
Speaker 0: I know the horn it for as evil as drag.

811
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,616
Speaker 0: I know the three.

812
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,619
Speaker 1: I played as a kid when I was obsessed with this stuff, which is Played on the DS.

813
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,109
Speaker 0: I don't know the lore of and I played him.

814
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:54,071
Speaker 0: Well those I Was I know nothing about are like the GBA ones which I tried to play and couldn't and just because of technology reasons couldn't Get.

815
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:54,833
Speaker 1: I am confident.

816
00:52:54,874 --> 00:52:56,901
Speaker 1: You will not beat Castlevania 3.

817
00:52:56,901 --> 00:52:58,226
Speaker 1: I never beat it in my whole life.

818
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:01,663
Speaker 1: Really we Gonna be alright Zelda too hard.

819
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:05,930
Speaker 1: I can do it whenever the weather's bad like in the next several like whenever we feel it.

820
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:12,850
Speaker 1: Let's both live stream ourselves playing Castlevania 3 and idly and just see who like if either one of us beats it Because as a kid I never beat it.

821
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,453
Speaker 0: I mean I'll use.

822
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,664
Speaker 0: you know if I could use save states and cheat if I have to.

823
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:16,730
Speaker 1: I won't use save states.

824
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:17,815
Speaker 1: That's too much cheating.

825
00:53:17,835 --> 00:53:19,725
Speaker 0: The thing is when you die you go back to beginning, right?

826
00:53:20,629 --> 00:53:21,835
Speaker 1: Uh It's a hard game.

827
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:23,582
Speaker 1: It's a real hard game.

828
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:24,727
Speaker 0: It can't be that it's.

829
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:25,530
Speaker 0: it's beatable.

830
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,305
Speaker 1: It is I would say it's like five times harder than Castlevania 1.

831
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:30,610
Speaker 0: I'll watch a speedrun and copy it.

832
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:37,202
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I just watched a speedrun of it and Jesus The Japanese version I think I can be.

833
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:38,329
Speaker 0: I can beat the Super Nintendo one.

834
00:53:39,214 --> 00:53:41,989
Speaker 1: I think the Super Nintendo one because he can dangle dangly.

835
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:44,736
Speaker 0: My favorite move whip dangle.

836
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:46,381
Speaker 1: I like the Super Nintendo one.

837
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:50,012
Speaker 1: I feel like as many three is a way way harder Hmm.

838
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:53,204
Speaker 1: I I usually tried to get grant cuz.

839
00:53:53,244 --> 00:53:57,422
Speaker 1: I did better as grant I think but Grant will see you probably in the second season.

840
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:06,186
Speaker 1: Uh say if you enjoy Ultra violence like vampire hunter if you like 90s violent animes if you like vampires.

841
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:09,460
Speaker 0: if you like Castlevania Then you have and you haven't.

842
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,289
Speaker 0: I wouldn't pay for Netflix just for this.

843
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:15,225
Speaker 0: I would pay for Netflix for this and little which academia TV that I haven't watched yet.

844
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:15,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

845
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:20,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely but um, I Wouldn't buy Netflix just for this.

846
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:26,146
Speaker 0: but if you have a Netflix and this is probably worth your 80 minutes of your life You know, yeah

847
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,033
Speaker 1: and I why you're

848
00:54:27,073 --> 00:54:27,957
Speaker 0: eating dinner or something

849
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:33,664
Speaker 1: and it's go we literally watch it while we were eating dinner and I Will because they already got they already renewed they're gonna do.

850
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,629
Speaker 1: it's three parts.

851
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:39,244
Speaker 0: So three episode parts at the end of the fourth episode you're it's not.

852
00:54:39,264 --> 00:54:42,155
Speaker 0: the end is definitely like oh, okay There's a lot more to do.

853
00:54:42,256 --> 00:54:43,845
Speaker 0: It's almost like the first four episodes.

854
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:44,570
Speaker 0: is really the intro?

855
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,690
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it doesn't even get into the meat of anything.

856
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,146
Speaker 0: You don't even go to Dracula's castle, which is the most disappointing part because that's it's Castlevania.

857
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,190
Speaker 0: It's not Dracula Vanya.

858
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:54,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I want to see castle action.

859
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:56,710
Speaker 0: I care about the castle more than care about any of the characters.

860
00:54:57,352 --> 00:55:01,526
Speaker 1: I really I really want to see a la card bust out though because he had the best dialogue.

861
00:55:01,587 --> 00:55:07,550
Speaker 0: I think yeah I want to see them like go into like different rooms of the castle and fight all crazy different shit like a room with floating.

862
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,293
Speaker 0: But that's it.

863
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:16,750
Speaker 0: If it keeps up at this room with like some you know, all the different crazy bosses within the castle There are only eight more to see the mess with the Frankenstein monster.

864
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:21,130
Speaker 1: So eight episodes at this pace should be definitely be worth watching.

865
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:21,451
Speaker 0: I would.

866
00:55:21,471 --> 00:55:28,621
Speaker 0: if I were them what I would do is I'd have them get to the castle in one episode and then the remaining Episode should be monster of the week within the castle.

867
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:30,348
Speaker 0: and then the final episode Dracula.

868
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:31,772
Speaker 1: now They hinted.

869
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:43,687
Speaker 1: it appears that the first one they tried to just be like set up does the exact story of Castlevania 3 But they didn't commit to ending the way Castlevania 3 ends.

870
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:46,458
Speaker 0: Well, I mean Castlevania 3 ends.

871
00:55:46,498 --> 00:55:47,101
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

872
00:55:47,121 --> 00:55:47,683
Speaker 0: You were the winner.

873
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:48,687
Speaker 1: you killed Dracula.

874
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:49,250
Speaker 0: Good job.

875
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:50,618
Speaker 1: So maybe they will manage.

876
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:52,489
Speaker 1: maybe Dracula, but it'll actually end.

877
00:55:52,972 --> 00:56:04,710
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it'll end in such a way that gives you a nice Closing and leaves it open to there where they can make another series Either based on another one of the games or directly continuing from this and making up some new stuff.

878
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,200
Speaker 1: I would like to see them because I like this enough to where.

879
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:15,790
Speaker 1: as long as the next eight episodes are as good as this It'd be cool if they just started doing short vignette series like that from different eras.

880
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:19,797
Speaker 0: Do with Castlevania because you don't.

881
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:22,263
Speaker 0: Dracula's castle only appears once every whenever.

882
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:23,827
Speaker 0: yeah, so there isn't like.

883
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,614
Speaker 0: you don't have to follow Continuity.

884
00:56:25,634 --> 00:56:28,430
Speaker 0: you have to make the continuity be like the continuity.

885
00:56:28,711 --> 00:56:30,297
Speaker 1: You must have moto style continuity.

886
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:33,950
Speaker 0: There's so little connection between the different ones because there's so much time between them.

887
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:34,790
Speaker 0: It's like alright.

888
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:41,893
Speaker 0: well, it's a new person named Belmont and the only people that are still alive are like a la carte and Dracula and Dracula's castle appeared.

889
00:56:41,914 --> 00:56:42,516
Speaker 0: you have to kill him.

890
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:42,696
Speaker 0: There's.

891
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:46,670
Speaker 0: everything else is brand new every time and the castle changes every time.

892
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like alrighty, then I guess you don't need to.

893
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:53,153
Speaker 0: and it's like, you know, the vampire people are so old They don't remember.

894
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:55,846
Speaker 0: they don't have to bring up anything that happened in like a previous one.

895
00:56:55,907 --> 00:56:56,610
Speaker 0: It doesn't even matter.

896
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:59,449
Speaker 1: I feel like Simon's quest could actually turn into a really good one.

897
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:05,930
Speaker 0: Well, I think the problem with a lot of the first one and Simon's quest is that there's not a lot of characters.

898
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:14,642
Speaker 0: It's pretty much a Simon on a lonely man quest and really hard to turn the lonely person quest Into any sort of TV or movie.

899
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,010
Speaker 1: this one Castlevania 3 specifically has the team up.

900
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we know there's gonna be one more person on the team when they find grant.

901
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:26,310
Speaker 0: That's why it's hard to make like a Metroid movie because it's like, you know, and you make a movie like alien.

902
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:29,383
Speaker 0: You need to have all these people around Ripley to die.

903
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:30,949
Speaker 0: She doesn't just start out alone.

904
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,522
Speaker 1: Yep, Chris Castlevania 2 at least he goes town to town.

905
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:38,170
Speaker 1: It could be like every town has its problem.

906
00:57:38,391 --> 00:57:39,355
Speaker 0: Yes, you can do that.

907
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:42,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's gonna be you pick up friends.

908
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:43,110
Speaker 0: Can we leave up stuff?

909
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you could set it up to where he picks up friends and none of them make it to the next town.

910
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:46,990
Speaker 1: like hell.

911
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:53,930
Speaker 1: When he comes out of the north everyone everywhere he goes he picks people up in town and he's the only survivor at the next town.

912
00:57:54,412 --> 00:57:55,135
Speaker 1: That's how I'd do it.

913
00:57:55,698 --> 00:57:56,079
Speaker 0: Not bad.

914
00:57:56,622 --> 00:58:01,869
Speaker 1: But yeah, you know terrible nights curse having.

915
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,597
Speaker 1: But no this thing like it's really simple.

916
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:05,640
Speaker 1: It's really short.

917
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:06,904
Speaker 1: It's well done.

918
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,690
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the hell out of it.

919
00:58:09,556 --> 00:58:11,189
Speaker 1: I think my mom would actually really like it.

920
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:14,469
Speaker 0: My mom she I guess she didn't tell me turn it off.

921
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,870
Speaker 1: Who suggested that I watch vampire hunter D when I was a kid, my mom loves vampires more than you know.

922
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:21,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do.

923
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:24,327
Speaker 0: I only casually like enjoy a vampire because you know, I'm a nerd.

924
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:24,950
Speaker 0: I like a vampire.

925
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:26,538
Speaker 0: My mom loves a vampire shit.

926
00:58:26,558 --> 00:58:31,964
Speaker 1: She like and rice book reading, you know I read interview with the vampire and that's the only one that I read.

927
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,090
Speaker 0: I didn't even read that one.

928
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:34,418
Speaker 1: It was pretty good as a book.

929
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:35,444
Speaker 1: The movie was not great.

930
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:36,310
Speaker 1: The book is pretty good.

931
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,947
Speaker 0: I tried to read the actual problem.

932
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,107
Speaker 0: I tried to read the actual Dracula once and I only got like a few chapters in.

933
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:45,690
Speaker 0: yeah And then I read something else and then I forgot that I was reading Dracula.

934
00:58:46,312 --> 00:58:49,421
Speaker 1: But I mean this is what I like as a kid.

935
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:57,919
Speaker 1: if you'd shown this to me when I was in fourth grade I want to love the shit instead of vampire hunter D. Yeah, I would have been so obsessed with this you would.

936
00:58:57,939 --> 00:59:01,272
Speaker 1: I would have dressed up as Trevor Belmont in Halloween Like I would have gone.

937
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:02,697
Speaker 1: this would have been.

938
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:07,353
Speaker 0: the senator is definitely a younger Scott who fucking loved the shit out of like say Ninja scroll.

939
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:09,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, who now is a sort of like man and just girl.

940
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:21,370
Speaker 1: but vampire hunter D I still really enjoy even though come vampire hunter D unlike this Doesn't actually have a conflict because vampire hunter D is the story of oh, no, there's a problem.

941
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,774
Speaker 1: How will D surmount it?

942
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:24,841
Speaker 1: D wins because he's more powerful.

943
00:59:25,222 --> 00:59:26,967
Speaker 1: Oh, no, they trap D. What will he do?

944
00:59:26,987 --> 00:59:30,141
Speaker 1: Oh D is actually more powerful than you thought.

945
00:59:30,543 --> 00:59:32,050
Speaker 1: Oh, no, here comes Dracula himself.

946
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:35,600
Speaker 1: Oh D is actually more powerful than Dracula the end.

947
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:38,889
Speaker 1: I feel like there'll be actual conflict in this.
