1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,410
Speaker 0: It's Monday, October 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:09,971
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:13,756
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:16,840
Speaker 0: And this is a Spooky Geek Nights because it's October.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,420
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about web scraping.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,796
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,100
Speaker 0: So yeah, I ended up just circumstance between work and that bike trip that Emily and I planned.

8
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:40,900
Speaker 0: I basically took a month off of my normal life and I'm just now back from that honestly significant and extremely enjoyable pseudo-sabbatical.

9
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:45,780
Speaker 0: That's the longest I've taken off of normal life stuff in a long, long time.

10
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:51,980
Speaker 1: My job is still pretty new, but I don't work on Fridays so there's no complaints to be had.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,325
Speaker 1: But, you know, I stayed here.

12
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:58,560
Speaker 1: I lived a life that had a lot of free time thanks to not podcasting.

13
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:03,020
Speaker 1: And I did work on the Geek Nights website a significant amount.

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,080
Speaker 1: Not done, but we're moving.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,387
Speaker 0: I lived a life of significant free time partly because... So I'll talk about this later.

16
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,240
Speaker 0: Emily and I are going to do a special episode.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,980
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about the entire 481 mile bike trip we did across New York State.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,030
Speaker 0: But the TL;DR version is, it's fucking awesome.

19
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,038
Speaker 0: It's not as hard as people think it is.

20
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:32,119
Speaker 0: I highly recommend doing something like that at some point in your life if you enjoy cycling and are capable of this.

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,400
Speaker 1: I've said it many times, but you know car culture, people just driving everywhere their whole life and not walking much and definitely not biking much.

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,540
Speaker 1: You know, people have this idea of cycling as like a difficult athletic activity.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,914
Speaker 0: No, it was just every day, just all day, wee, seeing stuff.

24
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,300
Speaker 1: I never thought I saw the whole state.

25
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:57,540
Speaker 1: It's like if you're not racing a bike, you can go really far, much faster than you realize.

26
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,820
Speaker 0: You think we were huffing and puffing?

27
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:01,780
Speaker 1: It's really efficient.

28
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,367
Speaker 0: I like to huff and puff.

29
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,420
Speaker 0: That's where Scott and I disagree on enjoying biking.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,990
Speaker 0: However, I don't huff and puff for 70 miles.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,933
Speaker 0: I'm going to 70 miles.

32
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,220
Speaker 0: I'm going like 10 miles an hour, just chill times.

33
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:22,200
Speaker 1: You can get on a bicycle, no matter what kind of body you have, if your body is capable of bicycling, you can get to 10 miles an hour.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,680
Speaker 0: And if your legs don't work for that purpose, there are hand crank bikes, the bikes that are actually super efficient.

35
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,950
Speaker 1: Some bicycle type machine can work for your body, most likely.

36
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:43,335
Speaker 1: You can go 10 miles an hour, most likely, and at 10 miles an hour, you can go 60 miles in 6 hours.

37
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,968
Speaker 1: And that's pretty damn far.

38
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:49,510
Speaker 1: You can get places.

39
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:04,019
Speaker 0: So then I went to London right after that, so literally we finished the bike trip, took an Amtrak sleeper car home because that one line on Amtrak, you can take bikes on it now for 20 bucks.

40
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:09,460
Speaker 0: You don't have to take the bike apart, you just bring it to the baggage area, they put it on the train, they take it off.

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,386
Speaker 0: It was easy, it was great.

42
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:13,895
Speaker 0: Not every Amtrak train has that.

43
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:15,120
Speaker 0: You have to do a lot of research.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,799
Speaker 1: A lot of people have had some hassles, so maybe I guess just that line is handling it nicely.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,800
Speaker 0: So if you look at the Amtrak website, there's like 5 different ways a train could handle bikes that are all crazy different.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,958
Speaker 1: Based on what equipment is, yeah.

47
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:40,220
Speaker 0: And you have to look up your specific train number, and then look up the day you're going, and then you can figure out which of the 5 ways might be applicable, and then you probably still have to call someone to make sure.

48
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:46,859
Speaker 1: You can't search for the train based on that, like you can't say "I want the nice bike train, show me only trains that have

49
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,000
Speaker 1: that.".

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:56,860
Speaker 0: You can search for trains that allow bikes, however, most of those are, yeah, you can bring a bike if you turn the handlebars sideways and take the pedals off and put it in a bike box.

51
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:57,899
Speaker 0: Yeah.

52
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,020
Speaker 0: Which sucks, because for those of you who aren't bike people, that's really easy to do on a cheap bike.

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:09,159
Speaker 0: But if you have a carbon fiber fork, even if you know bikes, I do not recommend doing that without a professional doing it for you.

54
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,182
Speaker 1: Eh.

55
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:15,160
Speaker 0: Do you have the appropriate tools to get the torque exactly right?

56
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:17,259
Speaker 1: To take the pedals off?

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,560
Speaker 0: No, no, to twist your handlebars 90 degrees from the fork.

58
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,049
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, you could just take your handlebars off.

59
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:29,638
Speaker 0: Uh, no, I guess you could.

60
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:33,070
Speaker 0: The Amtrak site requires you to turn the fork sideways into a thing.

61
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,569
Speaker 0: They have a bunch of diagrams and even videos that'll help you.

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,210
Speaker 1: Alright, well I haven't seen it, but, you know, taking your handlebars on and off is pretty easy.

63
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:49,310
Speaker 1: The only issue is if you really want to rotate the front wheel to be perpendicular to the frame, you could take the front wheel off.

64
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,246
Speaker 1: It's like that's easy to do also, right?

65
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:57,950
Speaker 0: The other thing is bike boxes are weirdly expensive and they're pretty much one-time use.

66
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, professional cycling people don't do that.

67
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:05,050
Speaker 1: They get on a plane and they get to the other end and then there's more bikes.

68
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,430
Speaker 0: Even bike touring people, because we met a ton of people on the trip who did long bike touring.

69
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,510
Speaker 0: We met the Scottish couple who were biking the same route we were doing in the opposite direction.

70
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,829
Speaker 0: And we were like, "Oh yeah, so what'd you do with the

71
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:16,970
Speaker 0: bikes?".

72
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,470
Speaker 0: And we were just like, "Oh, we just bought bikes, we came here, we picked them up at a bike shop in Buffalo, and we're going to give them away to a charity when we get to the end.

73
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:25,003
Speaker 0: That was cheaper than shipping our

74
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:25,285
Speaker 0: bikes.".

75
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:26,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

76
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

77
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:32,750
Speaker 0: So then I went to London for a big work thing, and then I went to Frankfurt where all my engineers were.

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,750
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, I'll talk about the trip later, maybe I'll do a special on the Patriot or something.

79
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:43,970
Speaker 0: It was great, but I always had this impression that Frankfurt is a boring city.

80
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:53,626
Speaker 0: Because everyone I know who travels broadly, who has spent a lot of time in Germany, has been telling me my entire adult life, "Frankfurt's the boring city.

81
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,688
Speaker 0: Why do you go to Frankfurt?

82
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,329
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah, blah,

83
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:55,610
Speaker 0: blah.".

84
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,350
Speaker 0: They always tell me some other city's great.

85
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:01,210
Speaker 0: And I believed them, partly because I had only been to Frankfurt once.

86
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,510
Speaker 0: And that one time I was there, it was kind of just boring.

87
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,530
Speaker 0: Like Cleveland-y, but like nice Cleveland.

88
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,710
Speaker 0: Like if Cleveland were nice, but it was still Cleveland.

89
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:18,350
Speaker 0: So having spent a weekend there, between work, where I had nothing to do but just go explore, I now have a hypothesis.

90
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,590
Speaker 0: Frankfurt is not boring.

91
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:33,130
Speaker 0: The people who say Frankfurt is boring are themselves either boring or unimaginative, or expect the kinds of entertainment from a city that people like me and Scott do not seek out.

92
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:36,430
Speaker 0: And in fact, I think Scott would also very much enjoy Frankfurt.

93
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:44,349
Speaker 0: So yeah, full disclosure though, that might be colored by the fact that I was staying in a five-star hotel the entire time.

94
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,930
Speaker 1: I mean, you can stay at a five-star hotel in a, you know, a trash fire and be okay.

95
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,381
Speaker 0: True.

96
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,981
Speaker 0: Shall I warm those crack pipe?

97
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,710
Speaker 0: It was very much that kind of hotel.

98
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,049
Speaker 0: But it was a real good trip.

99
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:58,196
Speaker 0: And we're back.

100
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:00,650
Speaker 0: I don't foresee any major disruptions to gig nights.

101
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,390
Speaker 0: We will have regularly scheduled disruptions now.

102
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,770
Speaker 1: I mean, I foresee several major US holidays in the near future.

103
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:13,250
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, we'll get the regularly scheduled disruptions like the November, December time, the important hockey game time.

104
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, all that shit's coming down.

105
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,750
Speaker 1: All right, so I got a normal old opening bit.

106
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,310
Speaker 1: So on Friday night, just a few days ago, right?

107
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,129
Speaker 1: I'm in my apartment doing my Friday night biz, you know, I didn't work all day.

108
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:31,050
Speaker 1: And I hear noises outside, like you do when you live in the city and there's a street right out your window.

109
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,710
Speaker 1: Occasionally you hear noises outside because there's a street there.

110
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,309
Speaker 1: It could be anything going on out there.

111
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:36,582
Speaker 1: Right.

112
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,950
Speaker 1: Even when my previous apartment where the street that my apartment faced was like basically an alley, like not a busy street.

113
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:45,869
Speaker 1: Things happened out there.

114
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:52,690
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, living at the base of a bridge next to a subway station and the approach to a major non-toll bridge.

115
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, shit happens outside our apartment.

116
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,830
Speaker 1: Things happen outside the window.

117
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:57,649
Speaker 1: It's a thing.

118
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,010
Speaker 1: So whenever I hear noises outside the window that sound out of the ordinary.

119
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:02,630
Speaker 1: Right.

120
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,088
Speaker 1: I will go and take a look.

121
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:09,810
Speaker 1: Mostly not because I'm going to call the cops on someone unless there's something, you know, really heinous.

122
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,710
Speaker 1: But in case there is an emergency.

123
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,902
Speaker 1: Right.

124
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:21,570
Speaker 1: It's like there could be noises outside because of a fire or somebody passing out in the street or a new weird thing is happening.

125
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,850
Speaker 0: And now you recognize if you hear that sound again.

126
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:24,147
Speaker 0: All right.

127
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:24,909
Speaker 0: It's that weird thing.

128
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:25,789
Speaker 0: Now I know about it.

129
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,089
Speaker 0: I don't need to go look a second time.

130
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,645
Speaker 1: I need to call a different emergency service.

131
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:30,349
Speaker 1: that's not police.

132
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,407
Speaker 0: Maybe call the news.

133
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,150
Speaker 0: Maybe you start videoing it like.

134
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:33,904
Speaker 1: Yeah.

135
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,110
Speaker 1: Who knows what's going on out there?

136
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:36,610
Speaker 1: Usually, you know, whatever.

137
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,028
Speaker 1: So I go out and I see.

138
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:38,929
Speaker 1: Right.

139
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,310
Speaker 1: A car that is a parked in quotation marks.

140
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:44,710
Speaker 1: Right.

141
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,670
Speaker 1: It's supposed to be parallel parking, but this car is like diagonal.

142
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,330
Speaker 1: Forty five degrees aiming at the sidewalk.

143
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:51,949
Speaker 1: Right.

144
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:57,269
Speaker 1: And the driver's side door is open, completely open.

145
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,410
Speaker 0: Oh, that someone jumped out of a car that they just stopped really quickly.

146
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:02,487
Speaker 0: Hold on.

147
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,230
Speaker 1: And someone is moving about this car.

148
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,807
Speaker 1: Right.

149
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,970
Speaker 1: I think they have a bag and there is some amount of yelling that was indecipherable.

150
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,130
Speaker 0: Now this reeks of Uber drive gone wrong.

151
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:16,706
Speaker 1: I don't know.

152
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:17,948
Speaker 0: I'm just speculating.

153
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,710
Speaker 0: I'm the comment.

154
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:22,110
Speaker 1: I can't tell what this is, what kind of individual this was.

155
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,410
Speaker 1: Other than that, it was a person who was yelling and clearly an altercation ish manner.

156
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:29,628
Speaker 1: But I didn't see any other people.

157
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:31,133
Speaker 1: Ah, they were.

158
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:31,675
Speaker 1: they were.

159
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,730
Speaker 1: they were in and out of the car, I guess the side of the car.

160
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:36,121
Speaker 0: I don't know.

161
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,695
Speaker 1: But they then went.

162
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,277
Speaker 1: they went.

163
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:43,528
Speaker 1: they walked away from the car in a direction down the street.

164
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:44,950
Speaker 1: Right.

165
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,870
Speaker 1: Yelling something.

166
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:47,550
Speaker 1: Then there was no more yelling.

167
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,709
Speaker 1: There was no more person.

168
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,248
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,666
Speaker 1: There was just this car sitting there parked diagonally when it should have been parked parallely.

170
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,309
Speaker 1: Right.

171
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:00,850
Speaker 1: Ah, with the driver's side door wide open, just sitting there off.

172
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:01,630
Speaker 1: Right.

173
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,888
Speaker 1: Just a car sitting there.

174
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:12,028
Speaker 1: And I saw delivery people, cyclists, walkers, all kinds of people going past the car, not even being curious as to why the door was open.

175
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:14,950
Speaker 0: I'm slightly curious.

176
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,690
Speaker 0: I might have looked in as I walk.

177
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:17,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

178
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:18,930
Speaker 1: That's what I would have done.

179
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,890
Speaker 1: Looked in, make sure there isn't like an unconscious person in the car.

180
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:22,869
Speaker 1: Who knows what.

181
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:23,684
Speaker 1: Yeah.

182
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:25,929
Speaker 1: I didn't go down there.

183
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:27,349
Speaker 1: I waited.

184
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:32,330
Speaker 0: How much would it take to go downstairs for something we see outside our windows?

185
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,530
Speaker 1: If I saw like a hand, like of a struggling person coming out the door.

186
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:41,310
Speaker 0: Or like a series of clowns started emerging from the car.

187
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,788
Speaker 0: Like I would go down and see what's going on.

188
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:43,641
Speaker 1: Right.

189
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,509
Speaker 1: Something like that.

190
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,030
Speaker 0: It had to be at least like four clowns before I bothered, though.

191
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,650
Speaker 1: The car was sitting there a while, just abandoned effectively with the door open.

192
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,090
Speaker 1: The next day, I didn't I didn't check on it again.

193
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,549
Speaker 1: I just waited like five minutes and I was like, well, OK.

194
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,647
Speaker 0: And then I see the pro move anonymous account post to Reddit free car.

195
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:08,629
Speaker 1: I had the next day walking down the street and I noticed the car is still there with the door closed.

196
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,769
Speaker 1: Someone at some point in the night Friday night had closed the door of the car.

197
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:14,370
Speaker 0: All right.

198
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,590
Speaker 0: Good Samaritan, probably.

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,710
Speaker 1: The car is still here Monday night.

200
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,650
Speaker 1: The car is still parked diagonally in that spot.

201
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,468
Speaker 0: You got to put a webcam at this thing and make a Reddit post countdown to whatever's up with this car.

202
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,770
Speaker 1: This car is going to amass some tickets parked in a very much well today.

203
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:35,629
Speaker 1: See, they were lucky.

204
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,329
Speaker 1: Today was, you know, indigenous people's day.

205
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,090
Speaker 1: So they did not have an open school today.

206
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,883
Speaker 1: It's because the one time I had a parking like right in front of the entrance to the high school.

207
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:46,028
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,330
Speaker 0: If you don't live in New York, like I don't think you understand the parking ticket situation in this city.

209
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:55,610
Speaker 0: If you park a car illegally and like blink, there will be a ticket on that car.

210
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,470
Speaker 1: As soon as school starts, that car will be parked illegally and will amass tickets.

211
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:02,849
Speaker 1: And it's not going to move.

212
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:06,510
Speaker 1: I'm certain it isn't an abandoned vehicle for some reason.

213
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,268
Speaker 1: It has license plates that I didn't look up.

214
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,038
Speaker 1: But when?

215
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:13,610
Speaker 1: how many tickets will it amass?

216
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,609
Speaker 0: How quickly before it is to see a webcam and a betting pool is the way to go with this.

217
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,227
Speaker 1: It's it's just a very interesting situation.

218
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,710
Speaker 1: Like, how did the car get there?

219
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,297
Speaker 1: Whose is it?

220
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,350
Speaker 1: Why did they abandon it?

221
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,916
Speaker 1: How did they?

222
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:27,048
Speaker 1: how did this come to be?

223
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,889
Speaker 1: What was the altercation about?

224
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,750
Speaker 0: See, forget true crime.

225
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:39,169
Speaker 0: I want a genre of investigative reporters figuring out the really low key mundane shit that happens around in cities like New York.

226
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:40,810
Speaker 1: You know, it's a mystery, right?

227
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,210
Speaker 1: Mysteries are interesting.

228
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,149
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a reason all those teenagers are driving around.

229
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,290
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to be a mystery about who murdered someone or who stole a painting or who did some international spy crime.

230
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:55,230
Speaker 1: It could be a mystery of a normal everyday thing that might not even be a crime.

231
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,790
Speaker 1: Well, then the parking violation is a crime.

232
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,430
Speaker 0: I mean, those teenagers drive around in that mystery mobile looking for nonsense.

233
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,050
Speaker 0: Every kid has the mysteries of the neighborhood.

234
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,608
Speaker 0: Like, what's up with that one weird house?

235
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,686
Speaker 1: Yeah.

236
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,509
Speaker 0: So there is a ton of news.

237
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:12,650
Speaker 0: Not going to talk about everything.

238
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,389
Speaker 0: It's not time for a tech news roundup just yet.

239
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,729
Speaker 0: But edging into an opening bit.

240
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:26,487
Speaker 0: So while I was away, you know, right before I went off, Verizon started upgrading the network to support IPv6.

241
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,690
Speaker 1: First of all, first of all, they didn't announce that they were doing this, right?

242
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,235
Speaker 0: There was.

243
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:38,330
Speaker 0: So there were press releases that were not picked up by anyone because no one gives a shit.

244
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,250
Speaker 1: Right.

245
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,630
Speaker 1: But basically, I knew because I checked my router that IPv6 was not working.

246
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:51,010
Speaker 1: And what happened, I saw a message on the community discussion board, the local geographic community neighborhood discussion board.

247
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,230
Speaker 1: Like, hey, was Fios out last night?

248
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:00,070
Speaker 1: And everyone's like, yes, everybody knows that everyone in the whole neighborhood agreed that Fios was out last night while I was asleep.

249
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,750
Speaker 1: Not out of last night, but the night when we had the discussion, my five, one person in the comment thread says yes.

250
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:08,710
Speaker 1: And now IPv6 is enabled.

251
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,610
Speaker 1: And I checked my router and sure enough, IPv6 was now enabled for real.

252
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,150
Speaker 1: Not like in the olden days where you could do a weird thing to get a bridge or something like this.

253
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,669
Speaker 0: I had an account on the six bone that dates me.

254
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:22,712
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:28,490
Speaker 1: We now have for real IPv6 in our neighborhood with our Internet service provider.

256
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:33,150
Speaker 0: So they did not upgrade our neighborhood at that time because our files was fine.

257
00:14:35,812 --> 00:14:37,948
Speaker 1: So they updated yours and mine at the same time.

258
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:42,849
Speaker 0: Because we did not experience the problem that I experienced at that time.

259
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,260
Speaker 1: The time that you experienced.

260
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,930
Speaker 1: the problem is the time that we got upgraded.

261
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:51,090
Speaker 0: No, we didn't experience the problem until while I was in Frankfurt.

262
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:53,069
Speaker 1: That's when that happened, yes.

263
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,767
Speaker 0: What date was it?

264
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,429
Speaker 1: I'll have to look it up.

265
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,130
Speaker 0: Because I want to say I was in London when that happened and our Internet was probably was still fine.

266
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:01,908
Speaker 1: Let me let me look it up.

267
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:03,130
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

268
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,730
Speaker 1: It could have been that, like, you know, your router didn't restart or something.

269
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could have been like it doesn't get enabled until they push it out to the router.

270
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:10,310
Speaker 0: Who knows?

271
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,491
Speaker 0: Regardless, so 14 days ago, 14 days ago, I was still in London.

272
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:22,980
Speaker 1: OK, well, that's the day that it happened.

273
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,402
Speaker 0: All right.

274
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:28,560
Speaker 0: So about a week later, the Internet in our house gets just shitty.

275
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,280
Speaker 0: So I come home from the trip and the Internet still shitty.

276
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,819
Speaker 0: So start to investigate a little bit.

277
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:37,200
Speaker 0: And what I find download working fine.

278
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,480
Speaker 0: I can download at one hundred, two hundred megabits per second from anywhere.

279
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,656
Speaker 0: I tested all over the network.

280
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:44,200
Speaker 0: Everything's fine.

281
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,163
Speaker 0: Upload.

282
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,494
Speaker 0: I was getting maybe 50K up.

283
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:49,919
Speaker 1: Yep.

284
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:54,277
Speaker 1: So, yeah, the problems that Rym experienced, I experienced 14 days ago.

285
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,401
Speaker 1: Yep.

286
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:57,471
Speaker 0: So I do a little investigating.

287
00:15:58,215 --> 00:15:59,159
Speaker 0: I know network stuff.

288
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,419
Speaker 1: Even though I already posted the answer.

289
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,221
Speaker 0: Yep.

290
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,980
Speaker 0: But I did not read that because I had been in Germany.

291
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:07,039
Speaker 0: I was barely paying attention to stuff.

292
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,999
Speaker 0: So I poke around a little bit.

293
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:13,639
Speaker 0: I do a test from the actual Verizon box and there's no problems there.

294
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:17,800
Speaker 0: Then I do a test with one of my wireless devices and it's fine.

295
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,840
Speaker 1: No problems there either.

296
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,204
Speaker 1: Nope.

297
00:16:19,487 --> 00:16:20,418
Speaker 1: That'll be working fine.

298
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:20,540
Speaker 1: Yep.

299
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:26,500
Speaker 0: So then I do some packet captures, of course, just to see, like, is there anything going on my own network?

300
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,800
Speaker 0: Before I open it, take it with Verizon, look at my own network, make sure that I'm not having a problem.

301
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:38,060
Speaker 0: And what I suspected was that there is a switch that every wired device in our apartment is plugged into.

302
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,340
Speaker 0: That is very, very, very old and cheap.

303
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,459
Speaker 0: I suspected that maybe something went on with it.

304
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:47,429
Speaker 1: I can see why you would think that.

305
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:48,716
Speaker 1: The common factor.

306
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,580
Speaker 0: And that switch was very hot, but I didn't remember if it had always been hot because I had not touched it physically in years.

307
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,940
Speaker 0: So I unplug my computer from that switch and I plug it directly into the Verizon router.

308
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,148
Speaker 0: Same problem.

309
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,138
Speaker 0: That eliminates that.

310
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,973
Speaker 0: And I do a packet capture and I see, like, 95% packet loss.

311
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:19,540
Speaker 0: And I also see that the checksums on all the packets going in one direction are fucked up.

312
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,079
Speaker 0: And there's this extra, like, there's this blobs of nonsense.

313
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,960
Speaker 0: Emily described them as, what, data dingleberries hanging out after the checksums on these TCP packets.

314
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,528
Speaker 0: And then I put two and two together.

315
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,700
Speaker 0: Scott reminded me about the IPv6 thing.

316
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,072
Speaker 0: Sure enough, I see IPv6 is enabled.

317
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:39,340
Speaker 0: I see this is happening.

318
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,872
Speaker 0: I disable IPv6 in my network as a quick test.

319
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,400
Speaker 0: All problems disappear.

320
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,124
Speaker 0: That is the exact problem.

321
00:17:45,144 --> 00:18:07,080
Speaker 0: And the problem is a bug in Intel gigabit ethernet controllers, coupled with technically correct but not advisable behavior in the ONTs, which are like the optical connectors that Fios and networks like it use to connect your internal non-fiber network to their fiber network.

322
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:18,980
Speaker 0: Not bad, because it's not incorrect, but weird and inadvisable behavior of the ONTs triggered a bug in these specific network cards.

323
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:20,666
Speaker 1: Well, not specific.

324
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,380
Speaker 1: It's actually extremely widespread.

325
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,900
Speaker 0: Well, because it's Intel and nobody buys network cards anymore.

326
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,521
Speaker 1: Right.

327
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:40,380
Speaker 1: A very, very, very large number of Intel network cards, wired ethernet network cards, especially the kinds that you'll see on like, you know, desktop motherboards like, you know, aces, whatever motherboard you have, you nerd.

328
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,903
Speaker 1: You have a computer, right?

329
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:48,240
Speaker 1: Almost all of those cards up until a few years ago have a bug in the hardware.

330
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:52,234
Speaker 1: It cannot be fixed by a firmware update or a driver or anything like that.

331
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,178
Speaker 1: There's no fix for it.

332
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,840
Speaker 1: Where if there are IPv6 packets that have data after the checksum, which is technically acceptable, I guess.

333
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:09,600
Speaker 0: I did not read the RFC, but this is one of those situations where RFCs will use language like must and must not.

334
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:12,978
Speaker 0: But then they'll say things like should and should not.

335
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,580
Speaker 1: I don't know what the actual thing is, but it's not any legal thing, right?

336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,820
Speaker 1: Because Intel actually changed their more recent network cards to not be broken, right?

337
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,245
Speaker 1: So they're definitely the wrong.

338
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:27,040
Speaker 1: They were, you know, but basically all these Intel network cards are wrong.

339
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:37,300
Speaker 1: And you have to go into your device manager in Windows and disable this one feature, the TCP checksum offload feature.

340
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:51,560
Speaker 1: And if you disable that, what will end up happening is instead of your network cards hardware, right, checking the checksums on all the TCP packets to verify that the packets are correct, your CPU will do the work instead.

341
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,680
Speaker 1: Which it's such a light load for a modern computer, you will not notice.

342
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:02,220
Speaker 1: It would be nice if you were able to keep the feature on just because technically you have this hardware that could do it.

343
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,330
Speaker 1: Why should the CPU do extra work?

344
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,220
Speaker 1: But turning it off, you'll never notice.

345
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:11,940
Speaker 1: And it fixes the problem because Windows TCP stack will handle it properly.

346
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,820
Speaker 0: It could theoretically cause a likely negligible performance.

347
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:17,500
Speaker 1: You will never notice.

348
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:26,260
Speaker 1: The other thing is you could just buy another network card that doesn't have a broken chip in it and use that and not use the one on your motherboard.

349
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:35,660
Speaker 0: And you will only experience this if you connect to an internet service provider that uses fiber like Fios does, but they're not the only one.

350
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,306
Speaker 0: And they use a particular kind of ONT.

351
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:48,940
Speaker 0: And I got a note, multiple providers, I haven't seen anything about Verizon, but like Alcatel and some other providers are currently upgrading their ONTs to not do this behavior anymore.

352
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:51,363
Speaker 0: OK.

353
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:58,580
Speaker 1: But yeah, Verizon, it's like Verizon just upgraded to IPv6, right, without notifying the customers.

354
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,727
Speaker 0: And imagine if you're not technical.

355
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,198
Speaker 0: Your internet just fucking stopped working.

356
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,040
Speaker 1: Well, if you're not technical, do you really have a wired ethernet at this point?

357
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,100
Speaker 1: But if you're not, a lot of people might have like a gaming PC out there on Fios.

358
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,069
Speaker 1: They got it plugged in with ethernet.

359
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,957
Speaker 1: Suddenly, like YouTube just doesn't work.

360
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:15,520
Speaker 1: Right.

361
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,665
Speaker 1: And they're like, what the fuck is like?

362
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,979
Speaker 1: only websites that are using IPv6 are going to start fucking up.

363
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:23,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they're only doing this on the IPv6 packets.

364
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,336
Speaker 1: So and that's like old IPv4 website dot com.

365
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:28,300
Speaker 1: It's going to work even funnier.

366
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,471
Speaker 0: So the Ookala speed test uses IPv6.

367
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,535
Speaker 0: So we had the problem.

368
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,760
Speaker 0: None of the other speed test dudes.

369
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,965
Speaker 0: They all showed no problems.

370
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:35,910
Speaker 1: Yep.

371
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,140
Speaker 0: That's why I went straight to the packet capture.

372
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:45,800
Speaker 0: So my advice to you as a nerd to make this lesson completely useless, unless you work in interesting industries.

373
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,379
Speaker 0: Number one, if there's ever a weird problem.

374
00:21:49,881 --> 00:21:56,200
Speaker 0: Look for the parts of the specification that are shoulds and should nots as opposed to musts and must nots.

375
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,380
Speaker 0: Therein lie all weird problems.

376
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:10,260
Speaker 1: Part of the reason the website is taking so long is because I'm a person who will obey all the should and should nots of everything, even if it's completely useless and will never be relevant for the actual functionality.

377
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,886
Speaker 0: This applies to everything.

378
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:15,960
Speaker 0: My day job, the fixed protocol, you know, all that nonsense in capital markets.

379
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,761
Speaker 0: Guess what?

380
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:23,220
Speaker 0: You know, one of the most common causes of a problem there is when someone sends a message encoded in the fixed protocol.

381
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:28,020
Speaker 0: That is technically correct, but kind of weird and nobody does it that way.

382
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,040
Speaker 1: Yep.

383
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,600
Speaker 0: If some of you internalize that lesson, you can make six figures working in capital markets within a week.

384
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:35,640
Speaker 1: Maybe.

385
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,040
Speaker 0: So in some other news, goes through some really quick news.

386
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,300
Speaker 0: So a Dutch court, this will not help usians too much, not yet anyway.

387
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:51,920
Speaker 0: They have made a very specific ruling that is kind of important because the US does not have these protections.

388
00:22:52,441 --> 00:23:05,779
Speaker 0: A company in Florida basically tried to fire an employee of theirs who works in the Netherlands because they required him to turn on his webcam all day while he was at work in case they wanted to monitor him.

389
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:08,800
Speaker 0: While he was working from home, working remotely.

390
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,647
Speaker 0: He said, "That's

391
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:11,170
Speaker 0: creepy."

392
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:12,940
Speaker 0: And he turned off his webcam.

393
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,340
Speaker 0: They fired him, citing that he refused to work and was insubordinate.

394
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:21,477
Speaker 0: And the Dutch courts ruled, "Nope, that is an unreasonable request.

395
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:21,939
Speaker 0: Fuck

396
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:22,120
Speaker 0: you.".

397
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,040
Speaker 0: And they made the company reinstate him and pay a fine.

398
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:25,722
Speaker 1: Okay.

399
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:31,940
Speaker 1: Or I guess the alternative is the company could have ceased operations in the Dutch lands.

400
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know all the details of exactly that.

401
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:39,556
Speaker 0: I do not know how those types of jurisdictional matters work out in the end.

402
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:40,500
Speaker 0: I am not a lawyer.

403
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:46,240
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that if you just got the USBC thing going on, right?

404
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:53,120
Speaker 1: If Apple just didn't sell any iPhones or any Apple products in Europe then the EU couldn't force them to do USBC.

405
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:54,587
Speaker 1: It's pretty clear, right?

406
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 1: So if this company only hires people...

407
00:23:58,441 --> 00:24:10,238
Speaker 0: If you're in Europe and you go to a lot of low tier websites, they won't load and they'll basically tell you, "Oh, Europe is evil and GDPR and we can't comply with it so you can't access this website from

408
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:10,539
Speaker 0: Europe.".

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,556
Speaker 0: Even though the reality is more, "Yeah, we're trying to spy on you and Europe actually made laws against

410
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:16,797
Speaker 0: this.".

411
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:24,420
Speaker 0: But this is actually something... I have not encountered this, but I saw this article.

412
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:35,560
Speaker 1: People only get away with abusing employees like this when they're doing jobs that are considered but incorrectly considered.

413
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,657
Speaker 1: No skill, low skill, menial jobs.

414
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,320
Speaker 0: But even in technology, a lot of help desk work, a lot of people who serve as customer tickets, this kind of stuff is happening.

415
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,520
Speaker 0: A lot of teachers get these kinds of requirements.

416
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:53,020
Speaker 0: Remote workers in low tier industries or industries that are trying to prevent people from working from home.

417
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,980
Speaker 0: Students in high schools who are doing remote classes are being forced to do this kind of thing when they take tests.

418
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,920
Speaker 0: It's like they'll get in trouble if they look away from the monitor for too long taking a test.

419
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,380
Speaker 0: It is evil and egregious and it's only going to get worse until we pass some laws.

420
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,631
Speaker 0: So keep an eye on this space and if you live and work in the U.S.

421
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:24,280
Speaker 0: and a company does this, maybe talk to a lawyer, but you're probably screwed and you will probably lose because I don't think you would have the resources to fight the companies that are doing this kind of evil nonsense.

422
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:25,880
Speaker 1: Unless you've got a union.

423
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where I was going with this.

424
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,220
Speaker 0: The only way to fight worker exploitation in a country like America is to form and join a union.

425
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:39,320
Speaker 1: Alright, so kind of biggish news.

426
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,120
Speaker 1: Nvidia announced the 4090, which will cost like a fortune, small, you know, whatever.

427
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:58,740
Speaker 0: I guess I could almost thank the shitty crypto people who made it too hard to buy a 3080 when I wanted a 3080 because they made me wait so long that now I can just skip it and go straight to the 4080.

428
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,309
Speaker 1: Alright, so I mean what is there to say about the 4090?

429
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,180
Speaker 1: I mean it's pretty much what you expected.

430
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,779
Speaker 1: It's enormous, right?

431
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,839
Speaker 0: It's what, like three slots wide?

432
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's going to be really hot and use a lot of electricity, right?

433
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,600
Speaker 1: You know, Nvidia is basically the opposite of Apple.

434
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:20,580
Speaker 1: Apple's like, look, we're going to make the CPU as fast as we can, but also we're going to concentrate on energy efficiency, right?

435
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,180
Speaker 1: Intel's like, we want to do that, but we're not as good at it because we're having, you know, issues, right?

436
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:29,739
Speaker 1: We're a little dysfunctional for the past several years, right?

437
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:41,460
Speaker 1: And Nvidia's like, fuck that shit, we'll just use as much electricity and generate as much heat as we can and compensate with cooling and we'll make the fastest thing, you know, known to anyone.

438
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:46,019
Speaker 1: And Nvidia thing ends up being the fastest.

439
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,401
Speaker 1: Like a drag car is the fastest, but... Also

440
00:26:50,441 --> 00:27:02,140
Speaker 0: because there really aren't other credible video cards and while a few of you, including some people we know, are already butt AMD, I got to point out that every single fucking time we play online games,

441
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:03,362
Speaker 1: the

442
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:10,200
Speaker 0: two people who have AMD video cards have problems, have crashes, have issues that nobody else runs into.

443
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,338
Speaker 0: That has been the story my entire life and it is still true.

444
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:17,953
Speaker 1: So anyway, what is up with the 4090?

445
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:19,560
Speaker 1: It's like, why would you get one, right?

446
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:32,760
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if you really are a person who is playing, you know, competitive, real time, high resolution, fancy 3D top of the line games, Even then, a 3070 can play those games.

447
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,307
Speaker 1: It's like a 4090 would be like overkill.

448
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:39,740
Speaker 1: Maybe you just, you really want to prepare for the next game and not have to buy another video card for a long time.

449
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:48,616
Speaker 0: Even if you are doing non-consumer, like professional high spec VR, like research nonsense, a 3080 Ti is enough.

450
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,681
Speaker 1: Yup.

451
00:27:52,823 --> 00:27:59,338
Speaker 1: I guess if you're making those kinds of games or you're doing some other 3D graphics work, right?

452
00:27:59,539 --> 00:27:59,959
Speaker 1: I don't know.

453
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,612
Speaker 1: You know, you're a researcher or something.

454
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:03,639
Speaker 1: I don't know.

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:12,640
Speaker 0: The use cases I can see for a 4090 right now are if you're doing AI research, this is actually something you can use to power AI pretty directly.

456
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:15,499
Speaker 0: That's one of the most common uses of these things.

457
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:25,860
Speaker 0: This would be useful if you were doing high spec VR and wanted to live stream it and you didn't need an external computer to do it.

458
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,244
Speaker 0: Like, I guess that's one use case.

459
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:32,900
Speaker 0: Or if you are making and rendering extremely advanced VFX, you could use this.

460
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:44,839
Speaker 1: So one interesting thing that they did is they have this sort of like RTX real time ray tracing.

461
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:45,520
Speaker 1: they've been pushing.

462
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:51,187
Speaker 1: And on the one hand, it's sort of a chicken and egg scenario.

463
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,533
Speaker 1: It's like, who the hell has a ray tracing card?

464
00:28:59,303 --> 00:28:59,545
Speaker 1: Right.

465
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:01,199
Speaker 1: Almost only really wealthy people.

466
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:10,860
Speaker 1: So if you're a game developer, why the fuck would you spend the time to add that feature to your game just to get a few sales from people who have these cards?

467
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,281
Speaker 0: Counterpoint.

468
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,604
Speaker 0: Remember GLQuake?

469
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:18,960
Speaker 0: When GLQuake was announced, there were like 12 people in America who could play GLQuake on a computer.

470
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,076
Speaker 1: Sure.

471
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,338
Speaker 0: They made it anyway to push the industry forward.

472
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:25,766
Speaker 1: Still, it's a little bit of chicken and egg, right?

473
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:30,440
Speaker 1: Are you going to develop a game that requires RTX or has RTX mode?

474
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,659
Speaker 1: And how much effort is it going to take to add that mode versus how many extra sales will that get you?

475
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,880
Speaker 1: So Nvidia is selling this technology and gamers are like, OK, that would be really cool to get RTX.

476
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:46,149
Speaker 1: But what uses that?

477
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:46,512
Speaker 1: Nothing.

478
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,419
Speaker 1: So why would I buy it?

479
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:58,160
Speaker 1: So what Nvidia has done is they sort of included a couple technologies to try to break that chicken and egg cycle, which is, I think, pretty clever from a business standpoint.

480
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:08,640
Speaker 1: So the first technology that they've added is basically it should be theoretically possible.

481
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:21,020
Speaker 1: And the example they gave us, of course, a Skyrim mod for somebody to make mods of existing games such that they now use real time ray tracing.

482
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,200
Speaker 1: So you could, I think someone or they made one as a demo.

483
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,561
Speaker 1: Right.

484
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,506
Speaker 1: It's like, ah, get your Skyrim.

485
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:31,580
Speaker 1: And if you've got this card, you can play in an even fancier graphics mode.

486
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:32,122
Speaker 1: Right.

487
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,045
Speaker 1: That no one else can do.

488
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:37,059
Speaker 1: Even though it's an existing game and the developer of the game didn't have to do anything.

489
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:41,706
Speaker 1: I'm just getting over a non.

490
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:45,020
Speaker 1: we got a non covid sinus cold going on around this week here.

491
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,724
Speaker 0: Ah, that's always the worst.

492
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:47,467
Speaker 1: Yep.

493
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:48,511
Speaker 1: We tested.

494
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,700
Speaker 1: We're sure it's not the it's not the sea anyway.

495
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:58,940
Speaker 1: The other thing they added was this feature where, OK, you've got these ray tracing cores in there.

496
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,421
Speaker 1: Right.

497
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:00,906
Speaker 1: But you're not ray tracing.

498
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,612
Speaker 1: You're playing some old ass game.

499
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:05,040
Speaker 0: The example on their website is Portal and they have a screenshot.

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,120
Speaker 1: Right.

501
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:12,218
Speaker 1: So you're playing Portal and, you know, Portal is only going to go like it's only rendering 60 FPS.

502
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:16,047
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like, come on.

503
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:21,760
Speaker 1: But what you could do, for example, is, OK, you know, I got Portal.

504
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:23,830
Speaker 1: It's running at 60 FPS or whatever.

505
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,860
Speaker 1: But I've got such a ridiculous video card.

506
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,428
Speaker 1: Portal is an old game and I've got a monitor.

507
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:32,500
Speaker 1: My monitor goes to 144 hertz because I got a ridiculous, fancy monitor.

508
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:32,961
Speaker 1: Right.

509
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:39,880
Speaker 1: Well, what you can do is you can tell the video card, hey, I know you got those ray tracing cores you're not using.

510
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:45,100
Speaker 1: Why don't you use them and some machine learning stuff that you're so good at you GPU.

511
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:46,001
Speaker 1: Right.

512
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:53,620
Speaker 1: And you're so fast at it that even though the game in the frame buffer is rendering, you know, 60 frames a second.

513
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:53,921
Speaker 1: Right.

514
00:31:53,941 --> 00:32:00,678
Speaker 1: So here comes a frame and then one sixtieth of a second later, another frames coming in the A.I.

515
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:01,560
Speaker 1: in quotes.

516
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:02,181
Speaker 1: Right.

517
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:24,071
Speaker 1: With using those RTX cores that are otherwise dormant can look at the previous frames and basically interpolate and guess and generate a frame to go in between the current frame and the next frame and show it to you fast enough before the next frame actually is going to be displayed.

518
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:25,480
Speaker 1: a sixtieth of a second later.

519
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,440
Speaker 1: Right.

520
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:35,200
Speaker 1: And thus you'll get those frames won't be like actual game frames because like the game input wouldn't be processed on those frames.

521
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:42,820
Speaker 1: But it would be adding like an extra draw, you know, method, you know, run an extra draw loop only.

522
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,321
Speaker 1: Yeah.

523
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:43,621
Speaker 1: Right.

524
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:44,583
Speaker 1: To the game.

525
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:58,380
Speaker 1: So basically the effect of this would be that the motion of the game would be like unnaturally smooth compared to what it would normally be because you're just inventing new frames.

526
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,262
Speaker 1: Right.

527
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,738
Speaker 1: Visually to go in between the ones that are already there.

528
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:11,960
Speaker 0: Because on one hand, it does theoretically alter the game from what the developers intended into.

529
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,243
Speaker 0: You know, you're seeing something different.

530
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:17,192
Speaker 0: But at the same time, these are mostly micro differences.

531
00:33:18,294 --> 00:33:20,680
Speaker 1: that kind of just a cool demo.

532
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,949
Speaker 1: But like, does anyone actually fucking need that?

533
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,440
Speaker 1: It's you just do that to show off your money, basically.

534
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:25,801
Speaker 1: Right.

535
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:34,499
Speaker 0: But it's hard, though, because I remember when I first got a real 4K monitor and that was right around when auto chess was popular.

536
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,365
Speaker 0: Like I got a good 4K monitor.

537
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,869
Speaker 0: I got everything working.

538
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,560
Speaker 0: I play auto chess and it just looked better.

539
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:43,406
Speaker 0: But I couldn't articulate why.

540
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:45,594
Speaker 0: And I wasn't sure if it was, you know, my bias.

541
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,360
Speaker 0: Like, well, of course, you know, I think it looks better.

542
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:54,687
Speaker 0: I bought this fancy monitor and then Scott came over to your geek nights and you literally said the words, why the fuck do your fonts look so good?

543
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:55,069
Speaker 0: What did you?

544
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:58,460
Speaker 0: what did you do anyway?

545
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,640
Speaker 1: But the point is, this is a. regardless of how useful these features are, they are a from a business standpoint.

546
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:06,281
Speaker 1: Right.

547
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:08,507
Speaker 1: A clever way to break out of that chicken egg.

548
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:20,020
Speaker 1: And video can sell this to people as saying, yes, if you buy this card, there are things you can do to make games you're already playing look either better and or smoother.

549
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:29,139
Speaker 1: Even if game developers do not support any of these features in their development cycle and thus maybe they can get some sales.

550
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,699
Speaker 1: And if they get some sales, then game developers would hopefully make games with RTX mode in them.

551
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:37,487
Speaker 1: And then they would take off.

552
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:37,808
Speaker 1: Right.

553
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:40,460
Speaker 1: And I don't think this AMD have the RTX mode.

554
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:41,263
Speaker 1: Right.

555
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:42,447
Speaker 1: Is that what their end game?

556
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,570
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

557
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,420
Speaker 0: Never mind, like video encoding, all the other stuff gamers care about.

558
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,820
Speaker 0: Like if you're streaming yourself, NVENC just works and these cards are crazy fast at it.

559
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,480
Speaker 0: OBS just now implemented some basic support for one of AMD's equivalents.

560
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:05,820
Speaker 1: So there is a googled for AMD ray tracing and they do seem to have Radeon Pro technologies.

561
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,983
Speaker 1: OK, I guess.

562
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:07,625
Speaker 1: Yeah.

563
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,270
Speaker 1: AMD RTX.

564
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:10,333
Speaker 1: It's like do they?

565
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:12,500
Speaker 1: they have RX, but not our.

566
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,464
Speaker 1: I don't know enough about it.

567
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:20,280
Speaker 1: Someone in the chat, the listener will know if AMD has an RTX competitor.

568
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,362
Speaker 0: I mean, the listener.

569
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,267
Speaker 1: I haven't heard of them having one.

570
00:35:23,548 --> 00:35:30,126
Speaker 1: So my guess is that if Nvidia can get this to lift off, they can put AMD away.

571
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:30,628
Speaker 1: Right.

572
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:34,200
Speaker 1: By saying the games support this now only on Nvidia cards.

573
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:39,517
Speaker 1: Even if an AMD card gets faster, you know, it's like you need that real time ray tracing.

574
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:40,420
Speaker 1: and we have at the end.

575
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,940
Speaker 0: I feel like the listener is either on a Mac right now or has some sort of Nvidia GPU in their Intel CPU.

576
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

577
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:56,920
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm seriously considering more and more every day, especially like the story we just talked about with the Intel network cards.

578
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,341
Speaker 1: Right.

579
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:05,320
Speaker 1: It's like I might just get some Mac Studio, even though I still don't like Mac OS, because the CPU is the best CPU.

580
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:10,180
Speaker 1: And the 99 percent of what I do is not GPU based work personally.

581
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,021
Speaker 1: Right.

582
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:14,358
Speaker 1: Other people I know do a lot of GPU based work, but I don't like it.

583
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,166
Speaker 1: It's like it's the.

584
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:21,340
Speaker 1: it's just that CPU, the M2, the M3, whatever is going to be out.

585
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:21,721
Speaker 1: Right.

586
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:25,360
Speaker 1: Well, is the best unless Intel comes out again with something better again.

587
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,965
Speaker 1: That's the best CPU.

588
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:31,480
Speaker 0: Oh, they show stats for Premiere and After Effects and all that stuff.

589
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:35,759
Speaker 0: And even the 3080 kicks the shit out of an M2.

590
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:44,660
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you know, but it's like the CPU is what 90 percent of my work is based on that.

591
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:45,302
Speaker 1: Right.

592
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:47,749
Speaker 1: Then I could get one of those.

593
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:51,420
Speaker 1: And then what I could do is I could get an Nvidia card.

594
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:52,121
Speaker 1: Right.

595
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:58,800
Speaker 1: And stick it in a little tiny box in the corner with no just, you know, in the corner over there.

596
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:05,720
Speaker 1: And if I would need to play a game, I can just use steam link or something like that, remote desktop or some, you know, I have to.

597
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,220
Speaker 1: If I really have to KVM and just any gaming stuff, which is the only thing I ever really use a GPU for over there.

598
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:16,229
Speaker 1: And then use the Mac Studio for everything else.

599
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,698
Speaker 1: I might go that route in a in a year or so.

600
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:19,420
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

601
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:29,760
Speaker 0: So I think because I am I'm at a point where I can't upgrade to Windows 11 because I am still running a sixth generation Intel CPU and I'm not even CPU bound.

602
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,814
Speaker 0: I would not upgrade my computer except in twenty twenty five.

603
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,180
Speaker 0: I'm going to run out of Windows updates.

604
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,900
Speaker 1: So and that's only it's still three years is plenty of time.

605
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,883
Speaker 0: Yeah.

606
00:37:40,903 --> 00:37:44,980
Speaker 0: So but I was going to upgrade my GPU because I'm running it.

607
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,497
Speaker 0: I am I'm GPU bound with my 1080 on a lot of things I want to do.

608
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,209
Speaker 1: Seventy still does everything I want to do.

609
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:52,991
Speaker 0: My 1080 does not.

610
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:56,521
Speaker 0: And I could get the 3080.

611
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,385
Speaker 0: I did double check.

612
00:37:57,445 --> 00:38:01,520
Speaker 0: I would have to get a bigger power supply, which makes that less of a good value proposition.

613
00:38:02,022 --> 00:38:06,879
Speaker 0: And even worse, there is no way to run a 4080 in this computer like it would not happen.

614
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,783
Speaker 1: Where would it fit?

615
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:15,380
Speaker 0: I actually have room for it just barely because I got rid of all my firewire stuff that was in there.

616
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,564
Speaker 0: That's how old this computer is.

617
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:21,360
Speaker 0: But it would take up basically the entirety of the case to put that video card in there.

618
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:25,559
Speaker 0: And I don't have enough surface area to cool it properly if I do that.

619
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:37,460
Speaker 1: The only thing about the Mac route is that, you know, you unlike a desktop PC, which you can fill with hard drives, you know, the Mac comes with the storage it comes with and they overcharge you for it.

620
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:45,860
Speaker 1: So if I did that, I would have to basically reload my NAS with all new drives that are much larger because that would end up having to do a lot of work suddenly.

621
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,441
Speaker 1: Right.

622
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:48,268
Speaker 1: So I'm waiting.

623
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,920
Speaker 1: I've been monitoring the prices of NAS drives because mine's almost full anyway.

624
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:56,090
Speaker 0: It's been a while since we did a Geeknight, so we've been talking for a while.

625
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:05,103
Speaker 0: So rather than doing the rest of our news, I think we should go right into... Things of the Day!

626
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:09,232
Speaker 0: So randomly, the algorithm, I never watch this channel.

627
00:39:09,252 --> 00:39:14,985
Speaker 0: I like Legos, well Lego bricks, but I am not like... I live in a New York apartment.

628
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,874
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go down that road again.

629
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:18,040
Speaker 0: I know where that road leads.

630
00:39:18,562 --> 00:39:22,619
Speaker 1: There's one Lego set I really want and I still haven't bought it because I know where to put it.

631
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:30,560
Speaker 0: So my favorite Lego set ever, of all time in my entire life, was the original castle Lego stuff.

632
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,252
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean the whole set?

633
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:32,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too.

634
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,420
Speaker 0: Like the Crusader guys with the triangle looking helmets and the horses and the castles.

635
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:40,499
Speaker 1: They recently came out with a new castle too.

636
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:40,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

637
00:39:41,282 --> 00:39:47,739
Speaker 0: So I saw this video, the algorithm recommended to me, and it was titled, "The Most Disturbing Lego Set

638
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,080
Speaker 0: Ever.".

639
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:50,968
Speaker 0: And I'm thinking, all right, what's this?

640
00:39:51,008 --> 00:39:52,432
Speaker 0: Some creepypasta thing?

641
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:53,134
Speaker 0: Like what?

642
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:53,937
Speaker 0: Some backstory?

643
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:54,057
Speaker 0: Like.

644
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:54,980
Speaker 0: I'm curious what this will be.

645
00:39:55,421 --> 00:40:00,932
Speaker 0: But then the rest of the title, the subtitle is, "From the Lego Castle 1981 set, one specific

646
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:01,233
Speaker 0: subset.".

647
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:09,320
Speaker 0: One of those little sets you could buy, the ones that your parents would buy for you when they wouldn't buy you like the giant thing.

648
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:12,080
Speaker 1: You mean every single time I went to Toys R Us?

649
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,317
Speaker 0: Yup, we'd get one of those instead of an NES game.

650
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,506
Speaker 0: Yup.

651
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,992
Speaker 0: Knight's Procession, specifically, which I remembered and we had.

652
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,475
Speaker 0: It was a tiny little set.

653
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,560
Speaker 0: It was like six Lego knight guys.

654
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,188
Speaker 1: I have this one.

655
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:28,019
Speaker 1: Let's see.

656
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,020
Speaker 0: It was six little knight guys with two different kinds of helmets with the original shields and little swords and axes.

657
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:38,420
Speaker 0: And a little pull cart with wheels with just some stuff in the cart.

658
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:41,079
Speaker 1: I did not have this one.

659
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,596
Speaker 0: I absolutely had this one.

660
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:50,817
Speaker 0: So this video about this tiny Lego set that has like less than, it has 39 pieces.

661
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:52,200
Speaker 0: This is not a big Lego set.

662
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:54,814
Speaker 0: "The Most Disturbing Lego Set

663
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:55,076
Speaker 0: Ever.".

664
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,539
Speaker 0: I'm looking at this picture and I cannot imagine what they think is disturbing about it.

665
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:10,529
Speaker 0: So I watched this video and in nine minutes and sixteen seconds this person has made a fairly credible argument that this is a very

666
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:11,950
Speaker 1: oddly specific

667
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:22,060
Speaker 0: and uncharacteristic reference by whoever designed the set at Lego to a specific incident during one of the crusades outside the walls of Jerusalem.

668
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,969
Speaker 0: And I'm not saying this person is right.

669
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:27,360
Speaker 0: I suspect this person is very wrong.

670
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,500
Speaker 0: But it's quite a journey to watch this video and I recommend you enjoy it.

671
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:37,094
Speaker 0: So that's what I got.

672
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:37,600
Speaker 0: What do you got?

673
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:44,755
Speaker 1: So I'm the kind of person where, you know, am I good at that?

674
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:45,478
Speaker 1: many things?

675
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:46,080
Speaker 1: No.

676
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,624
Speaker 1: Do I know that many things?

677
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:52,980
Speaker 1: No, I just read the internet a lot and then I repeat what I read on the internet and I sound like I know things.

678
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:53,461
Speaker 1: Right.

679
00:41:54,243 --> 00:42:01,220
Speaker 1: But one thing I try to do in life in general is to learn and use correct techniques.

680
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,761
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:13,400
Speaker 1: Even if you're not good at a thing, if you use the correct technique, even if you are not practiced at it, you'll usually just get better results and an easier life overall.

682
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,125
Speaker 0: Like mini golf between the two of us.

683
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:19,098
Speaker 0: How many times have we taught some random person we know like how to use a putter?

684
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,461
Speaker 1: Yep.

685
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:21,809
Speaker 0: It's a fairly straightforward.

686
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:23,177
Speaker 0: There's a very specific way to do it.

687
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,481
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,669
Speaker 1: It's like if I'm in the kitchen, can I go chop, chop, chop, chop, chop?

689
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,320
Speaker 1: No, but I hold the knife the way the chef holds the knife.

690
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,562
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:30,320
Speaker 0: I just go slower.

692
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,441
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:32,261
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah.

694
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:36,465
Speaker 1: So, you know, and I think what in our just in our general society.

695
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:37,146
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:52,700
Speaker 1: There are a lot of things for which the correct technique is not like widely known or widely taught, no matter how simple it is or even if it or it's not taught well in a way that people can understand.

697
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,780
Speaker 0: That's the part having watched your thing of the day that I think is going on here, because I actually went and grabbed something, tried what's in the video.

698
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:03,760
Speaker 0: And yeah, I was always doing it that way, but I never thought about it that way.

699
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:04,921
Speaker 1: Right.

700
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:09,780
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, or people just don't care about using the correct technique or not coachable.

701
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:13,428
Speaker 1: But I remember very specifically.

702
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:13,728
Speaker 1: Right.

703
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:18,340
Speaker 1: It's like when I was actually when I was so old, I was already a counselor at a summer camp.

704
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,688
Speaker 1: I think I was already like in between freshman and sophomore years at RIT.

705
00:43:21,728 --> 00:43:21,848
Speaker 1: Right.

706
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:23,692
Speaker 1: It was already two thousand something one.

707
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:24,153
Speaker 1: Right.

708
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:24,895
Speaker 1: Two thousand.

709
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:25,556
Speaker 1: Two thousand.

710
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:26,097
Speaker 1: Yeah.

711
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:27,180
Speaker 1: Two thousand one summer.

712
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,873
Speaker 1: And someone finally taught me like the technique to throw a baseball correctly.

713
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:34,554
Speaker 1: Right.

714
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,777
Speaker 1: I was in little league and shit.

715
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:37,260
Speaker 1: No one ever taught me that correctly.

716
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,367
Speaker 1: Or at least I was in a way that I understood and remembered.

717
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:40,888
Speaker 1: Right.

718
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,560
Speaker 1: And as soon as I followed that technique and I threw the ball and I hit the other guy's glove, it was like pow.

719
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,543
Speaker 1: And I was like, I'm not strong.

720
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:50,747
Speaker 1: I wasn't strong then and I'm not strong now.

721
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:51,368
Speaker 0: Yeah.

722
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:51,588
Speaker 0: Right.

723
00:43:51,848 --> 00:43:52,930
Speaker 0: Skiing is a lot like that.

724
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:54,172
Speaker 0: You do skiing wrong.

725
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:57,598
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, but when you feel it, suddenly you're just like a thousand times better.

726
00:43:57,838 --> 00:43:58,960
Speaker 0: The whole world feels different.

727
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,165
Speaker 1: So I came across this YouTube video.

728
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,289
Speaker 1: It's like 48 seconds.

729
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,092
Speaker 1: It's really short.

730
00:44:03,473 --> 00:44:05,520
Speaker 1: I think it is a YouTube short specifically, maybe.

731
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,380
Speaker 0: I got to say, though, watching this, I think I would be better at swinging a bat, even though I would think I was already doing this.

732
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:12,543
Speaker 1: Like this is all you need.

733
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:14,088
Speaker 1: It's like, why are you hiring a hitting coach?

734
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:17,999
Speaker 1: This guy is a hitting coach for professional baseball, presumably.

735
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:18,400
Speaker 1: Right.

736
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,426
Speaker 1: Like that's it seems like it's this person's job or part of their job.

737
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:28,240
Speaker 1: And in that short amount of time, he demonstrates the correct technique for swinging a baseball bat.

738
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:31,290
Speaker 1: And it's like, why did they fucking tell me that shit and T-ball?

739
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,959
Speaker 1: I could have smacked the ball right out of the park if I knew that.

740
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:34,180
Speaker 1: Right.

741
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:45,640
Speaker 1: It's like, um, so yeah, if you are, uh, ever planning to swing a baseball bat for the legitimate purpose or illegitimate purpose.

742
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:53,060
Speaker 0: I would say no, because if you're swinging a baseball bat for an illegitimate purpose, my advice to you is to hold it backwards.

743
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:55,226
Speaker 0: That sounds crazy and stupid.

744
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:59,999
Speaker 0: You will be way more effective at causing the harm you intend to harm that way.

745
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,317
Speaker 1: Anyway, you could still swing in the way in the video to get the most oomph.

746
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:09,048
Speaker 0: Also, I feel like you're better off doing a lot more jabbing and poking.

747
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:13,340
Speaker 1: But anyway, the point is, watch this.

748
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:19,459
Speaker 1: You'll spend one minute and the rest of your life, you will now know the correct technique for this in case you ever have to do it.

749
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:22,429
Speaker 1: Um, and you'll be like, wow, it'll be so great.

750
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,152
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

751
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:25,620
Speaker 0: Cause like the pivot around the immobile foot.

752
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,048
Speaker 0: Like I remember being like taught that by my dad.

753
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,158
Speaker 0: But the thing with the hands, I did not realize.

754
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:31,900
Speaker 0: that's what happens.

755
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,649
Speaker 0: Like I never, I never in my life heard it described that way.

756
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,035
Speaker 0: And that was it.

757
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:38,395
Speaker 0: 42 seconds.

758
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:39,658
Speaker 1: Yep.

759
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:40,320
Speaker 0: So good.

760
00:45:41,787 --> 00:45:42,480
Speaker 0: In the meta moment.

761
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:43,862
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is back.

762
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:49,533
Speaker 0: The last panel that we did was actually me and Emily at PAX West 2022.

763
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:50,275
Speaker 0: Losing.

764
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,678
Speaker 0: It is online on YouTube.

765
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:52,399
Speaker 0: You can just watch it.

766
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,527
Speaker 0: Uh, Geek Nights will be at PAX Unplugged.

767
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:59,780
Speaker 0: Maybe me and Scott, maybe just me doing one or more panels and workshops.

768
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:02,849
Speaker 0: But I don't think we'll be hanging around too much outside of that.

769
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,300
Speaker 1: Also, as of today, you said you were going to go there and come back in the same day.

770
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:07,022
Speaker 0: Yep.

771
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:08,265
Speaker 0: Very likely.

772
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:11,354
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll spend one night and head back the following day.

773
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:13,400
Speaker 0: TBD on the schedule of the panels and everything.

774
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,424
Speaker 0: I will warn you, all the hotels are sold out.

775
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:16,965
Speaker 0: So.

776
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:18,047
Speaker 1: Yeah.

777
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:26,620
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not, I'm either, I'm only, the only chance of me going with the sold out hotel situation is, you know, someplace else to stay.

778
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,172
Speaker 1: Like a friend's house who lives nearby or not staying.

779
00:46:30,273 --> 00:46:32,039
Speaker 0: And we will probably just bring the car.

780
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 0: It is a real easy trip.

781
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:42,560
Speaker 0: And also I got to tell you, cause I know you have, I have presented at a few PAXes without you during the quarantine.

782
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:52,280
Speaker 0: It is hard to describe how much life it gives me to be on stage at a PAX with people giving a talk instead of doing the podcast.

783
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,226
Speaker 0: Like I didn't forget how much I loved it.

784
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,292
Speaker 0: I underestimated how much I missed.

785
00:46:57,352 --> 00:46:58,675
Speaker 0: it is how I would describe it.

786
00:46:59,036 --> 00:47:00,139
Speaker 0: There's a certain energy there.

787
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:00,560
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

788
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,143
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

789
00:47:02,243 --> 00:47:02,424
Speaker 1: Yep.

790
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:03,989
Speaker 0: I will also be a Zenkai Con.

791
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,212
Speaker 0: I even booked the hotel room.

792
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:07,800
Speaker 0: I'll do a whole bunch of solo versions of our panels.

793
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,690
Speaker 0: Scott won't come to Zenkai Con even in non-COVID times.

794
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,277
Speaker 1: No, I wouldn't come there without a pandemic.

795
00:47:12,317 --> 00:47:12,980
Speaker 1: I'm definitely not going to.

796
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,682
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

797
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:19,939
Speaker 0: Most of Zenkai Con is me, Chris, Anthony, and Scojo playing tabletop board games sometimes with Matt Morgan.

798
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:20,320
Speaker 0: So.

799
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,121
Speaker 1: I'm good.

800
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,685
Speaker 0: I don't know.

801
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:26,996
Speaker 0: It's basically just, it's a fantastic con that we just don't even go into except for the panels.

802
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,280
Speaker 0: But I digress.

803
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,998
Speaker 1: Why don't we just do that at my apartment then?

804
00:47:30,901 --> 00:47:31,622
Speaker 0: We could do that too.

805
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:33,746
Speaker 0: The Gignies Book Club book.

806
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:39,374
Speaker 0: Binti, which I will also, as Scott had pointed out, Binti is very short.

807
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:42,940
Speaker 0: It's actually a trilogy of three also very short books.

808
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,362
Speaker 0: I read all three.

809
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:45,665
Speaker 0: Scott read all three.

810
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:47,290
Speaker 1: They take like an hour each.

811
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,433
Speaker 0: We'll talk about all three.

812
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:50,277
Speaker 0: It's fantastic.

813
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:51,300
Speaker 0: It is Space College.

814
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:59,540
Speaker 0: And basically, if you don't know what it's about, it's going to set itself up like, all right, cool person's going to Space College.

815
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:01,926
Speaker 0: They're probably experiencing racism.

816
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:03,129
Speaker 0: Let's see where this is going.

817
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,260
Speaker 0: And then the jellyfish show up out of nowhere and it goes way off the rails.

818
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:10,527
Speaker 0: But it still stays true to that original starting story.

819
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:15,138
Speaker 0: I would love to see this animated in some fashion.

820
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:16,000
Speaker 0: I think it would be great.

821
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:20,540
Speaker 1: It would be a good animated one, yeah, especially with all the wild characters and such.

822
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:22,924
Speaker 1: All right.

823
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:25,010
Speaker 0: Otherwise, Scott's working on the website.

824
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,113
Speaker 0: Pay attention to our stuff.

825
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:28,700
Speaker 0: We'll be mostly doing content like normal.

826
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:34,937
Speaker 0: Whenever the new Advanced Wars that was delayed because of the war actually comes out, I am going to be live streaming it.

827
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:35,820
Speaker 0: So stay tuned for that.

828
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:37,900
Speaker 0: And let's talk about web scraping.

829
00:48:39,081 --> 00:48:39,442
Speaker 1: Yeah.

830
00:48:39,563 --> 00:48:45,540
Speaker 1: So when you have a website, right, especially a dynamic website, even if it's just a blog.

831
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:45,981
Speaker 1: Right.

832
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:54,320
Speaker 1: But it could also be something like, I don't know, a sports stats website or news website or any kind of information providing website.

833
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,344
Speaker 1: IMDB, Wikipedia.

834
00:48:56,564 --> 00:48:56,785
Speaker 1: Right.

835
00:48:57,246 --> 00:49:02,760
Speaker 1: All these websites are backed up by databases, Postgres databases, MySQL databases, Oracle databases.

836
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:03,282
Speaker 1: Right.

837
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:07,820
Speaker 1: But you can't just go in and given people access directly to the database.

838
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:11,660
Speaker 0: So a lot of people do by accident, but that's a whole other conversation.

839
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,579
Speaker 1: It's really bad for a lot of reasons that we can't really discuss right now.

840
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:15,780
Speaker 1: Right.

841
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:23,880
Speaker 1: It would actually be really nice if you had a way to do it securely, safely and a way that protects your resources and whatnot.

842
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,263
Speaker 0: But so what I'll say?

843
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:31,779
Speaker 0: not to decide that is the kind of thing that I provide as a service and I'm a product manager for my day job.

844
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:32,866
Speaker 1: But it's not.

845
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:34,255
Speaker 1: you're not making that available.

846
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:34,960
Speaker 1: It's like the public.

847
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,579
Speaker 0: No, that is not available to the public.

848
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:37,541
Speaker 1: Right.

849
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:39,786
Speaker 1: Plenty of people provide private database access.

850
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:41,550
Speaker 1: I'm talking about public database access.

851
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,820
Speaker 1: Like anyone can just go connect to database, select star from.

852
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:46,203
Speaker 1: Right.

853
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:46,545
Speaker 1: It's like.

854
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:48,400
Speaker 1: no one does that on purpose.

855
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:55,720
Speaker 1: So what ends up happening is the only way to access the information that is in the database is via the website.

856
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,382
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

857
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:57,147
Speaker 0: I said a great idea.

858
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,253
Speaker 0: I don't have to interrupt you.

859
00:49:58,514 --> 00:49:59,440
Speaker 0: We should make this website.

860
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,726
Speaker 0: It would fail and collapse instantly.

861
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,852
Speaker 0: Let's make Wikibase.

862
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:06,138
Speaker 0: It's just a public database.

863
00:50:06,198 --> 00:50:06,780
Speaker 0: Everybody go nuts.

864
00:50:08,221 --> 00:50:08,711
Speaker 1: OK, go ahead.

865
00:50:08,813 --> 00:50:09,180
Speaker 1: Here's SQL.

866
00:50:10,162 --> 00:50:14,160
Speaker 1: So you have a database and then the database is not accessible to the Internet.

867
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:14,762
Speaker 1: Right.

868
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:18,100
Speaker 1: And then you have a Web server and the Web server can access the database.

869
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:22,438
Speaker 1: But the Web server only has so many SQL queries that it will willingly run.

870
00:50:23,323 --> 00:50:23,505
Speaker 1: Right.

871
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:25,120
Speaker 1: That are written in the code of the website.

872
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:27,605
Speaker 1: And then people visit the website.

873
00:50:27,866 --> 00:50:34,300
Speaker 1: The website runs the SQL queries, gets data from the database and then shows it to you in HTML form.

874
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,759
Speaker 0: Which to back up a little bit.

875
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,131
Speaker 1: Or JSON.

876
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:38,060
Speaker 1: JSON structure.

877
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:55,120
Speaker 0: HTML and markup languages like it are just a standardized way to take effectively raw information from a source and mark it up in a way that can then be processed by an interpreter and displayed to a human or provided to some other service.

878
00:50:55,562 --> 00:50:56,687
Speaker 0: In a standardized way.

879
00:50:57,189 --> 00:50:59,540
Speaker 0: So the raw data comes to your Web browser.

880
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:13,220
Speaker 0: Your Web browser parses this markdown of that data and presents a visualization that if you recall how the Internet was designed, how it was envisioned, the reason it exists and how it should be used and maintained.

881
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,439
Speaker 0: You can render that information however you see fit on your end.

882
00:51:19,381 --> 00:51:41,320
Speaker 1: So the reality is that people who aren't technologically sophisticated are sort of forced by lack of know how, lack of ability, lack of resources to engage with the data in the database on the terms of the person who owns and runs the database.

883
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,060
Speaker 1: The service operator sets the terms and the people just sort of have to go along with it.

884
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:52,980
Speaker 1: If you want to go to a normal person wants to see like the scores of every Mets game.

885
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:53,924
Speaker 1: Right.

886
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:55,819
Speaker 1: Until they got hosed last night.

887
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,778
Speaker 1: The whole season.

888
00:51:58,931 --> 00:51:59,140
Speaker 1: Right.

889
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,943
Speaker 1: They would have to go to like.

890
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:09,840
Speaker 1: they would have to open up the Web browser, go to a game and they'd probably do something like fucking copy and paste and they go to the next game and copy and paste or something like that.

891
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,440
Speaker 1: Right.

892
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:17,620
Speaker 1: But if you're technologically sophisticated, there is not much that stops you from writing a computer program.

893
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,280
Speaker 1: Now, of course, you can't hit the database directly, which would be the most efficient way of getting the data.

894
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,517
Speaker 1: It would take a fraction of a second to get all of it.

895
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:40,180
Speaker 1: But you can have the computer just visit all the Web pages really quickly, save all the Web pages and then process all those Web pages and parse the data out of them right into what is now your database.

896
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:41,457
Speaker 1: And now you're good to go.

897
00:52:41,747 --> 00:52:41,960
Speaker 1: Right.

898
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:57,400
Speaker 1: And that's called Web scraping because you're basically going to Web pages and scraping the data off of them right into your own database to get access to a large amount of information that is being made freely available.

899
00:52:58,081 --> 00:53:05,159
Speaker 1: But the people making it freely available weren't making it like in bulk freely available, but it kind of were and they kind of weren't.

900
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:19,074
Speaker 0: Now, this is where things get spicy, because on one hand, the Internet, the World Wide Web was envisioned to be a completely open and mutual sharing of information, meaning I provide information, but other people have access to that.

901
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:24,760
Speaker 0: information is kind of like I have taken this data and I've put it out on the street and anyone is allowed to partake.

902
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:38,200
Speaker 1: So legally, as of April this year, there was actually a case in an appeals court and they have affirmed that Web scraping publicly accessible data is legal.

903
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:42,840
Speaker 1: Now, that's just the scraping part of it, though, right?

904
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:52,920
Speaker 1: If I was to say scrape rim website, right, which is full of rims copyrighted information or whatever, and I put it, I scrape it and put in a database.

905
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:54,720
Speaker 1: OK, nothing illegal.

906
00:53:55,262 --> 00:53:58,219
Speaker 1: But if I then go and make Scott clone of rims Web site.

907
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:00,460
Speaker 1: Well, now that's not right.

908
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:07,094
Speaker 1: It's like copying someone's Web site might not be legal, but now collecting the data on its own might be.

909
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:09,860
Speaker 0: the crime is not getting the data or scraping.

910
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,640
Speaker 0: The crime is now you're republishing it and violating copyright.

911
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,866
Speaker 0: Effectively.

912
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:14,007
Speaker 1: Yeah.

913
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:15,339
Speaker 1: Or who knows what it could be?

914
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:18,460
Speaker 1: Some other thing you're now this gets extra spicy.

915
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:24,600
Speaker 0: What if rim website has information that is objective?

916
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:25,508
Speaker 0: I have.

917
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,580
Speaker 0: I have equations.

918
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:28,706
Speaker 0: I have weather information like.

919
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:33,640
Speaker 0: I have objective, universally agreed upon and generic information on my Web site.

920
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:35,798
Speaker 0: Scott could scrape that for me.

921
00:54:36,142 --> 00:54:38,320
Speaker 0: He might scrape it from someone else who could.

922
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,780
Speaker 0: There's no way to prove where Scott got that information.

923
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:43,319
Speaker 0: And if Scott there can be well, we'll get to that.

924
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:54,240
Speaker 0: If Scott publishes that information, you generally can't have copyright on individual well-known proven facts with a big asterisk that there's a lot of complicated edge cases.

925
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:03,960
Speaker 1: But let's say in my data, copyright would be like I scrape rims Web site of all his short stories and I publish a Kindle book.

926
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,478
Speaker 1: That would be a copyright violation.

927
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:14,560
Speaker 0: So what if I aggregate data from a bunch of other Web sites and make a new data set that provides novel insights without republishing that data itself?

928
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,060
Speaker 0: Now, it's again, it's not a question of Web scraping.

929
00:55:18,522 --> 00:55:22,140
Speaker 0: That is the question of data aggregation, data attribution, et cetera.

930
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,960
Speaker 0: Web scraping itself should be noncontroversial and should absolutely be 100 percent legal forever.

931
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:37,320
Speaker 0: But most of the fights around it are around what people do with that information after the fact, not the scraping itself.

932
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,702
Speaker 1: Exactly.

933
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:44,580
Speaker 1: Now, one thing that happens is sometimes people will set up their Web servers to be anti scraping.

934
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:44,961
Speaker 1: Right.

935
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:52,600
Speaker 1: They'll do things like blocking user agents that don't match the user agents of normal Web browsers, which you can get around pretty easily.

936
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:58,680
Speaker 1: They'll do things like rate limiting, like someone has hit our Web site and requested a shit ton of pages really quickly.

937
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,871
Speaker 1: Let's block their IP address now.

938
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:02,740
Speaker 1: They're hitting they're visiting us too much.

939
00:56:02,841 --> 00:56:04,209
Speaker 1: That's clearly not a human being.

940
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,780
Speaker 0: Now, they're within their rights to do that.

941
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,420
Speaker 0: But simultaneously, I'm within my rights to spin up a thousand Amazon businesses with different IPs to scrape that data.

942
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, and there's a lot of things going on, right?

943
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,580
Speaker 1: I mean, what is Google?

944
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,184
Speaker 1: Google's entire business is Web scraping.

945
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:31,960
Speaker 1: The Google bot goes around scraping the entire Web and then you Google search something and they search their database, which is a copy of most of the Web that they've scraped with the Google bot.

946
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:40,940
Speaker 1: And then they show you results without actually sending you to anyone's Web site, just showing you data they've scraped from other people's Web sites.

947
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:42,002
Speaker 1: Yeah.

948
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:46,019
Speaker 1: And this is what all the fight is about things like Google News and Australia and all this stuff.

949
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:46,220
Speaker 1: Right.

950
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,152
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and this is getting like.

951
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,120
Speaker 0: capitalism is partly the problem here.

952
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,260
Speaker 0: The true intent of the Internet is is up for debate here.

953
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:55,483
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on.

954
00:56:55,523 --> 00:57:11,220
Speaker 0: But a big part of this is a lot of Web scraping is used for commercial purposes and data aggregation, but also a lot of Web scraping is used to bridge the non-technical and the technical or to bridge the inept technical with the technical.

955
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:11,962
Speaker 0: Case in point.

956
00:57:12,002 --> 00:57:12,906
Speaker 0: Imagine a restaurant.

957
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:14,673
Speaker 0: Restaurant has a Web site.

958
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:16,500
Speaker 0: The Web site posts its hours.

959
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:26,119
Speaker 0: Good luck finding that Web site because that Web site was made by someone's nephew in nineteen ninety nine and hasn't changed in 20 years.

960
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,669
Speaker 0: But you want to find out when this restaurant is open.

961
00:57:29,172 --> 00:57:30,740
Speaker 0: You don't want to call this restaurant.

962
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:36,140
Speaker 0: You want to go to some map service or type the name of the restaurant and just see what the hours are.

963
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,820
Speaker 0: And you don't necessarily want to have to go to 10 different restaurants Web sites to figure out when things are open or not.

964
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:44,511
Speaker 0: So that kind of data aggregation is just a quality of life thing.

965
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:47,720
Speaker 1: Most restaurants did the person who runs that restaurant.

966
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,323
Speaker 1: They have a shitty Web site.

967
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:56,100
Speaker 1: But did that person go to Yelp, to Grubhub, to Seamless, to Google Maps, to Apple Maps and type in their hours?

968
00:57:56,521 --> 00:58:00,012
Speaker 1: Did they go and update their hours to match their real hours?

969
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:02,640
Speaker 1: It's like, no, that person is not doing any of those things.

970
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,562
Speaker 1: They're running the restaurant.

971
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:09,720
Speaker 1: They're ordering food, cooking food, managing employees, cleaning, hoping the health inspector doesn't come.

972
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:11,065
Speaker 1: That's what they're.

973
00:58:11,085 --> 00:58:11,928
Speaker 1: that's what they're up to.

974
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:12,289
Speaker 1: Right.

975
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:14,979
Speaker 1: Dealing with customers that are annoying, et cetera.

976
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:25,080
Speaker 1: So but as long as the information is somewhere out there in a really shitty, hard to find place, all those other services that people actually use.

977
00:58:25,581 --> 00:58:25,881
Speaker 1: Right.

978
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:33,540
Speaker 1: Can scrape it, put it into a database that's, you know, more easily searched, more technologically up to date.

979
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:37,106
Speaker 1: And then when you ask Siri, hey, when's the restaurant open?

980
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:45,100
Speaker 1: Siri says, ah, it's open at seven, because somewhere along the line, they scrape that shit from somewhere and put it in some database.

981
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:58,900
Speaker 0: Now, this is a topic for another show, but a logical extension of this that caused a big brouhaha, and I actually just used it today, which made things extra funny, is you can apply Web scraping to humans.

982
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:04,710
Speaker 0: Imagine a hotel, a bed and breakfast that doesn't even have a Web site.

983
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:08,096
Speaker 0: They just have a phone number and you can call.

984
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:10,640
Speaker 0: or maybe they have a Web site that says they exist.

985
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:12,665
Speaker 0: And on that Web site is a phone number.

986
00:59:13,026 --> 00:59:18,420
Speaker 0: But to reserve a room, you can't go to like any of the Web sites that help you reserve hotel rooms.

987
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,844
Speaker 0: You can't even go to their Web site.

988
00:59:20,085 --> 00:59:25,160
Speaker 0: You have to call them and talk to a human because they have not used modern technology.

989
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,769
Speaker 0: Now, there's two ways to approach that for me, an impatient nerd who wants to book a hotel room.

990
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:36,840
Speaker 0: My previous answer for most of my life would be if you don't have a Web site, I will not engage in commerce with you.

991
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:38,420
Speaker 1: Or you could just fucking call them.

992
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,739
Speaker 0: I don't have Web sites that don't exist.

993
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,585
Speaker 1: You just call them.

994
00:59:41,685 --> 00:59:43,937
Speaker 1: Engage with them on their own terms.

995
00:59:43,977 --> 00:59:44,560
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

996
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:46,684
Speaker 0: So here's my actual use case.

997
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:50,190
Speaker 0: Usually I'm just going somewhere like a small town to ski or on that bike trip.

998
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,353
Speaker 0: I see there's like 10 hotels in town.

999
00:59:52,914 --> 00:59:54,477
Speaker 0: I just want to see which of them have rooms.

1000
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,018
Speaker 0: Pick one.

1001
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,200
Speaker 0: Don't really care which one I stay in.

1002
00:59:56,601 --> 01:00:01,520
Speaker 0: If three of them have online booking and I can click and it just works, I'm not going to call the rest of them to figure out their opening.

1003
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,407
Speaker 1: Of course.

1004
01:00:02,508 --> 01:00:02,770
Speaker 1: Yes.

1005
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:03,153
Speaker 1: Yes.

1006
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:04,000
Speaker 1: That makes perfect sense.

1007
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:11,970
Speaker 0: So I see a hotel that looks like it has rooms, but you can't actually book rooms on their site.

1008
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:19,480
Speaker 0: So I clicked on the Google assistant and it had a robot call the hotel and talk to a human.

1009
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:24,780
Speaker 0: And it eventually reserved the room for me at this hotel.

1010
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,080
Speaker 1: And what if the human was like, well, the human clearly knows it's a robot that's calling.

1011
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:36,334
Speaker 0: Only because Google agreed based on complaints when they first launched this thing that it would say it was a robot.

1012
01:00:36,374 --> 01:00:39,240
Speaker 0: A lot of people were really mad that it might not say it's a robot.

1013
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:40,141
Speaker 1: Right.

1014
01:00:40,162 --> 01:00:45,257
Speaker 1: But what if the person heard, you know, realized that you could tell it's a robot if you're intelligent.

1015
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:45,478
Speaker 1: Right.

1016
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:46,020
Speaker 1: It's not hard.

1017
01:00:46,682 --> 01:00:47,768
Speaker 0: I've been called by this person.

1018
01:00:47,848 --> 01:00:49,799
Speaker 1: It's like a Google bot reservation hang up.

1019
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:59,659
Speaker 0: I mean, they could have, but in that case now, once again, they have walled themselves off from how most modern people will engage with things like renting a hotel room.

1020
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:09,960
Speaker 1: But the point is, is that, you know, that isn't a web scraping technology, but it is something that's only possible because of web scraping.

1021
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:12,888
Speaker 1: Get scraping that phone number from somewhere.

1022
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:13,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1023
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,200
Speaker 1: And any information, the metadata around the phone number as well.

1024
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,048
Speaker 1: That is the phone number of a BNB in this place.

1025
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:24,140
Speaker 1: You know, here's some photos of it that we scraped and collected together, et cetera.

1026
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:24,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1027
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:25,984
Speaker 0: It gets into the whole scale thing.

1028
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:28,611
Speaker 0: Remember, people freaked out about scraping the real world.

1029
01:01:28,912 --> 01:01:31,880
Speaker 0: Google Maps started having photos of the streets and street view.

1030
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:37,110
Speaker 0: And suddenly there was the debate of it's not illegal to take a picture of a random place for a public street.

1031
01:01:37,551 --> 01:01:41,740
Speaker 0: But what if you take a picture of every place from every street?

1032
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,407
Speaker 1: Suddenly you start using image recognition to read all the signs and all the businesses.

1033
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:47,168
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1034
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:54,080
Speaker 0: You could scrape if a restaurant is open from the picture of their restaurant and the sign at the door potentially.

1035
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:55,064
Speaker 1: Yep.

1036
01:01:55,606 --> 01:01:57,594
Speaker 1: If the resolution was high enough, you sure could.

1037
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,020
Speaker 1: And the picture was recent enough.

1038
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:15,000
Speaker 0: But I'm generally of the mind with web scraping that the Internet very much websites that are publicly available have to generally be treated the same way that we treat things that are visible from public streets in the real world.

1039
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,138
Speaker 0: And I can't see any strong argument against that.

1040
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,141
Speaker 0: Nope.

1041
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:26,995
Speaker 1: So if you want to do some web scraping, right, let's say, you know, there's some data you want to collect and there's no public source of that data.

1042
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:30,020
Speaker 1: that's in a database form, like a spreadsheet or something.

1043
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:36,974
Speaker 1: You have to, you know, you know, a CSV file, but you know that there's a website that has the information.

1044
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:40,020
Speaker 1: It would just take you a long time to copy and paste all those web pages.

1045
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:40,741
Speaker 1: Right.

1046
01:02:41,402 --> 01:02:42,784
Speaker 1: You can make a web scraper.

1047
01:02:42,864 --> 01:02:47,752
Speaker 1: And this generally requires computer programming, but not very difficult computer programming.

1048
01:02:48,213 --> 01:02:53,060
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of tools that already exist to solve a lot of the problems you're going to come across.

1049
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,224
Speaker 1: Like, how do I visit a Web page?

1050
01:02:55,264 --> 01:02:57,067
Speaker 1: So many Web pages very quickly.

1051
01:02:57,087 --> 01:03:05,000
Speaker 1: How do I crawl and visit one Web page, find all the URLs on that Web page, visit them and then visit those URLs recursively.

1052
01:03:05,621 --> 01:03:06,222
Speaker 1: How do I do that?

1053
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:09,890
Speaker 1: How do I want to get the HTML back from the Web site?

1054
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:14,840
Speaker 1: How do I pick out the pieces of data that I'm interested in and organize them into a spreadsheet?

1055
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:16,484
Speaker 1: How do I do this in mass?

1056
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:22,280
Speaker 1: How do I do it fast enough that it doesn't take too long, but slow enough that nobody catches on and blocks me?

1057
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:26,020
Speaker 0: It is so much easier now than the days of writing for loops with WGAD.

1058
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:27,421
Speaker 1: Right.

1059
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:27,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1060
01:03:27,922 --> 01:03:30,085
Speaker 1: So you could probably still do that to a lot of Web sites.

1061
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:38,699
Speaker 1: But what I would recommend, at least as a way to start, is there is a library called Scrapy, S-C-R-A-P-Y.

1062
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:39,560
Speaker 1: Right.

1063
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:51,640
Speaker 1: P-Y as in Python, that is, you know, basically allows you to do write a program and it solves all those common Web scraping problems for you.

1064
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:57,087
Speaker 1: And you can fully concentrate the code that you write on your specific use case.

1065
01:03:57,187 --> 01:03:57,387
Speaker 1: Right.

1066
01:03:57,447 --> 01:04:07,820
Speaker 1: Which pieces of data on the page, which page you visiting, you know, et cetera, and ignore all those sort of things that every Web scraper has to do because they're already done for you.

1067
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:16,600
Speaker 1: And, you know, if you're doing something extra fancy, extra high performance, a big deal, that might not be a permanent solution because it's not the fastest.

1068
01:04:17,281 --> 01:04:20,448
Speaker 1: But for most cases, it'll get you all the way there.

1069
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:25,720
Speaker 1: And for just about all cases, it'll be the perfect starting place to get you going.

1070
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:33,120
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know of any other like it's like it really is like the most popular Web scraping thing I know of.

1071
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:41,380
Speaker 0: I don't know of any other one that is as big a deal as as long as you're not doing something like scraping data to republish it or all the things that get another authority stuff.

1072
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:48,220
Speaker 0: Honestly, if you can come if you can scrape the Web to make your personal life locally easier, by all means, do it.

1073
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,083
Speaker 0: It's a cool thing.

1074
01:04:49,103 --> 01:04:50,328
Speaker 0: A lot of nerds do it.

1075
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,999
Speaker 0: And you can do some really cool stuff.

1076
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:01,230
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rym and Scott.

1077
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:06,370

1091
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:25,410
Speaker 1: What's that stuff?
