1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,525
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 19th 2016.

2
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:16,540
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm coughing and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,288
Speaker 0: We're talking about Ekans.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,193
Speaker 1: We don't need it.

5
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:20,338
Speaker 0: We're talking about Pokemon go.

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,358
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:26,990
Speaker 0: So yeah, we're finally back.

8
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:28,640
Speaker 0: you guys know we were in kinetic on.

9
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,070
Speaker 0: we're the heads of the panels department.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,025
Speaker 0: that all went fine and We all got sick.

11
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:41,219
Speaker 0: Well at least me and Scott and Emily got sick, and you know some kinds of sicknesses like When I followed all the protocols of not shaking hands.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,334
Speaker 0: I fucking didn't touch anyone.

13
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:44,140
Speaker 1: it hand wash.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,580
Speaker 0: I wash my hands every time I walk past that bathroom by panel ops, and I use the alcohol disinfectant.

15
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:51,900
Speaker 1: I don't use the disinfectant, but I wash my hands like crazy.

16
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,368
Speaker 0: Yep, but it didn't matter.

17
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,540
Speaker 0: now it appears that we actually got different things.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,188
Speaker 1: I don't like the way that shit makes your hands feel.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,579
Speaker 0: yeah, no no cuz it's all like gooey and jelly.

20
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,645
Speaker 1: yeah No, I don't like that shit.

21
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least it was.

22
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:03,220
Speaker 0: at least it was the real shit.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,084
Speaker 0: It was alcohol.

24
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:07,400
Speaker 0: It wasn't like trickles and just like came from operation Hammond.

25
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:18,159
Speaker 0: Real guys term busters, but I guess Scott got strep throat And I just got this like ridiculous fucking cold that migrated into my eye at one point.

26
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,716
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Wait I didn't get the eye thing.

27
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,308
Speaker 0: yeah I called my I called my insurance.

28
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,240
Speaker 0: cuz they have this like nurse you can call and ask questions.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:34,440
Speaker 0: And I was like so I'm an adult and I think I just got pink eye from myself And she was like you have a cold and I'm like yep, and then she's like were you coughing violently?

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,319
Speaker 0: I was like yep, and she was like you probably coughed it into your eye And I was like that's a thing and she's like that is most definitely a thing.

31
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:50,540
Speaker 0: So yeah pink eye is super contagious if you get it like Eyeword like you get it in your eye from like some kid who didn't wash his hands after poke your eye out kid yep.

32
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:59,139
Speaker 0: But if you have a cold you can cough so hard that you knock it into the back of your eye And you'll basically just get pink eye from yourself.

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:09,680
Speaker 0: so uh Normally like when I get sick with like a flu or something like that one katsu kann long ago Like we'll power through and like do a show or like do a thing especially at a convention.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,923
Speaker 0: But both of we ended up having illnesses that caused Constant coughing.

35
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:21,900
Speaker 0: so even if our mind was sound the body could not do geek nights nor could I even do any patreon stuff?

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,615
Speaker 0: So we're basically just dead in the water.

37
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:24,682
Speaker 1: also I wasn't even here.

38
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:32,190
Speaker 1: I stick because I woke up in Connecticut Monday morning planning to take the train to the city directly to work But I was sick, so I just stayed in Connecticut.

39
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, can't do a podcast from a state away.

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:40,650
Speaker 0: I'm at work on Monday and Scott messages me, and he's like you motherfucker I got me sick, and I was like wasn't me bro.

41
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:42,419
Speaker 0: I got a different sick.

42
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:43,772
Speaker 1: Well, we all got say whatever.

43
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:44,499
Speaker 0: so we're finally back.

44
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:50,487
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a lot of coughing in this episode probably and I'm not gonna edit that out cuz my cough is like 25% of what it was yesterday.

45
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:51,572
Speaker 0: yeah, no you.

46
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:53,118
Speaker 0: so Emily saw cuz.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:05,214
Speaker 0: well I thought I was feeling better like I didn't think I was sick anymore on Wednesday, so I'm playing some overwatch right and Suddenly like the game's getting intense and I start to say some stuff on the chat And then I just had this ridiculous coughing fit.

48
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:10,577
Speaker 0: so bad That one of our friends on the voice chat in the game was like rim you afk.

49
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,019
Speaker 0: What's up?

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,865
Speaker 0: Cuz I just wasn't moving.

51
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:15,578
Speaker 0: I was like flailing and coughing coughing more now that I'm talking.

52
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,744
Speaker 0: yep That's how that'll go.

53
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,707
Speaker 0: you want to cough drop.

54
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:19,751
Speaker 0: No now.

55
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:24,146
Speaker 0: I think we have some Emily's coughing out there, too Offing on the dinner the only.

56
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,540
Speaker 0: well, I don't think I can get what Emily has cuz I'm pretty sure it's what I had.

57
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:42,160
Speaker 0: But at least the party we went to over the weekend was chill times in the summer outside, so I feel pretty good rejuvenated and healing wave unrelatedly But kind of related because it's kind of funny.

58
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:50,157
Speaker 0: I promise we're not talking about American politics or any nonsense but the bad parties conventions going on right now in America.

59
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,646
Speaker 0: and Something really funny happened.

60
00:03:53,308 --> 00:04:02,948
Speaker 0: the the attendees of the Republican convention, which is like Literally the opposite of the nerd convention that we just ran Might have a norovirus outbreak.

61
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:03,189
Speaker 0: well.

62
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,039
Speaker 1: They're all old people so their health is not the greatest.

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,177
Speaker 0: now It's funny cuz on one hand is easy for disease to spread.

64
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:17,973
Speaker 0: yep But nerd conventions are known for disease spreading because like a lot more people there And there's the churn like that's why Convention Center escalators always fail.

65
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:23,900
Speaker 0: because nerds don't just walk into a room Sit there for four hours And then go out drinking in like shitty hotel bars.

66
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:27,218
Speaker 0: nerds are going up and down and up and down walking around constantly.

67
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,609
Speaker 0: tell the Conventions.

68
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,940
Speaker 1: if you look at them on TV They don't look like tech conferences where it's like a bunch of chairs and people sitting quietly.

69
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,999
Speaker 1: It's a bunch of people standing all crammed in next to each other tightly.

70
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:41,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, right push it open and yelling and I realize this and coughing on each other.

71
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,920
Speaker 0: It's a political convention, which means it's not just that they're full of flecks of spittle all over their faces.

72
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:48,289
Speaker 0: What a politicians do?

73
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,639
Speaker 0: kiss babies and shake hands.

74
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:51,006
Speaker 0: They're walking around.

75
00:04:51,046 --> 00:05:09,705
Speaker 0: this thing touching so much is so much handshaking going on there I there's a rumor that I can't confirm yet that Maybe 100% of California's delegation has norovirus, and if you don't know what norovirus is Republicans in California, there's at least two or three I assume Someone else.

76
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:13,040
Speaker 0: it was something funny because there was an uproar like there's some political nonsense going on.

77
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:32,629
Speaker 0: so a whole bunch of delegates walked out of a vote like all this like drama happened and Someone pointed out that the tweet from the news that said the Colorado delegation has abandoned the convention Was that exactly 4 20 p.m Oh That is the extent of the politics we'll get tonight.

78
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,416
Speaker 0: we're back we're bad we're doing geek nights.

79
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:35,299
Speaker 0: got any news?

80
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:46,232
Speaker 1: I do have a news the long-awaited Radio ball and a grim dark future when all he was released to the world Like a week or two ago.

81
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,359
Speaker 0: Have you played it yet?

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:56,914
Speaker 1: I bought it immediately and have not even launched it or installed it because I have not been home and not sick and At a time when I'm gonna play some video ball.

83
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,722
Speaker 0: even at a time like this We've been.

84
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:00,909
Speaker 1: why don't you really game in the winter?

85
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:04,620
Speaker 1: Why would you release your game in the warmest most beautiful time of the year?

86
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,670
Speaker 0: I mean, we've been talking about this game for what?

87
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:11,253
Speaker 0: almost three years every packs We go up to these guys and you were like just give me the game like.

88
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,473
Speaker 0: I don't just forgive me the game I want the game also.

89
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:25,535
Speaker 1: at a time It just so happens even though I'm ready to play video ball everyone that I would play video ball with is over Playing overwatch and Pokemon go and I even if I played video ball.

90
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,887
Speaker 1: No one else is video balling now Luckily there.

91
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,440
Speaker 0: It's not a fully transitive situation.

92
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:33,272
Speaker 0: You can play Pokemon go and video ball at the same time.

93
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,520
Speaker 0: you play Pokemon Pokemon goal and overwatch at the same time.

94
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:48,399
Speaker 0: You cannot play overwatch and video ball at the same time especially because the competitive season started and The let's just say the level of overwatch play is rising rapidly.

95
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:53,074
Speaker 0: I'm holding on to my 51 rank with grim determination.

96
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:54,479
Speaker 1: I'll be started on video ball.

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,420
Speaker 0: Soonish I will install video ball and play it before the end of this week.

98
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,360
Speaker 1: I think at the very least right even if video ball doesn't take off to be internet competitive.

99
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:10,619
Speaker 1: You know thing that it will at least become the best like everyone's in the same room at the party game.

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,608
Speaker 0: Oh hell yeah, in fact, it's Scott.

101
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:13,412
Speaker 0: It's kind of good.

102
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:13,814
Speaker 1: It's like.

103
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:17,700
Speaker 1: take that, you know It's like we'll have another option besides Bomberman.

104
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,151
Speaker 1: Well Bomberman and video ball.

105
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:23,674
Speaker 0: when rocket league came out Half of our friends played enough to get pretty good and the other half didn't.

106
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,522
Speaker 1: but it sucks to play rocket league in the same Room.

107
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we had it also hard, you know, it's hard people to play.

108
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,808
Speaker 0: We did it at the New Year's party But that's because we had like seven computers.

109
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:33,978
Speaker 1: that also sucks to have like a split-screen time.

110
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:34,500
Speaker 0: I didn't have that.

111
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,547
Speaker 0: I was playing my laptop.

112
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:36,171
Speaker 1: It's still.

113
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:37,379
Speaker 1: it's not but it's not the best.

114
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:44,980
Speaker 0: But the other problem was you know people got good at different rates and overwatch While it's fun to play with friends competitive kind of split off on its own both a video ball.

115
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:58,600
Speaker 0: If our friends don't play it that much it means every time we're together We bust it out and much like star wall Nobody's good enough to where no one wants to play Street Fighter or Soul Calibur with Jess or Scott anymore.

116
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,038
Speaker 1: Well, there are also times when even if everyone plays the game the same amount some people progress and skill more quickly than others.

117
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:12,020
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, anyway, I am excited though I mean, I've been waiting for video ball for a long time and it's gonna scratch an itch.

118
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,332
Speaker 0: I know it's gonna scratch an itch.

119
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,747
Speaker 1: It's the other game We've been waiting for which we talked about.

120
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:20,750
Speaker 1: last episode the Valhalla is out - we still haven't played that The cyberpunk bartending simulator.

121
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:27,400
Speaker 0: I installed it on my laptop And I was gonna play it on the way to the party this weekend because I was still a little sick.

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,690
Speaker 0: I just fell asleep instead and then the Prince of Nothing book came out.

123
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,916
Speaker 1: So that's replacing all portable gaming.

124
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,059
Speaker 1: is reading books instead?

125
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:36,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh by the way, I finished reading the book club book.

126
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,594
Speaker 0: I was about to finish reading the book club book.

127
00:08:38,614 --> 00:08:43,679
Speaker 0: Wait for some meta moment And then I read the first 60% of the Prince of Nothing book.

128
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,560
Speaker 0: I feel like I'm gonna finish the Prince of Nothing book, but I'll probably finish Orcs and Craig this weekend.

129
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,473
Speaker 1: Mmm, took me five or six hours to read it.

130
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,257
Speaker 0: Not bad.

131
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:51,699
Speaker 0: Not bad.

132
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,220
Speaker 0: My Kindle says there's only two hours left in the Prince of Nothing book.

133
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:59,358
Speaker 1: I was surprised at looking at the percentage at the bottom of the Prince of Nothing.

134
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,686
Speaker 1: as I read it I'm like really 30% already.

135
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:07,205
Speaker 0: we ready for this because I hit the whale mothers and then I looked at the percent and I was like Whoa, whoa, okay.

136
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,795
Speaker 0: Well, I know about whale mothers.

137
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,020
Speaker 0: There's not that much book left.

138
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,971
Speaker 1: I think I'm in the whale mother chapter right now.

139
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't know what the whale mothers are yet.

140
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:22,000
Speaker 0: Oh if men bred themselves the way men breed cattle, yes, it's bad stuff.

141
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,806
Speaker 0: This book is peak our Scott Packard.

142
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:28,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but why did everything we like come out literally like in the span of a few weeks?

143
00:09:29,022 --> 00:09:30,650
Speaker 1: Everyone got their shit done in August.

144
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:30,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

145
00:09:30,911 --> 00:09:33,462
Speaker 0: No get your line in February That's right.

146
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:38,740
Speaker 0: If we make a convention which we're talking about it's gonna be like middle of February on the worst.

147
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,750
Speaker 1: It's gonna be sometime fucking cold.

148
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:41,212
Speaker 0: Yep.

149
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:42,880
Speaker 0: It's gonna be cold and miserable.

150
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,239
Speaker 0: There'll be nothing going on that weekend to trust us.

151
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,157
Speaker 0: so in my news.

152
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:54,240
Speaker 0: Scott might make fun of me a little because my news is yet again overwatch, but the new patch came out.

153
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,999
Speaker 1: You'll get over it soon enough.

154
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,975
Speaker 0: Uh I'm still not over weapons factory.

155
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:06,995
Speaker 0: you realize I'm still not over tribes Like if tribes were easy to play like like this game is.

156
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:10,048
Speaker 0: I just play tribes every day Like I've been maybe even quick geek nights.

157
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,280
Speaker 0: to be a I'd wander the world's game of jet packs.

158
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:17,700
Speaker 1: There's a character Farah, but not everyone not everyone and there's that spin fuse ores.

159
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:20,053
Speaker 1: Uh doesn't have all that crazy shit.

160
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:26,863
Speaker 0: You can set up in your base Symmetra kinda Not quite to that extent but symmetric and make teleporters You can get.

161
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:32,512
Speaker 1: you can equip yourself every time you spawn with all And it's all the vehicles and everyone gets in the vehicle.

162
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,716
Speaker 0: Can't do any of that.

163
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:34,820
Speaker 1: The map is ginormous.

164
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,423
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

165
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:40,869
Speaker 0: It doesn't fully scratch the tribes eating but holy hell Does it scratch the weapons factory?

166
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,000
Speaker 0: old team fortress mega TF itch?

167
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:53,880
Speaker 0: I play this game every goddamn day but a new patch just hit and The internet was going crazy about it and you might have seen me arguing with a lot of different people about the patch.

168
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,820
Speaker 0: But the patch is interesting for a number of reasons.

169
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:05,809
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna read the patch notes because one thing you should know Scott and I were talking before the show one thing blizzards real good about is There's like this twofold balance on the one hand.

170
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,640
Speaker 0: They don't listen to you when you complain to them.

171
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:10,449
Speaker 1: Actually a little bit.

172
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,480
Speaker 1: Well the hearthstone people seem to be listening.

173
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,564
Speaker 1: They listen somewhat.

174
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:20,397
Speaker 0: they listen in the sense of they see people who are mad and they look at the game and say oh There's a problem there Let's fix it.

175
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:23,039
Speaker 0: But they don't listen to you in their lot when you're like.

176
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:27,660
Speaker 0: You should add another kind of card called this and let us make mods of the game.

177
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,507
Speaker 1: No, and they're definitely not letting.

178
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:30,832
Speaker 1: they never let anyone mod anything.

179
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:31,133
Speaker 1: blizzard.

180
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:32,840
Speaker 1: blizzard is the most anti mod, right?

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,580
Speaker 1: They go after anyone who sets up their own server.

182
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,907
Speaker 0: And I'm telling you I used to be super pro mod.

183
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:47,014
Speaker 0: the only reason I am NOT anymore is because of tribes - But the other thing is that blizzard when they do make changes I'm pro.

184
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,194
Speaker 1: I'm pro mod in terms of the kind of mod where it's like we made this brand new game using your engine Right without having to buy your stupid engine like counter-strike.

185
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,141
Speaker 1: But I'm not pro mod Like.

186
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:02,280
Speaker 1: we made a different counter-strike get zombie counter-strike and now half the people are playing zombie counter-strike.

187
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,960
Speaker 0: The worst thing about your example, is that zombie counter-strike was almost fun like it was probably the best of those.

188
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:12,500
Speaker 0: Did you ever play World of Warcraft counter-strike?

189
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,567
Speaker 1: I'm also pro mod in terms of like.

190
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:22,680
Speaker 0: hey, let me make a custom map for this game like FYI swirled Yep, or sieve five like let's just make the entire Prince of Nothing world into a scenario.

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,363
Speaker 0: I was my.

192
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,246
Speaker 1: that was my idea.

193
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,230
Speaker 0: It was we.

194
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,540
Speaker 1: uh, we're just as long as you admit that it was my idea.

195
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,086
Speaker 0: I should just post that chat you had.

196
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,557
Speaker 0: uh, was it your idea or did I incept it into you?

197
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,220
Speaker 0: What came before?

198
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:33,445
Speaker 1: I came before.

199
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:36,158
Speaker 0: Well, actually we have a chat log and you'll see exactly what came before.

200
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:36,640
Speaker 1: Yeah me.

201
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,407
Speaker 0: But so the one thing is there here's.

202
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:43,300
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read some of these change notes because blizzard goes into a lot of detail.

203
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:57,390
Speaker 0: If a match goes into overtime for more than 20 seconds, the overtime fuse will now burn down much more quickly Mmm, so if a match doesn't end definitively at the end of its time it goes into overtime.

204
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,681
Speaker 0: the way over time basically works is they'll be like an objective of some Kind.

205
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:05,494
Speaker 0: so like one example is there's a payload that is to get to a destination by a time.

206
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:15,468
Speaker 0: if the time runs out and the Payload is not yet at the destination the people pushing the payload lose, but the payload is still moving Because the the attackers are still on it.

207
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:24,974
Speaker 0: then over time starts and as long as they stay on the payload The overtime goes on forever, but the moment they're off the payload.

208
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,899
Speaker 0: There's this cow overtime fuse that just goes.

209
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,027
Speaker 1: So it's 20 seconds, right.

210
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:31,110
Speaker 1: so it basically allows you.

211
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,206
Speaker 0: if like well, no, it's 20 seconds from the point you are not Advancing it any further.

212
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:39,720
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm saying it's like it's basically allows for the buzzer beater situation.

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,068
Speaker 1: We're like, we almost made it.

214
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,000
Speaker 1: We don't want to just get cut off like you're one.

215
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:56,680
Speaker 0: You could spend the whole match at the beginning of them of the thing Like you're like way away from the objective hit overtime And if you just never get knocked off of that thing, you'll eventually take it over the finish line in a win.

216
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:12,224
Speaker 0: It works great But what they're doing is if they over time goes on for more than 20 seconds total The fuse that determines whether or not it can keep going will start burning down faster and faster and faster to force a conclusion which is good because The ice.

217
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:27,046
Speaker 0: I saw some players and I did this a few times who had strategies that Involved getting into overtime and delaying the game for a very long time like six mays can't lose a Competitive play.

218
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,134
Speaker 0: Oh, oh.

219
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:31,588
Speaker 0: and also in overtime Respawn times are increased.

220
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:32,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, that makes sense.

221
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:33,455
Speaker 0: So think about this.

222
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:36,004
Speaker 0: That means in overtime It kills someone.

223
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:36,947
Speaker 1: you're gonna win like.

224
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,011
Speaker 0: that's a big deal.

225
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,619
Speaker 0: killing someone matters a lot surviving matters a lot.

226
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,241
Speaker 1: Sure That's good.

227
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:51,043
Speaker 0: The change that everyone's bitching about is and I was bitching too, and I'm very Conflicted and ambivalent on the change in competitive play Matches.

228
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,080
Speaker 0: you can only have one of each hero per team.

229
00:14:54,962 --> 00:15:04,504
Speaker 0: So that would be like if in weapons factory you could only have on your team one sniper one engineer one arsonist one Whatever.

230
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,814
Speaker 0: healer nurse nurse was the class.

231
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:24,440
Speaker 0: and on one hand I don't like that because I do enjoy the strategies people came up with like in certain maps just have two sentry turrets fucking go Nuts, but on the other hand I can see that if you allow Heroes to be doubled up because every hero has like a crazy dune style power.

232
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:37,711
Speaker 0: Then if you make one hero a little bit too strong in a certain situation You could theoretically have a degenerate strategy in certain maps of yeah Just fucking send six Winston's in and nothing beats that but six maze.

233
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:41,340
Speaker 1: I mean limiting options is usually good, right?

234
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,119
Speaker 0: It's like, you know Well, it's good for balance.

235
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:53,680
Speaker 1: If you think of like the set of players you have on the set of classes you choose on an FPS team as Like the cards in a in a collectible card game.

236
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:58,620
Speaker 1: It's like you can't just let someone make a deck of like eight lightning bolts and then turn it into a deck of eight.

237
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,393
Speaker 1: You know restore health or whatever right when they need health.

238
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:02,900
Speaker 1: It's like that's you know, it's bullshit, right?

239
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,240
Speaker 1: It's like yeah choose one of everything, you know at any given time.

240
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,960
Speaker 1: I'm surprised they didn't actually take it further and do the thing the mobas do or you deny.

241
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:12,886
Speaker 1: And it's only.

242
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:21,180
Speaker 1: it's like if someone when you pick something you're that for the whole game and Only one person and as soon as one team takes a class the other team can't pick it.

243
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,602
Speaker 1: You know what?

244
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:25,760
Speaker 0: They appear to have been floating some of those ideas, but honestly I don't ruin the game.

245
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,865
Speaker 1: I think it works in mobas because they have so many classes that if someone like takes one support There's always another support you can get.

246
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:38,715
Speaker 1: it's not like they can ever ban you from getting any healers whatsoever unless you really mess It up, but I don't think overwatch while it has a lot.

247
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:39,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't have enough yet.

248
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:47,467
Speaker 0: Also overwatch is more like make your team of six with your strategy for those six people Irrespective of the other side.

249
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:50,580
Speaker 0: It's more like hockey and less like a MOBA in that regard.

250
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,640
Speaker 0: Like this is my team as your team.

251
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,260
Speaker 1: No, like counter picking like ah, they picked that person.

252
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,204
Speaker 1: So we need to pick this.

253
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:59,960
Speaker 0: in fact, you can't see who they pick until you see them in game.

254
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:05,762
Speaker 1: Well, they could let you see right they can let you see, you know They could if they built the MOBA like character selection system They would like.

255
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:14,068
Speaker 0: I'm saying right now you can't right but what it means is, you know to use the hockey analogy Because you can change characters during the match Like yeah, that's another thing as he can't do.

256
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:19,026
Speaker 0: that is great because that is like a hockey line change Yeah, and it works really well.

257
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,776
Speaker 0: So I'm really ambivalent on the change.

258
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:24,526
Speaker 0: I Suspect in the end.

259
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:28,480
Speaker 0: now they gave some additional notes as to why they made the change and the chain.

260
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,040
Speaker 1: I'll just make the game more interesting.

261
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:31,363
Speaker 0: Yeah It does so.

262
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:33,351
Speaker 0: the here's the pros and cons.

263
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,660
Speaker 0: the pros of the change seem to be one.

264
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,421
Speaker 0: It's easier to balance heroes Like.

265
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:42,760
Speaker 0: they can try crazy stuff with a hero and they can test it much more easily for balance, right?

266
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,103
Speaker 1: If there's some ridiculously powerful hero That's like Opie.

267
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:50,540
Speaker 1: each team will have one at most and that's it and you can balance around that and you won't have these boring games.

268
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,948
Speaker 1: So it's like oh we made a hero Opie.

269
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:53,798
Speaker 1: Both teams are six of the same here all the time.

270
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,335
Speaker 1: Oops You know, you just save yourself from that.

271
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:06,993
Speaker 0: Yep But the main complaint seemed to be that competitive players are whiny little babies who are complaining That it was really hard to counter certain strategies on certain maps.

272
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,040
Speaker 0: they didn't appear to be completely degenerate.

273
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,328
Speaker 0: It's just baby's got to get good.

274
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:14,900
Speaker 1: Well also, yeah, it's hard to counter certain strategies in certain maps.

275
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:22,411
Speaker 1: But now those other people can't use those strategies because they also have to have six unique heroes Yep, and they can't come at you with six of the same guy.

276
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,640
Speaker 1: You don't need six of the other guy to stop them.

277
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,126
Speaker 1: They only have.

278
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:29,740
Speaker 0: you know, it's like come on But like there were some maps word, but then here's there's my counterpoint on the other side.

279
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:49,928
Speaker 0: When this wasn't a thing especially in casual play you'd see these amazing spectator moments Where the crazy bullshit goes down like a team's losing and losing and suddenly they just kind of get desperate and six winstons just burst onto the scene and go crazy go literally apeshit and It was real fun.

280
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,700
Speaker 0: It's like when the crazy crap like the onside kick nonsense happens.

281
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why this rules only in competitive mode.

282
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,118
Speaker 1: Hearthstone did the same thing.

283
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:56,380
Speaker 1: Hearthstone.

284
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:02,894
Speaker 1: They have you know, they have competitive mode, which is like standard mode and they also have wild mode Which is like play all the crazy cards.

285
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:07,051
Speaker 0: Whoo Now I do think I suspect.

286
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:19,792
Speaker 0: now again, I do not know the math I don't have any of the stats that Blizzard has I Suspect they could have gotten away with doing actually the thing that weapons factory did back in the day Cuz weapons factory the most recent game.

287
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:25,460
Speaker 0: that's like this game And what they did is all the people who ran servers sort of converged upon.

288
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:30,336
Speaker 0: So certain classes were limited to a limited number and others weren't.

289
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:31,600
Speaker 1: yeah another way of doing this.

290
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:40,720
Speaker 1: That's just too complicated for real-time Switching is just use a points based system Like each class is worth X points and your team can only have X points on the field at a time.

291
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:42,347
Speaker 1: But it's like imagine respawning.

292
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:43,552
Speaker 1: I mean, I have to choose a class.

293
00:19:43,973 --> 00:19:45,500
Speaker 1: There's only 20 points available.

294
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:51,880
Speaker 1: I want a class that cost 22. could someone else die and respond to something that cost to last so I can switch to the?

295
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:52,968
Speaker 1: You know, it's like that.

296
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,400
Speaker 1: it's like fuck that nonsense, right?

297
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,940
Speaker 1: But yeah, but that's a good system other than that obvious problem.

298
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,000
Speaker 1: If you were if you were like planning at the start of the game like building a miniature, you know, then it would be fine.

299
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,360
Speaker 0: Yep, but I remember weapons back.

300
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,245
Speaker 0: I remember the full details just been so long.

301
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:16,600
Speaker 0: but like Gunner was like Bastion is an overwatch and most servers said only two Gunners Only two engineers because like six turrets in a room in a 10v10 was just unbeatable.

302
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,526
Speaker 0: So they do that sort of thing.

303
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,575
Speaker 0: I hope in the in the long run.

304
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,340
Speaker 0: That's what ends up happening.

305
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,302
Speaker 0: I'd like to see a little bit of hero stacking because it really adds to the strategic depth I think.

306
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:31,860
Speaker 1: I think that all they really need to do to solve that is to just do like I said with the MOBAs.

307
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:35,640
Speaker 0: Right, if you want it, for example, I do not want to see a lot of heroes in this game.

308
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,560
Speaker 0: Like I don't want is I was gonna be a lot of heroes.

309
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,532
Speaker 0: Hey, I don't think they'll be hundreds cuz they're going real.

310
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:40,760
Speaker 1: I don't know if they'll be hundreds.

311
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,440
Speaker 1: But for example, like you want more engineers right that because you want more than one turret, right?

312
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:45,962
Speaker 1: So they'll just.

313
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:47,269
Speaker 0: they already have two kinds of turrets.

314
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:54,345
Speaker 1: I'm just saying they'll make a Yet another class that has some kind of engineer, you know, that's different than the other ones But still right.

315
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:56,520
Speaker 1: and that's how you would get to stacking, right?

316
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,105
Speaker 0: I just don't think they'll add too many heroes over time partly because the game in all games they've had so far they've kept adding heroes.

317
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:12,033
Speaker 0: true, but this is a very different kind of game because of the player skill input and Unlike those MOBAs even the Pareto frontier in this game is fucking tight.

318
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:14,700
Speaker 1: I sure but I'm saying expect new heroes.

319
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,439
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but they're the rate of hero adding.

320
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,998
Speaker 1: Expect multiple heroes multiple heroes per year.

321
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,367
Speaker 0: Well, well, I don't know.

322
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:24,694
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll be multiple per year.

323
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,760
Speaker 1: It'll be multiple per year.

324
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,688
Speaker 0: I may be at most two a year.

325
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:29,596
Speaker 1: No, it's gonna be way more to be at least five.

326
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:30,279
Speaker 0: I don't know.

327
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:32,006
Speaker 0: We'll see.

328
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:32,954
Speaker 1: that's how they do.

329
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:38,599
Speaker 0: in the very least They'll never charge you for heroes But if they do it if they do it a lot of charging 50 bucks for the game So they better fucking not charge it.

330
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,699
Speaker 0: The problem will be if they had too many heroes the game will turn into a MOBA where that knowledge matrix starts to matter a lot.

331
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:55,212
Speaker 0: and Also, it means that teams tactical composition changes are so much more subtle and less obvious to spectators that the game will basically turn into A MOBA and I'd quit playing it.

332
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:55,799
Speaker 1: That's how they do.

333
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if that happens, I'll quit.

334
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,021
Speaker 0: but it's not doesn't appear to be happening Now.

335
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:03,496
Speaker 0: the player the characters are all all true dick and super skill based.

336
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:04,600
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of other changes

337
00:22:05,102 --> 00:22:15,540
Speaker 1: But I mean it'll be slower than adding heroes to their actual MOBA because it takes a lot more work to make one For an FPS, you know all you got to make all these weapons and models and animations and stuff that you know.

338
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,467
Speaker 1: They're bigger and they're fancier.

339
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:21,020
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna add more modes and more maps first.

340
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,510
Speaker 1: They're definitely gonna do that for sure because also I noticed something the character they added unlike the MOBA's that I'll have like one map Right.

341
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:30,839
Speaker 0: Yep Well, actually I'll get into that later because we got other stuff to talk about and this will be a real long news.

342
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,160
Speaker 0: if I talk About everything else is going on here.

343
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:41,479
Speaker 0: But the the most important change I play diva a lot Like I'm real good with diva and I stopped playing diva because it felt kind of overpowered to me And I wanted to get better at other classes.

344
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:47,160
Speaker 0: They just made diva way more powerful because everyone else thought that character was underpowered.

345
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:54,740
Speaker 0: So I'm already like real fucking dangerous with that character and now they just made her like twice as powerful.

346
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:56,603
Speaker 0: I'm real curious.

347
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,466
Speaker 0: What's gonna happen if I start using her again.

348
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:07,767
Speaker 0: So anyway things Of the day got a thing of the day.

349
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:13,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, some dude got some Legos and he made with those Legos a gentleman's club.

350
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:22,586
Speaker 1: Yeah Ricks bricks bricks all shapes and sizes and while you know a gentleman's club is in itself rather distasteful This is funny.

351
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:24,515
Speaker 0: It looks a lot like show palace.

352
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:33,464
Speaker 1: Yeah Like specifically it's quite low brow, but it has all these Lego jokes and ah, but I'm quite low brow It's it's well constructed.

353
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:37,134
Speaker 0: So so a multiple people sent this to me.

354
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,260
Speaker 0: This is called hyper reality.

355
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:48,700
Speaker 0: Uh presents a provocative and kaleidoscopic new vision of the future where physical and virtual rallies emerge in a city saturated in media.

356
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,948
Speaker 0: This is basically now.

357
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:52,955
Speaker 0: I couldn't find it because I forgot it was called.

358
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,300
Speaker 0: I couldn't remember who showed it to me.

359
00:23:54,823 --> 00:24:14,160
Speaker 0: so eventually I just typed into Google and I was like Dystopian augmented reality and this is literally the first thing that came up, but it is a video that's like a first-person view of a human being living in a Pretty likely future of what augmented reality is actually gonna be like in the real world.

360
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,313
Speaker 1: But I mean we've seen stuff like this a million times before.

361
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,339
Speaker 1: what's different about this one?

362
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,823
Speaker 0: I like what name one.

363
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,351
Speaker 1: Well, there's like the dental coil anime.

364
00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:23,318
Speaker 0: No coil is a lot different from this.

365
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:29,031
Speaker 0: Yes Superficially, here's a future where augmented reality exists.

366
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,859
Speaker 1: Blade Runner every single cyberpunk thing ever.

367
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:36,073
Speaker 0: So Blade Runner doesn't say any of the things really that this says.

368
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:38,669
Speaker 0: Blade Runner also wasn't really focused on AR at all.

369
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:40,600
Speaker 0: Mmm Blade Runner.

370
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:52,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right Scott there are works of media that Superficially cover the same broad spectrum of just someone walking around is like ads in their face all the time.

371
00:24:53,522 --> 00:24:55,487
Speaker 0: That is one tiny aspect of this.

372
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:56,208
Speaker 0: Also.

373
00:24:56,268 --> 00:25:11,130
Speaker 0: What is very different about this is that it is very well constructed and has a deep variety of very Specific and subtle details that really drive home the Terrifying reality of this sort of future.

374
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,620
Speaker 0: the moral is always block ads.

375
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:18,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, always always always block ads and every every aspect of your life block ads.

376
00:25:18,454 --> 00:25:19,638
Speaker 0: hundred years block ads.

377
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,491
Speaker 1: calm You wanna play gods?

378
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:27,940
Speaker 0: Yeah In the moment, the booklet book is Oryx and Crick by Margaret Atwood read the whole thing.

379
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,949
Speaker 1: It took me like five six hours tops.

380
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,746
Speaker 0: I'm gonna finish the Prince of Nothing book and then this weekend I'll probably read Oryx and Crick.

381
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:43,246
Speaker 1: So I already picked like the next two book club books and Apparently Oryx and Crick has like two sequels and those are not the next book club picks even though it's apparently you're supposed to read Them.

382
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:46,027
Speaker 1: Yep I didn't even realize that that was a trilogy.

383
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:52,972
Speaker 0: until many of our friends when they're when they find out that we're reading this book For the book club are like, oh you got to read the other two.

384
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:53,858
Speaker 1: I'm like other two.

385
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:54,240
Speaker 1: What?

386
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,333
Speaker 1: Even though I finished it at that point.

387
00:25:56,414 --> 00:26:03,305
Speaker 1: I was like, oh Okay that you just turn the ending from a non cliffhanger into a cliffhanger That there was more.

388
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:11,911
Speaker 0: see remember the only reason I read all 14 of those Wheel of Time books plus new spring Was that I knew that series was already done.

389
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,060
Speaker 0: There'd never be any more and the original author was dead.

390
00:26:14,962 --> 00:26:15,203
Speaker 0: I will.

391
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,268
Speaker 0: I basically don't start things that I don't trust.

392
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,096
Speaker 0: might that I do not trust you end reliably.

393
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:21,239
Speaker 1: you're reading Prince of Nothing.

394
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:27,715
Speaker 0: then Based on how those books are going He knows how it's going to end and he's likely to survive to finish them.

395
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:28,600
Speaker 0: and there aren't that many more.

396
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:36,572
Speaker 0: There's gonna be way less news tomorrow if our Scott Packard dies Before the book after the one I'm reading right now comes out.

397
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:40,170
Speaker 0: I'm going to be distraught let us put it that way.

398
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:47,920
Speaker 0: but I think the the Danger of that is much lower than with say the awful Game of Thrones books that I really have zero interest in reading.

399
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, no fuck those.

400
00:26:49,426 --> 00:26:57,860
Speaker 0: Yep in other news now that Connecticut is done All that content that's been kind of on hold for a long time is coming back full force.

401
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,206
Speaker 0: Scott's gonna make a bunch of videos.

402
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:00,753
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a bunch of videos.

403
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,340
Speaker 0: got a ton of things for the patreon.

404
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:05,053
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of panels from other conventions.

405
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:10,983
Speaker 0: I got to upload to YouTube geek nights presents who 10 of 15 is like 90% done.

406
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:17,502
Speaker 0: all this shit is a creative explosion is gonna come out dependent only upon how nice it is outside Mm-hmm.

407
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:29,917
Speaker 0: And also we are going to be officially Appearing live at PAX West not PAX prime West 2016 on a prime and a living in capstone at the end getting help from physical plant physical plant.

408
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:32,071
Speaker 0: and I'm using my fire My Phoenix browser.

409
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:37,059
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm gonna play some tennis on my Nintendo revolution.

410
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:45,971
Speaker 0: But we are performing Saturday September 3rd at 5 p.m.

411
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,820
Speaker 0: In the chicken theater the grind.

412
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:54,780
Speaker 0: We're doing an hour-long lecture on the very concept of grinding in games.

413
00:27:55,165 --> 00:28:00,000
Speaker 0: at its core It's been you know, we do a lot of panels a lot of lectures of cons.

414
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:09,128
Speaker 0: But I do want to say this because this one's gonna be More like panels we did many years ago in that We're excited like really excited about it.

415
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,178
Speaker 0: as soon as Scott had the idea cuz he I was like, what about grinding?

416
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:17,300
Speaker 0: and I was like Oh, oh and then we both had already like four hours worth of shit to talk.

417
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:20,340
Speaker 1: So if anyone get out there, I want you to help us do some research.

418
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:25,058
Speaker 1: I want you to find us the earliest examples of grinding that in gaming that you can follow.

419
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,113
Speaker 0: in gaming I was about to say being a peasant right, but I mean like, you know, I found like.

420
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:33,950
Speaker 1: there's some old-ass RPGs obviously But like is there anything older than the oldest RPGs?

421
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,920
Speaker 0: We have to level up and yeah, there's no grinding in Kriegsfield.

422
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,462
Speaker 1: I mean like.

423
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:38,887
Speaker 1: grinding is old.

424
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,894
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy 1 was not the first.

425
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:42,760
Speaker 0: now you might be saying but rim and Scott.

426
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,780
Speaker 0: What do you mean by grinding?

427
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:45,765
Speaker 0: There's some wonderful threads.

428
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,014
Speaker 1: I think you can get an idea of what grinding means.

429
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can figure it out But there are a lot like.

430
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,000
Speaker 0: grinding serves purposes in games.

431
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,466
Speaker 0: This is not gonna be a lecture of.

432
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:57,280
Speaker 0: here's all the reasons why grinding is bad and why grinding sucks the end.

433
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,882
Speaker 1: Let's go home.

434
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, no grinding serves its purpose.

435
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:01,257
Speaker 0: Grinding is a good thing.

436
00:29:01,277 --> 00:29:01,960
Speaker 0: in some games.

437
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:03,348
Speaker 0: There's different kinds of grind.

438
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,576
Speaker 0: this I'm just.

439
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:05,160
Speaker 0: I'm feeling it.

440
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:16,831
Speaker 0: This is gonna be more like that dude, bro Like those old lectures we used to do because I don't know that clocks ring and I feel good about this one Because I've noticed the lectures that we really really like.

441
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:21,845
Speaker 0: we basically do like twice at conventions and The second time we do it.

442
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:27,559
Speaker 0: that video is what we put on YouTube and it's just perfect and we never run it anywhere again Because the perfect versions on YouTube.

443
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:30,660
Speaker 0: But then we got lazy for a while cuz we've been busy.

444
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:34,360
Speaker 0: So we'll take like one panel and run it at like eight conventions.

445
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,450
Speaker 0: I feel like this one might be a one and done on YouTube.

446
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:38,093
Speaker 0: Hmm.

447
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,622
Speaker 0: See I'm playing Babe Ruth in it Pointing.

448
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:41,586
Speaker 0: I think this one's gonna be good.

449
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:45,017
Speaker 0: Whatever also packs is five four days six.

450
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:49,875
Speaker 0: if you go to dev I'm gonna be there for all six days and it's gonna be amazing.

451
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:56,395
Speaker 0: I Don't think we have any conventions after that until mag fest good, which we'll be performing at.

452
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:57,719
Speaker 0: and yeah.

453
00:29:58,562 --> 00:30:05,820
Speaker 0: So speaking of you know, those kinds of lectures there was a panel we did at a PAX a long goddamn time ago.

454
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:10,941
Speaker 0: This was like PAX Prime 2010 or it might have been like East 2011.

455
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:15,236
Speaker 1: the thing we said at this panel was we've been saying much longer.

456
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,992
Speaker 0: well before we did that Yeah, but they culminated in this panel.

457
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:25,032
Speaker 0: We called the panel egregiously unrealized potential and we were like Why doesn't someone remake tie fighter like we?

458
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,740
Speaker 0: just all these things like why doesn't someone do this?

459
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,698
Speaker 0: Why doesn't someone do that?

460
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,780
Speaker 0: And then we talked about like why the remake of bionic commando From the NES was way better than the game that it was made to promote and all that nonsense.

461
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:42,655
Speaker 0: But then at the very end our last slide was just Pokemon Pokemon MMO.

462
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:43,397
Speaker 0: Let's fucking do it.

463
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:44,420
Speaker 0: It'll end the world.

464
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:46,189
Speaker 0: It'll be the most important thing ever like.

465
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:47,255
Speaker 0: it'll change everything.

466
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:54,540
Speaker 1: and we were right Yeah, they're also right when I said that Pokemon go is just gonna be ingress of the Pokemon skin on it.

467
00:30:54,761 --> 00:31:01,538
Speaker 0: So I'd listen to because we talked about ingress on geek nights when it came out and we you know We played a whole bunch, which is why I feel no need to play Pokemon.

468
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,843
Speaker 0: Yeah But we played ingress a lot because it was the first one that played it a moderate amount.

469
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:13,360
Speaker 0: we played it a bunch for a short span of time to be able to Understand it because it was the first modern AR game.

470
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,231
Speaker 1: No, the first modern AR game was that thing that EA did in 2001.

471
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:20,473
Speaker 1: That was I don't argue No, I said you and called you on the phone.

472
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:21,540
Speaker 0: I know what you're talking about.

473
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:23,348
Speaker 0: I think that's a different class of air again.

474
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:25,960
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's that's that's even more AR than yeah.

475
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:32,474
Speaker 1: But that's why I said modern AR also Pokemon go Only a little bit of AR going on.

476
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:33,720
Speaker 1: It's mostly just Jeep.

477
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:36,068
Speaker 1: It's mostly just a game that has GPS in.

478
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:39,260
Speaker 1: that's the very definition of AR that it has a GPS.

479
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,209
Speaker 0: It's overlaid on the real world in your real life.

480
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,359
Speaker 0: There's there's physical things in your alter.

481
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,348
Speaker 1: Your reality isn't altered by Scott and you're playing.

482
00:31:46,369 --> 00:32:00,518
Speaker 0: but AR AR game like version one would have been when people Told a story about a place in a novel and that Think about the things the novel said about that place.

483
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:06,785
Speaker 0: Version two would have been like geocaching But whatever.

484
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:14,000
Speaker 0: anyway, when you talked about ingress we both said Multiple times that this is the model.

485
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,729
Speaker 0: This is the blueprint for a real AR game down the road.

486
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,894
Speaker 0: Like this is clearly just a candy box.

487
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:24,540
Speaker 0: This is Google through Niantic Experimenting with this concept.

488
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:29,353
Speaker 0: It's like the beta test that they're gonna use this data to make a real game later.

489
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:31,900
Speaker 0: and then a while ago years ago.

490
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,526
Speaker 0: Was it years ago?

491
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:33,899
Speaker 0: was a while ago at least a year ago.

492
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:42,883
Speaker 0: but remember when one day Pokemon just appeared in Google Maps for a day and then they disappeared like just there were Pokemon in places around the world and you could Yeah, poke up.

493
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:57,795
Speaker 0: Nintendo and Google have been pretty tight with Pokemon and stuff for quite a while They've been friendly to each other when that happened that one day I was like, there's a Pidgeotto just on Google Maps and I clicked on it and now I have a Pidgeotto.

494
00:32:58,236 --> 00:32:59,399
Speaker 0: and then like we talked about it.

495
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:20,799
Speaker 0: but what one thing that I said in that geek nights was It's interesting because that means that Google and Nintendo Talked to each other and made that happen like Roger Rabbit style including characters of multiple properties Which meant Google and Pokemon were talking or Google and Nintendo were talking and we basically predicted that this was gonna

496
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:21,120
Speaker 1: happen.

497
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:27,395
Speaker 0: Yeah physical plant Mm-hmm, and sure enough we were right 100% it happened.

498
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:28,118
Speaker 0: and here it is.

499
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:32,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we talked about it when it was announced and now it's here except the wristband thing isn't here yet.

500
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,181
Speaker 1: Yep, the race is exactly what we said It would be.

501
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:43,176
Speaker 1: yep, and it's interesting because it changed all those people who were like, oh man, you know, they kept saying stuff It wasn't gonna be and I told them they were wrong and they didn't believe me.

502
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:46,798
Speaker 1: They're like, oh, yeah There's gonna be like battling and I'm like, no there isn't and we were right there isn't.

503
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:50,491
Speaker 0: well There sort of is but not regular not really not the way that they were thinking.

504
00:33:50,792 --> 00:34:00,334
Speaker 0: now, it's interesting because Nintendo they've said Features will come and they have said specifically Trading and all those other things are going to come.

505
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:06,045
Speaker 1: and the people are also like, oh, yeah You'll be able to get Pokemon and bring them into your Gameboy game and I'm like, nope That's never gonna happen.

506
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:09,639
Speaker 0: I think some of those things might happen down the road, but not all of them.

507
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:11,266
Speaker 0: Here's my prediction.

508
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:28,657
Speaker 0: I think Pokemon go is going to be kept like Studiosly separate from the real Pokemon games for the foreseeable future in the sense that None of the companies involved will ever let Pokemon Bago Cannibalize even one sale of a regular Pokemon game.

509
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,600
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And that is that is not on the table.

510
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:37,670
Speaker 1: All they want to do is use Pokemon go to boost the sales of regular Pokemon and vice versa Which I think they're going to very well.

511
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:47,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also think When the inevitable happens and Nintendo is no longer a hardware company Maybe maybe not like well very likely someday that'll happen.

512
00:34:48,061 --> 00:35:01,330
Speaker 0: But when there's no hardware anymore or Nintendo the other option is Nintendo might go the oculus road and start making Increasingly specialized hardware, but like we you not the greatest thing in the world Like there's a reason we don't just want to play Mario maker.

513
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,174
Speaker 1: I don't play anything else.

514
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:04,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, and remember the big game I wanted to play on?

515
00:35:04,223 --> 00:35:05,226
Speaker 0: it was actually Splatoon.

516
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:07,414
Speaker 0: No overwatch like Splatoon is dead.

517
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:10,447
Speaker 1: I don't I never needed to place Look, it's a real good game.

518
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:11,934
Speaker 1: I'm sure but it's better.

519
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,200
Speaker 1: I don't need I don't need that in my life.

520
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:23,305
Speaker 0: I did need it in my life but it wasn't worth owning a Wii U to have and the fact that it's basically dead now in light of overwatch means I was correct, but Pokemon go.

521
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:40,960
Speaker 0: if Nintendo stops being a hardware company and goes the way of Sega and Start selling like regular Pokemon games like on Steam or on other consoles or just on phones Then the great singularity will happen with Pokemon go but only then.

522
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,707
Speaker 0: It's unlikely.

523
00:35:42,889 --> 00:35:44,140
Speaker 1: don't hold your breath for that one.

524
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:49,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly That is a distant future that requires a lot of different dominoes to fall over.

525
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:54,632
Speaker 1: So since I knew exactly what it was gonna be and it turned out to be right I never even bothered to play Pokemon go.

526
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,639
Speaker 1: have you played Pokemon go?

527
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,736
Speaker 0: I played it but I did play ingress all the way up to level 8 to really like.

528
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:02,000
Speaker 1: see I played it.

529
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,952
Speaker 1: I don't even know what level I'd have to log in and find out.

530
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:06,728
Speaker 0: but I got to level 8 just because that was the highest level in the game when it came out.

531
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:08,499
Speaker 0: and then they added 8 more levels.

532
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,689
Speaker 0: and There's a fact and what I noticed this is the prayer.

533
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,840
Speaker 0: the most interesting thing about Pokemon go that's happening right now.

534
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:22,619
Speaker 0: social media People who are playing the game notice How much experience you need to get past?

535
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,247
Speaker 0: Some level in the in the future.

536
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:30,700
Speaker 0: like if you play it you get to like level 14 or whatever like to get to the next Level you need a lot of experience.

537
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:39,005
Speaker 0: They realize that it's basically an exponential curve of the amount of experience you need to continue advancing The same way.

538
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:42,417
Speaker 0: it was like to get to level 2. you need like one experience.

539
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:43,240
Speaker 0: fucking just did happen.

540
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,046
Speaker 0: You're already level 2.

541
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:48,320
Speaker 0: Yeah to get to like level 4 It's like alright you need like a hundred to get to level 8.

542
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,453
Speaker 0: It's like you need a thousand to get a level 9.

543
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:51,680
Speaker 0: It's like you need a billion.

544
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:01,950
Speaker 0: All candy box games must have Exponential progression or they will fail.

545
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:09,440
Speaker 1: if you have linear progression people just keep progressing like whoop whoop Yep, and they don't feel and then you can't really get away from anyone.

546
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,099
Speaker 1: So it doesn't really feel good to be high level because everyone's high level.

547
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,139
Speaker 0: Yep, because you remember there is no cost to you to level up in Pokemon go except you keep clicking.

548
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:23,772
Speaker 0: But if you just keep poking at the game, you'll just keep leveling up.

549
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:41,499
Speaker 0: So the only way to make that Monetizable and to make sure that levels matter in some way is to make that leveling curve be to the point that even crazy Joey Jojo Shabadoo who plays this game 24 hours a day seven days a week Eventually Peters out and hits a vertical line.

550
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:47,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need to separate Joey Jojo from the non Shabadoo version right at least by one level.

551
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:48,979
Speaker 1: So you need to have that gap there.

552
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:55,399
Speaker 0: But also the game is competitive, but it's competitive in the same way that ingress is.

553
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,041
Speaker 0: in fact It's even.

554
00:37:56,061 --> 00:38:03,569
Speaker 1: I've spent more time on the game than you and there's more people who on my team color living in this area than I mean, basically the way it works is it.

555
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:10,100
Speaker 0: they added a few things that make it objectively way better than ingress But they took some ingress concepts and super fucking dumbed him down.

556
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:15,140
Speaker 0: So ingress has the portals and you like have to team up with people and like collaborate to connect them together.

557
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:17,125
Speaker 0: All that teamwork is gone.

558
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,233
Speaker 0: Like teamwork doesn't mean anything in this game.

559
00:38:19,273 --> 00:38:21,200
Speaker 0: Really like the team you're on fuck it.

560
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,449
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter like who cares also everyone.

561
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,814
Speaker 1: art is also no green team.

562
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:34,541
Speaker 0: Everyone smarts on the blue team Because the blue team is like we're gonna learn about stuff and the red team is like we're gonna be strong and the yellow team Is.

563
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:35,927
Speaker 0: don't trust science.

564
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:36,810
Speaker 0: go with your gut.

565
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:38,155
Speaker 1: fuck you yellow team.

566
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:39,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the yellow team is Hufflepuff.

567
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,250
Speaker 1: Fuck you yellow team so much.

568
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,180
Speaker 0: I mean, I really wanted to be Team Rocket.

569
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,960
Speaker 0: I feel like I could still be Team Rocket.

570
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:45,665
Speaker 0: All I have to do

571
00:38:45,746 --> 00:38:47,943
Speaker 1: green team or Team Rocket should be the teams but they're

572
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:59,031
Speaker 0: not all you have to do to be Team Rocket is Place a Pokemon lure at night and then hide in that place and when kids show up playing Pokemon Literally run over punch them out steal their phones steal their Pokemon.

573
00:38:59,131 --> 00:38:59,712
Speaker 1: steal the fuck.

574
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:00,615
Speaker 0: think about it.

575
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:02,340
Speaker 0: Team Rocket could be real.

576
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:07,498
Speaker 0: You can literally mug a kid and steal his real Team Rocket cosplay.

577
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:10,129
Speaker 1: come out do the thing The kids be like, yeah, and then steal their Pokemon.

578
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you're like, no really kid.

579
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:11,615
Speaker 0: Give me your.

580
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:12,640
Speaker 0: give me your fucking Pokemon.

581
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:13,904
Speaker 0: I'm taking that Pikachu.

582
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:15,608
Speaker 0: No, no, give me the phone.

583
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:17,735
Speaker 0: I'm gonna Brian gonna break your phone and kill your Pikachu.

584
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,819
Speaker 0: I Feel like this has got to happen.

585
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:32,291
Speaker 0: But anyway, so instead of all that portals stuff with the connecting together and the shields and the stuff pokestops you basically go up to them and You have to literally like click on the screen.

586
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,040
Speaker 1: one seriously in a pokestop in a gym.

587
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:36,368
Speaker 0: So a pokestop is an ingress portal.

588
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:44,119
Speaker 0: you walk up to it and you got to go into the screen and you see the circle That shows like what the thing is that you don't care about and then you've got to spin it.

589
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:46,768
Speaker 0: You put your thumb on it and you spin it.

590
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:50,279
Speaker 0: Whoa, and you know what, you know how fucking non-intuitive this is.

591
00:39:50,943 --> 00:39:53,059
Speaker 0: I didn't know how to interact with them until I looked it up.

592
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:58,040
Speaker 0: Mmm, I know at no point did I think I should spin that thing.

593
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:06,773
Speaker 0: So you go to the pokestop and you spin it a bunch and then a bunch of bubbles appear like four or five bubbles With like individual pokeballs in them and you click on them all to get them.

594
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:11,863
Speaker 0: Okay, which is just real real Real like.

595
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:15,280
Speaker 1: see you basically sit there tapping to collect pokeballs.

596
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know you got to physically walk to the thing and tap it.

597
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,699
Speaker 0: Okay, and then you can go to a gym and if you have a really high level Pokemon you can attack the gym.

598
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:30,240
Speaker 0: and Then you play this really bullshitty game where you jump your Pokemon left and right and like real-time battle the guy.

599
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:39,553
Speaker 0: but level is the only thing that actually matters and level is the CP value and CP value basically just means you spent the most time playing game.

600
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:41,580
Speaker 0: you level up like you want to level up your riddle.

601
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,159
Speaker 0: You got to catch like a million wheedles.

602
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:48,999
Speaker 0: Grind them all into wheedle candy feed wheedle candy to your wheedle to level them up.

603
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:54,440
Speaker 0: So there's basically no way to level up your starter because you can't find Bulbasaurs out there to get Bulbasaur candy.

604
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,829
Speaker 0: So your starter is just completely useless bullshit.

605
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,874
Speaker 1: You can't feed a wheedle candy.

606
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:58,215
Speaker 0: Nope.

607
00:40:58,235 --> 00:41:02,100
Speaker 0: You gotta feed them Bulbasaur candy Because I know you all caught a Bulbasaur in your bathroom.

608
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:08,060
Speaker 1: No, basically, really you only have one of each Pokemon, but their level is equal to pretty much the number of that Pokemon that you've caught.

609
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,311
Speaker 0: Yep, so you catch like a million wheedles.

610
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:12,120
Speaker 0: then when you're bored what about evolution, right?

611
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,320
Speaker 1: So if I catch a wheedle and it becomes a you know, be drill eventually, right?

612
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,930
Speaker 1: Then I catch wheedles and I can't find any be drills in the wild.

613
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:23,062
Speaker 1: Oh every can I feed the wheedle candy to the be Drill.

614
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:23,607
Speaker 0: Yes.

615
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:24,454
Speaker 0: All right, that's fine.

616
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:24,837
Speaker 0: Yep.

617
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,240
Speaker 0: That's fine.

618
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,525
Speaker 0: You can also catch evolved Pokemon all the original all the original 150 or whatever in the game right now You and you two and Dragonite.

619
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:34,772
Speaker 0: and supposedly you can't get like those.

620
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:36,176
Speaker 0: you yet zapdos.

621
00:41:36,377 --> 00:41:38,485
Speaker 0: I think it zapdos already Legendary stuff.

622
00:41:38,606 --> 00:41:39,430
Speaker 0: There's I think you can't.

623
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:39,932
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

624
00:41:40,053 --> 00:41:41,540
Speaker 0: like I said, I haven't really played that much.

625
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,465
Speaker 0: I got like you gone.

626
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:44,495
Speaker 0: I got like 40 Pokemon, but I got omenite.

627
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:49,160
Speaker 0: omenite I just caught the omenite like a kinetic on just like I'd say these teams raise helix.

628
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,088
Speaker 0: But Some Pokemon are region exclusive.

629
00:41:54,128 --> 00:41:59,373
Speaker 0: I think Tara or whatever like one of the one of those Pokemon is like Australia only or Genghis Khan.

630
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,923
Speaker 0: Genghis Khan is The kangaroo.

631
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:02,345
Speaker 1: Yep.

632
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:03,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and mr.

633
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:07,802
Speaker 0: Mime is the Europe exclusive the mime Only.

634
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:10,589
Speaker 0: yeah, the best way I saw it was like Europe.

635
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,434
Speaker 0: We're so sorry.

636
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:13,156
Speaker 1: I'm not sorry.

637
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:13,657
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

638
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:17,972
Speaker 0: Yeah And already all our friends were like rim.

639
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:19,500
Speaker 0: You've got to fucking get us Pokemon.

640
00:42:20,522 --> 00:42:21,486
Speaker 0: I'll be in Australia soon.

641
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:23,033
Speaker 1: So you can get Pokemon for people.

642
00:42:23,113 --> 00:42:23,756
Speaker 1: There's no trading.

643
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:24,560
Speaker 0: there will be trading.

644
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,009
Speaker 0: They've officially said trading will come whatever.

645
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:34,280
Speaker 0: but yeah, the gym is basically just be Ridiculous high-level because you wasted your life and then you can play this bullshitty game.

646
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:41,378
Speaker 0: That really only level matters to take control of the gym and then your Pokemon stays in the gym Fighting off other people until someone else beats it.

647
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:44,755
Speaker 1: So when your Pokemon is in the gym, can you use it say at another gym?

648
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:46,425
Speaker 1: It's just stuck there It's just stuck there.

649
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:47,432
Speaker 1: What happens if it gets beat?

650
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:51,920
Speaker 0: it comes back to you I think I guess dead and then you gotta like revive it and then you can use it again.

651
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:54,040
Speaker 1: Is it at the level it was or does it lose all its levels?

652
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,722
Speaker 0: I think it stays at the level it was at but the gyms Suck.

653
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:02,680
Speaker 0: like I I decided like this game I will play it because it is actually really fun.

654
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,078
Speaker 0: The third piece of the game is the air part where you're walking down the street and it buzzes.

655
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:19,820
Speaker 0: You're like, oh shit There's Pokemon and you pull your phone out and you look at your camera and then you find it and it's in a physical place Like a specific physical place and you see it on your screen overlaid over the real world and it like pegs.

656
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,326
Speaker 1: Then you take a funny screenshot and tweet it.

657
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:24,720
Speaker 0: Yep, because it yeah, you know how many Pokemon I have on people's dicks.

658
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:27,720
Speaker 1: I'm enjoying the tweets without having to play the game.

659
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:30,472
Speaker 1: I'm getting the full benefit without having to waste my life.

660
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:43,060
Speaker 0: that part of the game is Super fun because like I was walking down the street the other day and my phone buzzes and I look I see a Pidgeotto and I'm like, ooh And I tried to catch it, but it kept flying away from me.

661
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,279
Speaker 0: So I like fucking come back here and I'm like chasing this Pidgeotto.

662
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,607
Speaker 0: I threw like 20 pokeballs at it before I got it.

663
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:50,456
Speaker 0: Hmm, but that's the only part of the game.

664
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:50,897
Speaker 0: That's fun.

665
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:58,720
Speaker 0: So I am literally not going to try to level up Never gonna interact with the gyms because they're stupid and also the gym near my office.

666
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,805
Speaker 1: He's gonna try to get funny screenshots.

667
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:08,719
Speaker 0: If you live somewhere still like somewhere like Hicksville Like the local gym has like a CP 30 like you can just go put your Magikarp in there and you're good to go.

668
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:14,799
Speaker 0: but in Manhattan The gym next to me changes hands like a hundred times a day.

669
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:22,020
Speaker 0: Lie and add that the people who are attacking it are so high level that I don't even know how that happens.

670
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:23,832
Speaker 1: They're not doing anything else with their lives.

671
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:24,859
Speaker 1: They're not podcasting.

672
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just play Pokemon.

673
00:44:26,227 --> 00:44:28,600
Speaker 1: go play it and while they're work play it on the subway play it on the way home.

674
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,546
Speaker 1: Play play play play play.

675
00:44:29,707 --> 00:44:30,512
Speaker 0: So I guess don't get me wrong.

676
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:34,910
Speaker 0: The game is fun, but it is Like the minimum effort.

677
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,316
Speaker 1: it is the mindless candy box.

678
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:38,648
Speaker 0: We thought it would be yep And the AR part is fun.

679
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:40,319
Speaker 0: None of the other parts of it are fun.

680
00:44:41,163 --> 00:44:48,636
Speaker 0: If you think you're gonna play it at all It's probably worth it to play it now and put in the minimum effort Because this kind of game the other thing that's likely to happen strike

681
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:49,280
Speaker 1: while the irons hot

682
00:44:49,763 --> 00:45:04,339
Speaker 0: When they add more stuff to make the game better You don't want to decide to start the game then because then you're that dude who's playing World of Warcraft Doing the beginning like terrible contents while everyone else is playing the new awesome thing that came out.

683
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:12,960
Speaker 1: You're that dude who tries to start playing netrunner and everyone else's already has all these cards or playing You know Magic the Gathering and everyone else already has all these cards.

684
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:22,180
Speaker 0: So and also usually these kinds of games There'll be ways to level up now to power level that will probably disappear in the future.

685
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,380
Speaker 1: You show up at the Warhammer meetup and you got your brand new little tiny piece of Space Marine.

686
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:33,080
Speaker 1: But everyone else and a man everyone longer than you are Already has a giant painted army and you got your little squad.

687
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:35,280
Speaker 0: But the AR part is super fun.

688
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:40,842
Speaker 0: So I do recommend it to play that part because the thing I say I'm saying that's amazing is Like.

689
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:43,880
Speaker 0: so when we came home from Connecticut was like right after the game went live.

690
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:50,400
Speaker 0: I got to the subway station in Long Island City pretty late at night like 11 o'clock and I come out of the subway station.

691
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,640
Speaker 0: You know Queens Plaza like way over in the middle of nowhere and I'm walking back through that park.

692
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,467
Speaker 0: There's a little park under the subway tracks.

693
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,655
Speaker 0: That's empty like hobos live there.

694
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,558
Speaker 0: Like there's never anyone there.

695
00:45:59,578 --> 00:46:01,565
Speaker 0: at night It was crowded.

696
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:06,160
Speaker 0: there were like 40 people milling around and every one of them had Pokemon out.

697
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,731
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people playing this game.

698
00:46:08,174 --> 00:46:08,960
Speaker 1: like no question.

699
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:09,443
Speaker 1: I see.

700
00:46:09,644 --> 00:46:12,320
Speaker 1: I see this game being played on the street pretty much everywhere.

701
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:15,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there's a giant crowd of people the funniest thing in the world.

702
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:19,960
Speaker 0: There's a big crowd of people in City Hall Park and every day they're there like huge amounts of people.

703
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,979
Speaker 0: They're all playing the game.

704
00:46:21,622 --> 00:46:35,607
Speaker 0: There's this one dude and he's there like multiple times a week when I'm out at lunch and he's like He's basically trying to be an evangelist for ingress to the Pokemon kids like oh kid I see you're playing Pokemon.

705
00:46:35,808 --> 00:46:37,896
Speaker 0: You want to play the real game the Pokemon is based on.

706
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:39,999
Speaker 0: the kids are like, dude No that game sucks.

707
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,887
Speaker 1: But why doesn't he just start playing Pokemon?

708
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:43,810
Speaker 0: because he's real mad.

709
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,498
Speaker 0: all the ingress people seem real mad that everyone's playing Pokemon.

710
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,583
Speaker 1: because What is?

711
00:46:47,623 --> 00:46:48,548
Speaker 1: it is shut ingress down?

712
00:46:48,568 --> 00:46:49,071
Speaker 1: What's the point?

713
00:46:49,232 --> 00:46:50,740
Speaker 0: because the people who played are obsessed with it?

714
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,988
Speaker 1: There's not that many people playing it.

715
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,460
Speaker 0: There's a decent number of people playing it.

716
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,947
Speaker 1: Money on it just cost money to run.

717
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:56,629
Speaker 1: just shut it down.

718
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,776
Speaker 0: Remember Pokemon also has microtransactions.

719
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,140
Speaker 0: It's monetized.

720
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,324
Speaker 1: Well, what can you buy?

721
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:05,660
Speaker 0: you can buy in-game money that can be used to buy like pokeballs and upgrades and shit.

722
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:08,136
Speaker 1: So basically spend money and you don't have to spin the hoop.

723
00:47:08,438 --> 00:47:12,286
Speaker 1: Yep So they see instead of spinning the hoop at the focus top You can just pay money and get pokeballs.

724
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:16,746
Speaker 0: So all the people who said when Nintendo finally does mobile They'll do mobile right and mobile different.

725
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:17,969
Speaker 0: No, they're doing mobile the same.

726
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:20,517
Speaker 0: It's same mobile just with a Pokemon skin.

727
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,099
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

728
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:27,654
Speaker 0: But that's the thing that's interesting there with the ingress stuff is that ingress existed.

729
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,720
Speaker 0: it was the beta test for Pokemon.

730
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:33,852
Speaker 0: Pokemon comes out and now you have something that's never happened before.

731
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:38,478
Speaker 0: there's two augmented reality games Which are overlays on the real world, right?

732
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,684
Speaker 0: They use the same data.

733
00:47:41,265 --> 00:47:44,132
Speaker 0: So every pokestop is an ingress portal.

734
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:51,380
Speaker 0: Okay, meaning the two games clash with each other in the real world.

735
00:47:52,461 --> 00:48:04,560
Speaker 0: It'd be like if you made a an MMO and then someone else made a different MMO But somehow like characters from the two MMOs could see each other because they're set in the same world of like a while or whatever.

736
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:05,621
Speaker 0: Like.

737
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:10,033
Speaker 0: that's the kind of thing that no one who designed video games ever had to worry about before.

738
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:25,048
Speaker 0: but because the substrate for AR Games is reality if you decide to put a thing in your AR game in the real world It effectively conflicts with any other AR game that has the thing in that same place also conflicts with real life.

739
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:29,879
Speaker 0: Yes, and No one's answered all those questions yet.

740
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:45,500
Speaker 0: So just like when mobas started appearing or MMOs started appearing or video games started appearing Although there's a whole bunch of new questions No one's ever had to ask before and suddenly a whole bunch of people on Twitter are giving really bad answers to those questions.

741
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:52,078
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
