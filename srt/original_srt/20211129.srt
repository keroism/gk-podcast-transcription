1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,179
Speaker 0: It's Monday, November 29th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:10,500
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:14,109
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,996
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:19,570
Speaker 0: It is our 2021 Technology Gift Giving Guide.

6
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,348
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:26,690
Speaker 0: So for lunch today, I went up and I got my booster shot.

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,870
Speaker 0: It was the first appointment I could get at the CVS on Steinway, like a little bit north of here.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,337
Speaker 1: I made an appointment.

10
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,970
Speaker 1: I went into my doctor's app, right?

11
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:37,049
Speaker 1: And I went to it like a couple of weeks ago.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,528
Speaker 1: And when you go in, it was like, "Hey, do you meet these requirements to be

13
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:41,970
Speaker 1: eligible?".

14
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,987
Speaker 1: And I was just like, "Well, I know I'm allowed to say yes, even if I'm not, but...".

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,490
Speaker 1: So then they changed it like a few days before Thanksgiving.

16
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:54,190
Speaker 1: They just removed that question.

17
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,344
Speaker 1: So I went in and it's like, "You want an appointment?

18
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:56,606
Speaker 1: Okay,

19
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:56,828
Speaker 1: when?".

20
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:02,246
Speaker 1: So I made an appointment and I chose literally like the first day.

21
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:03,250
Speaker 1: appointments were available.

22
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,117
Speaker 1: And it said Friday.

23
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:05,710
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Oh, I guess they..." Right?

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,078
Speaker 1: And then I go there, a Black Friday.

25
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,263
Speaker 1: And it's kind of creepy.

26
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:14,949
Speaker 1: There's no one there.

27
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:16,389
Speaker 1: And it's like locked.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,491
Speaker 1: And eventually, my appointment is 1210.

29
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:23,230
Speaker 1: At noon, someone does indeed come and try to open the door.

30
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,030
Speaker 1: And they're clearly a worker there.

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,807
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Hey, yeah, I'm

32
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:27,029
Speaker 1: here.".

33
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:27,898
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Oh, we're

34
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,383
Speaker 1: closed.".

35
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:33,044
Speaker 1: And I look at the app again and it's like, "Yeah, Friday, December 19th, not

36
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:33,545
Speaker 1: November.".

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,430
Speaker 0: One of my biggest fears in life is that I will someday show up at like an airport just on the wrong day.

38
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,149
Speaker 1: Or December 17th, I don't know.

39
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,389
Speaker 0: That is something that I am like hyper... I've never done it, but I am hyper paranoid about doing it.

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,935
Speaker 1: I mean, no big deal.

41
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,210
Speaker 1: I just walked home and I'll just go back there in a couple weeks.

42
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:58,130
Speaker 0: This is when I did the CVS thing because my doctor didn't have any availability anytime soon.

43
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,010
Speaker 0: So it was easier just to do the CVS website.

44
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,909
Speaker 1: I thought mine did, but apparently they didn't.

45
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,350
Speaker 0: But the CVS website was annoying because it'll list all the CVS's like in an area that have reservations.

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,990
Speaker 0: But you have to... or have the vaccine, but you have to click on each one to see if there's time slots.

47
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,540
Speaker 0: And they'll all say, "No time

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,861
Speaker 0: slots.".

49
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:17,190
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't bubble that up.

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,536
Speaker 1: One of those shitty systems.

51
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:21,349
Speaker 1: Why is that a problem in just so many scheduling systems?

52
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:26,830
Speaker 0: I think it's a combination of either they don't have UX designers or the UX designers don't care.

53
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:28,481
Speaker 0: Or they ignore the UX designers.

54
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:29,549
Speaker 0: I've seen many times.

55
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,909
Speaker 0: Sometimes they just try to rush this stuff out and don't worry that much.

56
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,615
Speaker 1: It's not usually a UX problem.

57
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:39,910
Speaker 1: The problem is, like we had that problem when I worked in ticketing, right?

58
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,022
Speaker 1: Is that we don't control the source of the data.

59
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:50,110
Speaker 1: So I can't just query the database directly and say select where appointment is available.

60
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,520
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, you want to get to that level?

61
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:52,529
Speaker 0: One pattern I've seen.

62
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:00,810
Speaker 1: So it's like you're interacting with this other system and you could scrape it and then query your scrape.

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,516
Speaker 1: But then that could be out of date.

64
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:09,489
Speaker 1: The only API call they give you is, "Tell us a date and a place and we'll give you the list of

65
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:09,810
Speaker 1: times.".

66
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,030
Speaker 0: Ah, but I wasn't using an aggregator.

67
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,389
Speaker 1: They need to make another API endpoint available that says, you know, or marks things as, you know, "Duh, sold

68
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,690
Speaker 1: out."

69
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,388
Speaker 1: Or, you know, "No appointments

70
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:19,590
Speaker 1: available.".

71
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:22,681
Speaker 0: But in this case, I didn't use an aggregator.

72
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:25,350
Speaker 0: This was within the entirety of the CVS ecosystem.

73
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:36,870
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm saying the CVS people, right, their system that gets like what appointments are available might not be some centralized database of correctness.

74
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,070
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I believe that 100%.

75
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:46,250
Speaker 1: It might be like each individual CVS has its own thing and they had to query each one when you choose it.

76
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:49,724
Speaker 0: I would bet they can't query them all at a high rate.

77
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:51,210
Speaker 0: or they go down or have a problem.

78
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,350
Speaker 0: So they only query on demand when a user clicks.

79
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,190
Speaker 1: Or they just have a poorly designed system instead of a centralized database of truth.

80
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,410
Speaker 0: I mean, I live in a world where there's no such thing as like my day job, a centralized repository of truth.

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:12,450
Speaker 0: In fact, I've been responsible for making repositories of truth out of the ether to be the authoritative records for things.

82
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:19,010
Speaker 0: But I have a small number of authoritative databases I can trust.

83
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:35,889
Speaker 0: And I have a huge number of, not untrusted in the internet sense, but untrusted in the "I don't control the SLA or the structure of those things, yet I need to rely on data from those things that I cannot or should not replicate locally without keeping it synchronized in some

84
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:36,250
Speaker 0: fashion.".

85
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,810
Speaker 0: So it's a common problem in enterprise.

86
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,414
Speaker 0: And you know what?

87
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:41,010
Speaker 0: There's no good solutions to it.

88
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:42,950
Speaker 0: Usually there's some really stupid-.

89
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is.

90
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:49,650
Speaker 1: It's that if you have to interact with one of those such things, you should just take ownership of it and absorb it into your perfect centralized database.

91
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,291
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

92
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,710
Speaker 0: I mean, there is a good way to deal with it.

93
00:04:52,850 --> 00:05:03,950
Speaker 0: And then there is a good way to deal with it that can make it through the enterprise world of politics, interlocking dependencies, unwillingness of a company to invest in that kind of system, et cetera.

94
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:17,370
Speaker 1: Or at least if the other person wants to keep owning it, then they have to keep it up, keep it reliable, provide the queries so that I don't have to do one at a time to check each individual CVS location.

95
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:29,910
Speaker 0: Something I've encountered occasionally just out there, not even just at my company, but in capital markets overall, has been the problem where there's an old system people want data out of, but no one really owns that system anymore.

96
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,418
Speaker 0: It's not being maintained, but it's being used.

97
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:40,916
Speaker 0: And the most common problem I see there, the pattern is specifically no one officially owns it, and it's been mostly working fine.

98
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:44,850
Speaker 0: Nobody wants to own it because if there's ever a problem, they got to deal with it.

99
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:53,870
Speaker 0: Whoever asks for anything from it or touches it in any way becomes its de facto owner, including all that baggage, so nobody ever touches it.

100
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,670
Speaker 1: But I mean, it's up, so someone touched it last.

101
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:05,230
Speaker 0: I can say professionally in the past at other companies, I have encountered systems that are owned by nobody.

102
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,550
Speaker 0: They just happen to have not had a problem in like a decade.

103
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,510
Speaker 0: In fact, at IBM, I encountered such a system.

104
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:15,621
Speaker 1: At my company, they recently instituted service ownership.

105
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:17,789
Speaker 1: We made a spreadsheet that shows who owns each thing.

106
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,642
Speaker 1: So now we know everything we have, and we know who owns each thing.

107
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,290
Speaker 1: I ended up owning too many things, more than I thought I could.

108
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:34,890
Speaker 0: Oh, I had a conversation with a group at one point where they discovered that I am directly responsible for more engineering teams than is allowed.

109
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:43,390
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's fun that you're adjacent to the enterprise world that I've dealt with for basically my entire career now.

110
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,093
Speaker 0: But I got the vaccine.

111
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:45,695
Speaker 0: It was great.

112
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:46,377
Speaker 0: I got the Pfizer.

113
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:49,285
Speaker 0: I got the flu shot at the same time because I was due for that.

114
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:49,786
Speaker 0: Why not?

115
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,070
Speaker 0: You should get the flu shot.

116
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,094
Speaker 1: I always get the flu shot.

117
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:56,590
Speaker 1: I have a Google calendar reminder every single year, October 1st, to go get the flu shot.

118
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,515
Speaker 0: So I got my flu shot, but the appointment system actually did work.

119
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:11,730
Speaker 0: And the way it worked was when I showed up at the CVS, they texted me, and I had to go into the app and click the button when I was physically in the store, saying that I am physically here.

120
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,357
Speaker 0: I am ready to receive this shot at any time.

121
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,724
Speaker 0: It was like an airline check-in process almost.

122
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:17,907
Speaker 0: Then it worked.

123
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:18,710
Speaker 0: It was perfectly nice.

124
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:22,238
Speaker 0: But biking to the place to get the vaccine.

125
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:23,080
Speaker 0: I start biking.

126
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,002
Speaker 0: It's really nice out.

127
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,570
Speaker 0: And it suddenly starts snowing like crazy on me.

128
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,073
Speaker 1: It's really nice.

129
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:28,998
Speaker 1: It starts snowing.

130
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:29,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

131
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:30,806
Speaker 1: It was cold today.

132
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,590
Speaker 1: It was not nice.

133
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,161
Speaker 0: It was like 40-something.

134
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:34,430
Speaker 0: That's perfectly bikable weather.

135
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,229
Speaker 0: It's cold.

136
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,196
Speaker 0: I was wearing a t-shirt under my jacket in this ride.

137
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:45,030
Speaker 0: The only problem was the snow started going up in the wind and getting in my face while I was riding.

138
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's gonna happen.

139
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I had it not snowed.

140
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:50,360
Speaker 0: When I'm skiing, you know what I wear?

141
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,030
Speaker 0: Big honking goggles.

142
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,669
Speaker 1: So if you don't wear those, you don't like it?

143
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,951
Speaker 0: Uh, depending.

144
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,838
Speaker 0: I mean, spring skiing, it's usually not snowing.

145
00:07:58,898 --> 00:08:04,750
Speaker 0: I'll ski in shorts, maybe a long-sleeve shirt, and just my regular glasses, no helmet or anything.

146
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,318
Speaker 0: But that's different kinds of skiing.

147
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,069
Speaker 0: It's usually 50 degrees at that point.

148
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:27,250
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's some interesting news about the boosters, and there is significant and growing evidence that if you get your booster vaccine shot for COVID, not only does it restore the known waning efficacy of the current vaccines, but- For how long?

149
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:31,346
Speaker 1: So there's at least significant evidence- You gotta do this every six months, every year?

150
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:31,710
Speaker 1: How long?

151
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:34,157
Speaker 0: That's what everyone's trying to figure out right now.

152
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,065
Speaker 0: That is unsettled science.

153
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,750
Speaker 0: We're all gonna learn about this together.

154
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,770
Speaker 1: How come I can get a tetanus shot that lasts a zillion years, but this shot doesn't last very long?

155
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,969
Speaker 0: Partly because tetanus is, one, you're not that likely to encounter tetanus.

156
00:08:49,990 --> 00:09:13,730
Speaker 0: Sure, but- It depends on what it is in your- what your body remembers about that pathogen, and what the body's response is to that pathogen.

157
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:21,228
Speaker 0: And for whatever reason, this kind of thing, our immune system just says, "I haven't seen that in a while, probably not a problem

158
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:21,609
Speaker 0: anymore.".

159
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,091
Speaker 1: You haven't seen tetanus in a while, it's like 2012.

160
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:31,850
Speaker 0: Every ten years, plus a bunch of times, because I kept forgetting when I got my last tetanus shot, my body was reminded about tetanus.

161
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,395
Speaker 1: I got it in Australia, that's all I can remember.

162
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:36,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically ten years, almost ten years, nine years tetanus shot.

163
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,370
Speaker 1: I'm probably still just fine.

164
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,080
Speaker 0: What was the thing the nurse said to me once?

165
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:43,806
Speaker 1: If you can't remember- This fancy mRNA COVID vaccine couldn't even last a year?

166
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:44,430
Speaker 1: Is that- come on.

167
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,078
Speaker 0: If you ever have to answer the question, "When was your last tetanus

168
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:47,318
Speaker 0: shot?"

169
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,147
Speaker 0: and you don't immediately know the answer, the answer is, "Right the fuck

170
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:50,408
Speaker 0: now.".

171
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,068
Speaker 0: Here it comes.

172
00:09:53,271 --> 00:10:08,570
Speaker 0: But the evidence shows that one thing we do know, when you get the third shot, that booster shot, assuming you're not immunocompromised or have something else going on, your antibody level and your apparent immunity is higher than it was at any point, including after your second shot.

173
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,330
Speaker 0: Like it boosts above and gives you increased efficacy.

174
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,930
Speaker 1: Alright, we'll see how long it takes before that runs out.

175
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,830
Speaker 0: Yep, but go get your booster shots.

176
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,382
Speaker 0: Because the other big news that we are not going to talk about further, because we

177
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:22,863
Speaker 1: know as

178
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:32,911
Speaker 0: much as you do, because nobody knows anything yet, but the World Health Organization has classified the recent Omicron variant of COVID- I noticed

179
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:38,590
Speaker 1: how there were a lot- there's a lot of- I just want to say, like, I don't know too much about the Greek alphabet, right?

180
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:39,362
Speaker 1: Yeah.

181
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,870
Speaker 1: There's a lot of letters between Delta and Omicron.

182
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's been a bunch of other variants that ended up not being that big a deal.

183
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,369
Speaker 1: How come no one's made a ruckus about those?

184
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:54,110
Speaker 0: They did, but- so one of them, I forget which one's which, but like one of them never really made it out of Brazil, so it didn't matter that much.

185
00:10:55,191 --> 00:11:01,930
Speaker 0: Two of them, while they might have been a concern, Delta completely displaced them to the point that nobody even bothered, like, worrying about them anymore.

186
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:06,730
Speaker 0: There have been a bunch of variants that just didn't end up being that big a deal in the end, for a bunch of reasons.

187
00:11:10,022 --> 00:11:14,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the problem with the Omicron variant is that it is spread rapidly.

188
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,220
Speaker 0: People are taking notice, like my work just canceled, like all our travel.

189
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,700
Speaker 0: A bunch of countries closed their borders, like recently.

190
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,180
Speaker 0: I think late yesterday, Japan closes borders to all foreigners indefinitely.

191
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:40,420
Speaker 0: So, regardless of how bad this variant actually is, all we know about it is that it appears to spread much more readily than any known variant up to this point, and has a lot of mutations in the areas that are concerning.

192
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,018
Speaker 0: But that's all we know for now.

193
00:11:43,961 --> 00:12:00,580
Speaker 0: I advise you, as a layperson who doesn't know anything about this stuff beyond what I just said, and even what I just said, I got from reading like three news websites, a Wikipedia, a Discord, and DMing with someone, but get the booster shot if you're not vaccinated for the love of fucking God, get the vaccination.

194
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,020
Speaker 0: And exercise caution, wear masks, avoid crowds, like, do what's been working.

195
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,980
Speaker 1: I'm going to advise you to, it's winter, at least in the northern hemisphere.

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,599
Speaker 1: Play a lot of video games.

197
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:17,580
Speaker 1: There's no reason to go outside except to get a shot, so other than getting shots, stay inside.

198
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:18,964
Speaker 1: Why would you go out there?

199
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,240
Speaker 1: Even if there wasn't this new variant, why would you go out until next year?

200
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,615
Speaker 0: Even now, I've only been inside of maybe 12 buildings since COVID began.

201
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:30,480
Speaker 0: I just don't go anywhere.

202
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,032
Speaker 1: I only got two days of work left after today.

203
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:34,454
Speaker 1: I'm done.

204
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:35,418
Speaker 1: I'm just staying inside.

205
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:35,719
Speaker 1: That's it.

206
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,593
Speaker 1: Not that I had to go anywhere to work.

207
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:40,360
Speaker 1: I'm 40.

208
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am still required to go into the office three days a week.

209
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,360
Speaker 1: I ain't going nowhere.

210
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:57,999
Speaker 0: So just stay cautious, stay on top of this, and if you have travel plans, keep an extra close eye on this because it's already causing significant shutdowns of borders, canceling of flights, etc.

211
00:12:59,022 --> 00:12:59,460
Speaker 1: Whatever.

212
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:09,005
Speaker 0: In some other news, another thing I wanted to talk about, this happened a while ago, but it looks like it resolved itself before we got to talk about it.

213
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:14,400
Speaker 0: You might know, there's a thing called OBS, Open Broadcasters System, right?

214
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,306
Speaker 0: That's what it stands for?

215
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,000
Speaker 0: It's open source software.

216
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,720
Speaker 1: It's the software you use to do streaming, basically.

217
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,252
Speaker 0: Yep, it is what I'm using right now to stream Geek Nights.

218
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,478
Speaker 0: It's widely used.

219
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Speaker 0: It's extremely good.

220
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,439
Speaker 0: It's open broadcaster software.

221
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:27,898
Speaker 0: Yes.

222
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:36,319
Speaker 1: Basically, there's plenty of software out there you can use to do live video, audio, streaming, routing, etc.

223
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,379
Speaker 1: But OBS is the free one that does everything and that's the standard that everyone integrates with.

224
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,780
Speaker 0: And it's free open source.

225
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:51,920
Speaker 0: And it just so happens to be that it is also really good and in a lot of ways better than even a lot of commercial for money solutions depending on exactly what you're doing.

226
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,100
Speaker 1: In some ways it's very, very, very good and in some ways it's very not so good.

227
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:55,622
Speaker 0: Yep.

228
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,260
Speaker 0: If you know a lot about streaming, it is just a plus, plus, plus.

229
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,941
Speaker 1: Right.

230
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:05,760
Speaker 1: It's good enough that you can get it done and all the alternatives that are like better cost a fortune.

231
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,500
Speaker 1: So it's like for the price to goodness ratio is off the charts.

232
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,080
Speaker 0: And I've tried some of those for money offerings and some of them, yeah, they're like OBS plus some stuff.

233
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,286
Speaker 0: Like they're just easier.

234
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:18,909
Speaker 0: They work better.

235
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:20,680
Speaker 0: Some of them are just worse.

236
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:22,759
Speaker 1: Or some of them are just worse.

237
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:28,900
Speaker 1: I think the only reason to use something besides OBS is if you are actually like a real TV station or some shit.

238
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:38,540
Speaker 0: So in a discord I'm in with a bunch of people in that industry and in the casting industry like sportscasters, game casters, like all that stuff.

239
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,180
Speaker 0: Most of them seem to be using OBS or they're using OBS and a hardware solution that is streaming to OBS.

240
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,820
Speaker 1: Could be, you know, OBS could be mixed in with like professional solutions.

241
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,920
Speaker 1: But yeah, I don't think that like if you go to a professional sporting event that OBS is in the truck.

242
00:14:56,381 --> 00:15:00,280
Speaker 1: But at a minor league sporting event, it very well could be.

243
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:00,941
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

244
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:05,311
Speaker 0: So Streamlabs, different organization.

245
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:08,780
Speaker 0: They used OBS code because OBS is open source.

246
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,668
Speaker 0: You can totally do that.

247
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,599
Speaker 0: That's like how.

248
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,349
Speaker 1: Streamlabs basically makes a bunch of products that help.

249
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:22,835
Speaker 1: if you are a streamer, you can use their products like help your stream, integrate with your stream, add features, you know, I forget.

250
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,200
Speaker 1: They offer a lot of different stuff.

251
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,113
Speaker 1: But one, you know, it's like those little someone subscribe pop ups.

252
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,140
Speaker 1: They got a thing for that, you know, all that kind of junk.

253
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:31,642
Speaker 0: Yep.

254
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:36,537
Speaker 0: So Streamlabs used OBS code to launch their Streamlabs thing like fine.

255
00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:37,220
Speaker 0: That's totally cool.

256
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:44,520
Speaker 1: They made a fork of OBS called Streamlabs OBS and it's basically it's OBS because they just took it's a fork.

257
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,843
Speaker 1: It's the same exact source code.

258
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:52,040
Speaker 1: Plus they added stuff into it, you know, to integrate their products and also add some other features and whatnot.

259
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:57,377
Speaker 1: And in some ways you could say it was better, you know, added features OBS didn't have.

260
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:58,199
Speaker 1: It was still free.

261
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:05,640
Speaker 1: So some people used regular OBS and some people use the Streamlabs OBS fork just because they liked it better.

262
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:08,076
Speaker 1: Or maybe they were using Streamlabs services.

263
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:08,619
Speaker 1: Maybe not.

264
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

265
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:15,095
Speaker 0: And one extremely gigantic streamer, Pokimane, used it like pointedly.

266
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,020
Speaker 0: So that's part of how it got very popular.

267
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:23,172
Speaker 1: I'm sure there were times where Streamlabs was paying streamers to maybe use that instead.

268
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:26,400
Speaker 1: or maybe streamers just liked it better for some reason.

269
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:36,360
Speaker 1: And also, I think their main business idea was, hey, if we can make a better OBS to convince people to use that, that'll provide a gateway for them to use our services that are integrated.

270
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,980
Speaker 1: Even though we're just making this fork of OBS and giving it out for free.

271
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,740
Speaker 0: So they called this thing SLoBs or Streamlabs OBS or SL OBS.

272
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,100
Speaker 1: Which is, I guess, semantically accurate in that it is OBS, like 90% of it, but it's their fork of it, the Streamlabs OBS.

273
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,600
Speaker 0: So I'm going to quote a statement because apparently there's a bunch of drama happening behind the scenes.

274
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:08,020
Speaker 0: And on November 16th, OBS, like the people who maintain OBS, were sick of it and they made a public statement.

275
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,407
Speaker 0: "Near the launch of SL OBS, Streamlabs reached out to us about using the OBS name.

276
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,452
Speaker 0: We kindly asked them not to.

277
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,858
Speaker 0: They did so anyway and followed up by filing a

278
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:19,499
Speaker 0: trademark.".

279
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,863
Speaker 0: This went back and forth.

280
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:33,140
Speaker 0: OBS, they started talking about how tons of people would open tickets, complain to them about problems in Streamlabs because normal people have no idea.

281
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:42,318
Speaker 1: Most users from OBS's perspective, the open source people, is that, "Hey, you were allowed to make a fork of our open source software.

282
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,400
Speaker 1: That's perfectly okay.

283
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:49,838
Speaker 1: But because you use the same name, we're getting complaints when it's actually your software that's broken and not

284
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:50,118
Speaker 1: ours.".

285
00:17:51,061 --> 00:18:01,180
Speaker 1: And also it's like, "Yeah, I guess your name is semantically accurate in that it's like the Streamlabs OBS, but we have a trademark for OBS.

286
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,654
Speaker 1: We were here first and you can't do

287
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:03,835
Speaker 1: that.".

288
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:04,739
Speaker 1: And also we said no.

289
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:13,860
Speaker 0: Similar things happened way back in the day around Nessus and the tools that came before and after it and also Wireshark and the tools that came before and after it.

290
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,940
Speaker 1: There have been lots of instances of open source softwares and not open source softwares having to change names because of trademark reasons.

291
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,427
Speaker 1: A lot of Firefox forks having to use different names like Iceweasel.

292
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:28,215
Speaker 1: There was Gaim that had to change its name to Pigeon.

293
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 1: All kinds of stuff like that.

294
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,361
Speaker 1: Yup.

295
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:33,766
Speaker 0: Still using that Phoenix browser.

296
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:41,100
Speaker 0: But there's also a situation where private companies would take open source software, package it up with a little bit of secret sauce, and then sell it.

297
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:53,600
Speaker 0: And while they would usually strictly comply with the license, they would also obfuscate that the open source software that existed did 99% of what their very expensive variant of that software did.

298
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:01,335
Speaker 1: It is perfectly legal to take, say, some open source program like, say, Audacity.

299
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:02,197
Speaker 1: Is that GPL licensed?

300
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:08,080
Speaker 0: I don't even know because I'm 100% on the Adobe train at this point.

301
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,945
Speaker 1: I guess the GIMP is open.

302
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:14,159
Speaker 1: You could take the GIMP, you could call it the Scott and sell it.

303
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:23,100
Speaker 1: And as long as you're distributing the source code for the Scott somewhere and such, you can sell the Scott on CD-ROM to people.

304
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,619
Speaker 1: And if they don't know about the GIMP, you're literally just selling the GIMP with a different name.

305
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:40,610
Speaker 0: So, Pokemain, that Twitch streamer, basically called out Streamlabs and said, "Yo, fix this or I'm not gonna use your stupid software

306
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:40,850
Speaker 0: anymore.".

307
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:46,192
Speaker 0: And that caused Streamlabs to immediately agree to change their name.

308
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:49,199
Speaker 0: They issued a statement like, "How long was

309
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:49,339
Speaker 0: this?".

310
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,217
Speaker 0: Less than 24 hours after Pokemain was like, "Yo, Streamlabs,

311
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:53,579
Speaker 0: WTF?".

312
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,820
Speaker 0: So, I'll link to the article if you want to see the whole story.

313
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,607
Speaker 1: So, the software, their fork of OBS is still available.

314
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:01,369
Speaker 1: They're still making it.

315
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:05,000
Speaker 1: They're just calling it Streamlabs instead of Streamlabs OBS.

316
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,500
Speaker 0: Yep.

317
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:20,420
Speaker 0: Now, my take is, this is just my opinion, that Streamlabs was definitely trying to capitalize on the popularity of OBS for Google Juice and maybe even capitalize on the confusion among users.

318
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:25,800
Speaker 1: I think it was definitely capitalize on people installing theirs by accident.

319
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,277
Speaker 0: Especially considering they asked and were told no.

320
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,163
Speaker 1: Not knowing that there were two.

321
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:34,154
Speaker 1: Most users don't realize that there's a fork.

322
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:35,980
Speaker 1: They don't understand even that concept, right?

323
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,525
Speaker 1: So, they don't even know that there's one or the other.

324
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:52,238
Speaker 1: And also too, like I said before, if they can get people to use theirs instead of the mainstream one, then that provides an avenue for people to end up using their services that they actually charge money for.

325
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,711
Speaker 1: Whereas if you use regular OBS, the Streamlabs is not automatically integrated.

326
00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:01,440
Speaker 1: You're less likely to end up using Streamlabs services.

327
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,020
Speaker 0: Yep.

328
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,429
Speaker 0: Which is interesting because it gets to sort of an aside that I've noticed.

329
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:20,118
Speaker 0: many of the non-OBS pay or variant software that does streaming, usually their secret sauce is either they do a one-click thing for multi-streaming, they do a one-click thing to really easily stream to Twitch.

330
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:32,300
Speaker 0: specifically, they do things that just make your life easier, or they have heavy integrations with all the weird social chat stuff that gaming streamers are really obsessed with putting in their overlays.

331
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:41,300
Speaker 1: I mean, basically what you're doing, a lot of those kinds of alternatives are basically just making up for the fact that OBS comes unconfigured.

332
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:53,000
Speaker 1: They're doing all this work because the most common use case is I am a streamer who is streaming my face and a screen and doing these specific things.

333
00:21:53,981 --> 00:22:02,960
Speaker 1: So they get that specific setup ready to go out of the gate by default so you don't have to do as much configuring and you're more likely to succeed.

334
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:05,444
Speaker 1: And therefore, it's popular.

335
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:12,918
Speaker 1: if you don't know enough about technology and you try to set up just regular old OBS, it's like, "Well, you're starting with nothing.

336
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:13,238
Speaker 1: Good

337
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:13,479
Speaker 1: luck.".

338
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:20,820
Speaker 0: And that second half of it is mostly around putting all the chat integration stuff on the sides of overlays.

339
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:37,748
Speaker 0: I have an opinion there that I think is better for a gaming episode, but I suspect the current overload on a lot of streams of a million moving widgets everywhere and all this ridiculous, almost over-integration of the UI.

340
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:38,509
Speaker 0: That's cool.

341
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:40,814
Speaker 0: I'm not going to do the old man thing and say, "That sucks.

342
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:41,315
Speaker 0: Stop it.

343
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,419
Speaker 0: I want my stream to just be a webcam and a

344
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:43,779
Speaker 0: screen.".

345
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,443
Speaker 0: No, I made a nice overlay for Geek Nights.

346
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:58,360
Speaker 0: I suspect the current aesthetic and graphic design of overlays that are popular in gaming will be seen within a decade as similar to the GeoCities era of web.

347
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, I agree with that.

348
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:01,930
Speaker 1: Aesthetically, yeah.

349
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,340
Speaker 1: But some of those things have merit and some don't, right?

350
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:10,916
Speaker 1: I remember I was thinking, "Why would you put the chat in your stream when the chat is next to the stream on Twitch?

351
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:11,859
Speaker 1: What's the point of

352
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:12,019
Speaker 1: that?".

353
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,483
Speaker 1: And there's two points to that.

354
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:19,999
Speaker 1: Point number one, if your stream is embedded somewhere, people can see the chat where the chat's not there because they're not on Twitch.tv.

355
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:24,068
Speaker 1: And secondly, you might be multi-streaming.

356
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:25,811
Speaker 1: You might have chats combining together.

357
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:29,620
Speaker 1: And third, if someone goes full screen, now they can still see the chat.

358
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,164
Speaker 1: So it's not without merit doing some of those things.

359
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:43,080
Speaker 1: But yeah, the aesthetic of stream layouts currently is definitely going to end up being a nostalgic GeoCities-type aesthetic ten, twenty years from now.

360
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:58,000
Speaker 0: Like some of it, the ridiculous effects that come in whenever there's a new sub or something, I feel like those are driven primarily by the toxic monetization model where people are desperate to get those subs and they have to reward their viewers on stream to get them to sub in some cases.

361
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a psychological thing.

362
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:03,252
Speaker 1: Like, you know, somebody noticed me because I gave them money.

363
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:04,836
Speaker 1: They said my name.

364
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:05,738
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Get it.

365
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:05,859
Speaker 1: Who

366
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:06,039
Speaker 1: cares?".

367
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,598
Speaker 0: The one time someone sent us a Super Chat, the text of it was something like, "I am paying $5 because Scott will be super pissed off that I did

368
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:13,798
Speaker 0: this.".

369
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:15,060
Speaker 1: Okay.

370
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,398
Speaker 0: That was years ago.

371
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,348
Speaker 1: You're so wealthy, you don't have the $5 to use to earn money.

372
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:21,751
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

373
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:29,286
Speaker 0: But in Seattle, there is a quarter shortage.

374
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:31,288
Speaker 0: Physical quarters.

375
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,650
Speaker 0: It's hard to get quarters.

376
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:39,640
Speaker 0: The problem is arcades, like the few arcades that exist, need quarters to work.

377
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,045
Speaker 0: But more importantly, laundromats.

378
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:47,680
Speaker 0: Every laundry machine in every stupid apartment building, with very few exceptions, still uses quarters.

379
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,059
Speaker 1: They didn't upgrade them to cards like they did in most places?

380
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,363
Speaker 0: Didn't upgrade them to cards.

381
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:58,120
Speaker 0: Well, the card stuff, for one, they cost the people who run them a lot more money than just the old quarter systems.

382
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,966
Speaker 0: Two, they do break down more often.

383
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:07,660
Speaker 0: Three, unbanked and underbanked people, like people without smartphones, people with credit cards, just can't fucking use those things usually.

384
00:25:09,563 --> 00:25:11,880
Speaker 0: And when they have an outage, nobody can do laundry.

385
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,680
Speaker 1: Usually, I find that if you go to a laundromat that has a card system, there'll be an arcade-style machine where you put your card in, you put cash in, and it fills the card up.

386
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,020
Speaker 0: Yep.

387
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:30,180
Speaker 0: But from what I've read, I did a little digging after reading this article, a lot of those systems are way less reliable than the companies would like you to believe.

388
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:38,580
Speaker 1: But a lot of those systems are actually way less secure than they would lead you to believe because they're actually storing the value on the card.

389
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,087
Speaker 1: If you can write to the card somehow, you can just give yourself money.

390
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:49,000
Speaker 1: There's a central database tracking how much your card has because then obviously the laundromat would stop working if the internet was out.

391
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,262
Speaker 0: Yep, so choose your poison.

392
00:25:50,402 --> 00:26:00,100
Speaker 0: Either smart people can just put fake money on the card, like when you hack a Cred Stick with more Nuyen and Shadowrun, or if Amazon East goes down, your laundromat stops working.

393
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:01,502
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much.

394
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:02,523
Speaker 1: Or take quarters.

395
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:04,286
Speaker 1: Or take quarters as a backup.

396
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:05,688
Speaker 1: Do the internet.

397
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:07,270
Speaker 1: I think that's really the ideal.

398
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:14,520
Speaker 1: You do the internet method, and if the internet is down, then you allow quarters to be used.

399
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:20,930
Speaker 0: My interesting takeaway from this is not so much why there's a quarter shortage or the specific problems here.

400
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,992
Speaker 0: You can read the article for that.

401
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:26,480
Speaker 0: Think a lot about, as a technologist, just in general, I know I've harped on this a bunch.

402
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,826
Speaker 0: A few weeks ago I talked about how to use pulleys and practical knowledge.

403
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:40,420
Speaker 0: The quarter system of get quarters and use them to power things like laundromats, or authenticate your right to use a laundromat.

404
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:49,011
Speaker 0: Those kinds of solutions are the kinds of solutions that make people's lives easier, faster, and cheaper than bleeding-edge technology in many cases.

405
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:55,680
Speaker 0: We as a society are very good at focusing on bleeding-edge technology and cutting-edge technology and new technology.

406
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:02,793
Speaker 0: We're very bad at taking the technology we already have that works really well and using it to solve the problems a lot of people already face today.

407
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,700
Speaker 0: And this is just another good example of that.

408
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:16,879
Speaker 1: So the biggest tech news of the day, but there isn't that much to say about it, despite it being huge, is the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorkey, whatever his fucking name is, the crypto bro.

409
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,760
Speaker 0: I have a very low opinion of him, both personally and professionally, if you couldn't tell.

410
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:24,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he quit.

411
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,626
Speaker 1: So that's good, I guess, because crypto bro is out.

412
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:37,960
Speaker 1: I presume he's still the CEO of Square, which is the, they make the point of sale thing and they run Cash App and they're obviously also all in on crypto because the CEO is a crypto bro.

413
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:44,126
Speaker 1: So the good news is he's not CEO of Twitter anymore.

414
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,569
Speaker 1: He's still on the board for however long, you know how it goes.

415
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:51,797
Speaker 1: But the new CEO of Twitter is the former CTO of Twitter.

416
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:53,600
Speaker 1: What's the person's name?

417
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:54,966
Speaker 0: Oh, I just had it up.

418
00:27:55,268 --> 00:27:57,599
Speaker 0: Uh, uh, Perong Agrawal.

419
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,801
Speaker 1: Okay.

420
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:07,876
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, so this person, uh, is probably just going to be more of the same because this wasn't like some outsider, right?

421
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,300
Speaker 1: This is someone who was already working closely with Jack.

422
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:11,423
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

423
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:15,236
Speaker 0: Did the article on Waypo literally spell this guy's name wrong?

424
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:16,120
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

425
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:17,162
Speaker 1: Wow.

426
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:19,032
Speaker 1: Someone who Jack picked, right?

427
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:20,440
Speaker 1: It wasn't, the board didn't pick.

428
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:22,968
Speaker 0: Washington Post, you fucking spelled his name wrong.

429
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,111
Speaker 0: Anyway.

430
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:24,653
Speaker 0: Wow.

431
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,037
Speaker 0: Anyway, that is absolutely.

432
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,184
Speaker 1: But yeah, this, uh, that's, I guess good.

433
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:39,820
Speaker 1: There's going to be some amount of change at Twitter because even if, you know, like even in my, you know, some companies you'll have, uh, you know, executives, right?

434
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,045
Speaker 1: And you think, oh, those, those people are together.

435
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,109
Speaker 1: They're like on the same page, their best buds.

436
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,160
Speaker 1: You know, if you switch, if one of them becomes CEO instead of the other one, what's really going to change?

437
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,203
Speaker 1: And it's like, there's still two different people.

438
00:28:51,243 --> 00:29:00,980
Speaker 1: There'll still be some kind of change, but, uh, I don't know how big the change is going to be given how, uh, you know, Jack like, uh, the new person appears.

439
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,180
Speaker 0: Well, we have one indication from the way people on Twitter reacted to this change because of course a whole bunch of people trust that.

440
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,761
Speaker 0: Oh no.

441
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:16,719
Speaker 0: So a whole bunch of people were just like, oh, now we can get the edit button, which is a terrible idea and everyone who wants it doesn't understand the ramifications of that.

442
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:17,240
Speaker 0: Good Lord.

443
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:27,977
Speaker 0: But the right wing nut job, Osphere and the bots immediately reacted flipping out about how Twitter is dead.

444
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,740
Speaker 0: RIP Twitter was trending for a little while.

445
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,743
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

446
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,166
Speaker 1: It'll fix, it'll fix itself real quick.

447
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:43,800
Speaker 0: If you leave the bots all started tweeting, like all the same accounts that are promoting NFTs and doing all the weird crap, uh, the conspiracy anti-vax nut job accounts.

448
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:49,334
Speaker 0: They all started tweeting about how, oh, now we got a woke CEO and they're going to further restrict free speech.

449
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:51,520
Speaker 0: Even like Jack was our ally and now we're fucked.

450
00:29:52,281 --> 00:30:03,180
Speaker 0: And all I have to say to that is if, if that sentiment is even remotely true, or if it becomes true, because the people who are that evil are influenced by these botnets, good riddance.

451
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:16,179
Speaker 0: Like the fact that the right wing is afraid of this guy immediately is at least a positive indicator, not necessarily a sign anything will change, but it's one tiny positive indicator among a sea of neutral indicators.

452
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:16,880
Speaker 0: up to this point.

453
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:24,859
Speaker 0: I generally will always give slightly more benefit of the doubt to anything that pisses off the right wing nut job Osphere of the internet.

454
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,325
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

455
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:35,049
Speaker 0: So Scott, I have a question for you.

456
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:41,360
Speaker 0: What do you think is going on with the ozone layer like right now in the year 2021?

457
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,078
Speaker 1: Does it still exist?

458
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,220
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's, that's, uh, have you noticed that?

459
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Speaker 1: I thought it's completely gone.

460
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,560
Speaker 0: So have you noticed that like no one talks about it on the news anymore?

461
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:51,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause it's gone, right?

462
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,506
Speaker 0: Uh, no, we fixed it.

463
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,695
Speaker 0: That's why it's not in the news anymore.

464
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:55,720
Speaker 0: I will link to a video.

465
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,301
Speaker 1: What?

466
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,340
Speaker 1: How do you fix the ozone layer and still have climate change?

467
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,500
Speaker 0: Uh, because the ozone layer was not contributing in any significant degree to climate change.

468
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,319
Speaker 1: I thought it was deflecting, you know, UV harmful UV rays.

469
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,404
Speaker 0: It is absorbing UV radiation to.

470
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:16,140
Speaker 0: basically the primary thing the ozone layer does for the earth is prevent skin cancer and sunburns.

471
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:17,463
Speaker 1: Right.

472
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:17,664
Speaker 1: Yeah.

473
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:20,099
Speaker 1: But we're getting, I feel like I'm getting more sunburns.

474
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:21,644
Speaker 0: Actually the ozone layer.

475
00:31:21,684 --> 00:31:28,140
Speaker 0: So what this is, the reason I want to make this my thing of the day is that people, nobody realizes this, like it wasn't celebrated enough.

476
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,247
Speaker 0: This did contribute to climate change.

477
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:33,200
Speaker 0: Just not nearly as much as all the other things going on.

478
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:33,680
Speaker 1: Yeah.

479
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,538
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, they acted like the hole in the ozone layer was like the number one terror.

480
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:53,200
Speaker 0: Because at the time it was partly because unlike climate change overall, which extremely naive, ignorant and evil people will minimize because it does, they don't perceive it as affecting them directly and personally right now.

481
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:58,900
Speaker 0: The ozone layer scared the shit out of people because people have gotten sunburns before.

482
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,672
Speaker 0: People in Australia could literally say, look, it's getting worse.

483
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:05,140
Speaker 0: Like there was clear preponderance of evidence.

484
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:11,254
Speaker 0: It was a real problem that people identified with partly because the media talked about it a lot.

485
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:13,960
Speaker 0: And this video will talk about sort of how that happened.

486
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,121
Speaker 0: Do you realize?

487
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:29,280
Speaker 0: the treaty where the nations of the world agreed to ban CFCs, migrate away from them and take action on the first climate change thing we ever did was the only unanimous vote in the history of the United Nations.

488
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,440
Speaker 0: Every nation on earth.

489
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,713
Speaker 1: CFCs weren't that important that people had some industrial corporate or maybe that was a lesson learned.

490
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:39,757
Speaker 1: The corporate people were like, fuck, we lost that one.

491
00:32:39,777 --> 00:32:40,639
Speaker 1: And they learned their lesson.

492
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:41,340
Speaker 1: They never lost again.

493
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:41,981
Speaker 0: That was part of it.

494
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,843
Speaker 0: The corporate people realized they lost that one.

495
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:45,505
Speaker 0: There were alternatives.

496
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:46,466
Speaker 0: They just cost more.

497
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:58,980
Speaker 0: But more importantly, the nations of the world were under extreme pressure from the general population of people who had access to media because of this drumbeat of how dangerous the ozone layer depletion was.

498
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,244
Speaker 0: And it came down to the fact that it affected people directly.

499
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:06,588
Speaker 0: There was a clear consensus among media and scientists.

500
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:10,453
Speaker 0: There was a specific action that could be taken.

501
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:16,980
Speaker 0: And that action did not significantly impact the profits of the companies that have a profit motive.

502
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,702
Speaker 0: So we succeeded.

503
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:27,290
Speaker 0: And actually, the ozone layer as of now started healing rapidly as these changes were enacted.

504
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:35,499
Speaker 0: And it is on track to, by the year 2060, be literally back at 100 percent of its efficacy pre CFCs.

505
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:36,721
Speaker 1: All right.

506
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:38,735
Speaker 1: Well, it's not preventing any floods from happening.

507
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:39,419
Speaker 1: So what good is it?

508
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,999
Speaker 0: Because if we had not solved this problem, we would have so many more problems right now.

509
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,902
Speaker 0: I suppose it's a huge deal.

510
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,505
Speaker 0: The ozone layer is instrumental in the fact that life even existed on Earth in the first place.

511
00:33:51,566 --> 00:34:06,380
Speaker 0: So what this means is that, one, we can deal with climate change if the people of the world agree that we are going to deal with climate change and we force the governments of the world to do it.

512
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,204
Speaker 0: We can't do it ourselves.

513
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,909
Speaker 0: We can't force corporations to do it because they don't give a shit.

514
00:34:11,311 --> 00:34:13,656
Speaker 0: We need to get the governments to take action.

515
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:15,279
Speaker 0: And it was able to be done once.

516
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:25,580
Speaker 0: I think the main thing that's different now is that during the time of the ozone layer crisis, because it was an imminent crisis, like it was depleting fast.

517
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:31,368
Speaker 0: We basically were able to force action partly because there was no counter narrative.

518
00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:37,920
Speaker 0: There was no like government of the world, no political party of a powerful nation like, say, the United States.

519
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,505
Speaker 0: Just saying that this was false.

520
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:46,260
Speaker 0: Nobody, even the American Republican Party did not say that the ozone layer was not depleting.

521
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,620
Speaker 1: They actually, if that happened now, they probably would be like, there's no such thing as ozone layer.

522
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,181
Speaker 0: They absolutely would.

523
00:34:52,842 --> 00:35:03,400
Speaker 0: I think the political climate is so much more toxic, especially in America among conservatives, that short of destroying the American Republican Party and parties like it all around the world and ending the global rise of fascism.

524
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:07,646
Speaker 0: I don't think we can get the kind of global consensus we got about the ozone layer.

525
00:35:07,926 --> 00:35:09,188
Speaker 0: And I don't know what to do about that.

526
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:10,671
Speaker 0: But at least watch this video.

527
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:20,646
Speaker 0: It's only eight minutes long and you will see how this was one of the few times in human history the nation of the world got together and did the right thing and it worked.

528
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:29,760
Speaker 0: And I think part of the overarching problem is that we didn't celebrate that and didn't continue to celebrate that enough.

529
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:32,486
Speaker 0: And it contributes to this feeling of hopelessness.

530
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:35,494
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

531
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:37,259
Speaker 0: This is a really good video and I encourage you to watch it.

532
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:37,620
Speaker 0: What do you got?

533
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,485
Speaker 1: So there's this guy, Florida man.

534
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:46,330
Speaker 1: He's fishing because that's what happens a lot in Florida.

535
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,412
Speaker 1: There's a lot of fishing down there.

536
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:52,560
Speaker 1: He catches a shark, not a huge shark, but it's still a shark technically, right?

537
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,161
Speaker 1: He's reeling it in.

538
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:55,804
Speaker 1: He's reeling it in.

539
00:35:57,306 --> 00:35:59,629
Speaker 1: And then a bald eagle comes and grabs a shark.

540
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,635
Speaker 1: And it was caught on video, the whole thing.

541
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:07,460
Speaker 1: And it was a good scene despite being a scene of Florida man.

542
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:12,072
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's worth a watch here.

543
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,780
Speaker 1: It'll only take a couple of minutes, right?

544
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,269
Speaker 0: It's godspeed bald eagle.

545
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:19,049
Speaker 1: I love- And then Florida man wisely is like, nope, you can have it.

546
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,480
Speaker 1: It's like, let the bird have the fish.

547
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:27,094
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the geek nights book club book, Taylor Genji.

548
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:28,520
Speaker 0: I'm reading it actually.

549
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:39,100
Speaker 0: Gonna do the show probably toward the end of the year or right at the start of the new year because we tend to skip a bunch of shows during the terminal holidays at the end of the year.

550
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,752
Speaker 1: But I only have two more days of work.

551
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:42,677
Speaker 1: So, you know.

552
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,022
Speaker 0: Yeah.

553
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,967
Speaker 0: Our last PAX panel, Atari Game Design, is up on YouTube.

554
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:54,120
Speaker 0: I will be by myself at PAX Unplugged just on Friday, just to do a panel at 1 p.m Rare Game Mechanics.

555
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:06,860
Speaker 0: If you are not already planning to go to PAX Unplugged, I tell you straight up, the video of this panel, the slides and everything, will be on YouTube before PAX Unplugged ends for you to watch from the comfort and safety of your home.

556
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,848
Speaker 0: And yeah, otherwise, let's get right into it.

557
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:13,277
Speaker 0: We did a holiday gaming gift guide last week.

558
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,220
Speaker 0: You can listen to that.

559
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:20,098
Speaker 0: And today we're going to do a technology, computing, science, et cetera, holiday 2021 gift gaming guide.

560
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:30,800
Speaker 1: Now we did do, you know, the gaming one has a lot of overlap with the technology one because video games and technology have a lot of overlap, right?

561
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,928
Speaker 1: So, for example, we said you could get someone an HDPC, right?

562
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:37,653
Speaker 1: Or you could get someone a 3080.

563
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:39,456
Speaker 1: Those are also great gaming gifts.

564
00:37:40,198 --> 00:37:41,300
Speaker 1: I mean, tech gifts.

565
00:37:42,543 --> 00:37:43,006
Speaker 1: See?

566
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,316
Speaker 1: Same deal, right?

567
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:44,699
Speaker 1: You know.

568
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,600
Speaker 0: But I guess we'll try to avoid recapping any stuff that we talked about in that episode.

569
00:37:50,221 --> 00:38:06,540
Speaker 0: And I think one of the best tech gifts I can think of that I would give to a friend is actually if you have a friend where you've been in their house or apartment and you see what a technologist would call a dire technology situation.

570
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:12,390
Speaker 0: Like they've got 20 one hole USB chargers plugged into like a power strip.

571
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:18,460
Speaker 0: or they've got like not an HDPC, but like a proprietary broken streaming thing.

572
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:30,499
Speaker 0: Like if you see something in a friend's house or apartment that is easily fixed by a single device that you know exists, one of the best gifts you could buy is to buy the person that gift.

573
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:37,832
Speaker 0: Buy them the Anker like 10 hole charger to replace the power strip with 10 individual USB chargers on it.

574
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:42,320
Speaker 0: I know you've seen those kinds of situations in friend's apartments and you know.

575
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:45,044
Speaker 1: If someone's a tech person, right?

576
00:38:45,084 --> 00:38:46,726
Speaker 1: They already know what's going on.

577
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:55,999
Speaker 1: But if they're not and you are, then it's like you can, you know, how many times do I go and talk to people and I'm like, you really should do things this way.

578
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,500
Speaker 1: It's better.

579
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,542
Speaker 1: Oh, that never works.

580
00:38:57,943 --> 00:38:59,286
Speaker 0: It works on me.

581
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:00,829
Speaker 0: It works on a technologist.

582
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,456
Speaker 0: But your random friend, if you're like, hey, you should really get a USB.

583
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:04,757
Speaker 0: They don't.

584
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:05,859
Speaker 0: They have already tuned out.

585
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:06,440
Speaker 0: They've heard of you before.

586
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,722
Speaker 1: I do things a certain way.

587
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:09,967
Speaker 1: I know it's the better way of doing things.

588
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:10,267
Speaker 1: Right.

589
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:16,319
Speaker 1: But if I try to tell people to do things my way, they just argue and complain and they don't, you know, they're like, whatever.

590
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:16,860
Speaker 1: Right.

591
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:24,929
Speaker 1: But if it's gift time, if you buy them the thing, they have it now, it's not something for them to go buy, even if you set it up for them.

592
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:34,440
Speaker 1: Right now, they suddenly they're forced to experience just once or see just once that your way is better.

593
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:45,300
Speaker 0: But you're saying now this is really good instead of upset that you were, you know, this is really a gift for you so that the next time you visit them, you don't have to see that problem again.

594
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:46,321
Speaker 1: Right.

595
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:55,380
Speaker 1: It's like you tell someone, you know, hey, you know, a ten hole charger would be a whole lot better than all those, you know, power strip plus all these little individual charges and they don't care.

596
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,809
Speaker 1: But then if you get rid of that thing and put the ten hole charger there, here's a gift for you.

597
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:07,580
Speaker 1: Then it'll be apparent to them like, oh, you might not get credit for being right, but that doesn't matter.

598
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:11,860
Speaker 1: What matters is that they're now using their life has been bettered.

599
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:23,240
Speaker 0: And along those lines, if it's a more advanced gift and this kind of edges into the ultimate advice we gave during the gaming episode, which I won't spoil, you can listen to that.

600
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:27,850
Speaker 0: But here you can, if you're willing, this is not for the faint of heart.

601
00:40:28,331 --> 00:40:29,734
Speaker 0: You could give the gift of.

602
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:32,240
Speaker 0: here is the piece of technology that solves your problem.

603
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:39,028
Speaker 0: And I will actually like come to your stupid place and actually set it up for you with you.

604
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:40,049
Speaker 0: I'll deal with it.

605
00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:49,720
Speaker 0: I'll set up that wireless router that I bought to replace the like charred, barely working, filled with dust Comcast router that you've been using for 20 years.

606
00:40:50,640 --> 00:41:01,680
Speaker 1: Now, if somebody is all obstinate, right, and they even gifting it to them won't make them accept your superior technology way of doing things, then what you should do is you should go opposite.

607
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,260
Speaker 1: Right.

608
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,905
Speaker 1: So let's say somebody like go in and sabotage their shit.

609
00:41:07,107 --> 00:41:16,080
Speaker 1: No, what you can do, though, is like, let's say, you know, you're like, hey, you should really use a better word processor than that, like, you know, old junky open office or whatever.

610
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,561
Speaker 1: Right.

611
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,563
Speaker 1: It's something like that.

612
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:20,446
Speaker 1: And they just won't.

613
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:30,060
Speaker 1: Even if you like buy them a Microsoft Office subscription or something, then what you could do, you know, you should get that person a typewriter or like a fountain pen.

614
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:30,842
Speaker 1: All right.

615
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:32,165
Speaker 1: Just like, all right.

616
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:33,267
Speaker 1: You don't want to do technology.

617
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:33,508
Speaker 1: Fine.

618
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:34,610
Speaker 1: I'll get you the old technology.

619
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:35,252
Speaker 1: Here you go.

620
00:41:35,572 --> 00:41:37,998
Speaker 0: That's basically that's just a wrapped up middle fingers.

621
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:38,539
Speaker 0: What that is.

622
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,204
Speaker 1: But maybe they'll like, you know, they might like that.

623
00:41:41,304 --> 00:41:44,148
Speaker 1: if they're, you know, it still could be conceived.

624
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:44,569
Speaker 1: It's not.

625
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,713
Speaker 1: I'm not just saying give someone a fuck you gift.

626
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:46,993
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:51,240
Speaker 1: It still can be conceived as like a get, you know, a good gift.

628
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,563
Speaker 1: Like here, have a typewriter.

629
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:52,864
Speaker 1: Right.

630
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:53,706
Speaker 1: It's like it works.

631
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:54,889
Speaker 1: This ain't his paper.

632
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:59,500
Speaker 1: Like, you know, don't give something like antique to decorate their house or some bird.

633
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,703
Speaker 0: So I had an adjacent idea, but not very similar.

634
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:03,984
Speaker 0: You just suggested.

635
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:20,620
Speaker 0: But I am this more at someone who has kids or a kid, you know, one of the coolest gifts you could give to a kid who's the right age and has the right interest is an old piece of technology that could be fun to fuck around with or play with in some way.

636
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:37,196
Speaker 1: Kids are super easy because if even if you can't find like an old retro computer to give them like a spectrum or something, there are so many like kid oriented technology products out there that are like somewhere between school and fun.

637
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:41,199
Speaker 1: Like, you know, what's that Raspberry Pi that comes inside a keyboard thing?

638
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:41,780
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

639
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,260
Speaker 1: Model.

640
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:43,121
Speaker 1: Right.

641
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:46,183
Speaker 1: Or, uh, you know, there's just so many out there.

642
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:52,388
Speaker 0: or even just like I once gave a gift to a kid just like in high school of an old Atari because we had a bunch of them laying around.

643
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:54,249
Speaker 0: And yeah, these are old busted games.

644
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:57,271
Speaker 0: But that kid, this was like a six year old.

645
00:42:57,652 --> 00:42:59,853
Speaker 0: They hadn't really like they didn't have a gaming console.

646
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:02,755
Speaker 0: That was something some cool piece of technology they could just mess with.

647
00:43:02,775 --> 00:43:04,237
Speaker 0: And if they break it, who cares?

648
00:43:04,337 --> 00:43:08,880
Speaker 1: This agent broken Atari like the Raspberry Pi 400 personal computer kit.

649
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,682
Speaker 1: Like that's a gift for a lot of people.

650
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:23,854
Speaker 1: If somebody doesn't need any 3D anything, that's you know, and it doesn't need like a laptop like that is actually maybe the best desktop computer just period for a lot of people.

651
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:30,160
Speaker 1: But especially for a kid who's going to mess around and, you know, have fun with technology and chips and biz.

652
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:44,950
Speaker 0: But there's a big caveat, especially with a kid, if it's anything that could be used for like projects or crafting or something like an Arduino or Raspberry, you either have to load it up with some interesting experiences that take almost no effort to get going to sort of prime the pump.

653
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:51,454
Speaker 0: Or you have to also part of the gift is, hey, I'll help you set it up or let's play with it together.

654
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:52,375
Speaker 0: Like get them going.

655
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:53,996
Speaker 0: If you just get somebody can't?

656
00:43:54,036 --> 00:43:55,217
Speaker 1: you can't just buy the core.

657
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,978
Speaker 1: You got to get some accessories on there.

658
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:59,980
Speaker 0: Just buying someone an Arduino has bought them an obligation.

659
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,303
Speaker 0: It's like them an Arduino and helping them start the project.

660
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:06,204
Speaker 0: that's going to be cool.

661
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:07,705
Speaker 0: That is a gift.

662
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:08,965
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

663
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:09,406
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

664
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:12,768
Speaker 0: Unless the person said, I want an Arduino, like, obviously.

665
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:14,049
Speaker 1: Yeah.

666
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:24,216
Speaker 1: Because, you know, if you're buying something that's, you know, complex, it's like, yeah, you have to provide enough support that they can actually do something with it as opposed to just like, what the hell do I do with this?

667
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:28,959
Speaker 1: Oh, I know I have to go and buy you get me an apple to great beating him any drives.

668
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:30,180
Speaker 1: There's no drives whatsoever.

669
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,361
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, great.

670
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:33,963
Speaker 0: I do a cool old computer.

671
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:34,643
Speaker 0: I turn it on.

672
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:35,524
Speaker 0: Nothing happens.

673
00:44:35,544 --> 00:44:36,764
Speaker 0: What the fuck is this, dad?

674
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:41,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can code in basic in RAM and that's it.

675
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:43,009
Speaker 1: Fantastic.

676
00:44:43,069 --> 00:45:00,140
Speaker 0: And last one along those lines, if you know someone who has a computer that's perfectly fine for them, but it's got a like one single spinning disk in it, buy the cheap SSD and help and sit there and migrate their windows install to that SSD.

677
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,981
Speaker 0: And walk away from that computer.

678
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,322
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

679
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:09,688
Speaker 0: All they'll know is, yeah, Scott fucked with my computer and now it's ten times faster and nothing changed.

680
00:45:10,628 --> 00:45:10,748
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

681
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:19,796
Speaker 1: So if somebody actually knows what the hell's going on about technology, right, there's only really a couple categories of stuff you can get them.

682
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:21,957
Speaker 1: that is going to.

683
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:22,538
Speaker 1: it's going to.

684
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:25,320
Speaker 1: they're not going to know or already have or whatever.

685
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:25,560
Speaker 1: Right.

686
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,023
Speaker 1: So the first one is the it basically the expensive category.

687
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,145
Speaker 1: They didn't buy it for themselves because it cost a fortune.

688
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:32,525
Speaker 1: Yeah.

689
00:45:32,545 --> 00:45:32,745
Speaker 1: Right.

690
00:45:33,245 --> 00:45:35,567
Speaker 1: So, for example, get someone a drone.

691
00:45:35,587 --> 00:45:36,127
Speaker 1: Right.

692
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:38,029
Speaker 1: What nerd won't love to have a drone?

693
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,270
Speaker 0: I don't want to spend like three hundred bucks on a drone.

694
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:40,811
Speaker 0: But guess what?

695
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:46,014
Speaker 0: If a drone just appeared in this room right now, I'd be outside playing with it right now instead of doing it.

696
00:45:46,274 --> 00:45:47,695
Speaker 1: It'd be very illegal to do so.

697
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:49,997
Speaker 1: But it's like, yeah, I will never buy a drone.

698
00:45:50,277 --> 00:45:54,220
Speaker 1: But if someone wants to buy me a drone, I will have a lot of fun owning the dry.

699
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,963
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, but I would never.

700
00:45:58,443 --> 00:46:00,605
Speaker 1: even if the price went way down, I wouldn't buy one.

701
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,386
Speaker 1: But I'll take a free one.

702
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:09,171
Speaker 0: Got to be careful, though, because those kinds of gifts can almost edge into what I consider a whole category of tech gifts.

703
00:46:09,912 --> 00:46:13,194
Speaker 0: The sharper image, sky mall, natural wonders gift.

704
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:19,719
Speaker 0: You got to get something that's actually good, like drone, not like not the gadgets that you see in that store is OK.

705
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,402
Speaker 0: You know, the problem is even all my references are out of date, like natural wonder.

706
00:46:24,422 --> 00:46:25,744
Speaker 0: I don't think it's even a store anymore.

707
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,384
Speaker 0: Kids don't know where.

708
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:27,285
Speaker 0: sharper images.

709
00:46:28,225 --> 00:46:29,486
Speaker 0: There aren't even really malls.

710
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:39,414
Speaker 0: But if you're old enough, you know, in every mall in every town, there was that one store that sold weird gadgets and you could go into the store and play with the gadgets.

711
00:46:39,454 --> 00:46:40,675
Speaker 0: Your parents never let you buy them.

712
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:40,955
Speaker 0: Yeah.

713
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:42,176
Speaker 0: All that kind of store.

714
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:45,319
Speaker 0: Those kinds of gifts generally suck.

715
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:46,740
Speaker 0: They're terrible.

716
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,961
Speaker 0: Those are the gifts you buy.

717
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:49,382
Speaker 0: someone who is between.

718
00:46:51,144 --> 00:47:00,431
Speaker 0: I saw a much less charitable way to describe this, but someone who's like between the age of forty five and fifty five and has some money and you don't know what they want.

719
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:04,614
Speaker 0: But, you know, they're vaguely a yuppie and you buy him something from that catalog.

720
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:05,355
Speaker 0: That kind of gift.

721
00:47:05,595 --> 00:47:06,716
Speaker 0: Those are just terrible gifts.

722
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:11,580
Speaker 0: And you got to figure out where is the line between a drone and something from that kind of store.

723
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,642
Speaker 1: I think the line is somewhere around.

724
00:47:14,822 --> 00:47:15,862
Speaker 1: portable projector.

725
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:16,563
Speaker 1: Right.

726
00:47:17,944 --> 00:47:18,384
Speaker 1: It's a good like.

727
00:47:18,404 --> 00:47:21,326
Speaker 1: for most people, that's going to be something they turn on.

728
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:22,407
Speaker 1: Go, oh, cool.

729
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,008
Speaker 1: But it's not as good as a TV.

730
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:24,788
Speaker 1: Don't use it.

731
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:32,414
Speaker 1: But there's going to be that nerd out there who plays fighting games on the wall at the anime con and they want the portable projector.

732
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:35,976
Speaker 0: So you have that uncle who like the Mr.

733
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:38,658
Speaker 0: Dink, who's always showing off the stupid gadget they got.

734
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:41,600
Speaker 0: They'll love the shit out of a gift like that, even if they don't actually use it.

735
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,381
Speaker 0: That often.

736
00:47:42,661 --> 00:47:46,346
Speaker 0: And, you know, they'll bring it to other events and show it off.

737
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:52,753
Speaker 0: And then they'll always say, oh, yeah, Scott got me that there's a one really good gift.

738
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:58,320
Speaker 1: Let's say, you know, a nerd and they have a partner or roommate that you don't like.

739
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:02,023
Speaker 1: What you should get that nerd is a mechanical keyboard.

740
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:03,384
Speaker 1: The loudest one you can get.

741
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:07,847
Speaker 1: They'll love the shit out of it, especially if they don't have one already.

742
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:10,429
Speaker 1: Once they experience, it's like you could harp on them.

743
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:10,810
Speaker 1: Right.

744
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,271
Speaker 1: Like get a mechanical keyboard.

745
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:13,112
Speaker 1: The guy who cares.

746
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,353
Speaker 1: Once they get one, they'll realize how great it is.

747
00:48:15,614 --> 00:48:16,194
Speaker 1: They'll use it.

748
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:20,297
Speaker 1: But the roommate or partner will be very upset at the noise.

749
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,678
Speaker 1: Maybe they'll not care.

750
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:23,680
Speaker 1: But good chance they'll be annoyed by it.

751
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,904
Speaker 0: Now, if you know someone, this is this edges back into.

752
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:39,919
Speaker 0: if you've seen their apartment, if someone has like the original Logitech keyboard that like barely works anymore, plugged into the computer, get them a mechanical keyboard, but get them one with the quiet or the quieter keys.

753
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:46,164
Speaker 0: So it doesn't annoy anyone because one now they're going to taste of it and you'll bring them into the fold.

754
00:48:46,484 --> 00:48:51,268
Speaker 0: But two, they will, even if they don't say out loud that they appreciate it.

755
00:48:51,628 --> 00:49:01,816
Speaker 0: When someone types on a real nice keyboard after having used like a crappy old decade old, barely functional Logitech keyboard, they'll feel it and they'll feel better about their lives.

756
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:02,717
Speaker 0: Like there's this right.

757
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:03,958
Speaker 1: You could yell at that.

758
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:06,760
Speaker 1: You could argue with them to your blue in the face and they won't give a shit.

759
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:14,807
Speaker 1: But then the only time they'll experience it is if you give it to them as a gift, then they'll experience it and realize you're right.

760
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,628
Speaker 1: There's no other way.

761
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:27,900
Speaker 1: If someone already has a mechanical keyboard, a great gift is if you figure out what aesthetic they like and get them replacement key caps that are a better kind of plastic because I got those for myself and very happy.

762
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:34,119
Speaker 1: If someone has a lot of two factor authentication to get him some YubiKeys, that's a good gift.

763
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:49,092
Speaker 0: If you have a friend who's really, really not online or like still has photo albums, like can't deal with online photos, one of the easiest tech ish tech adjacent gifts you can get is using one of those myriad online services.

764
00:49:49,473 --> 00:49:57,800
Speaker 0: Take one of the image galleries you've tried to share with them for the last 20 years and just pay a company to print it out on photo paper and ship it to them in a little photo album.

765
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,981
Speaker 1: You could do the reverse.

766
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:13,552
Speaker 1: If someone has a bunch of photos, like an old person, don't buy them a scanner, collect all their photos and take them to a place and pay all the money it takes to get them to digitize whatever it is that they've got.

767
00:50:14,152 --> 00:50:23,860
Speaker 1: Video old VHS tapes, whatever, and then give them on a hard drive or a gallery in the cloud or whatever, all their stuff digitized already.

768
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:27,405
Speaker 1: Give them the URL as the present.

769
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:28,507
Speaker 1: Be like, "Here, click on this link.

770
00:50:28,848 --> 00:50:33,477
Speaker 1: Oh, look, it's all the old photos and VHS tapes that you had lying around, all digitized already.

771
00:50:33,817 --> 00:50:34,018
Speaker 1: Done.".

772
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:39,295
Speaker 1: If you give someone a scanner, they'll be like, "Thanks, I'm not going to sit there scanning all these photos.

773
00:50:39,315 --> 00:50:40,299
Speaker 1: What a pain in the ass that

774
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:40,439
Speaker 1: is.".

775
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,782
Speaker 0: Now, along those lines, Luke in the chat mentioned this.

776
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:45,444
Speaker 0: I had it on my list.

777
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:52,949
Speaker 0: If you're doing that, one of the things that everybody fucks up, especially if people aren't super techie, is they don't have backups of anything.

778
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:54,350
Speaker 0: None of their stuff is backed up.

779
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:58,634
Speaker 0: No technology you try to foist on them will work.

780
00:50:59,214 --> 00:51:07,040
Speaker 0: But buy them a year-long subscription to one of those cloud backup services that'll just back up a whole single computer.

781
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:08,442
Speaker 1: You could do that.

782
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:11,689
Speaker 1: You could also buy someone, if you get a lot of money, buy someone a NAS.

783
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,273
Speaker 1: Be like, "Here, a NAS for

784
00:51:13,313 --> 00:51:13,473
Speaker 1: you.".

785
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:14,355
Speaker 1: And then they'll realize,

786
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:14,435
Speaker 1: "Oh.".

787
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,642
Speaker 0: Or will they?

788
00:51:17,662 --> 00:51:23,677
Speaker 0: I have first-hand evidence of people being incapable of using a second storage device.

789
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:24,760
Speaker 0: they were given as a gift.

790
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,045
Speaker 1: Maybe.

791
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:26,778
Speaker 1: You have to set it up.

792
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:27,862
Speaker 0: You have to set it up.

793
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:28,324
Speaker 0: They just won't.

794
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:31,400
Speaker 0: Everything is just on C drive in random places, including group C drive.

795
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:35,940
Speaker 1: And then you install the program on their computer that syncs to the NAS automatically.

796
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,411
Speaker 0: Ah, but then you might have opened it up to the Internet of Things.

797
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:40,520
Speaker 0: They might then start syncing stuff all around.

798
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,370
Speaker 0: And if anything goes wrong with that, it'll break.

799
00:51:42,652 --> 00:51:44,040
Speaker 0: That's why I'm saying for your sanity.

800
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,332
Speaker 1: I used the Synology one.

801
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:45,980
Speaker 1: It's just fine.

802
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,083
Speaker 0: Eh, we'll see.

803
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:49,311
Speaker 0: I don't use that, actually.

804
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:50,496
Speaker 0: It just drives.

805
00:51:50,596 --> 00:51:51,480
Speaker 0: That's all it does up there.

806
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,954
Speaker 1: I have it synchronize my certain selected folders to the NAS on a regular basis automatically.

807
00:51:58,035 --> 00:51:59,578
Speaker 1: It's completely in the background.

808
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,140
Speaker 1: It just happens.

809
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:00,781
Speaker 0: Nah.

810
00:52:01,362 --> 00:52:10,480
Speaker 0: But I think buying a subscription to one of those consumer-friendly services that you click a button, install a thing, and it just keeps their computer backed up will probably save them.

811
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:20,380
Speaker 0: And also as a side effect of it doesn't change anything about what they're doing whatsoever, so you're not on the hook to do any support for what you've bought them whatsoever.

812
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:22,123
Speaker 1: Hmm.

813
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,217
Speaker 1: So most people out there these days, they might not actually have a computer at all, right?

814
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:29,200
Speaker 1: They just got a phone.

815
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:37,520
Speaker 1: So your technology gifts are going to be like phone-centric, but it's like what does anyone need for their phone that they don't already have, right?

816
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,662
Speaker 1: Everyone's got a phone.

817
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:41,108
Speaker 1: If they're a case-using person, they've got a case.

818
00:52:41,669 --> 00:52:46,100
Speaker 1: I guess you can get them a newer case if you find one that really matches their aesthetic or whatever.

819
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,549
Speaker 1: But it's like what can you get someone for their phone, right?

820
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:51,671
Speaker 1: Accessory-wise.

821
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:55,400
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's two things, and they're both photo-related.

822
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,180
Speaker 1: So it's only good for someone who's taken a lot of photos with their phone or videos in their phone.

823
00:53:01,981 --> 00:53:06,110
Speaker 1: You want to get those little lenses that attach to the camera on the phone.

824
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:10,700
Speaker 1: Those things actually work if you buy good ones, and there's a lot of good ones out there.

825
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,143
Speaker 1: It's like you'd be surprised.

826
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:19,520
Speaker 1: Your phone already has fucking three cameras on it, but it's like you want to take a long zoom or a macro photo or something.

827
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:26,376
Speaker 1: Those little tiny annoying little lenses that you could attach to the back of the phone, they actually work.

828
00:53:26,396 --> 00:53:27,900
Speaker 1: So not a bad choice.

829
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:33,553
Speaker 1: Also, kind of pricey, but you can get those little gimbals, right?

830
00:53:35,056 --> 00:53:36,500
Speaker 1: Screw your selfie stick, right?

831
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,840
Speaker 1: If you want to do steady cam video with a phone, there's plenty of little gimbals you can attach a phone to, and it'll let you do steady cam video with them.

832
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:48,948
Speaker 1: They're really good, and they cost maybe a few hundred dollars.

833
00:53:48,968 --> 00:53:49,911
Speaker 1: They're not that much.

834
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:53,600
Speaker 1: Not as much as the ones where you have to carry a full camera on there.

835
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:58,891
Speaker 1: That's useful for a lot of people, even if they don't use it that often.

836
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:01,800
Speaker 1: It's still really good and really nice.

837
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:05,220
Speaker 1: That's another thing that I'll take for free, but I wouldn't buy.

838
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:13,540
Speaker 0: One that's situational, but I think it's an easy gift because it's the kind of thing where if you have the equipment, it's so easy.

839
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,687
Speaker 0: But if you don't have the equipment, you almost don't know how to start.

840
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:21,140
Speaker 0: A cheapo sous vide kit, like a sous vide stick for cooking.

841
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:35,480
Speaker 0: A lot of people would never think to sous vide food, but if you give them one of those kits that's like the stick and the bucket and the really easy to use sealable bags, they'll start sous viding because it's so easy, and they'll have a good time.

842
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,545
Speaker 1: Maybe.

843
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,440
Speaker 1: You know, it depends.

844
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:47,640
Speaker 0: It can't be a person who doesn't care about food or a person who already has a particular way of cooking, don't get it from someone who has an instant pot because those things can also just do sous vide.

845
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:57,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think also in the category of accessory for the thing the person already has, no one can have too many watch bands for their Apple Watch.

846
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:05,720
Speaker 0: If you know someone has a piece of technology, accessories for that piece of technology in general are great gifts.

847
00:55:06,862 --> 00:55:07,163
Speaker 1: Yep.

848
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:18,718
Speaker 1: If someone doesn't have, even if some people, like I think a lot of people probably have Bluetooth speakers already, but if you know that someone has zero of them, having one couldn't hurt even if they don't use it all that often.

849
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,792
Speaker 1: It doesn't hurt to have one Bluetooth speaker somewhere, right?

850
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:24,400
Speaker 1: It'll come in handy for them at some point.

851
00:55:24,801 --> 00:55:29,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, not everyone's like us where I have audio equipment just like streaming out of my closets.

852
00:55:30,441 --> 00:55:32,065
Speaker 1: Right.

853
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:52,440
Speaker 1: If someone's, you know, really, someone still has a desktop computer or maybe even a laptop computer, but they're, you know, like actually somewhat of a technology person, you know, I have a USB floppy drive and a USB Blu-ray drive that I expect to be the final floppy and optical disk drives I have for the rest of my life.

854
00:55:52,520 --> 00:56:02,120
Speaker 1: I expect them to just work, you know, for the, and that way I never had to put one in any computer that I have because no computer is going to come with a floppy or optical drive probably ever again.

855
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:09,380
Speaker 1: But if case you have a floppy disk somewhere or an optical disk that you encounter, it's really good to have those lying around.

856
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:22,660
Speaker 1: If someone doesn't have one lying around or have a friend named Scott they can borrow it from, get them one and they'll be like, Oh, yeah, maybe they got a stash of floppy drives from middle school or high school that they can go dig.

857
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,399
Speaker 1: You know, they'll have a fun time checking out what's on there.

858
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:31,240
Speaker 0: Now one that, again, this is a more big ticket item, though you can get an old one used.

859
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:43,820
Speaker 0: If you know someone who does a lot of outdoor sports and they don't already have a GoPro or they don't have a lot of money, get an old GoPro, like a really old one, like three, four or five generations back.

860
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,862
Speaker 1: They're out, they are out now with the GoPro 10.

861
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:49,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a GoPro 9.

862
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,008
Speaker 1: I have a GoPro 5 and you know what?

863
00:56:52,129 --> 00:56:55,620
Speaker 1: The GoPro 5, it still does like 4K video.

864
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,940
Speaker 1: It's like, why would I even need the 10?

865
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:06,600
Speaker 0: Dude, my old GoPro that took that old clamshell case around it to protect it still did pretty good video for the, for like what I paid for it.

866
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,373
Speaker 1: So they're on the GoPro 10 with the, what is the GoPro 5 going for?

867
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:12,260
Speaker 1: Like a hundred bucks on eBay, right?

868
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:15,231
Speaker 0: And you don't have to worry about like, they don't wear out.

869
00:57:15,311 --> 00:57:17,740
Speaker 0: The only component of those things that wears out is the battery.

870
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,222
Speaker 0: And guess what?

871
00:57:18,463 --> 00:57:21,620
Speaker 0: You're going to buy bootleg batteries for old GoPros for like nothing.

872
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you can buy the official, I think, I don't think the battery has changed much.

873
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,560
Speaker 1: Don't quote me on that, but I don't think it's changed in quite a while.

874
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:37,201
Speaker 0: I mean, it changed between my two GoPros, I'm pretty sure, but my first GoPro is like the 2.

875
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:50,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the 10 is obviously better than the 5, but it's like, I don't... The only real feature of the 10 that makes a difference for me is like the ability to like do more live streamy stuff that the 5 can't do.

876
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:50,742
Speaker 1: But the same

877
00:57:50,802 --> 00:58:06,540
Speaker 0: thing goes for all sorts, like if you have an old smartphone and you have a friend who doesn't have any smartphone, you got an old smartwatch and you have a friend who doesn't have any smartwatch, giving someone perfectly good, just out of date technology is one, it's good because they can get some use out of it.

878
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,418
Speaker 0: You're not just throwing it away, but two...

879
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,140
Speaker 1: Good for the environment.

880
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:14,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it gives them a chance to see if they like that thing at all.

881
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:16,439
Speaker 0: Some people like smartwatches, some people don't.

882
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:19,719
Speaker 0: If you've never used one, you don't know if you like one or not.

883
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:30,940
Speaker 0: And some old LG smartwatch is a great gift to someone who literally doesn't have a smartwatch, so that they'll know if they would use it, like if they want to upgrade, if it's too old and crappy, they'll upgrade.

884
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:36,720
Speaker 1: Or you might give them a bad impression, like smartwatches are shitty, it's like I don't want them now.

885
00:58:37,124 --> 00:58:38,239
Speaker 1: I guess you gotta find the line.

886
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,380
Speaker 0: The problem with smartwatches is the iWatch is the only good smartwatch, and I've been saying that since the beginning.

887
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,600
Speaker 1: The Apple Watch, there's not as much a thing as the iWatch.

888
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:49,200
Speaker 0: I mean, whatever, it's an Apple Watch, I don't care.

889
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,360
Speaker 0: It's my iWatch next to my iPhone, my iPod.

890
00:58:53,020 --> 00:59:10,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the last thing that I can think of is that if you know what devices the person has, right, there's always gonna be like disposable or maybe not necessarily disposable, but like parts that need, right?

891
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,380
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, like you got a friend who has an Oculus or a Valve Index or something?

892
00:59:14,841 --> 00:59:17,859
Speaker 0: Buy them a couple of those gaskets that you can replace every now and then.

893
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:18,621
Speaker 1: Right.

894
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:22,880
Speaker 1: Or if you know someone does film photography, buy them film.

895
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,899
Speaker 1: Film's real expensive and hard to get right now.

896
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,327
Speaker 1: It doesn't even matter what film.

897
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,580
Speaker 1: Someone's gonna be happy to get any film.

898
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:36,338
Speaker 1: Someone's got something that takes batteries, get the battery that goes in the thing, right, because the batteries they have are gonna die at some point.

899
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:40,880
Speaker 1: SD cards, you know, can never have too many of those.

900
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:51,960
Speaker 0: You got someone who has a bunch of old devices and still uses like AA batteries and they're just using like actual primary cells, just buy them like one Eneloop charger and eight AA batteries.

901
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:00,210
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

902
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:05,350

908
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:29,370
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

909
01:00:56,410 --> 01:01:01,490
Speaker 0: I had huge side effects from my second Moderna shot way back when I got that in May.

910
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:06,589
Speaker 0: So we'll see if I have bad side effects now, but the side effects are worth it.

911
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:08,849
Speaker 0: So seriously, go get your shot.

912
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:27,031
Speaker 0: And now, I leave you with... [MUSIC].
