1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,689
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, August 12th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:10,051
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:12,942
Speaker 1: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,288
Speaker 0: - And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:17,080
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about natural disasters.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,757
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,220
Speaker 0: So, uh, right, we are about to do the show on time.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,280
Speaker 0: You know, we haven't done a lot of shows lately because a bunch of, you know, travel and personal stuff we were doing.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,140
Speaker 1: - But this is-- - And no shows next week either.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,045
Speaker 0: Yup, next week.

11
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:33,785
Speaker 0: So, uh, we won't be doing regular-- Which isn't out of the ordinary.

12
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,540
Speaker 1: 'cause there is a PAX West next week, not that we'll be at it.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,082
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

14
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:38,579
Speaker 1: - But we wouldn't have done shows next week normally.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,980
Speaker 0: But we were delayed doing the show today because I came home to find a copyright strike on our channel.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:59,740
Speaker 0: Which isn't that, like, copyright shit comes at us all the time, but it's worth noting that 100% of the bogus copyright things that have come to our channel in the history of our YouTube channel have been for anime.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,472
Speaker 0: Nothing else ever gets copied.

18
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:03,860
Speaker 0: It's only anime stuff.

19
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:11,840
Speaker 0: But in this case, it was an audio-only livestream review, like the live show where we reviewed Cells at Work.

20
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,240
Speaker 0: And the copyright strike, not a claim, but a full-on strike, was for nothing.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,220
Speaker 0: It was for, like, a still screenshot from the show while we reviewed it.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
Speaker 1: Which is absolutely fair use to put up a still image from a thing that you're reviewing, right?

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:43,140
Speaker 1: No, what I find, I'm pretty sure, so if you look on my channel, the only anime thing I've ever posted on my YouTube channel is the episodes where we did the Judge Anime by its cover, which contained still images from many anime.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:55,060
Speaker 0: - Oh, the Judge Anime from its cover from Anime Boston, and pretty much every anime review we've ever done, they have, not strikes, but they all have Sony or someone has monetized your video on them.

25
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,080
Speaker 1: - Oh, I don't know, I haven't checked to see if that's the case.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,586
Speaker 0: - Every anime panel we've ever done has that.

27
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,960
Speaker 0: The Judge Animes from the few conventions, we did them have that.

28
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:10,000
Speaker 0: Every episode of our entire show has that, and nothing else on the channel has that.

29
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,889
Speaker 1: - Let me just check here.

30
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:12,735
Speaker 1: Content...

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:24,500
Speaker 0: - But I guess that was annoying, so I actually had to deal with all the copyright strike stuff, because the problem is, even though it's clear, fair use, there's basically no upside for us to actually fight it.

32
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Speaker 0: - The actual answer here is that you basically just shouldn't ever do anime stuff on YouTube ever, because there's literally no upside for you.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,860
Speaker 1: - So the seven Judge Anime by its cover videos that I have on YouTube have no restrictions, no nothing whatsoever.

34
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:48,500
Speaker 1: They're 100% clean, even though they contain many images from anime, but those images are in a box in the top corner.

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,800
Speaker 1: They're not like a full screen, you know, I don't think I did too many full screen images, if any.

36
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:57,760
Speaker 1: And also, I didn't put the names of any of the anime, I don't think...

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:08,459
Speaker 0: - See, that's the key, because the videos that are getting these strikes have the name of an anime somewhere in the description, and it seems like we know, because Nintendo does this too.

38
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,200
Speaker 0: Anime companies are just like, they do literal illegal things with copyright, but there's no recourse.

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,646
Speaker 1: - I'm pretty confident.

40
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:28,580
Speaker 1: what they're doing is they just go on YouTube and they search, in this case, they search for cells at work, right, a show that they own the rights to, and they just select select all and push claim, they don't actually watch the videos or anything.

41
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:52,946
Speaker 1: And I think, you know, they could, you know, with, you know, obviously there's the perfect system, what they should do, right, but I think a minor change that they could make that would solve a lot of this would simply to be, when someone makes a manual claim like this, they should have to put in the time codes of the part of the video where the thing is and write down in text what the thing is in that time code that they're claiming against.

42
00:03:52,966 --> 00:04:00,393
Speaker 1: Like, ah, there's a screenshot of our copyrighted cells at work character at one minute and 20 seconds, right, it's just, that's it.

43
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:15,936
Speaker 1: And if they, if we just require that minimum level and verify that they're not just faking that, right, just put like the minimum verification so they don't just like put one minute on every single, put the same time code on all of them without actually looking, force them to watch the videos, at least.

44
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:23,330
Speaker 1: If they're forced to watch the videos, they can't just search for cells at work and click claim, claim, claim, claim, claim, right, that would become too onerous.

45
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,418
Speaker 1: They would actually have to watch them all.

46
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:37,706
Speaker 1: And if that was the case, they would have to, you know, or they would be focusing on the ones that were clearly easy to violate, be like, hey, this is literally an episode of our show that has been uploaded in its entirety,

47
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:38,329
Speaker 0: just

48
00:04:38,590 --> 00:05:00,717
Speaker 1: the whole, you know, they don't have to click a time code, they can just click, say, whole video, it's our show, next, right, whereas for our video, which, you know, a video that's fair use is a lot, it can be a lot harder, you know, they're going to skip right over when they see just two talking heads there, right, they're not going to waste their time watching an hour of geek nights to figure out where the the screenshot is up for, right,

49
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:06,320
Speaker 0: yeah, because this one in particular was manually created, meaning it wasn't YouTube flagging it, they went and found it.

50
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:17,903
Speaker 1: They let you know if it was like the automatic system that, you know, listens for music and finds a violation versus a human being whose job it is to search and click on things to find copyright violations,

51
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:18,787
Speaker 0: but I guess that's

52
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,233
Speaker 1: nice of them, they do let you know that.

53
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:24,611
Speaker 0: They do, but I mean, obviously the only actual solution to this is the U.S.

54
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:31,860
Speaker 0: Congress has to pass laws that radically reform copyright in fundamental ways and real protections for fair use, but that's not going to happen ever.

55
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:43,597
Speaker 1: So in somewhat related, you know, news, Twitch is now just on their own voluntarily, giving people who are banned from Twitch more information about why they were banned.

56
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:49,482
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, to the level that it needs to be, but that is a, I think that is a positive step in the right direction.

57
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,271
Speaker 1: It's like, we've banned you, right, why did we ban you?

58
00:05:52,331 --> 00:06:05,561
Speaker 1: You violated this rule and it was, you were streaming on this day, you know, at this time, this is where you broke the rule, this is just any explanation whatsoever, as opposed to you have violated our terms of service, you're banned.

59
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,606
Speaker 1: the end, right?

60
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:19,807
Speaker 1: Just a little bit of, you know, it's not full habeas corpus, right, which is not necessary, but it's, you know, along those same lines of, right, if you're going to try some, if you're going to punish someone, you have to tell them what they're being punished for, that core principle,

61
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:21,293
Speaker 0: but I guess

62
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:32,691
Speaker 1: it would be good if there was a law, probably won't be for many, if not for a long time, if ever, that, yeah, if you ban someone from your service, you kind of have to explain why,

63
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:33,654
Speaker 0: right, you know?

64
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:43,720
Speaker 0: But basically, because people don't want to risk their entire channel being deleted, they have no choice but to just accept these things and just let these companies take down their videos, give them strikes, etc.

65
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:57,432
Speaker 1: I think what we could do, what I would recommend people do is, you know, if you're a nerd doing anime content specifically, and, you know, you have a channel like, you know, Rims, which has mixed stuff, make a separate channel for your anime bits.

66
00:06:57,452 --> 00:07:04,524
Speaker 0: Yep, because, like I said, this is something we've, I've talked about this in public and in many other places, but we haven't really talked about it a lot in Geek Knives.

67
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:12,535
Speaker 0: This is the reason we, as Geek Knives, do not make a lot of anime content, like, we kind of, it is, it is a major reason, it is not the reason.

68
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,504
Speaker 0: Well, it's significant reason.

69
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:19,422
Speaker 0: It is the reason I have not made more antenna videos, because we would make more.

70
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:26,105
Speaker 0: I have actually, like, had lawyers write things to keep some of those antenna videos up, and it's just not worth the hassle.

71
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:29,961
Speaker 1: Like, I've never- We would make more than we do, if not for this.

72
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:36,810
Speaker 0: Well, like, JudgeAnimePad's cover is super fun to make, and honestly, doing panels and anime cons is also super fun, but, like, here's the subtle thing.

73
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:46,323
Speaker 0: If we go to a PAX, or a MAGFest, or, like, any other, any non-anime convention, and we do a panel, we can video that panel and put it on YouTube.

74
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,493
Speaker 0: We cannot put any anime panels on YouTube.

75
00:07:49,854 --> 00:08:00,674
Speaker 1: We can do that, as long as we do an anime panel that involves only us talking, with no screenshots, and no audio, or any content from the anime whatsoever, and don't do any of the fun, awesome types of anime panels.

76
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:06,577
Speaker 1: And then do not mention the names of any anime titles in our title or description on YouTube.

77
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,868
Speaker 1: Simply say, like, I judge anime by its cover, right?

78
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:23,175
Speaker 1: Do not include the names of any anime that would come into search, and don't put any videos or screenshots in the content of the panel, or, if you do, at the anime con, put the videos into your panel.

79
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:26,486
Speaker 1: When you do the YouTube, edit them out, so that they're not there, right?

80
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:38,407
Speaker 1: Put, like, a, you know, be like, you know, just put, like, a black box over it, and mute the audio, and put a subtitle that's, like, the opener to whatever is playing at this time, right?

81
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:51,422
Speaker 0: But without that mixed media, I find that anime panels, especially at the level, like, the kinds of content that, like, we would like to watch, and that people like to see at cons, that's, that pretty much removes the things people actually want to see.

82
00:08:51,462 --> 00:09:02,283
Speaker 0: Like, it does remove, yeah, you, like, for example, the most popular anime thing we ever did was, like, well, at cons at least, were the anime openers from around the world type panels.

83
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:02,926
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

84
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,052
Speaker 1: You absolutely can't do that.

85
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,439
Speaker 1: You absolutely cannot do.

86
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:16,294
Speaker 1: Which sucks, because that content is, but that, but that is a great content, but it is literally just playing someone else's stuff that someone else made, right?

87
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:18,080
Speaker 1: It's not something that we made.

88
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,186
Speaker 0: With transformative commentary, though, it is clear.

89
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:24,160
Speaker 0: It does have trans, I'm not, I'm not arguing against that.

90
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I'm saying is that that panel, as presented, is clear, like, unambiguous fair use.

91
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:38,188
Speaker 1: Sure, I'm not if you actually have something to say.

92
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,693
Speaker 0: Oh, so here's another example.

93
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:44,772
Speaker 1: We could make a panel that's, like, you know, the history of some such-and-such.

94
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,489
Speaker 1: You know what panel, like, our gaming panels with slides and text and, you know.

95
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:49,374
Speaker 0: You know what panel we did?

96
00:09:49,394 --> 00:10:07,025
Speaker 0: It was at one of the last Anime Bostons we went to that actually got, like, one of the biggest audiences we ever had in a room at an anime con was when we did that analyzing anime panel where we talked about Utena, and we, and the like 20 seconds,

97
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,030
Speaker 1: and then we

98
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,752
Speaker 0: spent 20 minutes talking about the allegory and the symbolism and, like, look, there's one cat, now there's two cats.

99
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,498
Speaker 0: Look at this frame of animation.

100
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:18,442
Speaker 0: What's going on here?

101
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,895
Speaker 0: That is compelling content, and you literally can't put that anywhere.

102
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,384
Speaker 0: It's just not worth the hassle.

103
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,032
Speaker 1: You could remove the two minutes of clip from it.

104
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,400
Speaker 1: Don't put the word Utena in the title.

105
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:44,220
Speaker 1: Put, like, analyzing a cool anime from the early 90s and your title, and then you would put a link to, like, you know, to say, "Hey, yeah, this clip that you should watch here is Utena episode three.

106
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,092
Speaker 1: Start watching it, you know, the third minute to the sixth

107
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:47,394
Speaker 1: minute.".

108
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you see what's going on here.

109
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,975
Speaker 0: That is all a hassle, and that is why the end result of all this.

110
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,925
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's not a hassle, but you can do it.

111
00:10:54,066 --> 00:11:04,447
Speaker 0: But I'm saying the end result of that, just because I've never said this out on Geek Nights, is that that kind of shit is why I don't even bother doing any anime shit other than reviews on the podcast.

112
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:05,731
Speaker 0: Like, I gave up.

113
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:08,018
Speaker 0: I made one AMV, never making one again, etc.

114
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,849
Speaker 1: Just don't, just, you know, do anime.

115
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,676
Speaker 1: Figure out something that you have.

116
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:19,426
Speaker 1: If you have something to say about anime, if you have a lot of knowledge about anime, you shouldn't need to actually show the anime, right?

117
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:26,280
Speaker 1: It's like if you take a Siskel and Ebert episode, right, and you just, you know, on that show, if you've ever watched Siskel and Ebert, they're both dead now, right?

118
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:33,847
Speaker 1: If you've ever watched that old show where they do movie reviews, they do show clips from the movie in that TV show.

119
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:45,852
Speaker 1: But if you edit out the parts with the clips from the movie, the parts that are just Siskel and Ebert chatting with each other are sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong, but that's a show on its own.

120
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,836
Speaker 1: You don't need the clips.

121
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:50,709
Speaker 0: But without the mixed media, it is far less compelling and a lot fewer people watch.

122
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:55,465
Speaker 1: It is indeed, but you could just upload the talking part only.

123
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,475
Speaker 1: You could do it and then they wouldn't come after you.

124
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'd say that defeats the purpose and ain't worth the effort.

125
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,034
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of reasons why you're never going to see more of those Utena episodes.

126
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:17,507
Speaker 0: Like, I'm just never even going to bother making that kind of content because that show, without showing a clip on the screen or a screenshot, there's no way to have the kind of conversation we're having because we're saying things like, "Look who's in the background in this

127
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:17,968
Speaker 0: scene.".

128
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,284
Speaker 0: So if you wondered why the Utena show is dead, that's pretty much it.

129
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:29,004
Speaker 0: Some other news that a normal, more traditional Geek Night's met a open-y bit.

130
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:31,995
Speaker 0: I biked home from work because I go to the office occasionally.

131
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:33,420
Speaker 1: Have I made the news yet?

132
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:34,864
Speaker 0: No.

133
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:35,969
Speaker 1: We're already going long here.

134
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:36,270
Speaker 1: Let's go.

135
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:36,511
Speaker 1: I'm hungry.

136
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:39,182
Speaker 0: We always go long because we don't do that many shows lately.

137
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,270
Speaker 0: We also don't talk except during the show.

138
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,595
Speaker 0: You don't need to talk about this.

139
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:44,100
Speaker 1: Let's skip to the news.

140
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,502
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

141
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,608
Speaker 0: Because this is my news too.

142
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:46,553
Speaker 0: This leads into my news.

143
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,579
Speaker 1: Oh, it's also your news.

144
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:47,840
Speaker 1: Okay.

145
00:12:48,040 --> 00:13:03,080
Speaker 0: So biking home today, one is like 100 degrees and two, I encountered the worst car traffic I have literally ever seen or experienced in Manhattan in the entirety of my life today.

146
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:13,210
Speaker 0: More gridlock than I have ever seen to the point that it was blocking bike lanes and it actually made my commute on a bike take almost 15 more minutes.

147
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:19,311
Speaker 0: And for context, that is more than 100% increase from how long it normally takes me to bike home.

148
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,557
Speaker 1: I don't think the U.N.

149
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:22,285
Speaker 1: is in session right now.

150
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:22,686
Speaker 0: Nope.

151
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,895
Speaker 1: I think that's the worst I saw was when the U.N.

152
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:25,618
Speaker 1: was in session.

153
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,502
Speaker 0: This was worse than that.

154
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:31,022
Speaker 1: It was only in certain areas because that, you know, in the detour zones that it was super bad.

155
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,367
Speaker 0: This was worse than that.

156
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:47,608
Speaker 0: And when I got home, I saw an article in the Boston Globe, which is my news, and it basically said that as of now, car traffic has reached or exceeded all the pre-COVID levels everywhere in America.

157
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:58,773
Speaker 0: And it's very notable that as this has happened, one, New York City, and there's other articles about this that aren't my news, traffic here is actually the worst it's ever been in New York City history right now.

158
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:00,580
Speaker 0: Just generally.

159
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:14,281
Speaker 0: And air quality is at historic lows because the only time the air quality was ever good in New York was that brief window during the terrifying heights of the COVID pandemic when nobody was driving.

160
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:20,120
Speaker 1: Cars have just- There were times, there was a time when air quality was good in New York.

161
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,345
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, before the car existed.

162
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,756
Speaker 1: No, it was- And before industry moved here.

163
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:26,980
Speaker 1: Steam engines.

164
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,334
Speaker 1: No, before then there were still horses and cows.

165
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,901
Speaker 1: It's before then, before any white people came here.

166
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:34,283
Speaker 0: That's why.

167
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,460
Speaker 1: But what's interesting is that- It didn't stink until the white people came.

168
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:38,763
Speaker 1: Pissed all over it.

169
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:48,925
Speaker 0: The car traffic seems to be the cause of the far majority of the like human recognizable pollution in the air here.

170
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,488
Speaker 1: In this area, yes.

171
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:56,522
Speaker 1: The biggest polluting thing in New York City is cars followed probably by power plants.

172
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,588
Speaker 1: But it's so hard to- I'm guessing.

173
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:07,937
Speaker 0: It's so weird to remember that year recently where New York City just smelled like the world as opposed to smelling like pollution.

174
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,264
Speaker 0: And now it smells like pollution again.

175
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:10,230
Speaker 0: The air quality is bullshit.

176
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:18,470
Speaker 1: Which leads right into my news that maybe with a new governor we could get the congestion pricing.

177
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,692
Speaker 0: Finally.

178
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:25,471
Speaker 1: So I don't know how if where listeners are or how much they know about what happens in New York.

179
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:26,054
Speaker 0: But you know what?

180
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,440
Speaker 0: New York news is global news.

181
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,492
Speaker 1: Sure, what country you're in, if you even understand.

182
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,542
Speaker 1: New York is a state, right?

183
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:44,317
Speaker 1: We're in the United States, but we still have a governor who is not the governor in the, you know, Britain pirate sense of governor, but is a governor as in effectively the president of New York.

184
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:49,796
Speaker 1: It's like you're the executive, you know, chief in the state government, right?

185
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,704
Speaker 1: The state, not New York City, right?

186
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,032
Speaker 1: The whole state includes Rochester, Albany.

187
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,320
Speaker 1: In fact, the capital is Albany.

188
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,463
Speaker 1: New York isn't even the freaking capital of the state, even though the governor hangs out in the city most of the time.

189
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:04,870
Speaker 0: People only go to Albany when it's time to do- Not that the governor listens to anything anyone in the city gives a shit about.

190
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:05,711
Speaker 1: No.

191
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:12,370
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the governor of New York has been Andrew Cuomo for quite a long time.

192
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:19,796
Speaker 1: His father was a governor previously, not the immediately previous governor, but, you know, a governor a while ago.

193
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:22,830
Speaker 0: He pretty much- He was well respected generally.

194
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,739
Speaker 0: No, not the current one, his father.

195
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,684
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

196
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:34,463
Speaker 1: Cuomo won basically on, you know, name recognition, which is very powerful in elections.

197
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:40,087
Speaker 1: And also because, you know, when you're a Democrat in New York, you got to get elected by the entire state.

198
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:54,642
Speaker 1: So even though maybe a lot of, you know, farther left people in parts of the city, as we could see with our mayor election, a lot of the city is, you know, center or, you know, even by some, you know, depending on where your scale is, conservative Democrats.

199
00:16:54,682 --> 00:17:01,664
Speaker 0: But if you go upstate, it's like, it is just like, I got guns and sail away.

200
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,168
Speaker 1: So Republicans can't possibly win.

201
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:08,989
Speaker 1: There's no chance for them in New York state, but conservative, if you're a conservative Democrat, right?

202
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,122
Speaker 1: Then, yeah, you have a, you know, someone like the president of the US.

203
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:20,936
Speaker 0: Because the entirety of the state outside of New York city will vote for that person in the primary and New York city will split across all the progressive candidates.

204
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:23,325
Speaker 1: And also that person.

205
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:23,626
Speaker 1: Yep.

206
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,674
Speaker 0: And thus that person will always win the primary.

207
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:27,883
Speaker 1: But no one's been- There hasn't been anyone.

208
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:36,272
Speaker 1: There just isn't a person in New York who has had the character, whatever, as a state figure to run against him and have any chance.

209
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:41,996
Speaker 1: So it's like, even people like me reluctantly kept voting for this guy because what the fuck are you going to do?

210
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,243
Speaker 1: Well, it's no chance.

211
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,395
Speaker 0: Like, you know, who runs against the Democrat in governor races in New York?

212
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:47,537
Speaker 0: Literal Nazis.

213
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:54,157
Speaker 1: So he's been the governor, even though basically everyone votes for him.

214
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:55,745
Speaker 1: And then it's just like, you know, we hate you.

215
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:57,172
Speaker 1: I voted for you, but I hate you.

216
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,823
Speaker 1: But there was no choice because the other guy's way worse.

217
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,196
Speaker 1: There's no- So he's been governor.

218
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,871
Speaker 1: He's been doing all sorts of evil shit the whole time he's been governor, right?

219
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:07,880
Speaker 1: People forget that in the olden days, right?

220
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:15,892
Speaker 1: Years ago, there was like this anti, you know, this group they formed, it was like a commission to find corruption in the state government.

221
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:19,690
Speaker 1: And they actually found one of his friends was super corrupt and put him in jail.

222
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,191
Speaker 1: Right?

223
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:20,772
Speaker 1: What's his name?

224
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,000
Speaker 1: What's that guy's name?

225
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,363
Speaker 0: I forget.

226
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,608
Speaker 1: What was the stupid guy's name?

227
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,272
Speaker 0: I mean, Spitzer.

228
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:30,334
Speaker 0: There's so many.

229
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:30,855
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

230
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:31,617
Speaker 1: That's older.

231
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,381
Speaker 1: Anyway.

232
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:36,428
Speaker 1: Oh, Skelos, right?

233
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:38,351
Speaker 1: Sheldon Silver, right?

234
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:39,694
Speaker 1: And Skelos.

235
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:41,839
Speaker 0: I forgot all about that.

236
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:42,781
Speaker 1: Yeah.

237
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,423
Speaker 1: All those guys.

238
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:49,378
Speaker 1: So basically that anti-corruption commission had a name.

239
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:53,893
Speaker 1: I forget its name, but it was going after it was started to look into Cuomo, right?

240
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,264
Speaker 1: It was looking into all the other state level people.

241
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,329
Speaker 1: It started to look into him.

242
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:58,614
Speaker 0: So we shut it down.

243
00:18:59,356 --> 00:18:59,758
Speaker 0: Nope.

244
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,464
Speaker 0: No more anti-corruption thing.

245
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,692
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, we found the corrupt people.

246
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,154
Speaker 1: We're good.

247
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,086
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like he could have been done with that.

248
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:07,508
Speaker 1: Right.

249
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,833
Speaker 1: But he, he survived that.

250
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,143
Speaker 1: And he basically survived a whole bunch of other shit.

251
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,794
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, during the COVID times, right?

252
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:16,765
Speaker 1: He's, he put in a big show of looking good, right?

253
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,494
Speaker 1: Not like the Florida governor looking bad.

254
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:26,265
Speaker 1: He looked like he was, you know, he made it appear that he had his shit under control and was, you know, doing a better job than the other governors.

255
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:27,854
Speaker 1: that turned out to be a facade.

256
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:30,549
Speaker 1: When you look at the nursing home shit, that could have been the end of him.

257
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,829
Speaker 0: The worst part is he was still doing better than most of the governors anyway.

258
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,082
Speaker 1: He was the whole IDC thing.

259
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,149
Speaker 1: People don't know about that.

260
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:50,144
Speaker 1: Or basically he, you know, he had Democrats who voted with Republicans that were like on his side in the state legislatures that he didn't have to move to the left.

261
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:52,211
Speaker 1: And then we voted them all out mostly.

262
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,856
Speaker 1: So that undid that business.

263
00:19:54,579 --> 00:20:03,323
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, so now finally what we finally undid him is like 10th scandal is that he was a sex pest.

264
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:04,867
Speaker 1: No surprise to anybody.

265
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:08,679
Speaker 1: You could just, you could tell by the guy's personality that he's that kind of person.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,124
Speaker 1: He'll just grab some asses.

267
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:15,400
Speaker 1: Um, but he got called out by some very brave women who came forth.

268
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,371
Speaker 1: Uh, and we, the attorney general came down on him.

269
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:23,843
Speaker 1: Uh, and now he's finally was forced to resign, which is great.

270
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:32,291
Speaker 0: Uh, and even, even better, it's sad that this is what it took, but, uh, there's so many other things we could have made him.

271
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,263
Speaker 0: Now we have the first woman governor in the history of New York state.

272
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:35,484
Speaker 0: Yeah.

273
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:41,568
Speaker 1: So the new governor who was the person who was the deputy or, uh, Lieutenant governor, right.

274
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:47,241
Speaker 1: You know, she's going to be governor and I guess in a couple of weeks, less than two weeks, she already now she's going to run for reelection when the cycle comes up.

275
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:47,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

276
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:51,477
Speaker 1: So Kathy Hochul from Buffalo, interesting thing, right?

277
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,842
Speaker 1: So what do you make of her?

278
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:53,183
Speaker 1: Right.

279
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:54,548
Speaker 1: Well, obviously better than Cuomo.

280
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,095
Speaker 1: She's not grabbing any asses, right?

281
00:20:57,116 --> 00:21:03,493
Speaker 0: So that like Zephyr Teachout is like still too far right for me in terms of the governor.

282
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:10,939
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, she, Kathy Hochul is interesting because she is, you know, probably too far to the right for us.

283
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,252
Speaker 1: She used to be even further right than she is now.

284
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:14,773
Speaker 1: Right.

285
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:24,830
Speaker 1: It's like, she used to be like, you know, almost Republican, basically she has moved significantly to the left, but basically it's an improvement, but it's not enough of an improvement.

286
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:48,408
Speaker 1: Uh, the good news is that when we get to the primaries, right, where she'll have to try to, you know, actually be elected, um, as, you know, governor instead of just, she was elected Lieutenant governor, but you know, whatever, um, you know, she's going to be running against, you know, uh, Jumaane Williams, who she beat in the primary last time.

287
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:51,996
Speaker 0: So, but Jumaane's power only grows.

288
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,062
Speaker 1: Jumaane's power has grown.

289
00:21:54,082 --> 00:22:08,039
Speaker 1: Uh, however, the person who took Cuomo down, Letitia James, also highly likely to run for governor and Hochul may have a very difficult time beating Letitia James.

290
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:20,017
Speaker 1: So we'll see, you know, for me to choose between, it's weird because for me to choose between Tish and Jumaane, that's a tough choice for me, but apparently they don't like each other.

291
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:28,150
Speaker 1: It's like, they're not big, they're not exactly friends, even though they, they were the past, you know, the current and former city advocates in New York city.

292
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:40,532
Speaker 0: But hopefully if we don't like each other, unless we, unless the state votes to get rid of the rank choice thing, uh, the primary, but the primary for governor is still going to be not ranked right.

293
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:44,469
Speaker 1: It's because it's not as, it's only as the rank choice is only a city thing.

294
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:52,095
Speaker 1: So it'll be a difficult situation there come that time, um, which may advantage Hochul, depending on who's in and who's out.

295
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,435
Speaker 1: Uh, but also what will be interesting to see is, uh, in a couple of weeks, right.

296
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:01,447
Speaker 1: Or Hochul is going to have to appoint a lieutenant governor.

297
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:05,097
Speaker 1: So that's going to be interesting, whoever that is.

298
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:10,979
Speaker 0: Um, and in one last little news that is actually really relevant of all the COVID things going on.

299
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:13,874
Speaker 0: One thing that's very important and I want to bring it up briefly.

300
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:14,902
Speaker 0: We're not going to get into this in depth.

301
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:28,469
Speaker 0: We want to get into the main bit, but, uh, for the future of things getting, looking better, the U S military, the Pentagon is going to require all service members to get the COVID vaccine, uh, basically within a month.

302
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:29,731
Speaker 1: Good.

303
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,477
Speaker 0: That's a huge deal.

304
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:38,899
Speaker 1: Does that only include, does that only include people who are like straight up enlisted slash officers?

305
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:43,415
Speaker 1: So it doesn't include like private company guy who's working on the boat.

306
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:46,189
Speaker 1: He's not actually in the Navy, but he's just, he's on the Navy boat.

307
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,025
Speaker 0: We don't know for sure because the official like thing is not out yet.

308
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:51,692
Speaker 0: We don't know exactly who's covered.

309
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,642
Speaker 0: We do know active service members are covered.

310
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:54,788
Speaker 0: We also know, I don't

311
00:23:54,808 --> 00:24:16,130
Speaker 1: know if people realize like just how many like private citizens who work for private companies are like on military bases, on boats, provide, you know, the food service workers are not, you know, I guess sometimes they might be people who are in the military, but a lot of times it's like, that's a company they're hiring to do food service or, you know, whatever.

312
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,477
Speaker 0: Here's why I want to highlight this.

313
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:23,404
Speaker 0: federal employees, but there's a bunch of other news is like a whole bunch of universities are requiring the vaccine.

314
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,134
Speaker 0: And so far all the whack jobs more and more

315
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:32,006
Speaker 1: places are basically saying, if you're not vaccine, you can't, or at least have a fake proof that we, you know, we're going to try to verify

316
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,565
Speaker 0: those nut jobs who tried to sue their university saying they didn't want to get the vaccine.

317
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:38,500
Speaker 0: The court just smacked them down and said, Nope, there's universities rules.

318
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,002
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

319
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:48,402
Speaker 1: But I think the big thing, that's the big thing that there's a rude awakening for a lot of those anti-vax people is, you know, they try to fake the religious exemption.

320
00:24:48,984 --> 00:25:01,755
Speaker 1: And if you try to fake the religious exemption, when it comes right down to it, they're going to check to see if you got any other vaccines, which you probably, and it's like the only way you can fly, even if you're lying about your religion, right?

321
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,525
Speaker 1: You're an atheist or whatever, right?

322
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:11,492
Speaker 1: Even if you're lying about it, it's like, if they see that you've had another vaccination, then it's, it's to your, your, that's it.

323
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:21,609
Speaker 0: I'm not a lawyer, but the way this has been described to me by lawyers in the past was vaguely that the government cannot litigate whether or not your religion is real.

324
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:23,739
Speaker 0: Like, obviously that's just the way the U S is.

325
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,236
Speaker 0: They can't be like, Nope, you made up, you made up the flying spaghetti monster.

326
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:27,819
Speaker 0: That doesn't count.

327
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,462
Speaker 0: They can't do that.

328
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,010
Speaker 0: That's why Scientology exists.

329
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:41,450
Speaker 0: But what they can do is say that if there's an exception or anything in the law, the thing they can litigate and test is whether or not the belief you profess is quote, sincerely held,

330
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:43,056
Speaker 1: meaning if they

331
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:47,312
Speaker 0: can show evidence that you're insincere, then they can tell you to go fuck yourself.

332
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:48,717
Speaker 1: That's right.

333
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,991
Speaker 1: So like, for example, let's say a Jew, I'll talk about Jews since I am one.

334
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:52,714
Speaker 1: That's fair, right?

335
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:54,341
Speaker 1: Says, Oh, work.

336
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,948
Speaker 1: You gotta let me leave early on Friday.

337
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:58,258
Speaker 1: I'm a, I'm a very religious Jew, right?

338
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,708
Speaker 1: They say, okay, leave, you know, Shabbos leave.

339
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:01,451
Speaker 1: That's what you do, right?

340
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,213
Speaker 1: This that's normal.

341
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:08,917
Speaker 1: Um, and then, you know, you bring in pulled pork sandwich for lunch into the office, right?

342
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:17,646
Speaker 1: Obviously we're not talking about situations like spying on you, trying to find out, you know, they're suspicious that, no, we're talking, you bring the pulled pork right into the office and you chow down and they see you doing that.

343
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:21,877
Speaker 1: They can be like, uh, so you can come in on Friday.

344
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,748
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, maybe it is what I gather.

345
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,854
Speaker 0: it might come down to that specific stricture.

346
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:36,763
Speaker 0: So it, those two might be unrelated, but if say you went on a bunch of vacations, like you did, you didn't do the Shabbos thing consistently.

347
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:38,991
Speaker 0: That's also true, right?

348
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:45,208
Speaker 1: It's like your boss happens to run into you on Saturday at fucking Disney world.

349
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:53,290
Speaker 1: It's like, and you're, you're lighting a fire and making two loops and eating the pulled pork sandwich.

350
00:26:55,254 --> 00:27:00,590
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, is that is the, uh, the Scott Pilgrim movie or like chicken parm isn't vegan.

351
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:10,062
Speaker 0: No, but, uh, but anyway, to get it before the reason I bring this up, here's why I think the military thing for active service members is important.

352
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:12,052
Speaker 0: And it's not something you would think of.

353
00:27:12,454 --> 00:27:17,856
Speaker 0: There are two things that people are not talking about with this that I think are way more interesting than the.

354
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:19,561
Speaker 0: we're getting a bunch of people vaccinated.

355
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:25,823
Speaker 0: One, the people in the military, their choice is not, well, I just won't get the vaccine.

356
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:30,378
Speaker 0: It is either you get the vaccine or you are dishonorably discharged.

357
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,642
Speaker 1: Yeah.

358
00:27:31,722 --> 00:27:35,314
Speaker 1: Or you could, um, try to find another way to get discharged in time.

359
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:35,775
Speaker 1: Yeah.

360
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:40,211
Speaker 1: You could try to get some other legitimate excuse to get out, which is not easy.

361
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:45,130
Speaker 0: Dishonorable discharge from the U S military is almost like an anti recommendation.

362
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,039
Speaker 0: The military is basically saying, fuck this piece of shit.

363
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:49,604
Speaker 1: Yeah.

364
00:27:49,684 --> 00:28:06,503
Speaker 1: Basically if you get one of those, um, in, in the United States, then if you try to, after that, if you try to apply for a job and you put military on your resume, any employers, HR department is going to, you know, make like this, they just contact the military to get your, your service record.

365
00:28:06,564 --> 00:28:07,769
Speaker 1: It's just standard practice.

366
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,922
Speaker 1: Like you put a college and they get your transcript, same thing.

367
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:16,713
Speaker 1: And if they see a dishonorable discharge there, you're basically that they can absolutely discriminate and not hire you because of that easily.

368
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:20,408
Speaker 1: And I've, you're very hard time getting a job basically anywhere.

369
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,626
Speaker 1: If you have that also, let's say you say, okay, I won't put military on my resume.

370
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:28,179
Speaker 1: First of all, you're gonna have a shit resume because he got high school diploma followed by nothing.

371
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:40,310
Speaker 1: Um, and second of all, uh, they could do a background check, which is normal for not all employers, but many, and they'll know that you were in the military and they'll find the dishonorable discharge.

372
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:43,081
Speaker 1: Doesn't be like the first thing they fucking find when they look you up.

373
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:45,851
Speaker 1: Um, and then they won't hire you.

374
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:53,439
Speaker 1: So, so here's why it's like, it's basically get a vaccine or have a hard time finding a job for a long time.

375
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:53,700
Speaker 1: So

376
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:10,044
Speaker 0: here's why I think that is very interesting because there's already some evidence that a lot of people who are very publicly against the vaccine, if their choice is the vaccine or their job, they suddenly just very quietly get the vaccine and shut up low or they stay loud, but they get the vaccine.

377
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:10,886
Speaker 0: And I don't care.

378
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:13,456
Speaker 0: if they get, as long as they get the vaccine, I do not care.

379
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,345
Speaker 0: Otherwise I just want people to get that shot.

380
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:23,558
Speaker 1: Now, this is what I'm about to say is obviously a very simplistic, generalized thinking that clearly is not a model for the world, right?

381
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,900
Speaker 1: It's a broad generalization, but you know, the image of this that I see is that there's some people, right?

382
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:33,828
Speaker 1: People with, with logic and reason, right?

383
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,082
Speaker 1: Um, and they respond to logic and reason and carrot, right?

384
00:29:38,162 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 1: It's like, right.

385
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:47,994
Speaker 1: And then, you know, and if you look Democrats, people on the left, right, we tend to be like anti punishment, anti prison, right?

386
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:54,099
Speaker 1: We tend to be people who like, you know, look at people like water protectors who were like, they believe they're doing the right thing.

387
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,447
Speaker 1: They'll go to prison for it.

388
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:55,929
Speaker 1: Right.

389
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,299
Speaker 1: You know, Gandhi's and Martin Luther Kings, right?

390
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,475
Speaker 1: People punishment does not, you know, change their mind, right?

391
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:08,596
Speaker 1: And they're the same people who don't believe in punishment of people that it's wrong, that it doesn't help.

392
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:09,399
Speaker 1: Right.

393
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,983
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, on the right, you have people who very much believe in punishing others, right?

394
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,890
Speaker 1: And they're like, yeah, you gotta punish people.

395
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,696
Speaker 1: That's what gets people's behavior to change.

396
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:25,253
Speaker 1: And yet they are also people whose behavior changes with punishment.

397
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:28,162
Speaker 1: So they respond, they respond to stick.

398
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:39,959
Speaker 1: So the people who don't respond to stick tend to not, there tends to be a correlation with people who they don't believe in using the stick to coax behavior out of other people.

399
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,965
Speaker 1: And they also don't respond.

400
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:47,042
Speaker 0: You stick somehow came to the thing, the thing I'm actually going to say.

401
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:49,711
Speaker 0: you came to it from a similar angle, right?

402
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:53,807
Speaker 1: People who believe in using the stick as a motivational tool, right?

403
00:30:53,868 --> 00:31:00,190
Speaker 1: Punish people to change the behavior of other human beings are people who themselves respond to stick.

404
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:08,271
Speaker 1: So what we need to do is if what I'm saying in general is true, then I think it's starting to happen.

405
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:09,758
Speaker 1: is we start with vaccine.

406
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,733
Speaker 1: We started with carrot and it's like, we got all the carrot people, right?

407
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:18,848
Speaker 1: It's like, if those people respond to stick, give them the stick, right?

408
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:19,711
Speaker 1: You believe, right?

409
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:25,231
Speaker 1: It's like, if that's true that some people respond to one thing and some people respond to the other.

410
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:29,670
Speaker 1: There isn't one way to motivate all humans to, you know, behave a certain way.

411
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,284
Speaker 1: Go to each person and customize the way you motivate them.

412
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:37,563
Speaker 1: Oh, you're not going to get a vaccine, but you will if I threatened to beat the shit out of you.

413
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:38,306
Speaker 1: Guess what?

414
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:40,135
Speaker 1: You're a person who responds to beatings.

415
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:41,099
Speaker 1: You get beatings.

416
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:50,219
Speaker 1: So if you don't behave, so you're a person who doesn't respond to beatings, I could beat you to kingdom come and you still would sit at the counter and wall greens anyway, because you believe it's right.

417
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:51,667
Speaker 1: No beatings for you.

418
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:52,190
Speaker 1: They don't work.

419
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,025
Speaker 1: Instead, we're going to, you know, do something else.

420
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:55,990
Speaker 0: Give you civil rights.

421
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,712
Speaker 1: Exactly.

422
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,279
Speaker 1: So we're going to give you what you want.

423
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:01,489
Speaker 0: For the last thing I'll say on this.

424
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:02,312
Speaker 1: That's all you respond to.

425
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,427
Speaker 0: The reason I brought this news up is it's one level higher than that.

426
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,473
Speaker 0: The US military, and I don't want to give, this could be a whole show, but we got to move on to the rest of the show tonight.

427
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:13,586
Speaker 1: Well, the military only uses, well, they use metals.

428
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:14,270
Speaker 1: I guess they have carrots.

429
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's carrots there.

430
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:16,658
Speaker 0: But here's my thinking.

431
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,933
Speaker 0: I have a hypothesis and I'm really invested in this.

432
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:23,080
Speaker 0: Like, I want to see if this pans out.

433
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:33,553
Speaker 0: The US military has a problem in that not the majority, but there is a significant white supremacist presence within the US military for a lot of reasons.

434
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:34,858
Speaker 0: There's a lot of...

435
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:39,015
Speaker 1: I mean, it's, I think it's slightly, I think from what I've seen, it's lower than in the police.

436
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,003
Speaker 0: Oh, definitely lower than in the police.

437
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:44,214
Speaker 1: It's still a shockingly large percentage.

438
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:51,141
Speaker 1: It's just not like 50%, you know, I don't know what the percent is, but it's not a tiny percentage, like one, and it's not 50.

439
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:52,226
Speaker 1: It's somewhere in the middle.

440
00:32:52,246 --> 00:33:04,283
Speaker 0: So that is like, like step one, like assumption one, that there is a white supremacist problem within the US military, a subset of the US military, are dangerous white supremacists.

441
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:05,407
Speaker 1: That's an absolute fact.

442
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:05,708
Speaker 1: Yep.

443
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,778
Speaker 0: So let's assume another thing that we also know is true.

444
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:24,350
Speaker 0: The overlap between people who affirmatively resist the vaccine for conspiracy reasons and people who are white supremacists, that Venn diagram starts to approach a circle far more so than other types of Venn diagrams in this space.

445
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:27,903
Speaker 1: It's not a perfect circle, but it's approaching one indeed, yes.

446
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:29,550
Speaker 1: Very strong correlation.

447
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,985
Speaker 0: For white supremacists in the US military then, one of two things is going to happen.

448
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:43,754
Speaker 0: Either they believe this stuff so much that they'll accept the dishonorable discharge and there will be fewer white supremacists in the military.

449
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,118
Speaker 0: Not zero, but fewer.

450
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:52,182
Speaker 0: Or the white supremacists want to remain in the military so much, they'll get the goddamn vaccine.

451
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:52,784
Speaker 0: And guess what?

452
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,154
Speaker 0: Fine, at least you got the vaccine.

453
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:58,950
Speaker 0: One of the things you're doing shilly in your life is less likely to kill someone.

454
00:33:59,592 --> 00:33:59,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

455
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:02,447
Speaker 1: If you want to kill other people, you have to kill them, you know.

456
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,219
Speaker 1: You gotta kill them with guns and systemic oppression.

457
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:08,150
Speaker 0: You can't kill them by spreading COVID to them without a vaccine.

458
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:12,030
Speaker 0: So that is the thing that I think is interesting here.

459
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,576
Speaker 1: It's a positive thing for sure.

460
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:24,634
Speaker 1: And I think in general, I think that more places in our society, it's like, yeah, people are going to fake their vaccination record and some places aren't going to check as strongly as others.

461
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:34,223
Speaker 1: But yeah, the more places that say, "No vax, not allowed to come in, period," I think that is probably sufficient.

462
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:40,762
Speaker 1: stick that will get us, I don't think it's going to get us 99% vaccinated, but it's going to get us well over the line.

463
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:47,443
Speaker 1: I think, just guessing, half the resisting people would probably be convinced by that eventually.

464
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:50,152
Speaker 1: As soon as they wanted to do something.

465
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:52,721
Speaker 0: Half of them get the vaccine and the other half get a stick.

466
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:54,286
Speaker 1: Maybe.

467
00:34:54,947 --> 00:35:07,505
Speaker 1: Well, the stick they get is, you're going to either have to get a fake thing or you're going to have... And I think put in some sort of a punishment for people who are using a fake or faking it.

468
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:08,007
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

469
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:14,212
Speaker 0: Well, if an outbreak happens and you're part of it and it's shown that you faked your vaccine, that should be a felony.

470
00:35:15,135 --> 00:35:16,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, a felony is fine.

471
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,707
Speaker 1: There should be a severe punishment for faking it.

472
00:35:19,229 --> 00:35:22,199
Speaker 1: But I don't think we should go around trying to find people faking it.

473
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:22,721
Speaker 0: It's not like...

474
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:27,273
Speaker 1: No cops standing at bars checking everyone who comes in.

475
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:28,455
Speaker 1: None of that nonsense.

476
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:37,509
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

477
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:40,667
Speaker 0: So we're laying blades in the dark pretty regularly through this whole quarantine.

478
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:41,531
Speaker 0: I fucking love that system.

479
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:42,153
Speaker 0: We keep playing it.

480
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:47,890
Speaker 0: And we interact with a lot of cults for a lot of reasons.

481
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,415
Speaker 0: We're doing a lot of cult stuff lately.

482
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,145
Speaker 0: So what I have here, my thing of the day.

483
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:57,781
Speaker 0: This is a Warhammer themed, but it doesn't matter that it's Warhammer.

484
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,951
Speaker 0: Warhammer happens to be a good avenue for this.

485
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:05,781
Speaker 0: This is a cult random name generator.

486
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:14,927
Speaker 0: And every single time you click generate cult name, solid fucking gold comes out of this generator.

487
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:15,550
Speaker 0: Let's see right now.

488
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,677
Speaker 0: The Sons of the Insatiable Twilight.

489
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,846
Speaker 0: The Covenant of the Baleful Onsop.

490
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,353
Speaker 0: The Descenders of the Perfect Sigil.

491
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,964
Speaker 1: The Fraternity... Is it always the something of the something?

492
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:27,345
Speaker 1: Yeah.

493
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,452
Speaker 0: The Fraternity of Conquering Pleasure.

494
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,939
Speaker 0: The Legion of the Nubile Beasts.

495
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:33,904
Speaker 1: The Nubile Beasts?

496
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:40,026
Speaker 0: So yeah, our blades in the dark game, every cult we encounter is just the next click in this name generator.

497
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:40,910
Speaker 0: And it is delightful.

498
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,771
Speaker 1: Okay.

499
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,316
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

500
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:50,259
Speaker 1: So there is a human being who is an amazing person that doesn't get thought of or spoken about as much as they deserve.

501
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:51,523
Speaker 1: And that person is Mr.

502
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:51,563
Speaker 1: T.

503
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:55,436
Speaker 0: Weirdly such a fixture in my childhood, Mr.

504
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:55,696
Speaker 0: T.

505
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:56,358
Speaker 1: Mr.

506
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:57,682
Speaker 1: T was big in the 80s.

507
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:00,410
Speaker 1: And then, you know, was still around.

508
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,574
Speaker 1: He's still around today.

509
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:02,116
Speaker 1: He's alive.

510
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:04,907
Speaker 1: But yeah, Nod is not as popular now.

511
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:05,450
Speaker 1: He's also old.

512
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,298
Speaker 1: But he was a big deal in the 80s.

513
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,894
Speaker 1: If any, you know, for example, I mean, you look at this video, that's my thing of the day, which is Mr.

514
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:14,461
Speaker 1: T on Letterman in 1982.

515
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,227
Speaker 1: This was, I was zero or one.

516
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:20,161
Speaker 1: I wasn't even one yet when this, or even when this, when Mr.

517
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:20,944
Speaker 1: T was on Letterman.

518
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:21,868
Speaker 1: So this was the height of Mr.

519
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:23,593
Speaker 1: T. This was Rocky.

520
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:24,937
Speaker 1: Was it three that Mr.

521
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,418
Speaker 1: T was in?

522
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:26,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

523
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:29,168
Speaker 1: Um, as a Rocky three was coming out.

524
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:32,197
Speaker 1: What's a Rocky three is as old as me and Mr.

525
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:37,173
Speaker 1: T was on Letterman promoting Rocky three in that same year that I was born.

526
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,961
Speaker 1: And that's what this thing of the day video is.

527
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:40,166
Speaker 1: So if Mr.

528
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:44,042
Speaker 1: T was at his peak when I was born, of course, he's only really going to be a fixture in the childhood.

529
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:50,405
Speaker 1: He wasn't able to remain a prominent public figure longer than, you know, 10, 20, right?

530
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:52,973
Speaker 0: I don't think people younger than us know.

531
00:37:53,194 --> 00:37:56,766
Speaker 0: I don't think people a generation younger than us really even know who he is.

532
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,541
Speaker 0: Maybe they know one quote, but don't actually know like why.

533
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:01,484
Speaker 1: I pity the fool.

534
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:02,227
Speaker 1: Everyone knows that.

535
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:02,629
Speaker 1: Yep.

536
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:04,516
Speaker 0: Everyone knows that even if they don't know where it came from.

537
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:05,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Mr.

538
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,334
Speaker 1: T is a fascinating, amazing, and incredible person.

539
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:18,387
Speaker 1: And you can really, you know, see, this is like, you can see what he was like that, like, this is what, like, he was just becoming more famous, like at this time.

540
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:25,272
Speaker 1: And you can see in this video, why he was able to become famous, like the, how the kind of person he was right.

541
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:28,041
Speaker 1: Um, allowed him to achieve fame.

542
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:34,296
Speaker 1: Uh, and yeah, I highly recommend, you know, I guess, you know, this was before fricking, uh, a team, right.

543
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:35,318
Speaker 1: He wasn't on that yet.

544
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:43,094
Speaker 0: Um, so yeah, you can, uh, a team ran from 1983 to 1987.

545
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:43,294
Speaker 0: Yeah.

546
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:48,712
Speaker 1: He, the a team didn't exist when he, when this thing of the day video was recorded.

547
00:38:49,816 --> 00:38:51,099
Speaker 0: God, this was a long time ago.

548
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,225
Speaker 1: I'm just as old as us.

549
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:53,386
Speaker 1: Yeah.

550
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,857
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, uh, we got no cons.

551
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,843
Speaker 0: Like we're not going to PAX for obvious reasons.

552
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:03,142
Speaker 0: Uh, in fact, we're specifically not going to PAX because it's too soon for conventions.

553
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:07,320
Speaker 0: Uh, but we'll see how things go for future conventions after this upcoming PAX West.

554
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:13,886
Speaker 0: The panel we did at the most recent PAX online is just on YouTube with slides, Atari game design.

555
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:14,569
Speaker 0: You can just watch it.

556
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,688
Speaker 0: The geek nuts book club book remains the tale of Genji, uh, to do a brief checkpoint.

557
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:20,913
Speaker 0: Cause I'm powering through.

558
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,940
Speaker 1: I'm about a little over a percent.

559
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,811
Speaker 0: I'm about, I'm approaching a third of the way through.

560
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:26,796
Speaker 0: I'm like 31.

561
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,444
Speaker 1: Let me check my Kindle percentage.

562
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:29,991
Speaker 1: Cause I actually haven't read in a little while.

563
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:30,493
Speaker 0: Yeah.

564
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,522
Speaker 1: But, uh, I might have to catch up.

565
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:39,066
Speaker 0: You might have to, but, uh, to checkpoint, cause you know, the last few episodes I said, look, I can just kind of sleep.

566
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:40,151
Speaker 1: I'm only, I'm only 19%.

567
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:52,180
Speaker 0: Oh, so, uh, now that I'm a little further, uh, the, the pedo thing just keeps that, that just bunny drops all the way through the rest of the stupid book.

568
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:52,742
Speaker 0: 100%.

569
00:39:52,742 --> 00:40:02,138
Speaker 0: And, uh, too, now that, you know, there's the, there's the incident where a ghost kills someone, he is banging in a haunted mansion.

570
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:03,985
Speaker 0: Like that happens pretty early on actually.

571
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:11,492
Speaker 0: But, uh, it is very clear in retrospect, like getting further into the book that his every Genji has malaria.

572
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:14,622
Speaker 0: He probably got malaria during that bit.

573
00:40:15,244 --> 00:40:19,018
Speaker 0: And cause you know, the people in that household were sick and then the woman died.

574
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:23,094
Speaker 0: And then later he's seeing the wise man in the woods because he has recurring fevers.

575
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:24,800
Speaker 0: Malaria was happy.

576
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,068
Speaker 0: Like malaria was a thing in hand area.

577
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:30,180
Speaker 1: I knew he was sick, but I didn't realize it was malaria specifically.

578
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,755
Speaker 0: fevers that would come and go throughout the rest of his life.

579
00:40:33,815 --> 00:40:34,539
Speaker 0: It keeps coming up.

580
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:35,706
Speaker 1: So I know that.

581
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,946
Speaker 1: I just didn't know that, that I just didn't recognize it as malaria until you just said something.

582
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:39,107
Speaker 0: Yeah.

583
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,357
Speaker 0: Like I just, I sort of, did you look, did you look that up?

584
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:41,578
Speaker 0: Nope.

585
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,944
Speaker 0: It just suddenly clicked.

586
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:46,178
Speaker 0: when yet again, he's having fevers and isn't feeling well.

587
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:48,247
Speaker 0: Just like, well, huh, that makes sense.

588
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:53,528
Speaker 0: And also all the people who died in that house with the ghost and everything, probably also just malaria.

589
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:55,696
Speaker 0: It seems that just seems to fit.

590
00:40:56,378 --> 00:40:57,764
Speaker 1: How come he hasn't died of it yet?

591
00:40:57,784 --> 00:40:58,988
Speaker 1: A lot of people live with malaria.

592
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,715
Speaker 0: Like you can just survive.

593
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:03,687
Speaker 0: And also he's only like 18 at that point.

594
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,369
Speaker 1: Oh, that's true.

595
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,212
Speaker 1: He's still kind of young.

596
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:05,473
Speaker 1: Yeah.

597
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:05,855
Speaker 1: Yeah.

598
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:10,070
Speaker 0: Like he is, he is now about 20 as far as I've gotten in the book.

599
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:28,623
Speaker 0: Like it moves pretty slow, but the only thing I'm struggling with, like the thing that I have the most trouble with reading this book, as I get further and further along, I'm used to a lot of the conventions that uses, but what I'm struggling with is how there will be like multiple paragraphs that are covering a span of like 10 seconds.

600
00:41:29,366 --> 00:41:35,769
Speaker 0: And then the next paragraph will be someone saying a line, but it is like a month later in a different place.

601
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:36,931
Speaker 1: Yeah.

602
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,600
Speaker 0: And there was no transition whatsoever.

603
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:43,152
Speaker 0: And it's almost like, wait, who, when did this guy show up?

604
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,618
Speaker 0: Oh no, no, it's a month later.

605
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:44,980
Speaker 0: Okay.

606
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,302
Speaker 0: Okay.

607
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:45,824
Speaker 0: Whatever.

608
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,049
Speaker 0: I guess I see what's going on now.

609
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,777
Speaker 1: Like it slows down.

610
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:51,924
Speaker 1: It's like describe a scene in detail.

611
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:56,801
Speaker 1: Like, ah, they're at the festival and so dances and then so-and-so dances and then so-and-so dances.

612
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:57,605
Speaker 1: really well.

613
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:58,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

614
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:03,309
Speaker 1: So, and so the other people do a shitty dance and then it's like his excellency has something to say to Genji.

615
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:05,199
Speaker 0: It's like his excellency was not at this party.

616
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,962
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

617
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:06,143
Speaker 1: Right.

618
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:06,686
Speaker 1: Right.

619
00:42:06,726 --> 00:42:14,580
Speaker 1: And then it's like, you know, it slows down to detail on something and then it's like, all right, the next part of our story is, yeah, you know, Genji's off to it.

620
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,503
Speaker 1: It's like, what?

621
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,952
Speaker 0: But it doesn't ever say the next part of our story.

622
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:21,966
Speaker 0: It's just the next, the next line someone says is months later.

623
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:22,709
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,076
Speaker 1: And then you restart the paragraph.

625
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:24,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

626
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:25,503
Speaker 0: And you're like, oh, okay.

627
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:26,650
Speaker 0: I think I see what's going on here.

628
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:32,512
Speaker 0: I'm glad the chapters all have a little bit like, here's, who's in the chapter and roughly how old Genji is.

629
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:33,496
Speaker 1: Yep.

630
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:35,583
Speaker 0: Without that, I was just lost.

631
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:40,319
Speaker 1: That's why you need this edition, the full unabridged, you know, uh, edition.

632
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:48,455
Speaker 0: I mean, from what I've got, like, even if you're reading it in the original Japanese, it's such archaic Japanese that it would be like us trying to read early middle English.

633
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:56,208
Speaker 1: I mean, Emily who, you know, speaks and reads Japanese, you know, way, I guess, is she technically, I don't know what counts as fluency, right?

634
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:57,353
Speaker 1: She passed the test thing, right?

635
00:42:57,453 --> 00:42:58,257
Speaker 0: She's close.

636
00:42:58,899 --> 00:42:59,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

637
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:08,277
Speaker 1: She says it's like, if you're, if you speak English, but you try to read Shakespeare, it's like, yeah, you read it, but you know, it's not, uh, it's not so straightforward, right?

638
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:08,438
Speaker 0: Yeah.

639
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:15,968
Speaker 0: I get the impression that Shakespeare is pretty easy to read relative to modern English compared to reading Heian era court Japanese.

640
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:16,169
Speaker 1: Right.

641
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:21,634
Speaker 1: But it's, I'm sure, I think it's, I think it probably is harder than us reading Shakespeare, but it's still the same idea.

642
00:43:21,654 --> 00:43:23,622
Speaker 1: It's, it's your, it's your language.

643
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:33,964
Speaker 1: You know, those you've seen those words, but you read the sentence and your brain doesn't actually create an image of what the sentence means and you have to, you know, like for, you know, consciously force it.

644
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:39,064
Speaker 1: But also it's like the difference between just breathing unconsciously and breathing on purpose.

645
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:45,309
Speaker 0: But also, you know, Genji, it's easy to say like, wow, Genji just like cries all the time because there's so many.

646
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:50,286
Speaker 0: you see where he just like, and then he spent the next three days crying and nothing else.

647
00:43:50,968 --> 00:43:55,980
Speaker 0: But, uh, got to remember he's like 17.

648
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,124
Speaker 0: So that kind of tracks.

649
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:58,970
Speaker 0: He's just this weepy teenager.

650
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:00,491
Speaker 1: Yeah.

651
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:02,377
Speaker 0: All right.

652
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:03,561
Speaker 0: Let's get into the main bit.

653
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:09,761
Speaker 0: Let's just dive right in because, uh, climate change plays real obviously, but, uh, what's

654
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:16,301
Speaker 1: happening is the biggest one, but there are other things causing an increase of natural disasters of

655
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:16,983
Speaker 0: all kinds

656
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:19,710
Speaker 1: around the entire globe, but this has

657
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,933
Speaker 0: accelerated significantly like to a degree that it is notable and this needs to be talked about more.

658
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:37,564
Speaker 1: And even if, even if, even if, even if environmentalists take over the whole world, right tomorrow, there is to some extent, nothing we can do.

659
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,590
Speaker 1: It's going to continue for a while.

660
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,032
Speaker 0: Yup.

661
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:44,150
Speaker 0: The conversation, uh, and again, the snowball is already rolling down the hill.

662
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,439
Speaker 1: Our goal is now to slow the snowball, right?

663
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:57,491
Speaker 0: Our goal is to prevent the worst future while simultaneously not preventing current harms and near future harms so much as mitigating those harms.

664
00:44:58,413 --> 00:45:02,644
Speaker 0: Mitigation is the best we can do for the decades to come.

665
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,775
Speaker 1: A lot of people use inevitability like, Oh, yup.

666
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:08,470
Speaker 1: There's nothing we can do about that at this point as an excuse to give up.

667
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:09,152
Speaker 1: Nope.

668
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:09,474
Speaker 1: Nope.

669
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:09,694
Speaker 0: Nope.

670
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,003
Speaker 0: Cause if we do nothing, this gets bad.

671
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:12,686
Speaker 0: Even worse.

672
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:13,750
Speaker 0: Like here's the difference.

673
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:19,999
Speaker 0: Say, uh, you know, there's that YouTube video where the guy burns down his entire house in a live state as a water in the ceiling.

674
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,969
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, I can't afford to fix the roof.

675
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,316
Speaker 1: Might as well just let it leak.

676
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,630
Speaker 1: And then the roof collapses on you and you're, you're crushed.

677
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,182
Speaker 1: It's like, well, you could have at least put a bucket under it, right?

678
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:31,216
Speaker 1: Or like put a piece of plastic on the roof or something.

679
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:31,819
Speaker 1: Yup.

680
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:37,521
Speaker 0: So, uh, what we're going to talk about today is not that so much as the natural disasters themselves.

681
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:40,372
Speaker 0: And I guess what we're defining is the natural disaster.

682
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:43,100
Speaker 0: climate and weather disasters count.

683
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:56,746
Speaker 0: I, even though they are ostensibly, especially currently pretty much directly caused by humans, but that is different from like an industrial disaster or a dam like collapsing where often they are combined.

684
00:45:56,806 --> 00:45:57,890
Speaker 1: often they're combined, right?

685
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:04,255
Speaker 1: One can cause the other, uh, you know, like an earthquake messing up your nuclear power plant, Japan or something like that.

686
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:14,368
Speaker 0: But, uh, we're going to focus on like a natural disaster where there was not a discrete human cause in a direct immediate causal chain.

687
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:14,669
Speaker 0: Right.

688
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:23,209
Speaker 1: Well, the first natural disaster that I, at least the one I have the most experience with personally in my life is the hurricane, which if you live in the other side of the world is a cyclone.

689
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,107
Speaker 1: It's just a huge ass fucking storm that spins its way over everything with crazy winds and rain.

690
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:31,059
Speaker 0: Um, I grew up in hurricane Alec.

691
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,841
Speaker 0: I grew up in a, in a tornado place where tornadoes that caused serious damage happen often.

692
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:37,404
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:38,709
Speaker 1: But you didn't experience hurricanes.

694
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,212
Speaker 1: I don't know.

695
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:40,135
Speaker 0: Didn't experience hurricanes.

696
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:41,903
Speaker 0: I am in my own life.

697
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:44,354
Speaker 1: I am Sandy was the only hurricane you experienced.

698
00:46:44,656 --> 00:46:45,038
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

699
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,813
Speaker 0: Cause the other hurricanes that hit New York, we were actually out of town during them.

700
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:48,595
Speaker 1: Okay.

701
00:46:48,615 --> 00:46:52,929
Speaker 1: So I experienced hurricane Andrew and some other ones.

702
00:46:52,969 --> 00:47:01,646
Speaker 1: I forget the name of basically in the nineties, you know, late eighties, early nineties, Connecticut, there were hurricanes that, you know, hit us in Connecticut.

703
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:05,119
Speaker 1: And I remember the, the most damage I remember is most like trees coming down.

704
00:47:05,139 --> 00:47:10,637
Speaker 1: Uh, there was a, we had like a little shed that we would like put a lawnmower in.

705
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:12,683
Speaker 1: It just got like blown away.

706
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:16,919
Speaker 1: Um, I remember what during one hurricane might've been Andrew.

707
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,516
Speaker 1: I think, uh, the neighbors across the street, obviously couldn't go to the store.

708
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:22,926
Speaker 1: Uh, I put on a raincoat and I brought them.

709
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:24,211
Speaker 1: I forget it was eggs or sugar.

710
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:24,853
Speaker 1: I had to care.

711
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:25,375
Speaker 1: Right.

712
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:30,469
Speaker 1: Um, and it was basically like the wind was like pushing me.

713
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:33,661
Speaker 1: I couldn't, it was hard to walk across the street cause of being pushed by wind.

714
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:37,334
Speaker 1: Uh, and also there was so much rain.

715
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:43,054
Speaker 1: It was like basically someone was hitting you, like shooting a fire hose and aiming at you on purpose.

716
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:50,367
Speaker 1: Um, but it's interesting that wasn't even, and it wasn't even like at the level of, I could, I could see, I was able to successfully walk across the street.

717
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:56,752
Speaker 1: It was not the level of like, you know, an even stronger hurricane would like just knock, you know, trees over.

718
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:57,174
Speaker 1: Right.

719
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:00,405
Speaker 1: Trees weren't coming down then, but it was still that bad.

720
00:48:00,606 --> 00:48:05,589
Speaker 0: It's interesting that, you know, you're living in Connecticut and then New York, me living in Michigan and then New York.

721
00:48:06,331 --> 00:48:14,317
Speaker 0: We just happened to have, for a lot of reasons, lived in places that have relatively few and relatively rare natural disasters.

722
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:25,596
Speaker 1: Well, I was born in these places, but then choosing, I, once I was able to choose where I lived, uh, I intentionally chose to live in places with few natural disasters.

723
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:29,369
Speaker 1: It wasn't the only factor, but it was a significant factor.

724
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:39,664
Speaker 1: I, you know, if, if there weren't earthquakes and mudslides and fires in California, I may have been willing to go work over there.

725
00:48:39,704 --> 00:48:42,634
Speaker 1: in Silicon Valley, you know, before I hated the culture there.

726
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:44,903
Speaker 0: And before I realized there's no mass transit over there.

727
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,148
Speaker 0: Yeah.

728
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:50,572
Speaker 1: I wasn't thinking about, but that, I wasn't thinking about the culture or the mass transit in the early two- Me either.

729
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:53,885
Speaker 0: When I was young, like LA and New York were two big cities.

730
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:57,541
Speaker 0: And now that I'm older, I realized that one is a hellscape and one is amazing.

731
00:48:58,124 --> 00:48:58,285
Speaker 1: Right.

732
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:08,861
Speaker 1: So when I, when I graduated college at that time, the natural disasters were like probably on the pro-con scale, like enough to tip the scale away from California.

733
00:49:08,881 --> 00:49:12,756
Speaker 1: Nowadays, they're just one of many things tipping the scale away from California.

734
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:17,194
Speaker 0: You know, my family has been in the United, like on this continent for a very long time.

735
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,140
Speaker 0: Like some of them were pre-revolution.

736
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:27,868
Speaker 0: And the fam, the entire family converged from a lot, moving around all over to eventually be in the Midwest.

737
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:35,296
Speaker 0: Partly because, like we know some family history, that region has very few natural disasters and is extremely stable and safe.

738
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:36,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

739
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,769
Speaker 1: I don't know why so many people keep going to Florida.

740
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:48,378
Speaker 0: Like Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Ontario, like that area is honestly one of the safest places in the entire earth from natural disasters.

741
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:50,925
Speaker 0: Like literally no joke, no exaggeration.

742
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,421
Speaker 0: It'll be interesting as climate change accelerates natural disasters.

743
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:56,084
Speaker 0: What happens?

744
00:49:56,486 --> 00:50:05,091
Speaker 0: because Detroit and Chicago and Buffalo and Toronto end up being the biggest cities that are in the safest zone on earth.

745
00:50:06,014 --> 00:50:10,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're on the great lakes, but the great lakes are very safe.

746
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:15,266
Speaker 0: The great lakes, not only are they very safe, but they are a supply of fresh water.

747
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:17,857
Speaker 0: They're one of the largest, fresh water on earth.

748
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:18,660
Speaker 1: Yup.

749
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:23,321
Speaker 1: And the, the, the question though is, you know, obviously, you know, the melting ice caps, right?

750
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:24,306
Speaker 1: But that's in the ocean.

751
00:50:24,346 --> 00:50:25,552
Speaker 1: That's not in the lake, right?

752
00:50:25,813 --> 00:50:29,668
Speaker 1: But that water, you know, can make it to the lake eventually, right?

753
00:50:29,688 --> 00:50:38,826
Speaker 0: If water, water will evolve with the great while the great lakes due to like the lock systems, like not to go too deep into the hydrology of it, they can be drained at a whim.

754
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:43,181
Speaker 0: If they were, if they were rising to somewhere, you just drain it to the ocean.

755
00:50:44,384 --> 00:50:44,665
Speaker 1: Sure.

756
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:45,086
Speaker 1: There's a way.

757
00:50:45,107 --> 00:50:48,037
Speaker 0: No, there's canals and blocks and shit.

758
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:52,253
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's like, you know, it's not a hundred percent perfect, right?

759
00:50:52,273 --> 00:50:56,772
Speaker 1: There could be depending on, you know, the rate of water level rising, right?

760
00:50:56,852 --> 00:50:59,726
Speaker 1: On the coast there, it definitely won't be as bad as on the coast.

761
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:03,806
Speaker 0: Historically, the lakes were shrinking because of climate change, but now weather patterns.

762
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:07,104
Speaker 1: that also gives you, that also gives you some time to, you know, some space there.

763
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:08,432
Speaker 0: No, but a weather pattern shifted.

764
00:51:08,472 --> 00:51:16,250
Speaker 0: And honestly, because it would be easy to drain them compared to fill them, the fact that they're, oh no, I'm just saying the fact that I'm agreeing, it's pretty safe.

765
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,320
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there's climate change continues.

766
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:28,126
Speaker 1: that safety barrier, which will keep them safer than ocean coast places for quite a while will eventually also fall.

767
00:51:28,707 --> 00:51:28,948
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

768
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:37,698
Speaker 1: But I'm saying for the foreseeable, like even like many, they have a much longer safe headway before it's just a flood than New York does.

769
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:41,997
Speaker 0: Like that, if things get bad and the coast collapse, honestly, I go back to Michigan.

770
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:48,048
Speaker 0: Like that's, again, I have the privilege of being able to just travel and escape things, but I mean, I can just, well, you gotta, you gotta get out here somehow.

771
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:48,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

772
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,319
Speaker 1: But in terms of- Everyone's gonna go somewhere.

773
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,959
Speaker 1: But also- Nothing stops me, I don't have family in Michigan, but it doesn't stop me from going to Michigan.

774
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:54,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

775
00:51:54,602 --> 00:51:56,452
Speaker 1: But in terms of- Not that I want to go there.

776
00:51:56,573 --> 00:52:03,830
Speaker 0: But in terms of like that aspect, like dealing with natural disasters, one thing that, and this is, this is like coming from a position of extreme luck and privilege.

777
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:18,710
Speaker 0: Every natural disaster I've ever experienced in my, for my personal interactions in day-to-day life, they were positive or enjoyable because they didn't actually affect me materially.

778
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:20,132
Speaker 1: Yeah.

779
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:22,842
Speaker 1: That is an interesting thing to experience.

780
00:52:22,862 --> 00:52:32,694
Speaker 0: Like hurricane Sandy, to be really honest, knowing what like the horrors that were happening in my own day-to-day life, it was just a really nice break from work.

781
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,782
Speaker 0: Uh, it was interesting weather.

782
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:38,095
Speaker 0: I went biking around in a city that was completely shut down.

783
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:43,014
Speaker 0: Like everything I did on a day-to-day basis was just novel, interesting, and fun.

784
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:48,194
Speaker 0: So it's weird to think back and like, oh yeah, I could almost be nostalgic for hurricane Sandy.

785
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:53,853
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about, you know, the, the, the most awesome of natural disasters, right?

786
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:55,279
Speaker 1: The volcano eruption, right?

787
00:52:55,842 --> 00:53:09,369
Speaker 1: And the volcano eruption is like the perfect illustration of the duality in that if you live at the bottom of the volcano and your whole, you know, society is now burned away, that's the worst thing ever, right?

788
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:13,503
Speaker 1: It's like, nothing worse can happen than volcano on your house, right?

789
00:53:13,564 --> 00:53:18,400
Speaker 1: I did know what natural disasters worse than that asteroid hitting your house.

790
00:53:19,383 --> 00:53:24,160
Speaker 1: No, cause you would, that would be a faster and swifter death than the volcano, right?

791
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:25,424
Speaker 1: Volcano is terrifying.

792
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:28,819
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the pyroclastic, whatever would kill you pretty much instantly.

793
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:31,854
Speaker 1: Like I would rather have a tornado hit my house than a volcano hit my house.

794
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:32,616
Speaker 1: Yeah.

795
00:53:34,121 --> 00:53:34,322
Speaker 1: Right.

796
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:35,245
Speaker 0: No tornado.

797
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:39,101
Speaker 0: You'd probably survive in the rubble and then die days later of, of a thirst.

798
00:53:39,262 --> 00:53:39,864
Speaker 1: It depends.

799
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:40,467
Speaker 1: It depends.

800
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:41,694
Speaker 1: But at least I'm hiding in the basement.

801
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:43,869
Speaker 1: Whenever the volcano comes, you'll hide in the basement from volcano.

802
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:52,074
Speaker 1: So, but if you are just far away from the volcano watching it, it's just, you know, it pollutes the sky.

803
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:54,923
Speaker 1: Um, but it's like, it's just kind of awesome.

804
00:53:55,505 --> 00:54:00,848
Speaker 1: And you know, when it's, people will go up to erupting volcanoes and like check out the lava geologists and shit.

805
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:02,636
Speaker 1: And it's like, you watch it in videos.

806
00:54:02,677 --> 00:54:04,224
Speaker 1: It's like totally cool, right?

807
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:05,630
Speaker 1: It's like this awesome neat thing.

808
00:54:06,111 --> 00:54:08,703
Speaker 1: As long as it's not hitting a person.

809
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:16,129
Speaker 0: Like when I was a kid, when I was in middle school, there was a blizzard, like a, like a dangerous, like super huge blizzard in Michigan.

810
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:21,169
Speaker 1: Like it I don't know if blizzard really comes into the, I guess maybe because it's where I live.

811
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:22,675
Speaker 1: There's so many nor'easters and blizzards.

812
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:26,128
Speaker 1: It doesn't feel like it's natural disaster.

813
00:54:26,148 --> 00:54:28,361
Speaker 0: That's actually because the listener was talking about this in the chat too.

814
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:29,549
Speaker 1: It's a weather, a weather event.

815
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:48,577
Speaker 0: People who live in the Midwest and the East coast, like at like New York and Boston and places like that, blizzards, we barely treat as natural disasters because there is so much infrastructure, knowledge, expertise, skill, and just being used to shit about blizzards that if six feet of snow come down, we just fucking deal with it.

816
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:52,472
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, go even a little bit south to like Georgia.

817
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:58,869
Speaker 0: And if there is a quarter inch of snow, hundreds die and things are shut down for weeks.

818
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:08,316
Speaker 0: But when I was a kid in Michigan in the middle school, there was a blizzard so bad that parts like Southeast Michigan shut down.

819
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:09,460
Speaker 0: Like that is a big deal.

820
00:55:09,861 --> 00:55:13,395
Speaker 0: We had seven-ish feet of snow on our house.

821
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:15,322
Speaker 0: Like we had, we could not get out.

822
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:18,053
Speaker 0: We had to get out the second window and then dig out the front door.

823
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:20,342
Speaker 0: And you know what my kid memory is?

824
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:21,887
Speaker 0: No school for two weeks.

825
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:22,329
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

826
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:26,105
Speaker 0: Coupled with I'm going to go out and explore all day.

827
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:27,170
Speaker 0: This is going to be awesome.

828
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:32,970
Speaker 0: And then I'm going to sled from the roof to the street.

829
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:34,391
Speaker 1: Yeah.

830
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:36,781
Speaker 0: Actually my parents did not let me do that.

831
00:55:37,102 --> 00:55:39,834
Speaker 0: To this day, I'm disappointed that they would not let me do that.

832
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:42,188
Speaker 1: Did you at least jump out the window into the seven feet of snow?

833
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:42,430
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

834
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:43,493
Speaker 0: Even better.

835
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:46,467
Speaker 0: I went out hiking through this, through the woods and everything.

836
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:47,191
Speaker 0: It was such a good time.

837
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,398
Speaker 1: Well, how could you even see the woods?

838
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:49,364
Speaker 1: Wouldn't it just be snow?

839
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:51,053
Speaker 0: Woods are way taller than seven feet.

840
00:55:51,073 --> 00:55:51,736
Speaker 1: You had to dig.

841
00:55:51,897 --> 00:55:53,464
Speaker 1: You had to dig to walk, right?

842
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:55,834
Speaker 0: I just, when I got put on snowshoes and went out.

843
00:55:56,578 --> 00:55:56,939
Speaker 1: Oh, you what?

844
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,064
Speaker 1: You stood on top of it all.

845
00:55:58,124 --> 00:55:58,406
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

846
00:55:58,426 --> 00:56:00,817
Speaker 1: Cause again, Sierra seven feet in the air.

847
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:01,862
Speaker 0: I'm an outdoor type person.

848
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:03,128
Speaker 0: My family's been outdoors.

849
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:05,960
Speaker 1: You weren't, you weren't at ground level digging seven feet.

850
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,266
Speaker 1: You were seven feet up walking.

851
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:08,290
Speaker 0: I'm a Michigander.

852
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:11,226
Speaker 0: If there's snow, I have snowshoes that I'm walking on top of it.

853
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:11,990
Speaker 0: Cause I'm not stupid.

854
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,561
Speaker 1: We didn't have snowshoe, but okay.

855
00:56:14,742 --> 00:56:15,767
Speaker 1: But that makes a lot more sense.

856
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:17,896
Speaker 1: I thought you were like, I thought you're digging a tunnel.

857
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:30,344
Speaker 0: That was a dangerous situation because that is a place where people do not prepare for a blizzard shutting things down because even once every century level blizzards can be mitigated very quickly.

858
00:56:30,384 --> 00:56:33,215
Speaker 0: And this blizzard was bad enough where we could not mitigate it quickly.

859
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:35,362
Speaker 0: So no one was prepared for it.

860
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:40,138
Speaker 0: But even at that time in my life, it was just a really pleasant week.

861
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:43,273
Speaker 0: I didn't have to deal with any of the problems of the natural disaster.

862
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:44,057
Speaker 0: I just enjoyed it.

863
00:56:44,078 --> 00:56:44,982
Speaker 0: Right.

864
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:47,254
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about, you know, I mentioned earthquake, right?

865
00:56:47,294 --> 00:56:50,027
Speaker 1: In California, the buildings are designed around earthquake.

866
00:56:50,148 --> 00:56:52,137
Speaker 1: They have all sorts of earthquake protections on them.

867
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,216
Speaker 1: So it's like, if an earthquake happens there, it's like, it's still going to damage.

868
00:56:56,638 --> 00:56:57,201
Speaker 1: It's not great.

869
00:56:57,402 --> 00:56:57,643
Speaker 1: Right.

870
00:56:57,824 --> 00:57:02,298
Speaker 1: You know, there's a certain level of, at least if it's above a certain severity level.

871
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:02,700
Speaker 1: Right.

872
00:57:04,285 --> 00:57:06,271
Speaker 1: But you know, the buildings aren't going to like.

873
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:12,077
Speaker 1: the big skyscrapers are very unlikely to just like fall down and cause, you know, Godzilla level destruction.

874
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:13,725
Speaker 0: But if a real earthquake hit New York.

875
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:21,816
Speaker 1: If you had a big, if you had a big earthquake in New York city where the buildings are not designed for earthquake, we are in deep shit.

876
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:22,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

877
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:39,421
Speaker 0: Years ago, when there was that, that really, really minor earthquake that slightly shook New York, like a tiny bit, the buildings here swayed so much that people like, I was on the street and I did not feel the earthquake, but suddenly out of nowhere, people started yelling and running out of the subway.

878
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:44,041
Speaker 0: And I saw people running out of buildings and all I'm thinking is what the fuck is going on?

879
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:44,986
Speaker 0: What the fuck is going on?

880
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:55,450
Speaker 0: Because I had no context for that because the buildings are so not earthquake ready and so old that if you're like on the 16th or 20th floor of one of these like hundred year old New York buildings,

881
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:58,139
Speaker 1: and you'll feel it, it amplifies

882
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,810
Speaker 0: enough to where people started running and yelling.

883
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:02,132
Speaker 1: Yup.

884
00:58:03,536 --> 00:58:04,119
Speaker 1: So that's the thing.

885
00:58:04,259 --> 00:58:04,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

886
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,022
Speaker 1: Let's see.

887
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:10,477
Speaker 1: So we covered, we covered about volcano, hurricane, tornado, earthquake.

888
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:22,532
Speaker 1: I guess there's sort of the, the, the thing that goes with earthquake, which is tsunami, which goes with, which goes with flood, flood really accompanies like almost everything.

889
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:31,367
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, so many disasters are water related and like, you know, even something, even if you're far away from the ocean, like tornado can cause flood.

890
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:35,442
Speaker 1: If it breaks a water main or a dam breaks or, you know, it's like.

891
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:37,570
Speaker 1: floods are just like the, the, like everything.

892
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,157
Speaker 1: they're all, all over the place.

893
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:42,531
Speaker 1: Flood is actually even in the, even in the desert, you get flash flood.

894
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:51,864
Speaker 0: Flood is actually one of the few natural disasters I actually have a like kind of specific plan, like continuously plan around in my actual life.

895
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:55,317
Speaker 1: No matter where you are, you got to worry about flood situations.

896
00:58:55,418 --> 00:59:00,903
Speaker 0: Even if you live in the desert, like flash floods are actually way more dangerous in dry places than they are in wet places.

897
00:59:00,923 --> 00:59:02,492
Speaker 1: And I think they're getting more common as well.

898
00:59:02,512 --> 00:59:03,014
Speaker 0: They are.

899
00:59:03,396 --> 00:59:06,410
Speaker 1: I'm noticing that the flooding in New York city has definitely gotten worse.

900
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:09,238
Speaker 0: We talked about this in real life.

901
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,726
Speaker 0: We didn't talk about it on the show.

902
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,755
Speaker 0: So there's a thing that happened during COVID.

903
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:20,762
Speaker 0: New York city has this thing that's not common in a lot of places called alternate side parking, but it is in, it is a thing in other places.

904
00:59:21,063 --> 00:59:29,594
Speaker 0: Meaning on a few, a few days a week where if you're parked on certain streets, you got to move your car to the other side of the street.

905
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:31,623
Speaker 0: And then the next day you got to move it back.

906
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:33,532
Speaker 0: Like you can't leave your car somewhere.

907
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:34,135
Speaker 1: Right.

908
00:59:34,175 --> 00:59:39,601
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like between these hours, right from eight in the morning to one, you can't park on the left side of the street today.

909
00:59:39,862 --> 00:59:43,438
Speaker 1: And then tomorrow same hours, but you can't park on the right side of the street.

910
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:51,737
Speaker 0: Now, naive people and car people have made an argument for a long time that these rules are archaic and they're just to discourage street parking, which is not true.

911
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:52,501
Speaker 0: Those rules.

912
00:59:52,562 --> 00:59:55,174
Speaker 1: If we wanted to discourage street parking, we would just charge for it everywhere.

913
00:59:55,315 --> 01:00:04,957
Speaker 0: Those rules actually came from the New York city's like ancient, like it was a different organization at the time, but basically the department of sanitation and human welfare type stuff.

914
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:05,258
Speaker 0: Right.

915
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:07,992
Speaker 0: Because the only reason they do it is so they can sweep the streets.

916
01:00:08,374 --> 01:00:11,350
Speaker 0: And the reason they sweep the streets is so the streets aren't filled with garbage.

917
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:12,493
Speaker 1: Right.

918
01:00:12,513 --> 01:00:14,926
Speaker 1: So it's like, you might think, Oh, well just cleanliness, right?

919
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:16,293
Speaker 1: We just want to keep the city clean.

920
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:20,472
Speaker 1: We need you to move your car so we can clean the curb and all the filth that's piled up in the curb.

921
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:21,094
Speaker 1: That's true.

922
01:00:21,114 --> 01:00:27,416
Speaker 1: It is for that reason, but it's also because when filth piles up on the street, it blocks all the drains.

923
01:00:27,496 --> 01:00:27,737
Speaker 1: Yup.

924
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:36,210
Speaker 0: So during COVID that causes floods, the city decided to alternate street parking from twice a week to once a week and car people were really happy.

925
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:40,325
Speaker 0: So they decided to keep it that way permanently because car people were happy.

926
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:44,400
Speaker 0: And it turns out that is why we had so much flash flooding in New York now.

927
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:49,802
Speaker 1: That's true, but there was even before COVID the, the, the flooding has been getting worse.

928
01:00:49,882 --> 01:00:50,947
Speaker 0: It was getting worse.

929
01:00:51,128 --> 01:00:55,248
Speaker 0: And then it went beyond the tipping point way earlier because we're not sweeping the streets twice a week.

930
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:55,831
Speaker 1: We pushed it.

931
01:00:55,851 --> 01:01:02,797
Speaker 1: We pushed it a little harder by not sweeping enough, but the point is we're getting rained on harder, more rain, right?

932
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,003
Speaker 1: The river, the sea is rising on us.

933
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:08,374
Speaker 1: You know, and flooding is going to be a thing here.

934
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:10,905
Speaker 1: If you live near the water, New York city is an island.

935
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:12,311
Speaker 1: Manhattan's an island, at least

936
01:01:12,592 --> 01:01:36,047
Speaker 0: like, you know, you've got to like, my advice to you is you have to internalize the fact that for the rest of your life, even if we do everything right and things get better and we like correct this course as a species, which I'm, I'm hopeful we will, nothing is going to prevent the next decade of your life from being weird and there being more natural disasters, like more enough to where you have to start preparing for things that you have never had to worry about before.

937
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:37,431
Speaker 1: Right.

938
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:39,303
Speaker 1: Cause you think, Oh, up on a mountain, I won't get flood.

939
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:39,545
Speaker 1: Yeah.

940
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,595
Speaker 1: Up on the mountain where you'll get mudslide instead.

941
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:42,117
Speaker 0: Right.

942
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,928
Speaker 1: It's like, Oh, well I'm, uh, I'm out here.

943
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:48,509
Speaker 1: And you know, it's like, well, you know, in the, in the woods, there'll be a fire in the woods.

944
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:51,100
Speaker 1: Like, look at again, the West coast or everything's on fire.

945
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:57,423
Speaker 0: Uh, at this point, I believe that is the second largest wildfire in the recorded history of North America.

946
01:01:57,985 --> 01:01:59,751
Speaker 1: But Greece and Turkey are on fire.

947
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:02,663
Speaker 1: You don't think about those as places with crazy forests.

948
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:03,566
Speaker 1: It's super bad.

949
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:06,798
Speaker 0: Like Turkey is, the nation of Turkey is on fire.

950
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:10,092
Speaker 0: It's barely even making the news because of all the other disasters happening.

951
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:10,835
Speaker 0: Good.

952
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:12,783
Speaker 0: Look at what's happening in Turkey right now.

953
01:02:12,883 --> 01:02:14,128
Speaker 0: It is terrifying.

954
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:15,895
Speaker 0: And I saw that the best tweet.

955
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:17,019
Speaker 1: Greece is the same thing.

956
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:33,334
Speaker 0: The tweet that encapsulated this so well was like, it basically said, I'm paraphrasing climate change means that you'll be watching natural disasters on your phone with increasing, increasing frequency until eventually you're going to be the one recording it on your phone.

957
01:02:34,779 --> 01:02:35,803
Speaker 0: And that's how it's going to go.

958
01:02:36,205 --> 01:02:38,593
Speaker 0: No amount of money and privilege will protect you from this.

959
01:02:38,614 --> 01:02:39,637
Speaker 1: Yeah.

960
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:45,779
Speaker 1: There's, I mean, it's like, you know, no, even if you're like, I can't imagine you're Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos, right?

961
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,933
Speaker 1: It's like, and that there's nowhere you can run or hide from natural disaster.

962
01:02:51,953 --> 01:02:52,936
Speaker 0: What can you possibly do?

963
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,365
Speaker 1: You live on a boat.

964
01:02:56,465 --> 01:02:57,310
Speaker 1: That's not going to do it.

965
01:02:57,351 --> 01:02:58,820
Speaker 1: Hurricane will come and knock your boat over.

966
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,691
Speaker 0: Now the two, because we've gone on long enough for the show, every show goes long because we don't talk to each other that much in real life right now.

967
01:03:04,812 --> 01:03:06,641
Speaker 0: So this is when we like get everything out.

968
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:07,243
Speaker 0: that's pent up.

969
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,046
Speaker 1: We'll fix that.

970
01:03:08,066 --> 01:03:08,930
Speaker 1: We'll fix that next week.

971
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:17,106
Speaker 0: But next week I feel like a dam is just going to like burst out of my brain of me saying weird shit that I've been bottling up for two years or a year and a half.

972
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:24,488
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I guess the two big takeaways to end this is one, don't like catastrophize and doom and gloom.

973
01:03:24,529 --> 01:03:27,819
Speaker 0: Like don't go overboard planning and preparing.

974
01:03:27,979 --> 01:03:29,024
Speaker 0: Like there's a line.

975
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,610
Speaker 1: Do not be, do not be a prepper.

976
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:35,245
Speaker 1: So for example, New York city actually has, what's it called?

977
01:03:35,446 --> 01:03:36,452
Speaker 0: Well, we have the evacuation.

978
01:03:36,472 --> 01:03:38,242
Speaker 1: There's like a whole, no, there's a whole department.

979
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:38,704
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

980
01:03:39,346 --> 01:03:43,442
Speaker 0: Well, New York city actually is very well prepared to deal with natural disasters.

981
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:48,363
Speaker 0: Like there are, there are contingency plans that can be triggered that are surprisingly well thought out.

982
01:03:48,403 --> 01:03:51,413
Speaker 0: Like there are ways to evacuate New York city.

983
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:56,210
Speaker 0: Think about that for a second, what the scale of that kind of thing would mean.

984
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,924
Speaker 1: That is the New York city, like department of emergency management.

985
01:03:59,964 --> 01:04:05,042
Speaker 1: It's like a whole thing specifically for emergency management in New York city, a whole department.

986
01:04:05,464 --> 01:04:07,930
Speaker 1: And you can go and they have websites and they have all these tools.

987
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:17,384
Speaker 1: Like can follow them and get informed and they'll, you know, they help you out with like basically everything, right?

988
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:21,959
Speaker 1: So, um, and it's, and it's not, you know, prepper level in the woods stuff.

989
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:23,605
Speaker 1: It's common sense stuff, right?

990
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:35,228
Speaker 1: Everything from like check your fricking smoke detector to if you, you know, what flood zone is your house in and where will you evacuate to and how will you know if it's time to evacuate and you know, whatnot.

991
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:42,078
Speaker 1: So whenever, wherever you live, I don't know how your government or whatever handles those things, but there's going to be something.

992
01:04:42,098 --> 01:04:48,480
Speaker 1: If you have this enough technology to hear a podcast, you have some sort of emergency management, something.

993
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:56,807
Speaker 0: Go learn what the deal is so that if anything goes wrong and like there's a disaster, you know what to expect and how much help could arrive when.

994
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:57,949
Speaker 0: Right.

995
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:02,120
Speaker 1: And learn the reasonable level of stuff.

996
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:03,767
Speaker 1: that what you need to know, right?

997
01:05:03,787 --> 01:05:05,877
Speaker 1: Be, you know, don't go overboard, right?

998
01:05:06,058 --> 01:05:08,669
Speaker 0: Like I'll give you an territory.

999
01:05:08,689 --> 01:05:09,271
Speaker 1: You don't need that.

1000
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,316
Speaker 0: You want to know what my prep is?

1001
01:05:10,336 --> 01:05:11,901
Speaker 0: Cause I can explain it very succinctly.

1002
01:05:12,724 --> 01:05:18,820
Speaker 0: I have plans like real plans to survive, escape and deal with natural disasters.

1003
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:21,565
Speaker 0: only as far as could.

1004
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:32,440
Speaker 0: I get far enough away from New York city within about a day to where it's not a problem anymore and anything where that would not save me, I do not worry about.

1005
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:33,943
Speaker 1: Hmm.

1006
01:05:34,023 --> 01:05:34,143
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1007
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:38,542
Speaker 1: It's like if there's a nuke, which is not a natural disaster and it's a natural disaster.

1008
01:05:38,985 --> 01:05:41,798
Speaker 1: Um, but it's like, well, there's nothing I can really do about that.

1009
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:43,284
Speaker 0: Well, depends on what kind of.

1010
01:05:43,385 --> 01:05:48,066
Speaker 0: actually, if it's a, if it's a non-thermonuclear nuke, they're, they're very specific.

1011
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,051
Speaker 1: You get the idea.

1012
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:53,733
Speaker 1: If I'm in like the incineration zone, it's like, I just call people and say, you know, I love you.

1013
01:05:53,793 --> 01:05:55,320
Speaker 1: I'm going to die until the phone stops.

1014
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:08,891
Speaker 0: But, uh, but, but I guess what I've, what I've changed about those plans in the last year, specifically because of the acceleration of climate change related natural disasters, is I've added something to that plan that I never worried about before.

1015
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:18,423
Speaker 0: Being able to act, to get fresh water that is safe to drink for myself within a hundred miles of New York city if the water supply stops.

1016
01:06:19,626 --> 01:06:23,437
Speaker 1: Oh, I just have, I just have water like, you know, in bottles.

1017
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:28,298
Speaker 0: So you want, actually I have, I have some extra life straws now if you want one to keep as a backup.

1018
01:06:28,399 --> 01:06:30,626
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think that's going to be necessary, right?

1019
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:43,092
Speaker 1: The water, the amount of water that I have in my fridge at any given time, if that's not enough water to get probably me and a few other people away from the disaster, right?

1020
01:06:43,193 --> 01:06:44,519
Speaker 1: It's like, well, we're not going to get away.

1021
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,176
Speaker 0: Well, what I would say is you need, this is, this is my personal assessment.

1022
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:52,012
Speaker 0: If you're less athletic, you need more probably, or you need to go read some other expert things.

1023
01:06:52,053 --> 01:07:07,880
Speaker 0: But my rule for myself and Emily, like together, because we hike a lot, is I would have at minimum one liter of water per person per, I don't know, 10 miles of difficult travel that would be necessary to escape.

1024
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,359
Speaker 1: I guess that depends if I can, if the disaster has prevented bicycling.

1025
01:07:12,379 --> 01:07:13,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, because here's the thing.

1026
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:23,238
Speaker 0: In a disaster, you need to understand that cars don't work anymore and bikes that are not mountain bikes often might not work anymore either.

1027
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:38,263
Speaker 0: It depends on the disaster, but even traveling by foot, one, most people cannot travel more than 10 miles on foot in America without suffering effectively a casualty incident, meaning they cannot walk further after that.

1028
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:40,432
Speaker 0: For reasons, it's too much to get into.

1029
01:07:40,493 --> 01:07:45,195
Speaker 0: That's an old New Yorkers, New Yorkers can walk for the Yorkers can, but the average American cannot.

1030
01:07:45,236 --> 01:07:46,100
Speaker 0: This was something terrifying.

1031
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:50,640
Speaker 0: I learned from America's, this is all declassified military stuff in the fifties.

1032
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:59,094
Speaker 0: The US government had a thing where they were looking at what would happen if a city got nuked and they were looking at old baby nukes, not modern thermo nukes.

1033
01:07:59,516 --> 01:08:08,752
Speaker 0: And they identified that the primary source of casualties would be that the average American could not walk five miles without suffering an event that incapacitated them.

1034
01:08:09,053 --> 01:08:10,658
Speaker 0: And the event was blisters.

1035
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:16,929
Speaker 1: Even without the nuke, if you just got someone out of their house and be like, Hey, walk five miles, five mile, let's walk five miles right now.

1036
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,657
Speaker 1: Let's go walk five miles nonstop.

1037
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:19,180
Speaker 0: They couldn't do it.

1038
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:19,340
Speaker 0: Yep.

1039
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:24,243
Speaker 0: It is because blisters caused by the fact that most Americans do not walk that much in their daily lives.

1040
01:08:24,545 --> 01:08:26,835
Speaker 0: Like it's, it's just a really terrifying calculus.

1041
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:39,640
Speaker 0: So the military and the US government made plans around the fact that a huge number of casualties, like unsavable, incapacitated, immobile people would occur even if they just asked everyone to walk 10 miles away from a place.

1042
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:43,229
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

1043
01:08:43,511 --> 01:08:49,609
Speaker 1: So I guess that's, that's a reasonable thing you can do, actually, if you're worried about natural disasters of any kind.

1044
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:49,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1045
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,573
Speaker 0: Walk more.

1046
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:57,037
Speaker 1: Is just, you know, make your body more fit as, you know, you don't have to become athlete fit.

1047
01:08:57,058 --> 01:08:57,982
Speaker 0: You don't have to be like me.

1048
01:08:58,002 --> 01:09:01,200
Speaker 0: You don't, don't run a half marathon every weekend or something stupid like that.

1049
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:06,674
Speaker 0: Just be able to walk over the course of an entire day, 10 miles.

1050
01:09:07,497 --> 01:09:07,636
Speaker 1: Right.

1051
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:10,245
Speaker 1: You should be able to walk 10 miles in a day.

1052
01:09:10,265 --> 01:09:11,669
Speaker 0: Like eight or nine hours of walking.

1053
01:09:12,372 --> 01:09:14,960
Speaker 1: Not unsupplied, not fast walking.

1054
01:09:16,242 --> 01:09:23,104
Speaker 1: Throughout the course of the day with resting, eating, drinking, you know, you don't have to carry a heavy load with you.

1055
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:23,886
Speaker 1: Right.

1056
01:09:23,907 --> 01:09:30,104
Speaker 1: Just within a 24 hour period, you have covered 10 miles of distance on your own two feet.

1057
01:09:30,685 --> 01:09:30,907
Speaker 1: Right.

1058
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:34,475
Speaker 1: If you can do that, then you can evacuate.

1059
01:09:34,877 --> 01:09:35,118
Speaker 1: Right.

1060
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,827
Speaker 1: Even if, you know, all this is really bad news.

1061
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:41,801
Speaker 0: And that is the kind of thing that is prudent to do now, because.

1062
01:09:41,862 --> 01:09:42,564
Speaker 1: In fair weather.

1063
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:43,669
Speaker 1: In fair weather.

1064
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:47,143
Speaker 0: One, walking enough to be able to do that will be super good for you.

1065
01:09:48,386 --> 01:09:53,745
Speaker 0: And two, that is something that you can, that is not a skill or an ability you can gain quickly.

1066
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:58,243
Speaker 0: You can't be like, well, I'm going to go buy the ability to walk 10 miles tomorrow.

1067
01:09:58,283 --> 01:09:59,650
Speaker 0: Like, no, you got to work at it a little bit.

1068
01:09:59,670 --> 01:09:59,771
Speaker 0: Right.

1069
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,420
Speaker 1: You could buy a gas mask tomorrow.

1070
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,828
Speaker 1: You could buy a water filter tomorrow.

1071
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:03,974
Speaker 1: You could buy a boat tomorrow.

1072
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,020
Speaker 1: You could buy a life vest.

1073
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,628
Speaker 0: You can't buy the ability to walk 10 miles tomorrow.

1074
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,113
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1075
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:11,520
Speaker 1: You can buy a flashlight tomorrow.

1076
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:12,985
Speaker 0: Yep.

1077
01:10:13,327 --> 01:10:16,400
Speaker 0: And if you're really paranoid, again, don't go, don't be a prepper.

1078
01:10:17,141 --> 01:10:18,827
Speaker 1: If you're really paranoid, don't be.

1079
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:19,128
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1080
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:42,595
Speaker 0: But the maximum planning I think anyone should do for this kind of thing in America, at least, is have the kind of stuff that people who go backpacking and camping have and know how to use it with a bare bare minimum of competence and be able to camp and make your way on your own for maybe a day, like a day.

1081
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:43,197
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1082
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:44,883
Speaker 1: Even that's kind of too far.

1083
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,610
Speaker 1: It's like you need water.

1084
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:49,200
Speaker 1: You need something to keep you above the water.

1085
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:55,221
Speaker 0: You know, you know how hard it is to carry enough water for a person without a camelback or an equivalent.

1086
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,628
Speaker 0: It's actually really hard for humans to do that.

1087
01:10:58,631 --> 01:11:00,597
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you have water, right?

1088
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:06,340
Speaker 1: Even if it's just like just a gallon of Poland spring in the closet, you know, whatever.

1089
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:06,941
Speaker 1: Right.

1090
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:12,641
Speaker 1: You know, you don't need like, oh, I need to, if you're not camping, don't go buy like a camping stove.

1091
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:13,444
Speaker 1: Right.

1092
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:16,755
Speaker 1: Or don't go buy like, you know, some fancy tent.

1093
01:11:16,795 --> 01:11:20,227
Speaker 0: But like a LifeStraw, they're like 10 bucks and you know what they let you do?

1094
01:11:20,588 --> 01:11:25,888
Speaker 0: Just stick this straw into any source of non-salt water out in the wild that is totally safe to drink.

1095
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,594
Speaker 1: It doesn't work on salt water?

1096
01:11:27,734 --> 01:11:40,130
Speaker 0: No, you know, you salt water, nobody who is not already an expert in survival shit should even consider any possible means of getting drinkable water from salt water.

1097
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:41,777
Speaker 1: Just that is not worth your effort.

1098
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,531
Speaker 1: Oh man, I, that reminds me, we'll just end the show on this.

1099
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,740
Speaker 1: I think this will be my thing of the day.

1100
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,379
Speaker 1: So I guess you can google it in the future if you want to watch it before it becomes my thing of the day.

1101
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:52,884
Speaker 1: This dude did a YouTube video.

1102
01:11:53,365 --> 01:12:00,502
Speaker 1: He went on a nuclear submarine and he showed two different ways.

1103
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:02,408
Speaker 1: Well, they had that, yes.

1104
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:06,922
Speaker 1: But he showed the two different ways they make oxygen and the machines that do it.

1105
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:09,710
Speaker 1: Well, machines in quotes.

1106
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:11,175
Speaker 0: I think I know.

1107
01:12:11,195 --> 01:12:15,012
Speaker 1: He also discussed the desalinization and where they get the, you know, water from and stuff.

1108
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:16,259
Speaker 0: It actually reminds me, I'll leave.

1109
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:17,768
Speaker 1: Because they need water to get oxygen.

1110
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:18,714
Speaker 0: So I'll leave you with this.

1111
01:12:18,754 --> 01:12:20,242
Speaker 0: This is like the light because it's a related thing.

1112
01:12:20,262 --> 01:12:20,704
Speaker 0: that's cool.

1113
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:26,171
Speaker 0: You know the tragedy of the HMS Terror and the HMS Erebus where everyone went crazy and died in the Arctic?

1114
01:12:26,252 --> 01:12:27,116
Speaker 0: We've talked about it before.

1115
01:12:27,137 --> 01:12:27,720
Speaker 0: We read the book.

1116
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,249
Speaker 0: So they all went crazy because of lead poisoning.

1117
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:35,923
Speaker 0: The lead poisoning was because they, the boats, were very modern.

1118
01:12:35,963 --> 01:12:53,943
Speaker 0: They had steam power so they could go through the water and they saved a shitload of space by not having to carry water because the steam could be used to, the steam system also desalinated salt water because they needed to be able to desalinate it to run the steam engine.

1119
01:12:54,285 --> 01:12:56,878
Speaker 1: So it's a lot easier to desalinate when you have a nuclear power plant.

1120
01:12:56,918 --> 01:12:57,340
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1121
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,660
Speaker 0: Because the only reason that was a bad idea was that the entire thing was made out of lead.

1122
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,121
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1123
01:13:03,181 --> 01:13:04,227
Speaker 1: Oh, we have a nuclear reactor.

1124
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:06,580
Speaker 1: Oh, well we can desalinate all the water we want, can't we?

1125
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:09,792
Speaker 1: As long as your desalination machine keeps working.

1126
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:19,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's kind of the cool thing about nuclear reactors is that once one's going, like especially one in like a naval nuclear reactor, you put fuel in one of those and they just run for 10 to 20 years.

1127
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:25,560
Speaker 1: So it's like, yeah, it's like as long as all this shit works and doesn't break, it's like, it's pretty great.

1128
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,612
Speaker 1: So you know who's really safe from natural disasters?

1129
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:29,738
Speaker 1: Nuclear submarines.

1130
01:13:29,779 --> 01:13:35,969
Speaker 0: Why do you think there's a lot of dystopian sci-fi stories where the last humans on earth are the people manning nuclear submarines hiding under the Arctic?

1131
01:13:36,994 --> 01:13:39,384
Speaker 1: Usually I think the story these days is space station people.

1132
01:13:39,445 --> 01:13:40,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen that too.

1133
01:13:41,514 --> 01:13:41,694
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1134
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:42,136
Speaker 1: All right.

1135
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:42,920
Speaker 0: I think we're good.

1136
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:43,824
Speaker 1: Oh, there should be one.

1137
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:45,029
Speaker 1: Someone should make one.

1138
01:13:45,049 --> 01:13:49,708
Speaker 1: So I actually just watched one of those Netflix's I watched was about that.

1139
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:51,273
Speaker 1: It was about like the world ends.

1140
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:56,655
Speaker 1: It seems to be nuclear war that ended the world and this one dude left up in the Arctic, right?

1141
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:59,707
Speaker 1: And he's, he's the last, everyone like evacuated the Arctic base except for him.

1142
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:02,256
Speaker 1: Um, and he tries to communicate.

1143
01:14:02,296 --> 01:14:04,103
Speaker 1: It's, it's a George Clooney thing.

1144
01:14:04,263 --> 01:14:05,267
Speaker 1: He's like, he directed it.

1145
01:14:05,428 --> 01:14:06,773
Speaker 1: He's the star of it, right?

1146
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:07,115
Speaker 1: Everything.

1147
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:15,723
Speaker 1: And he communicates with this space mission that is returning from a Jupiter moon that is suitable, that is suitable for human life.

1148
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:17,972
Speaker 1: And he's basically trying to tell them, don't come back.

1149
01:14:18,313 --> 01:14:21,465
Speaker 1: Uh, cause he's like, you're the last ones alive.

1150
01:14:22,187 --> 01:14:29,052
Speaker 1: Um, but you just made me think it's like, Hey, you could tell that same story where it's space station and nuclear sub.

1151
01:14:29,393 --> 01:14:30,598
Speaker 1: best friends are still alive.

1152
01:14:30,618 --> 01:14:33,111
Speaker 0: Pretty sure that story has been written multiple times.

1153
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:35,062
Speaker 0: If we actually look for it and they communicate with each other.

1154
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:35,525
Speaker 1: Right.

1155
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:36,774
Speaker 0: I've read one a long time ago.

1156
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:50,147
Speaker 0: I don't know what it was called, but it was basically all the, all the great power, like the U S the UK, France, like all the countries that had nuclear submarines, all the people who manned all those submarines, like the Soviet union, everyone were the only people left.

1157
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:53,702
Speaker 0: And they slowly, they're all like, yeah, why even be enemies?

1158
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:57,382
Speaker 0: If everyone else is dead, let's all just meet somewhere and figure out how to rebuild society.

1159
01:14:57,783 --> 01:14:58,184
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

1160
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:00,190
Speaker 0: It's only men because militaries are sexist.

1161
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:00,551
Speaker 0: The end.

1162
01:15:00,571 --> 01:15:03,560
Speaker 0: It was a really good story.

1163
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,745
Speaker 0: I don't remember what it was called.

1164
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:05,911
Speaker 0: It was short.

1165
01:15:06,272 --> 01:15:06,774
Speaker 0: It was not.

1166
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:08,020
Speaker 1: Are there, are there women?

1167
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:14,364
Speaker 0: I mean, we have no many, I don't believe there is any country where women are allowed to serve on nuclear submarines.

1168
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:17,416
Speaker 1: There has never been a woman serving on a nuclear submarine.

1169
01:15:17,437 --> 01:15:18,803
Speaker 0: I don't believe so.

1170
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:20,814
Speaker 1: There weren't any in the video I watched on you.

1171
01:15:20,894 --> 01:15:21,639
Speaker 1: Oh, this is my thing of the day.

1172
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:23,687
Speaker 0: I don't believe so, but I'm not sure.

1173
01:15:23,707 --> 01:15:26,276
Speaker 1: What if they made an all woman nuclear submarine?

1174
01:15:26,316 --> 01:15:32,322
Speaker 1: That would be awesome and we should, wouldn't we like win all the wars with that, that they would like, they would never lose.

1175
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,991
Speaker 1: Like, all right, I'm going to go.

1176
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:41,005
Speaker 1: You should want to know of the things on Netflix that I've watched that we could do a good show on.
