17
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:08,840

18
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:10,546

00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:22,478
Speaker 0: yep.

26
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:25,450
Speaker 1: So first off with the goods.

Speaker 0: We are going to have an Geek night's listener meetup thing kind of.

29
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:56,170
Speaker 0: it's not official It's not on the con schedule, but if you go to the Baltimore Convention Center, and you go upstairs You know there's a place with the escalators.

30
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:56,974
Speaker 0: You know the.

31
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:59,826
Speaker 0: it's not the Pratt Street Lobby It's the other one right the Otter bean.

32
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,214
Speaker 0: no I forget which Lobby the name is.

33
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:05,180
Speaker 0: if I had a BCC map I could tell you the name of the Lobby.

34
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:08,860
Speaker 0: It's the lobby with the water and the escalators the cosplay Lobby.

35
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:26,114
Speaker 0: Exactly you go up the escalators, and you turn right you go right, and you'll see this like BCC kind of directory kind of thing and there'll be a slight open area in front of some panel rooms And then there'll be some doors that go out to a patio on that patio.

36
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:29,046
Speaker 0: We're gonna hang out at 11 a.m Yes, you will.

37
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,600
Speaker 1: it will not be difficult to find us.

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,599
Speaker 1: We may or may not have some small matter of equipment set up recording or something yep.

39
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:44,239
Speaker 0: So at 11 a.m.. On Friday if you want to find us right away Especially if you should find us right away because you're gonna hang out with us a lot, then that's the place to go.

40
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:49,995
Speaker 1: Yep, the only other place we will guarantee that we will show up is the concert on Friday at 8 p.m..

41
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:55,819
Speaker 0: In the Concert arena the power plant the Rams head place at the power plant.

42
00:02:55,839 --> 00:03:03,020
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, the thing is if you want to meet us at that concert It's going to be nuts and you probably won't find us unless you found us ahead of time.

43
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,171
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's going to the way.

44
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:15,002
Speaker 0: the concerts working at Otacon this year Which is different from every place before is that there's actually a concert hall place near Otacon at the power plant Rams head whatever.

45
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:20,813
Speaker 0: it's like a normal small concert joint where bands play and They've rented it out.

46
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:26,582
Speaker 0: I guess Friday night and Saturday afternoon for the same concert But twice.

47
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:38,079
Speaker 0: so the concert is not a katah day and muck which we've talked about in the past, so We're going to go to it on Friday because on Saturday it conflicts with something else that we have to do.

48
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:49,422
Speaker 1: Yes now moving on to Saturday You can definitely without question find us at the anime club summit at 3 p.m.. In panel number 3.

49
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:59,000
Speaker 0: Yes, rim and Scott Johnson who is not me they run the anime club summit And it's an hour-long panel from 3 to 5 and I not to our long pen.

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's we think.

51
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:03,812
Speaker 1: well the panels been getting really popular so they made it bigger and they put it in a bigger room this year.

52
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:09,440
Speaker 1: hmm and We have you know we have some industry on the panel in addition to us, and it's always a good panel.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,120
Speaker 1: I mean we really do know what we're talking about when it comes to running anime clubs.

54
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, they gave you two hours.

55
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:14,979
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

56
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:23,230
Speaker 1: Yeah Usually you get one hour because a lot of the higher-ups Otacon really liked the panel and the industry really likes the panel and the Always gets a lot of people.

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,152
Speaker 0: mm-hmm see we are guaranteed to be at the anime club summit and a good place.

58
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:38,954
Speaker 0: if you just want to see us and you don't care about the Anime club summit if you go outside of panel 3 at around 5 when it the panel gets out We'll be there, and there's a decent chance at that point.

59
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,080
Speaker 1: We'll all go out and get some food.

60
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,340
Speaker 0: There is a decent chance.

61
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,745
Speaker 0: That's usually the strategy.

62
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,079
Speaker 0: now if you look at your Otacon schedule you will note that at 10 a.m.

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,967
Speaker 0: On Saturday in theater 1 which is I guess used to be main events There is a. it's called.

64
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,594
Speaker 0: There's a panel called podcasting the right stuff.

65
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,684
Speaker 0: that is not geek night That isn't.

66
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:05,991
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say what my opinions of the right stuff podcast But suffice to say that is not our panel.

67
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:09,296
Speaker 1: we may or may not be there to talk to them But don't count on it.

68
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:27,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, the right stuff international is a company that you know distributes and sells anime in the United States And they have an official company podcast and they must have unbeknownst to us until now Asked Otacon for a panel for that podcast and they have it and that has nothing to do with us.

69
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,323
Speaker 0: They're probably not even going to talk about podcasting in general I would guess.

70
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:34,074
Speaker 0: I would guess they're mostly going to talk about their podcast.

71
00:05:34,094 --> 00:05:54,414
Speaker 0: you know for the right stuff at least That's the title of their panel implies Our panel is on Sunday at 10 a.m.. In panel 4 if you come Sunday 10 a.m.. Panel room number 4 Geek nights has an hour-long panel called podcasting internet radio.

72
00:05:55,237 --> 00:06:00,552
Speaker 1: We are going to be talking about Podcasting and internet radio and geek nights.

73
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:01,214
Speaker 1: Yes.

74
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,740
Speaker 1: It'll probably be a very good panel.

75
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,071
Speaker 1: We did a similar thing at torque on.

76
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:04,877
Speaker 1: it went over very well.

77
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:16,618
Speaker 1: I expect it will be hilarious and awesome And I expect there will be much hijinks as we take everyone from the panel directly afterward to the con feedback session And then the closing ceremonies in one big blob.

78
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:16,859
Speaker 1: yeah.

79
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:26,969
Speaker 0: So if you come and see us at no other point in the convention come to our panel on Sunday at 10 a.m.. In panel room number 4.

80
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:34,638
Speaker 1: not only is that the absolute guaranteed place to find us unless we get killed or Something ahead of time, but since we'll be recording the panel most likely live.

81
00:06:35,581 --> 00:06:38,569
Speaker 1: That's your chance to appear on geek nights and ask us a question.

82
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:47,592
Speaker 0: possibly yes that episode where of the recording of that panel Will likely air not next Monday, but a week from next Monday.

83
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:50,559
Speaker 1: yep now aside from all those places you can see us.

84
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,775
Speaker 1: The things I'm excited about this year other than the usual stuff.

85
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:56,200
Speaker 1: I mean I want to go to the dances.

86
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,213
Speaker 1: I didn't get a chance to dance so much last year.

87
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:11,620
Speaker 1: mm-hmm The FMA movie is being shown and while I've heard a lot of bad things about the movie if I can watch it in the Theater at Otacon for free yeah, it looks like it starts though as soon as the Friday night concert gets out.

88
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,768
Speaker 0: That's it.

89
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:13,499
Speaker 0: we're probably not gonna.

90
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:14,826
Speaker 1: I kind of want to see.

91
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,573
Speaker 1: remember we don't have descriptions of these panels.

92
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:19,003
Speaker 1: the only things we have to go on right now are Their names.

93
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:23,000
Speaker 1: yep that said I'm interested in your favorite anime sucks.

94
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:24,716
Speaker 0: Hey, that sounds like a funny panel.

95
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,304
Speaker 1: Science and anime.

96
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:34,320
Speaker 1: only because we think it's possible that Mike Pfeffer might be running it just cuz it sounds like the kind of Well because last year he ran anime at politics in anime.

97
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:44,071
Speaker 0: So if he if it's science and anime or anime and philosophy Which is another panel that is running at the same time as the concert now of course chance He might be running it.

98
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:44,720
Speaker 1: every year.

99
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,960
Speaker 1: We go to the con feedback session and closing ceremonies because they are without exception awesome.

100
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:56,840
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the opening ceremonies you can skip but closing ceremonies and con feedback are great because one Otakon is very well run.

101
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:02,879
Speaker 1: But to the con feedback session is usually at most cons where people come and complain about the things that weren't run.

102
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,531
Speaker 1: well The way Otakon runs it is so awesome and that one.

103
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,437
Speaker 1: well I keep saying giving numbers to these things.

104
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,119
Speaker 1: I'm gonna stop that.

105
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:22,587
Speaker 1: when people have a complaint the Otakon staff always have had either a direct answer as in that happened because of X and it was out of the control out of our control because of why or That's a great idea.

106
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,759
Speaker 1: talk to us, and we'll do it your way next year.

107
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:28,351
Speaker 0: So basically no one comes up and puns them with questions.

108
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:31,080
Speaker 0: They basically put anyone who comes up with negative.

109
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:39,071
Speaker 1: I mean I remember one year some guy I think he was from cosplay.com came up And he was complaining about the way and Otakon runs their cosplay the masquerade.

110
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:48,251
Speaker 1: they don't follow cosplay.com's rules some arbitrary non-binding organization and the staffers basically said This is our con and we run it the way.

111
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:55,420
Speaker 1: the people who come to our con want it And we don't really care how other people say we should run our masquerade because everyone seems to really enjoy it.

112
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,567
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I didn't have a problem with it.

113
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,354
Speaker 0: only crazy cosplay people had a problem.

114
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,639
Speaker 1: not even crazy cosplay people.

115
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,759
Speaker 1: crazy Cosplay people on cosplay.com who like to complain about things.

116
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,956
Speaker 0: yep Another time, but the year that they had the the Larkin CL concert.

117
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:10,839
Speaker 0: I don't know TMR.

118
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,672
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm sorry the TMR can add TM revolution.

119
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,099
Speaker 0: was it really yes?

120
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,548
Speaker 0: Oh, I think no it had to be both.

121
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:23,530
Speaker 1: No you could you it was specifically that one because the chairs It was the chairs both time.

122
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,000
Speaker 1: no because the chairs in the arena can't be removed Scott.

123
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:32,300
Speaker 0: No the chairs in the arena were the chairs that we were on in the arena could be removed.

124
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,330
Speaker 1: It was the chair yeah, but most of them couldn't.

125
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,420
Speaker 1: and besides you asked the question during the TMR concert.

126
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,716
Speaker 1: I'm 100% sure that that is what that is.

127
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:40,123
Speaker 1: when this happened I don't know.

128
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:44,559
Speaker 1: I am sure because they were two separate years, and you wouldn't ask the same question two years in a row.

129
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:47,193
Speaker 0: But I don't think we went to the.

130
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,079
Speaker 1: yes we did.

131
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,265
Speaker 0: Anyway, I went to the.

132
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:58,840
Speaker 1: in fact you asked about it specifically because people behind us at the TMR concert Yelled at us because we were standing up during the concert.

133
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,410
Speaker 0: Anyway at one of the two concerts.

134
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:08,993
Speaker 0: I had the closing feedback session I asked how come there wasn't any you know general admission standing area.

135
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:21,850
Speaker 0: How come there are chairs from the front to the back and The guy was like yeah, we couldn't get that for security reasons, and I'm like well You know if you couldn't get it for security reasons Maybe you should just you know get more security or something.

136
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:27,180
Speaker 0: uh and then they're like this big guy stood up And he's like ah I'm the security blah.

137
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:28,890
Speaker 0: And then it was funny.

138
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:29,638
Speaker 0: and then I sat down.

139
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:38,498
Speaker 0: But then the guy who did who you know who was in charge of that for Otacon came over And he was like oh, I wanted general admission so bad, but I couldn't get it.

140
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:41,208
Speaker 0: And I was like it's cool.

141
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:41,930
Speaker 0: It's cool.

142
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Otacon really has their stuff together.

143
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,021
Speaker 1: They.

144
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,249
Speaker 1: this is probably the best run convention ever

145
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:47,731
Speaker 0: yep,

146
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:57,777
Speaker 1: and also a really cool thing is the new thing They started doing recently is that they show The winning anime music videos at one of the two which means you don't have to sit at

147
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:58,640
Speaker 0: the closing ceremony You

148
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,789
Speaker 1: don't have to sit through the anime music video contest.

149
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:08,618
Speaker 1: yeah the anime music video contest if you really like AMVs go to it, but I do and I at other cons I always go to it, but I don't have time to go to it at Otacon.

150
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:12,894
Speaker 0: yeah It's just it takes too long, and it's conflicts with the Friday concert.

151
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,560
Speaker 1: it conflicts with everything.

152
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

153
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,118
Speaker 0: it's not the greatest usage of time.

154
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:21,156
Speaker 1: now There's some things on the schedule that scare me this year.

155
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:33,115
Speaker 1: one There is a 18 plus meaning you have to be 18 And they'll check ID to get into this panel called Let's get social Friday afternoon, and that can't be anything other than hookups.

156
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:36,211
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell I know It has to be the hookup panel.

157
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:37,380
Speaker 0: It's actually a workshop.

158
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:38,579
Speaker 0: So it's a hookup workshop.

159
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,145
Speaker 1: I guess it's got to be.

160
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:47,679
Speaker 1: as far as I can guess it's probably just people who want to get with other people at the Con which seems to be the primary goal of a lot of people who go to Otacon.

161
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,449
Speaker 0: yeah But it's mostly the less than 18s who want to hook up But this is 18 plus only.

162
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:56,935
Speaker 1: so this is people who want to hook up But it's guaranteed that no one they hook up with will be illegal and underage.

163
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:58,380
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess that's okay.

164
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:03,014
Speaker 1: I think that's great, but maybe we should go to it And I want to go to it just to interview some people about it.

165
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:10,580
Speaker 1: Yeah One the 4chan panel is not 18 plus, but the panel both before it and after it are.

166
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:25,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the general gist is that the 4chan people agreed to follow some certain guidelines To prevent their panel from being 18 plus, but they put it late at night So the likelihood of under 18s going to it is kind of low.

167
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:33,472
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that Otacon has a hammer hanging over the 4chan panel And if anything happens this year, they are never coming back.

168
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure

169
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:49,229
Speaker 1: because last year They staged a fight between a guy who pretended to be a furry and a guy who pretended to be like a 4chan thug And they staged a fake Fight at the panel that almost got the police involved before they admitted that it was fake Mmm, and Otacon was like.

170
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,898
Speaker 1: you can't pull that shit here.

171
00:12:52,462 --> 00:12:57,223
Speaker 1: Now right before it is the hentai doujinshi panel Which no Great.

172
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:03,687
Speaker 1: right after it is a panel that if I'm not completely dead how to survive the zombie apocalypse Which is probably going to be hilarious

173
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:15,610
Speaker 0: and at the same time as the 4chan panel In fact so long that it starts before and ends after the 4chan panel is a workshop 18 plus do-it-yourself bukkake this.

174
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,894
Speaker 1: this scares the living hell out of me.

175
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:26,291
Speaker 1: if you don't know what bukkake is good first What I want you to do is go to Google Images and turn off safe search then type the word bukkake B-U-K-K-A-K-E.

176
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:28,163
Speaker 1: Into it.

177
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,734
Speaker 0: hit enter, but then don't do this if you're under 18.

178
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:32,698
Speaker 1: no no do this.

179
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:33,400
Speaker 1: do this right now.

180
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,667
Speaker 0: If you're under 18 don't do it.

181
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,095
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, cuz I we don't get in trouble now.

182
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:42,440
Speaker 1: before you click enter Find everyone in your family if you're at work find every find your boss, and then it enter.

183
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:44,944
Speaker 1: Don't actually do that.

184
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:47,250
Speaker 1: No bukkake is a horrible thing.

185
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,800
Speaker 0: So this is a frightening panel immensely frightening.

186
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:58,087
Speaker 1: I am going to this because I want to see what kind of freaks go in and then I want to interview them and ask Them what the hell they're thinking.

187
00:13:58,448 --> 00:14:01,120
Speaker 0: yeah, I think that's about pretty much the only scary stuff.

188
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:08,533
Speaker 1: Well the only other thing is that there is a yuri panel that not only does it not say 18 plus But it specifically says not 18 plus.

189
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:10,864
Speaker 0: Maybe they.

190
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:11,888
Speaker 0: you know they.

191
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,055
Speaker 0: they fought hard to get it to be not you know.

192
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:17,160
Speaker 0: what I wonder is that Shouldn't they just call to the shoujo eye pan?

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,660
Speaker 1: That's what I was about to say because yuri is a much more specific word than a lot of American fans seem to think.

194
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,790
Speaker 1: just Like yaoi yaoi doesn't mean boys liking each other.

195
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,938
Speaker 1: yaoi means boys doing things to each other.

196
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,406
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, all right now.

197
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:46,200
Speaker 0: as for our traditional incredibly violent late-night live-action movie You will note that video room 5 at Otacon is showing only live-action Asian cinema Which is awesome and a lot of the movies in there are awesome and a lot of the movies in there are.

198
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a half-hour movie.

199
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,473
Speaker 1: That's just called South Asian horror.

200
00:14:52,917 --> 00:15:04,140
Speaker 0: yep well I looked in at the what movies are playing late at night Friday and Saturday to figure out which one was ridiculously violent And I've checked out four of them that are look like good contenders.

201
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:13,100
Speaker 0: IMDb and I have short summaries lady Terminator is at like 1030 in video 5. of course on Friday.

202
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:22,563
Speaker 0: the only thing I have to say about this is She mates, and then she terminates After.

203
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:32,840
Speaker 0: that is art of the devil 2 which is supposedly a movie That's kind of slow for 40 minutes But then after 40 minutes because it's no it's an hour and a half 90 minute movie.

204
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:35,360
Speaker 0: So the second 50 minutes are ultra-violent.

205
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,130
Speaker 1: Yep, so maybe we'll go.

206
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,740
Speaker 1: we haven't decided which one we're going to yet.

207
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, we are to the devil - looks like a good contender because it feels like one of those horrible horrible movies.

208
00:15:45,918 --> 00:16:08,479
Speaker 0: It's not good Saturday night at 9 they're showing G goku which is there are like three movies and IMDb named G goku and G goku I'm pretty sure means hell in Japanese and They are all had to do with Japanese hell, so I'm not sure if it's gonna be ultra-violent if it's gonna be about you know learning a lesson or anything like that.

209
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,306
Speaker 1: of course the One after it is called sex and fury.

210
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,940
Speaker 0: yeah now sex and fury was described on IMDb as being a specific genre of pink violence.

211
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,900
Speaker 0: Basically the movie is full of not ultra-violence, but just kind of normal over-the-top violence with lots of TNA.

212
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,327
Speaker 0: So that's also a pretty good contender.

213
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:34,899
Speaker 0: You know because you got the TNA combined with the better than American cinema violence It could be good that could be the one.

214
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:37,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll basically make the decision at the con.

215
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:44,685
Speaker 1: So you'll have had to track us down at some point to figure out what the ultra-violent movie is that we are all going to Go to and yell about.

216
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:52,420
Speaker 0: and of course you know if at any time There's a good chance that we randomly hang around video 5 when the con is at a low point.

217
00:16:52,701 --> 00:17:00,032
Speaker 1: Yes, also if you don't go to the concert on Friday You must must go to video 4 at 7 30 p.m.

218
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,714
Speaker 1: And watch Lupin the third strange psychokinetic strategy.

219
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,140
Speaker 0: That's a live-action.

220
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:08,472
Speaker 0: Lupin the third movie.

221
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:09,319
Speaker 0: that's awesome.

222
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:21,460
Speaker 1: It is badass And I even missed the first 15 minutes of it because I was asleep in the hotel room a little hungover and Scott Johnson Comes back from the movie wakes me up and forces me to get dressed to come down and watch it.

223
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,780
Speaker 0: I think it might be available on DVD though.

224
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,223
Speaker 0: I think that's why it's being shown at all these cons that someone's selling it and if I see in the dealers room I'm gonna get it.

225
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:29,431
Speaker 1: if the movie hadn't been good.

226
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,100
Speaker 1: I would have killed him, but the movie was awesome.

227
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:39,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, also at 2 o'clock and video 4 on Friday They're showing perfect your earth defense force, which is supposedly hilarious.

228
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,546
Speaker 0: Anime world order bets their lives on it.

229
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll say and if I don't buy in the dealers room.

230
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:46,439
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go watch it there.

231
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:50,150
Speaker 0: All right, what else looks really interesting at this con?

232
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,611
Speaker 1: I don't know.

233
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,820
Speaker 1: everything else is pretty standard con fair.

234
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:54,320
Speaker 1: I really need to read the descriptions.

235
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,400
Speaker 1: I mean video 7 is gonna have a bunch of premieres Saturday from all the companies.

236
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,589
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's a Voltron special in video 7 from media blasters.

237
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,794
Speaker 0: Who's putting out all those Voltron DVDs.

238
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:12,200
Speaker 1: at 9 o'clock on Saturday They're showing Cromartie the movie Which I missed at several other cons.

239
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:17,620
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll have to go see that but overlapping that is animal treasure island and the transform.

240
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:18,342
Speaker 0: Oh, I got.

241
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:20,028
Speaker 0: I really want to see animal treasure island.

242
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,540
Speaker 1: That's a classic old-school anime panel and the masquerade.

243
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:26,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think mother animal treasure island might win.

244
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:29,222
Speaker 0: That's an old-school Tezuka thing.

245
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:33,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you need a census to the scale of Otakon consider this.

246
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:38,179
Speaker 1: most cons would never put major events Conflicting with each other at all.

247
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:49,480
Speaker 1: Like to have the ANV contest at the same time as a concert would be crazy because everyone goes to every big event Otakon so big that they have to do it that way because there's so many people.

248
00:18:49,560 --> 00:19:00,234
Speaker 0: yeah, imagine if you have like a your main the main events room at your convention is as holds 5,000 people and so at your Cosplay everyone shows up and you have an ANV contest.

249
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:01,559
Speaker 0: That's where most people are gonna be.

250
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:10,419
Speaker 0: so if you put them both at the same time You're gonna force people to choose between one and the other and you're basically gonna split your con in half And a lot of people are gonna be angry.

251
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,836
Speaker 1: There is no room at Otakon that can hold all of Otakon.

252
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:18,060
Speaker 0: well except for the arena Yeah, but even that which is why they got the arena for the cosplay.

253
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,176
Speaker 1: Yes, if everyone wants to go to the cosplay they can arrange it.

254
00:19:21,196 --> 00:19:21,498
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

255
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:25,780
Speaker 0: But other than that, there is nothing at Otakon that can accommodate everyone.

256
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:31,460
Speaker 0: So they put as many awesome things simultaneous to each other to keep the people spread out.

257
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:35,874
Speaker 0: You know fill up everything as opposed to having one overflowing bucket.

258
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,580
Speaker 0: They have you know, so much water.

259
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:38,678
Speaker 0: They get a lot of small buckets.

260
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:42,412
Speaker 1: Yeah, Otakon does provide a lot of water which is very key.

261
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:43,134
Speaker 0: Lots of what.

262
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:44,620
Speaker 0: there's free water everywhere.

263
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:51,840
Speaker 0: Make sure you take advantage of it or else you will dehydrate because you're being air-conditioned in the convention center and it's hot as hell outside.

264
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:53,465
Speaker 0: You don't realize.

265
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:55,011
Speaker 0: you're dehydrating in the air conditioning.

266
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:55,995
Speaker 0: drink water a lot.

267
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,020
Speaker 0: you're doing a lot of walking.

268
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:58,884
Speaker 1: Yes Also, don't forget to eat.

269
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:00,149
Speaker 1: eat a lot of food.

270
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:03,460
Speaker 1: eat more food than you think you need because you go to eat.

271
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:06,285
Speaker 0: You should become full After you eat.

272
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,497
Speaker 0: every single time you eat lunch and dinner.

273
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,800
Speaker 1: now We'll have a lot to say about the food because this year the food situation might be a little different.

274
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,253
Speaker 1: But if you have at all any problems with food at the con.

275
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,940
Speaker 1: go across the street to the mall.

276
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:21,419
Speaker 1: They have amazing food and they give discounts to Otakon people they know.

277
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,527
Speaker 0: Yeah remember when I talked about those escalators.

278
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:34,793
Speaker 0: if you go up those escalators in the the water and The fountain room the big giant lobby the cosplay lobby Yeah, you turn left and you go out the con out those doors and keep going.

279
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,100
Speaker 0: You'll eventually go across the sky walk.

280
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:43,272
Speaker 0: You'll see everyone's going this way to a mall and a food court and that is the best place to get Normal kind of food.

281
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:46,389
Speaker 1: be warned There is nowhere to sit there.

282
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:56,919
Speaker 1: that place will be as crowded as Otakon for the entire Convention and there'll be a lot of normal people who are just in the inner harbor for the weekend Just not knowing what to do and freaking out.

283
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:02,474
Speaker 0: Yeah If you don't show up there to eat at strange times, like if you don't want to eat at like 10 a.m.

284
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:10,054
Speaker 0: And 3 p.m You're not gonna find a seat there and let without you a fight Especially if you bring a large crew with you.

285
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:14,617
Speaker 0: if you go alone You'll probably might find a chair somewhere if you bring your friends.

286
00:21:14,738 --> 00:21:15,019
Speaker 0: give up.

287
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:18,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically don't expect to eat lunch with the front row crew.

288
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:21,860
Speaker 1: In fact, the front row crew does not eat lunch with the front row crew.

289
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:27,160
Speaker 1: We go in groups of one to three at random times all day for breakfast and lunches.

290
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:31,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes we just grab our breakfast before the con starts in a small breakfast nook.

291
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,027
Speaker 1: Yep However, generally Saturday night.

292
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:38,183
Speaker 1: at some point though, maybe this year because of all the stuff going on Saturday We'll do it Friday night.

293
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:42,717
Speaker 1: We get the everyone involved and associated with us.

294
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:46,570
Speaker 1: last year We had like 19 or 20 or maybe I'm more than that.

295
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:46,790
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

296
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:49,640
Speaker 1: Go to fud Rucker's in a giant blob.

297
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:56,660
Speaker 0: Yes, if you walk down the road towards the ESPN Whatever it is, you know the power plant concert place is down that way.

298
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,408
Speaker 0: Also, you will see a fud Rucker's eat there.

299
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,236
Speaker 0: eat there at least once during the convention sometime.

300
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,444
Speaker 1: don't order a milkshake Why not?

301
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:06,255
Speaker 1: they will not be able to accommodate you.

302
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:10,819
Speaker 1: that place Cannot accommodate the number of people from Otacon to try to eat at it.

303
00:22:11,222 --> 00:22:13,120
Speaker 0: Well, if it's not crowded when you go you can get a milkshake.

304
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,626
Speaker 0: It just takes a long time for them to make them.

305
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:18,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless they forget your milkshake and also they have a one-pound hamburger, right?

306
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,145
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

307
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:20,707
Speaker 1: Yeah.

308
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,440
Speaker 0: Oh don't eat that unless your stomach's real big now.

309
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,960
Speaker 1: The other thing we usually do is we go to a fancy restaurant one of the other days.

310
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:29,239
Speaker 0: Don't come to us at the fancy restaurant if you don't know us.

311
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:34,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, but well if you try to follow us to the fancy restaurant You'll know if we're going to the fancy restaurant one.

312
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:38,280
Speaker 1: You probably won't have enough money because even our friends don't have enough money.

313
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,166
Speaker 1: We barely squeak by every year.

314
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:44,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, and two that is like the front row crew like private dinner.

315
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:46,128
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't you don't get to come.

316
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:47,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless we invite you.

317
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:48,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're invited you can come.

318
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,239
Speaker 1: I mean last year we had a good 18 or 19 people just at that one and we took up like the entire.

319
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:06,035
Speaker 1: we took up an entire giant table to the point that Like we were separated at this one table into like eight groups that were each Individually talking in a small conversation unrelated to everyone else.

320
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:07,140
Speaker 1: It was that many people.

321
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, usually, you know you go to eat somewhere and the whole table is one conversation or two conversations.

322
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,708
Speaker 0: this one was like six or seven conversations.

323
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:19,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I was sitting on the end talking to Ido and Brian and Completely independent of that there were other conversations going on.

324
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's crazy big table Let's see.

325
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:24,833
Speaker 0: I'm sure there was something else on here.

326
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:26,159
Speaker 0: That was interesting and I missed it.

327
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:35,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the thing is I I highlighted events I'm interested in going to and I have highlighted something at every single point in the entire convention.

328
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:44,240
Speaker 1: and This does not even include The video game room the dealers room the artist alley the art show everything else we're doing at the con.

329
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:49,800
Speaker 0: You're probably not gonna see us in the video game room more than maybe once just so we can look at the video game room.

330
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:53,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, generally what we tend to do at Otacon is look at the video game room once and then leave it.

331
00:23:53,841 --> 00:24:00,653
Speaker 1: I mean, I like to play DDR at cons But we're going to Wildwood to play on the brand new ninth mix machines that you

332
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:01,797
Speaker 0: are supernova that

333
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:03,986
Speaker 1: just came from Japan Recently, so it's

334
00:24:04,006 --> 00:24:10,820
Speaker 0: like I can play video games any time While I'm at Otacon, I have to do things that you know are awesome to Otacon.

335
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:20,589
Speaker 0: So I'm not gonna spend my time playing video games or I would enter tournaments if they were interesting tournaments and not the same typical Halo Smash Brothers tournaments that you see everywhere

336
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,740
Speaker 1: and also I guess one kind of final kind of warning to all of our fans Hang out with us at the con.

337
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:35,129
Speaker 1: I definitely we want to hang out with you But if we all head back to our hotel room to plan something unless we specifically invite you to come We've had situations in the past with people.

338
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,919
Speaker 1: We don't really know just trying to follow us back to the hotel room.

339
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:46,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if we if you're invited to the hotel room You'll know it because we'll specifically invite you probably because we want to interview you or do something.

340
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:53,460
Speaker 0: If no one says to you, hey you come with us then don't come with us to places.

341
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,424
Speaker 0: But any place

342
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:55,829
Speaker 1: any place outside of the con

343
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,699
Speaker 0: exactly if we're at the convention, you can do whatever the hell you want Yeah, unless I say because then if you annoy me, I'll say go away

344
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:09,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also you can try to hang out with us at lunch But we're not going to save you a seat because we don't even save each other seats.

345
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:12,956
Speaker 1: It is definitely a fight to the death over food indeed indeed.

346
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:20,500
Speaker 1: So this is the last normal episode of geek nights until we get back from Wildwood and Otacon and everything.

347

Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

350
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:28,995
Speaker 1: So think about that work ethic.

351
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:31,565
Speaker 1: even when we're on vacation There are still podcasts going up.

352
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:32,749
