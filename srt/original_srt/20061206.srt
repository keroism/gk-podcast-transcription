1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,008
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday December 6th.

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,877
Speaker 0: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek notes.

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:19,579
Speaker 1: tonight We begin a very long and in-depth series on the proper care and feeding of anime clubs.

4
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,343
Speaker 1: Life is good.

6
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:29,900
Speaker 1: I just finished a gigantic vanilla ice cream and orange juice smoothie that I made not moments ago.

7
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:33,078
Speaker 0: Let's not really a smoothie if it doesn't have like yogurt and stuff, right?

8
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:37,476
Speaker 1: I consider a smoothie to be pretty much any whipped thing.

9
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:38,540
Speaker 1: That isn't a milkshake.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:38,781
Speaker 1: Like.

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,176
Speaker 1: it's a little less viscous than a milkshake and you drink it through a straw.

12
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:43,080
Speaker 1: It's a smoothie.

13
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:44,835
Speaker 0: so I don't know.

14
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:50,144
Speaker 0: cuz If you just combine orange juice and ice cream It's not really a milkshake.

15
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:55,662
Speaker 0: because to make a milkshake you need you need a ice cream and milk and then you know That's a.

16
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:56,909
Speaker 1: actually when I was a kid.

17
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,860
Speaker 1: I used to make milkshakes, but I never used milk.

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,711
Speaker 1: I pretty much just use ice cream and vanilla extract.

19
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,879
Speaker 1: Maybe I'd use like a teaspoon of milk.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,204
Speaker 0: Hmm stuff call.

21
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:13,940
Speaker 0: we got to go figure out exactly the difference between like a smoothie a milkshake What all the ice all kinds of different?

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,619
Speaker 1: I think a more important thing would be to figure out whether or not cheesecake is a chip as a cake or a pie or something else entirely.

23
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,368
Speaker 0: It's tough call not really.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,238
Speaker 1: no, it's not it is not at all.

25
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:31,139
Speaker 1: We had that argument to completion years and years ago, I forget which side I was on.

26
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:33,718
Speaker 1: Well, then I guess I win.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,926
Speaker 0: Okay, what side were you on?

28
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:36,568
Speaker 1: doesn't matter?

29
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,300
Speaker 0: Okay, then are you sure you weren't on the same side as me?

30
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,568
Speaker 1: I'm absolutely sure cuz I remember arguing with you about it.

31
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,036
Speaker 0: I probably just picked the other side for fun.

32
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,088
Speaker 0: Oh Really?

33
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,179
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

34
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,283
Speaker 0: I don't really care.

35
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,607
Speaker 0: either way cuz you know what.

36
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,860
Speaker 0: whether you call it cake or pie it tastes the awesome.

37
00:01:55,542 --> 00:02:07,160
Speaker 1: So anyway in response to the other day when I used a slightly different thing of the day music I'm surprised so many people brought it up because you see I was messing around with that keyboard.

38
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:12,059
Speaker 1: So I decided oh I'll record some stupid bit and throw it in the show to make fun of me messing around with the keyboard.

39
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:19,720
Speaker 1: and I've gotten more emails and feedback of people saying how much they liked it or how they want more music like that in the show.

40
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:23,232
Speaker 1: I made that as a joke in my when I was bored.

41
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,700
Speaker 1: That's not gonna be the thing of the day music ever.

42
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,938
Speaker 1: I don't even have the wav file anymore.

43
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:37,733
Speaker 0: and The scarier part is that rim just basically banging on the keyboard is somehow sounds good to people Like what the hell?

44
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:40,507
Speaker 1: Well, I bang on the keyboard all the time.

45
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,050
Speaker 1: What do you want?

46
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but it's not good.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,680
Speaker 1: I mean, well, I don't know what your standard is gov good is?

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,200
Speaker 1: I mean you have kind of weird tastes and just about everything.

49
00:02:49,662 --> 00:03:01,280
Speaker 0: I think it's more like relatively speaking like you could not be a keyboardist for even like well Maybe the most garages of bands you could be the keyboardist, but if entertainment system needed a keyboardist I could do it.

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,389
Speaker 0: I could also be their drummer perhaps, but I don't think you.

51
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,223
Speaker 0: you're in a very low level of keyboarding talent Compared to.

52
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:12,136
Speaker 1: here's the thing if you take the average person in the world.

53
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:17,460
Speaker 0: I'm well above average But compared to all the keyboardists in the world that you are down near the bottom.

54
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:21,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but I'm still pretty good according to our listeners.

55
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:23,766
Speaker 0: You know what that tells us.

56
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,594
Speaker 0: your listeners don't know much about keyboarding.

57
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:26,458
Speaker 1: I don't know.

58
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:32,940
Speaker 0: Speaking of listener feedback two people sent us odios and you know what odeo fucked.

59
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:45,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, odeo has never really been the most reliable useful or really in any way relevant or interesting Service to be perfectly honest yeah, and now that we finally decide to use them they don't work.

60
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,761
Speaker 0: But we've been using them It's just.

61
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:53,600
Speaker 0: no one actually sent us anything and in fact people did send us a couple things in the past and it did work.

62
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,543
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

63
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:59,217
Speaker 0: I emailed odeo, and I'm like hey fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it

64
00:03:59,337 --> 00:03:59,899
Speaker 1: fix it fix it

65
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:09,139
Speaker 0: and we'll see if they fix it or not, but I Think if it's not fixed pretty soon And I'm gonna try testing it to see if I can make it work and it's gonna send ourselves an odeo.

66
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,810
Speaker 0: And you know try different things.

67
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:24,498
Speaker 0: if I can't make it work I'm just gonna give odeo the big double deuce and We'll make fun of them and tell everyone never to use them again, and you can just send mp3s attached to emails yep And also in the the mini contest we're having.

68
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:27,954
Speaker 1: We said we wanted it to be 30 seconds long.

69
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,416
Speaker 0: Yeah The two odios that we got that we were unable to listen to because odeo sucks.

70
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:38,112
Speaker 0: one of them was 11 minutes long and one of them was 5 minutes long.

71
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,480
Speaker 0: That's a lot more than 30 seconds.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,448
Speaker 1: Are you sure they weren't 11 in 5 seconds?

73
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:44,959
Speaker 0: I'm sure absolutely sure.

74
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:49,379
Speaker 0: No, oh, okay, but I'm estimating to the nearest minute.

75
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,247
Speaker 0: Either way much too long people.

76
00:04:53,628 --> 00:05:00,539
Speaker 1: yeah, no matter you I guess I'll put it this way in order for us to play an 11 minute Audio that would have to be some fucking speech.

77
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:01,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean look at it.

78
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:12,776
Speaker 0: We spend maybe 20 minutes on the show before the things of the day and then like 30 or 40 minutes after that 11 minutes you're getting like a fifth or a sixth of the show.

79
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:18,039
Speaker 0: just to yourself Even five minutes you're getting like one dozen of the show.

80
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:28,514
Speaker 1: So I guess what I'm gonna do is for all the long odios we get I'll listen to him cut him down into something that might Not exactly represent what you were trying to say and play that.

81
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,040
Speaker 0: yeah, and you can't complain.

82
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,226
Speaker 1: No one can complain anyway.

83
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:38,731
Speaker 0: I know but if you we like voice feedback, but if it's too long It's not gonna get played of course.

84
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:39,694
Speaker 1: now everyone's thinking well.

85
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,100
Speaker 1: I'll just give geek nights the double-deuce.

86
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 1: They want audio feedback, but they don't want it to be too long, but now audio doesn't work.

87
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:45,803
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

88
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

89
00:05:47,449 --> 00:06:00,546
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway in the news it being anime day I would just like to note that for kids who among other licenses had one piece has decided to stop Translating it and be done with it.

90
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,952
Speaker 1: They have aired 78 of the 104 episodes they had and that's the end of it.

91
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,879
Speaker 1: I imagine that one piece wasn't really doing so well in the u.s.

92
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,374
Speaker 0: Well the part of the problem is one they were not mark.

93
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:18,331
Speaker 0: one piece is something that Was only really popular among the anime crowd.

94
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:21,265
Speaker 1: yeah, and even then a small subset of the anime It is.

95
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:26,040
Speaker 0: it is not like a. I mean It's a big show in terms of its size especially in Japan.

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,553
Speaker 0: It's crazy popular, and it's a lot of stuff.

97
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:29,900
Speaker 0: It is a lot of episodes.

98
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,331
Speaker 0: There's a lot of movies as a lot of manga.

99
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:38,995
Speaker 0: one piece is a lot of stuff But it's not really popular enough to sell all that stuff.

100
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:42,620
Speaker 0: to make matters worse They brought it over to the u.s.

101
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:47,840
Speaker 0: And tried to make it a kids show and not complete with animation with the editing required.

102
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:59,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, they edited the hell out of it And they put it on you know like Saturday morning cartoons for kids or get home from school cartoons for kids Instead of you know making it a show for anime fans.

103
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,238
Speaker 0: That is on DVDs unedited with subtitles, and we all buy it and we're all happy.

104
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:10,688
Speaker 1: yep I mean I just think to back to the cons for the last several years where there would be More one piece stuff than anything else.

105
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,620
Speaker 1: one piece stuff was everywhere and still a lot of it out there.

106
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't see a lot of people buying it and I every year I've seen the prices on the big one piece plushies going down.

107
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:28,680
Speaker 0: yep I mean I was reading the one piece manga and I can already tell like I watched the first few episodes of one piece back In the day, and I kind of liked it because it was party.

108
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:32,176
Speaker 0: But then I knew that it was gonna turn into like some fighting things.

109
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,408
Speaker 0: so I got the manga And it was okay.

110
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,719
Speaker 0: even if it was a little childish It was still funny and interesting.

111
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:41,175
Speaker 0: But then it reached this stretch of like three or four volumes of manga.

112
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:44,350
Speaker 0: that where it went nowhere And it was like one fight, and I'm like all right.

113
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,671
Speaker 0: That's it.

114
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:45,696
Speaker 0: I'm done ordering this.

115
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:46,580
Speaker 0: I'm done with one piece.

116
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:48,379
Speaker 1: Why did you keep reading even that long?

117
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,822
Speaker 1: I dropped one piece after the first volume because I knew exactly where it was going and I already gotten everything out of it I ever would.

118
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:55,464
Speaker 0: well anyway.

119
00:07:55,846 --> 00:08:05,180
Speaker 0: I stopped ordering it and the last volume that I received right Was a good was a volume where it stopped the fight and got back to the stuff that makes one piece not suck.

120
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:11,460
Speaker 0: So I think I'm gonna like go to the store and read it now And then I can pick it up and say oh this whole volume is one fight.

121
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,413
Speaker 0: I'll just put it back on the shelf, and if it's a good volume.

122
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,120
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll buy it and bring it home.

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,326
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll just read it in the store.

124
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:17,627
Speaker 0: who knows?

125
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:25,075
Speaker 1: see I don't understand how when it comes to anime You'll drop an anime like a brick in in less than 10 seconds.

126
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:32,626
Speaker 1: if you don't think you like it yet You'll continue to read one piece or initial D long after they've Stopped being good.

127
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,712
Speaker 0: initial D. Still good.

128
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:35,239
Speaker 0: It's not second of all.

129
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,102
Speaker 1: no It's not.

130
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:40,460
Speaker 0: initial part of the reason is that I'm ordering these things two months in advance now.

131
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:44,097
Speaker 0: So if it sucks I usually end up getting all right.

132
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:44,580
Speaker 1: all right.

133
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,656
Speaker 1: I could predict that the rest of fourth stage was gonna suck.

134
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:52,089
Speaker 1: from the beginning They ran out of ways to go with initial D.

135
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,551
Speaker 0: There's.

136
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:56,100
Speaker 0: no I thought that but the manga it keeps going in ways.

137
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:57,508
Speaker 1: What ways?

138
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,559
Speaker 1: oh he wins this race by?

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,068
Speaker 1: Balancing his tires over a gap.

140
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:06,497
Speaker 1: Oh he wins this race by fucking teleporting to the bottom.

141
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:13,040
Speaker 1: awesome The show pretty much the initial D ended for me at the end of the first season.

142
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:16,714
Speaker 1: Yeah with the possible exception is definitely better.

143
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:17,456
Speaker 0: I will agree.

144
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,925
Speaker 0: however I still enjoy.

145
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:24,160
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say it's like top quality shit, but it's still good.

146
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:26,075
Speaker 1: It's like the difference between chocolate and shit.

147
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:29,048
Speaker 0: no But that is an initial D reference.

148
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,696
Speaker 1: so yes from what you know what from the first season.

149
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:35,109
Speaker 1: Yep anyway Yeah, so you got some anime related news.

150
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:37,860
Speaker 0: I hear it's not really so much in news as it is.

151
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,507
Speaker 0: Hey look at this article about anime.

152
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,137
Speaker 0: There's an article on reason calm Called when piracy becomes promotion.

153
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:50,954
Speaker 0: how unauthorized copying made Japanese animation profitable in the United States.

154
00:09:51,396 --> 00:10:01,520
Speaker 0: the article is by Henry Jenkins Who is the director of the MIT comparative media studies program and author of convergence culture?

155
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,822
Speaker 0: Blah blah blah.

156
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:05,972
Speaker 0: he would like to acknowledge the help of MIT alum Sean Leonard.

157
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,159
Speaker 0: that tells me that Sean Leonard did all the work.

158
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,760
Speaker 0: Anyway I'm gonna sum up this article by just reading to you the last two sentences.

159
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:16,460
Speaker 0: Many media companies in the u.s.

160
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,880
Speaker 0: Would have regarded all this underground circulation as piracy and shut it down before it reached critical mass.

161
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:30,440
Speaker 0: Instead we have moved from a world where a speed racer Operated on the fringes to one where Pokemon is better known in the United States than many of its American counterparts.

162
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,360
Speaker 0: Yep, here's a smart guy telling you that fan subbing is the awesome and Japanese people are smart and American people are stupid.

163
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:38,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, though.

164
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:42,880
Speaker 1: I still have a lot of choice words for the Japanese animation companies.

165
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:51,588
Speaker 0: Well, I think the problem is they just don't understand that they can't charge that much money for To sell the licenses in America.

166
00:10:51,608 --> 00:11:02,540
Speaker 0: and if they're pissed off that someone else is gonna Sell the shows in America for more money than they're paying the licenses for than the Japanese companies should just release the anime here themselves.

167
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:06,516
Speaker 0: And you know get rid of people like the middleman ADV and such.

168
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:09,789
Speaker 1: yeah, though I don't think they quite understand the American market though.

169
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,920
Speaker 1: I don't think the American companies quite understand the American.

170
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,651
Speaker 0: I don't think the Japanese people understand the Japanese market.

171
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:17,720
Speaker 0: sell your DVDs for like a hajillion dollars.

172
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,566
Speaker 1: No They understand it perfectly well because they make a lot of money and the only threat to that is Re-importation in American fan subs now.

173
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:29,340
Speaker 0: I still really think that if someone released DVDs in Japan.

174
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:32,819
Speaker 0: Like let's say I was an anime company and I made an anime in Japan and it was on TV.

175
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,845
Speaker 0: And then I came out with the DVDs.

176
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:45,158
Speaker 0: if I put those DVDs out in slim cases and boxes at American DVD prices I'm pretty sure I would make more money than the Japanese companies.

177
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,812
Speaker 0: that they're $40,000 collector things.

178
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:48,596
Speaker 1: you know what I would do.

179
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:58,153
Speaker 1: first I'd release the fanboy early copies for the crazy amount of money because they'll buy it no matter what and As soon as sales drop below a predefined threshold.

180
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:03,779
Speaker 1: I will immediately Release the cheaper versions the thin the thin cases.

181
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:13,300
Speaker 1: I really as soon as sales of those start dropping off I'll release the super double bonus box that comes with a goodie because the fan buys will all buy that again.

182
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:28,111
Speaker 0: And I would also if I was a Japanese company is I would hire a translator slap some English subtitles on there And send it over to the US like when the Japanese DVD comes out the American DVD comes out Simultaneously from my company directly.

183
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:34,375
Speaker 1: now once none of those middleman business I would hire the fan subbers to do it because they're really good at what they do really quick.

184
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:34,817
Speaker 0: Yep.

185
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:35,299
Speaker 0: Yep.

186
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:35,479
Speaker 0: Yep.

187
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:35,620
Speaker 0: Yep.

188
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:39,319
Speaker 1: Yeah We should probably do a whole show on that?

189
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably that the thing is you know and you think about a show like one piece.

190
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:48,373
Speaker 0: That's perfect for this kind of plan because selling one piece on DVDs.

191
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:57,660
Speaker 0: You know there's a whole lot of episodes There's not a whole lot of fans But you want to make money because you spent money to make one piece or you spent money to get the license.

192
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,004
Speaker 0: So what do you do?

193
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:07,080
Speaker 0: you slap a whole bunch of episodes on as few DVDs as possible and sell them as cheaply as possible And that's how you make the big money's with one piece.

194
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:14,262
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe not because a lot at least in my eyes any show that isn't grade a that I want to own and show to People forever.

195
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:21,346
Speaker 1: it would have to be so amazingly cheap for me to buy it when I could just watch it on Netflix for Practically nothing instead.

196
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:23,697
Speaker 0: yeah, but then you would Netflix it which means Netflix buys it.

197
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:29,820
Speaker 1: yeah But here's the thing Netflix buys far fewer copies of any given anime than the number of people who watch that copy.

198
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:38,700
Speaker 1: You got to admit though that if one piece was ten episodes a disc for If I wouldn't go anywhere near that show cuz I know where that show goes you would work.

199
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,269
Speaker 0: But imagine what it would sell to normal people's.

200
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,620
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was unedited and properly done.

201
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,020
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there was unedited knowledge.

202
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,460
Speaker 1: But even then I don't think you'd make as much money as the people in Japan make by selling it for a lot of money.

203
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:54,240
Speaker 0: That's just because it's more popular in Japan.

204
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,420
Speaker 0: I think you know when you have a lot of stuff, and it's not very popular you have to sell it.

205
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:05,588
Speaker 1: Yeah Well I agree with you in that one piece is already pretty much failed over here And they have the license until it expires.

206
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:08,297
Speaker 1: they already paid for the license as far as we know.

207
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,160
Speaker 1: I mean for all we know.

208
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:17,660
Speaker 1: Maybe the license is weird, but you'd think they would do whatever they could to recoup their losses And it doesn't cost too much to print up pieces of plastic.

209
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:25,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if they have even if they haven't made a profit yet They're either gonna lose more money, or they could just flood the market with super cheap one piece DVDs.

210
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:31,956
Speaker 1: one It'll sabotage anyone who wants the license in the future, and maybe they could negotiate a better deal if they ever wanted to pick it up again.

211
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:35,793
Speaker 1: And two they would at least recoup their losses.

212
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:44,099
Speaker 0: well that is a good thought though It's like if you flood the market now Maybe you can make more money by selling the license to someone else.

213
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:45,889
Speaker 0: Then you can buy.

214
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,900
Speaker 0: you know selling a whole bunch of DVDs now.

215
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:57,553
Speaker 1: Or maybe if you're evil threaten the Japanese company and say we have this license pony up reduce the cost something some sort of extortion.

216
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,399
Speaker 1: or We're going to sell one piece a dollar a disc.

217
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,209
Speaker 0: I think the license like prevents you from doing.

218
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:14,455
Speaker 1: see I was about to ask I wonder what provisions the licenses have for minimum sale prices or Levels of promotion or number of episodes per set or per disc.

219
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:15,820
Speaker 0: who knows it's all crazy.

220
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:17,929
Speaker 1: I wish the anime industry would open up.

221
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,340
Speaker 1: I know anime world orders talked about this time and time again.

222
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:21,788
Speaker 1: Why all the secrecy?

223
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:23,779
Speaker 1: they're not gaining anything from us not knowing?

224
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:31,000
Speaker 0: well That's something I gotta have a problem with most companies is what does any company have to gain for being secret besides pissing off?

225
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,168
Speaker 0: customers and Covering up corruption?

226
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,044
Speaker 1: well, no I can see them keeping you know Proprietary trade secret.

227
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:47,559
Speaker 1: oh yeah, yeah, but even more like production schedules or upcoming products that might not be made Because people get super pissed if they hear about a product that you know.

228
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:55,100
Speaker 1: Oh Sony's working on the blah blah blah And then the blah blah blah never comes because Sony while they were working on it realized it was a bad idea and canceled it.

229
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:56,832
Speaker 1: But the fanboys heard about it.

230
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:57,800
Speaker 1: now they wanted anyway.

231
00:15:57,926 --> 00:16:04,659
Speaker 0: Yes But on the whole companies have more to gain from being open and most companies are far more closed than they need to be now.

232
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,380
Speaker 1: I'll agree with you on that especially the anime industry.

233
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,449
Speaker 1: This is not rocket science.

234
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,462
Speaker 0: the other thing is you don't have to make a press release about everything You know.

235
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:13,027
Speaker 0: you don't to be that.

236
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:17,547
Speaker 0: It's just that if someone asks Tell them you know and then only made.

237
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:21,640
Speaker 0: only the really really enthusiastic people are gonna even pay attention to that.

238
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:29,040
Speaker 0: So I mean if you let some nerd on the internet know about your new gadget You're making you know maybe a few people here, and there will go.

239
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,431
Speaker 1: But then again I realized something.

240
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:38,259
Speaker 1: look at all the interviews you see with anime Company people at cons because that's where most of these interviews happen.

241
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:46,928
Speaker 1: No one even asks the hard-hitting questions and at a con the only questions you get are the stupid lame You gonna get blah show?

242
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:49,458
Speaker 1: or when is episode blog gonna come out?

243
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,204
Speaker 0: well You know the one quite.

244
00:16:51,244 --> 00:17:00,571
Speaker 0: I had one hard-hitting question for a TV at Otacon, and that was what the fuck happened to your manga and Still don't have a real complete answer.

245
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,037
Speaker 0: They were like yeah, it's coming back.

246
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,339
Speaker 0: Yeah something Yeah, it's like why don't you tell me you know yeah?

247
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,894
Speaker 0: We did this in this and that screwed us over, and this is what we're doing right now And this is the person working on it, and this is where we're at.

248
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:13,223
Speaker 0: and that way you know I go.

249
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:15,299
Speaker 0: oh instead of leaving me in the dark like

250
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:32,934
Speaker 1: Maybe we should add some of these smaller cons Show up with our equipment and do our stuff like we always do and then if we run into any anime industry people Corner them and ask the hard-hitting questions, and if they answer we win.

251
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,698
Speaker 1: if they don't answer we still win.

252
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:45,415
Speaker 1: well They they usually say we cannot confirm or deny blah blah And then I'll say why and I'll be a complete jerk until I get the information I want or I have proof that they're dodging the issue.

253
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:56,296
Speaker 1: hoo-hah That's the geek night's away Things of the day.

254
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,946
Speaker 1: we've got double Asian action today.

255
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:02,100
Speaker 0: Oh No, it's those crazy Asians.

256
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:03,849
Speaker 0: What do they come up with next yep?

257
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:12,697
Speaker 1: We have uncovered the vast Asian conspiracy, and we've discovered a technique that is unknown to the West Alright, so who wants to go first.

258
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:13,882
Speaker 0: I guess you can okay.

259
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:19,565
Speaker 0: I found this video And it said behold the Asian squat.

260
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:28,024
Speaker 0: and of course the first thing I thought of were those Asian squat toilets, so I watched it You know and to learn how to use a squat toilet even though I kind of knew how already.

261
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:32,122
Speaker 0: and then I realized This is not a video about the squat toilet.

262
00:18:32,564 --> 00:18:34,432
Speaker 0: This is a video about just Squatting.

263
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:37,200
Speaker 0: and I watched the video and I saw.

264
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:45,287
Speaker 0: and the first thing you see in the video is this Asian guy looking all cool With the sunglasses and these squats and you go yep, that's the way Asian people squat.

265
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:50,585
Speaker 0: I can see it right there You know so typical I've seen it in a million places before and you watch it some more.

266
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:54,577
Speaker 0: and they say Look at this Western guy squat, and you go wow.

267
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:59,230
Speaker 0: and then they actually point out the difference, and it's like yeah, it's true.

268
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:09,522
Speaker 0: The thing is I try I realized because they it's pretty much plain as day that the Asian squat is superior in many ways But I can't do it.

269
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,390
Speaker 0: I like fell over.

270
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,196
Speaker 1: It was kind of sad.

271
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:15,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the Asian squat is not easy to do.

272
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,753
Speaker 0: the difference is Asian people.

273
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:22,164
Speaker 0: when they squat they put their heels on the ground and they shift.

274
00:19:22,424 --> 00:19:29,742
Speaker 0: you know their their knees aren't as far forward So their weight most of their weight goes straight down onto their entire foot.

275
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,208
Speaker 1: It's kind of like they're sitting on their legs.

276
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:44,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Tried to do it, and I just couldn't get all my weight to go Evenly distribute it across both feet like it was either like on the insides of my feet or the Outsides or the front or the back on the heel.

277
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:46,041
Speaker 0: I couldn't get it.

278
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:52,470
Speaker 0: even so no matter what I did I was like gonna fall over in one direction or another or it hurt part of my foot.

279
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:54,469
Speaker 1: So you know I actually had no trouble doing it.

280
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,398
Speaker 1: I could just get down I could sit that way for a while,

281
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:56,859
Speaker 0: but

282
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:11,907
Speaker 1: for whatever reason when I sit like that it's uncomfortable because the muscles in my thigh and the muscles in my calf kind of grind up against each other and It feels like I'm crushing the muscles when I sit like that and it actually kind of hurts.

283
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:22,315
Speaker 1: Yes, so And then I realized I could do it if I shifted my legs to the left and right like outward But that just put all the stress on my knees instead.

284
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,260
Speaker 1: that was not a good idea.

285
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:24,319
Speaker 0: That's not a good idea at all.

286
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:33,529
Speaker 0: So it's like I did exactly what the video said trying different amounts of spreading my legs apart and trying different amounts different angles of foot positioning.

287
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,919
Speaker 0: and I don't know the the Western squat.

288
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:43,430
Speaker 0: while it does have the deficiencies that they state in the video It still works better for me than any of those Asian squats.

289
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:50,500
Speaker 1: Yeah I just remember Emily used to always tell me it like the the Yankees squat like the way Like you can see a punk punk kid in Japan.

290
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,066
Speaker 1: He's kind of squatting outside his store.

291
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:59,510
Speaker 1: They laugh about like yeah It's the Yankees squat Uh-huh, and it was it's kind of I remember she showed is the kind of different from the way they squatted.

292
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,549
Speaker 1: I'd show it to you right now, but I don't want to move the microphone or anything.

293
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,563
Speaker 0: Yes I want all the listeners watch this video and try to do the.

294
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:14,710
Speaker 0: if you're Asian try to do the Western squat And if you're not Asian try to do the Asian squat and give us feedback.

295
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,930
Speaker 1: We really want to know your thoughts feelings and experiences and we will talk about them next week.

296
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:23,990
Speaker 0: We might have to come up with some sort of combined super squat of sorts.

297
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:26,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, hey say we.

298
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:27,170
Speaker 1: if we do this, right?

299
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,910
Speaker 1: We might come up with the superior squat for the future generations of America and Japan.

300
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,966
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that the superior squat is number one.

301
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:39,090
Speaker 0: have a body Conducive to what the Asian squat and do the Asian squat properly.

302
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:40,269
Speaker 1: I don't know.

303
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:47,169
Speaker 1: Maybe that the actual answer is to become a great kungfu master and just sit like there's a chair there when there isn't a chair.

304
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,554
Speaker 0: That's also a good plan.

305
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:50,918
Speaker 1: Anyway, speaking of Emily.

306
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:55,010
Speaker 1: She sent me this video the other day and it's kind of the shaky cam.

307
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:16,471
Speaker 1: It looks like a guy's spying on two Japanese people - yeah - Japanese people eating in a restaurant and they're drinking wine they're using forks and knives and they're eating something and They go on to talk about how they've pulled a fast one over those thick Australians and the guy's like Yeah, so, you know this fish we get him to eat it raw What?

308
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:17,374
Speaker 1: no way.

309
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,478
Speaker 1: even better.

310
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,163
Speaker 1: We don't give him a fork and knife.

311
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:21,086
Speaker 1: What what do you give him?

312
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:22,330
Speaker 1: Just two sticks?

313
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,462
Speaker 1: We make him take their shoes off.

314
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:26,590
Speaker 1: we make him sit on the floor.

315
00:22:27,651 --> 00:22:33,330
Speaker 1: It's obviously something that was filmed like for one of those variety shows as a comedy bit, but it's kind of funny.

316
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:34,646
Speaker 1: What can I say?

317
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:39,870
Speaker 1: No, I mean, did you ever wonder if like say you have a friend who's from a country?

318
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,733
Speaker 1: You don't know much about?

319
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:44,570
Speaker 1: and they tell you like oh it's customary to do blah and blah might be a little weird.

320
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,844
Speaker 1: And maybe you wonder are they making this up?

321
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:47,830
Speaker 1: just to mess with me?

322
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:54,170
Speaker 1: In old country you spit in face for happiness and in old country you spit in face for luck?

323
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:56,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's quite an old joke.

324
00:22:56,078 --> 00:23:01,055
Speaker 0: and you always wonder like if you're going to another country It's always good to study the customs there.

325
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:05,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't or you go I recommend or if you don't use Wikipedia and only Wikipedia.

326
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:12,549
Speaker 0: Yeah We should go on Wikipedia and insert like a strange custom into every weird country, huh?

327
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:20,906
Speaker 1: Maybe in terms of the squat if you guys are telling us about squats Tell us about a weird thing that we should add to Wikipedia.

328
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,324
Speaker 1: granted I won't do it because I edit Wikipedia for good.

329
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:25,430
Speaker 1: This is all Scott.

330
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,342
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna do it either because mine won't be as funny as other people's.

331
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:34,641
Speaker 1: Well, maybe someone else should do it and Pick a country pick a weird custom.

332
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:36,550
Speaker 0: That's not true and add it to that country.

333
00:23:36,813 --> 00:23:38,190
Speaker 0: But make sure it's good be best.

334
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:43,670
Speaker 0: It was something that sounds true and maybe you have a little bit of evidence for so won't get deleted.

335
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:45,557
Speaker 1: Even better even better.

336
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:49,190
Speaker 1: do it and then in the forums on geek knives and front row crew calm.

337
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,717
Speaker 1: Put a link to the article.

338
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:58,405
Speaker 1: you put it in and see if anyone can pick out without cheating what you added Before it gets deleted by someone else.

339
00:23:58,626 --> 00:23:59,671
Speaker 1: if it does I mean the.

340
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:01,558
Speaker 1: I'll tell everyone a secret.

341
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:11,370
Speaker 1: the key to slipping bad stuff into Wikipedia is To do it to articles that people don't care about or to articles that don't have active dedicated maintainers.

342
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,950
Speaker 0: You've got to do this to the countries that no one cares about.

343
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:22,709
Speaker 1: The problem is a lot of cut small countries that are on there have like one guy from that country who watches it all the Time I was thinking more like Canada.

344
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:35,749
Speaker 1: You know I hear they play this game up there where they put metal blades on their feet and they run around on frozen ponds hitting a Big black rubber thing around with sticks.

345
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:36,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, sounds good.

346
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,919
Speaker 0: What kind of shit is that?

347
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,980
Speaker 0: Right maple leaves maple leaf leaves.

348
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:53,253
Speaker 1: so today is anime manga comics day and Last week we talked a bit about this and we also sent numerous emails to anime world order about it, but they have been Soliciting.

349
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:55,121
Speaker 0: just can't stop mentioning anime world order.

350
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:55,462
Speaker 0: Can you?

351
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:57,912
Speaker 1: well because I don't play promos anymore So I'm gonna.

352
00:24:57,952 --> 00:25:03,490
Speaker 1: I periodically mention the shows I listen to and also they're the sole reason we decided to do this series of shows.

353
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:12,970
Speaker 1: well, actually they were the first reason and then Unrelated to that a bunch of people in the forums and via email have been asking us about this topic a lot lately.

354
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:15,730
Speaker 1: So we figured we'd kill a whole bunch of birds with one stone.

355
00:25:16,272 --> 00:25:18,881
Speaker 1: If we if you asked us this question, and we didn't answer it yet.

356
00:25:19,383 --> 00:25:21,249
Speaker 1: That's because we're answering it right now.

357
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:37,222
Speaker 1: You see they were talking about how anime clubs are kind of obsolete or aren't doing well anymore and people don't want to go to anime clubs to watch anime and Just like showing rooms have become almost completely Unusable and no one cares about them and anime cons.

358
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:53,000
Speaker 0: so too if anime clubs fallen You see way back in the day way back there was anime and dinosaurs and dinosaurs But no one in the United States could get anime because most of them did not speak Japanese Especially the people who would have liked anime.

359
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,045
Speaker 0: they could not speak Japanese.

360
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:54,990
Speaker 0: There are mostly small children.

361
00:25:55,311 --> 00:26:08,226
Speaker 1: So the people who for whatever reason discovered this Japanese animation would get it somehow Usually difficulty raw and get groups of friends who also liked it and watch it.

362
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:11,738
Speaker 1: and the only way to see anime I mean there weren't even VCRs back then.

363
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:14,589
Speaker 1: you could only see anime by knowing someone who had it.

364
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:20,930
Speaker 1: So whoever had the most anime ran the local anime club and the anime club existed solely to show people anime.

365
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:25,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then came the VCR and the VCR made craziness happen.

366
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,631
Speaker 0: people You know They had.

367
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:32,790
Speaker 0: back in the day if you wanted a fan sub some guy somewhere would get laser discs from Japan.

368
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:36,410
Speaker 0: He would take his laser disc player and a machine called a genlock.

369
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,389
Speaker 0: I was wondering if you're gonna bring up the genlock genlock any good day and he would put subtitles using the genlock on to.

370
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,892
Speaker 0: He'd take the.

371
00:26:44,073 --> 00:26:52,984
Speaker 0: he took the laser disc and the genlock and a blank videotape and he would then Basically put subtitles on the laser disc video and it would go on to the tape.

372
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:57,108
Speaker 0: and if you sent him a blank tape He would copy that onto the tape for you.

373
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:05,410
Speaker 1: Yep, some people you could send them the cost of a tape and then they would mail you one just to save, you know Shipping costs and no one was charging money for it.

374
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:12,560
Speaker 0: They weren't like pirates trying to make money like some of the Hong Kong bootleggers are today, you know They were trying to give out the fan subs.

375
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,890
Speaker 1: I actually got a lot of anime that way.

376
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:19,790
Speaker 1: I remember from V kill V kll who back in the day was my favorite fan subber.

377
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:29,543
Speaker 1: I got all of Sailor Moon first generations from the mat from the laser disc VHS's and I got the end of Evangelion though.

378
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:31,550
Speaker 1: I didn't know that Evangelion was a show.

379
00:27:32,471 --> 00:27:36,824
Speaker 1: So I watched end of Ava like it was some movie and I remember thinking what the fuck is this?

380
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:38,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, what what?

381
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:39,771
Speaker 0: Why?

382
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:44,817
Speaker 1: so I showed it to everyone I knew and then I found out it was a show and they were all pissed at me For ruining it.

383
00:27:44,857 --> 00:27:50,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, either way I didn't even know you could do fan subs that way till I get to college and by then there was no Point in doing it.

384
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:58,342
Speaker 0: The point is before digital fan subs came which was about 2001 2002 they started really going.

385
00:27:58,362 --> 00:28:00,069
Speaker 0: they had him in 2000, but not so much.

386
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:02,809
Speaker 0: It was not easy to get anime.

387
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:07,610
Speaker 0: You could buy a very little bits of anime for lots of money in the store.

388
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:10,317
Speaker 0: You had to pay even more money if you wanted subtitles.

389
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:21,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously, it would be like 30 bucks for a dubbed VHS and 35 for a subbed VHS and that thing had between three and four episodes on it to a lot of times.

390
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:25,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe one movie was if you're lucky I mean early on.

391
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:26,558
Speaker 0: there's a lot mostly movies.

392
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:30,614
Speaker 0: just because it was so much money you if you're gonna pay that much you were Gonna get a whole movie.

393
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:32,604
Speaker 0: then it moved on to the TV shows.

394
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:41,208
Speaker 1: later when the prices started to go I bought the original Tenchi OAV disc for disc over the course of like seven months because I couldn't afford it.

395
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:54,649
Speaker 0: Well Anyway Because of all that situation we had to have an anime club which is a place where people got together and combined their anime so that People could see more anime than they could afford.

396
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:56,830
Speaker 0: I mean sci-fi channel was alright.

397
00:28:57,053 --> 00:29:04,730
Speaker 0: But eventually, you know They weren't consistent enough to really serve your anime needs and they only showed a very limited amount of stuff and blockbuster was alright.

398
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,078
Speaker 0: But they only had a limited amount of stuff.

399
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all blockbusters seem to have the same things.

400
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:20,989
Speaker 1: They all had like Armageddon wind of amnesia random stuff from Ava Do Megalopolis Vampire hunter d lotus war in the heroic legend of ours if it was on sci-fi channel is usually a blockbuster.

401
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:25,484
Speaker 1: Yep I remember I rented tank police a multiple times just cuz I couldn't find here.

402
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:26,086
Speaker 0: They had Akira.

403
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:29,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, they always had Akira Yep, and that was the way of things.

404
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:35,210
Speaker 1: So anime clubs pretty much just existed to show people anime and to popularize anime.

405
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:46,145
Speaker 1: Yes, like the the stated goal of many anime clubs or Japanese film cultural Whatever societies was to promote the acceptance and love of anime in North America.

406
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:52,150
Speaker 0: and mission accomplished Yep, they was accomplished a long time ago, but no one had a party.

407
00:29:52,371 --> 00:30:02,329
Speaker 0: Where was this party when they you know, it's very rare to see like someone, you know trying to do something intentionally Accomplished the goal and then not be like we?

408
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:07,650
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it was that it was kind of a slippery slope, I mean things came in gradually.

409
00:30:08,115 --> 00:30:14,638
Speaker 1: It wasn't like one day Watching Akira in your basement was you were a loser and the next day Watching Akira in your basement with your friends.

410
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:15,321
Speaker 1: You were a winner.

411
00:30:15,622 --> 00:30:25,840
Speaker 1: It was just kind of this gradual Boom of anime and it seemed to really culminated the whole Ava, Eska Bebop kind of era when anime really started getting crazy.

412
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:28,870
Speaker 1: Yep, at least in terms of adding new fans.

413
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:33,010
Speaker 0: So you had these anime clubs and they had succeeded in their goal.

414
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:35,678
Speaker 0: It was now easy for everyone to get anime.

415
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,343
Speaker 0: You could buy plenty of anime.

416
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:39,269
Speaker 0: You didn't need to go to club to get it.

417
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,619
Speaker 0: There were plenty of anime fans.

418
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,130
Speaker 0: anime animes on TV was on Cartoon Network.

419
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,577
Speaker 0: You could buy it in the store.

420
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:51,585
Speaker 0: media play had a giant anime section before it went out of business And it didn't go out of business because of its anime section either.

421
00:30:51,706 --> 00:31:00,830
Speaker 1: now at this point Anime clubs seemed to diverged over time into three kind of distinct bodies As as anime fandom kind of changed.

422
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:08,313
Speaker 1: I mean on one hand you had the clubs that stayed the same and they just they showed anime and their primary focus was to show Anime to people.

423
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:23,830
Speaker 1: but because you could get all mainstream anime easily The way the club survived and still made people come to their showings was to show the stuff You couldn't get the stuff that wasn't released in the US the fan sub that your friend made the weird Asian movie.

424
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,714
Speaker 1: That was never.

425
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:28,429
Speaker 1: no one's even heard of that you got because a friend of yours taped it off Japanese TV.

426
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,650
Speaker 0: The really old but really cool show.

427
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:37,685
Speaker 0: I know there's a. there's this club of really old anime guys and They always show up at the club summit at Otakon like a few of them.

428
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:38,550
Speaker 1: They're awesome guys.

429
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:39,198
Speaker 1: We talked to him ever.

430
00:31:39,218 --> 00:31:40,251
Speaker 0: there are awesome guys Like.

431
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:44,229
Speaker 0: I've seen them there for like three or four years in a row But I never actually talked to them that much.

432
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:50,130
Speaker 0: But I know that they're these old guys and they have an anime club and they just watch ancient anime wicked ancient.

433
00:31:50,210 --> 00:32:00,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you want to know how think this air of eight man after was an animated movie that I saw a long long time ago and I really liked and it's kind of old school for someone like me.

434
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:07,490
Speaker 1: they Considered eight man after to be the newest of new school because they used to be fans of eight man.

435
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:14,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, Tobor the eighth man Tobor Robot get it and that's one of the newer anime that those guys watch.

436
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:16,938
Speaker 1: But they're awesome dudes.

437
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,587
Speaker 1: I mean they they have kept it real.

438
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:19,129
Speaker 0: Yeah.

439
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:23,226
Speaker 0: So now you have this problem is that people like their anime clubs.

440
00:32:23,267 --> 00:32:23,950
Speaker 0: they have clubs.

441
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,770
Speaker 0: They want to keep these clubs because they're fun, but people aren't going to the clubs because there's no need.

442
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:33,470
Speaker 1: Well, I said the three kind like the three ways clubs diverged at this point and they all stayed successful.

443
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:37,703
Speaker 1: I mean the second way was some clubs moved into running conventions instead of having clubs.

444
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:49,462
Speaker 1: and the third way the way we're gonna talk About today mostly was the clubs that transformed into social clubs that were centered around As opposed to anime clubs that included social elements.

445
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:51,650
Speaker 0: Well, there are the clubs that refuse to transform.

446
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:53,477
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, but they died back then.

447
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:57,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, or some of them are still around and but they they're still dying.

448
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:05,050
Speaker 1: Yeah Though I'd say that most of those clubs Transformed into the first kind the ones that survived by showing the stuff people couldn't get and that was fine.

449
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:06,474
Speaker 1: They still serve that purpose.

450
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:18,650
Speaker 1: then came fan subs on the internet followed by YouTube and Google video Followed by bit torrent followed by huge conventions followed by DVDs in the stores followed by deep discount DVD followed by pod.

451
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,796
Speaker 1: I mean now there's nothing obscure.

452
00:33:21,237 --> 00:33:24,566
Speaker 1: if something exists in Japan and anyone finds it amusing.

453
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:29,379
Speaker 1: It's on the internet Immediately and everyone downloads it and watches it.

454
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,952
Speaker 1: and if you go to a con and they try to show it have the audience says What.

455
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:33,959
Speaker 1: I saw that a month ago.

456
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:34,965
Speaker 1: What the fuck's wrong with you.

457
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:41,866
Speaker 1: Yep All right, so now that first kind of club is in the same situation they were when anime exploded.

458
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,510
Speaker 1: they're losing members.

459
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,430
Speaker 1: No one comes to their showings anymore.

460
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:49,069
Speaker 1: they don't know why they think that people don't want to come to showings anymore.

461
00:33:49,089 --> 00:34:02,544
Speaker 1: and We're gonna do a whole series from this point on Various weeks on how anime clubs have to be run to be successful how to run an anime club I maintain an anime club how to start an anime club how to promote anime.

462
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:04,170
Speaker 1: all that stuff all rolled into one.

463
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:09,145
Speaker 0: But the first thing is because the old goal of anime clubs has been accomplished.

464
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,914
Speaker 0: if you have an anime club now What's the goal?

465
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:16,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's something you really have to think about because there's no clear answer anymore.

466
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:18,940
Speaker 1: There's no right answer anymore.

467
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,710
Speaker 0: There wasn't a right answer to begin with.

468
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,158
Speaker 1: Well back there really was a thing.

469
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:24,389
Speaker 0: is everyone else came up with the same answer independently.

470
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:30,630
Speaker 1: Well back then there really wasn't an answer other than to promote anime or possibly to enjoy anime itself.

471
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,980
Speaker 1: It was just at something something anime or anime something.

472
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:34,481
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

473
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:39,195
Speaker 1: Now you can have all sorts of goals and Before we get any further.

474
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:42,289
Speaker 1: I do want to point out that I know what anime world orders.

475
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:50,909
Speaker 1: first thing They're gonna say is yeah clubs that changed are popular but the old clubs are dying and that sucks because clubs don't show anything anymore.

476
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:56,510
Speaker 1: and I think today's example see we're not going to talk about the specific logistics yet of running club.

477
00:34:56,951 --> 00:35:03,470
Speaker 1: We need to Skype in a whole bunch of different people that we know including the legendary Scott Johnson about all legendary.

478
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:04,655
Speaker 1: Well, he's legendary.

479
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:07,948
Speaker 0: I'll dig I'll try to turn it only according to new type magazine.

480
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:08,510
Speaker 0: That's fine.

481
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just love type USA.

482
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:17,690
Speaker 1: It says Scott Johnson legendary anime club expert, but then it shows a picture of me in the front of the audience talking.

483
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:19,773
Speaker 0: Yep I felt so.

484
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:31,853
Speaker 1: I only felt bad because that happened to him at anime central years and years and years ago Where someone made a video of us doing some event in a room party and the subtitle said Scott Johnson But it was me.

485
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:35,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it showed me and it said Scott.

486
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:50,223
Speaker 1: Anyway What we're gonna start with today is an example of pretty much the most successful Anime club in the United States and probably in North America the RIT anime club.

487
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:51,467
Speaker 1: and before you get.

488
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:57,717
Speaker 1: but I'll just say right now Their primary thing is still to this day Straight-up showings of anime.

489
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:04,539
Speaker 1: they show anime in a room and they still get over a hundred people Minimum at every single showing they do every single week.

490
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know enough about what they do now because I haven't been there in years.

491
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:14,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, well luckily I can talk a lot about what we were doing a couple years ago and a couple years ago The situation really hasn't changed much.

492
00:36:14,836 --> 00:36:16,180
Speaker 0: fan subs are still everywhere.

493
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,010
Speaker 0: You know, it really isn't that much different from doing it right now.

494
00:36:19,331 --> 00:36:23,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in fact that the real because the club was originally I mean the club is a very old club.

495
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:36,549
Speaker 1: the club was founded long before I knew what RIT was or what anime was or anything and it was originally the same kind of Anime club that every other anime club was and they transformed into a different kind of club

496
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:37,654
Speaker 0: Way

497
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:46,630
Speaker 1: ahead of the curve way before anyone even thought there would be a problem and as a result They've almost always been very large very popular and very well run.

498
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:53,850
Speaker 1: But don't forget don't argue that they're a different kind of club and that that's bad because they still show anime straight up.

499
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,457
Speaker 1: That's their primary thing.

500
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,950
Speaker 1: In fact, they show anime like three times a week Yes, and they get as many people at those things they do as all the other things.

501
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, part of the advantage is being at RIT, which is basically sitting in a pile of nerds.

502
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:08,756
Speaker 1: Yeah Look at RIT.

503
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:09,940
Speaker 1: They have an anime club.

504
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:11,646
Speaker 1: They have a Japanese culture club.

505
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,550
Speaker 1: that's separate from that.

506
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,659
Speaker 0: They used to have two anime clubs a long time ago.

507
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,327
Speaker 1: Yeah competing they have a gaming club.

508
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:19,410
Speaker 1: separate from that.

509
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,360
Speaker 1: They have the go club the chess club.

510
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:26,342
Speaker 1: I think there's a shogi club now What I don't know if it came to be but I know people were trying to start it.

511
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:26,723
Speaker 0: Wow.

512
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:31,349
Speaker 1: and a video gaming club That was separate from the other gaming club.

513
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:37,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, those video gaming and then gaming gaming and then chess and all that and all these other separate clubs.

514
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,729
Speaker 1: I mean there are a lot of geeks at RIT.

515
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:46,068
Speaker 1: So but the thing is other anime clubs in the upstate New York area are.

516
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:47,234
Speaker 1: They're not.

517
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:53,170
Speaker 1: I mean, they're obviously not as gigantic as this club But they're still doing very well and they're growing or at least staying the same.

518
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,030
Speaker 1: They're not shrinking like a lot of the clubs people have been talking about in the rest of the country.

519
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I went to Cinecon right and there weren't too many people at Cinecon But they're all.

520
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:14,531
Speaker 0: Cita is the SUNY IT anime club and they ran the con and it seemed like they had a whole bunch of nerds from SUNY IT and also the nearby community college that were in their club and they were all the staff of the con and there was at least 30 of those people.

521
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:27,970
Speaker 1: it really seems that a lot of the anime clubs at least up where we are and in this whole area are doing very well and While they may not be huge that's more a function of where they are as opposed to how well they're wrong.

522
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:38,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like if a club is run Well, it will continue to exist and do things and if a club is run poorly It will die and disappear and the number of people that are actually in the club is dependent on the location of the club.

523
00:38:39,371 --> 00:39:02,530
Speaker 1: So what what we'll do today is we really just want to go over exactly what the RIT anime club did and How they did it and some of the reasons behind why and then in the upcoming episodes on this we're gonna talk a lot about The specifics like how to run this kind of an event how to promote a club how to start a club how to end a club Why you might want to end a club.

524
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,663
Speaker 1: But anyway, sometimes you do the RIT anime club.

525
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:21,516
Speaker 1: when we came to power You see when we were freshmen at RIT the club was already gigantic and their original format at that time as it had been for Ages and ages was very simple every Thursday night They would have a meeting a main meeting.

526
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:24,484
Speaker 1: the majority of the active members would come to this meeting.

527
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:29,590
Speaker 1: in addition periodically on Weekends, they would have anime marathons.

528
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,530
Speaker 1: They would pick an anime and show the whole thing all the way through as a one-time event like a Saturday Sunday or Friday Saturday.

529
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:40,490
Speaker 1: They would have quarterly social nights which are basically a small convention.

530
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,972
Speaker 1: I mean anime RIT anime social nights are seriously larger than some anime cons I've been to.

531
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,800
Speaker 0: yeah, basically what they did at the social nights.

532
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,784
Speaker 0: They get a few rooms.

533
00:39:48,844 --> 00:40:00,662
Speaker 0: They set up some video games they set up a VCR and they showed some anime on it with a projector and You know, maybe a little DDR tournament Maybe something like that and then a table full of manga to read a

534
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:02,307
Speaker 1: trash talk Mario tennis tournament

535
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:03,070
Speaker 0: and that was that.

536
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:06,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe a lot of people showed up and hung out all night having fun.

537
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:17,510
Speaker 1: Yeah They would also periodically and these came and went depending how much money there was have anime dance nights with live DJs Anime and Japanese techno and dance music and crazy parties.

538
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:22,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did that and then they didn't do it and then they did it again and it was sort of an on-and-off thing.

539
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:29,901
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean that that sort of thing requires a lot of resources that aren't just human resources So they're kind of hard to pull off from even large clubs.

540
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:40,950
Speaker 0: Yep, unless you want to do them shoddily Yeah, you could do anything shoddily Yeah, and if people don't know good from bad Like if they don't know good piano playing from rims piano playing then get away with shoddy.

541
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:46,670
Speaker 1: Now they also had club days where they would sit somewhere prominent on campus and just promote themselves.

542
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,189
Speaker 1: And you know explain what anime was to people who didn't know and a surprising number of people didn't know.

543
00:40:51,991 --> 00:41:04,712
Speaker 0: It was scary like they would put up posters all over the school full of nerds and they would send emails to everyone in the Whole-school almost who cared and they did all this stuff to say hey come to the goddamn anime Club if you like anime and You know what?

544
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:07,044
Speaker 0: There are still people who liked anime.

545
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:15,530
Speaker 0: went to RIT Multiple years went to classes there for multiple years and somehow did not know that the anime Club existed despite it being huge.

546
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,857
Speaker 1: They walk past anime club fire.

547
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,462
Speaker 1: They'd come to us and say holy shit.

548
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:20,345
Speaker 1: There's an anime Club.

549
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, where can I join?

550
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,126
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah Now there were all other one-off events.

551
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:30,040
Speaker 1: like a couple times We rented a local movie theater and showed anime in that.

552
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:31,124
Speaker 0: well, we got the.

553
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,150
Speaker 0: the local art theater showed spirited away.

554
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:34,425
Speaker 0: So we just bought all the tickets.

555
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:38,344
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, we kind of we kind of have convinced them to show it like.

556
00:41:38,384 --> 00:41:47,216
Speaker 1: we talked to them a lot about it And then they agreed they'll show it and then we would buy all the tickets and then the anime the whole anime Club went and watched The movie in the theater.

557
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:57,850
Speaker 1: Yep, along with a bunch of other people from the area And there were all a whole bunch of other random events that we can kind of talk about You know like anime dodgeball events and a whole bunch of one-off things.

558
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:05,801
Speaker 1: But the core is as we have already said now that there's Thursday showings The main showings were structured in a very specific way.

559
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:08,730
Speaker 1: that seems very conducive to having a popular anime Club.

560
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:13,490
Speaker 0: The first thing they did is they stood up in front of the club and they announced the club business.

561
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:16,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you got to have some kind of a ritual a shtick.

562
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:17,910
Speaker 1: people really like that sort of thing.

563
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:24,190
Speaker 1: So every time someone would walk up to the front of the room, you know The crowd would gather people would show up an hour before the club meeting and just hang out.

564
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,690
Speaker 0: But it's like if you had no class before the club you had nothing else to do.

565
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,969
Speaker 0: You might as well come and hang out.

566
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,589
Speaker 0: There's gonna be at least one other person there.

567
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:35,999
Speaker 1: But people would shuffle in the new room be very loud and when it was time to start The president of the club would get up and yell.

568
00:42:36,461 --> 00:42:37,405
Speaker 1: Hi everybody.

569
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:40,378
Speaker 1: Hi, dr Nick and that was kind of the cue.

570
00:42:40,398 --> 00:42:42,347
Speaker 1: and then the whole club would shut up and yell back.

571
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:48,895
Speaker 1: Hi Rim or hi Luke or hi, whoever's president Mmm, and everyone would get quiet.

572
00:42:49,357 --> 00:43:01,789
Speaker 1: and then the people on the board whoever was running the club at the time would give all sorts of announcements and They kind of do all like not really a stand-up act But they'd be very humorous in the front of the room in a very calculated way.

573
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:16,110
Speaker 1: engage the crowd talk to the crowd yell at the crowd get the crowd to yell back get everyone really worked up and You think that sounds cheesy But it worked without fail every week on the same people for years and years and years.

574
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:17,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's quite amazing.

575
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:20,570
Speaker 1: It was so easy to get an anime crowd pumped up.

576
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:28,370
Speaker 1: I mean literally if like if I'm at a croc con and I need to do crowd control Just yell the name of an anime and that'll shut everyone up and then they'll yell back.

577
00:43:28,811 --> 00:43:30,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, it it's people are.

578
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:40,849
Speaker 0: if people are such a fan of something you can just yell out Almost anything related to that fandom and you'll get their attention and you know, they'll start really getting into it now.

579
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:42,341
Speaker 1: in addition I mean we do announcements.

580
00:43:42,362 --> 00:43:42,928
Speaker 1: what's coming up?

581
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,792
Speaker 1: We do the funny stuff we'd and then we would talk about what we were going to show that day give a little bit of insight Into it.

582
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:52,910
Speaker 1: maybe like well, this is a famous anime blah or this is a secret.

583
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,078
Speaker 1: We can't tell you what it is because that'll ruin the surprise.

584
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:57,889
Speaker 1: or this was so-and-so's last work.

585
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:59,969
Speaker 1: Yep, a little bit of education there.

586
00:44:00,251 --> 00:44:03,789
Speaker 1: It also again engages them gives them a reason to show up even if they don't want to see the show.

587
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,924
Speaker 1: Then we would have a raffle.

588
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:11,010
Speaker 1: now We're not going to talk about the format of the raffle because that would require time.

589
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:17,517
Speaker 1: But suffice to say the RIT anime Club came up with a very unique Method of holding raffles at club meetings.

590
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:21,590
Speaker 1: that is extremely conducive to getting people to show up to the meetings.

591
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:28,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, people would get a raffle ticket and the raffle ticket that they had could get them a prize But only if they showed up.

592
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:32,330
Speaker 0: therefore they would show up to pretty much every meeting where there was gonna be a raffle.

593
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:37,230
Speaker 0: Even if they weren't gonna watch the show they would show up to your meeting and they might stick around.

594
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,736
Speaker 0: You know, they're not gonna come.

595
00:44:38,796 --> 00:44:40,262
Speaker 0: just do the raffle and leave.

596
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:43,716
Speaker 0: they're gonna come watch a little bit And then if they don't like it, they're gonna leave.

597
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:47,190
Speaker 1: Yep, then we would show the anime music videos.

598
00:44:47,572 --> 00:44:55,766
Speaker 1: See we had people in the club on the board whose only job Was to find good anime music videos that we hadn't shown before every week every single week.

599
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:57,130
Speaker 0: That's 30 weeks a year.

600
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,405
Speaker 0: You need to find three or four good music videos.

601
00:44:59,485 --> 00:45:04,890
Speaker 1: not easy But it worked really well because people would come even if they didn't want to watch the show.

602
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:14,930
Speaker 1: they would come for the announcements and all that and they'd come to see the anime music videos because it is almost Impossible to find the good anime music videos on your own without someone else telling you where to look.

603
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:19,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could go out and get the music videos yourself off the internet.

604
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:20,510
Speaker 0: That's not difficult.

605
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:24,419
Speaker 0: And you know The thing is to know which ones are good.

606
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:27,949
Speaker 0: to act as a filter is like this service that does not exist.

607
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,595
Speaker 0: you go Music videos org.

608
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:32,385
Speaker 0: It's not easy to pick out the good from the bad.

609
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:33,870
Speaker 0: It's actually quite difficult.

610
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:42,676
Speaker 0: They're we have YouTube now But even then it's really hard to pick out the good from the bad and a lot of times like you'll know a good video Because it won an award at a convention.

611
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:45,045
Speaker 0: You can't find the place to download it on the internet.

612
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,390
Speaker 0: It's just not it's nowhere.

613
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:53,399
Speaker 0: Yep, and if the anime club, you know provides all the best videos every week on the screen It gets people to come.

614
00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:04,162
Speaker 0: it gets people all hyped up Especially if the video is humorous and a lot of people even if they've seen the show Even if there isn't a raffle will come watch the music videos.

615
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:18,510
Speaker 1: and also there's the whole and we'll talk about this a lot Through the whole series the crowd dynamic people who came to the club had realized partly due to marketing and partly on their own That watching these things with a group of people is almost always more fulfilling than watching it alone.

616
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:20,121
Speaker 1: I mean a good AMV.

617
00:46:20,162 --> 00:46:22,053
Speaker 1: if you watched it in your room you go Wow, that was good.

618
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:28,454
Speaker 1: If you watch it with a crowd of people if it's a sad AMV, you'll get that collective At the end.

619
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:33,269
Speaker 1: or if it's an action AMV, you'll get people yelling and screaming at the end and people really get into it.

620
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:37,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of shows that just don't work out.

621
00:46:37,281 --> 00:46:43,095
Speaker 0: if you watch them alone like Excel saga watching Excel saga alone You know, it's just kind of like oh my god There's something crazy going on the screen.

622
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:49,049
Speaker 0: it hurts but you watch it with a crowd of people and it's like oh There's you know, it just changes the whole thing.

623
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:55,070
Speaker 1: So then now this is probably the most important part and this is the thing that a lot of clubs seem to get wrong.

624
00:46:55,611 --> 00:47:12,529
Speaker 1: And I say wrong because every club that is adopted the RIT anime club method of show a picking what to show and showing it Has done better than if they'd done it the old way and very few clubs that follow this format Well have failed as far as I'm aware Because most clubs don't seem to do it this way.

625
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:14,986
Speaker 1: A lot of clubs will show an anime all the way through.

626
00:47:15,007 --> 00:47:17,979
Speaker 1: like every week They show the next X episodes of why show?

627
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,588
Speaker 0: so week one they show episodes one two and three.

628
00:47:20,668 --> 00:47:23,056
Speaker 0: week two They show episodes four five and six.

629
00:47:23,117 --> 00:47:23,879
Speaker 0: week three.

630
00:47:23,939 --> 00:47:25,284
Speaker 0: They show episode seven eight nine.

631
00:47:25,424 --> 00:47:27,930
Speaker 1: We'll talk about this in more detail Yeah in the future.

632
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,953
Speaker 0: But some bad idea.

633
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:34,210
Speaker 0: some clubs like will show three or four shows and they'll show like episode one and two of three different shows.

634
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,682
Speaker 0: And the next week they'll show episode three and four of the same three shows.

635
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:40,940
Speaker 1: again now RIT anime did that But they didn't do it.

636
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,085
Speaker 1: on their main Thursday shows They had a whole separate track of showings on Monday night.

637
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:46,090
Speaker 0: that didn't come till later.

638
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,800
Speaker 1: Yes, and it was a good success and it's still going to this day.

639
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:56,688
Speaker 1: Wow and but yeah on the Monday shows they would pick two or three shows and show them all the way through a couple episodes of each every week.

640
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,068
Speaker 1: and Actually a whole different crowd shows up to that kind of showings.

641
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:10,624
Speaker 1: but the Thursday showings they would show either four episodes of a new show as in the first four episodes or One episode of a bunch of different shows.

642
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:18,357
Speaker 0: rarely like a sample That was usually on the first meeting of the whole year is they would show the first episodes of like four different shows and four Different genres.

643
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:19,830
Speaker 0: Yeah to kind of you know.

644
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,938
Speaker 0: So here's a look at all these different anime.

645
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,143
Speaker 0: one of these has to interest you.

646
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:26,676
Speaker 1: or if we were doing a theme day like Tonight is violence night.

647
00:48:26,716 --> 00:48:29,064
Speaker 1: Here's the poor violent anime.

648
00:48:29,185 --> 00:48:36,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, or one movie Yep Now this worked very well because one we'd promote what show we were going to show.

649
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:39,520
Speaker 1: Two people who wanted to see that show would come and see it.

650
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:51,766
Speaker 1: people who didn't want to see that show would come anyway for all the other stuff at the start of the club and then a Lot of them would end up sticking around anyway because they realize oh I kind of do want to watch the show.

651
00:48:51,907 --> 00:49:00,015
Speaker 1: or maybe Like initial D is the best example initial D. If you don't know what it is and then you see it or hear about it It sounds so stupid.

652
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:03,430
Speaker 0: I actually watched the first four episodes and thought it was stupid.

653
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:11,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it worked because no one wanted to watch this show and everyone thought the club was stupid for showing it But they stayed and watched the first four episodes.

654
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:18,138
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know 130 people are in the room watching initial D and they all walk out like yeah I don't know what I think about that.

655
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,150
Speaker 1: and then a lot of them showed up to the marathon.

656
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,240
Speaker 1: I'm a few months later.

657
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,480
Speaker 0: when I watched the marathon Months later.

658
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,596
Speaker 0: I was like, ah shit But why do I have to like this show?

659
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:30,970
Speaker 1: because the club shows a different show or a different movie every week one.

660
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,828
Speaker 1: You don't lose people who miss one week and can't catch up.

661
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:39,770
Speaker 1: Instead you get people who come every week because maybe they don't know about a lot of these shows.

662
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:52,469
Speaker 1: We took great pains to pick Very specifically the shows we wanted to show to one draw people in and then to especially later in the year to expose people to Anime, we know they'll probably like but they would never seek out on their own.

663
00:49:53,112 --> 00:49:59,652
Speaker 1: So we showed a lot of weird stuff a lot of old stuff a lot of things that people would never dream of watching on Their own.

664
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:02,410
Speaker 1: but they trusted us because they knew the club was good.

665
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,530
Speaker 1: So they'd come they'd watch this show and if they really didn't like it they'd leave.

666
00:50:06,932 --> 00:50:17,126
Speaker 1: but most of the time people would get a kick out of it and Hundreds and hundreds of people would come to us all the time and tell us wow I never thought I would have liked Excel saga, but that show was hilarious.

667
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:17,950
Speaker 0: Thanks for showing it.

668
00:50:18,111 --> 00:50:20,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know a lot of clubs especially high school clubs.

669
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:25,910
Speaker 0: They say they have this problem where you know, the members all they want to do is watch Naruto and Dragon Ball.

670
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:30,190
Speaker 0: they don't want to watch any of this other stuff, you know, and They keep incoming and complaining.

671
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:36,369
Speaker 0: The problem is is you have this sort of assumption already that the members somehow decide what the showing is gonna be?

672
00:50:36,851 --> 00:50:38,000
Speaker 0: the RIT anime club?

673
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,093
Speaker 0: that was never even Thought of that.

674
00:50:40,113 --> 00:50:44,530
Speaker 0: that could be a possibility that someone else decides what to show besides the people who run the club.

675
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hate to say it but autocracy worked a lot better than democracy.

676
00:50:49,011 --> 00:51:00,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, now part of the reason is that the people who know good anime or old anime fans They know what they like They know what they don't like and they're usually a lot more open-minded about trying something so you don't need to worry about them.

677
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:06,110
Speaker 1: The young Naruto one-piece Dragon Ball fanboys who haven't been exposed to a lot of anime.

678
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:09,612
Speaker 1: Don't know that there's a lot of stuff out there They'll like.

679
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:19,642
Speaker 1: but because if you have things to get them to come to club other than just the showing like the raffles The anime music videos the funny announcements the social events the tape check out.

680
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:20,545
Speaker 1: I'll get to that.

681
00:51:20,565 --> 00:51:24,590
Speaker 1: then they'll come They'll watch the show anyway, or at least give it a try.

682
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:31,610
Speaker 1: They'll probably like it and you have just created a more mature more widespread in interest anime fan.

683
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:32,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, you must decide.

684
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,623
Speaker 0: this is the show we're showing.

685
00:51:34,864 --> 00:51:41,990
Speaker 0: end of story, you know It shouldn't even be possible for anyone else to decide what the show is gonna be besides the board or the people running the club.

686
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:48,539
Speaker 1: We'll talk a lot about how to pick shows because that was the primary duty of the board Was to pick the show for each week.

687
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:54,570
Speaker 1: We very carefully crafted it to Balance between drawing people in and exposing people to new things.

688
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:59,230
Speaker 0: Yeah And don't worry like if there might be some people who only show up when you're showing a robot show.

689
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:03,590
Speaker 0: There might be some people who will show up and then leave as soon as the show starts.

690
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,956
Speaker 1: That's the sign of a healthy club.

691
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:05,638
Speaker 0: That's fine.

692
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:12,089
Speaker 0: You know, people are coming people are going, you know As long as you get people to show up they don't have to sit there the whole time.

693
00:52:12,371 --> 00:52:21,533
Speaker 1: I mean one night we'd get you know 180 people because we're showing like the cowboy bebop movie and everyone's excited about it and a lot of people come even people who don't Normally ever come.

694
00:52:21,994 --> 00:52:25,787
Speaker 1: and then the next week we show I don't know big O and we only get 120 people.

695
00:52:27,052 --> 00:52:34,023
Speaker 1: But 40 of those people are people who didn't come to the cowboy bebop showing Mm-hmm, or that not the cowboy be the cowboy movie showing.

696
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:34,264
Speaker 1: Yeah.

697
00:52:34,606 --> 00:52:43,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then the next week We show Sailor Moon and 160 people show up But 20 of them have never even come to anime club before and 40 of them came to cowboy bebop But didn't want to see big O.

698
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:45,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's crazy.

699
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:53,130
Speaker 0: So people would come and go as they please and and of course There's always like the 50 people who show up no matter what and we'll watch the whole thing no matter what and they're always there.

700
00:52:53,420 --> 00:53:01,923
Speaker 1: Yep in fact one time we tried to show the worst crap we could to get people to leave just as an Experiment and they wouldn't leave and they watched it anyway, and they cheered.

701
00:53:01,943 --> 00:53:02,505
Speaker 1: Yep.

702
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:04,655
Speaker 1: See the other benefit I don't.

703
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:05,500
Speaker 1: we're already going long.

704
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,210
Speaker 1: So we'll have to save this for future episodes.

705
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:11,002
Speaker 1: All right, even bad anime is good in a crowd.

706
00:53:11,182 --> 00:53:12,065
Speaker 0: Well some bad.

707
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:15,726
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah some anime is Unsalvageable like gray the digital target.

708
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:30,910
Speaker 1: Yes But if you think if you pick the wrong show and the show is not good and the crowd doesn't like it They'll stay anyway And they'll probably have a lot of fun yelling at the screen making fun of it talking about how shitty it is and then leave Having just as much fun as if they'd watched a Miyazaki masterpiece.

709
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:37,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean when we first went to the club before we were in charge of it at all They would always yell at people who made any sort of noise during the showing.

710
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:42,863
Speaker 0: and you know Generally, you don't want people making noise during the showing if they're whispering or anything.

711
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:43,706
Speaker 0: It's been knowing.

712
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:45,030
Speaker 0: it's like it's like a movie theater.

713
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:59,307
Speaker 0: You don't want people going blabbity-blah interrupting other people watching but at the same time if people have witty and hilarious things to yell out or They want to laugh real loud or you know point out something or anything like that.

714
00:53:59,788 --> 00:54:00,631
Speaker 0: Go for it You got it.

715
00:54:00,692 --> 00:54:04,546
Speaker 0: Like, you know, you don't want to just shut people up, which is what they did originally.

716
00:54:04,747 --> 00:54:10,916
Speaker 0: you want to Encourage one sort of not shutting up while encouraging Shutting up at the appropriate times

717
00:54:11,177 --> 00:54:24,300
Speaker 1: and we will talk about that also in great detail because while there is no hard and fast rule I think we can lay out a fairly specific set of guidelines that if you follow them in terms of enforcing quiet rules Your club will do better almost overnight.

718
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:24,862
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

719
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:33,867
Speaker 1: And then after the showing Afterward in the anime club office we would have tape check out which we'll have to talk about that as a whole episode.

720
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:37,930
Speaker 1: because yeah the Landscape of tape check out and anime libraries is changing.

721
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,423
Speaker 1: But before fan subs were really widespread on the internet.

722
00:54:41,443 --> 00:54:47,201
Speaker 1: All right, the anime had always had a gigantic gigantic library of tapes that members could check out.

723
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:48,966
Speaker 1: and then we expanded that.

724
00:54:49,006 --> 00:55:00,584
Speaker 1: in fact Scott Johnson are the President before me when he was librarian and the even when he was president is Known, you know kind of like in the roles of history as the president who Expanded the library.

725
00:55:00,704 --> 00:55:01,346
Speaker 1: amazingly.

726
00:55:01,386 --> 00:55:03,231
Speaker 1: He made the library gigantic.

727
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:04,816
Speaker 1: He switched us to DVDs.

728
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:06,300
Speaker 1: We got rid of old fan subs.

729
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,359
Speaker 1: It was kind of this reformation of the anime club library, which made it even more popular.

730
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:22,359
Speaker 1: the library existed one to give people access to old anime that they couldn't get otherwise which now isn't as much of an issue and To it got people to stay around even if they didn't want to watch the show.

731
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:24,880
Speaker 1: They'd show up in the beginning because they wanted the and these.

732
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:29,580
Speaker 1: They'd show up at the end for tape check out and to hang out in the social area during tape check out.

733
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:31,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing is that people didn't like to show.

734
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:35,438
Speaker 0: often They would just go directly to the tape check out even if they couldn't get the tapes.

735
00:55:35,518 --> 00:55:42,031
Speaker 0: yet They would sit around and talk to each other about Anime or whatever because you have all these people with a common interest.

736
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:46,325
Speaker 0: if they're going to a club and they could get the anime On their own what are they there for?

737
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:51,200
Speaker 0: they're there for some sort of social interaction or to get a raffle prize or something.

738
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:52,868
Speaker 0: Usually the social interaction.

739
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:58,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if they don't want to watch the show They're gonna want to have someplace to go during the show.

740
00:55:58,581 --> 00:55:59,625
Speaker 0: You just hang out and talk.

741
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,920
Speaker 0: I could talk about when he had the social room, but I'm not gonna waste time.

742
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:11,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, what we'll do is we're basically gonna break up each of the topics that we brought up today Episode per episode skyping in relevant experts.

743
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:16,779
Speaker 1: We know when they're appropriate and we'll tell you exactly how to do all of these things.

744
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:21,659
Speaker 1: But all we really did today was overview how the RIT anime club ran its main showings.

745
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:32,939
Speaker 1: and Even if you don't listen to any more of our episodes on how to run anime clubs All I can say is that if you try to model your club after the basic idea of what RIT anime does I?

746
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,399
Speaker 1: guarantee your club will be more successful than it has been in the past.

747
00:56:37,419 --> 00:56:50,981
Speaker 1: and If you think that anime clubs are dying or changing to the point that they're not fun anymore If you live anywhere in upstate New York go to the Rochester Institute of Technology on a Thursday night and check out the RIT anime Club.

748
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:52,105
Speaker 0: Yeah, what other good anime.

749
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:56,520
Speaker 0: I guess I will assume that CITA is a good club because Corbin runs it.

750
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,805
Speaker 0: Well, I guess Delaware.

751
00:56:57,825 --> 00:56:59,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Delaware anime club.

752
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,119
Speaker 0: I hear good things about what other ones are there?

753
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:12,760
Speaker 1: Um, actually there used to be a very active and awesome anime club at the University of Rochester right next to RIT But apparently there is some trouble with the college and I think they shut the club down.

754
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,830
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's back yet.

755
00:57:13,992 --> 00:57:14,658
Speaker 0: I don't know it was it.

756
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,625
Speaker 1: I mean it worked out.

757
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,819
Speaker 1: Okay, cuz they all just kind of went to the RIT anime club.

758
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,360
Speaker 0: MIT supposedly is a big anime club.

759
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,740
Speaker 1: Yep, I've heard tell that the University of Michigan has a very large and active anime club.

760
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:32,099
Speaker 1: I mean not as big as RIT anime But still very big and very active and I've news of people who went to it years and years ago.

761
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,500
Speaker 1: I know their format was in some ways similar to RIT.

762
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:39,419
Speaker 1: I should try to track those people down and see if they are still the way they are.

763
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:42,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are a lot of big anime clubs out there.

764
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:44,540
Speaker 0: on the internet there's sites that list all the anime clubs.

765
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,644
Speaker 0: You can find one.

766
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:46,587
Speaker 0: They're out there.

767
00:57:46,627 --> 00:57:48,573
Speaker 0: They're not either not difficult to find.

768
00:57:48,593 --> 00:57:49,235
Speaker 0: They're not hiding.

769
00:57:49,276 --> 00:57:49,657
Speaker 0: They want to.

770
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:50,580
Speaker 0: they want you to find them.

771
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,460
Speaker 1: Yep, anime clubs are doing just fine and they can still be about showing the anime.

772
00:57:55,901 --> 00:58:03,100
Speaker 1: It just it's a matter of showing the anime in a way that will be conducive to Modern fans still wanting to go to lot.

773
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:11,360
Speaker 1: Well not live but showings with groups of people in theaters as opposed to sitting in their smelly dorm rooms Watching I don't know negima by themselves in their underwear.

774
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,726
Speaker 0: Mmm, Wow scary.

775
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,856
Speaker 0: The thing is the people who are gonna do that.

776
00:58:15,896 --> 00:58:16,700
Speaker 0: You don't want them at your club.

777
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,906
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

778
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we can talk about that, too.

779
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:29,639
Speaker 1: there's a fine line between getting as many people in your club as possible and Keeping the people that you know will cause problems out of your club or at least minimizing the damage they will do.

780
00:58:30,403 --> 00:58:38,079
Speaker 1: So I guess the only other thing I'll open up before we end the episode is one We're gonna do our spoilers final thoughts episode sometime next year.
