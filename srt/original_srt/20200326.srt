1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,051
Speaker 0: It's Thursday March 26th 2020.

2
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,699
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:20,175
Speaker 0: tonight We are talking about insurance because we are not experts in this field.

4
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:26,220
Speaker 0: Let's do this All right.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,667
Speaker 0: So, uh try to avoid going to the grocery store like I'm doing it as little as I can like once a week go in With a list get everything to get out.

6
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:33,452
Speaker 1: Yep.

7
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:34,900
Speaker 1: Actually, it's a coincidence, right?

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:44,664
Speaker 1: So we used blue apron in the past to get meals delivered Yeah, and then I cancelled it when I moved and I was like, you know after PAX East I was like, you know What let's start up a new.

9
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:46,852
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're doing a bunch of delivery.

10
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:49,140
Speaker 1: We're doing and I was like we're doing the purple carrot.

11
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,560
Speaker 0: It's a vegan one and we're also doing this box of assorted ugly fruit.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,993
Speaker 0: It's like stuff that grocery stores were gonna send back anyway, and they just give us.

13
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,940
Speaker 0: so it's like a bunch of tomatoes and celery and stuff.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,697
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I was like, hey, why don't I try these other ones instead of blue apron, right?

15
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:05,580
Speaker 1: Let's see what they're about.

16
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,774
Speaker 1: I didn't want to try the which one was it.

17
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:14,160
Speaker 1: Hello fresh because Nothing, you know nothing to do with the service, but they advertise everywhere.

18
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:15,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they were.

19
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:21,462
Speaker 1: at one point they were marketing by harrat aggressively harassing people in the subway like they would come up to me Okay.

20
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:23,027
Speaker 1: Hey, hey, and that makes me like, alright.

21
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:26,259
Speaker 1: Well because you did that now, I'm not gonna patronize your business.

22
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:26,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

23
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,670
Speaker 1: So I went and I googled and I found one.

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,525
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, there's so many of these friggin things now It's crazy.

25
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:33,614
Speaker 1: how might how many there are?

26
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:37,600
Speaker 1: It's like picked one called home chef because it was highly rated.

27
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:41,579
Speaker 1: And then it's just and then we got locked inside after at that.

28
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:46,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people must have started tried to start these after.

29
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:51,220
Speaker 0: well cuz fresh direct It's so hard to get a delivery slot that like they're completely overwhelmed.

30
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:55,340
Speaker 0: So a lot of people have been going to these other services like well anyone who lost their job.

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,147
Speaker 1: Why doesn't fresh direct, you know hire?

32
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, make some people to make deliveries, right?

33
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:02,270
Speaker 0: I think it might just get their supply chain too.

34
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,480
Speaker 1: Well, they also just don't have as many trucks, right?

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,184
Speaker 1: You get any more trucks?

36
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:07,800
Speaker 1: Yep to make more deliveries, but the interesting thing.

37
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,220
Speaker 0: So I wanted a delivery slot on fresh direct.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,759
Speaker 0: But every time I checked all the slots for the next seven days were you know?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, we we tried once or twice also and it's like I fuck it, but I am a member of the chef's table.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,375
Speaker 0: So it's basically the rewards program.

41
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:32,880
Speaker 0: if you use it Basically, if you use it as your like primary or sole grocery store long enough, then they're just like, okay You're in our you're basically in our little rewards program.

42
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:48,110
Speaker 0: And all that means is instead of picking a time slot when you like finish a cart You can reserve a time slot in advance up to a week in advance And you can even reserve a recurring one Mm-hmm, but they're also allowed even in advance.

43
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,732
Speaker 0: I was just fucked.

44
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:52,983
Speaker 0: So last night I thought okay It's got a rollover.

45
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:57,095
Speaker 0: at some point the eighth day becomes the seventh day and appears there.

46
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:58,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone told me it was 6 a.m.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,067
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's true or not.

48
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:01,395
Speaker 0: I don't think that's true.

49
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:10,734
Speaker 0: 6 a.m is when like the cutoff is for putting in orders for like Later orders that evening and there is a 6 a.m.

50
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,180
Speaker 0: Cut off for a bunch of things on fresh, right?

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,668
Speaker 0: But I don't think that's when the thing rolls.

52
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:18,893
Speaker 0: All right, so I thought okay I'll wait till midnight and I'll see if it rolls at midnight.

53
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,748
Speaker 0: and at midnight It's not that it rolled.

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,523
Speaker 0: It's that if you click to reserve It sits there forever and then times out and I think a million people are hitting a five Mmm.

55
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:40,177
Speaker 0: But basically I did discover that later in the day like around 1 p.m The slots appear suddenly, but they only appear for the chef's table.

56
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:48,280
Speaker 0: people first Fancy and then later that day they appear for everyone else and then the chef's table ones mostly seem to sell out within like an hour.

57
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:49,562
Speaker 1: Hmm.

58
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:53,280
Speaker 1: I mean the grocery store next to us still has pretty much everything that we need.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,369
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah food seller is completely stocked.

60
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,940
Speaker 1: Like I'm not other than like toilet paper and English muffins.

61
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,622
Speaker 1: They have everything.

62
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,529
Speaker 0: my food seller has plenty of toilet paper too.

63
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,111
Speaker 0: If you run low.

64
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,580
Speaker 1: Oh, they ran out of fresh basil.

65
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,370
Speaker 0: That was it, but I finally I just got lucky.

66
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:08,237
Speaker 1: I found the food seller has TP.

67
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,263
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay.

68
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:17,700
Speaker 0: All right, cool They basically are sold out of nothing Except if you go at certain times some things are not fully stocked because they I think they're stocking less frequently.

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,316
Speaker 0: So like when we were there last time they didn't have any fish, but they had everything else.

70
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:26,819
Speaker 0: the time before that They didn't have any non fish meat, but they had like literally everything else.

71
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,035
Speaker 0: Mmm, fresh direct has everything except they're completely sold out of toilet paper.

72
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

73
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:48,952
Speaker 1: So, yeah, but yeah this home chef compared to the blue apron I have to say that on the one hand It's nice that the meals that I got were way Simpler and easier and faster to prepare who's kind of cool.

74
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:49,514
Speaker 0: That's a plus.

75
00:04:50,136 --> 00:05:01,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a plus except Part of the reason they were easier to prepare is because they weren't like bad but they're just not as Fancy and good right like one of them.

76
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:15,212
Speaker 1: the worst thing You know, it's the old the biggest thing that like, you know it was actually like a negative check mark for me was that one of the recipes included rice and Usually when a blue apron includes rice, it's like alright, here's a packet of rice.

77
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,640
Speaker 1: cook it right and I put it in my rice cooker.

78
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:25,950
Speaker 1: This one had a sealed a vacuum sealed package of already cooked rice Parboiled rice fuck that.

79
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:35,741
Speaker 1: and you were supposed to Put it in a bowl with like a couple tablespoons of water and then microwave the bowl to get the rice up to Temperature.

80
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,406
Speaker 0: Oh, that is a sad sack TV dinner right there, right?

81
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:44,405
Speaker 1: And I couldn't even I mean it tasted fine, but it's like You just don't you forget.

82
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:44,666
Speaker 1: do that.

83
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:45,770
Speaker 1: Don't even send me the rice.

84
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:47,216
Speaker 1: I can just make my own rice.

85
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:47,819
Speaker 1: I don't need this.

86
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:52,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, we restarted Blue Apron because apparently what they did is they changed.

87
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:57,179
Speaker 0: they have fewer recipes now but it's recipes they can make much more easily in bulk.

88
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:05,220
Speaker 0: and Because we didn't get fresh direct We figured that would be a good way to start cooking real meals again without having to go out to the grocery store literally every week.

89
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:09,721
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll give the home chef another, you know a little while and then you know If it's.

90
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:13,480
Speaker 1: if it's man, maybe I'll go back to Blue Apron or maybe try another one.

91
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a whole bunch of them out there.

92
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,133
Speaker 0: I'm just trying whichever

93
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,764
Speaker 1: one could make a delivery happen I'll sign up for yep,

94
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:39,900
Speaker 0: because otherwise I just got to keep going to the grocery store, which I'd rather avoid if I could Alright, so, uh in the news there's a lot of news going on, but I discovered something that seemed like a joke and I kind of thought it was someone just making a joke, but then on Wikipedia I saw it and then I kept looking around and it seems totally legit.

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:48,388
Speaker 0: Apparently the first honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters, you know, there's real members who actually perform But then there's honorary members.

96
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:51,720
Speaker 0: like when you get an honorary PhD, it doesn't mean you're a real doctor.

97
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:54,760
Speaker 0: It just means that the university wanted to recognize you in some way.

98
00:06:55,591 --> 00:07:03,559
Speaker 0: so Apparently Henry Kissinger is an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters and was the first honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters.

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,119
Speaker 1: I mean, why don't they revoke that?

100
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,322
Speaker 0: Right, like.

101
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:12,921
Speaker 0: I'm looking down this list of like the 10 notable Harlem Globetrotter like honorary people and the rest of the list is all great People.

102
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:17,700
Speaker 0: it's all like Bob Hope, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Whoopi Goldberg, Nelson Mandela.

103
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:27,694
Speaker 0: But hanging out right at number one is Henry Kissinger with and apparently he said something funny about it and Like one of the skittles in the bowl is poison.

104
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:28,959
Speaker 1: How many skittles do you eat?

105
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:34,499
Speaker 1: How many honorary Harlem Globetrotters will you will you eat?

106
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,791
Speaker 0: Of course at the same time if you've dropped your Jamaican beef patty into a pile of glass How much of that Jamaican beef patty will you risk eating?

107
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,660
Speaker 0: The answer was not zero.

108
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:56,483
Speaker 0: But uh, I do have a geek bite Emily and I. the other night we watched a movie we've been meaning to watch for a while Jojo rabbit, which Do you know anything about?

109
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:59,354
Speaker 1: I heard I heard that there was a movie called Jojo rabbit.

110
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,859
Speaker 1: I didn't I don't know nothing else.

111
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,606
Speaker 0: Treat it more like cinema.

112
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:10,158
Speaker 0: It's one of those like Oscar bait like very well done period made the movie Taika Waititi.

113
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:15,094
Speaker 0: Okay So the shtick of it, I don't know how to spoil anything.

114
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:25,319
Speaker 0: But if you put the trailers Sort of on one hand almost like give you the wrong idea of what this movie is about But on the other hand, they're actually very true to what the movie is.

115
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:29,108
Speaker 0: It's basically about a kid growing up with Hitler during Nazi, Germany.

116
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,380
Speaker 1: Why is it called Jojo rabbit?

117
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:46,440
Speaker 0: So what it really is is about a kid who is basically growing up as a child during World War two and He's a kid like he doesn't quite understand like everything and he's definitely bought into the propaganda.

118
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:47,700
Speaker 0: Like he's a member of the Hitler youth.

119
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:54,520
Speaker 0: He's totally into it and he has an imaginary friend like Hobbes and Calvin and Hobbes, but his imaginary friend is Hitler.

120
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:57,370
Speaker 1: His imaginary friend isn't Jojo rabbit.

121
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,033
Speaker 0: No, he is.

122
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:04,760
Speaker 0: His name is Jojo and The reason he is called Jojo rabbit is a plot point that I'm not gonna get into but it's the metaphor for the whole movie.

123
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:20,759
Speaker 0: But it's basically this kid with his imaginary friend Hitler traipsing around during World War two toward the end of the war and it is a Really really good movie and I hesitate to even really get into what it's really about and what the themes are.

124
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:25,939
Speaker 0: Other than that, you should watch it and I think everyone should see it be ready to cry a lot.

125
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,133
Speaker 1: I've seen almost every Nazi movie.

126
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,660
Speaker 0: There is this one's up there.

127
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,617
Speaker 0: This one deserves to be in the list of like Nazi movies.

128
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,368
Speaker 0: You need to see Uh-huh.

129
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,404
Speaker 0: All right Because it's it.

130
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:42,900
Speaker 0: it's hard to explain like the bits that are good about it without really spoiling main themes.

131
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,240
Speaker 0: But like it's Hitler and it's Hitler Hitler.

132
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:51,200
Speaker 0: But it's Hitler as imagined by a child who idolizes him having bought into the propaganda.

133
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:56,338
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, and it's just to Hitler's this like childhood imaginary friend.

134
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:56,719
Speaker 0: Let's go.

135
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,649
Speaker 0: Okay, it's an all-star cast.

136
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,215
Speaker 0: Like the the acting is amazing.

137
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:05,175
Speaker 0: The characters are great All right, whatever.

138
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,646
Speaker 1: Yeah What streaming service is it on?

139
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:09,192
Speaker 0: I just rent it.

140
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:10,035
Speaker 0: It came out recently.

141
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,640
Speaker 0: So I don't think it's on any streaming services.

142
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:16,479
Speaker 0: I rented it for $3 from Amazon Mmm, I've been using that option.

143
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:17,865
Speaker 1: You know more.

144
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:22,160
Speaker 0: yeah for a movie that I care to see like I want to see that I know is gonna be good.

145
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,880
Speaker 0: That's the option that it's guaranteed to be high quality.

146
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:32,968
Speaker 1: I don't have to fuss around on the high most even doing it for movies that I would might want to like rewatch Many times over the years.

147
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:33,852
Speaker 1: Mmm, right?

148
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,820
Speaker 1: So like Lord of the Rings movies I have on there.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I don't have I wouldn't.

150
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,197
Speaker 1: during when everyone else is buying the DVD box sets.

151
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaker 1: I refrained.

152
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,979
Speaker 1: Yep, so I don't have two statues of great.

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,425
Speaker 0: I still have those statues though.

154
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,969
Speaker 0: The hand is broken off of one of them.

155
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,356
Speaker 1: That's I guess appropriate.

156
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:52,878
Speaker 0: I Still have the hand.

157
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,651
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway But Jojo 100% a-plus movie.

158
00:10:58,671 --> 00:10:59,072
Speaker 0: go see it.

159
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:05,920
Speaker 1: So back in the day We already did a geek nights episode about the Castlevania that is on Netflix.

160
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:17,394
Speaker 1: I think we only talked about season one at the time because we don't know in season one I don't know how many even episodes of season one that we saw But I did watch season two in its entirety when it came out.

161
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:23,090
Speaker 1: and season three came out I guess a few weeks ago maybe but I watched the first half of season three.

162
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:31,919
Speaker 1: So just to update anyone on that show if you only listen to that geek nights and wanted to know more I guess.

163
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,159
Speaker 1: So the second season kicks ass.

164
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:51,884
Speaker 1: It's a lot like, you know They're going into Dracula's castle and fighting and doing the biz and oh, yeah This is all these other characters that are hanging out with sort of like Dracula's Court of you know Helping people people that would be bosses that you would fight on the way to Dracula, you know And all that stuff.

165
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,232
Speaker 0: I remember people kept making fun of it in a good way.

166
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:54,573
Speaker 0: being like.

167
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,344
Speaker 0: it's basically like Castlevania 3.

168
00:11:57,344 --> 00:11:57,979
Speaker 1: It's self-aware.

169
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:10,260
Speaker 1: So in the season three what you have is you've actually got like four different separate plot lines Going on that don't bump into each other at least not in the first five episodes.

170
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,450
Speaker 1: It's like clearly they're heading towards a snatch moment.

171
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,740
Speaker 1: All right, but to start out they're completely separate.

172
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,060
Speaker 1: So it's like the is a la card hanging out doing his thing with some new characters, right?

173
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,529
Speaker 1: completely separately.

174
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:40,938
Speaker 1: is Belmont and friend doing a thing in a creepy town with some priests that have obviously turned bad with some creepy thing going on in their church in the Like the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist and and Saint Germain shows up there, which is a little right?

175
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:59,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then separately you have one of the characters from season two who is Captured by the ice queen vampire and is dragged back to the ice palace with the other three Vampire queens is like four vampire queens that run the ice palace and he's their prisoner.

176
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,800
Speaker 1: So that's like a plot line of what's going on in the ice palace.

177
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:15,396
Speaker 1: Yeah Right, and then the fourth plot line is one of the bad dudes who is like Dracula's helper in season two Was sort of during season two got like teleported far away.

178
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,220
Speaker 1: It's like the desert.

179
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's presumably like Northern Africa.

180
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:19,329
Speaker 0: So what is he?

181
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,676
Speaker 0: just been walking back toward the plot the whole time?

182
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:23,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, right exactly.

183
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:31,380
Speaker 1: He's got like a. he's got like an army of beast men Night creatures because he's a bad dude and he got on a pirate ship.

184
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,952
Speaker 1: I guess not a pirate ship but like a cool Jamaican dude's ship.

185
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,380
Speaker 1: and the Jamaican dude brought him back to Genoa.

186
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,888
Speaker 1: Ah, he got off the be got off the boat in Genoa.

187
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:46,847
Speaker 1: So he's like on his way back with his army of Evil night creatures.

188
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,540
Speaker 0: I like an army of beast men because that just reminds me of slayers.

189
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:51,546
Speaker 1: So that's definitely my favorite plot.

190
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:56,642
Speaker 1: is the the evil beast guy and also the churchy one is kind of cliche But I'm into it.

191
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,407
Speaker 1: the ice princess one.

192
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:07,629
Speaker 1: I think could go ice print ice queen vampire one could go somewhere but it's a little man and The ala card in the woods.

193
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,060
Speaker 1: one is just like snooze time But at least that one doesn't take a lot of screen time.

194
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:20,758
Speaker 1: All four of those plot lines are gonna I guess converge at some point and everyone will be the party will get back together and They'll be action, right?

195
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,972
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll probably do a full review once we watch all of it.

196
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:30,920
Speaker 1: at this point cuz I'm watching all of it Like I'm not gonna I'm wondering how many seasons is gonna go for is like this third season can't be the final one the way.

197
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wrap all these four plot lines up in five episodes.

198
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,259
Speaker 1: I think it's a ten episode thing maybe and we've watched five.

199
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:45,894
Speaker 0: so Yeah, maybe maybe this is like the lead-up to the end and then there'll be one more season But I don't actually know.

200
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,285
Speaker 0: Actually, let's see number.

201
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,490
Speaker 0: does Wikipedia say anything.

202
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:49,690
Speaker 0: Nope.

203
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,116
Speaker 0: It only shows up through season three.

204
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:56,358
Speaker 0: Ah Doesn't say anything about a season four No idea.

205
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:57,969
Speaker 1: All right.

206
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,927
Speaker 0: All right, cool All right.

207
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:08,389
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's time for things of the day.

208
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,049
Speaker 0: What do you got so?

209
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,615
Speaker 1: Uh What was my thing of the day?

210
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:19,190
Speaker 1: Ah, yes, everyone's trapped inside right not going out and including like famous people, right?

211
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,928
Speaker 1: So you're seeing lots of people are producing lots of content, you know.

212
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:26,479
Speaker 1: Posting things on you know creative endeavors.

213
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,450
Speaker 1: They're engaging in while they're trapped inside on the internet including famous people.

214
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,310
Speaker 1: So I've seen like, you know, and it's a wide range of famous people, right and and not famous people.

215
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:42,710
Speaker 1: People are getting more creative and putting more effort into posting things to like, you know share with everyone else, right?

216
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:54,594
Speaker 1: So like you just mentioned before the show Sir Patrick Stewart got CBS to let Picard be free even to people who aren't paying or the CBS streaming Tons of like.

217
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,403
Speaker 0: little game companies are releasing like their older games for free.

218
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,188
Speaker 0: So like bored kids have something to do, right?

219
00:15:59,790 --> 00:15:59,830
Speaker 1: We?

220
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,529
Speaker 1: I just saw a video Lea's Anderson who I guess can't play hockey right now.

221
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:08,363
Speaker 1: he Just broke the record for wearing the most hockey jerseys at once.

222
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:25,900
Speaker 1: He's got nothing better to do Right, but one really interesting thing I saw was a noted astrophysicist Brian May Posted on posted on Instagram Demonstrating his guitar skills, right which?

223
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,605
Speaker 1: what is presumably his?

224
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:35,710
Speaker 1: the actual original You know red special guitar he made with his father and not some replica, I'm not expert enough to know.

225
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,989
Speaker 0: I mean, I would assume so if I had a homer bat like I would always use it.

226
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:46,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean I have seen him Use not the original one before Yeah, but anyway.

227
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:52,350
Speaker 1: but you know You see when you look at a lot of guitar lessons online, right?

228
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:59,965
Speaker 1: Because I did guitar when I was in elementary school for a few years and then I tried to learn Relearn it once or twice, right?

229
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,901
Speaker 1: But you know, mostly you're learning like scales.

230
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:14,791
Speaker 1: You're learning chords, right, you know and You don't really see when you're taking guitar lessons how to do a guitar solo Right.

231
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:21,909
Speaker 1: It's like you just sort of get good enough to the point in which you can just go go wild improvisationally on your own, right?

232
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:31,348
Speaker 1: But here he is Showing you right with the getting his phone camera really close to the guitar twice, you know playing it slowly, right?

233
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,830
Speaker 1: Exactly how he plays the solo in the middle of noted song Bohemian Rhapsody.

234
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,606
Speaker 1: So this is like a really, you know interesting kind of thing that you don't?

235
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:43,730
Speaker 1: you don't see this, right?

236
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,157
Speaker 1: I've never seen a guitar lesson.

237
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,001
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's out there.

238
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,288
Speaker 1: Someone's gonna point to them, right?

239
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,128
Speaker 1: But I've never seen a guitar lesson that's like here's how to play the crazy solo that you know.

240
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,035
Speaker 0: Because like in high school we I literally get like there'd be clinics on like how to do improvisation and a lot of the Aspects of those clinics.

241
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:08,750
Speaker 0: they'd have us study and then recreate other people's Improvisational solos as practice and then we'd have to do our own solos over the same chord progressions, right?

242
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,993
Speaker 1: But here he's actually showing you like, you know the actual Technique.

243
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:13,294
Speaker 1: he's like.

244
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:17,630
Speaker 1: look, you know, I strum this note and but then I you know go on and off.

245
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:19,701
Speaker 1: I'm not actually strumming every note.

246
00:18:19,842 --> 00:18:21,651
Speaker 1: Yeah this way in that way He's like.

247
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,721
Speaker 1: he's like even in such a brief Instagram video.

248
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:30,849
Speaker 1: It's actually way better at teaching Than a lot of other instructional videos I've seen.

249
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,893
Speaker 1: So if anyone cares about guitars Or astrophysics.

250
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:43,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you can read his thesis a survey of radial velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud from 2008.

251
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:46,179
Speaker 0: Yeah So my thing today real simple.

252
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,585
Speaker 0: This is I just found this.

253
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:48,670
Speaker 0: I don't even know where I found it.

254
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,235
Speaker 0: It's just this cute short animation.

255
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:51,118
Speaker 0: Dr.

256
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:54,709
Speaker 0: Mario is apparently doing a speedrun of his own game.

257
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:54,769
Speaker 0: Dr.

258
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,806
Speaker 0: Mario Luigi's timing him and he starts showing off and that's it.

259
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,952
Speaker 0: That's the whole video Dr.

260
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,294
Speaker 1: Mario.

261
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:02,742
Speaker 1: speedrunning is a thing a lot.

262
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:04,170
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of people do it on Twitch.

263
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,704
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember my big moment of speedrunning.

264
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:12,189
Speaker 0: cuz like speedrunning has been a thing for a while But the one years ago I was thinking to myself

265
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:13,373
Speaker 1: Man

266
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:25,568
Speaker 0: I'd love to see a speedrun of like a 40-hour RPG and sure enough when I search for it I'd realize that there is a thriving community of people speedrunning like Final Fantasy 7 or some shit.

267
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,133
Speaker 1: Yeah Well speedrunning.

268
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:27,414
Speaker 1: Dr.

269
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:31,045
Speaker 1: Mario is interesting because you know, you're not going for score right?

270
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:37,123
Speaker 1: What you're trying to do is Beat it beat the levels with as few pieces as possible.

271
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:39,550
Speaker 1: right the less pieces used the less waiting there is.

272
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,535
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of RNG to add some excitement Especially toward.

273
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,490
Speaker 1: you're like about to clear the level and you might not get the piece you need.

274
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,229
Speaker 1: You've only got one color left for example.

275
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:49,834
Speaker 1: But there's also.

276
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:50,356
Speaker 1: you want to.

277
00:19:50,396 --> 00:20:00,890
Speaker 1: you know, whenever you clear something if there's any pills that fall they go do do do do do And right and then you can't bring out your next pill until all the falling pieces have fallen.

278
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:04,789
Speaker 1: So you need to play in such a way that you reduce how far?

279
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,441
Speaker 1: Broken off pill pieces fall.

280
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:09,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, that just that just kills.

281
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,350
Speaker 1: Well, that just eats up your clock a whole bunch while you're waiting before you could bring out the next piece.

282
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,936
Speaker 1: So it's actually it's.

283
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,748
Speaker 1: it's pretty tough and pretty interesting way to play.

284
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:18,969
Speaker 1: Dr.

285
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:25,629
Speaker 0: Mario Yeah in the moment if you notice that we sound a little different that there's a little more pausing We talk over each other a little bit.

286
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:37,471
Speaker 0: This is the well the third time ever because apparently neither one of us remember that we did record geek nights Remotely once back in 2009 and somehow Luke remembered that even though neither one of us There's

287
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:38,415
Speaker 1: it only one episode

288
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:44,369
Speaker 0: one episode when you were already in your new apartment in the city And I was still sleeping at the Beacon House.

289
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:51,225
Speaker 0: okay during that like three-week period where we were like moving everything around and like finalizing our flight from upstate.

290
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:58,366
Speaker 0: so once in 2009 once two days ago and now today have we ever recorded geek nights remotely?

291
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:03,250
Speaker 0: it is More challenging than the normal show for a lot of reasons like the delay.

292
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:08,430
Speaker 0: While it's slight and while I it doesn't like you won't hear it in the show because I can slide things and edit it out.

293
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,081
Speaker 0: It does make it easier for us to talk over each other.

294
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:13,010
Speaker 0: It's harder to like key off a body language.

295
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,903
Speaker 0: We got to do some fucking body language.

296
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:18,389
Speaker 1: I don't see with my eyes closed Yeah, but I can see yours and with you facing away from me.

297
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you'll like shuffle a little bit like when I'm not when you're talking when you're saying a long thing I kind of lean back.

298
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:24,458
Speaker 0: I turn around and look at you.

299
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,165
Speaker 0: You don't see it cuz your eyes are closed.

300
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:30,170
Speaker 0: Nope Also just headphones like that's not as comfortable.

301
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,038
Speaker 0: I can't do the live stream as easily though.

302
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,510
Speaker 0: I might be able to start live streaming this again soon.

303
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:37,490
Speaker 0: I just didn't want to bother this week while we were testing.

304
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:42,270
Speaker 0: So yeah for the foreseeable future geek nights might sound a little weird and I just got to deal with it.

305
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:42,994
Speaker 0: It's this or nothing.

306
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:45,165
Speaker 1: Let's let's this weekend.

307
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,050
Speaker 1: We got nothing else to do.

308
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,483
Speaker 1: Let's figure out how to get to 2p one stream.

309
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,266
Speaker 1: Yeah.

310
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:54,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do it With video games maybe even also or anything.

311
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,348
Speaker 0: Yeah video versus two-player games.

312
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,010
Speaker 0: It'd be really good.

313
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:03,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just want to be able for us to both stream to a thing and for that thing to stream to the Internet.

314
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:08,305
Speaker 0: Yep, our combined video feeds because then we could play.

315
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,258
Speaker 0: we could play some games We could like just play counter-strike do a lot of stuff.

316
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,142
Speaker 0: Yeah on opposite teams.

317
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got time.

318
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:17,774
Speaker 0: Yeah we're gonna try to make a lot of content and stay tuned as soon as There might.

319
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:25,270
Speaker 0: there will hopefully be a point where even if the world still kind of locked down We can get together the two of us to do like in-person video.

320
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,990
Speaker 0: Because one thing we do want to do at some point is try to make this is warm enough to bite.

321
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:30,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can make panels.

322
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:32,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can in fact.

323
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,720
Speaker 0: and why they think the one conventions to go to?

324
00:22:34,761 --> 00:22:38,635
Speaker 1: we just do panels without the convention and just put The panels on YouTube.

325
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:43,941
Speaker 0: Yep, but we can treat them like a panel which is very different for the way retreat Oh show like and we won't prepare restrictions.

326
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,173
Speaker 1: We won't have the restrictions on time We won't have.

327
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:48,830
Speaker 0: we should still force ourselves to go no more than an hour.

328
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:49,213
Speaker 0: I think.

329
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,009
Speaker 1: well, I mean I was thinking that we can do less than it.

330
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,529
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we can do an hour.

331
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:55,930
Speaker 0: We can do like we used to do at PAX is those 20-minute panels, which I love.

332
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,410
Speaker 1: We don't have to fill an hour and we can do whatever fucking topic we want.

333
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,285
Speaker 1: It doesn't have to fit the convention and no one approves or rejects it.

334
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:06,246
Speaker 0: We just do what we want Yep, and then you know what I'm gonna do once we.

335
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:06,970
Speaker 0: once we do this.

336
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,077
Speaker 0: I want to send them to.

337
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:09,165
Speaker 0: like y'all get all the packs.

338
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:12,923
Speaker 0: people be like look These are the panels that you have been rejecting all these years.

339
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:15,796
Speaker 0: when you want us to do the 40 games You must play for the eighth time.

340
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:18,570
Speaker 1: I could also like do some on my own or you know.

341
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:20,818
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'll probably still.

342
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,663
Speaker 1: I'll still make slides.

343
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:26,510
Speaker 0: Yep, but the main thing I'm gonna say it out loud on the show because I'm it's gonna force me to do it.

344
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,489
Speaker 0: My goal this weekend is to be able to stream with multiple camera angles myself playing DDR.

345
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,689
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm just gonna do DDR live streams.

346
00:23:37,252 --> 00:23:41,067
Speaker 0: I got an idea how to do it and I'm gonna try it out and we'll see how it goes cuz.

347
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:46,928
Speaker 0: uh If I'm stuck inside for this long and it's gonna be like shitty and rainy all weekend I think I'm just playing DDR every day.

348
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,650
Speaker 0: Hmm the book club book is still the tale of Genji not the tale of Hanzo.

349
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,744
Speaker 0: We don't have a commute not pooping at work anymore.

350
00:23:54,804 --> 00:24:04,037
Speaker 0: So I don't really have like Time to sit and read because as much as I could read I've actually been reading but I've been reading comics Which I didn't read as much.

351
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:07,567
Speaker 0: Yeah before I am also reading a comic that we'll do a show on next week.

352
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:21,866
Speaker 0: Oh good Yeah But I'm mostly playing video games and working out every video game season right now Like the other thing I'm doing this weekend and I'm not streaming it because Even my god computer cannot do VR in high quality and stream at the same time.

353
00:24:21,886 --> 00:24:23,170
Speaker 1: You got to use daddy to computer.

354
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,528
Speaker 0: Yep I could use one computer if I turn the settings down but fuck that.

355
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,930
Speaker 1: Use one computer and the other computer has a capture card and does that right?

356
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then that's tricky with VR for a bunch of reasons.

357
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:35,287
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into right now.

358
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:41,947
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's doable It's just it's a pain in the ass But I'm gonna play through half-life Alex because every review says it's great.

359
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,033
Speaker 1: Yeah Any official.

360
00:24:44,595 --> 00:24:54,010
Speaker 0: there was the one review of someone who played the whole game in one weekend and they were having hallucinations for weeks afterward Like real-world hallucinations from the VR world.

361
00:24:56,092 --> 00:25:03,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like that edges into what happened to us when we first learned DDR And we'd like have those dreams of arrows at night like every night for weeks.

362
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,319
Speaker 0: So, yeah insurance.

363
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,329
Speaker 0: we don't know much about insurance, but we got opinions on it.

364
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:14,023
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not actuaries, right?

365
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:15,390
Speaker 1: We're not in the insurance industry.

366
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:23,137
Speaker 1: I know high-level stuff, but I think a lot of people just in general especially kids who don't learn this You know, no one ever taught me in school.

367
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:28,089
Speaker 1: So I presume no one else is learning in school like What insurance is how?

368
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:33,166
Speaker 0: Anything like and even I need a lot of people who are adults like where there is like.

369
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,110
Speaker 0: some insurance is stupid.

370
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,177
Speaker 0: Some insurance is bad.

371
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:42,787
Speaker 0: some insurance would be good But due to the lack of regulation or the lack of social safety nets is broken in some fundamental way.

372
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:50,167
Speaker 0: some insurance however is so cheap and so worth it and yet there are a lot of adults who don't buy it.

373
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:57,087
Speaker 0: like Imagine paying four dollars a month and you don't have to worry about like literally anything happening in your apartment Like you're just fine, right?

374
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,037
Speaker 1: So fundamentally what insurance is is gambling.

375
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:05,110
Speaker 1: you're betting right and there is some company that is betting the opposite of.

376
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:08,041
Speaker 1: You know what you're betting right.

377
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,630
Speaker 1: so it's like a casino, right?

378
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:16,669
Speaker 1: I bet the dice the roulette wheel is gonna come on zero zero and the casino is like I will definitely bet the opposite of that.

379
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,438
Speaker 0: But it's not quite gambling because there is a much more.

380
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,990
Speaker 0: a big component of insurance is the idea that you're distributing risk.

381
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:29,050
Speaker 0: The person who is providing insurance isn't directly betting that you yourself will not need to use the insurance.

382
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,440
Speaker 0: They're using data to show that.

383
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:39,250
Speaker 0: alright if we sell it to end people Odds are only n minus X people will need to use the insurance.

384
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:42,468
Speaker 0: So if we charge this much we can make a guaranteed profit of X?

385
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:52,608
Speaker 0: Well, I guess not X because I used X. we can make a guaranteed profit of Z while also providing insurance to all these people and being able to pay out anyone who has a problem.

386
00:26:53,089 --> 00:27:02,290
Speaker 0: and then Often those insurance companies will then get another insurance company to cover what might happen if suddenly Everybody needs a pad all at once for some reason, right?

387
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:07,542
Speaker 1: So for example, let's say I have a you know You're betting that something bad will happen to you.

388
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:13,600
Speaker 1: right and in that way I'm placing that bet if nothing bad happens to you.

389
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,390
Speaker 1: Well, you lost some money, but nothing bad happened to you.

390
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, but also bad.

391
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:31,469
Speaker 1: if the bad thing does happen Someone is gonna take a bunch of use a bunch of money and take corrective action To fix as much as possible the bad thing that happened to you.

392
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, well like you broke your arm in Australia and you had trip insurance.

393
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,398
Speaker 0: Mmm, I mean Australia has good health care.

394
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:45,870
Speaker 0: So it wasn't that important but still the insurance was like, alright Here's a giant pain in the ass is gonna happen to you and we are obligated by law to throw money at that problem.

395
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:51,470
Speaker 1: So let's say there's a risk you have in your life, you know, I'm going on a vacation.

396
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,564
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of risks involved with going on a vacation.

397
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,010
Speaker 1: What if I lose my luggage?

398
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if I get sick and can't go?

399
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,143
Speaker 0: what if?

400
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:00,750
Speaker 0: what if I get trapped?

401
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,981
Speaker 0: What if the player line shuts down while I'm there right?

402
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,550
Speaker 1: There's so many things that can go wrong on a vacation, right?

403
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:15,067
Speaker 1: So the insurance company is like they don't come to me like Scott and say hmm Scott We're gonna bet your vacations gonna go wrong because that would just be gambling for both of us.

404
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:15,670
Speaker 1: Like who knows?

405
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not gonna make that bet but they do know.

406
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:20,234
Speaker 1: aha All right.

407
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:29,610
Speaker 1: Well with this list of things that can go wrong on a vacation What are the odds, you know, what percentage of people who go on vacation have one of these things happen to them, right?

408
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:37,458
Speaker 1: So it's like okay of a million people go on vacation 1% of them lose their luggage an average.

409
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:43,012
Speaker 1: it cost them about this much money to replace the lost luggage and solve their problem Right.

410
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:47,930
Speaker 1: So we want to charge them less than that amount individually, right?

411
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,653
Speaker 1: No one wants to.

412
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:53,032
Speaker 1: because if you if the purse individual person has to pay that amount to replace their luggage Well, it's like.

413
00:28:53,052 --> 00:28:53,594
Speaker 1: well, why did I?

414
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:54,798
Speaker 1: I'm not gambling?

415
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,930
Speaker 1: because I could just save that money and fix the problem myself with the money.

416
00:28:58,131 --> 00:29:00,693
Speaker 0: Yep, right like one way Mitigation.

417
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:10,010
Speaker 0: one way to mitigate risk is if I'm going on a trip I could set aside $40,000 as my emergency fund and not touch it till I get home from the vacation, right exactly.

418
00:29:10,151 --> 00:29:14,250
Speaker 1: So you they need to figure out okay, how many people will have the problem?

419
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,810
Speaker 1: How much is it gonna cost on average?

420
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:22,330
Speaker 1: Yeah And then can we charge a large number of people a small amount of money?

421
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,970
Speaker 1: Less than the amount it costs to fix the problem for one of the people, right?

422
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:33,700
Speaker 1: Every individual person who's paying for the insurance is paying less than what it would cost to fix the problem for themselves.

423
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:42,316
Speaker 1: But total you add up all the little bits of money from all the people and you say, alright well all those little bits of money from all the people.

424
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:46,290
Speaker 1: only this percentage of people have the problem and that'll so and we can.

425
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,470
Speaker 1: So we lose that money to fix people's problems.

426
00:29:50,012 --> 00:30:02,190
Speaker 1: But there's still money left over because so many people signed up for it and such a small percentage had the problem And we figured out exactly how much to charge where they're actuarial mess that we the insurance company make a bunch of money

427
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:15,010
Speaker 0: And even better they often because if it's a large insurance company They cannot use that data and use their Operational efficiency to make it cheaper for them to handle that kind of problem than any individual person could make it.

428
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:18,542
Speaker 0: so like they might have a relationship like a travel insurance company.

429
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:35,884
Speaker 0: a real one a good one probably has Relationships with most of the major airlines and they can like cut deals Like if you cancel your trip they work at work with Delta or whatever to put give those tickets to someone else and They actually cost them less to deal with the problem that it would cost you on your own.

430
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:41,110
Speaker 0: talking to the airline or the airline On their own without an insurance company managing this risk pool, right?

431
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,970
Speaker 1: You the negotiating power of one person is pretty weak against a giant airline, right?

432
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,950
Speaker 1: You go to the airline and something bad happens, right and you don't have insurance.

433
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:49,140
Speaker 1: So you just go and fight with them.

434
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,230
Speaker 1: You're like, I want the money back.

435
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,673
Speaker 1: They're like no Deal with it.

436
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:54,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, you signed up for this flight.

437
00:30:54,578 --> 00:31:02,130
Speaker 1: you you know, whatever right but the travel insurance company is like We have this many customers, right?

438
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:05,997
Speaker 1: We can you know, we have Bargaining clout with you.

439
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:08,185
Speaker 1: We're also a big company with a shit ton of money.

440
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:14,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, right airline You better do this for our customers and it's like oh, okay.

441
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:24,650
Speaker 1: So that means you know the cost to reschedule my flight on my own would be a thousand dollars But the insurance company has a with their bargaining power and negotiated the airline down.

442
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:33,729
Speaker 1: It's only five hundred dollars and I'm indirectly benefiting from that Discount bargaining power because the insurance company is taking care of the biz for me.

443
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,998
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't have to go in and negotiate with the airline myself.

444
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:45,383
Speaker 0: now on a high level the idea of distributed risk and insurance Is like yeah, I don't know how many of you might be stupid libertarians or something.

445
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:47,890
Speaker 0: It is a necessary part of modern society.

446
00:31:47,970 --> 00:32:01,570
Speaker 0: There is a reason insurance the concept of insurance has existed for a long long time but at the same time We use insurance for a lot of things We really should be using something else for like for example health care.

447
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:08,370
Speaker 0: the fact that you have to have health insurance is ridiculous because Some kinds of insurance are purely optional.

448
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,910
Speaker 0: Like do I want to pay the seven dollars for insurance on my Amtrak to Rochester?

449
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,470
Speaker 0: Or do I my willing to eat the possibility that I might have to deal with some trouble on this trip?

450
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:17,711
Speaker 0: Like.

451
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:22,169
Speaker 0: that's a reasonable cost-benefit analysis that a person could make to decide if it's worth it.

452
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:28,070
Speaker 0: But no one should have to decide whether or not I think I'm gonna get sick in the next ten years.

453
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:29,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not a thing.

454
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:30,939
Speaker 1: You should be betting on.

455
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:33,870
Speaker 1: that's just a risk that should be eliminated completely.

456
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, insurance gonna happen.

457
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:41,870
Speaker 0: insurance should be one means of eliminating risk But we should not use it as the sole means of eliminating or mitigating risk.

458
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:55,712
Speaker 1: Well, I mean assurance is is best for things that will affect a small number of people right but could potentially Inflict a large number of people or likely or for things They're all.

459
00:32:55,832 --> 00:33:07,190
Speaker 0: insurance is also good for things where an adult of sound minds can reasonably be expected to make a decision About whether or not they need this protection or are willing to assume that risk.

460
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:09,518
Speaker 0: Like there are some risks that we allowed.

461
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,250
Speaker 0: people like I I ski I am allowed to assume the risk of skiing.

462
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:28,330
Speaker 1: I am not allowed to assume the risk of fighting in a gladiatorial deathmatch Mm-hmm, except unless I'm on the barge Right, but the point is is that you know Even dangerous dangerous skiing a large percentage of the people who ski don't get hurt at all.

463
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:34,029
Speaker 1: Yeah but I but I can everyone who skis put in a little bit of money to cover the people who did get hurt skiing.

464
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:42,490
Speaker 1: the People who didn't get hurt wouldn't be losing that much and they would gain peace of mind Knowing that if they fell off the ski lift, they would be taken care of with money.

465
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:46,870
Speaker 0: The problem is what actually covers that is just people's health insurance.

466
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:52,010
Speaker 0: But there is a sort of form of interesting a hypothetical ski insurance.

467
00:33:52,050 --> 00:34:00,197
Speaker 0: But you're closer to the mark than you realize because there is an implicit built-in ski insurance and especially at resorts And that is ski patrol.

468
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:03,010
Speaker 0: because basically to ski you need a lift ticket.

469
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,349
Speaker 0: That's the thing that allows you to go up the lift.

470
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,630
Speaker 0: A lot of resorts like you can hike up the mountain if you want then, you know what I got.

471
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:14,379
Speaker 0: You don't gotta pay or you gotta pay like 10 bucks for like a mountain pass But it takes all day to hike up the mountain.

472
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,429
Speaker 0: you ski down once now the sun's down you're done.

473
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:17,708
Speaker 0: So you pay for the lift ticket?

474
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,690
Speaker 0: The lift ticket doesn't just pay for like all the staff of the resort to make things work and all that stuff.

475
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,661
Speaker 0: It also pays for the support structures around ski patrol.

476
00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:33,458
Speaker 0: and ski patrol are the people who are basically skiing all day But they're also EMTs and experts.

477
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:38,897
Speaker 0: They're the ones who will save you if you hurt yourself on the mountain And so effectively.

478
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:41,630
Speaker 0: and it's not just your lift ticket fees that pay for that.

479
00:34:41,730 --> 00:35:05,450
Speaker 0: it's also a lot of skiers when they get older volunteer to be ski patrol to sort of like pay it forward and you basically have The system where if you go to any modern ski resort like anywhere in the world There will be people who will not charge you any money and will basically do everything they can to save you if you hurt yourself Or have a problem on the mountain, so we all pay in and then we all reduce our risk for everybody, right?

480
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:12,775
Speaker 1: But the point I was trying to make is that with the ski the theoretical ski insurance a lot of people never get Never file a claim.

481
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, never get paid out like look.

482
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,370
Speaker 0: I've been skiing for about 20 years, but I have health insurance.

483
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,119
Speaker 0: I've had two series.

484
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,050
Speaker 1: everyone gets paid out on health insurance.

485
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,181
Speaker 1: You are going you're a human being you're mortal.

486
00:35:23,784 --> 00:35:28,750
Speaker 1: in some time in your life Every single person is going to be need to get paid out, right?

487
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:37,675
Speaker 1: So insurance is a good model for something where a small percentage of people in the in the pool Ever make a claim.

488
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:45,648
Speaker 1: if you have an insurance and everyone is posting is making a claim at some point That's not a thing that we should be using insurance to help out with.

489
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:49,938
Speaker 0: yeah exactly Which ties back into that idea that it can't.

490
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,118
Speaker 0: it has to be something that a person can reasonably Choose to accept that risk.

491
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:58,974
Speaker 0: and if we don't let me fight in a gladiatorial arena We wouldn't let.

492
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,099
Speaker 0: we shouldn't let me decide.

493
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,253
Speaker 0: I don't ever need to go to a doctor in my entire life Right?

494
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:06,830
Speaker 1: so some other things you know insurance from like the non.

495
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:11,744
Speaker 1: There's a consurances that people don't see when they're not a can because they're only consumers.

496
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:12,587
Speaker 1: right you're consumer.

497
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:12,887
Speaker 1: you see.

498
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:13,750
Speaker 1: car insurance?

499
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

500
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:17,269
Speaker 0: renters insurance homeowners insurance.

501
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,099
Speaker 1: Right travelers insurance.

502
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,210
Speaker 1: We just talked about pet insurance recently.

503
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:36,437
Speaker 0: Yeah, my work started offering it, but then there's like like packs like conventions venue insurance event insurance There's all this like back-end insurance that has to exist for a lot of the things you do in your life to even be offered As services right.

504
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:37,099
Speaker 1: so it's like all right.

505
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,047
Speaker 1: I want to start a. you know a business.

506
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:39,890
Speaker 1: What's your business?

507
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,145
Speaker 1: I don't know a grocery store all right well I need insurance that is going to cover right.

508
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:52,629
Speaker 1: if Someone eats food in my store and gets sick and tries to sue me right which you're right Then I need this insurance to help me out.

509
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, to sort of cover my ass

510
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:05,688
Speaker 0: like I was you know happen like you know my last job Ibo's effectively like I did a lot of our risk assessment and one of the things I had to review was all the different kinds of insurance we have for some sock audits and things.

511
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:16,867
Speaker 0: and Like even a tiny company that has like 30 or 40 employees We had like five different types of insurance to cover all the kinds of crap that can happen in the kind of industry we were working in.

512
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:22,150
Speaker 1: and Because if any one of those five things happened, and you didn't have the insurance you would be boned yep.

513
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:29,878
Speaker 0: And it gets complicated like there's this concept of umbrella insurance and even like a tiny business like geek nights We could get umbrella insurance.

514
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:39,090
Speaker 0: It's basically insurance that covers Anything fucky that could happen that isn't specifically excluded and or specifically usually covered by other kinds of insurance.

515
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:43,220
Speaker 0: But then you get specific stuff like indemnity insurance or like.

516
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:46,007
Speaker 0: you can get insurance against what if some?

517
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:46,890
Speaker 0: what if an engineer?

518
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:53,175
Speaker 0: Pirate some code like steal some source code and puts it in your product and like no one noticed And then you get sued.

519
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:57,370
Speaker 0: you can get insurance for that specific thing All right, and then you just fight.

520
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,993
Speaker 1: You know you.

521
00:37:58,073 --> 00:38:01,930
Speaker 1: if you didn't do it on purpose because your company like you know the thing that happened you were car.

522
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,919
Speaker 1: It wasn't your company's actual strategy.

523
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:09,363
Speaker 1: You know where you're supposed to get sued for that Just be like oh oops my bad settle out of court.

524
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:11,050
Speaker 1: the insurance money takes care of it yep.

525
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:19,010
Speaker 1: So I think the insurance that's in that category that most people are aware of is doctors malpractice insurance Yep, which is a form of indemnity insurance.

526
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:26,008
Speaker 1: Yes, it's like you're a doctor And it's like you're doing your best at doctoring and even if you follow all the best things as a doctor.

527
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:39,392
Speaker 1: It's like Medicines messy yep, and you know There's lawyers out there, and there's people who go to the doctor and if their experience isn't perfect They're gonna try to sue the doctor that equivalent exams are right and sometimes They're wrong.

528
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:42,364
Speaker 0: that equivalent exists for everything like one of the other one.

529
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:42,785
Speaker 0: I remember.

530
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:45,078
Speaker 0: I'm just looking at like old emails I said to remember the stuff.

531
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:46,386
Speaker 0: cuz I'm not I'm running.

532
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:59,596
Speaker 0: we are getting down to the depths of what I know about insurance, but Errors and omissions insurance is pretty fun too because that's basically the yeah if we fuck something up like sorry We're good work.

533
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,530
Speaker 0: It's not our big talk to those guys.

534
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,212
Speaker 0: They'll pay for it.

535
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:06,770
Speaker 1: the most fascinating insurance that I'm aware of is prize insurance, right?

536
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:13,070
Speaker 1: So let's say you want to run a contest or like a game show and you have like some huge jackpot or something right?

537
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,001
Speaker 1: But it's sometimes you have a guaranteed jackpot.

538
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,070
Speaker 1: That's like someone's gonna win the jackpot.

539
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,507
Speaker 1: It's these odds and you have some way to pay for it.

540
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:23,599
Speaker 1: But sometimes it's like you say you're running.

541
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:24,061
Speaker 1: I don't know.

542
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:25,146
Speaker 1: freaking jeopardy.

543
00:39:25,186 --> 00:39:26,050
Speaker 1: the TV show right.

544
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,724
Speaker 1: It's like most people per episode are only winning like thousands of dollars.

545
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:30,944
Speaker 1: right?

546
00:39:30,964 --> 00:39:32,910
Speaker 1: you're a big TV show with big sponsors.

547
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:33,976
Speaker 1: You can pay for that.

548
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:42,285
Speaker 1: It's not a big deal right, but if you have like Small chance of the jackpot that could happen, but hardly ever happens probably won't happen right?

549
00:39:42,766 --> 00:39:46,442
Speaker 1: you can get insurance Prize insurance right.

550
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:50,126
Speaker 1: a good example would be that Who wants to be a millionaire show?

551
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:50,186
Speaker 1: no?

552
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that show had insurance in case someone became a millionaire.

553
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:59,065
Speaker 1: right because most Contestants weren't gonna win a million dollars.

554
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:01,637
Speaker 1: most contestants We're just gonna win thousands or less.

555
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,283
Speaker 0: and it's still not really super gambling.

556
00:40:03,303 --> 00:40:04,326
Speaker 0: because think about how that would work.

557
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:13,310
Speaker 0: the company that would Issue insurance to a game show like that would issue it to a lot of game shows Right and it also it wouldn't necessarily be the cheapest insurance.

558
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,937
Speaker 1: Yeah They would do the math and figure you can like that's.

559
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:17,723
Speaker 0: that's manually under written insurance.

560
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:19,610
Speaker 0: if you want to ensure something weird like what?

561
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,132
Speaker 0: Was that thing?

562
00:40:20,373 --> 00:40:24,290
Speaker 0: we're gonna put this diamond on the front of an f1 car as a stone.

563
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:29,230
Speaker 1: Have you ever seen if you ever read the Mongo or watch the anime master Keaton?

564
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:30,713
Speaker 1: Where he's?

565
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:32,137
Speaker 1: he's an insurance inspect.

566
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:33,420
Speaker 0: also try gun fruit.

567
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:36,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, try gun and master Keaton are about the same thing.

568
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,030
Speaker 1: All right, they're my insurance inspector.

569
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:41,630
Speaker 1: He's working for Lloyd's of London, right?

570
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:48,450
Speaker 1: So someone filed an insurance claim and he goes out to make sure it's legit and not insurance fraud of some kind.

571
00:40:49,211 --> 00:41:00,610
Speaker 1: Right and he ends up in crazy situations because these aren't normal everyday insurance claims Like big-deal crazy insurance claims, I'm like a famous painting got stolen or all, you know all kinds of nonsense.

572
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:13,549
Speaker 0: So other than health insurance Which is a topic that is way Beyond the scope of what we want to talk about in this show The insurance that I'm I've always been the most mad about in my entire life But for a lot of kind of complicated reasons is car insurance.

573
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:19,750
Speaker 0: That's the one I'm mad about because I'm what and it the rent Scott and I would talk about this a lot at RIT.

574
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:24,849
Speaker 1: Well when cars mattered more and we had less money to pay for insurance, yeah, I couldn't afford.

575
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:26,047
Speaker 1: now I don't have to pay car insurance.

576
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:27,697
Speaker 1: now I just don't have a car that has everything.

577
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:32,280
Speaker 0: and I just had like PLPD like I had the shittiest Possible insurance I could like.

578
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,089
Speaker 0: that was I was allowed to get on my car.

579
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:39,090
Speaker 0: But when it came to comes down to the reason I'm mad about car insurance, is that one?

580
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:49,310
Speaker 0: The fact that you can cause so much damage with a car to other things around you You should have to have some insurance to cover the damage you might cause.

581
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,497
Speaker 0: Like I feel like that's me recursively.

582
00:41:52,557 --> 00:42:01,690
Speaker 1: I think we shouldn't require car insurance, but I also think that You shouldn't be allowed to drive unless you're like a fucking super expert incredible driver.

583
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:02,248
Speaker 0: Well, let's get it.

584
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:13,951
Speaker 1: Also, if you I also believe that if you fuck up driving even once even if you small fuck up driving I'm talking like you're driving and there's a red light and your car goes over the white line a little bit because you weren't perfect at Driving.

585
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:15,376
Speaker 1: banned from driving forever.

586
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:17,643
Speaker 0: You would be banned from driving then sure.

587
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:18,506
Speaker 1: That's fine.

588
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:19,590
Speaker 1: Not a super expert driver.

589
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:29,712
Speaker 1: And also, I think that if you are caught driving when you're not supposed to like you got banned from driving forever and you drive jail Fuck you.

590
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:33,142
Speaker 0: See I'm thinking more along the lines of the problem I have with car insurance.

591
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:35,710
Speaker 0: Was that all car accidents?

592
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,990
Speaker 0: Like well, ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of them.

593
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:49,929
Speaker 0: There's a tiny tiny like vanishingly small percentage of car accidents that are caused by Flukes of nature or you know force majeure Like a tree falls on your car.

594
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:55,770
Speaker 0: Yeah Like a tree that had no outward problems in clear sunny weather just like fucking falls over on your car while you're driving.

595
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:56,661
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do right?

596
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:02,910
Speaker 1: You're right You're driving down the road and something literally like just shoots out into the road from the side.

597
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,721
Speaker 1: Yeah, dear, but and you there's no way you could have seen it is impossible Yeah, and you weren't even speeding or anything.

598
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:09,030
Speaker 0: but most car accidents.

599
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:10,193
Speaker 0: It is there.

600
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:15,426
Speaker 0: it is very clear that one of the drivers caused that accident due to negligence.

601
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:23,481
Speaker 0: like exactly all the time There's almost always the negligent party and what I was always mad about as a kid Was I was in Michigan and I had to.

602
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:28,244
Speaker 0: I got my first car and I got car insurance And I learned about the concept of no fault insurance.

603
00:43:28,646 --> 00:43:38,316
Speaker 0: on one hand It's good and that it prevents a situation where everybody's suing everyone all the time every time there's a car accident But on the other hand it removes

604
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:38,517
Speaker 1: the

605
00:43:38,677 --> 00:43:51,970
Speaker 0: punishment or the it removes a way to punish or otherwise Force the consequences of a poor decision out of the person who made that poor decision Like someone who's a shitty driver and causes accidents.

606
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:58,450
Speaker 0: The only consequence to them really if they don't die in a car accident is that their insurance slowly costs more over time.

607
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:04,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is that the whole car situation breaks into too many social justice areas.

608
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,882
Speaker 1: It's like oh, we're gonna start punishing drivers the way Scott just said.

609
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:09,990
Speaker 1: Okay, all the black people going to jail?

610
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,497
Speaker 1: Yeah like there's not or even just can't.

611
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:22,526
Speaker 0: what about like old people and people who have Disabilities where the car is the only way to get around because there's literally only one city Episode that's now insurance because there's only one city in America that has real mass transit.

612
00:44:22,566 --> 00:44:23,762
Speaker 0: We happen to live in it like.

613
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:24,895
Speaker 0: But I'm just.

614
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:31,970
Speaker 0: I was mad as a kid about the fact that car Insurance did not force the person who was at fault to pay for all the damages.

615
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:35,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean or at least cause their insurance to pay for all the damages.

616
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:40,510
Speaker 0: I didn't want my insurance to have to pay for someone else's damages if they hit me from behind.

617
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:41,976
Speaker 0: That's what I was mad about.

618
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:45,210
Speaker 1: It's it's a it's a. it's a double miscarriage of justice, right?

619
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:54,107
Speaker 1: On the one hand if we always correctly punish the person who's bad at driving Right, we will then cause because our society is car, right?

620
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,600
Speaker 1: Unless we fix that by winning the war on cars because we'll

621
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,523
Speaker 0: partly punish we

622
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:12,270
Speaker 1: think right unless we win the war on cars then as long right as long as you have a car culture if we if we Justifiably punish anyone who fucks up at driving that will be a miscarriage of social justice.

623
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,995
Speaker 0: Yep, like for example, we want everyone to be good We have to get rid of cars.

624
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:20,734
Speaker 0: most people in America even I mean a lot of people are bad drivers Even though there's no excuse.

625
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:26,129
Speaker 0: like a a lot of people got real driver's ed and learned how to drive They're just shitty drivers.

626
00:45:26,512 --> 00:45:30,590
Speaker 0: But there's also a lot of people who probably just didn't have access to good driver's ed.

627
00:45:31,273 --> 00:45:34,410
Speaker 0: Like if you go to a shitty school, it'll hurt like in the middle of nowhere.

628
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:36,119
Speaker 0: How are you gonna learn how to drive?

629
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,069
Speaker 0: Well, like how do you have time for that?

630
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:41,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you still need to drive much going on with the car department.

631
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:44,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm at the insurance department Yeah, but I was mad.

632
00:45:44,595 --> 00:46:01,003
Speaker 0: the thing I was mad about and I'm still kind of mad about it is the lack of significant consequences for the people who cause damage with their cars and the fact that Everyone has to have insurance and we kind of just paper it over by just having you know fault insurance and kind of.

633
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:10,790
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the the last insurance I want to talk about are these Insurances that I've looked into frequently, but never actually purchased.

634
00:46:11,757 --> 00:46:16,022
Speaker 1: And so these are basically these niche Insurances for like specialties, right?

635
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,490
Speaker 1: So I looked at bicycle insurance.

636
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:23,190
Speaker 1: I've looked at camera insurance because our cameras aren't like mega expensive, but they're not mega cheap either.

637
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:26,710
Speaker 0: I paid for the insurance for my camera and that paid out dividend.

638
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:30,950
Speaker 1: You're just talking about the be like the warranty stuff, right?

639
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,972
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm talking about like an actual insurance plan with a premium that you keep paying yearly.

640
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:41,368
Speaker 0: I did look into one of those and the reason I didn't do it was very specific the cost of the like.

641
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:42,790
Speaker 0: I Forget what it was called.

642
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,470
Speaker 0: It wasn't because they had like a studio one for I forget even who I looked at.

643
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,148
Speaker 0: This was years ago.

644
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:54,630
Speaker 0: If you have a studio and your cameras tend to stay in the studio You can get a pretty cheap insurance that'll cover any accidents that happen to the cameras in the studio.

645
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:58,745
Speaker 0: But if you're carrying the camera around outside the studio, they wouldn't cover it.

646
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:00,110
Speaker 0: You have to go get a different kind of insurance.

647
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:06,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah But I'm saying like these are specialty insurances for special kinds of expensive stuff you might have.

648
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:10,201
Speaker 1: Right, and the thing is it's like I kind of want bike insurance.

649
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:11,064
Speaker 1: I'm in New York City.

650
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:12,990
Speaker 1: My bikes aren't mega expensive.

651
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:15,079
Speaker 1: I've seen you know, but they're not super.

652
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,690
Speaker 0: but my renters insurance covers that my bike.

653
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:20,138
Speaker 1: It covers some things but doesn't cover everything.

654
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:21,523
Speaker 0: if my bike stolen it covers it.

655
00:47:21,563 --> 00:47:23,650
Speaker 0: That's really the only thing I'm actually worried about.

656
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:28,125
Speaker 1: Sometimes depends on the exact circumstances and such right.

657
00:47:28,447 --> 00:47:32,210
Speaker 1: but You know, so I was like, hey, why don't I get some extra bike insurance?

658
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,625
Speaker 1: That way I can like lock my bike up outside without even giving a shit.

659
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,859
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah Cuz that's you know, we didn't talk about this in the beginning.

660
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:44,389
Speaker 0: That's it's not just that you're mitigating your risk It's also that now it's something you don't have to worry about it.

661
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,450
Speaker 1: Right the people who buy insurance who don't file a claim are buying peace of mind.

662
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,032
Speaker 1: Yep, so I was trying to buy peace of mind to say oh if my bike gets stolen Whatever.

663
00:47:53,153 --> 00:48:00,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, and because there were because normally if you get like I claimed on renters insurance once they give you the current value of The stuff you lost.

664
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,899
Speaker 1: so I had an old TV.

665
00:48:01,919 --> 00:48:02,442
Speaker 1: It's like alright.

666
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,290
Speaker 1: Well, here's what the old TV is worth.

667
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:07,770
Speaker 1: You can't necessarily buy that same TV with that money.

668
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:14,529
Speaker 1: Yeah I've seen bike insurances that will give you what it costs to buy that bike when you bought it.

669
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:17,198
Speaker 1: So you would get your bike when it was new.

670
00:48:17,258 --> 00:48:20,690
Speaker 1: you would not get like oh some depreciated value amount of money.

671
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,110
Speaker 0: But doesn't that create a perverse incentive to trash your own bike to get a new one?

672
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,309
Speaker 1: You don't commit insurance fraud or else the master Keaton will come after ya.

673
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:32,547
Speaker 1: but anyway, so I looked at that insurance and it was actually a good deal.

674
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:47,026
Speaker 1: if You were professional and you had super expensive bikes and you raced bikes my level of bike is like too Expensive to leave on the street but not expensive enough to be worth buying insurance.

675
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,450
Speaker 1: the same thing for my cameras, right?

676
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:51,250
Speaker 1: I'm not a TV station with a pile of expensive cameras.

677
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:52,035
Speaker 1: I have it like.

678
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,390
Speaker 1: I have more expensive cameras than the average person.

679
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,463
Speaker 1: So the camera insurance wasn't quite worth it.

680
00:48:57,544 --> 00:48:58,910
Speaker 1: The premiums are too high.

681
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:06,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, my my most expensive camera is like three grand like okay that is not expensive by professional camera standards at all.

682
00:49:07,105 --> 00:49:17,370
Speaker 0: and to like the Warranty insurance like the what do you bought it on Amazon like paying the hundred bucks or whatever was Way cheaper than the premiums on camera insurance, right?

683
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:28,810
Speaker 1: so that while the insurance company would be happy to have me join the insurance pool and help them pay for When a TV studio loses all its cameras and an earthquake you wouldn't get much out of it, right?

684
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:39,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I had to file a claim it's like well I could have just taken the money I spent on premiums put it in a savings account even with no interest and Been able to buy all new camera stuff, right?

685
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:49,874
Speaker 1: So the premiums you're paying have to be small enough That you're pert that they're less than the amount of stuff you're protecting the only exotic insurance I ever actually got.

686
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:50,718
Speaker 0: but my parents got it.

687
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:51,802
Speaker 0: I didn't get it as a kid.

688
00:49:52,324 --> 00:50:00,643
Speaker 0: I actually had an insurance policy specific to my fancy trumpet Mm-hmm because that was at the until I bought a car.

689
00:50:00,703 --> 00:50:02,970
Speaker 0: that was the most expensive really cheap insurance though.

690
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:03,954
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it was.

691
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:06,784
Speaker 0: the premiums were like $15 a year.

692
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:06,884
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:13,481
Speaker 0: Yeah one of those It insured up to like $5,000 worth of trumpet related damages.

694
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:15,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen a lot of musical instrument insurance.

695
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:24,171
Speaker 1: It's especially because you know, some people have like, you know, not only is the musical instrument like their life leehood But it's irreplaceable Right.

696
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:30,629
Speaker 0: Some of them are irreplaceable and some of them aren't or some of them just I was watching a video recently on like how to repair a damaged violin.

697
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:39,969
Speaker 0: basically, the answer is there's a handful of people who are extremely skilled and cost basically an infinite amount of Money to even talk to right.

698
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,270
Speaker 1: So if you have a violin that needs one of those people you better have insurance.

699
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,257
Speaker 1: You'll pay for one of those people or be rich.

700
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:47,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, even if you're rich the insurance can make sense.

701
00:50:47,606 --> 00:50:48,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

702
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:54,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the last insurance that people think about that's a little different is life insurance.

703
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,288
Speaker 0: Yep, I've got some life insurance.

704
00:50:57,853 --> 00:51:00,369
Speaker 0: That's that's peace of mind for the people around you.

705
00:51:00,993 --> 00:51:03,450
Speaker 0: But I don't want to get too deep into the weeds on this like right.

706
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:11,129
Speaker 1: The only thing with life insurance that makes it weird right is that you buy life insurance on Yourself, right?

707
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,810
Speaker 1: So normally all these other insurances you're paying to cancel out your own risk.

708
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:18,302
Speaker 1: And then when you file a claim you get money.

709
00:51:18,805 --> 00:51:27,597
Speaker 1: with life insurance you're buying it you're betting that you will die and The payout goes to someone else.

710
00:51:27,637 --> 00:51:31,309
Speaker 1: You're protecting someone else's risk in the case that something happens to you.

711
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:33,157
Speaker 1: No one else's.

712
00:51:33,197 --> 00:51:35,670
Speaker 1: I'm not you know, you're not buying life insurance on me.

713
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:39,664
Speaker 1: I'm not buying life insurance on you, but maybe I should if you know.

714
00:51:39,684 --> 00:51:41,049
Speaker 0: key though a company's.

715
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,909
Speaker 0: It's not that uncommon for companies to have life insurance on their key employees.

716
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:55,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, well companies buying insurance against the super valuable employee will often restrict that employee from engaging in different behaviors in their micro hoolick and the.

717
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:57,762
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to own a motorcycle clause.

718
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:00,516
Speaker 1: Well, I'm saying like professional athletes It's like they.

719
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:09,256
Speaker 1: often professional athletes won't obey the rules But you know the the sports team will be like in their contract with the player is like hey You can't do all these crazy things.

720
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:12,269

724
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:24,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and maybe they'll have insurance to cover that.

725
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,684
Speaker 1: in case you know insurance.

726
00:52:25,845 --> 00:52:36,130
Speaker 1: if the player gets her insurance If the player does something stupid and breaks the contract right protect We need protection because we just gave this guy a deal for 200 million dollars to play baseball.
