1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,566
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 15th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,428
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:13,069
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,934
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,560
Speaker 0: Tonight, do you have the Buddha nature?

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,219
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,860
Speaker 0: So I've been a pretty hardcore biker like my whole life.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,750
Speaker 0: Like I've had, you know, from when I was a pretty young kid I got a real like 10-speed bike and then I got a mountain bike and I've been mountain biking and trail riding.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,976
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, relatively hardcore, right?

10
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:41,770
Speaker 1: Because actually hardcore are those guys with the Lance Armstrong get-ups, right?

11
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:46,321
Speaker 0: Well, Scott, there's other kinds of hardcore.

12
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:51,717
Speaker 0: I mean, there's also the like hardcore like trick biker on those BMX's but it's almost like totally different class.

13
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:52,560
Speaker 0: Like you have to diverge.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,037
Speaker 0: You can't be hardcore Lance Armstrong and hardcore like downhill mountain biker.

15
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,321
Speaker 1: There are guys who are but...

16
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:00,384
Speaker 0: name one.

17
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:00,725
Speaker 0: Who?

18
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,390
Speaker 1: I'm sure there has to be somebody.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,708
Speaker 1: Right, but the point is, you know, we're like a step under that.

20
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:12,190
Speaker 1: Regardless of your direction, there's the matter of degree of hardcoreness.

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,950
Speaker 0: I'm just saying relative to most people, like from a young age...

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,450
Speaker 1: You are hard, yes, we are both harder core than the vast majority of people.

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'm a lot harder core than you.

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,490
Speaker 0: Yeah.

25
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:27,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I've been like I've been biking a lot.

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,070
Speaker 0: Like I used to go biking, like mountain biking, almost every day after school and like middle school and high school.

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,150
Speaker 1: In what mountains and flat as Detroit?

28
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:39,710
Speaker 0: Mountain biking also refers to like single track and track technical and trail riding and all that stuff.

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,094
Speaker 1: Where were there?

30
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,369
Speaker 1: What tracks are you riding on?

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:47,870
Speaker 0: You realize there's tracks in most of the woods and I didn't actually live in downtown Detroit by the time I was in middle school.

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,250
Speaker 0: I lived in New Baltimore and then Sterling Heights where there's tons of single track trails.

33
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,733
Speaker 0: But one thing, like trail and mountain biking, I never like.

34
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:07,450
Speaker 0: I knew there were clips, like toe clips, and I knew there were you know pedals that had built in clips, but I didn't know what that all was because I never did, like I never had a road bike or a street bike.

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,009
Speaker 1: Because you weren't maximum hard core.

36
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:14,770
Speaker 0: Well no, because I only did like trail riding and mountain biking and stuff, so I only had a mountain bike.

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,649
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure mountain bike guys have that too.

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, so back then, basically all the people I rode with, none of them used that stuff because the people who taught me were like, "No, it's too dangerous.

39
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,003
Speaker 0: You're better off just going for it.

40
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:26,988
Speaker 0: You only need those if you're...".

41
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,697
Speaker 0: And they'd all list like a different list of reasons.

42
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:33,989
Speaker 0: you'd need clips or clipless, but their lists never matched up.

43
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:41,850
Speaker 0: And I never really did like hardcore downhill, which is kind of separate, so I didn't really need like those special bikes or anything.

44
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,449
Speaker 0: I always preferred like, you know, a hardtail mountain bike.

45
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,029
Speaker 0: But, so clips never really factored in.

46
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:55,270
Speaker 0: But now that I moved to the city, you know, I got my first street bike and I've been riding on streets and roads as opposed to in the woods.

47
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,730
Speaker 0: And it's a way different ballgame.

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,789
Speaker 0: Like it took me a while to get used to not having a suspension, though I kind of like how much faster I can go.

49
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:10,790
Speaker 0: But I took the plunge and I got some clipless like SPD pedals and I got the fancy shoes and all that stuff and got them installed.

50
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:17,667
Speaker 0: And pretty much everyone on the internet and even in the bike shop, they're like, "Yeah, you're going to fall over at least like two times before you figure it

51
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:17,868
Speaker 0: out.".

52
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:19,770
Speaker 0: I haven't fallen over yet.

53
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't imagine you would fall over.

54
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,221
Speaker 0: So here's what they say.

55
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,914
Speaker 1: You might be like,

56
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:25,357
Speaker 1: "Oops!"

57
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,050
Speaker 1: and stop and stand on the ground.

58
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,385
Speaker 0: No, so stand on the ground.

59
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:29,990
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

60
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,710
Speaker 0: Apparently what happens to most people when they use these sort of like clipless systems for the first time.

61
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,670
Speaker 1: They get them both clipped in and they can't unclip and then they just fall over.

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,989
Speaker 0: No, you forget to unclip right away.

63
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,025
Speaker 0: Like you don't have the instinct of unclip before you come up to like a stop sign or like.

64
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:48,670
Speaker 0: basically you get this instinct of whenever there's possibly trouble, you unclip a foot to be ready.

65
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,489
Speaker 0: But if you don't have that instinct, like say you're riding, right?

66
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,949
Speaker 0: And say you suddenly come to a stop or you just come to a stop and you weren't really thinking about it.

67
00:03:56,792 --> 00:04:06,010
Speaker 0: If you're clipped in and you lose all forward momentum, it is too late to continue pedaling and usually it's too late to actually clip out in time.

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:18,790
Speaker 0: And what one website described, the exact words were, You will have what I can only refer to as the most ungraceful and doofy looking accident anyone will ever see.

69
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:28,850
Speaker 0: To the outsider, it will appear as though you are falling over in slow motion due to your own stupidity, when in fact there is nothing in the world you could do to arrest your fall.

70
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,970
Speaker 1: I can definitely imagine both seeing this thing from seeing someone else do this and also being victim of it.

71
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,590
Speaker 1: I can imagine it in its fullness.

72
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,173
Speaker 0: It almost happened once where I was stopping and I was almost at a stop and I was thinking like, "Gonna unclip, gonna

73
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:43,695
Speaker 0: unclip.".

74
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:46,705
Speaker 0: But I was also thinking, "I can kinda wait.

75
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,488
Speaker 0: I think I got

76
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:47,749
Speaker 0: this.".

77
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,370
Speaker 0: And then I came to a complete stop and I started to unclip and I couldn't get it out right away.

78
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,049
Speaker 0: And I started to lean a little bit and then I felt it.

79
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,210
Speaker 0: And once you're falling over and you are clipped in, you're fucked.

80
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:01,890
Speaker 0: Too late.

81
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,689
Speaker 0: No, I got my foot out and I still...

82
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,879
Speaker 1: Beyond the point of no return.

83
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,110
Speaker 1: The center of gravity is open.

84
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,932
Speaker 0: I got my foot out.

85
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:12,830
Speaker 0: I was like one degree to the right from being past that event horizon and being that guy.

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,487
Speaker 0: But even the bike shop guy was like, "Yeah, you're gonna fall over a

87
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:15,709
Speaker 0: bunch.".

88
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,650
Speaker 0: But so far I haven't and I'm really proud of that.

89
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,470
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, right, is I know for a fact that if I got that, I would be so conscious of it.

90
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,250
Speaker 1: Like it would be, you know, I would be paying attention to it so much.

91
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,407
Speaker 1: I might get into an accident from something else, right?

92
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,009
Speaker 1: Like I'd be paying attention, like my feet are attached.

93
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:35,150
Speaker 1: I'd just bump into a car, who knows what, or get doored or whatever, right?

94
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:40,710
Speaker 1: But I would be so conscious of it early on that I wouldn't fuck it up because I'd be so much paying attention to it.

95
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:47,990
Speaker 1: And then after that period of so much paying attention to it, it would become reflex before I would stop paying attention to it.

96
00:05:48,311 --> 00:06:00,870
Speaker 1: So the only risk is if there's an in-between period where I'm not... It's not quite 100% motor reflex yet, but I've done it enough that I'm not super paying attention to it all the time.

97
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:01,263
Speaker 1: Yep.

98
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,668
Speaker 1: And that's the danger zone.

99
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,467
Speaker 0: Now I do.

100
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,027
Speaker 1: Not when you're first using it, but when you're sort of getting used to it, but not 100% yet.

101
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,950
Speaker 0: I would recommend getting them because now that I'm riding with them, and I was using toe clips before, and even that was a huge improvement.

102
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,329
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan of toe clips.

103
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:15,948
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

104
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,790
Speaker 0: Toe clips, one, when I was a punk kid, too, I couldn't afford like a clipless system.

105
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,989
Speaker 0: Also, that was, you know, 20 years ago when I started doing this stuff.

106
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,630
Speaker 0: But toe clips, mountain biking, are a death warrant.

107
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,730
Speaker 1: I think they're a death warrant, period.

108
00:06:30,312 --> 00:06:32,209
Speaker 1: I've been using them in the city up to this point.

109
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,489
Speaker 1: If you see track biking, they're okay.

110
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:33,963
Speaker 0: No!

111
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,208
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no.

112
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,506
Speaker 0: They're okay in the city, I would say.

113
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,709
Speaker 0: They're not okay in the woods because, one, if you...

114
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,210
Speaker 1: I mean, in the velodrome, they're okay.

115
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:42,950
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

116
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when I think track, I think like single track, like, you know, those two inch trails in the woods.

117
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,310
Speaker 1: I'm saying on the circle where the guys are trying to not go on their fixies.

118
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kind of biking I would do.

119
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,290
Speaker 0: That's track biking.

120
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,948
Speaker 0: Like in the woods?

121
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:56,650
Speaker 0: All right, so I pull my foot out of the toe clip, and I ride on the back.

122
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,430
Speaker 0: Now I've got this basket that's just waiting to catch a tree.

123
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,169
Speaker 1: Exactly.

124
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:06,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like night and day in terms of like speed.

125
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,589
Speaker 1: I tire myself out faster.

126
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,210
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, you know that your foot is always in the right spot.

127
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:10,542
Speaker 0: Yup.

128
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,570
Speaker 1: You also, when you're biking, you're forced to pull up, right?

129
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,648
Speaker 1: You don't have to like, you know, bend and sort of curve your foot to sort of get some pulling up going on.

130
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:22,929
Speaker 1: So that muscle that does the up pulling is now getting worked all the time as you're pedaling.

131
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:24,450
Speaker 1: And you're going way faster.

132
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,685
Speaker 0: I find I tire faster, but I'm going a lot faster while I'm tiring faster, and it's a net gain.

133
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:34,010
Speaker 1: I would get them, but I would only get them if I had the fancy kind of road bike.

134
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:36,190
Speaker 1: I wouldn't put them on a non-road bike.

135
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,770
Speaker 0: Just get them, and you can just take pedals off.

136
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,889
Speaker 0: Like I got my old pedals.

137
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,910
Speaker 0: You can just swap pedals between bikes.

138
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:44,989
Speaker 1: I still, I don't think it's worth it.

139
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,230
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like, yeah, it's like putting a big fancy engine in sort of a boring car.

140
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,690
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm thinking about getting them for my old mountain bike now.

141
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not doing it.

142
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,610
Speaker 0: Well, you don't have an old mountain bike.

143
00:07:55,871 --> 00:08:03,870
Speaker 1: Even if I did, I would only get them if I had, you know, the, the, you know, the road Tour de France style hooked handlebar lean forward kind of bike.

144
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,310
Speaker 1: Then I would absolutely get them.

145
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:05,750
Speaker 1: No question.

146
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,909
Speaker 0: The other big thing they save you from that I have never done to myself, but I might get that kind of bike.

147
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:12,790
Speaker 0: Do it is mountain biking.

148
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:24,949
Speaker 0: If you're going like long distance, like an overland, like this long thing, you get kind of fatigued and it's really easy to just kind of be tired when you're like going on a straightaway and your foot will just like slip off the pedal right into the wheel at the back.

149
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:26,249
Speaker 1: That never happens to me.

150
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you haven't tried riding like if you ride a very long distance, it's actually a fairly common accident to happen.

151
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,767
Speaker 0: And clipless systems prevent that.

152
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,129
Speaker 0: So I'm digging these things.

153
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:38,390
Speaker 0: That's all I can say about it.

154
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,370
Speaker 0: I didn't get multi-release because research said that that's basically stupid.

155
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,429
Speaker 1: What is multi-release?

156
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,910
Speaker 0: So you can unclip.

157
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,190
Speaker 1: Do you unclip by twisting your kicking your heel out to the side?

158
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,430
Speaker 0: Out to the left or right.

159
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,750
Speaker 1: So away from the bike.

160
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:53,889
Speaker 0: Multi-release.

161
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,889
Speaker 1: You don't kick your heel towards the bike.

162
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,430
Speaker 0: Multi-release.

163
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:02,209
Speaker 0: You can clip in both directions or you can do a maneuver to clip straight up, but you have to use enough force to get off.

164
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,569
Speaker 0: So it gives you more options out.

165
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:04,544
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:08,830
Speaker 0: Multi-release appears to be used more for mountain biking kind of clips.

167
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:09,810
Speaker 0: And there's all these.

168
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,090
Speaker 0: I learned a whole bunch about this stuff.

169
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,629
Speaker 1: I did my research.

170
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,409
Speaker 1: I researched it as well.

171
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,209
Speaker 1: There's the kind, the SPD is pretty much the one to get.

172
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:15,550
Speaker 1: Yeah.

173
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,210
Speaker 1: Don't get anything else.

174
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,289
Speaker 1: That's the one that built that they can, you can put that on any normal shoe.

175
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,290
Speaker 1: Well, any, there's like a, you know, normal looking shoes, right?

176
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:29,510
Speaker 1: Like they have dress shoes that have SPD brackets on them and you can actually walk around right with an SPD clip in the shoe.

177
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:39,310
Speaker 1: If the shoe has enough soul that it goes lower than the clip, which is a lot, you know, you could also get one where the clip sort of sticks out a little bit and you can't walk around too much, but you can still kind of walk around.

178
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:39,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

179
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,110
Speaker 0: For my kind of riding, those are stupid.

180
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,810
Speaker 1: But there's the non SPD one.

181
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,470
Speaker 1: Well, there's like a big bracket.

182
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,488
Speaker 1: There's a couple of old ones.

183
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,626
Speaker 1: I see guys in the city with these, so they have these giant brackets on the bottom of the shoe.

184
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,046
Speaker 0: Which says that not only are most other systems worse or dangerous, but many of them are bad for you.

185
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:03,549
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like the old fashioned clipless system is like, there's a gigantic bracket on the bottom of your shoe.

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,770
Speaker 1: You can't really walk at all, you know, and it's a special, it's only on a special shoe.

187
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:10,669
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, who wants that?

188
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,230
Speaker 1: You know, maybe if you still have it from the olden days.

189
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,351
Speaker 1: Well, I

190
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:28,330
Speaker 0: realize the play is important because one used to mountain biking so much, what I realized I do that I never noticed until I started, until I started riding like this is that I tend to twist my, like I stand up a lot and I tend to twist my torso around a lot, like to the side, especially around corners.

191
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,470
Speaker 0: And it's kind of a like mountain bike-y thing that you don't need to do in the city.

192
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,128
Speaker 0: But now that I'm clipped in, like I notice every time I do it, cause my foot can't move that way.

193
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:37,664
Speaker 1: Yup.

194
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:38,287
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,090
Speaker 1: I don't, I try not to stand up unless absolutely necessary.

196
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,350
Speaker 1: Yeah.

197
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,456
Speaker 0: Well it's a different kind of like.

198
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:45,890
Speaker 0: standing up on a mountain bike is basically a suspension if you have a hard tail.

199
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,369
Speaker 1: Like if there's a big hill, I got to downshift so I can stay sitting while going up the hill rather than stand up and go, eh, eh, eh.

200
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,170
Speaker 0: But like, like, you know, mountain biking, you're going over a really rough terrain.

201
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,270
Speaker 0: You stand up to go over the rough terrain.

202
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,570
Speaker 1: Because otherwise the seat is going to kick your ass.

203
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,130
Speaker 0: Unless you have a full suspension.

204
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:03,430
Speaker 0: And I actually still prefer hard tails to full suspensions.

205
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:07,950
Speaker 0: Granted, I don't do, you know, like crazy, like downhill on a ski slope.

206
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,710
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're not the hardest core is what you're saying.

207
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:12,130
Speaker 0: I never said I was the hardest core.

208
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:12,649
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

209
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,070
Speaker 0: I'm a pretty hardcore biker though.

210
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,966
Speaker 1: Okay.

211
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:16,949
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

212
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,689
Speaker 0: It's news day.

213
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:18,343
Speaker 1: News day.

214
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:19,590
Speaker 1: So check this news out.

215
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:28,310
Speaker 1: So Portal 2 is coming out with this thing called Perpetual Testing Initiative, which is a way for you to make your own portal test chambers.

216
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:35,407
Speaker 1: And the thing is, there have been many FPS map makers in the past, all the way back to ZDoom, even Wolfenstein 3D.

217
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,868
Speaker 1: You could make your own maps.

218
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,083
Speaker 0: Yeah.

219
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:43,970
Speaker 1: But when things got 3D, when things got Quake, when things got Half-Life and they had tools like what was it called?

220
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,730
Speaker 1: Hammer or something?

221
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:53,230
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I used to mod the other ever living crap out of like, you know, the unreal maps I had to redo and de-hacked and wadded and all that stuff.

223
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,250
Speaker 1: Even NS2 has some really good map making tools.

224
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:01,470
Speaker 1: But all these tools for making, you know, FPS maps are difficult tools right there.

225
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:05,770
Speaker 1: You have to spend a lot of time learning them and fiddling with them and you learn to apply textures.

226
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:06,630
Speaker 0: Well, here's the difference.

227
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,210
Speaker 0: It took me a few weeks to learn in my spare time to learn how to make like complex Doom maps.

228
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,028
Speaker 0: And this is Doom.

229
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,577
Speaker 0: This isn't real 3D.

230
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,086
Speaker 1: This is Doom.

231
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,489
Speaker 0: And so, but it meant I could casually make mods for Doom and levels for Doom while doing other things.

232
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,090
Speaker 0: But most of the people I know of who make like Half-Life, like Counter-Strike maps.

233
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,588
Speaker 0: That's it.

234
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:30,209
Speaker 0: That is their hobby.

235
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,189
Speaker 0: Singular.

236
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,849
Speaker 1: Because it's, you know, it's all you get so hard.

237
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:35,330
Speaker 1: You have to it's like a whole set.

238
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,894
Speaker 1: You get to get.

239
00:12:35,914 --> 00:12:37,550
Speaker 1: it's why like level editor is a job.

240
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:46,870
Speaker 1: As an aside, if you learn to like make maps for the unreal engine, you got a job for life because, you know, the same way that a guy who learns like AutoCAD is a job for life.

241
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,390
Speaker 1: Anyone who needs someone who can work, you know, I have an aside, Scott, that you'll appreciate.

242
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,410
Speaker 0: We all want to get this out there.

243
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:59,250
Speaker 0: If any of you listeners feel like you could take an old Counter-Strike one six map called CS Thunder.

244
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:02,390
Speaker 0: It's not the one that's called CS Thunder and source.

245
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:04,990
Speaker 0: It doesn't exist in source CS underscore Thunder.

246
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:09,970
Speaker 0: It was perhaps the best Counter-Strike map ever made.

247
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,790
Speaker 1: At least our favorite.

248
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,183
Speaker 0: Yes.

249
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:16,692
Speaker 0: Because it had this great well, I digress as to why I could do a whole show on why that we should get.

250
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:21,625
Speaker 0: make a server that only runs Thunder and the version of one six that supports it is state.

251
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,829
Speaker 0: Oh, it's all assault, which assault is a couple of assaults.

252
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,070
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no, no, not assault, not assault oil rig.

253
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:32,287
Speaker 0: I want I want that APC.

254
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,489
Speaker 0: I want vehicles back.

255
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,130
Speaker 1: What's your mansion?

256
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:44,790
Speaker 1: Jeepathon 2K, Jeepathon 2K, you know, just only the crazy, wait a minute, wait a bit more.

257
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:46,605
Speaker 1: Oh, Arab.

258
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:48,308
Speaker 0: I'll bet.

259
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,889
Speaker 0: You know what?

260
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,830
Speaker 0: I'm going to check after the show because CS one six is played as much as CS source.

261
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,850
Speaker 0: There's got to be a server on a jeepathon.

262
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,629
Speaker 0: And if there is, I'm going to play on it fucking tonight.

263
00:13:58,456 --> 00:13:58,987
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

264
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:00,675
Speaker 0: But I digress.

265
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:04,050
Speaker 0: if you can make that map in CS source or CS go, I'll pay you.

266
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:12,070
Speaker 1: This portal map maker is is looking is so brain dead easy that anyone can do it because it portal only has so many elements, right?

267
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:23,169
Speaker 1: So it's really easy for them to provide you with this other user interface where just sort of you lay tiles, you know, and you put like, OK, a bumper there and a companion cube there and a automatic portal there.

268
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,045
Speaker 1: And, you know, so and to make test chambers, you know, put the exit here, put the entrance here.

269
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,850
Speaker 1: Right.

270
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,430
Speaker 1: They provide an easy user interface to building a test chamber and then it automatically generates the map based on that.

271
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,589
Speaker 0: So I haven't read much about it yet.

272
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,848
Speaker 0: So I have a question for you that I don't know if you can answer because I don't know if it's known.

273
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:44,950
Speaker 0: And I have a a proposal for what I would do making maps if I were a dick.

274
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,529
Speaker 1: Impossible to win maps.

275
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,510
Speaker 0: No, I would make maps that are impossible, but seem so possible.

276
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,550
Speaker 0: So this is like it's your fault that you're not making right.

277
00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,687
Speaker 1: Here's the thing about this is that it's really hard to make a good test chamber.

278
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:06,470
Speaker 1: crazy hard because a good test chamber, right, is one that is possible, right.

279
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:13,110
Speaker 1: But not trivial, but is not obvious either.

280
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,363
Speaker 1: Right.

281
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,028
Speaker 1: It's like Dixie.

282
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,970
Speaker 1: You can't be obvious, but you can't be impossible.

283
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:17,290
Speaker 1: Right.

284
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,569
Speaker 1: You need someone to get.

285
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,930
Speaker 0: I mean, even Portal two sort of suffered, in my opinion, for me as a gamer.

286
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:28,910
Speaker 0: Note, I'm qualifying because parts of the fact that you obvious the whole second half of the game was no thought.

287
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,910
Speaker 0: I'd literally no matter what the puzzle was, I'd ignore the puzzle.

288
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:34,990
Speaker 0: I look around the room and there's any angled surface.

289
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:38,970
Speaker 0: I would assume that was the answer and just accelerate into a portal coming off of that.

290
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,190
Speaker 0: And that always worked right in the co-op.

291
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,406
Speaker 1: I think there was one that took us a little while to figure out.

292
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:52,630
Speaker 1: And the other thing in Portal is in addition to the puzzle solving, there's the acrobatic component, which is like, OK, it's you know what to do, but can you do it?

293
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,090
Speaker 0: There's a third element of timing puzzles.

294
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,790
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

295
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:57,010
Speaker 0: That's the acrobatic component.

296
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,528
Speaker 0: I would say they're separate because there's the acrobatics of for of your own personal timing.

297
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,190
Speaker 0: Like, do I have to, like, fall through multiple portals and shoot somewhere else?

298
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,350
Speaker 1: Shoot the cube, then jump through the portal at the right time and make sure you can make the jump and grab the cube in midair.

299
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,750
Speaker 0: But there's another kind of puzzle.

300
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,310
Speaker 0: Remember those the spheres of light in the Portal one where you might have to time it.

301
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,269
Speaker 0: where it's there's an element independent of you, like a rotating door or something you have to time against.

302
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:24,230
Speaker 1: Right.

303
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,490
Speaker 0: But anyway, I consider them two separate aspects.

304
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:38,938
Speaker 1: The reason there are so few puzzles in Portal one and two is because using only the elements that they had available to them, right, is only it's really hard to come up with another puzzle that's actually good.

305
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,770
Speaker 1: so that they had noticed that as they get later in the game, you know, it's like, why didn't they add another one?

306
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:50,690
Speaker 1: Well, they really couldn't until they introduced the goop and the paint because they ran out of good puzzles using only cubes and buttons.

307
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,329
Speaker 1: So they had to add the paint in there.

308
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:56,550
Speaker 1: And then once they added the paint was like, well, we can only come up with so many using the paint.

309
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,270
Speaker 1: We need to add something else in order to come up with more puzzles.

310
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:11,170
Speaker 1: So using only the elements that currently exist, you know, and having only these amateurs make new test chambers, I am incredibly both skeptical and excited.

311
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:20,829
Speaker 1: I'm excited for I know there's going to be at least a few really good test chambers that come out of this, but I'm skeptical because I know most of the test chambers that come out of this is going to be absolutely worthless.

312
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:28,249
Speaker 0: The other trouble is that easily two thirds of my enjoyment of portal is from the humor, which won't be there in these.

313
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,690
Speaker 1: I mean, unless I think there will be some in like, you know, parts of it, but not really.

314
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,966
Speaker 0: Yeah.

315
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,550
Speaker 0: Like unless I can script like add wave files.

316
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:39,609
Speaker 1: It's like, is it going to let, I don't think it's going to let people make like a whole campaign.

317
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,748
Speaker 1: It's only going to let people make a test chamber and then like share your test chambers with your friends.

318
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,750
Speaker 0: And I'll admit I haven't looked into it at all because I've been busy playing other games.

319
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:57,390
Speaker 0: But what I'm curious if they'll do, because some of the old doom editors had things that would tell you if something was possible or not for a player who wasn't cheating.

320
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,690
Speaker 1: How can something be impossible in doom unless there's like a key door and you haven't put the red key yet.

321
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,570
Speaker 0: You can trivially make things that are impossible to get past.

322
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:07,046
Speaker 1: How so?

323
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:08,650
Speaker 0: Uh, you can make a stairway.

324
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,370
Speaker 0: You just can't go down.

325
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,590
Speaker 0: And that's the only path to the exit.

326
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:11,869
Speaker 1: Yeah.

327
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,310
Speaker 1: But that's just, that's like I said, there's just an obstruction.

328
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,750
Speaker 1: That's it's really easy.

329
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,108
Speaker 0: You could make a lava pit.

330
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,982
Speaker 1: Any basic pathfinding algorithm can determine if it's impossible to get from point A to point B.

331
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,730
Speaker 0: Yes, it's a little complicated though.

332
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,876
Speaker 1: Portal is, is, is.

333
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:31,530
Speaker 1: you can't really have a, you know, a thing that does that because it's like, well, okay, so to get from point A to point B, there's a door that needs to open.

334
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:33,170
Speaker 1: There's a button that controls the door.

335
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,149
Speaker 1: What can push the button?

336
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:41,709
Speaker 1: It would be a ludicrously difficult problem to come up with a program that could determine if a test chamber was solvable.

337
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,373
Speaker 0: Or be much more interesting problem for someone who was interested in this sort of thing to try and solve

338
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:48,035
Speaker 1: because

339
00:18:48,095 --> 00:19:01,330
Speaker 0: the number of elements of harmony are constrained and the physics are very well known and the, you know, there's so many constraints that one, you could come up with a sort of brute force thing that would run around.

340
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:23,429
Speaker 0: Like it spawns a million dudes who go in every possible direction or two, you could have a sort of best guess algorithm that could figure out, I wonder if someone could make a thing for a small map that would be able to determine if it's possible at all or impossible and then a secondary threshold of if it's possible without quote ridiculous timing and or acrobatics.

341
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,850
Speaker 1: I think, you know, my idea, I've got one idea for a chamber, right?

342
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,830
Speaker 1: And basically the idea for this chamber, it's very loose idea.

343
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:35,345
Speaker 1: And I think it's the only hope I have of making a good chamber is you got to open the exit door.

344
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,910
Speaker 1: You also got to get to the exit door, right?

345
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,110
Speaker 1: This is sort of the fundamental thing in portal, right?

346
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:43,826
Speaker 1: So I'm going to make it to where it's sort of obvious.

347
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,628
Speaker 1: you can just go boom, boom, boom, and it'll open the door.

348
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:50,651
Speaker 1: But if you do that obvious way of opening the door, you won't be able to get to the door.

349
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:54,209
Speaker 1: And if you do the obvious way, it'll be really easy to get to the door.

350
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,571
Speaker 1: But if you do that obvious way of getting to the door, you won't be able to open the door.

351
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:04,150
Speaker 1: And there'll be a non obvious way of doing both simultaneously.

352
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:13,409
Speaker 0: I kind of want to go more the route of making something really sort of like puzzle in the sense of find the secret doors.

353
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,615
Speaker 1: Well, that's the other thing.

354
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:25,226
Speaker 1: It's the other idea I had that I realized is kind of a bleh idea because it would be sort of easy is make your test chamber kind of crazy and maze like and like you got to, you know, find the hidden spot.

355
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:26,431
Speaker 1: that doesn't look quite right.

356
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:31,497
Speaker 1: Shoot a portal there, get into the secret porn room, and that's where the cube is that you need to get through that.

357
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:36,149
Speaker 1: You know, so it's like people would just be sitting there like, ah, and eventually find it.

358
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,370
Speaker 0: Well, what I would do is make one like that and then publicize it as the impossible one and dare people to send you a video of them beating it.

359
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,090
Speaker 1: And a guy is going to beat in five seconds.

360
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:44,694
Speaker 0: Oh, exactly.

361
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:48,397
Speaker 1: But because he's going to look at the map file and he's going to say, oh, there's a room there.

362
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's going to look around.

363
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,853
Speaker 1: He's going to see it.

364
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:56,564
Speaker 1: And I mean, if you if I gave that to you, you would find it in like no time because it's not like you can make something.

365
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:58,456
Speaker 1: that's, you know, a completely sealed room.

366
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:58,678
Speaker 1: Right.

367
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,229
Speaker 1: Because there's no way to shoot the portal into it.

368
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:01,013
Speaker 1: Right.

369
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:05,110
Speaker 1: It would have to be, you know, like a far away distant thing that's very tiny.

370
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:08,789
Speaker 1: But you would notice it because you would be like, maybe I'll go the route of making a straight up maze.

371
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, but any maze you would find it by always going left.

372
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,729
Speaker 0: You, Scott, you can construct mazes where that does not work.

373
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:16,973
Speaker 1: Really?

374
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,390
Speaker 0: I could show you some examples.

375
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,969
Speaker 0: There are ways to make mazes where the left or right always rule will trap you in a loop.

376
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:26,129
Speaker 0: that'll never touch the solution.

377
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,329
Speaker 0: It's trivial to make a maze like that.

378
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:40,906
Speaker 1: Maybe you should make a maze like that where the left we're going always left traps you in a loop, going always right, traps you in a loop and, you know, going a certain if you go the right way, which is neither always going left or always should have

379
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:41,852
Speaker 0: said the correct way.

380
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,750
Speaker 1: If you go the correct way, that won't actually bring you to the goal.

381
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,990
Speaker 1: It'll just along that correct path.

382
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:54,710
Speaker 1: There is a spot where you can see a place to portal that will get you to the right spot.

383
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:57,750
Speaker 1: So even and it won't be at the very end of the correct path.

384
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:00,730
Speaker 1: It'll be somewhere else along the correct path.

385
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:02,003
Speaker 1: And you might miss it.

386
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:07,229
Speaker 1: Now you can see why this is difficult, but I'm excited to see what happens with this.

387
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:15,521
Speaker 0: So in other more rumor news, there's an article a while ago that Valve was reportedly working on a steam box game console.

388
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,170
Speaker 1: that's been a rumor for a zillion years.

389
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:27,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there was a recent iteration of it in March and there was another more recent article from April talking about how Valve is straight up trying to hire hardware developers.

390
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:29,443
Speaker 1: Well, they could be making anything.

391
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:30,590
Speaker 0: they could be making anything.

392
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:36,710
Speaker 0: But the second one put forth a wave of speculation speculation.

393
00:22:37,911 --> 00:23:00,870
Speaker 0: So I think it's interesting because Valve is one of the few companies like I can count on one hand the number of companies in the world that I generally trust to do the things I want personally and have, if not my own best interest in mind, at least a personal self-serving interest that will also serve my own personal interests.

394
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,431
Speaker 1: That's right.

395
00:23:02,234 --> 00:23:06,952
Speaker 0: Valve also is a pretty great company, it appears in light of their employee handbook.

396
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently there was a small interview with Gabe Newell.

397
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:19,490
Speaker 1: He and in that interview, he, A, basically admitted that that policy of the flat company was a direct reaction to his time at Microsoft.

398
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,574
Speaker 1: He wanted to do the opposite.

399
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:24,870
Speaker 1: And B, he 100 percent just said he likes My Little Pony.

400
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,696
Speaker 1: Friendship is Magic.

401
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:27,670
Speaker 0: That's a good sign of a good person.

402
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,808
Speaker 1: Because we knew that for a while, but he just said it straight up.

403
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,452
Speaker 1: So there you go.

404
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:41,710
Speaker 0: So all this together, I want to just kind of take an aside to talk about something that I'd said a long time ago on the show, like many years ago.

405
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:50,850
Speaker 0: But I think the consoles as we know them today have to die and it won't be that long.

406
00:23:51,251 --> 00:24:05,370
Speaker 0: Well, but the thing is, the reason it might not happen is that Microsoft actually holds all the cards here, not so much the other console developers and not so much people like Valve, because Valve could make their own thing.

407
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,313
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the rumor was Valve is going to make a set top box, which would be great.

408
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,207
Speaker 0: Valve should do something like that.

409
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:12,698
Speaker 1: Maybe.

410
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:13,447
Speaker 0: I think so.

411
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:28,630
Speaker 0: But Microsoft is the one who way back before the Xbox even was saying that they wanted to make video game consoles be a commodity hardware because they thought they would all run Windows, which Windows is still really the only way to play games right now.

412
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,131
Speaker 1: That's right.

413
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:33,650
Speaker 0: But so Microsoft had a vested interest in that.

414
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:39,275
Speaker 0: And everyone who plays games called the idiots and like really defended the virtues of consoles.

415
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:40,790
Speaker 0: Now, Microsoft is trying to be evil.

416
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,509
Speaker 0: And it was this whole stupid argument.

417
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,210
Speaker 0: PlayStation, I don't see any future for their hardware.

418
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,390
Speaker 1: Nintendo is not in this country.

419
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,050
Speaker 0: Nintendo posted losses like big losses.

420
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,010
Speaker 0: Nintendo's run into a lot of trouble.

421
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:07,710
Speaker 1: I heard a rumor that Nintendo and also sort of based on information from like a Nintendo financial report or something or quarterly report that they're actually going to bring that they've been selling the 3DS like a low price and they're going to bring the price back up.

422
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,078
Speaker 0: I saw that rumor.

423
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:10,350
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll actually happen.

424
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,808
Speaker 1: That is crazy.

425
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,941
Speaker 1: Bringing the price up.

426
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,190
Speaker 0: It's like, whoa, we could do a show on Nintendo.

427
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:18,894
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

428
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:23,770
Speaker 1: The thing is, like, you know, Scott, remember Geek Night circa 2005.

429
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:30,870
Speaker 0: I remember we did a show and then we said, yeah, we're like, Nintendo is the champion of everything at the time.

430
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:31,395
Speaker 1: It was true.

431
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:32,829
Speaker 0: PC gaming is dead.

432
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:35,490
Speaker 1: It was at the time very dying.

433
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,789
Speaker 0: Let's see what was going on at the time.

434
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:37,577
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

435
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,390
Speaker 0: Game Cube.

436
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:39,373
Speaker 1: Yeah.

437
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:42,790
Speaker 1: You know, we was coming and we actually believed it was going to be revolution.

438
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,870
Speaker 1: The DS was the king of everything.

439
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,773
Speaker 0: But it's an aside.

440
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:46,415
Speaker 0: Nintendo.

441
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:59,170
Speaker 0: basically, to avoid doing an entire show on this, Nintendo turned its back on the so-called, I hate this term because it's a useless term, but the hardcore gamers, like super serial gamers like us.

442
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,833
Speaker 1: The thing is, Nintendo, if they would just change their ways, they could reconquer the world so fast.

443
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,742
Speaker 1: All they just do is be like, Pokemon MMO, right?

444
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,710
Speaker 1: That's number one, right?

445
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,910
Speaker 0: Number one, that would do it.

446
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,110
Speaker 0: They could make a company that was just the Pokemon MMO.

447
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,615
Speaker 0: They already do.

448
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:14,910
Speaker 1: It's called the Pokemon Corporation.

449
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that company made the MMO.

450
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,673
Speaker 1: But number two, just open up, be like, hey, anyone who wants to can make games for Nintendo systems.

451
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:25,170
Speaker 1: We're removing all our DRMs, indie developers.

452
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,082
Speaker 1: We don't care who it is.

453
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,609
Speaker 1: Anyone who wants to can make a Nintendo game.

454
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,949
Speaker 0: It couldn't be just that anymore.

455
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:39,550
Speaker 0: So Nintendo turned its back on the Four Swords, Crystal Chronicles, experimental hardware, Game Boy, Link Cube stuff to target.

456
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,110
Speaker 1: Well, they want to do the Wii U, which is going back to that.

457
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:48,948
Speaker 0: Let me finish, to target the Blue Ocean, which was so-called, again, terrible term, casual gamers and mommies and all that.

458
00:26:49,670 --> 00:27:01,550
Speaker 0: But they targeted them by still selling them expensive games, which was also where all the money was on the DS and the Game Boy Advance and everything.

459
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:09,310
Speaker 0: But that meant that the next wave of gaming, like smartphones and Angry Birds, is they're.

460
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:11,369
Speaker 0: basically they did the thing that you should never do.

461
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:14,689
Speaker 0: They went toe to toe with the dollar games.

462
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,710
Speaker 0: We used to say, yeah, Zynga, that doesn't compete with, you know, what we consider games.

463
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:20,610
Speaker 0: They're barely a game company.

464
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,427
Speaker 1: Nintendo is trying to sell you Angry Birds for 50 bucks.

465
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,327
Speaker 1: It's not going to work.

466
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,770
Speaker 0: Yeah.

467
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:39,035
Speaker 0: So Nintendo basically went after a demographic and then got creamed in that demographic while simultaneously literally abandoning the people who would give them hundreds of dollars sight unseen for a console that might fail, that has one game available.

468
00:27:39,055 --> 00:27:40,930
Speaker 0: I bought the DS.

469
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,390
Speaker 0: Literally knowing nothing about it, day one.

470
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,129
Speaker 1: Well, we had the Virtual Boy strategy.

471
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:46,891
Speaker 1: Yeah.

472
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:53,329
Speaker 1: The thing is, I'm actually there's enough games in the 3DS that it's almost something I want to wait for the 3DS Lite for.

473
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:53,871
Speaker 0: Right.

474
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:57,750
Speaker 1: But even then, it's like I have so many games already.

475
00:27:58,853 --> 00:27:58,913
Speaker 1: Why?

476
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:03,550
Speaker 1: You know, it's like even though there's some games in the 3DS I kind of want and they're supposed to be like a Phoenix, right?

477
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,769
Speaker 1: That's going to be 3DS only and stuff like that.

478
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:14,762
Speaker 1: It's like even though there's maybe enough games in there, the cost of it, even at the low price now, is not worth it.

479
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,750
Speaker 1: They have to pump it up so much more to make me pay for it.

480
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:30,447
Speaker 0: But for Nintendo, it's not just open up, but it's open up with what the GameCube had, have hardware like the Game Boy Link thing or connecting 3DS's to a Wii.

481
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,491
Speaker 0: Right.

482
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:33,200
Speaker 1: Because nobody is if I'm.

483
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:41,205
Speaker 1: if I'm developing a game and I can develop a game for any platform I want, why would I even if Nintendo is open and will let any game go in the store.

484
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:41,610
Speaker 1: Right.

485
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:50,010
Speaker 1: Why would I go on and why would I spend all this time, you know, learning Nintendo's platform when I can just make an XNA kind of game or a Valve game?

486
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:58,030
Speaker 1: The only reason I would do it is because the Nintendo platform has stuff, has hardware, has accessories, has things that no other platform has.

487
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:08,757
Speaker 0: I mean, like Crystal Chronicles and Four Swords were like this amazing new concept and they made some demos like, hey, look what you could do and make a game for Nintendo if it meant that I can make a game.

488
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:23,289
Speaker 1: that was not possible in any other platform, because I know that every single person who has that platform has these particular accessories that go with it, like the Wii U with its extra screens or the 3DS with its 3D or the DS with its two screens and touching.

489
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,096
Speaker 1: Right.

490
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:25,890
Speaker 1: And that's the only that's the thing.

491
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:32,867
Speaker 1: So if they opened up, they would attract developers for those reasons, because I could make a game on the PC.

492
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:33,030
Speaker 1: Sure.

493
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,516
Speaker 1: But you can't make a game on the PC.

494
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:37,410
Speaker 1: that is 4DS is attached to the television.

495
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:41,569
Speaker 1: So if you got an idea for a game like that, well, Nintendo's the only game in town.

496
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:47,940
Speaker 0: But now this won't happen because there are, you know, there's those Japanese and stubborn.

497
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:48,289
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

498
00:29:48,490 --> 00:30:08,410
Speaker 0: Even my thing of if Microsoft pushed it and worked with Valve straight up and they actually not going to have put aside corporate bureaucracy, they could, I think, literally destroy the console market to the point that commodity hardware gets released every five years.

499
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,129
Speaker 0: That is just, you know, this is the spec.

500
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:20,090
Speaker 0: If you have the spec, any game for this, you know, joint valve XA, whatever venture will run on it with guaranteed performance.

501
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:24,367
Speaker 0: And then I mean, I would just have that instead of my HDPC.

502
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:25,651
Speaker 1: Yeah.

503
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:31,015
Speaker 1: The thing is, you get all those, you know, things with, you know, all the pitfalls of PC gaming.

504
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:31,277
Speaker 1: Right.

505
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:32,830
Speaker 1: Whereas that we have no problem PC gaming.

506
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,333
Speaker 1: Right.

507
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:36,030
Speaker 0: But the reference, most people out there.

508
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:36,476
Speaker 1: Right.

509
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:37,510
Speaker 1: Even look at Penny Arcade.

510
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:38,849
Speaker 1: Those guys play a lot of games.

511
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:43,350
Speaker 1: Every time my game goes to play a PC game, he's like, oh, I got PC gaming.

512
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,995
Speaker 1: It didn't work.

513
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:45,830
Speaker 1: Video card driver display.

514
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,913
Speaker 0: But then again, this is why, you know, the valve set top box would be such an interesting idea.

515
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:53,450
Speaker 0: Well, not interesting because people have tried this before.

516
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:56,910
Speaker 0: They failed because they weren't valve and or Microsoft.

517
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:57,999
Speaker 1: They were.

518
00:30:58,302 --> 00:30:58,969
Speaker 1: What was it called?

519
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,471
Speaker 1: Phantom.

520
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,860
Speaker 0: I'm thinking even older than that, there are a lot of companies that tried to market PCs designed for gaming.

521
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:09,230
Speaker 0: that were black boxes that you connected to a TV and they were just all disasters.

522
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:18,324
Speaker 0: But the idea of having reference hardware that you would get a seal of approval like this is certified to run valve series 2012 games.

523
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:23,890
Speaker 0: And when you make a game, you could certify it for that reference hardware.

524
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,736
Speaker 0: But I digress.

525
00:31:25,937 --> 00:31:28,010
Speaker 0: That's a whole but all that stuff is kind of too good.

526
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,369
Speaker 1: The problem isn't necessarily your hardware requirements.

527
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:36,689
Speaker 1: Mostly the problem is, you know, your software, because you're running just Windows, you fuck it up because you're a fuckhead.

528
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,070
Speaker 1: That's why either you installed some stupid shit on there and now your games don't.

529
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:54,454
Speaker 0: That's why either valve makes, you know, a set top box that is semi locked down or at you don't know what everyone cracks it because they want to pirate and or steal and or cheat.

530
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,009
Speaker 1: And now everyone's fucked up.

531
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,955
Speaker 0: No, because if they crack it, the people who crack that stuff are the people who don't have problems.

532
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:01,962
Speaker 0: No, no, it's the opposite.

533
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,909
Speaker 1: The people who crack everything and the people the most problems because they cause the problems by cracking and then they complain that it broke because they cracked it.

534
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:23,303
Speaker 0: Most of the people who complain about PC gaming that I run into either are unrelatedly doofuses running like the obviously Trojaned like Photoshop, the obviously Trojaned, you know, pirate hacks.

535
00:32:23,363 --> 00:32:25,552
Speaker 1: I downloaded that because I was too dumb.

536
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,949
Speaker 0: Anyway, they they can handle that, I think.

537
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:31,669
Speaker 0: But to Microsoft could push it.

538
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:37,786
Speaker 0: But I I don't know what Valve is actually doing because they haven't said.

539
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,790
Speaker 0: all we know is they're looking at hardware.

540
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:42,889
Speaker 1: Hopefully they're going to make some control.

541
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:46,930
Speaker 0: When's that D-pad patent expire?

542
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:48,356
Speaker 1: I think it did.

543
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:50,730
Speaker 1: Just people don't make D-pads.

544
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,391
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

545
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:59,560
Speaker 0: But anyway, briefly, things of the day.

546
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:11,960
Speaker 0: So we're just talking a whole bunch about Portal and I found this pretty funny video of two people playing Portal in the classic shtick of one of them sarcastic, but kind of smart, but kind of a dick.

547
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,940
Speaker 1: And one of them is pretending to be dumb or is kind of dumb.

548
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,639
Speaker 0: He's pretending to be really dumb, but it's animated pretty well.

549
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:22,740
Speaker 0: With the pony sisters, and it's actually really goddamn funny.

550
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,432
Speaker 1: It's kind of funny.

551
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:23,820
Speaker 1: It's clever.

552
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:25,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

553
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,020
Speaker 0: Like I started watching it.

554
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,600
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, this will probably be OK, funny.

555
00:33:29,265 --> 00:33:30,680
Speaker 0: And I laughed out loud a couple of times.

556
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Speaker 1: It's that kind of, you know, funny like Jake and Amir, which is not funny to me.

557
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:35,680
Speaker 0: I find Jake and Amir to be utterly hilarious.

558
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,200
Speaker 1: I don't like it when someone is intentionally stupid, you know, kind of funny.

559
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,624
Speaker 0: Well, you have the situation of you cannot watch fiction where there's a character who is not intelligent.

560
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:48,020
Speaker 1: They just can't be really pointlessly fake stupid.

561
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:49,605
Speaker 0: What do you mean fake stupid?

562
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:52,380
Speaker 0: Some people, Scott, are that stupid.

563
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,020
Speaker 1: But not, stupid people are not stupid in that way.

564
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,939
Speaker 0: Sometimes they are.

565
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,039
Speaker 0: No, I don't think you've met enough stupid people.

566
00:33:58,441 --> 00:33:59,960
Speaker 1: Only like Ralph Wiggum, right?

567
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,495
Speaker 1: Ralph Wiggum works, right?

568
00:34:02,941 --> 00:34:04,160
Speaker 1: Anyway, so check this out.

569
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,719
Speaker 1: I'm checking.

570
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:12,520
Speaker 1: Atlas, you know, is a company, if you don't know that, you know, they make a lot of, you know, really, really nerdy Japanese kind of games.

571
00:34:13,081 --> 00:34:14,429
Speaker 1: And occasionally those games come out in the

572
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:14,891
Speaker 1: U.S.,

573
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:18,399
Speaker 1: usually for portable systems, at least lately, DS, PSP and such.

574
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:19,744
Speaker 1: Right.

575
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:24,120
Speaker 1: And I've usually found that Atlas games, like on paper, are so awesome.

576
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:25,960
Speaker 1: And stylistically, they're so awesome.

577
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,440
Speaker 1: Japanese anime, manga styling, so awesome.

578
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,344
Speaker 1: And you want to play them.

579
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:33,056
Speaker 1: But then when you actually play them, they're so Japanese, you don't want to play them.

580
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:40,139
Speaker 0: Well, remember that time we saw that we saw an opener to what looked like an anime and we were like, this looks like the best anime.

581
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,980
Speaker 0: And then we found out it was a shitty fighting game.

582
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,221
Speaker 1: Right.

583
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:44,020
Speaker 1: So I don't think that that is Atlas.

584
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,277
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that that happened to us.

585
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, that game was called Er, Eridsvodu, right.

586
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,898
Speaker 1: It was called something else in the U.S.

587
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,800
Speaker 1: But I don't know if that was Atlas or not.

588
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,400
Speaker 1: But this game is Atlas and it's called Growlancer Wayfarer of Time.

589
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:00,997
Speaker 1: And I don't know what kind of game is.

590
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,876
Speaker 1: I guess it's an RPG.

591
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,679
Speaker 0: People have been tweeting about this.

592
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,785
Speaker 1: The opener of this game looks like an anime from like the late 80s, early 90s fantasy style.

593
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,940
Speaker 1: It's like this unbelievable opener.

594
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:18,399
Speaker 1: That is like traveling in a time machine to go back to the past.

595
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,884
Speaker 1: And it's like someone.

596
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:32,080
Speaker 1: it's like they went back in time, found an anime from the late 80s that was never actually produced, brought it to the present, used all the video from this anime as the video for this video game.

597
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,560
Speaker 1: Now, the video game is probably not worth playing, but watch this opener.

598
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:43,160
Speaker 0: Well, it says the genre is SRPG, I guess, strategy role playing game.

599
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,845
Speaker 0: I don't know what.

600
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:44,389
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

601
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,959
Speaker 1: They could be strategy.

602
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,154
Speaker 1: Usually if it was shitty RPG, shitty, I would imagine it was tactics.

603
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,739
Speaker 1: It would be T-RPG.

604
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:54,742
Speaker 0: Right.

605
00:35:54,782 --> 00:36:02,639
Speaker 0: Well, I highly doubt that tactical versus strategic plays a factor in anyone who likes RPG except us.

606
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:08,701
Speaker 1: And even then, those words don't mean whatever I guess is not a game you actually want to play.

607
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:10,490
Speaker 0: unless you like how you're.

608
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:20,465
Speaker 1: you're that kind of person who likes to play the incredibly Japanese games like, you know, Super Robot Tyson or what's the one with the maze, the maze one?

609
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:21,838
Speaker 0: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

610
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,966
Speaker 0: Etrian Odyssey.

611
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,340
Speaker 1: If you like that kind of game, then you'll probably like this game.

612
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:33,140
Speaker 0: So I recall for you, Scott, I remember a time we saw a trailer to a movie that was a remake of Kishan or Kisharn, The Robot Hunter.

613
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,642
Speaker 0: That's right.

614
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:38,580
Speaker 0: And that trailer looked like the greatest movie of our generation.

615
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,142
Speaker 1: That's right.

616
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:43,302
Speaker 0: That movie was one of the worst movies of our generation.

617
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:46,776
Speaker 0: It was indeed eclipsed only by that movie.

618
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:52,958
Speaker 0: that wasn't actually made because M. Night Shyamalan died, Avatar, The Last Airbender, which is literally the second worst movie I've ever seen.

619
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:55,305
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

620
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,060
Speaker 0: Just watch this opener and we'll tell you if the game is worthwhile later.

621
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:05,529
Speaker 0: So very briefly, in about a moment, we will be at Kinetic Con doing our thing, running the panels department.

622
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:06,520
Speaker 1: We'll be at Zenkai Con.

623
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:08,259
Speaker 0: We were already at Zenkai Con.

624
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,238
Speaker 1: By the time the show came out.

625
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mr.

626
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,320
Speaker 1: Ruining the Illusion.

627
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,339
Speaker 1: I'm the illusion ruiner, you know this.

628
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could just.

629
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:19,124
Speaker 1: You're always trying to make illusions and I'm always trying to dispel them.

630
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,460
Speaker 0: I'll just cut that part out.

631
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't.

632
00:37:23,031 --> 00:37:24,980
Speaker 0: And we'll be at PAX Prime and all that other stuff.

633
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:25,791
Speaker 0: But that's down the road.

634
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:26,439
Speaker 0: It's summer.

635
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,508
Speaker 0: I'll be in Turkey next week.

636
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,440
Speaker 1: Why are you listening to us and not going outside?

637
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:33,399
Speaker 0: Why are you listening to us and not preparing for PAX?

638
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:36,260
Speaker 0: You should have already bought your badges.

639
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,063
Speaker 1: You should have.

640
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:40,769
Speaker 1: If you haven't bought your badge already, just, you know, you don't deserve to go.

641
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:41,114
Speaker 1: So don't go.

642
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,486
Speaker 0: So we were.

643
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,137
Speaker 0: we're at a board game night at NYC.

644
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,238
Speaker 0: Scott got there a little bit before me.

645
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:50,560
Speaker 0: And when I arrived, he was playing a game.

646
00:37:51,281 --> 00:38:01,380
Speaker 0: And I just want to say that if you don't know what this game is and you see some people playing it, it looks ridiculous in terms of complexity.

647
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:01,741
Speaker 1: Right.

648
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:05,280
Speaker 1: So you have all these different colored pyramids of different shapes and sizes.

649
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,200
Speaker 1: And I had seen these pyramids at game stores.

650
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,941
Speaker 0: They're a millennium and they were always like stupidly expensive, pretty much packs of them.

651
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:15,562
Speaker 1: Pretty much every game store in the world I've ever been to sells these little pyramids.

652
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:20,624
Speaker 1: And in the little package of pyramids is like a little piece of paper and has some game in it.

653
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:24,726
Speaker 1: And I'm like, whatever, you know, it's usually next to some like random dice game.

654
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:29,160
Speaker 0: Usually it has like a whole ton of games in them because they're the ice house pieces or the labs pyramid.

655
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,260
Speaker 1: That's that's what they're known as is ice house pieces.

656
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:34,100
Speaker 1: And there's all kinds of games you can play with them.

657
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:40,379
Speaker 1: And if you go online, you can download like these packages that are like these books that is like a hundred ice house games.

658
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,081
Speaker 1: Right.

659
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:43,160
Speaker 1: All these games you can play with ice house pieces.

660
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,140
Speaker 0: They're just pawns to use to make games.

661
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:54,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know, and the thing is, because they're pyramids, because they come in multiple colors in multiple sizes, there's a lot you can do with them.

662
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:55,011
Speaker 1: You know, they stack.

663
00:38:55,842 --> 00:38:58,240
Speaker 1: So the stacking factor adds even more that you can do.

664
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,178
Speaker 0: Scott, we should use them in Burning Wheel as our arta.

665
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:01,463
Speaker 1: You can do that.

666
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:06,600
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this game that we played, you know, was called Zendo.

667
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:07,343
Speaker 1: Right.

668
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:12,240
Speaker 1: And apparently, I don't know, I obviously only know one game that you can play with ice house pieces.

669
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,280
Speaker 0: I read all the other rules for a whole bunch of other games.

670
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,739
Speaker 1: I already am of the opinion, even after knowing the rules to zero other ice house games, that this is the best ice house game.

671
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,760
Speaker 0: Having read the rules to like 10 ice house games, they're pretty shit by and large.

672
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,120
Speaker 1: Right.

673
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:28,180
Speaker 1: But anyway, so to explain Zendo, I first got to explain Mastermind.

674
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:28,682
Speaker 1: Right.

675
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:30,020
Speaker 1: So Mastermind is this game.

676
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,803
Speaker 1: It's really old.

677
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:34,200
Speaker 1: It's actually, I think, an American game and it's a code breaking game.

678
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:38,360
Speaker 1: One person comes up with a code and the code is just colors in order.

679
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,140
Speaker 1: So the code could be like red, green, blue, yellow.

680
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,480
Speaker 0: Scott, it was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Marowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.

681
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,122
Speaker 0: Awesome.

682
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:52,160
Speaker 0: But it's based on an earlier game called Bulls and Cows.

683
00:39:52,362 --> 00:39:54,319
Speaker 0: That's at least more than a century old.

684
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,560
Speaker 1: Thank you for reading Wikipedia.

685
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:02,659
Speaker 1: And the way the way Mastermind works is that one person puts the code in there and the other person is to figure out the code.

686
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,859
Speaker 1: So it's sort of a versus game.

687
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,386
Speaker 1: It's like, can you come up with a pattern that I can't figure out in some number of tries?

688
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,119
Speaker 1: It's one on one.

689
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:10,960
Speaker 1: And what you do is you make a guess.

690
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,660
Speaker 1: So you have a whole bunch of pieces and you put out a guess.

691
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:16,940
Speaker 1: And if your thing matches the other guy's thing, he's like, yeah, it matches.

692
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:18,679
Speaker 1: If it doesn't match, he's like, no, it doesn't match.

693
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,299
Speaker 1: And you got to keep trying.

694
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:28,020
Speaker 1: And based on the clues you get from his answers, right, you keep going like you'll know all that has to correct in that one.

695
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,819
Speaker 1: And that one has one correct, which means that that one is definitely green in the second slot.

696
00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:35,500
Speaker 0: So I used to play this game a lot as a kid.

697
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:40,160
Speaker 0: And now that I know game theory and I look back at it, it seems pretty solvable.

698
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,906
Speaker 0: And you know what?

699
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:47,500
Speaker 0: Just looking at Wikipedia, there are algorithms that you can just always solve it in six guesses.

700
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,800
Speaker 1: Right, because it's trivially easy to solve it in some number of guesses, because there's only, I think, four colors.

701
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:52,722
Speaker 0: Right.

702
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:57,040
Speaker 0: But there's there's one, two, three, four slots and a number of colors.

703
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:57,682
Speaker 1: Right.

704
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:00,519
Speaker 1: But yeah, mathematically, it's like you can always get it.

705
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:01,960
Speaker 0: Four pegs, six colors.

706
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:06,240
Speaker 0: There is a six guess algorithm and a five guess algorithm.

707
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:07,599
Speaker 1: Wow, that's good.

708
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:12,400
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I played this game as a kid and we actually had mastermind for kids.

709
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,420
Speaker 1: And I got to say mastermind for kids.

710
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:23,180
Speaker 1: If you're going to buy a copy of Mastermind, don't get the regular old boring mastermind, get mastermind for kids, because it is the same exact game.

711
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,119
Speaker 1: It is not modified in any way.

712
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:25,944
Speaker 1: It is.

713
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:29,442
Speaker 1: It's not like when they make Monopoly Junior and it's dumb as Monopoly.

714
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:30,105
Speaker 1: Right.

715
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:35,860
Speaker 1: Or Cluke Junior, which was similar to Clue and actually kind of better in some ways, but still dumb ass clue.

716
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,187
Speaker 0: What exactly is it called?

717
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,906
Speaker 0: Because I have a list here of all the variations and rereleases.

718
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:41,079
Speaker 1: Mastermind for kids.

719
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:45,360
Speaker 1: The reason to get mastermind for kids is because the same exact game.

720
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,660
Speaker 0: No, it only has three holes, not four, like real masterminds.

721
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:48,742
Speaker 0: What?

722
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:49,560
Speaker 0: No, I remember the one.

723
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:51,080
Speaker 0: Wikipedia says you're wrong.

724
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,460
Speaker 1: My memory must be wrong, but I remember having four holes.

725
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,040
Speaker 0: I'm glad I said the words.

726
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,645
Speaker 0: Wikipedia says you're wrong and your immediate response was, well, my memory must be wrong.

727
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,340
Speaker 0: Not Wikipedia.

728
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,264
Speaker 1: Really?

729
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:05,700
Speaker 1: Some guy on the Internet?

730
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:07,880
Speaker 1: I remember there being four colors.

731
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:08,771
Speaker 0: I'm going to look it up.

732
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:09,420
Speaker 1: Four holes.

733
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:16,073
Speaker 1: Anyway, the reason that I thought it was better if it is indeed the same game is because it has a style to it.

734
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:17,721
Speaker 1: Right.

735
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:19,740
Speaker 0: It's not elephants and hippos and lions.

736
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,385
Speaker 1: That's right.

737
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:21,759
Speaker 0: It's not shaped like a dick.

738
00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:23,380
Speaker 1: It's not with a gland.

739
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,907
Speaker 1: That's right.

740
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:24,620
Speaker 1: It is a penis.

741
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,780
Speaker 1: It's not just boring colors.

742
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:29,119
Speaker 1: It's like animal monkey hippo.

743
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,102
Speaker 1: Right.

744
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,099
Speaker 1: And it has a style to it.

745
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,480
Speaker 0: Scott, this game's a dick.

746
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,771
Speaker 1: This is why you like it.

747
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:35,278
Speaker 1: Look at this.

748
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:36,437
Speaker 1: Look at this game.

749
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:41,919
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's the version we had.

750
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,660
Speaker 1: So I remember it having four holes.

751
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,500
Speaker 0: Scott, I got to read this to you because the five guess algorithm is really simple.

752
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:54,860
Speaker 0: One, create a set S of the remaining possibilities.

753
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,640
Speaker 0: Now, there are only twelve hundred ninety six anyway.

754
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,484
Speaker 1: So pick anything.

755
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,115
Speaker 0: The first guess is AABB.

756
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:21,880
Speaker 0: Remove all possibilities from S. that would not give the same score of colored and white pegs if they were the answer for each possible guess that remains, not necessarily in S. OK, so for each possible guess, calculate how many possibilities from S would be eliminated for each possible colored white score.

757
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,640
Speaker 1: So this is not trivial to do in your brain.

758
00:43:25,261 --> 00:43:25,584
Speaker 0: All right.

759
00:43:25,786 --> 00:43:27,020
Speaker 0: So there is another algorithm.

760
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,960
Speaker 0: I'm not going to read the whole thing that you can do in your brain.

761
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:30,976
Speaker 1: That's the six guess.

762
00:43:31,017 --> 00:43:31,180
Speaker 1: Yes.

763
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,466
Speaker 0: Six guesses in the brain.

764
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:34,960
Speaker 0: Five guesses if you're a rain man or a computer.

765
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:38,240
Speaker 0: One guess if your mom's wearing glasses and you can see the room.

766
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:39,567
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

767
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:41,320
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

768
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,600
Speaker 0: Anyway, I thought I was so clever.

769
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,820
Speaker 0: I thought my parents would be like, he's a genius.

770
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,140
Speaker 0: No, they were like, you must have cheated.

771
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,797
Speaker 1: The point of Mastermind is the other guy picks something and it's like you.

772
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:53,540
Speaker 1: it's like twenty questions, right?

773
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,564
Speaker 1: It's like you slowly get more information as you guess, leading up towards guessing the correct answer.

774
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:05,400
Speaker 1: the other guy's thought up or failing to do so in the given number of guesses and then losing.

775
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,160
Speaker 1: So Zendo is the same thing, but slightly different and way better.

776
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,518
Speaker 1: The way it works is this.

777
00:44:12,462 --> 00:44:17,274
Speaker 1: One person is the game runner and they come up with something or they look in the book and pick something.

778
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:17,458
Speaker 1: Right.

779
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,080
Speaker 1: And there's different levels of difficulty.

780
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,060
Speaker 1: That is the Buddha nature.

781
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,680
Speaker 0: Now, there's this whole you know, the guy who taught it to us and played it with us.

782
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:31,960
Speaker 0: There's this whole sort of metagame of people who run it a lot aren't supposed to say like what constitutes the levels or anything.

783
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,079
Speaker 0: And you kind of figure that out.

784
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:37,419
Speaker 0: Like so the cone master will say something like this is a level three.

785
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:38,161
Speaker 1: Yeah.

786
00:44:38,181 --> 00:44:40,780
Speaker 1: They don't have to tell you what level difficulty it is or not.

787
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:41,162
Speaker 1: Right.

788
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:44,900
Speaker 1: But anyway, so every cone has different properties.

789
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:45,386
Speaker 1: Right.

790
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:46,419
Speaker 1: It has its size.

791
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:48,084
Speaker 1: It has its color.

792
00:44:48,847 --> 00:44:52,240
Speaker 1: It has number of pips on the side of which corresponds to the size.

793
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,622
Speaker 0: It does.

794
00:44:52,663 --> 00:44:55,340
Speaker 1: So a big one has three pips and a small one has one pippin.

795
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,378
Speaker 1: A medium one is two pips.

796
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:05,280
Speaker 1: It can also be laying on its side, which means and because the pyramid, even though it's laying on its side, it could be pointing in different directions.

797
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:08,600
Speaker 0: It could be not on the table if it is stacked on another pyramid.

798
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could be pointing at a pyramid.

799
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,820
Speaker 1: It could be covered by a pyramid if one is stacked on top of it.

800
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:16,320
Speaker 1: It could be covered by two pyramids.

801
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,640
Speaker 0: It could be pointed at another pyramid that itself is not touching the table.

802
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,060
Speaker 1: Right.

803
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:26,850
Speaker 1: So what happens is at the very beginning of the game, the game runner, the master.

804
00:45:27,095 --> 00:45:27,300
Speaker 1: Right.

805
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,391
Speaker 1: And everyone else is a student and the game runner is.

806
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:33,402
Speaker 1: the master decides on what is the Buddha nature.

807
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:37,822
Speaker 1: So the Buddha nature could be something like at least one pyramid is green.

808
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:42,080
Speaker 1: So they would produce a set of pyramids in some configuration.

809
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:52,620
Speaker 1: That is the Buddha nature, meaning there is at least one green pyramid in it, and they would put next to it a gem signifying that that set has the Buddha nature, typically a white stone.

810
00:45:53,562 --> 00:45:53,843
Speaker 1: Yes.

811
00:45:53,863 --> 00:46:00,520
Speaker 1: Then they will produce another set using any number of pyramids in any configuration that does not have the Buddha nature.

812
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,160
Speaker 1: So in this example case, there would be no green pyramids in that set whatsoever.

813
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:16,324
Speaker 1: Then player one, and this is where it gets better than mastermind because you can have a lot of players guessing right in a round player one produces a set of pyramids and lays them out.

814
00:46:16,889 --> 00:46:18,020
Speaker 1: And then he has two choices.

815
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,931
Speaker 1: He can either say student or master.

816
00:46:20,535 --> 00:46:21,420
Speaker 1: if he says students.

817
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:23,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll do master first.

818
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:32,760
Speaker 1: If he says master, the master will then place a stone next to that set, signifying whether that set does or does not have the Buddha nature.

819
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:40,680
Speaker 0: Now, it's very the best way to play this is to kind of get into the theme a little bit and be very formal, like master, wise master.

820
00:46:41,182 --> 00:46:51,927
Speaker 0: Does this set, you know, even just exhibit the Buddha nature, reading around the Internet, people usually just say the word master and then the master will silently place the white or the black stone.

821
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:53,520
Speaker 0: And that is the only interaction.

822
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:54,243
Speaker 1: That's good.

823
00:46:54,985 --> 00:47:02,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, then after doing so right, because you would never you could do before doing so, but there's no reason to because you can always get the free guess.

824
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:05,760
Speaker 1: You can use your guessing stone.

825
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,168
Speaker 1: How many guessing stones everyone get?

826
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:09,199
Speaker 0: Everyone starts with, I believe, one or two.

827
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:09,684
Speaker 1: One or two.

828
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:10,740
Speaker 1: You have a guessing stone.

829
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,540
Speaker 0: There's different sets of rules online.

830
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:16,700
Speaker 1: If you use the guessing stone, you would guess at the Buddha nature.

831
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:27,720
Speaker 1: So if you put your guessing stone, you could say the Buddha nature is at least two greens or if and only if the number of blue pieces touching at least one green piece is odd.

832
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,762
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be.

833
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:33,400
Speaker 1: or the number of pips on all the pyramids combined is a prime number.

834
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:34,142
Speaker 1: Right.

835
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:41,378
Speaker 1: You know, or the you know, the square of all the pips combined is, you know, larger than 100, something like that.

836
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:52,213
Speaker 1: And then, you know, what would happen is, A, either you would win because you guessed correctly or B, the master would then produce a set of pyramids.

837
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:56,059
Speaker 1: that is contradictory to the thing you just said.

838
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:07,246
Speaker 0: So either is an example that breaks your rule, but still gets a white stone because it has the Buddha nature or something that does not have the Buddha nature, but that perfectly meets your rule.

839
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:09,500
Speaker 0: Now, this is why this game is so fascinating.

840
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:15,603
Speaker 0: You can't cheat as the master because that will become immediately apparent to the students.

841
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:18,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, because everything has to be consistent.

842
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:32,300
Speaker 0: And if you come up with a rule for the Buddha nature and a student comes up with an equivalent rule, the master that that counts because the master is unable to refute the rule, even though it's worded differently.

843
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,751
Speaker 0: So it gets you out of that sort of fiddly wording problem because at its core, it's inductive reasoning.

844
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:38,340
Speaker 1: Right.

845
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:43,436
Speaker 1: So, you know, for example, let's say the Buddha nature was, you know, I don't know.

846
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:55,420
Speaker 1: There are no red pieces, there are no red pieces, right, and the other guy says there are only pieces that are blue, green, black or yellow.

847
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:56,264
Speaker 1: Right.

848
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:58,459
Speaker 1: Well, obviously those are equivalent rules.

849
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:00,000
Speaker 0: Here's a more sidelong example.

850
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,721
Speaker 0: My my guess for the there are no red pieces is there are no pyramids pointing at a red piece.

851
00:49:08,868 --> 00:49:12,380
Speaker 0: That is an equivalent rule, because how is the master going to refute that?

852
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,840
Speaker 1: There are no pyramids pointing at a red piece, you know, I guess.

853
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:18,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

854
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:26,520
Speaker 1: So it's, you know, you come up with pretty much the same rule, you know, or an equivalent rule that a contradictory example could not be produced anyway.

855
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:33,199
Speaker 1: So you go around the table and you make, you know, you play and if you want to use your guessing stone, you can guess.

856
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,620
Speaker 1: But if you fail at guessing, you lost your guessing stone and now you can't guess again.

857
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,120
Speaker 1: So if you figure out the answer and you don't have a guessing stone, you're fucked.

858
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,520
Speaker 0: So, Scott, how does one get more guessing stone?

859
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,480
Speaker 1: Well, instead of choosing master, you choose students.

860
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:55,900
Speaker 1: So you produce your set for free at the beginning of your turn and you say students and then everyone puts out a hand, everyone puts out a sealed hand.

861
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:59,120
Speaker 1: And in that sealed hand is a black or a white stone guess.

862
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:06,120
Speaker 1: And it's a guess that every student guesses whether the, you know, set you just produced exhibits the Buddha nature or not.

863
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:09,540
Speaker 1: If they guess correctly, they receive a guessing stone.

864
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,560
Speaker 1: If they guess wrongly, they don't receive a guessing stone.

865
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,020
Speaker 0: But this can be a little dangerous because you're giving everyone else the opportunity.

866
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:18,279
Speaker 0: For example, say someone else is closer than you.

867
00:50:18,803 --> 00:50:21,200
Speaker 0: You might give them a guessing stone because they guess better.

868
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:27,420
Speaker 1: And in fact, if you are closer, the odds of guessing correctly and getting the guessing stone when someone chooses students are much higher.

869
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,880
Speaker 0: Now, the other thing is this is where it gets interesting.

870
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:39,721
Speaker 0: You might notice that someone else, the shapes they made or the cones they made on their turn seem to be testing certain things and they guess right on a couple of students in a row.

871
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:46,240
Speaker 0: You could figure out that they're clearly on the right track and look at what they were constructing and asking the master.

872
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:50,260
Speaker 0: So you're interacting with the other players and their tests.

873
00:50:50,642 --> 00:50:55,083
Speaker 0: For example, you might be close, but you might not want to do a certain test because it tips your hand.

874
00:50:55,123 --> 00:51:01,220
Speaker 0: If you think that you're on the right path and no one else is, you don't want to do a test that makes it obvious you're testing color, for example.

875
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,520
Speaker 0: So the game gets really interesting in that level.

876
00:51:04,843 --> 00:51:06,540
Speaker 0: But in the end, it's just pattern recognition.

877
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much.

878
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:14,860
Speaker 1: it's the same game as Mastermind, only multiplayer and much more complex because there are so many more factors that go into it.

879
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,080
Speaker 0: Now, usually people play with a set of ground rules.

880
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,348
Speaker 0: Like if you make a guess, like there are only blue pieces next to yellow pieces, if whatever, whatever, whatever.

881
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:24,600
Speaker 0: There's a thousand qualifiers.

882
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,780
Speaker 0: The master can be like, that's ridiculous.

883
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,019
Speaker 0: I'm not even going to take a stone.

884
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:28,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

885
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:33,640
Speaker 1: And the thing is, the master isn't going to choose something for the Buddha nature that is so complicated.

886
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,802
Speaker 0: He could, but only if all the players are on that level or are really willing to deal with that.

887
00:51:38,822 --> 00:51:38,963
Speaker 0: Yeah.

888
00:51:39,003 --> 00:51:52,879
Speaker 1: Who's going to be a jerk and be like, yeah, the Buddha nature is at least one blue pointing at a yellow, at least one yellow pointing at a green, at least one thing somewhere that's stacked, at least two pyramids laying down and all the pips add up to an odd number.

889
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,103
Speaker 1: And there's no green.

890
00:51:54,143 --> 00:52:03,519
Speaker 0: Now, more importantly, it's like there are no situational conditions like the player, who the player is or what time it is or anything.

891
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,019
Speaker 0: It's just the pieces.

892
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be absolute bullshit.

893
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,281
Speaker 1: Right.

894
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:07,965
Speaker 0: And in fact, how would you?

895
00:52:07,985 --> 00:52:11,940
Speaker 1: because you have to be able to look at all the sets that are out on the table as examples.

896
00:52:12,081 --> 00:52:12,221
Speaker 1: Right.

897
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:18,600
Speaker 1: As you play, you know, just like in Mastermind, every set you play stays out on the table unless you start to run out of expensive.

898
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,339
Speaker 0: Now, more importantly, the way people play this game, too, is you can use anything.

899
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,883
Speaker 0: you could use just any random assortment of bits, as long as they're reasonably consistent with one another.

900
00:52:27,627 --> 00:52:33,934
Speaker 0: And you define the ground rules ahead of time when you're playing with a given group as to what is and is not a state.

901
00:52:34,015 --> 00:52:35,360
Speaker 0: as far as far as the game.

902
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:45,580
Speaker 0: For example, when we were playing, you could put a pyramid pointing at another pyramid, but it did not matter where it was pointing, only that it was pointing at the pyramid or at no pyramid.

903
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:45,902
Speaker 0: Yeah.

904
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:48,300
Speaker 1: Or what it didn't matter what direction it was pointing either.

905
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:49,644
Speaker 0: Yes.

906
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:53,080
Speaker 0: And you could not put a pyramid inside of a pyramid.

907
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,602
Speaker 0: There was pointing at not pointing at on the table, not on the table, laying down, standing up.

908
00:52:58,823 --> 00:52:59,686
Speaker 0: But there was no.

909
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:06,420
Speaker 0: like in a small pyramid inside of a big pyramid was the same as a small pyramid pointing at a big pyramid.

910
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:14,794
Speaker 1: Before the game, we decided what was going to be a factor, like let's say you could have a game where you said, listen, the only things that are going to be a factor in this game are color and size.

911
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:15,680
Speaker 1: Nothing else matters.

912
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:16,803
Speaker 1: Right.

913
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:18,520
Speaker 1: So it's like, oh, so arrangement doesn't matter.

914
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:18,821
Speaker 1: No.

915
00:53:18,841 --> 00:53:22,167
Speaker 1: So green, green, blue is the same as green, blue, green, if they're all the same size.

916
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:22,980
Speaker 1: Right.

917
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:31,580
Speaker 1: But, you know, medium green, medium blue, big green is different than medium blue, medium green, medium yellow.

918
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:32,505
Speaker 0: Right.

919
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,520
Speaker 1: So color and size matter, but nothing else.

920
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:34,741
Speaker 1: Yep.

921
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:40,040
Speaker 0: So because the order didn't matter, order only mattered if things were pointing and then it was just what's pointing at what.

922
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:40,361
Speaker 0: Right.

923
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:48,180
Speaker 1: So you determine before you start which factors come into play so you can, you know, limit the set of things you have to test for when deciphering the code.

924
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:55,339
Speaker 1: And yeah, this is crazy fun because, you know, everyone's sitting there racking their brain going, what could it be?

925
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:55,882
Speaker 1: What could it be?

926
00:53:55,923 --> 00:53:59,899
Speaker 1: And you try something you think is clever and then you think it's the Buddha nature and it's not.

927
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,620
Speaker 1: Or you think it is or you think it's not.

928
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,160
Speaker 0: And it is a really, really good master, too.

929
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,459
Speaker 0: He's obviously played this game a lot.

930
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,940
Speaker 0: He invested in these fucking expensive pieces of plastic.

931
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,380
Speaker 0: I tried to buy them online.

932
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,380
Speaker 0: So the cheapest way to get them in bulk that we can find.

933
00:54:15,723 --> 00:54:16,799
Speaker 0: I did a lot of research.

934
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,579
Speaker 1: You couldn't find used ones on eBay or.

935
00:54:19,182 --> 00:54:20,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't find anything like that.

936
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,960
Speaker 0: Also, I realized my whole life, you know, I've been on stuff on eBay.

937
00:54:23,502 --> 00:54:25,339
Speaker 0: I've never actually bought a thing on eBay.

938
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:29,980
Speaker 1: I've actually bought quite a ever a nice bunch of stuff on eBay in my entire life.

939
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:31,344
Speaker 0: But I will link to.

940
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:40,520
Speaker 0: there's a game called Ice Dice, and it comes with a total of 30 of these pyramids and cost about fifteen to seventy dollars.

941
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,060
Speaker 1: Thirty sets of pyramids.

942
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:43,640
Speaker 1: That's 30 pyramids.

943
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,880
Speaker 0: The sets of pyramids themselves cost twice as much per pyramid.

944
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:50,522
Speaker 0: Yeah.

945
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:57,439
Speaker 0: So you were best off buying this crappy ice dice game and you get a big bag and all these pieces and some weird dice.

946
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:04,120
Speaker 1: So when I say a set of pyramids, I mean, right, one red, one small red, one medium red, one one big, right?

947
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:04,990
Speaker 1: All the same color.

948
00:55:05,031 --> 00:55:05,699
Speaker 1: That's a set.

949
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:06,467
Speaker 1: Right.

950
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:07,599
Speaker 1: So how many colors are there?

951
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:10,020
Speaker 0: There's like, well, there are different.

952
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,760
Speaker 0: We play with five colors, I believe.

953
00:55:11,981 --> 00:55:15,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are other sets of colors.

954
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:17,791
Speaker 0: And I didn't get those.

955
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:18,900
Speaker 0: like there's a Zeno set.

956
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:24,259
Speaker 0: And notice how some of the advanced cones have the idea of a, quote, strange piece.

957
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:29,800
Speaker 0: This game can have as many dimensions of buddiness as between five colors.

958
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:30,483
Speaker 1: Right.

959
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:33,779
Speaker 1: You know, red, green, blue, yellow, black, I think are the colors.

960
00:55:34,142 --> 00:55:35,230
Speaker 1: Yeah.

961
00:55:35,452 --> 00:55:36,420
Speaker 1: Three pyramids each.

962
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,460
Speaker 1: So that's five times three is fifteen.

963
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,140
Speaker 1: That's fifteen pyramids.

964
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:47,920
Speaker 1: If you buy a copy of ice dice, you get, you know, two blacks of each size, two reds of each size, two yellows of each size.

965
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:49,340
Speaker 1: It's not a lot of pyramids.

966
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:53,640
Speaker 1: You know, you need to spend it's crazy money to get a lot of these pyramids.

967
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:57,820
Speaker 1: But if you think about it, you know, it's like, OK, you don't really need the pyramids.

968
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,830
Speaker 1: You could make these.

969
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,860
Speaker 1: You could do whatever.

970
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,420
Speaker 0: But you want the pyramids, you want the pyramids.

971
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,540
Speaker 1: And two, even though they're seemingly crazy, overpriced and stupid.

972
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:10,755
Speaker 1: And Zendo seems to be the only good game we've discovered to play with them.

973
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:17,282
Speaker 1: yet, there are a bajillion games you can play with these and they're just really useful gaming pieces in general.

974
00:56:17,823 --> 00:56:24,880
Speaker 1: So it's sort of worth it if you heavily utilize them in gaming frequently and try to play all these games with them or come up with games.

975
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,009
Speaker 1: It is very telling that they're so.

976
00:56:27,029 --> 00:56:35,520
Speaker 1: they're such versatile game pieces and they don't serve the same, you know, uses as dice or generic pawns or other gaming pieces.

977
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:43,240
Speaker 1: You know, so they're so they're unique that it's sort of worth having at least some of them if you're not going to buy a ton of them.

978
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:55,239
Speaker 0: The telling factor as to why I think this game was good is that we're playing it for a while and one people kept coming up and staring at it because it looks to them, especially if you're playing like master and then a stone comes out, students, stones come out.

979
00:56:56,321 --> 00:57:00,876
Speaker 0: This game is incomprehensible to outsiders and it looks fascinating and complicated to.

980
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:05,200
Speaker 0: we just kept playing it and at one point we're like, hey, should we play something else?

981
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,133
Speaker 0: Everyone kind of sat there.

982
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:08,599
Speaker 0: No, let's just keep playing this.

983
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:10,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played it for a while.

984
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:19,563
Speaker 1: But the other thing that you can do right is it's up to the master sort of even though the master has no stake in the winning or losing, it's up to them and determining the difficulty.

985
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:19,824
Speaker 1: Right.

986
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:22,600
Speaker 1: The master could purposefully try to throw you off.

987
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:24,940
Speaker 1: Like let's say our master did this really well.

988
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:30,320
Speaker 0: He gave what is possibly the most unhelpful set of initial examples possible.

989
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:30,821
Speaker 1: Right.

990
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:37,395
Speaker 1: So let's say we determine that stacking color size, laying down a number of pips are all going to be factors.

991
00:57:37,517 --> 00:57:37,700
Speaker 1: Right.

992
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:40,338
Speaker 1: But the actual Buddha nature is no mediums.

993
00:57:41,182 --> 00:57:41,464
Speaker 1: Right.

994
00:57:41,726 --> 00:57:43,620
Speaker 1: So I lay out something with no mediums.

995
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,660
Speaker 1: It's got guys laying down and pointing every which way and stacking and whatever.

996
00:57:48,204 --> 00:57:49,600
Speaker 1: And I say that is the Buddha nature.

997
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:51,058
Speaker 1: And then I lay another one down.

998
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:52,980
Speaker 0: It's just one medium by itself.

999
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,149
Speaker 1: It has a medium.

1000
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:55,520
Speaker 1: Well, that might be too obvious.

1001
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:57,940
Speaker 0: It's a medium and a bunch of other pieces.

1002
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:00,280
Speaker 1: It's a medium and a whole mess of stuff.

1003
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,099
Speaker 1: And I say that does have the Buddha nature.

1004
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,252
Speaker 1: And people be like, whoa, you know, it's like.

1005
00:58:05,312 --> 00:58:19,680
Speaker 1: I purposely try to throw you off by putting all this extra information in there and you're going to have to over time sort of figure out based on what does and doesn't have the Buddha nature that, oh, stacking doesn't matter in this one, even though, you know, we didn't say it beforehand.

1006
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:22,100
Speaker 1: So you had to figure it out in game, extending the game.

1007
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:29,080
Speaker 1: And if the game gets really long, you either have to remove some of the sets from the table to use the pieces or buy a lot of pieces.

1008
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:35,500
Speaker 1: So to play a really complex, difficult, incredibly high level game of the Zendo, you need a lot of expensive pieces.

1009
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,299
Speaker 0: I ordered three sets of the ice dice, which was like forty five bucks or so.

1010
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:39,923
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1011
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:41,920
Speaker 1: So you could have gotten a real board game for that money.

1012
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,075
Speaker 0: The thing is, I think I would order a few more sets of it just because this.

1013
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:47,680
Speaker 0: these pieces will be useful, last me forever.

1014
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,120
Speaker 0: And it is very fun to be the master.

1015
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,340
Speaker 0: You can see the kinds of people who like to run this.

1016
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,882
Speaker 0: This is a game.

1017
00:58:54,902 --> 00:59:00,348
Speaker 0: you go to PAX and you will gather a gigantic crowd who will want to play this game trivially.

1018
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,080
Speaker 1: And you can even come up with some variants.

1019
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:02,542
Speaker 1: Right.

1020
00:59:02,684 --> 00:59:03,940
Speaker 1: Because these play any game.

1021
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:04,161
Speaker 1: Right.

1022
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:08,246
Speaker 1: You come up with variants for like, you know, people could come up to the table, make a guess and leave.

1023
00:59:08,366 --> 00:59:10,640
Speaker 1: And like you just people keep coming up, getting a line.

1024
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,940
Speaker 1: And when you get to the front of the line, it's your turn.

1025
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,226
Speaker 1: And it's just a crazy long line.

1026
00:59:14,247 --> 00:59:18,440
Speaker 1: And then whoever gets it wins and your table just keeps filling up with more and more pieces.

1027
00:59:18,842 --> 00:59:21,200
Speaker 1: But since everyone's in line, they don't see it till they get up there.

1028
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:24,140
Speaker 1: And like maybe they have 30 seconds to do something, you know.

1029
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,399
Speaker 1: Anyway, you could come up with a lot of fun stuff to do.

1030
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:28,588
Speaker 0: It's a super fun game.

1031
00:59:28,628 --> 00:59:30,300
Speaker 0: I highly recommend it, but it's expensive.

1032
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:33,480
Speaker 0: So trick one of your friends into buying the pieces and running it for you.

1033
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:38,645
Speaker 1: Or maybe find some other sort of pieces that have an equal number of factors that you can play.

1034
00:59:38,686 --> 00:59:40,279
Speaker 0: You can do this with like dice.

1035
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:41,545
Speaker 1: Sort of.

1036
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:43,079
Speaker 1: You need colored dice.

1037
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,628
Speaker 0: If you had a giant bag of D&D dice and you agreed that color didn't matter, you could play this game.

1038
00:59:48,649 --> 00:59:49,297
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1039
00:59:50,662 --> 00:59:51,732
Speaker 1: Or maybe color does matter.

1040
00:59:51,752 --> 00:59:52,499
Speaker 1: You have a whole bunch of D&D.

1041
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:56,060
Speaker 0: I say color doesn't matter because usually you have a bunch of different colored dice.

1042
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:56,461
Speaker 1: Right.

1043
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:57,667
Speaker 1: But you could go out and buy.

1044
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:02,080
Speaker 1: like the thing is, dice end up being more expensive than Icehouse pieces.

1045
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,340
Speaker 0: Yes.

1046
01:00:02,421 --> 01:00:05,957
Speaker 0: And it's not like the old days where I really needed 40 different D20s.

1047
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,223
Speaker 1: I know, right?

1048
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:09,400
Speaker 1: Because the first one wasn't lucky enough.

1049
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,572
Speaker 0: Now I just need a sack of D6s.

1050
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,530
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1051
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:24,814
