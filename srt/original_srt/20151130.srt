1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,369
Speaker 1: It's Monday, November 30th, 2015.

2
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,292
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:19,448
Speaker 1: I'm scared and this is geek nights tonight Talking about headphone jacks.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,332
Speaker 0: This is rooms.

5
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:22,319
Speaker 1: I did TRS and all that biz.

6
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,677
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:37,372
Speaker 1: So today, I'm you know my building is for elevators for work like the office just for like our elevator bank because it's a tall building and There's a lot of semi public businesses on it.

8
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,880
Speaker 1: So people use it off and on throughout the day.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:49,738
Speaker 1: But today like 11 I went down and did some stuff and I go to take the elevator back up and there's a woman Standing there like waiting for the elevator, but she has not hit the button to go up.

10
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:58,580
Speaker 1: So fine, so I go and hit the button and then she turns me and says Excuse me, sir, and already I'm like, oh, why is she tell who's this person?

11
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,403
Speaker 1: Why are they talking to me?

12
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:02,112
Speaker 1: and she's like are you riding the elevator up?

13
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:07,935
Speaker 1: and I'm like, yes I'm riding this elevator up and she's like what floor are you going to?

14
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:12,860
Speaker 0: and I'm Part of me is thinking maybe why do I have to tell you where I'm going?

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,210
Speaker 1: maybe I should not respond because this is like crazy person.

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:24,049
Speaker 1: bells are going off, but well-dressed not a hobo like Yeah, yeah, but seriously there is it's New York.

17
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:33,060
Speaker 1: the reality is if someone reeks of urine and starts asking you stuff It's very yeah, but just cuz you don't speak of your it doesn't mean it doesn't mean oh, you don't pull the shields down.

18
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:34,499
Speaker 0: I'm not telling you where I'm going.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,960
Speaker 1: You do not put the shields down just because someone doesn't reek of urine, but you might actually respond to the hail.

20
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,776
Speaker 1: So I'm like, I'm going up to the 16th floor and she's like, oh, okay.

21
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:46,800
Speaker 1: I'm going to 15.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,605
Speaker 1: Can I ride with you?

23
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:50,562
Speaker 1: and I'm like, uh Guess.

24
00:01:51,364 --> 00:02:10,699
Speaker 1: so the elevator comes and I get in and I wait for her to hit 15 and I hit 16 And then she starts explaining to me that she won't ride elevators alone because she's afraid to Okay, so instead I guess she waits for the first stranger who comes by and decides to get in the elevator with him.

25
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,140
Speaker 0: You don't have to ask you can just wait for them to go in the elevator.

26
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,591
Speaker 1: I think she was worried that what if she got in with me and I did?

27
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:24,598
Speaker 1: she kind of explained this and I went to A lower floor than her cuz then I would abandon her so she'd have to get off in the same floor I got off on but that would be weird.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,596
Speaker 0: You could get over it and deal with.

29
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:35,700
Speaker 1: yeah I don't know what aspect because she's afraid of being alone in the elevator.

30
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,407
Speaker 1: So I joked.

31
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:42,137
Speaker 1: I was like, well, you know Elevators are pretty safe like once you're in if it's not like someone else can get in when they're between floors.

32
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,304
Speaker 1: and she's like You don't know that.

33
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,758
Speaker 1: and then I was like, yeah shields are back up.

34
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,125
Speaker 1: It's kind of like hers.

35
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:51,290
Speaker 1: it reminds me of.

36
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,160
Speaker 1: I learned that there are actually people who have it.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,139
Speaker 1: There's an app for this too, but people have a job of hanging out.

38
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:00,540
Speaker 1: You know that bridge by the water gap down in Delaware that we used to take all the time.

39
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:01,442
Speaker 0: Yeah I know that bridge.

40
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:07,877
Speaker 1: so there are people who are so afraid to ride in cars over that that they hire people to drive them Over that and they like sit in the back and cry.

41
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,644
Speaker 1: I guess Like that is the thing.

42
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:10,186
Speaker 1: There's a job.

43
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,580
Speaker 1: You can have a drive people's cars over that bridge for them every day.

44
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:22,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I wonder if I could get a job hanging around in my elevator Lobby riding the elevator with people as an escort.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:32,340
Speaker 0: Uh What they should do is you just push the person the elevator and close the door Be like, uh, I guess you're free of elevators.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,492
Speaker 0: There's a self-fulfilling Prophecy would have been funnier if you never would have said anything.

47
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:39,566
Speaker 0: you could have written the elevator normally like everyone else But because you were afraid.

48
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,355
Speaker 0: well now you're gonna have to suffer.

49
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:42,240
Speaker 1: you don't think about this too.

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,944
Speaker 1: It's just like.

51
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:44,091
Speaker 0: this is why you.

52
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:45,580
Speaker 0: it's just like with your annoying noises.

53
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,600
Speaker 0: It's like well now that we know that noise annoys you guess what's gonna happen?

54
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,010
Speaker 1: I think you learn one noise.

55
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:54,760
Speaker 1: that doesn't annoy me but This is why you were not a proper troll.

56
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:04,292
Speaker 1: This is why I am a schooled troll from the olden times and why I really feel bad about how this word has been denigrated Because a proper troll would have agreed to this woman's request.

57
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:06,540
Speaker 1: pushed five got into the elevator with her.

58
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,848
Speaker 1: No, not just gotten off hit 16.

59
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,740
Speaker 1: She hits 15. wait until the door is just about to close.

60
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:20,375
Speaker 1: Jump through it not tripping the sensor that would reopen the door So that she is suddenly trapped on her own without having been touched or shoved in any way.

61
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:25,634
Speaker 1: because if you shove her you were An asshole, but simply getting out of an elevator does not make one an asshole.

62
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,079
Speaker 1: that makes one a troll.

63
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,242
Speaker 0: Oh shit I forgot my coat.

64
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:31,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's even better if you make a polite excuse.

65
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,520
Speaker 1: So now she has no excuse.

66
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:41,516
Speaker 1: So yeah, that was my morning and I thought about this all day because that was it was the weirdest thing that's happened to me in some time.

67
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:42,475
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

68
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,900
Speaker 0: What weirder thing is I hope she was taking the elevator to like the psychologist office.

69
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,254
Speaker 1: There is one but it's on the 16th floor.

70
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:50,220
Speaker 0: Isn't that where she went?

71
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,887
Speaker 1: No, she went to the 15th floor.

72
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,234
Speaker 1: fuck if I know what's down there.

73
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,420
Speaker 1: It looks identical to my floor.

74
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,128
Speaker 0: So why doesn't she just use stairs?

75
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,660
Speaker 1: You can't take the stairs up in my building only down.

76
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,102
Speaker 0: Why not?

77
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,749
Speaker 1: because they're locked one way.

78
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,411
Speaker 1: Whoa.

79
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can use the stairs my building all you want.

80
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,969
Speaker 1: I know I wish you could use the stairs in my building.

81
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:08,820
Speaker 0: I complained and the response I gotta take the stairs to the 16th floor.

82
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:12,931
Speaker 1: I talked to the super and I asked like hey Like could we set it up so we can take the stairs up during the day?

83
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:18,840
Speaker 1: and his response was to raise his eyes And look at me not respond and then look back down at his palate.

84
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,755
Speaker 1: So that was how far I got on that one.

85
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:24,727
Speaker 0: You should be like Alright, obviously there's some reason.

86
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:25,651
Speaker 0: you think that that's stupid.

87
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,877
Speaker 0: Can you please tell me that reason?

88
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:29,058
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I don't think he wanted me to talk to him.

89
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,698
Speaker 0: fine, I'm gonna go and talk to my.

90
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:38,164
Speaker 1: Go through, you know, the the building manager, but he basically is like there's no one above him I can talk to.

91
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,511
Speaker 0: he's collecting your rents.

92
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,970
Speaker 1: I'm actively but As great Scott get a building downtown.

93
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,678
Speaker 1: It's not like your fancy midtown.

94
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,749
Speaker 0: If I talk to the guy he's just like.

95
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:50,352
Speaker 0: hey, how's it going?

96
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,980

Speaker 1: Anything to talk about in the first bit of the show this Monday?

98
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,539
Speaker 1: No, no nothing.

99
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,545
Speaker 0: We already did an episode that I don't give a shit and I'm find myself somehow even just a week later You've been giving less of a shit.

100
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,513
Speaker 0: All right, two weeks later.

101
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,160
Speaker 0: So there is no tech news.

102
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:07,484
Speaker 1: First things first.

103
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:10,012
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about building a new HTTP see.

104
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:14,528
Speaker 1: cuz my HTTP see is on its last legs I just upgraded mine to Windows 10.

105
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,355
Speaker 1: I did that a long time ago.

106
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,660
Speaker 0: Well, it just got the notification.

107
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,505
Speaker 0: I didn't do.

108
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,591
Speaker 0: I didn't push it, right?

109
00:06:19,732 --> 00:06:22,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, I made it for the notification So and I had free time.

110
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:27,039
Speaker 0: finally on this, you know the weekend so Thanksgiving afterwards anyway.

111
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:29,479
Speaker 0: So, I mean it's kind of slow.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,067
Speaker 0: It's only i3 and the.

113
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:39,357
Speaker 0: the low profile video card is weak So it can only play rocket league on like you have the GTX 460. no, it's an AMD whatever.

114
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:40,540
Speaker 0: I think it's actually 80.

115
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,163
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

116
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:45,322
Speaker 1: It's it's whoa something cuz I have a low profile, but it's a GTX 460.

117
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,671
Speaker 1: Like it is a real video car.

118
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:47,900
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a real video card.

119
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,442
Speaker 0: It's just old.

120
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:51,255
Speaker 0: so I mean it can play rocket league on low settings, you know, it's fine.

121
00:06:51,918 --> 00:07:06,440
Speaker 0: But uh, You know I don't do really too much 3d gaming on there and you can use the steam stream for all kinds of games with really fancy And it has no problem like power wise like playing HD videos or streaming HD videos or anything like that.

122
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,350
Speaker 0: The only slowness is the storage.

123
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,548
Speaker 0: it took a long time to upgrade to Windows 10 Yeah, and mine takes a long time to boot.

124
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:22,799
Speaker 0: SSDs are way cheap right now with the sales, especially I saw 250 something gigabyte SSDs for like 80 bucks or like 200 gig ones for like 50 bucks.

125
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,931
Speaker 0: It's like there's a new egg in Amazon.

126
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:25,233
Speaker 0: You can get.

127
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:26,520
Speaker 0: SSDs are way cheap right now.

128
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,881
Speaker 0: I saw 120 120 for $34.

129
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,486
Speaker 1: Yes, like I thought about buying one, but I'm like, you know what?

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,205
Speaker 0: Why spend any money?

131
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:36,820
Speaker 0: because it's still just it's still getting the job done.

132
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's exactly where I went to.

133
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:47,515
Speaker 0: because I because my problem is that it's like oh no It's a little bit slow when I have to read some files But usually it's reading files over the network and not over the and I'm not doing that.

134
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:52,738
Speaker 1: often the games I play on it all work fine is mostly emulation and like necro dancer and things like that.

135
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,800
Speaker 1: Yeah It's slow to reboot but I don't.

136
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:58,591
Speaker 0: You can still mount your friends like a die.

137
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:05,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, the booting is slow big deal Yeah, but lately it's a recent thing and I have not updated the driver.

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,853
Speaker 1: The video card will just crash and flip out.

139
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,920
Speaker 0: I think that's Nvidia driver because I'm my desktop.

140
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,646
Speaker 1: Oh, but this was a not Also happens.

141
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,033
Speaker 1: This was not happening before.

142
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:17,359
Speaker 0: there a recent driver update.

143
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,475
Speaker 0: with your Apply the driver update you switch from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

144
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:30,432
Speaker 1: Yeah But when I switched to Windows 10 this didn't happen for a long time and then it started happening Like I mean mine happens about once every month or two.

145
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:32,520
Speaker 0: There's a like Nvidia driver has crashed.

146
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,558
Speaker 0: I think it happened actually a couple weeks ago with some sieve.

147
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:40,400
Speaker 1: So, uh, I think I'm gonna dust it and reseat everything and see if that goes away.

148
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:43,599
Speaker 0: I was doing some research on dusting while looking also at the deals.

149
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,432
Speaker 0: Apparently, you know a lot of people like canned air is just poison chemicals.

150
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:50,640
Speaker 0: It's not actually compressed air and a can whatever.

151
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:53,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that open the window when you use it.

152
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:58,060
Speaker 0: guys like yeah, but they're like no environment some hippie, whatever.

153
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,426
Speaker 0: So I'm like, well, what's your alternative?

154
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:04,482
Speaker 1: you're gonna buy a air compressor like just compressed air depending on how you do It could.

155
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,034
Speaker 1: it could introduce static issues.

156
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:06,498
Speaker 0: Sure, right?

157
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,342
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

158
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:12,040
Speaker 0: is you don't use an air compressor you got it, right and they're like, this is product on Amazon.

159
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,577
Speaker 0: That's like the hurricane something or tornado or something like that.

160
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:19,019
Speaker 0: where it's like, yeah You just battery-powered it blow and it you know, whatever.

161
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:22,737
Speaker 0: Apparently if you read the reviews like it's a total it's a total bullshit.

162
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:23,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,553
Speaker 1: I go through about a can of air every two years.

164
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,560
Speaker 1: So I think that's okay.

165
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just bought.

166
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:31,981
Speaker 0: I went on Amazon to buy the cans of air and you know what one can was $10.

167
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:32,342
Speaker 1: Let me guess.

168
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:36,035
Speaker 0: two cans was like $11 to pack was like 30.

169
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:42,651
Speaker 0: Oh, so I bought two one-pack Hahaha 20 which is deeper than the two-pack.

170
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:46,267
Speaker 1: So what I'm looking into now is There's two ways I can go.

171
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:46,608
Speaker 1: Basically.

172
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,477
Speaker 1: I'm gonna run this HD PC until it dies But I'm done with ATX.

173
00:09:51,920 --> 00:10:04,552
Speaker 1: I'm either gonna get a micro ATX in the shoebox form factor instead of the VCR form factor Because the shoebox cases can have a full-size video card on a micro ATX Motherboard.

174
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:04,973
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:10,870
Speaker 0: So I'm done with but if you just rotate that video card somehow 90 degrees You can't though because it's not like the old days.

176
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,644
Speaker 1: You could put like giant risers out of your motherboard and not affect performance like risers.

177
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,510
Speaker 1: fuck shit up now because things are fast.

178
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:21,730
Speaker 0: I think you know, there's a company ZOTAC that specializes in making small computers.

179
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, they make some pretty good shoebox form factor But I think I might just buy like a complete system for them when the time comes.

180
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:35,139
Speaker 1: So the other thing I was looking at if I am confident that I can get away with not having take a look at the Next packs.

181
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:44,606
Speaker 1: They always have a booth Yeah but not having a real and video video card like if I'm if I'm comfortable that I can get away with like Even a core i7 on you just use the steam stream.

182
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:45,210
Speaker 0: It totally works.

183
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,877
Speaker 1: Yeah in that case I might get a core i5 or even it.

184
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,123
Speaker 1: like you can get a cheap i7.

185
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:59,089
Speaker 1: if you go with like lower numbers of cores And do the end the Intel onboard video and get a micro ITX and you get this tiny tiny tiny little thing.

186
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,630
Speaker 1: Because I don't really need the DVD playing capabilities anymore.

187
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:06,950
Speaker 1: So I don't which actually is the biggest thing other than the video card.

188
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:12,309
Speaker 1: So I might just make like the tiniest PC for my HD PC and be done with it.

189
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:17,130
Speaker 0: Let's just let me go to packs South as let's just check on the ZOTAC.

190
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:23,865
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz if you're willing to go down the road of micro ITX The pre-built systems are probably better put together than anything.

191
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,190
Speaker 1: You're gonna build yourself at that point.

192
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,730
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do if you build it yourself?

193
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,746
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna buy a bunch of stuff from ZOTAC and put it in a box and we're clumsily than they do.

194
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:34,338
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly But the answer is not what.

195
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,565
Speaker 0: do they have any competitors?

196
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,510
Speaker 0: Like I just know them.

197
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:43,050
Speaker 0: I don't actually know if they're any good I just know of them, you know, they compete with bad solutions like roku's or smart TVs or Xboxes.

198
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,238
Speaker 0: so there has to be someone else to make small computer bits.

199
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:54,379
Speaker 1: because if you guys didn't realize there's a lot of YouTube videos and Content that just don't show up if you don't have a real HD PC Like stuff's just not there when you search.

200
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,944
Speaker 1: I've been doing research on that.

201
00:11:56,686 --> 00:12:01,950
Speaker 1: So in other news Amazon, you know people a lot of people have been poo-pooing Amazon's drone delivery.

202
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,685
Speaker 1: But and you know Amazon had their little prototype.

203
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:11,110
Speaker 1: people like that's cute But it's fake and pretty much most industry people and normal people say that seems like something too far in the future.

204
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,918
Speaker 0: That won't happen.

205
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,847
Speaker 1: So Amazon are Driving cars and then Amazon was like, uh, yeah, we got one that works.

206
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:18,670
Speaker 1: Here it is.

207
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,870
Speaker 1: Here's video of it 15 mile range delivering real packages like for real autonomously.

208
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,527
Speaker 1: regulation is holding us back not technology.

209
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,117
Speaker 1: and Actually, it looks pretty cool.

210
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,170
Speaker 0: Are you within 15 miles of an Amazon warehouse?

211
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,929
Speaker 1: If I were Amazon, well 15 miles Scott hope it takes me.

212
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:40,206
Speaker 0: I'm like nine miles because I know there's an Amazon warehouse like in Jersey somewhere.

213
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,330
Speaker 0: Oh, no, that's a new egg warehouse.

214
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,955
Speaker 1: I'm whatever miles away from my office downtown.

215
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:45,778
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm like.

216
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:51,809
Speaker 1: so you could put platforms on top of like Four buildings in Queens and cover all the parts of Queens that matter?

217
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,369
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying is that you need to have the has to start at the warehouse or the goods are?

218
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,152
Speaker 1: well No, you have that.

219
00:12:57,172 --> 00:13:01,970
Speaker 1: you still have trucks delivering probably from the warehouses to like distribution centers.

220
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,410
Speaker 1: But instead of having that big-ass truck, you know go to a bunch of little trucks.

221
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,761
Speaker 1: The big-ass truck goes to a distribution center.

222
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,490
Speaker 1: that then goes to a whole bunch of little drones.

223
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,450
Speaker 0: So what do you do people throwing rocks at the drone?

224
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,365
Speaker 1: We'll solve that by just making it a crime.

225
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:17,796
Speaker 1: I Actually the rock problem.

226
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,025
Speaker 0: is there a way to trick the thing and to deliver?

227
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:20,446
Speaker 0: I see you got.

228
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,299
Speaker 0: you know, normally it's like Okay, it's got to land in my house.

229
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,545
Speaker 0: What if I'm not home?

230
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:25,530
Speaker 0: Is it ringing my doorbell?

231
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,283
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and you know what the the problem is.

232
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,410
Speaker 1: we could do a whole show on that.

233
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,876
Speaker 0: It's gonna land on my balcony.

234
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,463
Speaker 0: Is it gonna figure that out now?

235
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:33,850
Speaker 0: Can I help it figure that out?

236
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:42,110
Speaker 1: The problem is every time any tech blog is snowing any podcast any slash dot shithead talks about this topic.

237
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:53,626
Speaker 1: They'll ask questions like Scott's asking but they'll act like no one at Amazon ever thought of these things like yeah It's like they're like, oh I found this problem that you didn't already answer.

238
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,793
Speaker 0: I'll assume it's Unanswerable.

239
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,317
Speaker 0: there is no solution.

240
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,243
Speaker 0: I'm therefore this could never happen.

241
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:03,508
Speaker 1: I got this crazy idea for a horseless carriage but but what if?

242
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,059
Speaker 1: What if horses are still on the road?

243
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,626
Speaker 0: I mean it has a power from somewhere.

244
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:08,630
Speaker 0: Where does it get power from?

245
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,417
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did you think of that?

246
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:13,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you it's like, you know feed it like a horse you feed.

247
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,034
Speaker 0: Hey, it's like.

248
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,602
Speaker 1: yeah, I invented the horseless carriage.

249
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:16,809
Speaker 1: I've figured all that stuff out.

250
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,980
Speaker 0: So there's no gas stations yet.

251
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,059
Speaker 0: How you gonna get that again out?

252
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,828
Speaker 0: in New York, there's only gas station around.

253
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:35,910
Speaker 1: yeah I'm confident that Amazon has people whose sole job is to sit there all day Thinking about all the things that could go wrong with delivery drones.

254
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:37,569
Speaker 1: That probably a fun job.

255
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:40,586
Speaker 1: Actually, just sit there and be like what is it?

256
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,270
Speaker 1: X happens?

257
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,647
Speaker 0: That's a fine job if I didn't have to sit there for more than 40 hours a week.

258
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:48,401
Speaker 1: Yeah So, uh, what other?

259
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,675
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, so this is a cool thing I'm just going through.

260
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,846
Speaker 1: all my tech news is garbage technique.

261
00:14:53,228 --> 00:15:00,710
Speaker 1: formula E is a racing scene that pretty much no one except like super car nerds knows anything about or super nerd nerds, right?

262
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,432
Speaker 0: It's like the bet.

263
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:08,700
Speaker 0: basically, you know, there's Formula One which is the best and then the best But also problematic for everything is all.

264
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,844
Speaker 0: racing is problematic.

265
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:16,635
Speaker 0: But Formula E is like, alright fine We'll make another league, you know another racing, you know Championship.

266
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:28,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, where there's electric cars And basically instead of charging the batteries in the middle of the race you pull in and you jump the driver jumps out of the Car and jumps in the second already charged car.

267
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,217
Speaker 0: Otherwise the race wouldn't be long enough.

268
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:31,160
Speaker 1: now the problem with.

269
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,650
Speaker 1: well one of the problems with this all this kind of racing is that?

270
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:38,362
Speaker 1: You can't do a lot like there's a limiting factor in a lot of car racing.

271
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:40,870
Speaker 1: that's the human and the safety concerns.

272
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:44,904
Speaker 0: So Formula E was basically a lot of rules in Formula One that are pretty much like.

273
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,690
Speaker 0: you can't do this because you kill people.

274
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,497
Speaker 0: They're even thinking about making include, you know, it's open wheel, you know It's open wheel open cockpit racing

275
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,630
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of reasons for that for like competitiveness and whatever

276
00:15:55,891 --> 00:16:02,790
Speaker 0: They're considering like closing the cockpit on Formula One cars for safety reasons like put a little glass dome over your head or something.

277
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Formula E was just like, you know what?

278
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,054
Speaker 1: robot League Robot League.

279
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:10,617
Speaker 0: Yep.

280
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,304
Speaker 0: No more humans driving these cars.

281
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:13,670
Speaker 0: We'll let the cars drive themselves.

282
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,803
Speaker 1: Well, then so there I mean, we don't know the full time.

283
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,290
Speaker 0: He's not asking a bunch of stupid questions?

284
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:31,510
Speaker 1: I assume there's no answer for I Am excited for the idea of this show because then Formula One and other kinds of racing can showcase more like team tactics the human factors in the face of limitations.

285
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,606
Speaker 1: Formula E could go crazy.

286
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,749
Speaker 1: redline Nonsense, that's what I'm saying.

287
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,370
Speaker 1: Like the cars could have guns on if we wanted to like that could tell you got to worry about the spectator safety still.

288
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:45,319
Speaker 1: Yeah they solve that in all the movies about this.

289
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:52,616
Speaker 0: that also if you put guns on the cars it stops being less about racing more about Yeah, bad fighting but more like.

290
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:52,857
Speaker 1: so.

291
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:59,757
Speaker 1: ground-effects cars like f1 cars could be way way faster And we made they were way fast.

292
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,205
Speaker 0: Yeah ground-effects cars not even ground effects.

293
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:02,907
Speaker 0: We used to have like v10s.

294
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:11,839
Speaker 1: These things could have all of that and Even better if it's AI versus AI.

295
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:17,023
Speaker 1: a lot of people only watch f1 For highlights to see when crazy shit happens.

296
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:22,460
Speaker 1: a bunch of AI's Reacting in real time in souped up dangerous electric cars.

297
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:30,166
Speaker 1: crazy shit might go down like on a minute by minute basis Like the AI might just do something stupid eventually, but the thing is right.

298
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:41,410
Speaker 0: like all sports You're gonna approach like, you know maximum efficiency pretty rapidly if there's enough investment and you're just gonna see every car achieving It's maximum, you know lap time.

299
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,630
Speaker 0: It's its shortest possible race time and whichever one is the shortest possible race time will win.

300
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:59,662
Speaker 1: However, I will say this if AI gets advanced enough to where every car on the road is Driving perfectly in there won't be a situation where the car that gets the pole and The qualifying won't also win the race.

301
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,070
Speaker 0: It got around the track fastest.

302
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,719
Speaker 0: It can continue to get around like.

303
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,202
Speaker 0: imagine this.

304
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:04,490
Speaker 1: so say two of the AI cars.

305
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:10,690
Speaker 1: I have perfect knowledge of the perfect line and the fastest speed but one of them is in front of the other one.

306
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:13,148
Speaker 0: How did it get there if the other one was faster to begin with?

307
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:14,493
Speaker 1: So yeah, how?

308
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,060
Speaker 1: how do you do anything in f1?

309
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:20,425
Speaker 1: I mean right now in f1 you have the qualifications So they might be off like a microsecond.

310
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:21,089
Speaker 0: human errors.

311
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:21,730
Speaker 1: Yeah.

312
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,114
Speaker 1: So maybe a IRS.

313
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:30,008
Speaker 1: if we get AI that is perfect at this and there are no differentiating factors between them You get really boring.

314
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:38,802
Speaker 0: But that also means we have solved a lot of really complicated problems solved how to make a car go around a track as fast as possible.

315
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:53,240
Speaker 1: if the AIs are so perfect that the competition is Meaningless and comes down to random factors in Formula E with a eyes down the road That means that self-driving cars are the literal reality of the entire rest of the world At least the industrialized world at least rich people in the industrialized world.

316
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,490
Speaker 1: Hmm, but I'm looking forward to what actually comes out of this.

317
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,373
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

318
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:58,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna watch every race.

319
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cars that drive themselves.

320
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,890
Speaker 0: I'm watching every race every second.

321
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,346
Speaker 1: So I got one little thing here.

322
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:13,484
Speaker 1: Unicode, you know is the way you should be encoding text nowadays for a lot of reasons and Unicode has a lot of like smiley faces and things in it.

323
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:14,790
Speaker 1: There's a lot of characters in there.

324
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they've got so much space.

325
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:17,790
Speaker 0: They've already put all the human languages.

326
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:21,430
Speaker 0: So and emojis and emoticons are used by a lot of people.

327
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,140
Speaker 0: So why not put them in there?

328
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,770
Speaker 0: and they have been and it's been really helpful.

329
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:31,409
Speaker 1: Yeah It is really useful that I positive thing I can type an emoji on my Android phone and pretty much anyone.

330
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:38,910
Speaker 1: I send that message to on a phone a computer depending on their font anywhere in the world The symbol is transferred but not the graphic.

331
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:48,390
Speaker 1: So if Scott's on iPhone He's like angry cat guy looks a little bit different from my angry cat guy because the character is just defined as angry cat guy.

332
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,441
Speaker 0: Yeah, and your font determines what it actually looks like.

333
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:52,906
Speaker 1: So there's a consortia.

334
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:53,790
Speaker 0: all the normal letters.

335
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:03,574
Speaker 1: yeah, there is a consortia like Unicode is just like an example of a lot everything that is both good and overly bureaucratic with Technology standards.

336
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:08,690
Speaker 1: and there's a problem that has emerged that a lot of people never anticipated only recently.

337
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,990
Speaker 1: Companies like Nestle are trying to petition the consortium that decides what characters get.

338
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:16,656
Speaker 0: That's a good thing.

339
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,270
Speaker 0: The consortium isn't a commercial entity.

340
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:25,290
Speaker 1: Yeah with commercial interest to add their own trademarks and advertisements as Unicode characters.

341
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,001
Speaker 1: No, so Nestle wants a Kit Kat emoji.

342
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:31,750
Speaker 1: Taco Bell wants a Taco Bell taco emoji.

343
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,335
Speaker 1: Durex wants a condom.

344
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:36,504
Speaker 1: but supposedly well, I mean, I just want a generic condom.

345
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:37,287
Speaker 1: I do need.

346
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,711
Speaker 0: I'm okay with that Durex You're good.

347
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:39,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're good.

348
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:43,009
Speaker 0: But if Durex wanted a also Taco Bell, I think there's already a bell.

349
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,058
Speaker 0: so And if there's also a taco that's fine too.

350
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,683
Speaker 0: You can just go taco it followed by Bell.

351
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,850
Speaker 1: So here's my word Nestle.

352
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,223
Speaker 0: I think it's already a chocolate bar.

353
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:52,909
Speaker 0: So shove it.

354
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,652
Speaker 1: Here's my worry.

355
00:20:53,773 --> 00:21:06,460
Speaker 1: if you think that most people are don't care enough about local politics get involved that People who have too much power are involved and are controlling local politics Less people care about this than you can imagine.

356
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,395
Speaker 0: the people who care about this are also the people who care about The clocks being one second off.

357
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:16,994
Speaker 1: more people know who Bernie Sanders and Lawrence Lessig are Combined.

358
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,790
Speaker 1: then even know that there's a Unicode consortium.

359
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:26,935
Speaker 1: You're a rare unicorn Scott.

360
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,602
Speaker 0: so my worry is there a unicorn emoji?

361
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:36,502
Speaker 1: that consortium could probably be taken over by shady commercial interests trivially if people actually tried and that's bad news.

362
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:48,201
Speaker 1: and even if it isn't if these Pollutes that space the can of worms that opens is beyond Comprehension we're gonna have to replace Unicode with something else.

363
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:57,289
Speaker 1: Let's say I send a message I tweet something with the emoji for I don't know coca-cola like a coke a can of coca-cola.

364
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:04,625
Speaker 1: But I say hey wanna Pepsi Coca-cola would have to send me a trademark.

365
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:09,378
Speaker 1: C and D or Risk losing their rights to the trademark.

366
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:18,066
Speaker 0: I make a font and there's one of the characters is letter a another one Is the letter B things which are not owned by anybody and the third one is and the third one is 2012, right?

367
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:25,990
Speaker 0: So I have to make when I'm making my font a graphic for Ron Paul 2012, but I decide to make it a poop.

368
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,699
Speaker 1: So, I think that is the solution.

369
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,327
Speaker 1: it'd be we'll keep an eye on this.

370
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,644
Speaker 1: believe me I'm one of the people who will know if this shit happens.

371
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:41,710
Speaker 1: if it happens I call on everyone who makes fonts everyone who supports you anyone who makes any emoji arts any emoji?

372
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:49,498
Speaker 1: That is a trademark Hans should always be interpreted as a middle finger Or a poop or a middle finger and a I think.

373
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:53,070
Speaker 1: but yeah poop is better because middle finger isn't culturally universal.

374
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:54,513
Speaker 1: Poops pretty you know.

375
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,719
Speaker 0: or a poop with a trademark that T.M.

376
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:57,080
Speaker 0: Or goatee.

377
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:11,885
Speaker 1: Oh Anyway things of the day.

378
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:12,610
Speaker 1: what do you got for me?

379
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,170
Speaker 0: So, you know in Manhattan, it's not easy to get real estate.

380
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:20,144
Speaker 0: It's not even easy to rent even if it's commercial real estate.

381
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:20,867
Speaker 1: Well, it's got you.

382
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:21,410
Speaker 1: So guess what?

383
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,080
Speaker 1: Lakehole is gone can't couldn't afford the couldn't afford the rent.

384
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:28,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, $100 plus a table a head table restaurant.

385
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,846
Speaker 0: Well, there's a cook shortage I heard but that's a different story.

386
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:45,494
Speaker 0: Yeah But surprisingly in Manhattan, there's a lot of things that manage to stick around And seem to be unable to get pushed out despite the fact that rents go up and they're usually things that have some special way Of staying where they are.

387
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:49,630
Speaker 0: things like a church right as some special way to stay where it is.

388
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,554
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a landmark.

389
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:54,110
Speaker 0: Maybe someone just owns the property and it's not like renting.

390
00:23:54,452 --> 00:24:01,567
Speaker 1: There's a great article about why Chinatown still exists Even though that real estate is worth like a hundred times what it's being used for.

391
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,455
Speaker 0: Yep Things like that.

392
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,458
Speaker 0: So, you know theaters.

393
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,550
Speaker 0: they stay, you know, like even though theaters are making money anyway.

394
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:20,121
Speaker 0: And one of the things that tends to stay or like museums But also these really like specialized in tiny museum type thing Always go around and you'd be like what the hell is that.

395
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:24,696
Speaker 0: and it's like this really tiny thing and it's like oh That's the Museum of gangsters.

396
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:25,138
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:31,016
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's this tiny little thing and somehow it you know, no one goes to it But it keeps that spot and it just stays there.

398
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:42,930
Speaker 0: So another thing related to the museums are these libraries like these very specific Libraries like you'll see them if you walk around just like Christian Science Library and I think that partially uses the church exception.

399
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, also Christian Science is bullshit.

400
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,845
Speaker 0: It's nothing to do with science.

401
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:46,890
Speaker 0: Yeah away from that.

402
00:24:49,451 --> 00:24:51,199
Speaker 0: Not as bad as Scientology but bad.

403
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,550
Speaker 0: yeah, it's as bad as Seventh-day Adventist bad.

404
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,182
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're better off just going to Catholic Church or whatever than going there.

405
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,366
Speaker 1: Why not the orthodoxy?

406
00:24:58,587 --> 00:24:59,370
Speaker 0: sure you can go there, too.

407
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,278
Speaker 0: It's better better than Christian Science.

408
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:02,022
Speaker 1: Oh see man.

409
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,890
Speaker 0: Christian Science is all like don't take medicine.

410
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,922
Speaker 0: But anyway, you'll also see ones like.

411
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:13,320
Speaker 0: I think there's like a Swedish like Specific like library kind of thing.

412
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,509
Speaker 0: I saw ones, you know, you see stuff like that.

413
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:24,100
Speaker 0: but there's one I did not know about probably cuz I never walked past where it is and It is called the conjuring arts Resource Center.

414
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,183
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

415
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:26,326
Speaker 1: That sounds Lovecraftian.

416
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:33,170
Speaker 0: It is a library that contains 11,000 books about magic and its Allied arts.

417
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:39,190
Speaker 1: Whoa, if I if high school rim had found that place high school rim would have applied to work there.

418
00:25:40,031 --> 00:25:47,149
Speaker 0: Right, so apparently that's there and Yeah, so I didn't know it was there.

419
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:56,280
Speaker 0: but if you need to study magic don't go to the regular library go to the magic specific library and you could learn some cups And balls or some son lady in half or worse.

420
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,648
Speaker 1: That is actually super awesome.

421
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,997
Speaker 0: Yeah Usually, I don't know.

422
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:07,710
Speaker 0: sometimes these I don't know how this one works A lot of them work differently like sometimes you can go in and read all you want, but you can't take anything out.

423
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,104
Speaker 0: Sometimes you got to be a member to even walk in.

424
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:10,889
Speaker 0: so they're all you know.

425
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:16,732
Speaker 0: Yeah I guess you can go to their website and get some infos if you actually want to go there and you're in Manhattan and you Care about magic.

426
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:17,354
Speaker 1: I'm going there.

427
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:18,558
Speaker 0: What are you gonna learn there?

428
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,381
Speaker 0: I don't know magic.

429
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:20,686
Speaker 0: You're gonna learn magic.

430
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:21,790
Speaker 0: What are you gonna learn?

431
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,504
Speaker 0: I know magic magic missile.

432
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:30,890
Speaker 1: I Dude, can you hope you know how much damage 1d 4 plus 1 is on a human a level zero commoner?

433
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,067
Speaker 1: That's death for most people.

434
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:34,956
Speaker 0: All right, well they're not.

435
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:35,257
Speaker 0: they're not.

436
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:36,301
Speaker 0: obviously not letting you in.

437
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,329
Speaker 1: magic missile never misses either.

438
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:47,546
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I have a quote to you for you But from an article about the video that is my thing of the day.

439
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,196
Speaker 1: quote the battery pack.

440
00:26:50,297 --> 00:27:00,250
Speaker 1: living inside this thing is a literal pack of rechargeable double-a batteries soldered and taped together into an amalgam of electricity and regrets.

441
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,290
Speaker 0: So first of all, if you don't realize this already, you know when you get a battery pack.

442
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:10,730
Speaker 0: It's like batteries come in cells the same way that your double A's and your C's and your all your trip.

443
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,441
Speaker 1: I like you buy a little bit laptop battery.

444
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:15,192
Speaker 1: It'll say like this is the six cell Cell.

445
00:27:15,374 --> 00:27:17,004
Speaker 0: take your laptop battery and open it up.

446
00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:17,849
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

447
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,018
Speaker 1: Okay, don't actually open it.

448
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:24,719
Speaker 0: But yeah, but if you if you opened it up, you know It's in there a bunch of batteries all end-to-end.

449
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:27,630
Speaker 0: Yeah in rows and they look like normal batteries.

450
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,150
Speaker 0: They're just usually like solid color and full of lithium and yep, but they're like tested together.

451
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,690
Speaker 1: They're embedded in like usually some sort of like heavy usually some circuit board controlling them, right?

452
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:37,012
Speaker 0: You're not.

453
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,670
Speaker 0: it's not like when you put a double-a battery in your TV remote.

454
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,785
Speaker 0: The double-a battery is going right into your remote, but there is you.

455
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:43,489
Speaker 1: there's like a power.

456
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:45,699
Speaker 1: Well, there's there's something there.

457
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:48,070
Speaker 0: There's some sort of capacitor regulator kind of thing.

458
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not.

459
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:57,230
Speaker 0: when you have a battery pack Usually, you know, there's some sort of circuit board in between all those cells and your laptop right inside the battery.

460
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:05,489
Speaker 1: This is a dude who just does like teardowns like he'll take apart technology and be like, hey here's the thing and I'm gonna take it apart and tear it down and tell you how it worked.

461
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:10,070
Speaker 1: and He has these ones about like embedded computers and tablock tablet computers and whatever.

462
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,449
Speaker 1: But this video is kind of special.

463
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:19,050
Speaker 1: This is like a specialized tablet computer that was sold as a product for people to use in a professional setting.

464
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:28,050
Speaker 0: Yes, I mean we already know that like medical devices and medical can you know are like the worst the asinomad Infoview medical tablet computer.

465
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:34,770
Speaker 1: I guess it was used in hospitals for medical data and doctors and nurses and things and probably starting fires.

466
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,262
Speaker 1: Probably so he does his usual thing.

467
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,770
Speaker 1: Like he's opening this thing and he's like, oh, well, there's a board like this.

468
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,143
Speaker 1: There's a board like this and this video increasingly goes off the rails.

469
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,710
Speaker 0: I laughed so hard at work.

470
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,559
Speaker 1: It's like this is a dog's breakfast.

471
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,004
Speaker 1: is what we got in here like.

472
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:54,048
Speaker 1: he cannot believe What is going on in here and he finds?

473
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:58,650
Speaker 1: Bad cells like, you know the kinds of cell like, you know, those cells God was talking about.

474
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:04,011
Speaker 1: They kind of look like a regular like double-a battery, but they're not a regular double-a battery Like you.

475
00:29:04,031 --> 00:29:14,190
Speaker 1: don't just put those in something now and he has soldered them together and wrapped tape around them Like jumbled in like laying on top of the motherboard.

476
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:21,476
Speaker 1: There's like two of them and then there's a third one like off somewhere else, but he keeps saying like oh, there's a battery pack There's a normal battery pack.

477
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:22,641
Speaker 1: and then this bullshit.

478
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:28,403
Speaker 1: and as he's getting deeper and deeper into this thing He starts getting more and more suspicious of that quote battery pack.

479
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:32,745
Speaker 1: and when he opens it This video is just great.

480
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:35,782
Speaker 1: This is also why.

481
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:37,350
Speaker 0: so keep in mind when you go to the hospital.

482
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,325
Speaker 0: This is the sort of equipment your life depends upon.

483
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:48,107
Speaker 1: Yep this is the kind of equipment that I used to have to deploy in hospitals, which is why I Quit that job and burned every bridge I had as I walked out the door.

484
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:49,372
Speaker 1: flip it everybody Burn it.

485
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:50,616
Speaker 0: This is gonna burn itself.

486
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:54,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I did was leave in a cenomed tablet computer on the bridge.

487
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:59,604
Speaker 1: In the moment the book club book was the wheel of time.

488
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:00,709
Speaker 1: I just read the fifth book.

489
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:03,870
Speaker 0: I Started reading the fifth book and I haven't read any in a long time.

490
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,710
Speaker 0: You could probably listen to geek night's episodes and figure out when I started and stopped reading that fifth book.

491
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,060
Speaker 1: We'll start a new book club book.

492
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,310
Speaker 1: That isn't the wheel of time soon.

493
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,675
Speaker 1: I actually know what it's gonna be now.

494
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:16,070
Speaker 1: that book that we talked about on the last interview show we did.

495
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,018
Speaker 1: You remember that book?

496
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,569
Speaker 1: no sounded like a really good book.

497
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:24,065
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe I'm remembering a bit now with Joe with Joe food.

498
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:24,326
Speaker 1: Yeah.

499
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:24,988
Speaker 1: Yeah that one.

500
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,831
Speaker 1: That's the book I'm gonna do.

501
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:26,715
Speaker 1: I think okay.

502
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:30,450
Speaker 1: So otherwise, we're gonna be at magfest on a bunch of panels.

503
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:32,494
Speaker 1: They're not public yet.

504
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:34,622
Speaker 0: I got to arrange all kinds of transportation.

505
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:43,147
Speaker 1: if you back us on patreon I posted a preview of the panels were likely to be on even though that's not otherwise generally public information.

506
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:43,649
Speaker 1: So there you go.

507
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,418
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're probably gonna be back south.

508
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,444
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna be a pax east.

509
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,250
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna be an anime Boston.

510
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,314
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna be a kinetic on.

511
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:52,459
Speaker 1: I think that's far enough out.

512
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,970
Speaker 1: push in July packs prime packs prime.

513
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,976
Speaker 0: That's the convention schedule for next year.

514
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,465
Speaker 1: then magfest again pecks out or pecks ass.

515
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:00,990
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna do pecks ass.

516
00:31:01,712 --> 00:31:03,699
Speaker 0: I was thinking about going to Essen next year.

517
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,542
Speaker 1: I won't do both.

518
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:05,887
Speaker 0: I can't afford that.

519
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:06,810
Speaker 0: You want to give me a bunch of money?

520
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,514
Speaker 1: No, why don't you patreon?

521
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,540
Speaker 0: you want to like quintuple your investment?

522
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, send me to Essen and packs ass.

523
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,860
Speaker 1: Oh and also for our Tuesday listeners David Peterson finally posted.

524
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:26,990
Speaker 1: we helped him and Lou Crane make a bunch of videos around the Mouse guard swords and strongholds board game the board game that the mice play in the mouse guard comics, right?

525
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:34,686
Speaker 0: So if you had any rules questions about those games We help produce some videos that explain every conceivable possible rule scenario.

526
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:37,757
Speaker 0: in case you don't want to read the rules You just watch these videos instead.

527
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:39,484
Speaker 1: There is one scenario.

528
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,930
Speaker 1: We do not describe.

529
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:49,652
Speaker 1: No, we knew because we I have the video where we all talked about the scenario and agreed that there's literally no reason to explain That scenario.

530
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:56,362
Speaker 1: Okay, the one where what if I need to put a mouse back on the board with my rescue?

531
00:31:56,382 --> 00:32:02,676
Speaker 1: and There's literally because there are four strongholds blocking the other side.

532
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:04,964
Speaker 1: There is no legal place for me to put it.

533
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:05,927
Speaker 0: You're already in bad shape.

534
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:14,468
Speaker 1: Yeah So There are always rumors about what Apple's gonna do next and you know A lot of them are just complete BS unless you know where to look.

535
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:27,283
Speaker 1: but the most recent rumor is one that has been a perennial rumor with Apple that they're gonna remove the headphone jack from their blank and This yeah, everyone's acting like they never heard this story before.

536
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:28,830
Speaker 0: we heard this story like two years ago.

537
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:29,768
Speaker 0: This is not a new story.

538
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:30,492
Speaker 1: Yeah Didn't they?

539
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:35,270
Speaker 1: they actually put on a mini TRS jack on an iPod at one point?

540
00:32:35,772 --> 00:32:39,205
Speaker 1: Like I remember that happening or something rumblings happening about that.

541
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,390
Speaker 0: I know I remember that ever.

542
00:32:40,974 --> 00:32:42,870
Speaker 1: I mean iPods are ancient technology anyway.

543
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:55,540
Speaker 1: Yeah iPods have always had the regular headphone home, but it's actually an interesting question because the TRS standard or at least the you know The headphone jack that as you know, it is called TRS.

544
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:56,042
Speaker 1: Yeah.

545
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:59,250
Speaker 1: Well TRS is the you know tip ring shield sleeve.

546
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:01,964
Speaker 1: I've heard sleeve or shield in desert.

547
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,051
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter It's.

548
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:03,293
Speaker 0: it's.

549
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:15,530
Speaker 0: that's what it stands for because the plug has a tip Then this sort of black separator than a ring a metal ring Oh then another little separator and then the sleeve or the shield, right?

550
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:23,470
Speaker 0: And then so it's these three pieces of metal and when you shove it in the socket It connects in three places to your device.

551
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:30,510
Speaker 1: Right and it existed because that shape was actually really easy to make and be super reliable.

552
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:33,930
Speaker 1: Right was really easy to connect to a very simple cable, right?

553
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,029
Speaker 0: And the best thing about it is that the tip has like this indent in it.

554
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:50,287
Speaker 0: So in the inside of your hole, there's some little pushers that push inwards and when the tip makes it past the pushers They they lock in behind the tip keeping that headphone jack sort of in there.

555
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:51,350
Speaker 0: pretty good, right?

556
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,893
Speaker 0: It's like it's not.

557
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,329
Speaker 0: you got to you know, apply some force to yank it out.

558
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:54,771
Speaker 0: Yeah,

559
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:55,957
Speaker 1: and the contacts are not

560
00:33:56,037 --> 00:34:05,015
Speaker 0: just like a loosey, you know, that's why when you put your headphones You know into the into the hole it goes click and then it clicks to come out is because the shape of the tip and these Little pushers on the inside

561
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:12,303
Speaker 1: and also the contacts are real big get a really good connection there Which is important because for audio purposes, that's analog information.

562
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:12,985
Speaker 1: It's not digital.

563
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,290
Speaker 1: There's no error correction, right?

564
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,197
Speaker 0: It's an analog audio signal.

565
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:19,790
Speaker 0: it can you know, it's already been amplified right to what it's gonna be.

566
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:25,753
Speaker 0: You just need to send it to some speakers and you can hear it, you know, so it's pretty much, you know What is the speaker?

567
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:33,670
Speaker 0: It's a magnet that just moves back and forth, you know pushing a thing to make the air move to make Sound that's the same as a model own just in the opposite action exactly.

568
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:40,612
Speaker 0: So if your speaker is got, you know, if someone's creating like a you know, I don't know a hundred Hertz tone You know.

569
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:42,916
Speaker 0: then if you look at that electric signal, what is it?

570
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:45,260
Speaker 0: It's an electric wave that's going at a hundred Hertz.

571
00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:49,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, then you make a thing move at a hundred Hertz and then it makes that sound.

572
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,924
Speaker 0: That's how it works.

573
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:56,081
Speaker 0: So when you have the tip ring and sleeve the sleeve is ground because electricity Right.

574
00:34:56,101 --> 00:35:02,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the tip and ring are left and right because it's stereo Which is lossy.

575
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:08,404
Speaker 1: because the other way to use that kind of cable is a balanced connection where you're only sending one channel So it's mono.

576
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:15,148
Speaker 1: but it's actually so ethernet cables at least up through like hundred megabit They do pretty much the exact same thing.

577
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,091
Speaker 1: is what I'm about to describe.

578
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:18,559
Speaker 1: you send the same data over both.

579
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:22,720
Speaker 1: So the tip and the ring both have the same data, but you invert one of them, right?

580
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,734
Speaker 0: So when one says one the other one says zero.

581
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:25,500
Speaker 0: at the same time.

582
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:31,440
Speaker 1: It's more like because one says thirty eight point nine seven and the other one says forty one point four five because it's analog.

583
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:36,380
Speaker 0: Yes, yeah, but then at the other end because they're the exact opposite of each other, right?

584
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:46,753
Speaker 1: It's you can pretty much a hundred percent and detect any errors or mistakes Because say you add 20 to one spot because there was like a EMP went off somewhere like nukes are happening.

585
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:59,720
Speaker 1: an EMP went by and a plus 20 Got added to this one like microsecond in your signal at the other end You see there's a plus 20 on top of a signal on one end and there's also a plus 20 on the other end.

586
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:08,802
Speaker 0: So basically so something that started off is negative 2. positive 2 is now Neg, you know negative it's 18 and 22.

587
00:36:08,802 --> 00:36:17,720
Speaker 1: So you're like, aha that must have been a - yeah Because if you take the two signals and overlay them on each other they turn into zero plus all the noise.

588
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:22,450
Speaker 1: So basically you get a track now That is just the noise and you can remove it.

589
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:33,260
Speaker 0: and that is why balanced audio cables are the best thing in the world But those don't devices on either end after you actually do that and you would need like tip ring ring ring sleeve.

590
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why XLR cables.

591
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,332
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

592
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:45,446
Speaker 1: It's just three pins instead of a tip and a ring Doing the exact same thing, but balanced audio is not used by any of you Unless you have a mixer and some audio.

593
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:49,220
Speaker 0: so and there's no reason to because really how much interference are you dealing with and walking?

594
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,882
Speaker 0: Around none.

595
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't hear any difference using.

596
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus you've got a short cable and some shitty headphones.

597
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:56,328
Speaker 1: So it doesn't really matter.

598
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,180
Speaker 1: that doesn't matter if you have fancy headphones.

599
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,501
Speaker 1: They don't.

600
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:03,580
Speaker 0: don't start believing some audiophile nonsense that you got to use balanced cables for your everyday audio listening.

601
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:09,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're audio producing most of the time your devices don't support that anyway like you can.

602
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:13,580
Speaker 0: yeah So, you know, so it's an audiophile devices often don't support.

603
00:37:14,102 --> 00:37:35,868
Speaker 1: So TRS is important though because there's some debate about this and I'm not going to weigh in on whether or not this Statement is correct, but a lot of people have posited that the TRS audio standard So that jack and that socket and that format of sending audio analog audio Might be the longest live technical Specification in consumer device history

604
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:38,014
Speaker 0: even old even older than like the phone jack.

605
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:39,619
Speaker 1: It is basically a phone jack.

606
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:43,171
Speaker 1: Before our modern rj11 phone jack existed.

607
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:44,416
Speaker 0: really it's older than rj11.

608
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:48,628
Speaker 1: Yeah Read the Wikipedia article on this is cut.

609
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,710
Speaker 1: It's not called TRS.

610
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,733
Speaker 1: TRS is a use of it.

611
00:37:51,054 --> 00:37:52,438
Speaker 1: It's called phone jack.

612
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,053
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, that's news to me.

613
00:37:56,342 --> 00:38:00,698
Speaker 0: Something else you may have noticed is that like newer headphones and newer phones and things in general.

614
00:38:00,718 --> 00:38:04,189
Speaker 0: have Tip ring ring sleeves extra ring on there.

615
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,998
Speaker 1: There's some like T tip ring ring ring ring like.

616
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:07,440
Speaker 1: there's a lot.

617
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,705
Speaker 0: I've only seen two ring.

618
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:10,612
Speaker 0: I've never seen anything more than two ring.

619
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,158
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I've seen TRRS.

620
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:13,867
Speaker 0: I've only seen TR.

621
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:14,753
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look that up.

622
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:15,799
Speaker 1: I see TRS here.

623
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:18,451
Speaker 0: So TRS is basically an extra ring.

624
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,420
Speaker 0: and what do you do with that extra ring?

625
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,612
Speaker 0: They're not doing balanced audio because it's nonsense right?

626
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:24,475
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

627
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:24,977
Speaker 1: There it is.

628
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:25,580
Speaker 1: There's TR.

629
00:38:26,481 --> 00:38:33,100
Speaker 0: Okay, what they're doing with the second extra additional ring is first of all, it's fully backwards compatible with the one ring.

630
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,900
Speaker 0: Right, it's like if you take a tip ring ring sleeve headphone and put it in an old iPod that only supports tip ring sleeve.

631
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:46,834
Speaker 0: It's gonna play just fine because it's gonna line up with either ring and it doesn't give a shit.

632
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:50,028
Speaker 1: and it's elegant because the way It works in the modern era.

633
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:58,520
Speaker 1: I mean think if you've got a mono Device just because you have like like one speaker or something You can plug a mono cable into there and it'll just work.

634
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:05,208
Speaker 0: It's gonna be touching both halves of the stereo part and combining them, you know Well, there's a little more.

635
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,620
Speaker 0: nor maybe you'll only hear left or maybe you'll only hear right?

636
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:16,952
Speaker 1: I do not want to get into what happens there because actually with old devices you could kill yourself but Basically, it just works in the modern era.

637
00:39:17,032 --> 00:39:17,455
Speaker 0: That's good.

638
00:39:17,495 --> 00:39:18,279
Speaker 1: That's what you need to know.

639
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,500
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the tip the extra ring there.

640
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:33,919
Speaker 0: that's how you that's how on your little fancy iPhone headphones like I have you've got a little microphone on there and you could push Buttons to like, you know Make the track go forward or play pause or make volume up and down.

641
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,745
Speaker 0: Is that so the extra ring is doing?

642
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:40,560
Speaker 0: the extra ring is going the opposite direction in your iPhones or your regular phones or Android?

643
00:39:40,664 --> 00:39:41,018
Speaker 0: phones.

644
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:42,787
Speaker 0: That extra ring is not.

645
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,578
Speaker 0: they're not sending anything out on that ring unless you know.

646
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:53,729
Speaker 0: You know if you start talking to someone on the phone They'll just send that to the tip in the first ring because you're listening to it and your ears They don't need to use that right?

647
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:55,340
Speaker 0: The third ring is going the opposite way.

648
00:39:55,681 --> 00:40:15,186
Speaker 0: it's a microphone and when you push like the volume up button, it's actually creating little sounds and Sending those sounds to the phone like you said something only you can't talk like a modem going To make it volume go up Right and then the phone hears that and goes aha I guess I'll make the volume go up.

649
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:18,580
Speaker 0: Someone said to turn the volume up on the microphone hole on the second ring.

650
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,728
Speaker 1: so Think about what this means.

651
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:24,240
Speaker 1: I can take the newest iPhone.

652
00:40:25,101 --> 00:40:27,349
Speaker 1: I can take the first Walkman.

653
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:40,359
Speaker 0: I can plug any pair of Headphones that were news beats and plug them into the oldest Sony Walkman and I could take the headphones that came with that oldest Sony Walkman and plug them into the newest iPhone and they'll all work.

654
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,397
Speaker 1: That's a big deal because headphones might be like very well constructed like if you get good headphones, but they're dumb devices.

655
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:51,128
Speaker 1: They're just a Physical thing that responds to electricity.

656
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:54,480
Speaker 1: They're driven by the DAC in the device.

657
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:55,489
Speaker 1: The device was smart.

658
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:56,760
Speaker 1: the headphones were dumb, right?

659
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,186
Speaker 0: See in the olden days you didn't even need a DAC because like you have a cassette player with a Walkman The audio is already analog.

660
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:07,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just reading the analog audio from the tape and playing it with the amplifier.

661
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,303
Speaker 0: Walkman does.

662
00:41:09,323 --> 00:41:13,680
Speaker 0: it doesn't do anything else is the tape reader, but nowadays you got an mp3 player.

663
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:29,379
Speaker 0: You're converting those digital You know sounds into an analog sound and then sending that analog sound through an amplifier not the headphone hole But because we have that line of differentiation where the standard this TRS is used these quarter inch or eighth inch jacks.

664
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,597
Speaker 1: I think they're officially defined in millimeter terms.

665
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:32,322
Speaker 0: now Whatever.

666
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:36,618
Speaker 1: but or you get the two and a half millimeter that some like bullshit phones used to use my ti-86 head.

667
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,873
Speaker 1: I mean, well because they use that for data.

668
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:44,109
Speaker 0: I think the Xbox 360 headset uses a tiny one also.

669
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:46,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got adapters for the tiny one for my rig.

670
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:52,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, but because like because that standard it was almost like an abstraction layer in code.

671
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:53,740
Speaker 1: like because we've got that there.

672
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,509
Speaker 1: It's like an interface.

673
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,859
Speaker 1: Well, it is an interface Literally is an interface.

674
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:07,288
Speaker 1: So doesn't matter what's on the other side of it because the same thing comes out and every device that plays audio pretty much in the world Will work with this.

675
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,756
Speaker 1: headphones work everywhere.

676
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,017
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

677
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,186
Speaker 1: but The problem with it.

678
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:17,810
Speaker 1: as far as Apple has been concerned and they have been concerned about this They can't make their phone thinner.

679
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,176
Speaker 0: No, and they've made.

680
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:22,620
Speaker 1: it is too big And in fact Apple has been so obsessed with it made it thinner.

681
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,160
Speaker 0: They even push the camera out the back a little bit to make the phone thinner.

682
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:41,690
Speaker 1: But I found all these articles about patents and old work Apple has been doing for a long time To try to hack around to get a smaller version of these TRS eighth inch connectors Make the phone thinner and make you use a stupid adapter.

683
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, they designed one.

684
00:42:43,016 --> 00:42:46,680
Speaker 1: That's the same thing Except one side of it is cut flat.

685
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:54,662
Speaker 1: So it's like cut in two along the length just to make it thinner But otherwise work the same way and have one pusher on the top only Like.

686
00:42:54,702 --> 00:43:01,302
Speaker 1: that's how obsessed they were with this and the rumor is that Apple is finally going to with the iPhone 7.

687
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:04,200
Speaker 1: Just force you to use Thunderbolt and that's where the audio comes out, right?

688
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,203
Speaker 0: So here's the issue here.

689
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:09,956
Speaker 0: the people were if you remember the older iPhones before they invented lightning cables.

690
00:43:09,996 --> 00:43:11,260
Speaker 0: their lightning Thunderbolt is different.

691
00:43:11,442 --> 00:43:17,620
Speaker 0: Yeah before they invented the lightning cable They had the dock connector, which is like this big wide rectangle kind of thing.

692
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:20,479
Speaker 0: That was only one, you know, and it had a million pins on it.

693
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:28,400
Speaker 0: The dock connector was actually really fancy in that there was a lot of things on those pins Including analog audio output.

694
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:40,258
Speaker 0: so like they also sent the analog audio out a few of those pins and that's why you could easily take an old iPod and Put it on a dock and they you know a dock with speakers and could just play music because it would.

695
00:43:40,278 --> 00:43:42,407
Speaker 0: just you know There was like extra headphone hole.

696
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:45,360
Speaker 0: That was a weird shape on the bottom of it in addition to the one on the top.

697
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,785
Speaker 1: That's why that dock was cheap.

698
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:49,656
Speaker 0: The dock was stupid right as far as I'm aware.

699
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:54,019
Speaker 0: the lightning connector I could be wrong does not have analog audio output on it.

700
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:58,420
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's a digital only connector like a serial USB kind of connector.

701
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,363
Speaker 0: We could look that up.

702
00:44:00,423 --> 00:44:01,165
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm wrong.

703
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:12,494
Speaker 0: I think you're right from what I mean means now if you have lightning headphones What used to happen was the phone would convert the digital sound into the analog signal.

704
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:14,038
Speaker 0: the amplifier would be in your phone.

705
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,587
Speaker 0: now By you're gonna have to buy an adapter.

706
00:44:17,627 --> 00:44:34,095
Speaker 0: that isn't just some dumb shape changing metal connecting thing for there's gonna be a circuit in There's gonna be a digital to analog, you know processing device and Either the adapter or if your headphones have a lightning cable in your headphones.

707
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:37,239
Speaker 0: and now suddenly This is a whole different.

708
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:43,869
Speaker 0: Headphones are no longer to some a speaker with a wire coming out of it Like every speaker has been for the history of speakers.

709
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,270
Speaker 1: Now.

710
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:45,413
Speaker 1: This is not a new problem.

711
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:52,580
Speaker 0: This has happened with serial ports The digital analog converter and possibly an amplifier in your headphones.

712
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:59,326
Speaker 1: Like a lot of devices if you need to just connect something to a computer to send and receive data Way easier and cheaper.

713
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:00,651
Speaker 0: and does this mean your head?

714
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:02,438
Speaker 0: does this mean your headphones need power to?

715
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:13,359
Speaker 0: yeah well, they're gonna get power from the lightning because you can get power from the lightning connector because that's how the The the pencil charges the pan charges off the lightning connector so you can definitely get power from it.

716
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:20,920
Speaker 1: So in the old days with devices you use serial ports because you can just send and receive data and Trivially implement that like in hardware.

717
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:25,460
Speaker 0: But the device that's using the serial port needed power from somewhere cuz serial ports didn't give power.

718
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,039
Speaker 0: This is why the USB they added power to USB.

719
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:37,237
Speaker 1: But for a small device if you want to use USB as your serial bus You've got to implement the fucking USB stack with a chip on your device.

720
00:45:37,377 --> 00:45:41,780
Speaker 1: Yep serial You could just take a bunch of Nang gates in there if you really wanted to and go to town.

721
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,314
Speaker 0: You just needed a double-a batteries.

722
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:58,318
Speaker 1: Yeah But in terms of like you could you could implement the signaling stuff without having to implement a semi software stack of USB and get a UUID and all that nonsense or GUI do whatever whatever.

723
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:03,305
Speaker 1: so It would be interesting if Apple did this Because it would.

724
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:06,139
Speaker 0: you're gonna charge your arm and a leg for an adapter, which is their favorite thing to do.

725
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:12,297
Speaker 1: Well, it'll also start locking you in because as soon as you buy lightning headphones You can't go back to Android.

726
00:46:12,317 --> 00:46:12,519
Speaker 1: now.

727
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:18,882
Speaker 0: Well, you buy your lightning headphones and you buy a $50 adapter to turn lightning into tip ring sleeve to use it with something Else.

728
00:46:19,063 --> 00:46:25,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then if you don't buy lightning headphones You're gonna have to buy a $50 adapter to use regular headphones with iPhone 7.

729
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:32,380
Speaker 1: But it might be moot because I suspect most people are going toward Bluetooth if they have iPhones.

730
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:38,940
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah I don't know why Apple doesn't just get rid of the connector entirely and say Bluetooth headphones everyone and make some fucking good ones.

731
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,119
Speaker 0: Cuz no one makes any good ones.

732
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:43,933
Speaker 0: Yeah Someone's gonna tell me that someone does make good ones and you're wrong cuz.

733
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:46,824
Speaker 0: I've tried a lot of them and they all have problems I still use.

734
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:56,679
Speaker 1: I actually stopped using the old animotics because they're just too fragile and now I just have some sure Isolation earbuds with a TRS connector on the end and they work great.

735
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,054
Speaker 1: But it's interesting because this dance has happened a few times.

736
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:10,420
Speaker 1: and with the serial port thing Serial ports are still around and a lot of things still use them because USB is inadequate even today.

737
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:15,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of switches a lot of routers a lot of embedded devices a lot of research devices.

738
00:47:15,822 --> 00:47:22,576
Speaker 1: That's why even now you can buy a PCI Express Card that just has four serial ports sticking out of the bag.

739
00:47:22,596 --> 00:47:23,319
Speaker 0: a fun thing to do.

740
00:47:23,722 --> 00:47:26,720
Speaker 0: Just install Linux on a computer just any kind of Linux even Ubuntu.

741
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,687
Speaker 0: Oh, how many kids even know this.

742
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:40,295
Speaker 0: and if by default it's going to run a terminal Right device on the serial port Usually the first one if you take like a VT 100 or something some serial device or

743
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:44,374
Speaker 1: even just get an old Windows computer Or something and just connect to it with a normal

744
00:47:44,414 --> 00:47:45,078
Speaker 0: mini-com.

745
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:47,814
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, or you know any or even putty.

746
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:48,860
Speaker 0: you can probably do it, right?

747
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:58,007
Speaker 0: And just connect a cable to that serial port to a terminal either a virtual or hardware terminal and boop They you'll turn it on and there's a login.

748
00:47:58,228 --> 00:47:59,854
Speaker 0: It'll be like, you know login username.

749
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, there it is.

750
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,548
Speaker 0: Just log it on the serial port.

751
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:05,976
Speaker 0: cuz back in the day, that's how computers worked.

752
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:06,940
Speaker 0: it you'd go to a school.

753
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:12,179
Speaker 0: There'd be one computer running Unix and there'd be a whole bunch of terminals.

754
00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:16,092
Speaker 0: This and all those terminals had a serial cable connected to the computer.

755
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:17,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were terminals.

756
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:18,460
Speaker 1: They were not computers.

757
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:19,560
Speaker 1: There was not much going on.

758
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,160
Speaker 1: They could not do stuff on their own and you can do the same thing.

759
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,584
Speaker 0: You can take your computer and get a whole bunch of terminals plugged into it if you have enough serial connectors even use.

760
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:34,529
Speaker 0: you can even use USB to do this if you set it up and Everyone can use the same computer and all login is their own users.

761
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,406
Speaker 0: One person can when you SSH in.

762
00:48:37,446 --> 00:48:37,870
Speaker 0: what do you think?

763
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,231
Speaker 0: It does.

764
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:42,065
Speaker 0: it creates a terminal on a device and sends it over the network.

765
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:43,350
Speaker 0: That's all it's doing.

766
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,003
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if this rumor is true or not.

767
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:47,726
Speaker 1: I give it pretty much 50/50 odds.

768
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:54,550
Speaker 0: I mean the last time it had either the rumor came about I said, yeah, that's believable Yeah, and now it's coming about again even stronger.

769
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:55,616
Speaker 0: so it's still believable.

770
00:48:55,697 --> 00:49:08,433
Speaker 0: but what tends to happen with the Apple rumors is Most of them are actually Seem to be true that there aren't usually a lot of bullshit ones unless you read like really dumb websites, right and ones that are Seemingly wrong.

771
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:10,018
Speaker 0: like Apple didn't make a television.

772
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:11,743
Speaker 0: They just updated the Apple TV and stuff.

773
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:13,368
Speaker 0: They're usually right.

774
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:19,510
Speaker 0: eventually There's an is to die truth in there like Apple watch was a rumor for many years.

775
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,955
Speaker 0: And then what happened eventually?

776
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:22,520
Speaker 0: Apple watch there at the same time.

777
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:26,586
Speaker 1: By that logic there are rumors about pretty much every stupid thing.

778
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:27,270
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen.

779
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:32,469
Speaker 1: So wait, which ones I'm so people were talking about smartwatches 20 years ago.

780
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,110
Speaker 1: Sure, like I mean from the first iPhone there was probably some crack powders like there's gonna be an Apple watch.

781
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:39,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Apple made a camera.

782
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:44,003
Speaker 0: There's a digital camera and it wasn't in any phone and whatsoever.

783
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:44,947
Speaker 0: It's a whole camera.

784
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,409
Speaker 0: Apple made printers Apple made all kinds of the people don't remember.

785
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:57,930
Speaker 1: but Basically, if you're a nerd or a geek like us if you don't know how headphone cables work I'd actually suggest read this Wikipedia article.

786
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,035
Speaker 0: Also, do you remember that?

787
00:50:00,316 --> 00:50:04,467
Speaker 0: You know, they're big ones to the same tip ring sleeve, but quarter-inch but big.

788
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:05,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a thing.

789
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:10,268
Speaker 1: In fact, not only is that a thing but that's still you still use.

790
00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:10,650
Speaker 0: why not?

791
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:12,216
Speaker 1: Did you buy a good pair of headphones?

792
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:24,070
Speaker 1: That's all it comes with usually because well usually will come with the adapter also Yeah, but if you have a good pair of headphones like for real headphones You're probably plugging them into a for real device like an actual mixing console or something.

793
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:26,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz there's no other reason to wear giant headphones.

794
00:50:27,082 --> 00:50:34,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Always like you see those people who have like super giant amazing like $400 studio monitor.

795
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:34,888
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't sit there.

796
00:50:34,988 --> 00:50:37,878
Speaker 1: iPhone Yeah with a little adapter and this time.

797
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:41,510
Speaker 1: Okay, let's take it out of the bottom of the iPhone listen to an mp3 or whatever.

798
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,333
Speaker 0: Like like.

799
00:50:44,393 --> 00:50:46,421
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's so portable dude that must be so great.

800
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:47,705
Speaker 0: just carry around with you all day.

801
00:50:47,726 --> 00:50:51,149
Speaker 1: your headphones are like Six times bigger than your phone.

802
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:55,270
Speaker 0: Might as well get the giant iPhone if you had the giant headphone.

803
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,825
Speaker 1: but seriously like if you're a kid who's never run into this stuff.

804
00:50:59,408 --> 00:51:08,132
Speaker 1: like You can use serial ports and headphone jacks and TRS stuff to do a lot of stuff without writing any Software.

805
00:51:08,313 --> 00:51:13,529
Speaker 1: like there's cool stuff down at the bottom of computing that no one knows about anymore except old people.

806
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:22,580
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

807
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,327
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening.

808
00:51:24,367 --> 00:51:27,400
Speaker 1: music can't leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

809
00:51:27,701 --> 00:51:32,720
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew comm for show notes discussion news and more.

810
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,020
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

813
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:49,935
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows.

814
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:51,380
Speaker 0: It's actually recorded at night.

815
00:52:11,312 --> 00:52:52,870
Speaker 1: The patrons tonight for this episode in order of the amount of money you're giving us are Nicholas Brando Rebecca Dunn James David White Christian Koontz Jess mechanical mind Renee from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan Perrin drew Oppenlander rare Lavelle Brian Cedroni Rochelle, Montanona Finn Eric Silveraude rim eats poop Edgar Mendez William Eisen rose Aaron Sarris Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame dark fire Samuel Cordray Daniel Redman Chris a dad Doug Snyder Sean Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

816
00:52:53,805 --> 00:52:57,330
Speaker 1: so Yeah, we had some trouble trying to figure out what to do the show on today.

817
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:02,364
Speaker 1: Scott did not want to talk about anything and he doesn't care about tech news.

818
00:53:02,665 --> 00:53:04,269
Speaker 1: He refused to even pick newses.

819
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:15,247
Speaker 1: So I just picked four of the like 20 things I thought were worth talking about into the news and Then I convinced him to do the show on TRS and headphone jacks.

820
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:18,928
Speaker 1: Somehow he agreed to it, but he was like as your ideas stupid.

821
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:24,230
Speaker 1: We had like two minutes to talk about and yeah analyze the wave like I dumped it out.

822
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,658
Speaker 1: We talked about 50% of the time each.

823
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:28,926
Speaker 1: In fact Scott talked a little bit more than me in this episode.

824
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:41,210
Speaker 1: So Yeah, Scott says we can't do shows on things because there's nothing to say and if I trick him into doing it Then we do a show that would push an hour unless I actually cut him off.

825
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,737
Speaker 1: So, I don't know what we'll do.

826
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:45,282
Speaker 1: We're thinking about changing up the format.

827
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:46,505
Speaker 1: maybe for Mondays.

828
00:53:47,307 --> 00:54:01,050
Speaker 1: We might start doing four to five news's and then a shorter main bit or Maybe we'll just do four news's and then whatever our longest news was going to be We'll talk about whatever generic topic can come out of that.

829
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:03,910
Speaker 1: If it means shorter shows fine.

830
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:10,650
Speaker 1: I actually think it'll be fine because Scott did fine and the show ended up in my opinion reasonably good.

831
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:20,550
Speaker 1: if any of you have complaints I tried to cut Scott off about the Minor details of exactly how TRS works in audio between balanced and unbalanced and which is what?

832
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:29,370
Speaker 1: no one actually needs to know that unless you're writing the spec modern equipment is not going to hurt you, but Generally don't plug headphones into microphone jacks.

833
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:35,249
Speaker 1: You might ruin the headphones because of the bias voltage or phantom power or whatever nonsense might be hidden in there.

834
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:40,044
Speaker 1: anyway I'm starting pre-production still on.

835
00:54:40,064 --> 00:54:41,010
Speaker 1: he knows present sutana.

836
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,977
Speaker 1: I'll post some updates about that in the patreon soon.

837
00:54:43,479 --> 00:55:49,790
Speaker 1: Scott still as far as I can tell does not listen to this nonsense and I now leave you your moment of literally the opposite of Zen - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
