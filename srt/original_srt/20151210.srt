1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,452
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, December 10th, 2015.

2
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:13,973
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,600
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:19,517
Speaker 0: jobs Every single one of them.

5
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:34,990
Speaker 0: Let's do this Basically two movies we're gonna see in theaters in the near future because usually it kind of either pirate stuff or wait for it to Come home, or I watch movies on planes a lot.

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,890
Speaker 0: I mean the last movie I saw in a theater that I was like Deeply invested in seeing in the theater was Fury Road.

7
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:43,766
Speaker 1: It usually it takes a real lot to get me to go to a movie theater.

8
00:00:43,786 --> 00:00:48,410
Speaker 0: saw the Martian in the theater And I'm glad I did but seeing it at home would have been pretty much as good.

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,230
Speaker 0: I just wanted to see it, but Fury Road was definitely worth seeing in the theater.

10
00:00:53,551 --> 00:01:04,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, so and if when it comes back to theaters for when you know as like the marathon before Fury Road 2 comes out in a few years I'll go see it in the theater again So I can go see.

11
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,666
Speaker 1: there's gonna be Star Wars which is pretty much what it takes.

12
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:07,530
Speaker 1: you get to me to go to.

13
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:08,855
Speaker 0: You know what?

14
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,365
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna see Star Wars an opening night.

15
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:12,510
Speaker 1: No, how would I do that?

16
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,044
Speaker 0: I saw I went saw a fucking Phantom Menace opening night.

17
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:17,429
Speaker 1: You know what I didn't do that either.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,854
Speaker 1: It's not like.

19
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:26,350
Speaker 0: the day or two after might have been worth it if Phantom Menace hadn't been terrible Still cautiously optimistic about Star Wars.

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,590
Speaker 0: But I'm gonna see it when I can just buy a ticket at the theater that has assigned seating like 84th Street.

21
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:33,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be.

22
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:34,343
Speaker 1: you can be able to see.

23
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:37,421
Speaker 1: it's not going anywhere Right, it's like it's gonna be in that theater for a while.

24
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:42,209
Speaker 1: You can just go see it If it's good, and you know what if it's bad you can maybe avoid it.

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you know what if the like if the initial I don't I mean like.

26
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,290
Speaker 1: I have hopes in meaning.

27
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,773
Speaker 1: I want it to be good, but I don't have any expectations.

28
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:58,078
Speaker 0: my expectation is Probably below average if people I trust see the Star Wars movie and say it's bad.

29
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,500
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go see it in the theater.

30
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,967
Speaker 1: Uh You know it depends on people.

31
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,215
Speaker 0: I trust Scott like it's certain of our friends.

32
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,400
Speaker 1: I don't trust hardly anybody.

33
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:06,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, what it?

34
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:07,525
Speaker 0: what if?

35
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:08,107
Speaker 1: oh wait?

36
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,895
Speaker 1: Maybe I can trust my one snooty co-worker.

37
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:10,477
Speaker 1: I can trust him.

38
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:12,664
Speaker 0: No Would you trust me?

39
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,151
Speaker 0: What if I was like it was a garbage movie?

40
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:14,432
Speaker 1: Well?

41
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:15,999
Speaker 1: I mean you know I don't know.

42
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:24,000
Speaker 0: But the other movie that we got to get tickets to is the 70 millimeter three hour long.

43
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,848
Speaker 1: Hateful eight right so normally.

44
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,240
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go see a Quentin Tarantino movie in the theater.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,550
Speaker 1: I didn't see Inglorious Basterds in the theater.

46
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,032
Speaker 0: well remember.

47
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:31,915
Speaker 0: I saw Django.

48
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaker 1: I didn't see Django in the theater.

49
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,820
Speaker 0: I saw Django in the theater, but I saw it in the shitty Jewish theater in the bad part of Queens.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,259
Speaker 0: So that's worse than your home, but no so because that theater is so shitty.

51
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:48,560
Speaker 0: I Thought the movie was kind of out of focus and had this bad film grain on purpose.

52
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:57,951
Speaker 0: And I did not know that was not true until I saw a YouTube clip of the movie, and I was like oh That was just authentic that wasn't?

53
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,021
Speaker 0: that wasn't on purpose movie I see.

54
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:06,129
Speaker 1: the only movie I saw in that theater the tiny theater and queen in Flushing Main Street is James Bond.

55
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,815
Speaker 1: the world is not enough My grandma when it was near this.

56
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:15,899
Speaker 0: the only other movie I saw at that theater was the Avatar movie the bad one not that not the blue people one.

57
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,659
Speaker 1: Okay, the only reason I didn't walk out the blue people one is man.

58
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:23,439
Speaker 0: I liked it was a good movie solid sci-fi ish movie.

59
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,667
Speaker 0: Yeah But no that that avatar movie.

60
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:31,272
Speaker 0: the only reason I didn't walk out is that I had no way to get home So I needed a ride so I'd wait for the movie to end.

61
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:37,615
Speaker 1: I found out that one of my Newer co-workers is like a super fan of the blue people avatar like.

62
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:38,398
Speaker 1: he's like man.

63
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,265
Speaker 1: when that was out I thought it was the coolest thing.

64
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,309
Speaker 1: I was buying stuff.

65
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,378
Speaker 1: It was my wallpaper on my desktop.

66
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,729
Speaker 0: Wow well You know I was kind of like.

67
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,920
Speaker 1: I didn't realize anyone was that into that movie.

68
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,823
Speaker 1: But I guess someone is.

69
00:03:49,084 --> 00:03:51,312
Speaker 0: it's weird to see someone who's very into like.

70
00:03:51,994 --> 00:04:01,120
Speaker 0: one movie like Mad Max is different Yeah, but like series of movie I guess there's a kind of person who like changes their desktop background ever like every time the newest.

71
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:06,479
Speaker 1: I mean go see what you know this trailers for right now right pick one of those things this someone who's like.

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 1: I'm like a fan of whatever it is, but Eight I have to see in the theater because it's in 70 millimeter.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,746
Speaker 1: Otherwise I'd wait for it to.

74
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:14,330
Speaker 1: you know it's like.

75
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,099
Speaker 1: I fucking love Quentin Tarantino movies But I don't think I've ever seen any of them in the theater.

76
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,500
Speaker 0: I think I saw Pulp Fiction in the theater, but I don't know if I might have seen Kill Bill in the theater.

77
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,389
Speaker 0: I saw both Kill Bill movies in the theater.

78
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:28,320
Speaker 1: I might have seen them both, but other than that It's like dude.

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,983
Speaker 1: I you know.

80
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:37,461
Speaker 1: they're just fine to watch at home even though Quentin Tarantino is like the biggest freakin You know like vinyl listening film using you know snob hipster Yeah,

81
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,169
Speaker 0: but it's a bad format,

82
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:40,515
Speaker 1: but the thing is if it's a 70 millimeter

83
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,227
Speaker 0: Not

84
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:46,279
Speaker 1: like this 70 millimeter, it's not like vinyl records where it's like.

85
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,624
Speaker 1: oh I like that sort of thing.

86
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,753
Speaker 1: right it is just better.

87
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:53,345
Speaker 1: the film is so big Right and the it is.

88
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,195
Speaker 1: so we aspect ratio is so wide.

89
00:04:56,516 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 1: if you watch that at home It's gonna be like this little sliver down the middle of your TV with like these two.

90
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what the aspect racing ratio is.

91
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,020
Speaker 1: it's like one to three or so two point seven six to one.

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:22,280
Speaker 1: So it's basically one to three yeah, which means you see my guy in order to watch this at home your teeth Imagine you have to have three TVs in a row And it would span it would take full height and it would go all across all three TV.

93
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,020
Speaker 1: So if you put it on just one TV the top third and the bottom third of the TV screen are gonna be black.

94
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna have remember letterboxing.

95
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,160
Speaker 0: well letterboxing in your yo dog.

96
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:39,383
Speaker 1: This is why you have to see and you know I think he's gonna release a version that is like digital And isn't.

97
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,154
Speaker 1: but why would you go see that?

98
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:41,919
Speaker 0: yeah?

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,980
Speaker 1: Yeah guys, there's not that many showing this To do what I always wanted, which is you know so many Hollywood movies.

100
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,838
Speaker 1: It's like they all make them all 90 minutes because you know people have short attention spans especially adults.

101
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:59,117
Speaker 1: these days It's fucking three hours motherfucker.

102
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:02,869
Speaker 0: It's like There is an inner inner mission.

103
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:03,571
Speaker 0: Thank God.

104
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,533
Speaker 1: It's like dude.

105
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:05,837
Speaker 1: You know it's like you.

106
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:06,920
Speaker 1: look at all the great movies.

107
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:10,755
Speaker 1: It's like most of them are fucking long even the old Star Wars movies like two hours.

108
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,453
Speaker 1: right if I'm not mistaken Lawrence of Arabia like that's a fucking movie.

109
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:14,996
Speaker 1: right.

110
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:15,619
Speaker 1: bring it on.

111
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,837
Speaker 1: I don't want to go to the movie theater and pay a fortune to sit there for 90 fucking minutes.

112
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,307
Speaker 1: if I'm going there I want to sit there all.

113
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:25,495
Speaker 0: goddamn day there might be an upper limit But I think that upper limit for me is got her damn wrong.

114
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:30,060
Speaker 1: I mean yeah, okay There is definitely an upper limit, which is where if I have to leave to you know P or whatever.

115
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:32,050
Speaker 1: But if you have two inner missions, I'm still good.

116
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,840
Speaker 1: if you need a third then we have a problem.

117
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,727
Speaker 0: I just realized I can't.

118
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:37,453
Speaker 1: I think Lawrence of Arabia has two inner missions.

119
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:43,060
Speaker 0: the thing is this movie because Tarantino is a fanboy of this stuff is going to use this.

120
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:46,920
Speaker 1: The trailer already tells you it's gonna be just as good as his previous movies.

121
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:51,799
Speaker 1: It had a little bit as you have to see this one in the theater because the trailer had a little bit of TV.

122
00:06:51,819 --> 00:07:06,630
Speaker 0: is Tiny that derp act like the certain kind of certain kind of acting that you'd see in like 90s westerns And I feel like it's going for that instead of for like older western style Just the way the actors talk to each other and the way they.

123
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:07,453
Speaker 0: well.

124
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,140
Speaker 0: We'll review the movie after it comes out.

125
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,521
Speaker 1: I don't care.

126
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,188
Speaker 1: I can read the cinematography well.

127
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:21,463
Speaker 0: Yeah, because he's such a fanboy this movie You know is going to use every millimeter of that wide format to do Everything.

128
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:24,532
Speaker 1: so imagine is three hours long and the film is gigantic right.

129
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:32,015
Speaker 1: I heard that at the places that are actually you know Projecting the film they had to have like teams of people like carry it up the stairs because it weighs.

130
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:35,063
Speaker 0: they deployed special Cameras.

131
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,400
Speaker 1: well the projectors don't exist in a lot of places.

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,931
Speaker 1: So they had to like get old projector parts from everywhere They could and like mangled projectors together, and you know if they're gonna go through the effort I'll go through the effort of watching it.

133
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:48,286
Speaker 0: so if you don't live in a big city You just can't like.

134
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,660
Speaker 0: it's not playing in that many places in that format.

135
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:51,666
Speaker 1: Get in your car.

136
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,759
Speaker 1: if you don't live in a big city you have a car and you can get to one.

137
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,897
Speaker 0: There's like three or four places doing it in New York, so we're good.

138
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:57,340
Speaker 0: We're good.

139
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:06,211
Speaker 0: So in the news remember how yeah the last show we talked about how we saw two different people in cars Almost get hit by trains because people can't drive.

140
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:10,829
Speaker 0: yeah got another train story Boston train on the t-line like.

141
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,059
Speaker 0: it's just a little like local commuter train.

142
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, well so passengers are on this train like this happened this morning.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,094
Speaker 1: So I mean the T is not as a subway But some of it is more commuter rally depending on the line you're on this.

144
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:29,034
Speaker 1: this was this was a. some of the tees are Actually like buses that are underground, but this one's actually a train train.

145
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like a big subway.

146
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:36,066
Speaker 0: Okay, so people got on the train, and it takes off Skips its first stop.

147
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,179
Speaker 1: is it going like no normal speed normal speed just.

148
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,258
Speaker 0: Then it skips its second stop.

149
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,722
Speaker 1: well I mean, that's a problem.

150
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:49,120
Speaker 1: so people in the I mean if it skips what the regular subway skips one stop unannounced.

151
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:54,889
Speaker 1: That's never happened to me and all the years that happened to me once I would push as soon as if that ever happened.

152
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,360
Speaker 1: I would push the emergency talk to the engineer button immediately.

153
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:04,191
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the only reason I didn't the one time it happened is because the whole crowd starts going rabble rabble rabble like immediately.

154
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,818
Speaker 0: I push the button right away, and then an announcement comes on.

155
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:12,327
Speaker 0: just like ladies and gentlemen due to Bubble bubble we're making stops.

156
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:17,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but that's that happens, but if they don't say anything it just skips a stop unannounced.

157
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:18,540
Speaker 1: I'm pushing that red button immediately.

158
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:20,566
Speaker 0: People who were in the car.

159
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,520
Speaker 0: that is where the purse the engineer running the train is on car.

160
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I assume it's the front car.

161
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,853
Speaker 1: I hope so.

162
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:26,818
Speaker 1: otherwise how could they see?

163
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:32,611
Speaker 0: They go and start like banging on the door to see what's up And then they realize there is no one in there.

164
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:34,260
Speaker 1: there the emergency stop.

165
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,905
Speaker 1: So if what?

166
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:41,768
Speaker 0: the thing that everyone pulls for the wrong reason all the time like I got heartburn wait Are you telling me?

167
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:42,433
Speaker 1: Are you telling me?

168
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,259
Speaker 1: They didn't pull it?

169
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,262
Speaker 0: No one pulled it.

170
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,868
Speaker 0: the central office happened.

171
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:53,439
Speaker 0: the central office cut power to the track and Stopped the train and then the train was stopped with no power.

172
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:56,659
Speaker 0: So the people on the train started trying to break windows to get out of it.

173
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,920
Speaker 1: No, aren't they emergency opening windows?

174
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:08,802
Speaker 1: I just think the moral of the story instructions to how to open the door in an emergency think people in Boston Just might not be that bright Cuz.

175
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:14,495
Speaker 0: if I were on this train one I would have pulled the emergency break as far as I know.

176
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:18,694
Speaker 1: if I know there's no engineer I pulled the emergency brake and then I'd be like all right.

177
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,537
Speaker 1: everyone in this car.

178
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,020
Speaker 1: listen up.

179
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,700
Speaker 1: Here's the instructions for getting the hell out of here, but I'm in New York.

180
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,340
Speaker 0: I wouldn't need to because everyone in New York would react the exact same way.

181
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:31,240
Speaker 0: We'd be fucking prying the door open with a little crank and we find me in the subway.

182
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,323
Speaker 1: There's emergency exits that let you get back up to the street and they're well lit and then you can find where they are Pretty easily.

183
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially if the electricity is off.

184
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:42,340
Speaker 0: if I got trapped on a train I would risk it in the tunnels like I would not dude.

185
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:42,884
Speaker 1: I'm like you.

186
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:47,700
Speaker 1: when you're just in the train you can look out the window and say oh look There's a staircase that takes you up to 50 whatever Street.

187
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,820
Speaker 1: Oh know that if I ever had to escape this train don't touch the third rail.

188
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:59,340
Speaker 1: My biggest fear is that if you're in which is completely unrealistic is if you're in a tunnel and the tunnel just cracks open and All the river pours in nothing you knew about that.

189
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,791
Speaker 1: No, but I mean that would be fucking scary as hell.

190
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:02,394
Speaker 1: way to die.

191
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:03,520
Speaker 1: who wouldn't want to go that way?

192
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess.

193
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:06,331
Speaker 0: well, you'd probably just drown.

194
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:07,496
Speaker 1: Yes, you would drown.

195
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:08,360
Speaker 1: it would suck balls.

196
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,608
Speaker 0: I'd rather drown than I don't know fire.

197
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,273
Speaker 0: I think fire is worse than drowning.

198
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:14,080
Speaker 1: I might try to kill myself before I drown.

199
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,225
Speaker 0: How by drowning.

200
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:17,872
Speaker 1: it's like smashing my head against the tree.

201
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,779
Speaker 0: I don't think that would kill you before drowning.

202
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:20,782
Speaker 0: did I?

203
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,198
Speaker 1: Bad news?

204
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:24,085
Speaker 1: Hope.

205
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,595
Speaker 1: maybe they'd be like rocks caving in.

206
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:26,219
Speaker 1: I can get crushed.

207
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:33,366
Speaker 0: plus What if you get lucky and the water rushing in flushes the train car forward and that pocket of air holds out long enough For someone to come rescue you?

208
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:35,072
Speaker 1: that would be so unlikely.

209
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:36,458
Speaker 0: It's possible got a holdout.

210
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:38,738
Speaker 0: Hope I Mean, what do you got to lose?

211
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:41,887
Speaker 1: I guess I would be so.

212
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:47,354
Speaker 0: yeah, there's debates of if this was Sabotage or if the operator might have.

213
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,440
Speaker 1: could it be sabotaged?

214
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,219
Speaker 0: So someone tampered with the dead man switch that's supposed to top that just stop the train if there's no one driving it.

215
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:59,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, how did the trains drive because someone tampered with the thing that's supposed to stop the train if no one's driving it?

216
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,671
Speaker 0: They said it was tampered with.

217
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:02,738
Speaker 0: it was not an error.

218
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:05,186
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so who done it?

219
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:10,180
Speaker 0: the operator who's supposed to be driving it is apparently out administrative leave and there's an investigation.

220
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,355
Speaker 0: All right, my guess people are saying oh maybe terror or whatever.

221
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:25,334
Speaker 0: now my guess is dude jury-rigged it so we didn't have to hold it the whole time while he drove it normally and Accidentally like let it go when he wasn't there the train just left.

222
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:28,705
Speaker 0: that's gonna make you don't like the people who you know The thing on a lawnmower.

223
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,371
Speaker 0: if you let go of it the blade stops.

224
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know everyone just wraps twine around that.

225
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,888
Speaker 0: So it's always up.

226
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:35,933
Speaker 1: No, we did not do that.

227
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:37,619
Speaker 0: I did not either Scott, but you know what?

228
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:43,700
Speaker 0: And most people Disable that as the first thing they do when they get a lawnmower.

229
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:48,964
Speaker 0: Go to go to the Midwest pick any random garage You can walk right in.

230
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:51,800
Speaker 0: everyone leaves their garage doors open and look at their lawnmower.

231
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,340
Speaker 0: I practically guarantee they have jury rig something to prevent that safety mechanism from working.

232
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,406
Speaker 1: Well, if you do that, you should go to a place that begins with a J or P Jeep.

233
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:09,724
Speaker 1: no a J or a P jail or to prison Or The P pokey.

234
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:15,077
Speaker 0: so an actual news L. I got an actual news - Scott had nothing I guess.

235
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:19,278
Speaker 0: or the D dungeon Don't John?

236
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,733
Speaker 0: About how about the lubliette?

237
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,505
Speaker 0: That's Oh Or L.

238
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:25,509
Speaker 1: Well, that that's it.

239
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,556
Speaker 1: That'd be like saying T the jail.

240
00:13:27,576 --> 00:13:28,058
Speaker 1: Yeah.

241
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:37,740
Speaker 0: So In other news cuz Scott decided that there is no news worth talking about I couldn't hire world.

242
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:47,071
Speaker 0: So the other thing I got is a lot of people seem to be really invested in these quote-unquote hoverboards And I don't know why this is such a thing.

243
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:47,392
Speaker 0: one.

244
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,600
Speaker 0: These things are like two to six hundred dollars.

245
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:51,193
Speaker 1: It's just like the new scooter.

246
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,762
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned I don't give a fuck.

247
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:58,985
Speaker 0: their cheap shitty pieces of plastic that putter along at about like four to six miles an hour Faster than walking.

248
00:13:59,326 --> 00:13:59,990
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

249
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:00,994
Speaker 1: I saw a guy.

250
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:04,840
Speaker 1: I mean I cried the One at full speed down the street.

251
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,967
Speaker 1: I could have gone faster than him But only if I really so.

252
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,099
Speaker 0: most of these things go four to six miles an hour.

253
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:19,712
Speaker 0: My default walking pace as I confirmed one day on a treadmill by walking just at my normal speed and trying to see My default walking pace is five point one miles an hour.

254
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,438
Speaker 0: These things go four to six.

255
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:24,447
Speaker 1: So He was booking it.

256
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:32,051
Speaker 0: the I'm saying most expensive of these can go up to 15 miles an hour Which is about like that's close to.

257
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,677
Speaker 1: my buddy might have had that one because he was.

258
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:34,320
Speaker 1: he was booking it.

259
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would not move that in the street.

260
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,893
Speaker 1: Not even the side.

261
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:39,880
Speaker 0: I would not move that fast on a platform.

262
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,186
Speaker 0: I'm standing on that.

263
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,653
Speaker 0: I have very little control over dude.

264
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:44,220
Speaker 1: I can't even stand on a skateboard.

265
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,985
Speaker 1: So I'm definitely not standing one of these.

266
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:58,940
Speaker 0: but the interesting thing is that these things like to just explode and catch fire and seriously Injure people because these aren't being manufactured by like, you know, someone who's like a high quality manufacturer of transportation equipment.

267
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,273
Speaker 1: It's not like a bombardier.

268
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:06,040
Speaker 1: Yeah It is a cheap Chinese knockoff, you know, it's what hoverboard.

269
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not Otis in order to have enough power to make something move, you know Like with a human being standing on it.

270
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:16,626
Speaker 1: It can't be like weak in the battery department like a you know A knockoff third-party camera battery.

271
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,915
Speaker 1: It's got to be like a serious fucking battery.

272
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,300
Speaker 1: Like the thing is mostly battery.

273
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, these things have batteries like those electric bikes have.

274
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:25,840
Speaker 1: so you have a cheapo battery and a cheapo electric motor.

275
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,515
Speaker 1: That is a recipe for the boom-boom.

276
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:35,774
Speaker 0: so Yeah, these things just keep Exploding and seriously hurting people and cuz they're not being manufactured.

277
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:37,880
Speaker 1: What high quality person is manufacturing.

278
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:45,064
Speaker 0: So that's the interesting thing because I was poking around a little bit because a lot of people said oh don't buy a knockoff one Buy the real one.

279
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:45,827
Speaker 1: What's the real one?

280
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,172
Speaker 1: There is no real one.

281
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:49,120
Speaker 0: They're all basically the same.

282
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,739
Speaker 0: There's like four or five Chinese manufacturers who are making these things white and people are buying them white label and just selling them.

283
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,867
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's zero quality control.

284
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:01,380
Speaker 1: No, like, you know, at least with like say previous transportation devices.

285
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,264
Speaker 1: It's like there's.

286
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:10,375
Speaker 1: there's some brand that's like the real brand like, you know, there's the GoPro camera Yeah, there's the razor scooter and then there's the pro pro and the bazer right?

287
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,178
Speaker 1: There's the segue.

288
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,249
Speaker 0: segue Yeah, then there's the Sorni the magnet box, right?

289
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:14,610
Speaker 1: It's like.

290
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:20,674
Speaker 1: but for these there isn't a real brand Originated as a cheap knockoff and there's only knockoffs.

291
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,760
Speaker 1: There's no real one.

292
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:27,240
Speaker 0: They seem to have been embraced weirdly by the hip-hop community.

293
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:33,220
Speaker 1: Alright, I thought it was in the same community of like using razor scooters like little teenagers and kids in the neighborhood.

294
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:41,059
Speaker 0: I always I was doing a lot of research over lunch just cuz I was you know kind of cuz I found a Twitter feed that was just vines and videos of these things exploding.

295
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:52,436
Speaker 0: but Basically as far as I can tell these are most popular among like Boring upper middle like the children of boring upper middle-class suburban people the razor scooter.

296
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:55,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay and Hip-hop enthusiasts.

297
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:58,457
Speaker 0: All right, like bunch of rappers are using for stuff.

298
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,340
Speaker 1: That's totally cool.

299
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,519
Speaker 1: You can rap while you're on this.

300
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,885
Speaker 1: It's hard to rap on a bicycle.

301
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:05,460
Speaker 0: you're huffing and puffing and you know and I can see that and I feel that style.

302
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:06,365
Speaker 1: But you can.

303
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,415
Speaker 1: you can zip on a stage of this thing and back.

304
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:12,250
Speaker 0: Oh Be awesome, but why do we call them hover boards?

305
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,012
Speaker 0: They're not boards.

306
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:13,694
Speaker 0: They do not hover.

307
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:15,260
Speaker 1: someone called it that.

308
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,813
Speaker 1: I think I originally see what they are.

309
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,944
Speaker 0: They're Handless segues.

310
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:23,859
Speaker 1: I mean it the first time I saw one they actually called it by some other name dirt boards.

311
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,005
Speaker 1: No, it's like.

312
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,639
Speaker 1: I guess it might be the original name of it was like the something tech something I don't know.

313
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,161
Speaker 0: Well, there's a few things like this is mono wheel thing Like?

314
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:36,408
Speaker 0: this kind of thing has been around for a while and someone just decided to manufacture a bunch of super dangerous ones to start Selling them.

315
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,619
Speaker 0: All right Yeah They're also technically illegal in New York.

316
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,004
Speaker 0: I mean any kind of like.

317
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:57,858
Speaker 1: the same is anything anything that is a powered transportation device That is not registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles like a car or a motorcycle or a truck is Illegal in New York, but some have a motor device that isn't registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles.

318
00:17:57,898 --> 00:18:04,560
Speaker 0: now simultaneously There are some exceptions for very specific classes of devices, but that excludes most things.

319
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,240
Speaker 1: Exceptions are things like a power wheels for your kid as long as he stays in the driveway and the sidewalk.

320
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,680
Speaker 0: I believe there's an exception for power assist bicycles as well, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

321
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,000
Speaker 1: I never heard of that one.

322
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:23,060
Speaker 1: I found Conflicting reports of whether or not there's far as I know a powered by anything less than a moped can't be ready.

323
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,799
Speaker 0: Oh, so there are rules around that.

324
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:37,460
Speaker 0: Now where where bikes that have power assists are Okay, but bikes that just drive without any pedaling or not, okay I can't quite figure that out.

325
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,732
Speaker 1: I mean just go to the DMV and get a little license.

326
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,140
Speaker 1: the same one they can say it's a moped.

327
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,068
Speaker 1: Just say that even if it's not and you'll be probably.

328
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,033
Speaker 0: but that's the thing in New York City.

329
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:56,453
Speaker 0: specifically if something Cannot is something is regulated and there's a thing that's like that thing But is not like that thing enough to be licensed the same way?

330
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,460
Speaker 0: the answer isn't oh, it's okay.

331
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,960
Speaker 0: Then the answer is it's illegal.

332
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:04,140
Speaker 0: That's why airsoft guns are as illegal as real guns.

333
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:13,040
Speaker 1: The thing that really bothers me is that people who want to use some weirdo transportation device on the road There's already a legal option and that is the three-wheeled motor vehicle.

334
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:21,665
Speaker 1: Yeah As far as I know from everything I've seen in my life the truck in New York City and New York State if you have A three-wheeled vehicle.

335
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:26,700
Speaker 1: There's pretty much almost no regulation and you can go to the DMV and get a license plate for it.

336
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:34,720
Speaker 1: And like I've seen such a wide variety of three-wheeled vehicles It seems like there's basically almost no regulation on what it takes for that to be street-legal.

337
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,849
Speaker 1: I've seen them without lights.

338
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:37,100
Speaker 1: They have a license plate.

339
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:45,166
Speaker 1: I've seen them like with the one wheel in the front the one wheel in the back all kind of wide real fucking wide like wider than one lane wide.

340
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:48,800
Speaker 1: four wheels in the back two on each side with one big one in the front.

341
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:55,177
Speaker 1: I've seen ridiculous shit and all of them have license plates and I've seen cops near a few of these.

342
00:19:55,438 --> 00:20:01,160
Speaker 1: not even give a shit Because apparently the law is such that if it's got three wheels you could do almost whatever the fuck you want.

343
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,553
Speaker 1: So people put a third wheel on this fucking hoverboard.

344
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:05,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we are good to go.

345
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:12,560
Speaker 0: But I feel like this tech needs a little more iteration before it would be cooler for me to you.

346
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,060
Speaker 1: I don't understand why there some company that's actually capable of manufacturing quality goods doesn't get in on this.

347
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think part of the segue is too big.

348
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,581
Speaker 0: this like segues are dumb even in conventions Like.

349
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,033
Speaker 0: they just get in the way, but these would be great.

350
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,419
Speaker 0: It's like an enforcer at PAX.

351
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,396
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of the rule Is because if you made a good one like say be like a thousand dollars.

352
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,888
Speaker 1: Let's say bombardier made one Yeah, or like who else could make one?

353
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:38,153
Speaker 1: Suzuki could probably make one.

354
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:41,816
Speaker 1: right people have the you know, the capacity Yeah thousand two thousand dollars.

355
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:51,420
Speaker 1: that yeah It would cost so much money for the good one that everyone only the richest like, you know People would buy one and everyone in knowing normal people would buy what even couldn't sell enough.

356
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,489
Speaker 0: They're selling these for four to six hundred bucks and that is not what they cost to make Especially cuz they clearly like.

357
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:08,420
Speaker 1: I imagine you at the battery pack probably is Remember my my tablet video from before I imagined is just dogs breakfast I imagine is just a bunch of cheap lithium ion batteries all you know in a pack, right?

358
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,594
Speaker 1: It's anything fancy tape together solder together.

359
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:21,317
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway anyway things of the day Got a thing of the day.

360
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,050
Speaker 1: I did remember one at the last second.

361
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,210
Speaker 1: I already posted this in the forum, but if you're listening to the show you're probably not into the forum.

362
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:34,799
Speaker 1: So yeah, you also probably don't go to packs apparently, but I digress anyway, so Way back in the 90s 1999 or 98 but actually no 99.

363
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,210
Speaker 1: All right that phantom mean ass came out cuz it you know Star Wars time.

364
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:38,914
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Star Wars.

365
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Phantom Menace came out and you know, it was a big deal.

366
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:56,169
Speaker 1: And at the time, you know There was people lining up outside movie theaters to get tickets or to see it including me and him and every other nerd who was alive then and conscious then and The news went to report on these long lines.

367
00:21:56,654 --> 00:22:02,510
Speaker 1: so somebody went and took News reports from those days and cut them up and made this little video here for you to watch.

368
00:22:03,293 --> 00:22:07,790
Speaker 1: And it shows Star Wars fans before going in being like oh, it's gonna be so good guys.

369
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:08,532
Speaker 1: Oh good.

370
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:11,583
Speaker 1: Oh, and then it shows what they said when they came out.

371
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:16,097
Speaker 1: Oh and when they came out You'd be surprised pretty much all.

372
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,883
Speaker 1: every single person was like, oh my god.

373
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,726
Speaker 1: It was life-changing.

374
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:19,650
Speaker 1: I'm gonna see it again.

375
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,059
Speaker 0: Cuz I remember walking out of that movie.

376
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,405
Speaker 0: it was me and a bunch of our friends.

377
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,330
Speaker 0: we walk out.

378
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:25,876
Speaker 0: No one was saying anything.

379
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,683
Speaker 1: We were just at the end of this video.

380
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:31,576
Speaker 1: There's one guy where They're like, how did you like it?

381

Speaker 1: everyone had everyone else in the video.

383
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:45,210
Speaker 1: Yeah This has resulted in people who like Phantom Menace saying look it's actually good all you people who don't like it are on the bandwagon.

384
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:51,809
Speaker 1: You Would have liked it if it wasn't the situation where everyone else, you know didn't like it.

385
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,197
Speaker 0: Yeah I can at least say cuz I.

386
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,988
Speaker 1: and then the response to that is jar jar bangs.

387
00:22:57,028 --> 00:23:00,783
Speaker 0: I rest my case Because we were and we sat there silently.

388
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:01,667
Speaker 0: the credits roll.

389
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:02,370

Speaker 0: So yeah, that video is great.

397
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,790
Speaker 0: But I just remember Craig turned to us like everyone's in quiet.

398
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:17,526
Speaker 0: He was like guys.

399
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,616

400
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:25,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we're all like nah, but what if Craig turned to you and said, oh man That was amazing.

00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:29,508
Speaker 0: Would you guys been like, yeah, I would have been like, who are you?

402
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,288
Speaker 0: How did you?

403
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:43,389
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, but they there's actually some articles going around lately which reminded me of something I knew and forgot which is that The current culture of movie trailers was started by the Phantom Menace.

404
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:44,673
Speaker 1: You know what?

405
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:53,357
Speaker 1: when the Phantom Menace had a movie trailer and you could only see it before a few different shitty movies like Waterboy and such and so I Pirated it from the internet cuz I knew the fuck.

406
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:58,954
Speaker 1: I was like that trailer on the internet and the day after Lucasfilm put It on the internet and it was hard to get it But I knew what I was doing.

407
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:03,413
Speaker 1: so I had it and that was like the first time anyone had ever watched a movie trailer Anything internet.

408
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:07,490
Speaker 1: we downloaded this like, you know, it wasn't even an mp4 is an mpg file.

409
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just an mpeg2 file, you know what that trailer?

410
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,470
Speaker 1: it took a long time to download with our shitty 56k modems.

411
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:14,699
Speaker 1: We watched it.

412
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,170
Speaker 1: It was a big friggin deal I can you know, you had to have a good computer to be able to play the video file, you know.

413
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,399
Speaker 1: And that was like a huge deal.

414
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:39,489
Speaker 1: and ever and then ever since then You know that was when like the movie trailer thing Became a thing and you get apple.com slash trailers and I think you know According to some articles like by getting that the movie trailer thing going Apple got like 600,000 QuickTime downloads at once.

415
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:42,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a big deal.

416
00:24:42,596 --> 00:24:46,970
Speaker 1: so, you know nowadays you just watch movie trailers at apple.com trailers like it's nothing.

417
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,458
Speaker 1: But Phantom Menace is the reason that that started.

418
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,765
Speaker 0: so there this is a clip.

419
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,390
Speaker 0: Emily found this and it's wonderful.

420
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,076
Speaker 0: So, you know Margaret Atwood is right.

00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:36,145
Speaker 0: Also Magellan didn't actually make it.

473
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,378
Speaker 0: His crew killed him before they made it.

474
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:39,946

475
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:40,810
Speaker 0: the boat made it.

476
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,374

480
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,879
Speaker 1: Well, Magellan is probably also a jerk.

481
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,730
Speaker 0: I suspect Magellan was a dick.

482
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:52,854
Speaker 1: I don't suspect.

483
00:27:53,095 --> 00:27:57,250

527
00:29:58,553 --> 00:30:01,346
Speaker 1: You can surmise there is something special about the red one.

528
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,254
Speaker 1: one person What could it be say?

529

549
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:50,150

550
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,070

Speaker 0: How many does Suzy have?

591
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,001
Speaker 1: Listen, you don't have a job and you're so desperate.

592
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:48,190
Speaker 1: You're gonna try to work for the census.

593
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:50,225
Speaker 1: You probably don't have a job for reasons.

594
00:32:50,648 --> 00:33:01,249
Speaker 0: So They called me and they're like, yeah we want how you run it the fuck away like before I was ready cuz high school was still going and I was like No, and my parents were like, uh, you should experience what work is like.

595
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,457
Speaker 0: Also, you probably need some money.

596
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:05,706
Speaker 0: So I was like, okay sure.

597
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:06,670
Speaker 0: so I took the job.

598
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,580
Speaker 0: So I went to high school 730 in the morning until 3 left.

599
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:14,050
Speaker 0: high school went to work from 4 to midnight at the census.

600
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,364
Speaker 1: I didn't realize it was that many hours.

601
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:18,390
Speaker 0: It was a full-time job.

602
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,565
Speaker 0: I did it for two weeks and then I said fuck this shit.

603
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:23,207
Speaker 1: I'm out.

604
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:23,990
Speaker 1: I quit.

605
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:32,177
Speaker 0: And then they called me again after I graduated and said, uh You want to come back during the daylight.

606
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:35,006
Speaker 0: and I said yes, and then I worked there until I quit.

607
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,010
Speaker 0: I go to college.

608
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,690
Speaker 1: And basically I guess they were still doing the census when we went to college.

609
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:45,184
Speaker 0: So my job was basically to be an accounting and payroll clerk.

610
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:51,990
Speaker 0: and let me tell you that Job is real hard for a lot of people to do like a lot of my co-workers.

611
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,464
Speaker 1: Well, it's wouldn't you hire an accountant to do that job?

612
00:33:54,847 --> 00:33:58,539
Speaker 0: Uh So the census has to hire an entire.

613
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,030
Speaker 0: so there was someone in charge who would like tell people what to do.

614
00:34:01,432 --> 00:34:07,450
Speaker 0: but the work was done by people who didn't need to know how it actually worked and Basically you were able to figure out how it worked.

615
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:16,614
Speaker 0: I they ended up having keeping only me as the sole clerk for the entire office for the entire time because I could do in About 12 hours a week.

616
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:21,049
Speaker 0: What took a team of people working for 40 hours a week to do previously?

617
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:41,949
Speaker 0: and then I started also doing all their IT and basically everything in the office and It was really weird because it was all 40 to 50 year old like women who had husbands or were widows a few old people and This 18 year old punk kid nerd.

618
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:45,089
Speaker 0: It was a weird experience working there.

619
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,476
Speaker 0: What was your first job?

620
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:48,542
Speaker 1: I worked at.

621
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,469
Speaker 1: was I go to the dry cleaner for it?

622
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,038
Speaker 1: No, I went to the summer camp first.

623
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,188
Speaker 1: or did it summer camp first or dry cleaners first?

624
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,692
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

625
00:34:56,112 --> 00:35:02,836
Speaker 1: and I was a summer camp counselor at two or three different places and then In high school, I worked at a dry cleaner.

626
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:08,240
Speaker 1: after school I'd take the same bus that took me home would also if I just stayed on it go to the dry cleaner.

627
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:09,048
Speaker 1: So I'd get off

628
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,098
Speaker 0: like school bus sir

629
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:26,420
Speaker 1: Yeah school bus and then I'd just go to the dry cleaner and I'd stay there until it closed like at 6 And then I just go home to my house and eat dinner and I do that like two or three days a week and then also like You know sometimes like Saturday like the be open like Saturday morning or something like until noon or whatever.

630
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:32,260
Speaker 1: So I'd go in early on Saturday morning and then leave at noon, you know, then watch football or it's on whatever.

631
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:44,428
Speaker 0: I guess there's always weird having those kinds of jobs like the not a career job For me because the jobs are always like really really easy and yet at the same time They pay almost enough to live.

632
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:47,380
Speaker 1: it paid me enough that I bought a computer with that monies.

633
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:52,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had some bonds my grandma T&T to video card when it was brand new.

634
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:56,879
Speaker 1: I basically just saved all the money and bought a computer because I didn't have to buy food or rent or anything.

635
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,627
Speaker 1: And summer camp was pretty much just like.

636
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,514
Speaker 1: also money I didn't spend.

637
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:04,260
Speaker 1: oh no, I think I used the summer camp money.

638
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:10,979
Speaker 1: I bought a Gameboy color the day it came out and I bought you know And then I bought games for it a whole bunch all the games.

639
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:20,971
Speaker 1: and then In college, I I think I did summer camp again in between freshman sophomore year Between freshman and sophomore year.

640
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,200
Speaker 0: I went back home to Michigan.

641
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:28,644
Speaker 0: I went home like they wouldn't let us live in the dorms over the summer and I worked Construction at a Kmart.

642
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:31,130
Speaker 1: Oh, right that one because they were renovating Kmart's.

643
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:41,155
Speaker 0: they hired construction workers to renovate the inside of this Kmart and That job paid way less than the census and summer camp counselor pays almost nothing.

644
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:44,287
Speaker 1: you get one check at the end of the job and it's like for hunt.

645
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:57,327
Speaker 1: it's like not a lot of money at all and The thing is all the money that you know, you you're not an hourly worker It's like being a waiter or waitress whatever but you what you get in return is basically free summer camp Which cost a fortune right?

646
00:36:57,347 --> 00:37:01,691
Speaker 1: You get all that food all that lodging all that You know all those trips that you go on.

647
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:02,675
Speaker 1: you get to swim in the pool.

648
00:37:02,695 --> 00:37:05,991
Speaker 1: You get to play baseball To do all this shit, right?

649
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:07,660
Speaker 1: So that's why that's a good job.

650
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:11,840
Speaker 1: I lied and I would totally just be summer camp counselor forever if I could live like that.

651
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:14,813
Speaker 0: I actually applied with my brother and we both worked at that place.

652
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:16,763
Speaker 0: like at that came our doing construction that whole summer.

653
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:27,902
Speaker 0: I lied and Basically said I wasn't going to college and I just graduated high school to get the job Because there's no way they would hire me if they knew I was going to college September you would leave.

654
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:34,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that job was probably the worst experience of my life other than food poisoning.

655
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, Lyme disease and food poisoning.

656
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:49,777
Speaker 0: just because like it was soul-crushing to work So hard doing physical labor for 40 to 60 hours a week making 7 bucks an hour.

657
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, but just it.

658
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:58,720
Speaker 1: folding clothes and throwing a bag and the weirdest thing was like putting number two tags on shirts.

659
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:00,116
Speaker 1: The people got the right shirt back.

660
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,444
Speaker 0: people I had to work with.

661
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:05,708
Speaker 0: like there was a break room and I go hang on the break room your 15-minute breaks and your 30 minute break.

662
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:14,860
Speaker 0: and They were like I don't want it like they were just the worst people Like they all smoked everyone smoked so they'd all take smoke breaks all the time.

663
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:27,139
Speaker 0: most of them had graduated from the same high school as me, but Had run up a bunch of credit card debt somehow and had the job to try to pay off all their thousands and thousands of dollars of credit card debt.

664
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:30,240
Speaker 0: For I guess I don't know how they racked up all those credit.

665
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,318
Speaker 1: We need to save money to eat also and they use some of the money to pay the payments on the credit card.

666
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:38,909
Speaker 0: understand And I just like I literally there was.

667
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:46,960
Speaker 0: no I I gave up trying to have conversations with anyone there and I Considered just quitting and not having money.

668
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,631
Speaker 0: That's how soul crushing that experience was like.

669
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:56,259
Speaker 0: I was very willing to not have money Rather than continue to do this work somewhere else.

670
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:59,750
Speaker 0: I was in the suburbs in Michigan.

671
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,515
Speaker 0: No one was hiring.

672
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:03,400
Speaker 0: Okay, there was nowhere to work.

673
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:07,800
Speaker 0: I also applied to work at that time at a Boston fucking market.

674
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:14,420
Speaker 0: I had no trouble finding because that paid $12 an hour, but they wouldn't hire me because I was going to college.

675
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:20,864
Speaker 0: So when I applied to the construction job, I lied different restaurant Scott.

676
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:30,349
Speaker 0: no one was hiring because Most of the jobs were being taken by people who did not escape the orbit of that suburb Had just graduated high school and needed a job.

677
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,915
Speaker 0: that was going to be their real job.

678
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:37,726
Speaker 1: Anyway, I At college I worked in The crossroads.

679
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:39,560
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you made me a sandwich.

680
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:44,140
Speaker 0: I remember your opening night when you were working there like the first day like we all came over and we all heard of sandwiches.

681
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,740
Speaker 1: I would make sandwiches that were way more meat than you were supposed to put on there

682
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,262
Speaker 0: Yeah,

683
00:39:48,484 --> 00:40:01,473
Speaker 1: and I was the awesomest but then eventually after a long time of working there They're like, all right everyone actually used the fucking scales and then I switched over and worked in the grilling area instead and Then I stopped working there because I found I got an office II job.

684
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:02,095
Speaker 0: Wow.

685
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:03,120
Speaker 0: I'd pretty much the same thing.

686
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,796
Speaker 0: I mean I worked at that the Ritz until I quit in disguise.

687
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,583
Speaker 1: I didn't quit it Just sort of lapsed.

688
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,667
Speaker 1: and in the summer, right?

689
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I got an office II job.

690
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:12,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got the opposite job.

691
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:17,740
Speaker 1: It was the office I was in was like the student services like students would come in and be like, oh I need help with this.

692
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,895
Speaker 1: I'm like, alright, I'll help you.

693
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:26,320
Speaker 1: and then in the summer What happened was obviously don't need as many people for that job in the summer because it's not a lot of students to service.

694
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:32,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was actually working in two different student service offices in the art school like switching between them.

695
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,880
Speaker 1: So I only I was went down to just one of the two offices in the summer.

696
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,920
Speaker 1: But then like this person who had been there for years was like actually I do I couldn't get a real job in the summer.

697
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:42,659
Speaker 1: Let me come back.

698
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:57,880
Speaker 1: So they kicked me out Which was actually a blessing in disguise because I got kicked out to go to the scheduling office instead Which was a much higher profile job and the actual scheduling officer was like super awesome And she brought a little doggy to her wiener doggy to work.

699
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:00,045
Speaker 1: Nice and we just hang out in there.

700
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:06,884
Speaker 1: and she kept like pushing with like the student employment office to like raise the category of That job constantly.

701
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:11,379
Speaker 1: Whoa, I just kept getting paid and I was doing like, you know, like quality work.

702
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:15,100
Speaker 1: It was like it's pretty much like the best job you could have on campus.

703
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,940
Speaker 1: I think mine was and I kept that job like for three years.

704
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,266
Speaker 1: I was almost equally good.

705
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:22,000
Speaker 0: I worked at the GCC at the office of grants contracts intellectual.

706
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:26,108
Speaker 0: I just kept that job as long as in school my only duties were the office.

707
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:35,200
Speaker 0: ladies would need stuff like I do in her office mail, which is great because I get a bunch of envelopes and I just have to deliver them to wherever they had to go all over campus outside of the nice weather all day.

708
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:38,517
Speaker 1: The scheduling office is super good because it wasn't like oh you're a student.

709
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:46,240
Speaker 1: sometimes We'd help a student get their schedule in order But mostly it was schedule of like this class is going to be at one on Wednesday.

710
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:48,240
Speaker 0: Oh, I never had that power.

711
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,739
Speaker 1: It was that kind of scheduling right and I could see things like admissions and like I was.

712
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:54,290
Speaker 1: you know I was in but it's all art school.

713
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,620
Speaker 1: It wasn't the same school.

714
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:58,580
Speaker 0: I don't think they would let you work in the scheduling office of your own department.

715
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,952
Speaker 1: No, I mean that might be I don't know.

716
00:42:00,972 --> 00:42:03,907
Speaker 1: but like I was I had my hands on everything We're and we were getting shit done.

717
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:19,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically where I was I would mostly do data entry like they have these like multi-million dollar contracts to do research at the school and Like some company would basically pay the school and a grant to do the research and all this kind of stuff.

718
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:28,653
Speaker 0: So I would Data enter from the contracts into the system that tracked all that and if I finished all that There was really nothing else to do.

719
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,427
Speaker 0: So I just sat around Switch over to the IT department.

720
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:32,370
Speaker 0: Oh way later.

721
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,655
Speaker 0: That was way later.

722
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:34,638
Speaker 0: That was like senior year.

723
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:36,609
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah senior year I applied to work.

724
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:38,379
Speaker 1: I stayed in the same place right up to the end.

725
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:47,400
Speaker 0: I applied to work at the IT department and they didn't want to hire me at first Partly because I was gonna graduate at the end of the year partly because I never actually worked in IT before.

726
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:51,698
Speaker 0: Apparently they wanted experience from students going to IT school in IT.

727
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,739
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's great.

728
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:05,179
Speaker 0: and They also I think my professor's Disrecommended me because I can't add reputation for being a shit who never came to class.

729
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:07,131
Speaker 0: And I was that legal.

730
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,020
Speaker 1: is that a Lieber violin?

731
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,983
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

732
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:13,180
Speaker 0: but no one no professor in the IT department liked me if they knew not even trumpet gang.

733
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:17,019
Speaker 0: I only had one class with him and he loved me because it was the music class.

734
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:23,480
Speaker 0: He actually taught the IT new media music composition and digital whatever class.

735
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:27,480
Speaker 0: That was the audition and Pro Tools in recording studio class that I took with Katsu.

736
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:30,588
Speaker 0: That was the only class was great.

737
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,532
Speaker 1: What's that guy's name again?

738
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:33,300
Speaker 0: Uh, I'll Biles.

739
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:35,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, Google him.

740
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,496
Speaker 0: See if he's around I'll look up what his business was.

741
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:51,219
Speaker 0: but basically, they didn't want to hire me and then I went off and co-opted IBM and I came back as like a super IT professional and I interviewed them again and they were like you are way overqualified and I was like WTF

742
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,242
Speaker 1: Yeah,

743
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:53,831
Speaker 0: and then basically they

744
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:55,479
Speaker 1: told me in person I was six months ago.

745
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, except now I worked at IBM and now suddenly I'm too good for you.

746
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:00,660
Speaker 1: Like I know just I didn't learn anything there.

747
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:05,440
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess in a school we're like, I mean how many thousands of IT people are there?

748
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,147
Speaker 0: There are more IT students than any other single major and every one of them wanted to work for the IT department of the campus For obvious reasons.

749
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:18,119
Speaker 0: Yes, so they made me a Project manager and said that my expertise your job was upgrading the outlooks, right?

750
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,760
Speaker 0: Yes, my job was managing the project of upgrading the outlooks.

751
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,173
Speaker 1: But you went to a lot of teachers to upgrade those outlooks.

752
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:25,635
Speaker 1: I did.

753
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:26,620
Speaker 1: they were unhappy with you.

754
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,246
Speaker 0: They were super fucking butter.

755
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:32,260
Speaker 0: when I took away their giant giant archive files of like back in the day.

756
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,099
Speaker 0: You know four gigabytes was a lot of space.

757
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:51,539
Speaker 0: And actually that job was so trivial that most of my time they gave me off my own office Downstairs, I just sat there doing nothing playing my gameboy Poking around on the internet because there was literally no work to do because I did it all in like a couple hours.

758
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:53,265
Speaker 1: It was awesome over cloth.

759
00:44:53,346 --> 00:45:06,058
Speaker 0: I paid a lot and I was supposed to mentor people but all the other kids they hired Were goody-two-shoes like teachers pets who knew a lot of like the textbook stuff of IT But didn't know how to actually do anything.

760
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:10,036
Speaker 0: So none of them wanted to actually work with me because I'd make them work.

761
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:21,180
Speaker 0: So I They'd be like, well, I guess I'm gonna go over there and copy the PST file over like no no, no, no, no, you're gonna sit here and learn out learn bash.

762
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:23,430
Speaker 0: You're gonna write a script to do that shit from here.

763
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,599
Speaker 0: That's right, and no one wanted to do that.

764
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,288
Speaker 0: Okay, so, uh, what after that?

765
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,092
Speaker 0: because you had co-op.

766
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:31,779
Speaker 1: I had a co-op where I worked.

767
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:44,448
Speaker 1: I got a cop because James worked there already is it was this place that James already worked and They were basically like they just did contract work of making hardware and software for people Mostly in like industrial places.

768
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,954
Speaker 0: So oh, yeah the batteries.

769
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:47,620
Speaker 1: Well, James was doing batteries.

770
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:52,220
Speaker 1: He wrote software for battery chargers of the military, but at this place.

771
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:06,339
Speaker 1: But then what we the project that we were hired to do was this place that had like a corn syrup Factory had like all these pumps and it was the place that managed the pumps I guess and they needed to monitor the pumps for like temperature vibration, etc.

772
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,514
Speaker 1: It's like if something went wrong They could just think they could just be notified and go to the pump.

773
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:12,839
Speaker 1: that was fucked up and deal with it.

774
00:46:13,102 --> 00:46:13,557
Speaker 0: I got bad.

775
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,087
Speaker 1: So there were three things and we eat.

776
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,999
Speaker 1: James made the smallest most embedded thing which was the sensor that goes on the pump.

777
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:27,240
Speaker 1: I made this thing which was like a single board CPU and I had to had Linux and had 16 megabytes of flash storage.

778
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:36,900
Speaker 1: And I basically had to write a program that would with a wireless like interface on the serial port Collect data from the sensors, right?

779
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:47,760
Speaker 1: Sort of gather it into some sort of useful data structure then write it out as like, you know Some sort of normal protocol and send it over a cellular modem.

780
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:54,285
Speaker 1: I had to like dial in the cellular modem to get to the internet 56k and Communicate with a web server.

781
00:46:54,546 --> 00:46:57,818
Speaker 1: using like soap is what we use then because I didn't even have JSON.

782
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:58,219
Speaker 1: Oh,

783
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:00,566
Speaker 0: yeah Wow Yeah I keep forgetting how long ago all this was

784
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:14,319
Speaker 1: right and I would soap it over to the web server where the and then shitty Alex wrote software that would Take that put it into a MySQL database and had a web interface where you could look at graphs and all this stuff and semi real-ish time.

785
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:15,844
Speaker 1: And we made that.

786
00:47:15,864 --> 00:47:19,236
Speaker 0: yeah, and that was what you also do a co-op for Rudy.

787
00:47:19,898 --> 00:47:20,400
Speaker 1: That was nice.

788
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,925
Speaker 1: So I needed four co-ops.

789
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:23,810
Speaker 1: I need four co-ops guys.

790
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,980
Speaker 0: Remember RIT is a five-year program for IT and CS.

791
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:31,919
Speaker 0: You've got to get a real job that pays real money four times.

792
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:36,294
Speaker 1: Even if RIT hears this and takes away my degree, I don't give a shit.

793
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,317
Speaker 1: It's not like I'll lose my job.

794
00:47:37,478 --> 00:47:41,568
Speaker 1: Yeah so I Had to do four co-ops.

795
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,720
Speaker 1: the first two co-ops were ten weeks.

796
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:44,603
Speaker 1: Well 20 weeks.

797
00:47:44,764 --> 00:47:46,933
Speaker 1: at making that real those are legit co-ops.

798
00:47:47,013 --> 00:47:48,740
Speaker 1: making this thing for the pump people, right?

799
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:51,279
Speaker 1: Then I had to do a co-op.

800
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:55,414
Speaker 1: So I managed to as a camp counselor at cyber camps.

801
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:56,980
Speaker 1: now that should count as a co-op.

802
00:47:57,522 --> 00:48:01,180
Speaker 1: But actually that was only like a two three week camp not a ten week camp.

803
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:04,285
Speaker 1: So whatevs deal with it?

804
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:06,593
Speaker 0: co-ops had to be 10 to 20 weeks.

805
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:08,680
Speaker 1: Anyway, I needed one more co-op.

806
00:48:09,081 --> 00:48:12,431
Speaker 1: I got someone who we knew to fill out the forms.

807
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:15,460
Speaker 1: that said I did a co-op when I didn't do anything.

808
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:21,613
Speaker 0: So so ever full disclosure I did something kind of similar in that I worked at IBM.

809
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:39,806
Speaker 0: Like I got my basically I went from No experience in IT to at IBM as an intern and basically when I got there I realized that I wasn't learning much at RIT and I learned everything I needed to know that I didn't already know what I teach just by working in this IBM like Factory fab

810
00:48:39,846 --> 00:48:41,312
Speaker 1: the job I got after college.

811
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:47,400
Speaker 1: I started working at before I Technically hit the graduation date at RIT, even though I had finished all my work at RIT.

812
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,633
Speaker 0: Yep, so I co-op there after a week.

813
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:53,740
Speaker 0: They were like, oh you're not an intern You're in charge of the data center now, and I just did a real work for them.

814
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,847
Speaker 0: Like I was just IBM employee as far as they were concerned.

815
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,573
Speaker 0: I had to leave to go back to school.

816
00:48:57,593 --> 00:48:58,617
Speaker 0: RIT.

817
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:00,626
Speaker 0: I needed Two more.

818
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:01,859
Speaker 0: I needed one more co-op.

819
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:05,714
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to do all your co-ops at the same place and you're not allowed to end.

820
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,452
Speaker 1: you're not allowed to end on a Co-op end at school.

821
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:11,660
Speaker 0: So then I Didn't feel normal circumstance.

822
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:18,199
Speaker 0: I didn't fill out the paperwork to get credit for the second part of that co-op at IBM.

823
00:49:18,882 --> 00:49:20,853
Speaker 0: So I technically failed the co-op.

824
00:49:21,054 --> 00:49:22,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's not my try.

825
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,803
Speaker 0: I failed it.

826
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:33,040
Speaker 0: then I went back to IBM and just worked there After I was done with all my classes and should have graduated, but I didn't take senior seminar.

827
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:36,855
Speaker 0: So technically I was not a graduate candidate yet.

828
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:42,980
Speaker 0: Like I could not get my degree So I pushed it off as long as I could and then I went back to RIT went to the office.

829
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:49,300
Speaker 0: I was like, look, I tried to get co-ops everywhere But I couldn't and I failed a co-op and I had all this kind of sob story.

830
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:54,080
Speaker 0: So I got the exemption to have done all my co-ops at IBM and I couldn't end on the co-op.

831
00:49:54,401 --> 00:50:02,960
Speaker 0: So I stopped co-oping took one online class while I just continued to work at IBM Passed it and then I just went to next year's graduation.

832
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:05,205
Speaker 0: In fact, I picked up your.

833
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:06,470
Speaker 1: I never went to any graduation.

834
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,920
Speaker 0: I picked up your robe hat and tassel.

835
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,522
Speaker 0: I still have them.

836
00:50:09,944 --> 00:50:10,968
Speaker 1: My sister was complaining.

837
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,554
Speaker 1: She's like, oh we didn't.

838
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:14,120
Speaker 1: no one came to my graduation.

839
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:17,140
Speaker 1: You made me go to Alex's graduation and I'm like, dude, I didn't go to my own.

840
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,209
Speaker 1: I didn't go anyone's graduation for anything.

841
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:19,530
Speaker 0: Hey Scott.

842
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,937
Speaker 0: Do you want your robe and tassel?

843
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:21,720
Speaker 0: I still have them.

844
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,627
Speaker 1: What the fuck do I need it for?

845
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:23,916
Speaker 0: I'll give you your tassel after the show.

846
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:24,420
Speaker 0: I know where it is.

847
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,042
Speaker 0: I don't need it.

848
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:29,158
Speaker 0: It's two says 2005 on it cuz that's the year we both technically graduated can have it.

849
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,309
Speaker 1: I got to Job, I got immediately after college.

850
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:43,500
Speaker 1: I've said oh I got to find a job in New York City now Because I was living at my parents house for a few weeks and I could take the train in New York City And they're sure as hell weren't jobs in Connecticut?

851
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:59,423
Speaker 1: So I found a job at this place called did business services Which is basically they had a website that let you fill out all at once these forms to get small business loans And then they would sell you services to help your small business like oh you need an accountant You need insurance.

852
00:50:59,443 --> 00:51:00,185
Speaker 1: You need all this stuff.

853
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:02,554
Speaker 1: We'll just you know, we'll just give you all those things.

854
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:09,495
Speaker 1: so to simplify your deal and They hired me to make you know web applications, which I'd never done before.

855
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:12,191
Speaker 1: but I figured I'll figure it out I can program and I did.

856
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:18,300
Speaker 1: it was no problem and I made some PHP web app that they really didn't give me a lot of instructions and had it what to do.

857
00:51:18,723 --> 00:51:20,138
Speaker 1: They were just like it needs to do this.

858
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,480
Speaker 1: So I said and it was like the barest spec ever.

859
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:30,140
Speaker 1: It was like a basically a vague description and I made it and I just did whatever I felt was best and they were satisfied.

860
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,856
Speaker 1: I'm like, okay.

861
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:36,324
Speaker 1: Then they opened up like this disaster recovery office in the middle of fuck nowhere And I was living.

862
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,236
Speaker 1: I moved to beacon like a few weeks after starting this job.

863
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:42,343
Speaker 1: So You know, I was.

864
00:51:42,424 --> 00:51:42,965
Speaker 1: then they're like.

865
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,190
Speaker 1: we opened up this place.

866
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,313
Speaker 1: It's close to you, right?

867
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:48,025
Speaker 1: And I'm like, maybe I'm like Oh, right.

868
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:49,858
Speaker 0: You had to drive all the way the fuck out to.

869
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:55,017
Speaker 1: It was basically the border of Connecticut New York where the Connecticut is like a stick.

870
00:51:55,117 --> 00:52:01,820
Speaker 1: it was like, you know Almost an hour driving each way And I'm like, but if I'm gonna go all the way out there every day, you're gonna buy me a car.

871
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:07,604
Speaker 1: they're like, okay, they raised my salary by the amount that the car payment was and They fixed back then.

872
00:52:07,644 --> 00:52:09,111
Speaker 0: we both thought was an amazing idea.

873
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,536
Speaker 1: I mean it was effectively.

874
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:12,327
Speaker 1: they bought me a car Yeah, which was fine.

875
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:13,335
Speaker 1: Someone buys you a car.

876
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:14,060
Speaker 1: You can't really complain.

877
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,531
Speaker 1: They even paid for the tax and you know everything.

878
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,320
Speaker 1: so whatever they bought me a car.

879
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:22,040
Speaker 1: I drove the Mazda out there every day to go to this disaster recovery office.

880
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:34,214
Speaker 1: They put me on another project and they gave me even less of a vague description like I couldn't even work on it because the description wasn't enough and I tried to talk to people to make meetings with the people actually use the existing thing.

881
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:34,475
Speaker 1: cuz I was.

882
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,348
Speaker 1: now I was replacing an Existing thing that was old.

883
00:52:37,368 --> 00:52:39,799
Speaker 1: was that when hopefully making something better, right?

884
00:52:40,961 --> 00:52:41,985
Speaker 1: But no one would meet with me.

885
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,732
Speaker 1: I couldn't get requirements.

886
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:44,214
Speaker 1: I tried to.

887
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:45,540
Speaker 1: I was easy gather requirements.

888
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:48,380
Speaker 1: I kept trying to gather them and they were ungatherable.

889
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,059
Speaker 1: So I was driving to the middle of nowhere to do nothing every day.

890
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:58,236
Speaker 0: now That's funny because that is the same time I had quit IBM because I didn't think there was a long-term career there just because IBM.

891
00:52:58,377 --> 00:53:02,119
Speaker 1: so I just Got tired of driving somewhere to do nothing every day.

892
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:08,560
Speaker 1: So I quit and I got a job at this other place downtown Manhattan, which had cool people.

893
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:11,060
Speaker 1: But we were doing shady business, right?

894
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:15,974
Speaker 1: They were basically making forms online And you try to get people to fill out these forms.

895
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:25,190
Speaker 1: and if you fill out the form we had your personal information including your social security number and We now knew who you were and the form was saying hey Do you need an auto loan?

896
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:25,919
Speaker 1: fill out this form?

897
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,340
Speaker 1: So we would then go to all these car dealers that were our customers who are paying us a lot of money.

898
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:37,960
Speaker 1: And if you live near one of these car dealers, we would say hey car dealer We know someone who lives near you who needs an auto load.

899
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,659
Speaker 1: We will tell you who they are if you give us monies.

900
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:43,785
Speaker 1: And we would do this.

901
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:51,044
Speaker 1: There was not only was there this retail market for this information There was a wholesale market for this information like leads.

902
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:59,163
Speaker 1: so you basically their sales leads and there's like all this automatic buying and trading of personal information of Sales leads.

903
00:53:59,243 --> 00:53:59,584
Speaker 1: like god.

904
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:03,460
Speaker 0: There's a gravel going on here, but there's a geek fable going on here.

905
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:08,075
Speaker 0: So look you got a job After your like initial, you know, RIT job.

906
00:54:08,115 --> 00:54:08,619
Speaker 0: like I had my IBM.

907
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:11,466
Speaker 0: We both had our initial jobs That we learned stuff in.

908
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:16,147
Speaker 0: we both got a job that eventually had no work for us to do because remember I quit IBM And worked at that hospital.

909
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,880
Speaker 0: Oh god where there was no work to do.

910
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,180
Speaker 0: Like I went to my boss and my boss's boss and all their project manager.

911
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,668
Speaker 0: I was like guys is there any project?

912
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,418
Speaker 0: and they give me like nothing.

913
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,370
Speaker 0: one day I didn't even fucking show up to work and no one noticed.

914
00:54:28,173 --> 00:54:29,820
Speaker 1: I could have not driven out to the middle of nowhere.

915
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:30,828
Speaker 1: I probably shouldn't have.

916
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,320
Speaker 1: yeah, I should have stayed in beacon.

917
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,689
Speaker 1: I went to the middle of nowhere.

918
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,500
Speaker 1: I started maybe going out there once a week to check on it.

919
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,605
Speaker 0: I had to use the billing system.

920
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:41,960
Speaker 0: So I'd like log my hours like my billable hours against different projects.

921
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:47,164
Speaker 0: so I started billing 40 hours a week to nothing and No one cared.

922
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:52,764
Speaker 0: and they were still shocked when I quit despite the fact that I was literally doing Zero work.

923
00:54:53,046 --> 00:54:55,800
Speaker 0: So we both had a job that paid well for.

924
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:56,964
Speaker 0: Literally not.

925
00:54:57,306 --> 00:55:04,480
Speaker 1: I mean I was fresh out of college and I the first job made 40k Before and then they added on to that the cost of the car.

926
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:12,520
Speaker 1: So hospital paid 50 and then that was in 2005 and then they opted to 60. a lot That's you know, that's not a lot of money, but it's a lot.

927
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:20,980
Speaker 1: I mean, it's more than people I know make yo today, which is way fucked up Especially considering we didn't know how to do it is more than a lot of people make.

928
00:55:21,221 --> 00:55:24,495
Speaker 0: No when I first got my IBM offered me 40k without benefits.

929
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:25,600
Speaker 0: I was like that is amazing.

930
00:55:26,142 --> 00:55:30,897
Speaker 1: I had benefit every job I've had even the co-op had like profit sharing 401k insurance.

931
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,104
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't one of them.

932
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:41,554
Speaker 1: originally it was a co-op and then I converted into like a full-on employee because every single job I've had to roll over 401k so many times because every single job I've had had one.

933
00:55:41,774 --> 00:55:44,082
Speaker 0: so then so we both were had jobs That did nothing.

934
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:48,860
Speaker 0: that then turned into the shady era of working for people doing a shady stuff.

935
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,124
Speaker 1: What did you do?

936
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:54,840
Speaker 0: that was shady when I started getting into the other projects in the hospital that were all like weird?

937
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:58,180
Speaker 0: Shady kickbacks and I think tax dodges and corruption.

938
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:09,120
Speaker 1: but anyway they had the shady place went out of business because they got bought and then the 2009 happened and cars were hit pretty hard and it's not like they were doing a good business anyway.

939
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:17,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, they went under and then I was unemployed for a little while and then I got the job I have now where I basically went on Craigslist like I always did.

940
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:36,487
Speaker 1: I got every job from Craigslist pretty much yep, and I saw let's find some people making websites and there was some startup and the startup Was making a website that let rich parents Manage the money for their kids trust funds and I was like, okay But they wanted to pay me a lot of money.

941
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:47,454
Speaker 1: and then the other job was Broadway.com where I work now And it was like, oh they're paying me less money But this is actually a totally real and legit business that isn't going anywhere.

942
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:48,196
Speaker 1: and I was right.

943
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:49,640
Speaker 1: and now I make way more money.

944
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,620
Speaker 1: Yeah in there for like six seven I did the same thing.

945
00:56:52,700 --> 00:57:02,540
Speaker 1: I responded to an ad on Craigslist around the same time to work for a company that they didn't say what they did all these Recruiters be calling me but every job I've actually gotten is when I looked for one on Craigslist.

946
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:05,149
Speaker 0: This Craigslist ad was like are you smart?

947
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:12,097
Speaker 0: and it listed like a bunch of stuff that I could do around like database stuff and Shell scripting and Linux whatever and it but primarily was like you have to be smart.

948
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:15,800
Speaker 0: and like Red Bull I was like, alright, whatever and I applied to it.

949
00:57:16,822 --> 00:57:18,407
Speaker 0: I do and it turned out.

950
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:21,757
Speaker 0: it was a broker dealer and I got my job at pipeline and I don't.

951
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:25,208
Speaker 0: they've offered me 65k and I was shocked at that raise.

952
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:25,931
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

953
00:57:25,951 --> 00:57:27,136
Speaker 0: And then two months later.

954
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:36,645
Speaker 0: They're like, uh, yeah you don't know how this works and they gave me a raise to 90 and then the next year to 130. and Then I got bored and quit.

955
00:57:37,147 --> 00:57:40,540
Speaker 0: and now I've worked at you know, where I work now as a product manager.

956
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,866
Speaker 0: So like there's there's sort of interest.

957
00:57:44,287 --> 00:57:46,093
Speaker 0: I guess the the geek fable here.

958
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,440
Speaker 0: people are asking to bring that back in the patreon.

959
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:50,434
Speaker 1: Have skills get job.

960
00:57:50,474 --> 00:57:58,060
Speaker 0: No have skills I'm sorry, but notice like I couldn't get a job working at my own college's IT department because I didn't have experience.

961
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:02,932
Speaker 0: But then I got a job at IBM, which you could get without experience.

962
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,900
Speaker 0: Well, I I kind of scan my way into that job.

963
00:58:05,961 --> 00:58:07,596
Speaker 0: So you want to hear you want to learn like rim?

964
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:10,651
Speaker 0: Messing with people like here's a case.

965
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:14,772
Speaker 1: I got my jobs like going into interviews and saying yeah Look, I actually know what the hell I'm talking about.

966
00:58:14,893 --> 00:58:15,738
Speaker 1: I obviously do.

967
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:16,484
Speaker 1: I hope.

968
00:58:16,565 --> 00:58:17,939
Speaker 1: I hope people believe I know about.

969
00:58:18,442 --> 00:58:27,380
Speaker 0: I went right from listening to Monday episode to the career fair at RIT and Applied to an IBM co-op job that I was not qualified.

970
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:34,398
Speaker 1: The only job I apply I talked to when I was at that RIT career fair was a computer associates And I don't think she wanted to talk to me.

971
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,380
Speaker 1: But my RA was like, oh man, you should totally talk to this guy.

972
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,407
Speaker 1: So she talked to me and I interviewed with her.

973
00:58:40,848 --> 00:58:43,477
Speaker 1: but she was like, why'd you fail calculus?

974
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:44,340
Speaker 1: three like twice?

975
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,390
Speaker 1: I'm like cuz it's really hard.

976
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,400
Speaker 1: You can't pass calculus.

977
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,085
Speaker 1: I'm like, I don't think so.

978
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:51,160
Speaker 1: and just like hire me anyway, and they didn't so like alright, whatever.

979
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:55,720
Speaker 0: So I only applied to jobs for the co-op because remember I needed a co-op like real bad to graduate.

980
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,554
Speaker 0: You gotta get your first co-op in like your second year.

981
00:58:57,594 --> 00:58:58,319
Speaker 0: You're fucked at RIT.

982
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,425
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the thing with our.

983
00:58:59,486 --> 00:59:01,215
Speaker 0: it's so hard to get a co-op right.

984
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:06,600
Speaker 1: getting the co-op is hard But once you get one, it's like there's a reason they have that program because it's like if you have a job.

985
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:14,300
Speaker 1: it's like the rate of Graduated from RIT with a like a computer related degree to getting a job is like a super high rate.

986
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:14,562
Speaker 1: It's like 90%.

987
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:17,399
Speaker 1: also because the retention rate was so low.

988
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:24,060
Speaker 0: Yeah So I applied to jobs that were kind of minimum GPA requirement cuz I had a really high GPA back then.

989
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was so bad.

990
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:27,338
Speaker 0: I was like 3.9 before I took over the anime club.

991
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:28,326
Speaker 1: Yes I got a drop.

992
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:37,903
Speaker 1: I didn't give a shit about grades But somehow my first quarter ever at RIT was like almost all A's and my last quarter at RIT I got like the Dean's list and in between it was like failed calculus 3.

993
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:41,557
Speaker 1: Well, I had the same degree with a 2.0 that you get with a 3.0.

994
00:59:41,557 --> 00:59:45,800
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter I had to maintain a 3.4 minimum or I lost my full ride.

995
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:47,264
Speaker 0: I lost my scholarship.

996
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:52,240
Speaker 1: my scholarship slightly moved up and down a little bit over time, but they never completely removed it.

997
00:59:52,601 --> 00:59:54,733
Speaker 1: So well, they were like, alright, we're getting $100 less.

998
00:59:54,753 --> 00:59:55,095
Speaker 1: I'm like shit.

999
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,080
Speaker 0: So I applied to an IBM co-op job to be a database administrator.

1000
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:07,227
Speaker 0: Now I point out I took the database class at RIT and decided that I fucking hated databases And I was not like.

1001
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:09,039
Speaker 0: I know SQL like you just know SQL.

1002
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:12,635
Speaker 1: I know SQL but I couldn't make my whole job databases and nothing but database.

1003
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:19,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I could not actually Normalize a database nor did I know anything about Oracle one class and that was like hell.

1004
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:19,180
Speaker 1: no.

1005
01:00:19,622 --> 01:00:24,508
Speaker 0: So I applied to the job despite being abjectly Non-qualified for it.

1006
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:34,739
Speaker 0: and then when I went to the interview I wore a nice suit but it wasn't this like the like I wore like a Deep blue shirt and I had my basically made sure that I stood out like I kept my earrings in.

1007
01:00:35,221 --> 01:00:36,868
Speaker 0: My resume was like four pages.

1008
01:00:36,888 --> 01:00:40,723
Speaker 0: I'd like just I wanted to stand out and I figured out.

1009
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:45,939
Speaker 0: I remembered who the people who were behind the booth at IBM's booth at they like the thing looked like.

1010
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:49,880
Speaker 0: So I hung out in the area where the interview was happening.

1011
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:56,300
Speaker 0: There's like a little waiting area at RIT where they do the co-op interviews Like the companies come in and do the interviews the week after the job fair.

1012
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:16,327
Speaker 0: So I hung around there like an hour before my interview and I started making small talk with other people who were waiting in line for the same job interviews at IBM and I basically waited for someone I could talk kind of loudly to about like oh scholarships And what's it like at RIT and how's your GPA?

1013
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:21,040
Speaker 0: and I use this as an excuse to talk a lot about my full ride.

1014
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:27,228
Speaker 0: How I'm only here for the piece of paper because I already know everything and IT is so easy Like this stuff's baby stuff.

1015
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:36,400
Speaker 0: and the guy I was talking to Was like a mirror sort of reflecting the conversation back at me and I made sure those people I recognized before were within earshot.

1016
01:01:37,282 --> 01:01:38,656
Speaker 0: then I go into the interview.

1017
01:01:38,677 --> 01:01:41,106
Speaker 0: I Very I'm very like.

1018
01:01:41,146 --> 01:01:45,968
Speaker 0: I don't lie and I basically when they ask about database stuff I admit I do not have any of that.

1019
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,474
Speaker 0: and the end of the interview.

1020
01:01:47,936 --> 01:01:53,492
Speaker 0: I actually said, you know what I Would like to rescind my own application like as much as I need a co-op.

1021
01:01:53,954 --> 01:01:58,240
Speaker 0: I'm not qualified for this particular job So I will apply to you like I'm backing out.

1022
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,396
Speaker 0: so Because I did all that IBM called me like they kept my resume around.

1023
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:06,485
Speaker 0: cuz the guy was like, oh well Keep your resume on file.

1024
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:07,529
Speaker 0: and they did.

1025
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:11,319
Speaker 0: and then they called me and offered me a completely different job within a couple weeks.

1026
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:14,028
Speaker 0: That was a lot of work.

1027
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:17,425
Speaker 0: to get that job because I wouldn't have got it Otherwise, I don't know what I would have done.

1028
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:20,479
Speaker 0: But once I got that job some other crappy idea.

1029
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:26,319
Speaker 0: Maybe it's hard to get it jobs A lot of people couldn't get co-ops and like had trouble could have gone straight to the hospital step one.

1030
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:28,548
Speaker 0: I don't know if I that might have.

1031
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:31,100
Speaker 0: just I might have just quit and become a lawyer if that happened.

1032
01:02:32,442 --> 01:02:37,544
Speaker 0: But once I got that job and I went in it's like oh the real world IT is Super easy.

1033
01:02:37,584 --> 01:02:44,307
Speaker 1: if you know anything about computers, this job is like I'm having to teach all my co-workers Unix because like nobody knows you Nick.

1034
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,413
Speaker 1: It's like nobody knows.

1035
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:47,296
Speaker 1: they all have Macs.

1036
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,580
Speaker 1: They all have Unix computers.

1037
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:51,260
Speaker 1: No one actually knows any Unix anything.

1038
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,757
Speaker 1: So it's like I think I might have to even make like Unix YouTube videos like learn Unix with Scott or some shit.

1039
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:01,818
Speaker 0: when I showed Someone the T command once it blew their mind like everything is a file.

1040
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:02,540
Speaker 1: That's all you need to know.

1041
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:05,391
Speaker 1: It's files like what my co-work today was like.

1042
01:03:05,432 --> 01:03:06,375
Speaker 1: he actually knew stuff.

1043
01:03:06,396 --> 01:03:07,480
Speaker 1: He was like, do I have to chamad?

1044
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,988
Speaker 1: I'm like, yes, he's like, yeah, it's like what it's like.

1045
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,072
Speaker 1: What do I have to chamad?

1046
01:03:11,132 --> 01:03:13,240
Speaker 1: I'm like just make it 700.

1047
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,469
Speaker 1: He's like, alright, I'm like, do you know what the numbers mean?

1048
01:03:15,831 --> 01:03:16,292
Speaker 1: He's like.

1049
01:03:16,614 --> 01:03:18,140
Speaker 1: it's like RWX or something.

1050
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,612
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh my god, you know more than all the other coworkers.

1051
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:23,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy is already On the road is to die.

1052
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,845
Speaker 1: But then I was like, do you know why?

1053
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:29,159
Speaker 1: it's the number seven and he's like no bitch if bitch shifter.

1054
01:03:29,661 --> 01:03:33,737
Speaker 1: And I'm like, it's simultaneously really awesome and really stupid.

1055
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:36,420
Speaker 0: Yep And DP is the same thing.

1056
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:43,043
Speaker 0: There's there's one register that just has all these bits in a row and ever and it just shifts to the left and ones mean It's working.

1057
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:46,160
Speaker 0: Well sevens meet ones mean is working and zero means it's not working.

1058
01:03:46,462 --> 01:03:49,979
Speaker 0: But the actual number you get will be like three seven seven, which means it's all ones.

1059
01:03:51,209 --> 01:04:00,369
Speaker 1: So Because it's not as long as you think it oh, it's only yeah Yeah, anyway Eight instead of nine bytes or whatever.

1060
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,037
Speaker 0: people who know this bits.

1061
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:11,938
Speaker 0: Yeah It's people who know like like people who know what a subnet mask actually is Like why that is the way it is You're unicorns.

1062
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:14,027
Speaker 0: So I guess the moral is.

1063
01:04:14,107 --> 01:04:16,860
Speaker 1: I think the IT guys at my place know what this subnet mask is.

1064
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,205
Speaker 1: I don't think the programmers know.

1065
01:04:18,265 --> 01:04:28,383
Speaker 0: if you go to a real computer school and you already know about computers Like the classes are not teaching you the useful stuff unless you're a programmer they might be but an IT They're definitely not.

1066
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:35,069
Speaker 0: just get any IT job and you'll be badass at it probably and if you're not You'll learn because you already know a lot of this stuff.

1067
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:37,818
Speaker 0: if you know computers just get one job and notice.

1068
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:45,359
Speaker 0: as soon as I Had that one IBM job the people who previously wouldn't talk to me Fell over themselves offering me jobs and nothing had changed.

1069
01:04:45,762 --> 01:05:03,168
Speaker 1: My advice is that most jobs out there if you need a job in technology Most of the jobs are looking for a specific technology for you to know right like where you want to hire someone who knows X. So what you need to do is just look at what's hot out there right and learn one hot thing Whatever it is.

1070
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:06,833
Speaker 1: Yep, and then Get a job doing that one hot thing, right?

1071
01:05:06,853 --> 01:05:08,060
Speaker 0: You don't have to learn it to be an expert.

1072
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,214
Speaker 0: You have to learn enough to pass the interview and know what that like.

1073
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:13,745
Speaker 0: say someone needs a Windows admin Like you got to know kind of how.

1074
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:14,508
Speaker 0: Active Directory right?

1075
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:16,999
Speaker 1: So for example, the first job I got was PHP my SQL.

1076
01:05:17,402 --> 01:05:22,447
Speaker 1: But it's like yeah, I had set up I you know I've done a little bit of that in college.

1077
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:25,319
Speaker 1: and then the second job I got was also PHP my SQL.

1078
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:36,168
Speaker 1: But towards the end of the job of the shady place We started messing around with git and Django and so when I got a job at Broadway calm I was like I've done the Django tutorial But now I'm a Django master.

1079
01:05:36,188 --> 01:05:39,460
Speaker 1: you get all your skills at specific skills at your job.

1080
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,973
Speaker 1: You just need the general skills.

1081
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:45,952
Speaker 1: Yeah elsewhere What sucks to learn is what you need to learn like real talk.

1082
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:48,720
Speaker 0: our IT did not give me those base computer skills.

1083
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:50,687
Speaker 0: I always I hardly use any.

1084
01:05:50,768 --> 01:05:54,000
Speaker 1: the only thing I learned at our IT was Unix, which I learned on my own.

1085
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:55,204
Speaker 1: They didn't teach it to me.

1086
01:05:55,285 --> 01:06:01,627
Speaker 1: I just happened to learn it while I was there because I had to yep same deal, but Basically are like people.

1087
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,254
Speaker 0: graduating from our IT wasn't so much.

1088
01:06:03,295 --> 01:06:04,259
Speaker 0: they learned a lot about IT.

1089
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:09,640
Speaker 0: It was they were smart enough to make it through IT to get the piece of paper.

1090
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,228
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's that's job.

1091
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:14,895
Speaker 1: Hope to get a piece of paper.

1092
01:06:14,915 --> 01:06:16,100
Speaker 1: You need to have money to begin with.

1093
01:06:16,462 --> 01:06:18,720
Speaker 0: Oh, and I worked at that temp agency, but I've talked about that on keep nice.

1094
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,182
Speaker 0: I'm just so.

1095
01:06:19,202 --> 01:06:25,613
Speaker 1: if you're a privileged white dude who grows up in the suburbs and goes to a good high school and has a Computer when you're growing up in the 90s.

1096
01:06:25,654 --> 01:06:34,287
Speaker 1: Yeah you too Get enough get a job good enough to live in New York City And get money and technology.

1097
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:35,631
Speaker 1: you miss the boat.

1098
01:06:35,751 --> 01:06:36,874
Speaker 1: I'm sorry Millennials.

1099
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:38,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't do anything about it.

1100
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:45,300
Speaker 1: What do you I mean like yeah, I admit that that's the situation But would you like me to like would you would not do any differently in my shoes?

1101
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,204
Speaker 1: I mean like I gotta eat.

1102
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:46,989
Speaker 1: What do you want me to do?

1103
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,840
Speaker 1: my advice to you give you my job.

1104
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,168
Speaker 1: I don't want to sit at the desk all day.

1105
01:06:50,188 --> 01:06:52,180
Speaker 1: You can have it, but I don't know if you can do it.

1106
01:06:52,782 --> 01:07:00,327
Speaker 0: My advice to you is like Scott said learn some of these things like learn the shit out of Linux and Then you just have to scan.

1107
01:07:00,368 --> 01:07:02,880
Speaker 1: if you actually fucking know Unix like I will hire you.

1108
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:04,020
Speaker 1: I need you yeah.

1109
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:12,230
Speaker 0: And once you if you know Linux like or Unix real well Then even if you don't have the pieces of paper or anything You've just got to pull some like what I did an IBM.

1110
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,000
Speaker 0: pull some bullshit to just get in the door.

1111
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:18,129
Speaker 0: Impress the people who are interviewing because they're usually people like me.

1112
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:24,833
Speaker 0: and Scott once you get past that HR wall where I'm just like Do you know what the fixed protocol is?

1113
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:26,539
Speaker 0: do you know what regular expressions are?

1114
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,527
Speaker 0: Write down a regular expression for me.

1115
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:30,570
Speaker 0: anyone.

1116
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,316
Speaker 0: write down a regular expression.

1117
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:33,439
Speaker 0: I'll hire you right now.

1118
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:41,960
Speaker 1: So if your regular expression can actually match something like here make a regular expression that matches a file name and extracts the file extension.

1119
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,444
Speaker 1: You got your hired.

1120
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:44,848
Speaker 0: whoa capture group Scott.

1121
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:47,775
Speaker 0: That is where you do that one capture group.

1122
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:50,222
Speaker 1: You are immediately hired Scott.

1123
01:07:50,323 --> 01:08:02,592
Speaker 0: I've explained capture groups to a dozen people in the last year being people who currently work for you and are being paid or people who work for other companies doing the same kind of and they Don't know how to do this and they don't understand it.

1124
01:08:02,914 --> 01:08:08,959
Speaker 0: the other the other argument I've gotten from people in this industry in Wall Street finance is me blah blah blah blah.

1125
01:08:09,622 --> 01:08:12,215
Speaker 0: Let's let people just set a regular expression for this thing.

1126
01:08:12,657 --> 01:08:15,046
Speaker 0: counter argument No one knows regular expressions.

1127
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:15,468
Speaker 1: regular.

1128
01:08:15,568 --> 01:08:16,692
Speaker 1: is it my rebuttal.

1129
01:08:16,772 --> 01:08:18,920
Speaker 0: No you just don't know regular expressions.

1130
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:33,178
Speaker 1: But I mean it a. regular expressions are often are a tool that is often used for jobs that it should not be used for Hammer used to hit many screws, but you need to only bring it out when you know you've got nails.

1131
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:43,337
Speaker 0: if you know how to navigate a command line Like basic like babies first Linux, and you know how to use grep with regular expressions you can do 90% of all IT work.

1132
01:08:50,245 --> 01:08:52,779
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

Speaker 1: You can't shoot We'll just let it slip.

1146
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:02,803
Speaker 1: Yeah This pause.
