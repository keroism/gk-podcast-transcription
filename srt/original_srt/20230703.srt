1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,497
Speaker 1: It's Monday, July 3rd, 2023.

2
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:14,647
Speaker 1: I'm Rym, I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:19,383
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about raid limiting and throttling and that kind of thing.

4
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:21,009
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,249
Speaker 1: So the air's been poo-poo garbage in the New York area for quite a while now, off and on.

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:42,107
Speaker 1: And because of the wildfires, it's actually worse than it even appears because the AQI, the Air Quality Index, which I feel like, sadly, a lot of people didn't know existed until, for some reason, in the last few weeks, it's one of the most googled for things, but, uh...

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:48,530
Speaker 0: I mean, we've been following it for a few years, but usually I only look at it when, like, I look at, you know, when it's noticeable, right?

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:48,811
Speaker 1: Yeah.

9
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:56,058
Speaker 1: Like, if I go, like, you know, for now, if I went out for a run and, like, I was slow or feeling crappy when I came in, I'd be like, "Is there some

10
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:56,479
Speaker 1: reason?".

11
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,590
Speaker 1: And I'd look and it'd usually be like, "Oh yeah, the AQI was, like, 80.

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,998
Speaker 1: What the fuck were you doing running, Rym?

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,246
Speaker 1: Like, you should have checked that before you went

14
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:02,467
Speaker 1: out.".

15
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:09,630
Speaker 0: Well, I think now, you know, the Apple weather app has it there, but I think, yeah, I think on the weather report, it should just be right there next to the temperature.

16
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:10,788
Speaker 1: Yup, 'cause it is--.

17
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,790
Speaker 0: The problem is we can't forecast it as easily as temperature.

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:22,650
Speaker 1: Yup, the forecasts are all over the place, but, uh, we can kind of forecast the normal AQI because it's actually pretty cyclical and predictable.

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,950
Speaker 1: The problem is, these wildfires, on one hand, but not all the numbers that go into AQI are made equal.

20
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:36,610
Speaker 1: They are different levels of damaging and different levels of harmful, and they affect different people differently, but it gets rolled up into one number.

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,710
Speaker 1: So, like, if it's 50, but it's, like, NO2, Ozone or whatever, that's just irritating.

22
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,390
Speaker 1: But if it's 50 and it's particulates, like tiny ones, that's way worse.

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,350
Speaker 0: Basically, you know, I'm sure particulates come in every conceivable size.

24
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:53,660
Speaker 1: But they have two categories, PM10 and PM2.5.

25
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,430
Speaker 0: Wark size up to, you know, rock size, right?

26
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:07,207
Speaker 0: But the two categories they tend to list are the tens and the 2.5s, and they're measured in, what, particles per meter or something?

27
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:07,590
Speaker 0: Is that it?

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,404
Speaker 1: Uh, 2.5, I want to say it's particles under 2.5 nanometers.

29
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,370
Speaker 0: It's PPM, is the-- whatever, right?

30
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,950
Speaker 0: But the point is, the tens are kind of big.

31
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:26,870
Speaker 1: The term fine particulates, or particulate matter, 2.5, PM2.5, refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in width.

32
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:37,930
Speaker 0: Okay, but yeah, the point is, the ones that are 10 microns in width, it's like, you know, that's not great, but the 2.5 ones are, like, real bad.

33
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,829
Speaker 1: They're so small.

34
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,730
Speaker 1: It's not like, oh, they get in your lungs and irritate your lungs.

35
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,009
Speaker 1: No, ozone irritates your lungs.

36
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:51,968
Speaker 1: They're so small, they get straight into your blood directly, and they're just pumping around in your blood, and if you think that's bad, yeah, it's real bad for you.

37
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,630
Speaker 1: Even worse, not all PM2.5s are made the same.

38
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:02,870
Speaker 1: If it comes from some sources, it's not that big a deal relative to-- Yeah, because you're just saying, okay, it's a particle.

39
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,190
Speaker 0: You know, 2.5 is just saying, there are particles in the air that are this size.

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,390
Speaker 0: Those particles could just be carbon.

41
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:11,850
Speaker 0: They could be poison.

42
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,290
Speaker 0: It could be both.

43
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:17,284
Speaker 0: You know, who knows what it is, right?

44
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,568
Speaker 0: Arsenic gas.

45
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,650
Speaker 1: Especially wildfires.

46
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,730
Speaker 1: They are filled with benzines and all sorts of cancer-causing dangerous chemicals.

47
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:27,625
Speaker 1: They're volatiles.

48
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,569
Speaker 1: They're like gassing off poison constantly while they're in you.

49
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:46,630
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's sort of like, if you were to go out in that and breathe a bunch, right, you're putting a bunch of that shit into your blood because it's 2.5 size, and so that's basically the equivalent of, like, smoking tobacco, right, depending on how much you breathe.

50
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:47,950
Speaker 1: Except every breath.

51
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 1: Imagine if you're smoking, like, five cigarettes at once, but every time you breathe in, you breathe in through the cigarettes.

52
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, or, like, drinking alcohol and it goes right in your blood, only obviously without the fun drunk part.

53
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,530
Speaker 1: Yep, and way more dangerous than even alcohol itself in your blood.

54
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:07,610
Speaker 1: Like, PM 2.5 from wood fires is one of the more dangerous things you can inhale.

55
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,210
Speaker 1: that isn't just poison gas on purpose.

56
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's basically, don't go outside and breathe.

57
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:14,370
Speaker 0: a whole bunch is the point.

58
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:23,530
Speaker 1: So today, we got real lucky, the AQI was, like, 20, so I went out for a run, and I have only run, like, three times in the last three weeks because all this terrible smoke.

59
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,070
Speaker 0: I haven't been able to bike, like, much at all, maybe three times, I don't know.

60
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:36,949
Speaker 1: And, yeah, I was just so much faster than I was even when I ran a couple weeks ago when it was, like, 50, 60, which wasn't a great idea, but I still did it.

61
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,089
Speaker 1: No, I was just, like, way faster and felt way better.

62
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,769
Speaker 1: So we'll see, hopefully it's good when we're at the beach.

63
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:45,868
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

64
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, so anyway, got any news?

65
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:53,129
Speaker 0: I do have a news, let me click on here and see, remember what the news was.

66
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,750
Speaker 1: Massive mineral deposit discovery could mean global battery and solar panel demand.

67
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:05,544
Speaker 0: Yes, I'm sure everyone is possibly aware, you know, that, you know, people keep talking about the rare elements that we need for all these technologies.

68
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:09,507
Speaker 0: we've developed, like, you know, electronics and batteries specifically, right?

69
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:23,850
Speaker 0: And, oh, there's all these rare earth elements and we've got, you know, it's true, there are places on earth where there is, like, child labor digging through poisonous junk heaps to rescue, like, a tiny amount of gold or other shit from some motherboard that was discarded.

70
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,590
Speaker 1: Yep, every dollar you spend is just funded by, at some point, children being exploited to dig stuff out of the ground and then die.

71
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:39,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's also, there are legitimate-ish mines, but they're in countries that we don't like that are not so friendly and they're getting less friendly.

72
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:48,650
Speaker 0: And, you know, if you want electronic stuff in your country and the raw materials for electronics come from bad country, right?

73
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,850
Speaker 0: Well, or, you know, at least country or country, not to say bad country, some of them are bad.

74
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,989
Speaker 1: Well, the governments are bad.

75
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,049
Speaker 0: Country that your country where you live isn't so friendly with.

76
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,502
Speaker 1: Yep.

77
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,390
Speaker 0: Then that's a problem for getting electronic biz.

78
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,770
Speaker 0: You could see a divide in the world of, like, some country has batteries, some country has not.

79
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,150
Speaker 0: One country has very high battery price, another has not.

80
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,889
Speaker 1: And if you want to see what that looks like, like, there's precedent for this.

81
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:20,550
Speaker 1: What was oil to the world for the last several hundred years?

82
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, look, you know, in Iran or Turkey, pistachios, cheap.

83
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,828
Speaker 1: The Bronze Age collapsed.

84
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,930
Speaker 0: Pistachios, expensive and less good.

85
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,828
Speaker 1: Ancient ancient times, the Bronze Age collapsed, what destroyed the entire global economy?

86
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:40,550
Speaker 1: because no one country had the two components of bronze mineable at the same place at the same time.

87
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,904
Speaker 1: You had to trade to get it.

88
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,905
Speaker 0: Yep.

89
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,170
Speaker 0: And so it would be nice if we were able to find, you know, more of these elements, right?

90
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,929
Speaker 0: In countries that our country was friendly with.

91
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,425
Speaker 1: Now, hard mode, it's right there in the name, rare.

92
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

93
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,596
Speaker 0: It's like the earth is.

94
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:03,230
Speaker 0: also you think, oh, well, you know, we've explored, you know, we're going to outer space.

95
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,189
Speaker 0: We're going to the bottom of the sea and dying there.

96
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:10,570
Speaker 0: We should be able we should know the entire contents of the earth.

97
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:24,729
Speaker 0: But no, even though we're exploring space and we can see nebulas and shit, the earth is still like it's like we think, oh, the earth is so small compared to the sun or Jupiter or, you know, the Milky Way.

98
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,570
Speaker 0: But it's like, yeah, but we're still fucking small.

99
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,929
Speaker 0: The earth is still so big compared to us.

100
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:30,695
Speaker 1: And we're just.

101
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,850
Speaker 0: there's a lot of the earth that we don't fucking know.

102
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,830
Speaker 1: We're such a thin skin on the earth, like we're not even talking about how we actually don't know much about what's inside the earth.

103
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:41,650
Speaker 1: Like we don't really have access to the mantle.

104
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,233
Speaker 1: We can't.

105
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:46,329
Speaker 1: we're making guesses and we keep updating them because we've been way wrong about the earth yet.

106
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,470
Speaker 1: But even in that thin skin, that's like point one percent of our of the earth itself.

107
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,769
Speaker 1: We can't find anything on it.

108
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:59,250
Speaker 0: No, but, you know, the people who are scanning the earth.

109
00:07:59,671 --> 00:07:59,913
Speaker 0: Right.

110
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,890
Speaker 0: And looking for stuff in it are mostly mining companies.

111
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:03,372
Speaker 0: Right.

112
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:12,438
Speaker 0: And some of them are doing it in bad ways, like the oil companies that are just like blasting sound at the bottom of the ocean, looking for oil and messing up with all the fish.

113
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:13,968
Speaker 0: They've been doing that for a long time.

114
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:20,268
Speaker 0: No one really only like, you know, the people who are deep into the environmentalism know and are mad about that.

115
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,170
Speaker 1: Because it's it's so horrible.

116
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:27,689
Speaker 1: But yet there's like this catalog of horrors that we inflict upon the world, many of which are so much worse.

117
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,808
Speaker 1: It's like you don't notice the Bokoblin poking at you from behind when you're fighting two Lynels.

118
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:42,690
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in Norway, a country our country is friendly with, they have supposedly, they say, discovered a mega mine.

119
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,370
Speaker 0: Like it's basically like if you were playing Minecraft and you like you chiseled a bit and they're just like fucking diamonds everywhere.

120
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,073
Speaker 0: Right.

121
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:56,521
Speaker 1: Enough minerals to meet, quote, the global demand for batteries and solar panels for the next 100 years.

122
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,270
Speaker 0: Yeah.

123
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:01,810
Speaker 0: So we won't live to see this mine run out if it's real and it seems to be real.

124
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,170
Speaker 1: And we're going to live to see them mine it.

125
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,650
Speaker 1: They say it'll be operational within five years.

126
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:06,253
Speaker 0: Yeah.

127
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,990
Speaker 0: They're they're hurrying up with the operation.

128
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,070
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, shit, let's get.

129
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,655
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

130
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:11,010
Speaker 1: Well, the most important news.

131
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,329
Speaker 1: We got the butter load.

132
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,110
Speaker 1: Norway heavily regulates this stuff.

133
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:26,269
Speaker 0: So while mining and all the Norwegian, the people who live in Norway, the people of Norway, the citizens should be thrilled because they are going to see the benefits of this wealth like very directly.

134
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:28,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the way Norway operates.

135
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,190
Speaker 1: So this is actually, you know, sometimes there's good news.

136
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,950
Speaker 1: There's been a lot of bad news for the past.

137
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:40,490
Speaker 0: Well, it's sort of a good sort of a good news, but it's also sort of a, well, they're going to make a big, nasty mine.

138
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:49,410
Speaker 0: You know, they're going to they they're probably going to make, you know, the most nicest, sustainable kind of mine that our technology and capitalism will allow.

139
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:52,010
Speaker 0: But it's still.

140
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the externalities of bad news for the animals living near the phosphate.

141
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:04,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also the the future of Earth where we don't keep making better batteries and at least move stuff to electric.

142
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,930
Speaker 1: So we have more fungibility of how we power things is way worse.

143
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:16,529
Speaker 1: Like cars are awful, but changing every car to electric would mitigate some of that harm in a material way.

144
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:19,410
Speaker 1: Now, the problem, but that's a separate.

145
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:32,189
Speaker 0: This also will have, you know, effects on, you know, the political climate of the world as the places that had the mines for this kind of stuff are now going to see the value of those minerals go down.

146
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,470
Speaker 0: That's bad news for those countries that are not friendly with our country.

147
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:46,610
Speaker 1: Right now, the EU is currently almost wholly dependent on imports of phosphate rock from external sources, primarily China, Iraq and Syria.

148
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,770
Speaker 0: Countries are country not friendly with.

149
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:52,250
Speaker 0: So they are going to fix that in a few years.

150
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,729
Speaker 0: And so the countries you just mentioned are like, oh, monies, we lose it.

151
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,190
Speaker 0: Norway will get that monies instead.

152
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,969
Speaker 1: And oh, yeah, we'll see how that goes.

153
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:18,170
Speaker 1: I'm sure the dictatorial governments of those countries will have a a solid plan to transition to a more open democracy and join the war and get really cynical once you hit about 40.

154
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:26,090
Speaker 0: But this is the hope, the hope, the effect on our lives is that in like, say, five to ten years, we could see battery prices go down.

155
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:34,926
Speaker 1: Yeah, and and make it, you know, and, you know, or we could see battery prices stay the same, but batteries stop blowing up and burning down buildings.

156
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,927
Speaker 0: because all I think, well, I think, no, I think what you're going to see is the price going down.

157
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:41,810
Speaker 0: because right now we already know how to make batteries that don't explode.

158
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,310
Speaker 0: The problem is people want to save money on batteries, get cheapy ones, right?

159
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,030
Speaker 1: But there is a battery price goes down.

160
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:52,910
Speaker 0: There won't be a reason to buy the cheapy one because the cheapy one will be a good one.

161
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:00,430
Speaker 1: So what, like seven, at least seven major like building fires that burned a building down and killed people happen in New York over the last several years.

162
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:01,970
Speaker 1: From e-bike batteries.

163
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,430
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, Citi Bike has e-bikes and I've dug up the stats.

164
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,790
Speaker 1: You know how many Citi Bikes have ever caught fire?

165
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,130
Speaker 0: I think it's one.

166
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,045
Speaker 1: It's exactly one.

167
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:11,770
Speaker 1: Like there's one that happened.

168
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,390
Speaker 1: There was a second one that caught fire in the Citi Bike warehouse supposedly during QA testing of the batteries.

169
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,768
Speaker 1: So I guess the QA worked.

170
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,938
Speaker 0: Well, I think the thing is with the Citi Bikes, the, you know, even though the yes, the batteries are much higher quality.

171
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,650
Speaker 1: batteries are nine hundred dollars each.

172
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,650
Speaker 0: Yes.

173
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,290
Speaker 0: And that's a part of a large part of the reason they're not.

174
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,748
Speaker 1: You expect some poor delivery guy who has to bring his own equipment to work to get paid minimum wage.

175
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,668
Speaker 0: I could just get stolen.

176
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,269
Speaker 1: Gonna buy a nine hundred dollar battery.

177
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:39,110
Speaker 0: Right.

178
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,509
Speaker 0: But also it's the fact that the batteries don't explode while you're riding.

179
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,130
Speaker 0: Usually it's while they're charging.

180
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,930
Speaker 0: And the Citi Bike batteries are not charging out on the street.

181
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,110
Speaker 0: They're charging at a central charging locations that Citi Bike manages professionally.

182
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:53,245
Speaker 0: Yeah.

183
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:02,510
Speaker 0: Those Citi Bike delivery guy batteries are like being charged on the floor of a restaurant or in some shady bike shop in the back, you know.

184
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:02,844
Speaker 1: Yeah.

185
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:08,850
Speaker 1: I believe there were some Citi Bike stations that where there's like a pilot program to do charging of the bikes on them.

186
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,010
Speaker 1: But almost every Citi Bike station.

187
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:11,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

188
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,810
Speaker 1: They're not charging those bikes.

189
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,169
Speaker 1: That light's just telling you it's out.

190
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,509
Speaker 1: They have a truck that comes around and just physically swaps all the batteries every night.

191
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:18,569
Speaker 0: Yep.

192
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,149
Speaker 0: And then they charge him somewhere else.

193
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,970
Speaker 0: Probably somewhere the electricity is cheap.

194
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:25,970
Speaker 1: Probably somewhere where there's a human being just keeping an eye on him as well.

195
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:33,790
Speaker 0: I imagine they also probably have, you know, I wish someone should make a YouTube video and tour the Citi Bike battery charging facility.

196
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,330
Speaker 1: That's like a Tim Scott kind of thing.

197
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,989
Speaker 1: Like that guy would make that kind of video.

198
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,190
Speaker 0: I wonder if they have like solar panels there or something that's like getting extra energy to cut their electric bill.

199
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:42,839
Speaker 0: Yeah.

200
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:47,808
Speaker 1: Or charging them like off hours like they charge them all at night when there isn't as much demand for AC.

201
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,124
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,506
Speaker 0: I don't know.

203
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:57,330
Speaker 1: I'm just looking up really quick because if I can't find one, I think what I should do is email them and ask, "Hey, could we get a tour?

204
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,525
Speaker 1: Journalism something

205
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:58,770
Speaker 1: something.".

206
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:01,049
Speaker 1: Worst case, they'd ignore me.

207
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:03,510
Speaker 1: I don't see anything.

208
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,930
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone's all right.

209
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,230
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,889
Speaker 0: But it'd be like we should bill it like, "Hey, show us what safe battery charging looks

211
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:09,110
Speaker 0: like.".

212
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:09,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

213
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:10,649
Speaker 1: That would be fun.

214
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,488
Speaker 0: All right.

215
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,509
Speaker 0: Because if the place had set on fire, we would have heard about it.

216
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:19,030
Speaker 0: So it's been working for a long time with no fires.

217
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:24,929
Speaker 1: So in some other news, there is a clusterfuck of news around Twitter, like shooting itself in its own foot.

218
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,690
Speaker 0: Yeah.

219
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,370
Speaker 0: Again again?

220
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:27,109
Speaker 0: Again again?

221
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:27,543
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,250
Speaker 0: This is literally the news every day.

223
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,390
Speaker 0: Why would it be worth talking?

224
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,790
Speaker 0: You know, it was worth talking about when it started happening, when the sale happened and for a few days thereafter.

225
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:39,509
Speaker 0: Because I feel like- What could possibly have happened to make it worth talking about again again again?

226
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,325
Speaker 1: This one actually got like regular news, like regular old CNN.

227
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:50,329
Speaker 1: Now is running articles that and shows like segments that are like, "So Twitter stopped working for you.

228
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:52,069
Speaker 1: Where do you go next?

229
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,442
Speaker 1: How does Mastodon

230
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:53,705
Speaker 1: work?".

231
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:02,129
Speaker 1: Like people are... Because what happened was at the same time, if you're not logged into Twitter now, you can't see any tweets at all.

232
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:02,950
Speaker 1: Full stop.

233
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:11,769
Speaker 1: And I suspect that a huge percentage of all Twitter looks are people who are not logged in at the time.

234
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:12,670
Speaker 0: Yeah.

235
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,730
Speaker 0: People, you know, I guess the embeds still work.

236
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,630
Speaker 0: No, the embeds also stopped working.

237
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,510
Speaker 0: So Twitter embeds also stopped working.

238
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,590
Speaker 0: So every news article on every website that had Twitter embeds now just has an empty square?

239
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:24,927
Speaker 0: Yeah.

240
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,070
Speaker 1: And the preview cards stopped working as well.

241
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,670
Speaker 1: So even if like if you post a tweet into a discord or something now, no preview card appears anymore.

242
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,946
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if you're logged in or not.

243
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:38,209
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

244
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:49,910
Speaker 1: And even worse, if you are logged in, they're limiting any individual account now to some piddly number of viewed tweets per day before they cut you off unless you pay for their special Twitter blue.

245
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,010
Speaker 0: Well, I'm probably viewing way less than that number.

246
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,338
Speaker 0: Yep.

247
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:53,350
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

248
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,810
Speaker 1: The listener is all the listener are posting in the chat like, "Yeah, the embeds also stopped

249
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,616
Speaker 1: working.".

250
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:02,670
Speaker 0: Okay, well, that's the value.

251
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,330
Speaker 0: They just destroyed their value, right?

252
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:07,289
Speaker 1: The only value they had was eyeballs will come here.

253
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,130
Speaker 0: Right.

254
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,330
Speaker 0: The value of Twitter is for the people who are reading, right?

255
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,289
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you can get this feed of stuff that you read, people you follow, whatever, right?

256
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:24,270
Speaker 0: But for the people who post, the value is I can write a line of text or an image and then share it around the web and other people can share it around the web.

257
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:29,410
Speaker 0: If it can't be shared, a tweet can't really go viral or anything.

258
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,509
Speaker 0: Like you just basically defeated the entire purpose of the whole thing.

259
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,770
Speaker 1: So a bunch of other stuff broke as a side effect.

260
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,970
Speaker 1: TweetDeck just stopped working because...

261
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,830
Speaker 0: I use TweetDeck and it has not stopped working.

262
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,650
Speaker 1: Because many people reported that it stopped working because it hits the rate limit almost instantly.

263
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:58,230
Speaker 1: And part of its functionality, supposedly, I got an article here on The Verge about it, that one of the APIs that they shut down was necessary for some functionality in TweetDeck.

264
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:07,388
Speaker 1: Twitter has announced now today that they're shutting down TweetDeck and forcing everyone to migrate to a new version of TweetDeck, like ASAP.

265
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,184
Speaker 0: So there has...

266
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:12,450
Speaker 1: So I can... It's the open preview, that TweetDeck 2 that nobody used.

267
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,730
Speaker 0: Yes, there is, right.

268
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:14,930
Speaker 0: So that's what's happened.

269
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,050
Speaker 0: There has been for quite a while now, like a TweetDeck upgrade that has already been.

270
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,290
Speaker 0: It's like two years old, like... Yeah, it's been around a long time, but not a lot of people used it.

271
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,087
Speaker 0: I didn't use it.

272
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:29,847
Speaker 0: But it seems like now, yes, they do force you into using it.

273
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:30,820
Speaker 0: And so...

274
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,830
Speaker 1: I found... So the specific thing, old TweetDeck...

275
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,710
Speaker 0: They semi force you into using it, I guess.

276
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:45,747
Speaker 1: Old TweetDeck works for tweeting still, but if you actually use it to look at tweets, it basically hits the rate limit so fast that it stops working and all the columns are just empty.

277
00:17:48,611 --> 00:18:05,490
Speaker 1: Twitter, an employee at Twitter claims anonymously that Twitter removed a specific legacy API that TweetDeck relied on to fill the search columns, because that same API they thought was being used for data scraping of Twitter.

278
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:15,890
Speaker 1: But it turns out there's another story from today as well, claiming that what was using that API that they freaked out about was a bug in some other part of Twitter's code.

279
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:21,125
Speaker 1: So they were hitting themselves with the DDoS, and then they shut down the API that was being hit.

280
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,710
Speaker 0: Well, I'm gonna have to try out this.

281
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:29,490
Speaker 0: Yes, it is true, you're forced into the new... I just verified, I was forced-ish into the new TweetDeck.

282
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,770
Speaker 1: Oh, they move fast, 'cause they announced it earlier today.

283
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:36,748
Speaker 0: So now I will have to try out... I never actually tried it, 'cause I was like, whatever.

284
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,070
Speaker 0: But I'll see... The only thing I need is the ability to turn off retweets in this column.

285
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:46,369
Speaker 1: I wonder if turning off retweets will help you not hit the limit.

286
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:52,850
Speaker 0: If it's actually broken and I can't use it anymore, that's no big deal, 'cause hardly anyone's tweeting anymore anyway.

287
00:18:54,651 --> 00:19:00,667
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause one of our friends earlier today was like, "Oh, this thing is a thing, and I don't see it anywhere on the

288
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:00,870
Speaker 1: internet.".

289
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,810
Speaker 1: I'm like, "What are you talking about?

290
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,288
Speaker 1: That's like... That is so deep in the right-wing nutjobosphere that like, why would you even talk about

291
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:07,369
Speaker 1: it?".

292
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:08,967
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Oh, it's trending on

293
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:09,210
Speaker 1: Twitter.".

294
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,828
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "What?

295
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:11,966
Speaker 1: You're still using Twitter for

296
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:12,229
Speaker 1: one?".

297
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,109
Speaker 1: And then he posts a link to it, and I'm like, "Can't click on that.

298
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:16,686
Speaker 1: Not logged

299
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:16,850
Speaker 1: in.".

300
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:25,010
Speaker 1: So yeah, Twitter's getting to the point to where mainstream news, because of this massive outage, is even telling people how to get off of Twitter.

301
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,190
Speaker 1: Which, that's a shame.

302
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,209
Speaker 1: Like, I don't think Twitter's just gonna survive this.

303
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:36,110
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, we knew it wasn't gonna survive for a... Okay, you can still make a custom column here.

304
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:36,610
Speaker 1: All right.

305
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,270
Speaker 1: Custom columns were one of the main reasons I used TweetDeck, and before they added it to the main Twitter, scheduling tweets.

306
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,949
Speaker 0: Well, because there's no ads on it, also.

307
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,279
Speaker 1: So there's one more story about Twitter.

308
00:19:48,319 --> 00:20:01,322
Speaker 1: that was interesting, because Twitter denied this specifically, but a whole bunch of people reported it, and people who block brand accounts when they see ads for them were getting kicked off of Twitter, and they were raising a stink about it.

309
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:11,210
Speaker 1: But Twitter says they weren't kicked off because of that, and I can't find any further corroboration because that story was entirely subsumed by most of Twitter breaking for most people.

310
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,110
Speaker 1: And one last little news, because it's actually kind of a big deal.

311
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:29,088
Speaker 1: It's not a tech news, but the US Supreme Court, if you didn't know, our Supreme Court basically has sessions or terms where for a given year, they will pick all the cases they're going to rule on.

312
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:36,630
Speaker 1: And then there's, like, usually there's a week or two toward the end of it where they really saw a bunch of rulings, like, all in a row.

313
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,870
Speaker 1: And it was pretty much almost nothing but bad news.

314
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,890
Speaker 1: America doesn't have affirmative action anymore.

315
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,149
Speaker 1: Student loan forgiveness is dead.

316
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,870
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of other bad shit happened.

317
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:50,250
Speaker 1: It's okay to discriminate against LGBT people in your business.

318
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:53,210
Speaker 1: It's just bad news all around.

319
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:55,797
Speaker 1: Yep.

320
00:20:57,031 --> 00:20:59,930
Speaker 1: And I don't know what else we can say about that, because there's no legal way.

321
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,487
Speaker 1: Like, that's it.

322
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:11,050
Speaker 1: There is nothing that can overrule the Supreme Court but an act of Congress, which even that might require a constitutional amendment or a John Marshall situation.

323
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,290
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

324
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:24,649
Speaker 1: So you never watched the old Muppet show, which is a fantastic show and highly recommend you watching it.

325
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,090
Speaker 1: There's one segment in the Muppet show that would come in occasionally.

326
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,093
Speaker 1: Dr.

327
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,209
Speaker 1: Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker.

328
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:37,250
Speaker 1: These Muppets are famous, even if you've never didn't know their names.

329
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,110
Speaker 1: You might have only known one of their names, I suspect, especially if you're older.

330
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:41,570
Speaker 1: But they're pretty iconic.

331
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,257
Speaker 1: And I remember as a kid, Dr.

332
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:50,210
Speaker 1: Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker were some of the funnier characters, and I always enjoyed their segments.

333
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:57,631
Speaker 1: So this YouTube video that I just bumped into is just a half hour long YouTube video, 24 Dr.

334
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,830
Speaker 1: Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker clips in their entirety.

335
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:02,527
Speaker 1: I watched it.

336
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:04,350
Speaker 1: They're just as funny as I remember.

337
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,009
Speaker 1: I laughed out loud a couple of times.

338
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,809
Speaker 1: And if you've never seen this stuff, I highly recommend you watch it.

339
00:22:10,694 --> 00:22:11,148
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

340
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:14,409
Speaker 0: What did I have?

341
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:15,910
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

342
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:25,847
Speaker 0: So in 1962, right, somebody interviewed Miles Davis, the legendary jazz cool kids to cool kids.

343
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,590
Speaker 0: And so this was not like your normal kind of interview.

344
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,710
Speaker 0: This is like one of those deep interviews where, like, the person, like, was hanging out with Miles Davis at his house.

345
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:40,870
Speaker 1: And that was the era where Playboy had some, like, we don't fuck around interviews.

346
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,208
Speaker 0: Yep.

347
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:47,370
Speaker 0: Uh, and so this interview is pretty fascinating.

348
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,530
Speaker 0: And I'd say worth reading.

349
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,650
Speaker 0: I guess it's possible.

350
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,350
Speaker 0: It might not be real, but that seems unlikely.

351
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:53,468
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's real.

352
00:22:55,252 --> 00:23:05,650
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is worth reading because it's like, even though this took place in 1962, this interview, you could believe that this was an interview yesterday, right?

353
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,090
Speaker 0: Because nothing that is said in here is I guess all of it is timeless material.

354
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:17,408
Speaker 1: Well, because America was a country built on racially based chattel slavery and white supremacy.

355
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,550
Speaker 1: And here we are, every problem in America's political system.

356
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,174
Speaker 0: 1962 to 2023 is, uh, 40, 50, 60 years.

357
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:26,620
Speaker 1: Yep.

358
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,508
Speaker 0: Right.

359
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:29,229
Speaker 0: And, uh, yeah.

360
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:32,509
Speaker 1: So, oh, the cover of that Playboy article is pretty good too.

361
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:33,544
Speaker 0: Yep.

362
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:43,970
Speaker 0: So I highly recommend reading this article that is available free online with a creative commons license, despite being from a Playboy magazine.

363
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:45,510
Speaker 0: It's really interesting.

364
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,285
Speaker 0: You go to the bottom of this webpage, it's like copyright 1998 Playboy.

365
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,269
Speaker 0: This work is licensed under creative commons license.

366
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:53,649
Speaker 0: Make up your mind.

367
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:58,530
Speaker 1: Maybe, I don't know, maybe Playboy, the company like did something.

368
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,587
Speaker 1: Maybe they released some, I don't know.

369
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:09,868
Speaker 1: But, uh, yeah, this is generally interviews where people ask actual serious questions and then have followups are surprisingly rare.

370
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,970
Speaker 0: He's trying to get to know, right.

371
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,409
Speaker 0: He's actually trying to get to know the person, why he behaves the way he does, what he actually thinks about things.

372
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:22,949
Speaker 0: You know, not just like, you know, the interviews you see with celebrities today, like, so you got a new thing coming out.

373
00:24:23,332 --> 00:24:23,690
Speaker 0: Okay.

374
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:27,150
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some funny anecdote happened in your life recently.

375
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:31,250
Speaker 0: And you know, let's show a clip from your new movie coming out.

376
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:33,967
Speaker 1: You've won all the trumpet polls after yourself.

377
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,830
Speaker 0: This is not a promotional interview.

378
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,288
Speaker 0: He's not trying to promote Miles Davis, right?

379
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,930
Speaker 0: He's not trying to sell Miles Davis, his latest album.

380
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,030
Speaker 0: He's just saying, all right, let's get the public to understand this famous person better.

381
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:50,990
Speaker 1: You've won all the trumpet polls after yourself.

382
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,469
Speaker 1: How would you rank the others after me?

383
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,188
Speaker 1: Hell, there's plenty of great trumpet players that didn't come after me or after anybody else.

384
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:58,730
Speaker 1: That's what I hate so much about critics.

385
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,890
Speaker 1: Cue rant for Miles Davis around ranking musicians as opposed to enjoying music.

386
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:05,350
Speaker 0: That's right.

387
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,850
Speaker 0: Also, list of amazing, all the best drummer players.

388
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,730
Speaker 1: Any special reason you didn't mention Louis Armstrong?

389
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,367
Speaker 1: Oh, Pops.

390
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,170
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.

391
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,450
Speaker 1: I mentioned him because I was talking about modern jazz players.

392
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,167
Speaker 1: I love Pops.

393
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:20,469
Speaker 1: This interview is great.

394
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:24,370
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book.

395
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,850
Speaker 1: This is how you lose the time war by Amal El-Mothar and Max Gladstone.

396
00:25:29,312 --> 00:25:33,068
Speaker 1: I imagine our next Thursday episode will do the show because it looks like a really short read.

397
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,189
Speaker 1: Probably read it at the beach.

398
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'll read it at the beach.

399
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,218
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

400
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,300
Speaker 1: I've seen some divisive opinions about this one from people I know.

401
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:59,057
Speaker 1: I've seen two people we know say they really liked it and one person we know express extreme surprise that it was picked as the book club and looks forward to us hating it, even though you've already read it.

402
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:01,279
Speaker 1: So we'll see how this goes.

403
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:08,100
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we will have a panel at PAX West on games you can't play anymore, details, TBD, but it should be on Sunday.

404
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,390
Speaker 1: I got the panel room and stuff in an email somewhere.

405
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:14,140
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pull up, and we're probably not doing any shows next week.

406
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,360
Speaker 1: So that hiatus will be announced and on purpose.

407
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:18,880
Speaker 1: It's our writer's retreat.

408
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:25,940
Speaker 1: All right, so rate limiting, throttling, that kind of thing.

409
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:46,740
Speaker 1: I guess what I want to say before we get started is that being in capital markets, this has been a big part of my career, like this dealing with this question or this concept in some capacity, and I would say this is in the short list of problems that seem really simple.

410
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:54,280
Speaker 1: But when you actually try to do something specific or implement things, it actually gets shockingly complex and difficult.

411
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:03,159
Speaker 1: Like rate limiting and throttling is one of the harder problems to solve well in computer science, especially depending on the context and how important the application is.

412
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:12,900
Speaker 1: But it is kind of amazing how big a topic this has been in my entire professional career and is still going today and is also directly related to what broke at Twitter.

413
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:27,021
Speaker 1: So I guess the concept really simply, we talk about rate limiting, is just the idea that in a computer, in any computer system, let's go back to our old how computers work type series.

414
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:32,600
Speaker 1: Let's say you want a one computer to ask another computer for something.

415
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:38,160
Speaker 1: Well, how fast could computer one ask computer two for things?

416
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:44,442
Speaker 1: Could I ask one hundred times a second, a thousand times a second, ten thousand times a second?

417
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:52,819
Speaker 0: And this used to not be such a problem in the oldest computers, like, you know, mainframes of timeshares, because like you're literally on the same CPU.

418
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:54,957
Speaker 0: Like you can't you can't ask.

419
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:55,360
Speaker 0: Right.

420
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,343
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like the asking is limited by the same computer that's doing the answering.

421
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:01,645
Speaker 0: Right.

422
00:28:01,685 --> 00:28:08,214
Speaker 0: So it's like if you try to type something in, it's like you're still waiting to even send your question while it's doing stuff.

423
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,500
Speaker 0: You can't like hammer it.

424
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,571
Speaker 0: But as soon as you have networking and different computers.

425
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:13,333
Speaker 0: Right.

426
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:19,678
Speaker 0: It's like one computer could be way faster than another or one computer could get asked by many computers.

427
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:29,324
Speaker 0: It's like unless your network is slower than your computer is, you can get questions coming in faster than answers can go out.

428
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:37,950
Speaker 1: And the problems are very, very different between the requester side and the responder side as well.

429
00:28:38,332 --> 00:28:41,365
Speaker 1: Like, for example, say you're a requester, you're requested stuff from an API.

430
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:45,340
Speaker 1: You've got to deal with any consequences of your asking.

431
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:48,859
Speaker 1: If you ask a lot of questions and it slows down, can you handle that?

432
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:54,280
Speaker 1: Will you crash yourself because you have a queue of open questions you're waiting for answers for?

433
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:03,252
Speaker 1: If a computer asks a question, it has to remember it asks it and have something somewhere reminding itself and taking up resources to do something with that answer.

434
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:14,584
Speaker 1: So if I open 10,000 asks, either I have closed a bunch of those as I had made my 10,000th one or I now have 10,000 things waiting for a response.

435
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:23,227
Speaker 1: But on the on the producer side, it could be even worse because how do you handle someone asking you a lot?

436
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:26,680
Speaker 1: It takes resources to even meter how many requests are coming in.

437
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,232
Speaker 1: It takes resources to do something about it.

438
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:32,887
Speaker 1: If you start rejecting requests, rejections still take resources.

439
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:35,419
Speaker 1: What if you don't have enough resources to even reject something?

440
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,017
Speaker 1: And then there's the sort of the timing nuance issue in between the two.

441
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:47,054
Speaker 1: And this is an area I have a lot of experience with and it's been a weird thorny issue.

442
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:50,787
Speaker 1: I can go actually all the way back to the Istanbul Stock Exchange.

443
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:53,917
Speaker 1: They had a rate limit on an API.

444
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:55,302
Speaker 1: So it's more of a specific example.

445
00:29:55,322 --> 00:29:58,820
Speaker 1: I'm going to file off the serial numbers and some of the details, but they had an API.

446
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:05,977
Speaker 1: There was a rate limit and they said you can send up to five orders per second.

447
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,383
Speaker 1: So all right, five orders per second.

448
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,948
Speaker 1: Now, what does that mean?

449
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:25,968
Speaker 1: Does that mean that I can send five orders in the same microsecond and then wait for one second minus one microseconds and then send another burst of five nearly instantaneous requests?

450
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:33,587
Speaker 1: Can I send an average rate of five if my mean over time goes slightly above or slightly below?

451
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,072
Speaker 1: Is that a violation?

452
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:44,261
Speaker 1: The Istanbul Stock Exchange actually defined it as within a given second, their clock determined the start and end of the second.

453
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,991
Speaker 0: And they look at twelve oh one oh one.

454
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:50,002
Speaker 0: between twelve oh one oh one and twelve oh one oh two.

455
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:58,684
Speaker 0: During that oh one second on the clock in that span of time, I could send a maximum of five orders.

456
00:30:58,805 --> 00:30:59,066
Speaker 0: Yep.

457
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:03,077
Speaker 0: But if I send a sixth order in that window, then it's no good.

458
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:05,384
Speaker 1: But it gets rejected and I get throttled.

459
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:06,306
Speaker 0: Right.

460
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:12,684
Speaker 0: But I could, for example, write like at twelve oh one oh one fifty nine.

461
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,538
Speaker 0: It's like it's about to be the second, the second number two.

462
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:16,903
Speaker 0: It's about to be second number two.

463
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:21,320
Speaker 0: I could slam in five requests instantly right in the microsecond.

464
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:34,405
Speaker 0: And then as soon as the clock ticks over to the second second, I could slam in five more, effectively getting ten requests in two microseconds, one on each side of the at the end of a window and the start of a window.

465
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:35,168
Speaker 0: Right.

466
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:39,905
Speaker 0: And then I just have to wait a whole second before I can do anything else.

467
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:47,334
Speaker 1: Now, this creates a problem for the stock exchange, because now, instead of having a me a rate of five requests per second, that's reliable.

468
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:56,981
Speaker 1: You have extremely high bursts that are double the rate you can expect happening every second, just every second, every second.

469
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,212
Speaker 0: People send ten orders in a two microsecond window.

470
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:03,322
Speaker 1: Now, let's say computer science problem.

471
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:04,948
Speaker 1: You're someone using this API.

472
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:11,769
Speaker 1: You your job, your boss tells you we want to get as many orders as possible to the stock exchange.

473
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,740
Speaker 1: twenty four seven without throttling ourselves.

474
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,347
Speaker 0: Well, stock exchanges aren't open.

475
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:17,990
Speaker 0: twenty four seven.

476
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:24,682
Speaker 1: But OK, well, during the hours or so, because actually that stock exchange has some auction windows and there's after after hours trading.

477
00:32:24,702 --> 00:32:25,284
Speaker 1: Yeah.

478
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:28,860
Speaker 1: Stock stock markets outside of the US have a lot of crazy cool stuff that goes on.

479
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:33,255
Speaker 1: They literally have auctions like, all right, the stock market stops.

480
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:37,373
Speaker 1: Now we're going to do auctions for the next hour and then we're going to go back to the regular stock market.

481
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:38,620
Speaker 0: That sounds fun.

482
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,543
Speaker 1: It actually is kind of fun.

483
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,935
Speaker 0: But since I was sincere, I said it's really fun.

484
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:44,702
Speaker 1: So say the computer science problem.

485
00:32:44,722 --> 00:32:49,944
Speaker 1: you're given, you know, you're a programmer at a bank that that interacts with an exchange or a broker or something.

486
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:51,692
Speaker 1: Maximize this pipe.

487
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:53,700
Speaker 1: Get as many orders to the exchange as possible.

488
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:56,368
Speaker 0: How how are you actually like?

489
00:32:56,449 --> 00:33:06,245
Speaker 1: what logic are you going to write to interact with a system like this where you don't control the network latency, so you don't have perfect control of when those requests get to the exchange.

490
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:10,900
Speaker 1: You also don't know exactly how their clock is synchronized.

491
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:15,620
Speaker 1: You can try to synchronize to the same source, but there's going to be some slew, some drift.

492
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,227
Speaker 1: Your clocks are not perfectly in sync.

493
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,256
Speaker 1: No clock is in sync with any other clock.

494
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,220
Speaker 1: That's impossible.

495
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 1: So how do you do it?

496
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:25,494
Speaker 1: How do you write that code?

497
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:26,598
Speaker 1: And that is a problem.

498
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:31,359
Speaker 0: You just sort of, I think what you sort of have to do is just, you know, queue up the orders you want to make.

499
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:32,342
Speaker 1: Oh, you can't.

500
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:34,388
Speaker 1: Queues are a problem on your end.

501
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:34,689
Speaker 1: Yeah.

502
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,551
Speaker 0: On your end.

503
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:36,033
Speaker 0: Right.

504
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:40,708
Speaker 0: And then just, you know, in whatever order you're going to send them over.

505
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:41,290
Speaker 0: Right.

506
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:43,498
Speaker 0: You know, turn, turn up the rate.

507
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:44,020
Speaker 0: Right.

508
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,064
Speaker 0: Just keep going faster and faster until you start getting rejections and then turn it a little bit slower and then you're good.

509
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:49,466
Speaker 0: Yep.

510
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:59,611
Speaker 1: Because it turns out that is probably the best you can do short of maybe having an AI look at the data and like optimize it slightly further because there's no correct way to do that.

511
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:01,258
Speaker 1: There's no way to optimize that.

512
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:02,764
Speaker 1: You're going to have to do it by trial and error.

513
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:03,587
Speaker 1: because guess what?

514
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:08,344
Speaker 1: At the time, the clock jitter at the Istanbul stock exchange wasn't even that great.

515
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:12,259
Speaker 1: And it was kind of variable how it detected the metering.

516
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:16,053
Speaker 1: because if it got overwhelmed, the metering also got overwhelmed.

517
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:24,282
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't get rejections back right away because you hit them with the burst and then they would back off and they would have a problem.

518
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:31,327
Speaker 1: And then you try to send your next message and then they throttle that one because they just caught up on the metering of your requests.

519
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:39,388
Speaker 1: And that doesn't even get into like, how do you inform the other side?

520
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:44,985
Speaker 1: TCP even has a back pressure mechanism of sorts that doesn't actually super work that well.

521
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:49,440
Speaker 1: But how do you inform a user of an API that they have hit a rate limit?

522
00:34:49,782 --> 00:34:57,952
Speaker 1: How do you throttle someone who's using your API knowing that any response you send back to someone costs resources just like responding to a request?

523
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,842
Speaker 1: Hopefully fewer resources, but it takes resources.

524
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:02,487
Speaker 0: Yup.

525
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:09,323
Speaker 0: Usually with normal HTTP APIs, RESTful APIs and the like is you just send back some sort of 400.

526
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,327
Speaker 0: I forget which exact code number it is.

527
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:12,368
Speaker 0: 429, too many requests.

528
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:37,887
Speaker 0: If someone's sending too many requests to your web server, you identified them by their IP address or something and then you've either got either on your proxy out in front of your application or maybe if your application is real simple, just in the application, it's like you have some way of identifying the user, probably their API key.

529
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:42,240
Speaker 0: And it's like you flagged that account as having too many requests.

530
00:35:42,300 --> 00:36:02,459
Speaker 0: because somehow, and now until that flag is removed, any requests they send, you don't have to bother looking at the request, what it is, you just see who it is and you send back a 429 response and that does take some processing, but much less because you're basically not even spending time to parse the request itself other than what you need to identify who sent it.

531
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:02,580
Speaker 0: Yup.

532
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,637
Speaker 1: That could also be like farmed out to another machine or some other hardware.

533
00:36:05,678 --> 00:36:06,080
Speaker 1: That's something.

534
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:10,157
Speaker 0: yeah, that's something the proxy out in front is going to be handling, right?

535
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:12,708
Speaker 0: Your application server isn't going to see those messages.

536
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:15,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, I built with an API gateway or something.

537
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:19,080
Speaker 1: I built with a team many years ago at a different company for the fixed protocol, you know, my boy.

538
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:24,942
Speaker 1: The architecture generally is you got something called a fixed engine, which is the software that speaks fixed.

539
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:31,828
Speaker 1: So when people are hitting your API, they hit that fixed engine, but then your applications that do logic are behind that fixed engine.

540
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:44,688
Speaker 1: So the fixed engine itself, once it is told this consumer, like this connection, this API, the equivalent of an API key, it's actually stupider than that, but effectively you've identified a person.

541
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:53,040
Speaker 1: Once you decide you're rejects with a type of message that does not need any confirmation from the mothership.

542
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:56,453
Speaker 1: So you're just using resources in that proxy.

543
00:36:56,493 --> 00:37:02,077
Speaker 1: And hopefully your proxy is not the thing that's getting overwhelmed, but your expensive system is not even seeing those requests.

544
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:03,121
Speaker 1: It's already cut them off.

545
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:04,325
Speaker 0: Yup.

546
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:06,794
Speaker 0: But it's still a pain in the ass, right?

547
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:11,454
Speaker 0: They could try to still keep, you know, if they're evil, they could just keep trying to send so many messages.

548
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:17,643
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, if their computer, if your computer is more powerful or faster than someone else's computer, right?

549
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,836
Speaker 0: You can always ruin them basically, no matter what, right?

550
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:24,470
Speaker 0: This is what the D the, the, the D O S is or the D D O S right.

551
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:33,244
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you just have more computers or faster computers or both, and you send someone so much traffic to their service, their internet service.

552
00:37:33,846 --> 00:37:38,003
Speaker 0: It's like, it doesn't matter how well programmed it is or what kind of stuff they've got.

553
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:47,799
Speaker 0: It's like, they, they gonna go down and without the help of someone, you know, bigger and badder with some network shit out in front of them to do something about it.

554
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:47,920
Speaker 1: Yup.

555
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:57,581
Speaker 1: Cause uh, you know, back when I was playing quick too, in that era, there was a thing that you could do and you know, the networks used to be more open and I did this a few times for fun and people did it to me.

556
00:37:57,601 --> 00:37:59,046
Speaker 1: You do a sin flood.

557
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:04,548
Speaker 1: So what you do is you know the IP of a player cause you can actually get that information from your client.

558
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:15,731
Speaker 1: So you're playing and you know, the IP of someone else on the server and you just launch another application, usually from another computer, not the one you're quick on cause that penny of 200 cannot run two things at the same time.

559
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,640
Speaker 1: And uh, you just have it.

560
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:21,288
Speaker 1: open TCP, send sin packets.

561
00:38:21,308 --> 00:38:25,100
Speaker 1: So open TCP connections to random ports on that IP address.

562
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:31,780
Speaker 1: Uh, back before people had like gnats and things that protected them and never do anything with them.

563
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:35,609
Speaker 1: So you're basically keeping them busy by trying to set up new connections.

564
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:46,423
Speaker 1: And it's from many resources to address those that it would basically knock them off the network and they'd get kicked off the quick server.

565
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:47,607
Speaker 0: Yup.

566
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,940
Speaker 1: So how do you rate limit if you don't have an API key?

567
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:58,787
Speaker 1: That's actually why there are companies that provide these services on a global scale because it's a very hard problem to solve.

568
00:38:59,510 --> 00:38:59,650
Speaker 0: Yeah.

569
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,040
Speaker 0: Imagine if, you know, you just have a website, right?

570
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:11,772
Speaker 0: It's a blog and it has a page and the page is a public blog post that you wrote that you want the whole internet to read and then, yeah.

571
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:19,119
Speaker 0: So what if the whole internet, even if you have the simplest web server, it's just static serving pages with engine X, it's like takes no resources.

572
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,828
Speaker 0: The computer it's on is crazy fast, right?

573
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:25,702
Speaker 0: It's like, it's caching the webpage and Ram or something, right?

574
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:27,389
Speaker 0: It's just like, you know, it's like, yeah.

575
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:27,992
Speaker 0: Okay.

576
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:45,104
Speaker 0: So every time someone says, I want to see the webpage, you know, the, what the minimum the computer has to do is take the network HTTP request, parse it, understand it, go get the data from Ram, create an HTTP response, or, you know, right.

577
00:39:45,145 --> 00:39:47,996
Speaker 0: Cause even if it's in a cache, it's still, that's Ram, right?

578
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:50,968
Speaker 0: Or maybe it's the L2 cache in the CPU, who knows, right?

579
00:39:51,269 --> 00:40:00,537
Speaker 0: But it's still cached in some kind of memory in the computer and then send electric electricity out the network with an HTTP response packet, right?

580
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:08,846
Speaker 0: Even if that HTTP response packet in its totality is been cached, you're going to need to at least update the IP address in it.

581
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:13,544
Speaker 0: So it goes to the correct person if multiple different people are asking for the webpage, right?

582
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:21,307
Speaker 0: And so the output on your little network hole, right, for sending out webpages might be the bottleneck.

583
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:22,652
Speaker 0: It's like you have gigabit ethernet.

584
00:40:23,294 --> 00:40:31,058
Speaker 0: If your webpage is one megabit, then you can send that webpage out a thousand times a second.

585
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:36,040
Speaker 0: And if you have a thousand and one people every second asking for the webpage, now you have a problem.

586
00:40:37,382 --> 00:40:45,713
Speaker 1: Now, aside from all the math problems, even calculating the rates and metering them, throttling is actually a way harder problem.

587
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:46,837
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be a thousand.

588
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:47,981
Speaker 0: It would be like a billion.

589
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,483
Speaker 0: I got to do the math.

590
00:40:49,763 --> 00:41:07,164
Speaker 1: But how do you, if you are, so say you are on both sides of the network environment or a game server environment or something, you know, you're like, you have control of the systems.

591
00:41:07,184 --> 00:41:08,692
Speaker 1: Don't worry about DDoSs or anything.

592
00:41:08,873 --> 00:41:10,239
Speaker 0: You can, you control both ends.

593
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,215
Speaker 1: But even then, how do you build systems that won't overwhelm other systems?

594
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:18,607
Speaker 1: Because there aren't really good ways to do this.

595
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:22,786
Speaker 1: Like there are algorithms that you will look up and implement to do this sort of thing.

596
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:26,182
Speaker 1: Like the leaky bucket is actually one of the most used ones in capital markets.

597
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:28,832
Speaker 1: There's various variations of leaky bucket.

598
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,736
Speaker 1: because we have a problem.

599
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:37,729
Speaker 1: Let's say I'm sending you, you and I both work at the same company, and I got a thing that's going to send you orders, like to go execute out at the market.

600
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:40,037
Speaker 1: So my orders are time sensitive.

601
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:46,120
Speaker 1: So if I'm sending them to you faster than you can process them, you're building up a queue in your own system.

602
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:53,849
Speaker 1: So at some point, you might start rejecting things I'm sending because you're going to tell me, "Yo, you've already got a hundred orders open, buddy.

603
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:56,160
Speaker 1: I can't accept any more until I chew through this

604
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,441
Speaker 1: queue.".

605
00:41:57,003 --> 00:42:04,227
Speaker 1: But on my side, I can't just slow down my requests because my requests are coming from an even further upstream system.

606
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:08,340
Speaker 1: It's generating a queue of orders based on a signal from the market.

607
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,662
Speaker 1: That's not tied to any of our technology because that's the thing that is driving the business itself.

608
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:14,706
Speaker 1: You don't have control over that.

609
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:20,270
Speaker 1: Like if you run an oil refinery, you don't have control over how much pressure is coming up out of the ground.

610
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,884
Speaker 1: Sometimes it might go haywire because the earth is terrifying.

611
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:25,389
Speaker 1: So what do you do about it?

612
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:37,187
Speaker 1: So now I can't just queue them all up because if Scott's slower than me and I just queue things up on my side, now all these orders are behind Scott's queue and my queue.

613
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:43,429
Speaker 1: My queue is growing and eventually either I'm going to run out of RAM or Scott's going to run out of the RAM.

614
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:46,142
Speaker 0: Or the market will close and you'll be sitting there holding orders.

615
00:42:46,182 --> 00:42:46,383
Speaker 0: Yep.

616
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:51,641
Speaker 1: Or I've got orders now that are so old nobody wants them anymore and it gets worse.

617
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:58,326
Speaker 1: A common situation in capital markets that I used to sell software to address, an order comes in, it's still in the queue.

618
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:06,734
Speaker 1: It's been in the queue so long, like dozens of seconds, that the market now says "no, never mind" and sends a cancel to cancel that order.

619
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:11,089
Speaker 1: So now I've got an order that's stuck in molasses, not even at the market yet.

620
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,287
Speaker 1: I've got a cancel chasing it, moving even slower than the order toward the market.

621
00:43:17,351 --> 00:43:27,575
Speaker 1: That's the situation where the order is going to hit the market at a fucked up price and send a bunch of shares back that I don't want and then my cancel is going to get there and Scott's system is going to say "what do you mean cancel?

622
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,339
Speaker 1: I already filled that

623
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:28,580
Speaker 1: order.".

624
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:47,835
Speaker 1: And yeah, that's the kind of problem that you could make a living where your whole job is basically trying to handle rates and rate limiting and throttling and the caches and queues and the entire infrastructure of how do you prevent APIs from overwhelming each other.

625
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:47,915
Speaker 1: Yep.

626
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:59,776
Speaker 0: The most basic algorithm that I'll use if I don't want to overwhelm someone else or myself is basically like the exponential back off, which is like "okay, I'll send as many as I can send".

627
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,103
Speaker 0: and it's like "oh, well they started failing.

628
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:06,620
Speaker 0: All right, well I will basically, you know, how often was I sending them?

629
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,663
Speaker 0: What, like, you know, every

630
00:44:07,703 --> 00:44:07,964
Speaker 0: second?".

631
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:12,983
Speaker 0: It's like "all right, well, you know, we'll send them every, you know, two seconds.

632
00:44:13,304 --> 00:44:14,468
Speaker 0: Now, oh, it's still failing?

633
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:17,558
Speaker 0: We'll try every four seconds, every 16 seconds, every...".

634
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,121
Speaker 0: Right?

635
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,813
Speaker 0: We'll keep waiting longer and longer between our re-.

636
00:44:20,854 --> 00:44:23,365
Speaker 0: it's usually when there's like a fail retry situation.

637
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:23,626
Speaker 0: Yeah.

638
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:28,203
Speaker 0: Like you're trying, like, you have one thing you're trying to do and it's like it's not getting through.

639
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:28,324
Speaker 0: Yep.

640
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:32,559
Speaker 0: It's like you just wait a longer period of time between your re-attempts.

641
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,326
Speaker 0: It's like "well, it didn't work.

642
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:36,375
Speaker 0: All right, well, I guess I'll wait an hour now.

643
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:36,897
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:44:36,938 --> 00:44:38,183
Speaker 0: I guess I'll wait four hours.

645
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,388
Speaker 0: If you're using Twitter.

646
00:44:39,408 --> 00:44:41,276
Speaker 0: I guess I'll wait eight hours now.

647
00:44:41,296 --> 00:44:44,251
Speaker 1: You go to check Twitter and Twitter's down and you refresh the page right away.

648
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:45,115
Speaker 1: Then you refresh it again.

649
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:45,940
Speaker 1: Then you refresh it again.

650
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:48,090
Speaker 1: Then you play a game for a while.

651
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,516
Speaker 1: You check back in like five minutes.

652
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:50,400
Speaker 1: Like, it's that algorithm.

653
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,365
Speaker 1: You do it naturally all the time.

654
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,071
Speaker 1: Two people talk at the same time.

655
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,235
Speaker 1: They back off.

656
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:56,700
Speaker 0: Yep.

657
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:01,092
Speaker 1: That back off is actually how Ethernet worked.

658
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:09,002
Speaker 1: Like, that is the fundamental concept with some variations and some nuances of how Ethernet worked before we had fully switched networks too.

659
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:19,315
Speaker 1: It's a really, really common algorithm, but it doesn't work if Scott, the requester, does not have control over when he needs to do the request.

660
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:24,171
Speaker 1: This is more a situation around graceful failure where it ain't working.

661
00:45:24,612 --> 00:45:32,823
Speaker 1: Trying 10,000 times a second over the course of a week if it's still not working isn't helping anybody and the request can't be fulfilled regardless.

662
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:33,867
Speaker 0: Yeah.

663
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:53,898
Speaker 0: I think, you know, the fundamental thing here that's like most upsetting, all right, is that even if you try to be good guy internet, right, and, you know, not do a capitalism or a copyright or an evil and just make stuff freely available on the internet, you make some API, free for all, here's this wonderful data for everybody, all the scientific data, all that, right?

664
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:55,825
Speaker 0: People are gonna request it.

665
00:45:55,966 --> 00:46:02,548
Speaker 0: and it's like now if it's popular and, you know, if it's not popular, it's like, okay, fine, great, you know, okay.

666
00:46:02,588 --> 00:46:07,585
Speaker 1: The more valuable it is for society, the worse you are for having created it.

667
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:08,449
Speaker 0: Right.

668
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:12,328
Speaker 0: It's like if you made something good and valuable that everyone wants, it's like, woohoo, good.

669
00:46:12,408 --> 00:46:12,951
Speaker 0: That's great.

670
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:13,232
Speaker 0: Right.

671
00:46:13,272 --> 00:46:14,377
Speaker 0: It's like I'm providing.

672
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:23,671
Speaker 0: the value that I was trying to give out is getting out in society is better for having this information available to all for free, but now it's unavoidable.

673
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:26,140
Speaker 0: It's because there's so many requests for this data.

674
00:46:26,841 --> 00:46:29,269
Speaker 0: It costs you money to provide it now.

675
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:29,811
Speaker 0: Right.

676
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:31,416
Speaker 0: And now what do you do?

677
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:52,748
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, you know, if you don't want to spend more money to be able to serve more requests faster than your only choice is to serve fewer requests and have some sort of rate limit and like, all right, you know, there's only 10 people can come into my restaurant at once because I only have enough staff to seat 10 tables.

678
00:46:52,828 --> 00:46:53,229
Speaker 0: The end.

679
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,092
Speaker 0: Right.

680
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,456
Speaker 0: I can't do anything about this.

681
00:46:55,476 --> 00:46:57,562
Speaker 0: It's just the laws of physics.

682
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:10,626
Speaker 1: This problem is getting right now, like over the last year, exponentially worse because of machine learning and artificial intelligence, because these models, anyone can make a model.

683
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:13,659
Speaker 1: like you could just buy some cloud hardware and you're good to go.

684
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,094
Speaker 1: Like you can just buy capacity, buy compute, run it on a desktop.

685
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:17,556
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

686
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:19,383
Speaker 1: Like you can just get access to this stuff.

687
00:47:20,226 --> 00:47:27,691
Speaker 1: And there are just people running models all over the place, just pulling in training data from anything they can find on the Internet.

688
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:28,213
Speaker 1: that's free.

689
00:47:28,835 --> 00:47:31,585
Speaker 1: And it doesn't cost them anything to do this.

690
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:38,789
Speaker 0: And they might not even have like particular, like, you know, human special, you know, interest in your data specifically.

691
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:44,308
Speaker 0: It's just, they're just going around finding API's and getting data period.

692
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:46,537
Speaker 1: This is going to be a big problem.

693
00:47:46,557 --> 00:47:47,781
Speaker 1: That's only going to get worse right now.

694
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:55,688
Speaker 1: The consumers, the consumed side is dwarfing the production side on terms of database or functionality based public API's.

695
00:47:56,511 --> 00:48:02,914
Speaker 0: If you just want to have a really good time, go buy a domain, the cheapest domain you can get, make a boring old web page, right?

696
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,709
Speaker 0: And just look at the, and there's like just some text web page or something.

697
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,280
Speaker 0: And like, no one knows about your web page yet.

698
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:12,478
Speaker 0: All you've done is read, you have to have a domain or it's probably not going to work right.

699
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:15,490
Speaker 0: It might work without one, but domain is really going to make it work.

700
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:19,606
Speaker 0: And just no one knows about your web page except you, right?

701
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:21,011
Speaker 0: And you made a domain.

702
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,022
Speaker 0: So I guess people know that this domain was registered.

703
00:48:24,785 --> 00:48:33,116
Speaker 0: And it's like, just look at the HTTP access logs, see who's visiting, like the number of bots and other various things that are coming to look at your web page.

704
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,744
Speaker 0: How much, how often they're looking, right?

705
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:41,462
Speaker 0: It's like for some web page that quote no one knows about, no human has seen, right?

706
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:42,766
Speaker 0: It's like, it's a lot.

707
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:50,919
Speaker 1: But even worse, even if there's a human with intent and it's not some just like mindless model someone built that they're just throwing random training data at.

708
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,035
Speaker 1: So I've seen this in my career too in capital markets all over the place.

709
00:48:56,477 --> 00:49:02,035
Speaker 1: Say, you know, someone wants to send you a transaction of some kind and the thing's down.

710
00:49:02,537 --> 00:49:05,487
Speaker 1: They'll try to reconnect within microseconds.

711
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:14,183
Speaker 1: Like they will just immediately try to reconnect to the point that the reconnection attempts themselves look like a denial of service attack because that costs them effectively nothing.

712
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:16,914
Speaker 1: And the rationale is, what do I care?

713
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:18,440
Speaker 1: what happens to the person I'm querying?

714
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:22,712
Speaker 1: I just want to connect and get my thing done as fast as possible.

715
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:25,542
Speaker 1: Why not just flood them with requests?

716
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:29,260
Speaker 1: That way, when they do come up, I'll be the first one to reconnect to them.

717
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:30,465
Speaker 1: Now scale that up.

718
00:49:30,485 --> 00:49:33,600
Speaker 1: You've got hundreds of thousands of clients all doing this simultaneously.

719
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:41,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, and the thing is sending requests is very, very inexpensive relative to servicing requests, right?

720
00:49:41,704 --> 00:49:50,656
Speaker 0: It's a lot easier to go to a restaurant and say, I would like one salad piece than to make a salad and put it out on the table.

721
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,400
Speaker 0: That's a lot more work.

722
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:55,668
Speaker 0: Right?

723
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:01,640
Speaker 0: So yeah, even if it's the simplest order, I would like that pre-made donut from behind you.

724
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,748
Speaker 0: It's like, that's still more work than just asking.

725
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:23,026
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think this topic has always been an issue in a lot of different computery fields, but I think the concepts of basic throttling and rate limiting, like they are going to become vastly more important right now, immediately ongoing.

726
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:25,680
Speaker 1: Like this is an area you could specialize in and do well.

727
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:30,263
Speaker 0: Well, the reason it's happening right now is obviously the Twitter and Reddit going down the shitter, right?

728
00:50:30,283 --> 00:50:35,766
Speaker 0: I've both run into this problem where they were giving out free access to their APIs to anybody.

729
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:39,243
Speaker 0: Cause it's like, you know, and it's sort of like for both of them, it's like, well, why not?

730
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:39,464
Speaker 0: Right?

731
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:41,111
Speaker 0: Our websites are public websites.

732
00:50:41,814 --> 00:50:43,080
Speaker 0: All the data on them is free.

733
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:46,835
Speaker 1: Anything in API makes it less resources for them.

734
00:50:46,895 --> 00:50:49,126
Speaker 1: Cause if someone's going to scrape them, they'll at least hit the API.

735
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,364
Speaker 1: You can tune and they're not like pulling your actual rendered web pages.

736
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:59,356
Speaker 0: So people come and they get a free API keys for Reddit or Twitter, and they start hitting the Reddit API and they make a Reddit client they use.

737
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:03,974
Speaker 0: or they make a Twitter third-party client and it's like, or they do something else.

738
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:07,527
Speaker 0: They scrape a bunch of tweets from Twitter and use it for purposes.

739
00:51:07,587 --> 00:51:10,820
Speaker 0: They scrape some Reddit and use that for their own purposes.

740
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:21,263
Speaker 0: And it's like that costs, even though they, they have the hardware and the infrastructure to handle a lot of those requests, it costs them money because servicing requests is expensive and asking is cheap.

741
00:51:21,765 --> 00:51:25,637
Speaker 0: So Twitter and Reddit, which have never made money basically right.

742
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,801
Speaker 0: And are now in a, now in a time period where people are, especially those are for-profit companies, right?

743
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,126
Speaker 0: Who haven't been profiting ever.

744
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:34,473
Speaker 0: And now they're in situations.

745
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:40,292
Speaker 1: The evil wizard gave them money and power long ago, came back and asked for his money back.

746
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:41,716
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:51:41,957 --> 00:51:45,027
Speaker 0: And so they're like, well, our costs, we had to reduce costs.

748
00:51:45,308 --> 00:51:47,598
Speaker 0: We can't figure out a way to raise revenues right now.

749
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:47,940
Speaker 0: Right.

750
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,967
Speaker 0: That's so we're going to reduce cost.

751
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:54,163
Speaker 0: We have to find some way to bring the requests down and we can save money.

752
00:51:54,263 --> 00:52:05,923
Speaker 0: And it's like that there, and now as a result, they're breaking, making, when you make requests have either you service less of them or charge people to serve to get them or limit them.

753
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:09,958
Speaker 0: You make your service less useful for the people who are using it.

754
00:52:10,098 --> 00:52:10,921
Speaker 0: And now they're unhappy.

755
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:20,980
Speaker 1: I think this, this fundamental area is one of those challenges to the internet, capital I internet, similar to some of the early challenges of like, there wasn't enough bandwidth.

756
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,404
Speaker 1: Like now we have plenty of bandwidth.

757
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:28,205
Speaker 1: that is holding the internet back from a whole new future paradigm.

758
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:35,231
Speaker 1: Like before broadband, the internet was very limited in what it could be used for just getting enough bandwidth.

759
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:39,546
Speaker 1: You hit this critical mass where suddenly people could do cool things that were

760
00:52:39,707 --> 00:52:40,831
Speaker 0: literally impossible

761
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,316
Speaker 1: before, except like you

762
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:56,157
Speaker 0: can't watch a video because even if we have the whole internet to ourselves, the pipe that sends the data is cannot send enough data for you to get a video frame in a 30th of a second or even a 24th of a second.

763
00:52:58,122 --> 00:53:08,601
Speaker 0: And therefore the video will render, you know, in less, you know, than the frame rate it's supposed to be, unless you wait for the whole video to download, which could take for fucking ever.

764
00:53:09,123 --> 00:53:16,122
Speaker 0: So like, whereas now I can send you a 4k video and I can send a full frame of 4k data, right?

765
00:53:16,423 --> 00:53:20,275
Speaker 0: Faster than the time you're going to spend watching that frame.

766
00:53:20,636 --> 00:53:23,164
Speaker 0: And so you can push play and 4k video immediately.

767
00:53:23,184 --> 00:53:32,532
Speaker 1: I mean, the number of 33, 6k BPS modems it would take running simultaneously for you to watch this YouTube live street of geek nights is staggering.

768
00:53:33,676 --> 00:53:34,679
Speaker 0: It's a lot, a lot of.

769
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:34,879
Speaker 0: So,

770
00:53:35,682 --> 00:54:03,570
Speaker 1: but I think what's cool about this is that right now, regardless of what people are trying to use it for, the reality is that the internet, these platforms, despite the fact that there's fewer websites and these platforms got too big, the data, the information, the things that people have put on the internet are so valuable to humanity that now we don't have a way to distribute them to anyone, mostly because of capitalism.

771
00:54:04,232 --> 00:54:13,887
Speaker 1: So what that does imply to turn this into a positive spin is that there are a lot of people who have a lot of really good ideas and are trying to do cool things.

772
00:54:13,907 --> 00:54:29,943
Speaker 1: And someday I hope we will solve these problems and this data will be available in a way that people can make cool things, just like podcasts and video games and all these things appeared on the internet because we solved this one fundamental technological problem bandwidth.

773
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,211
Speaker 0: I think you will need 6,000, 33, 6 modems to watch a 4k video.

774
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:39,202
Speaker 0: That sounds plausible.

775
00:54:39,764 --> 00:54:43,939
Speaker 1: I was, I was about going to do the math for the stinger, but you beat me to it.

776
00:54:44,921 --> 00:54:46,226
Speaker 0: I think you need 6,000 modems.

777
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:50,743
Speaker 1: I had, I had one and it didn't even run at a full 33, 6 cause it was plugged into our worst phone line.

778
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's do, let's do a 56k modem.

779
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:55,438
Speaker 1: You know, I never had a 56k modem.

780
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:56,921
Speaker 0: I did.

781
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:57,703
Speaker 0: I had a USB one.

782
00:54:58,165 --> 00:55:01,515
Speaker 0: Uh, you need 3,500 ish 56k modems.

783
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:04,184
Speaker 1: And you would have had to live in a place where 56k worked.

784
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:06,472
Speaker 0: It worked right.

785
00:55:06,492 --> 00:55:07,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't work in most places in America.

786
00:55:07,977 --> 00:55:11,230
Speaker 0: I played tribes 2 on a 56k modem, which actually was not bad.

787
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:12,695
Speaker 1: Still that game.

788
00:55:12,716 --> 00:55:15,869
Speaker 1: Uh, well, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna talk a little bit about that game in our PAX panel.

789
00:55:15,889 --> 00:55:17,054
Speaker 1: Okay.

790
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:24,418
Speaker 1: Cause I realized, I guess we're done with the show, but I realized there's a progression we could do in the panel of games.

791
00:55:24,638 --> 00:55:26,065
Speaker 1: This game's not impossible to play.

792
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:26,709
Speaker 1: It's just hard to play.

793
00:55:26,729 --> 00:55:27,795
Speaker 1: And you're not going to put the effort in.

794
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:32,095
Speaker 1: this game's not impossible to play, but you have to acquire specific exe files.

795
00:55:32,256 --> 00:55:33,601
Speaker 1: And like, there's a complicated thing.

796
00:55:33,983 --> 00:55:39,284
Speaker 1: This game's almost impossible to play, but you gotta find one of the few dudes who has battle tech pods.

797
00:55:39,645 --> 00:55:40,227
Speaker 1: There's only a few.

798
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:43,079
Speaker 0: I feel like I'd rush, I think there's a cooler idea to do.

799
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,157
Speaker 0: the panel of these are games that are alive because of one dude somewhere.

800
00:55:47,197 --> 00:55:48,786
Speaker 1: I feel like we're going to incorporate that in a big way.

801
00:55:48,826 --> 00:55:55,520
Speaker 0: We should, we should try to bait, you know what I feel like that could be the whole panel, like games that are, that you can play because one dude is holding it together.

802
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,972
Speaker 1: I got the battle tech guy's card from the last magfest.

803
00:55:59,033 --> 00:55:59,816
Speaker 1: I went to that.

804
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:00,378
Speaker 1: he was there.

805
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:00,699
Speaker 0: Yeah.

806
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:01,622
Speaker 0: Battle tech pod.

807
00:56:01,722 --> 00:56:04,611
Speaker 0: You got tribes two guy, dragon dice sort of right.

808
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:19,439
Speaker 0: Uh, the net runner people, the, uh, you know, it's not, that's not, that doesn't have to be literally one dude, but it has to be some sort of special community interest effort that is like, you know, that is holding this game, right.

809
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,690
Speaker 0: And keeping it from just fading away into history.

810
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:26,692
Speaker 1: If we, if we get enough people to turn that into a deeper panel, I think, you know what I'd call it, keeping the scene alive.

811
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:35,903
Speaker 0: Could be there's those guys who saw packs once with their holding meridian 59 MMO, the realm MMO, whatever those people are doing.

812
00:56:35,963 --> 00:56:36,244
Speaker 0: Right.

813
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:36,706
Speaker 1: Yeah.

814
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,469
Speaker 1: They're doing something.

815
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:45,059
Speaker 0: There's several MMOs that are that there's people who've got like the, the tech mobile, uh, they updated every, the PR.

816
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:48,311
Speaker 0: they update the roster every year and have a little tournaments up.

817
00:56:48,352 --> 00:56:52,624
Speaker 1: The realm is down for maintenance because of the 4th of July holiday.

818
00:56:55,591 --> 00:56:56,152
Speaker 1: Wow.

819
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:58,999
Speaker 1: And their website is also down for the holiday.

820
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:00,562
Speaker 1: We'll be back on the 5th.

821
00:57:02,065 --> 00:57:02,566
Speaker 0: Interesting.

822
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:18,785
Speaker 1: There were, uh, before it went down for the holiday weekend, 178 people logged in, which honestly that is more than we're logged in over a holiday weekend in like 1997.

823
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:24,200
Speaker 1: When I was playing this game, there'd be like 4,000 people on the server total on a day.

824
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:32,528
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

825
00:57:32,568 --> 00:57:36,179
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat Lee for web design and brand.

826
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:36,540
Speaker 1: Okay.

827
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,404
Speaker 1: For the logos.

828
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:42,664
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew.com for show notes, discussion, news, and more.

829
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:45,576
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one, but four different shows.

830
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:50,357
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

831
00:57:50,678 --> 00:57:54,675
Speaker 0: Geek nights is distributed under a creative comments attribution 3.0 license.

832
00:57:55,097 --> 00:58:01,263
Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.

833
00:58:01,404 --> 00:58:05,384
Speaker 1: and the Patrion Patrion's for this episode of geek nights are Ellen, Justin, Gigi dread loose.

834
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:17,960
Speaker 1: And if I case care makes music, Chris, the doc, Clinton, Walton, text, then Joel Hayes, petty rhymer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, sure about holding a bunch of people who are given less than $5 per month, which is an appropriate amount to get access to that RSS feed and such.

835
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:21,212
Speaker 1: Uh, you might've noticed Patrion roll out some video.

836
00:58:21,693 --> 00:58:24,341
Speaker 1: So we're going to try uploading the Utena show to it.

837
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:28,835
Speaker 1: And also about most of, well, many of our geek nights lectures over the years.

838
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:39,994
Speaker 1: as a good backup, uh, also just to try it out and, you know, it might be a way to start doing the rest of the pony show without hitting all those YouTube DMCA problems we keep hitting.

839
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:41,741
Speaker 1: So, uh, stay tuned on that.

840
00:58:41,781 --> 00:58:42,464
Speaker 1: No promises.

841
00:58:42,805 --> 00:58:44,455
Speaker 1: We got to try this out in detail.

842
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:45,969
Speaker 1: So, uh, for now.
