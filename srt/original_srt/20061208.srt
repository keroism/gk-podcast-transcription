00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:12,160
Speaker 0: So, a lot of you seem to really like cheesy 80's style metal, and for some reason seem to really like that tiny, half-assed clip of Zelda music that I put in as Thing of the Day music one day to make fun of myself.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:20,400
Speaker 0: Thus, I present to you as a gig night special, a few minutes of me playing just kind of unedited.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,880
Speaker 0: I just was recording, playing around with the keyboard, and I decided, you know what?

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,400
Speaker 0: I'll just hit record, and whatever I play, I will put up.

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,619
Speaker 0: This is incredibly cheesy, and not very good, but you wanted it, so you're gonna get it.

6
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:39,040
Speaker 0: If this is your first episode of Geek Nights, I will point out, as I always do, that this is not a normal episode of Geek Nights.

7
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,820
Speaker 0: This is not even an episode.

8
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:42,700
Speaker 0: This is what we call a special.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,360
Speaker 0: I highly recommend that you go to the feed and look at any other episode besides this one.

10
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:10,400
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

11
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,040
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

12
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:24,940

13
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,139
Speaker 0: We say feeds plural because Geek Nights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

14
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,259
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

15
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,860
Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

16
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,839
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

17
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:50,300
Speaker 1: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com, or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

18
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,860

19
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,379
Speaker 0: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

23
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,140
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

24
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,700
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
