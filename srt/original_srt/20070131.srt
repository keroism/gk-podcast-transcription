1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,309
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday January 31st.

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:15,300
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and I'm rim, and this is geek night.

3
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:20,020
Speaker 0: Tonight we discuss anime openers and closers.

4
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,838
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:30,128
Speaker 0: So today we were gonna talk about one of our favorite animes.

6
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,370
Speaker 0: well Maybe not in the super top, but it was a favorite anime.

7
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,710
Speaker 0: Yeah But we got the DVD for Netflix so we could watch it again because we haven't seen it in many years.

8
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:39,954
Speaker 0: And what do you know?

9
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:43,625
Speaker 0: in the middle of the second episode this DVD was scratch.

10
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:48,608
Speaker 1: Oh in the middle you mean exactly 45 seconds from the end.

11
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically yeah.

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:01:01,862
Speaker 0: So we had to send it back to Netflix and use the Netflix scratch DVD complaint form And I'm sure they will send us a non scratched one pretty soon, but until then We had to change our plans for tonight's show.

13
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:14,529
Speaker 1: yep, so in the very least I'll tell you all this if you haven't seen dominion tank police I would highly recommend if you don't have anything better to do that you pick it up and watch it because We are going to review it in mostly glowing terms

14
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,019
Speaker 0: Mostly it.

15
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,387
Speaker 0: There's not much wrong with it really.

16
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:17,890
Speaker 0: yeah.

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,267
Speaker 0: I mean especially unless you're one of those people who just refuses to watch anything older than the year 2000.

18
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,058
Speaker 1: well considering on For the era in which it came out.

19
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,810
Speaker 1: I'd say it's a fairly stellar anime for what it's worth.

20
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:34,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's just say it holds up today As well as it did back then and we'll leave the rest to the episode on it in the future.

21
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:38,483
Speaker 1: So speaking of anime manga comics, what do we got in the news?

22
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:40,009
Speaker 0: well three?

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,720
Speaker 0: Conventions are now cancelled.

24
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:43,968
Speaker 0: Let's check this out.

25
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,455
Speaker 0: ready Gen Con.

26
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:48,430
Speaker 0: so Cal which is a gaming con, but that's not the point.

27
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:59,305
Speaker 0: It's a southern Cal that this gen con is a big gaming con and they have two conventions one in Indianapolis Which is the main one and they have another one in Southern California in Garden City.

28
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,869
Speaker 0: Oh, no never mind not Garden City That's the second convention.

29
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:11,454
Speaker 0: Anyway according to a letter from the CEO of Gen Con declining attendance and a lack of dealers room reservations caused the Convention to end.

30
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:13,640
Speaker 0: but Gen Con indie will still happen.

31
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:14,563
Speaker 0: that's so.

32
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:16,890
Speaker 0: apparently gaming is less popular in so Cal.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:24,622
Speaker 0: That's kind of weird because I look in like the board game You know gaming community, and I see a lot of action in so Cal.

34
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:27,290
Speaker 0: you know that board games to go podcast guy.

35
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,610
Speaker 0: He's in so Cal and there's a lot of people on board game geek in so Cal?

36
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,690
Speaker 1: Well, not just so Cal, but in the whole country.

37
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,192
Speaker 1: I mean even when I was growing up there were a lot of gaming cons in Michigan all over the place and Even around here.

38
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,943
Speaker 1: I mean uber con is always packed to the brim with people.

39
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:48,430
Speaker 0: yep, so you think Southern, California Is a pretty big place for gaming relative?

40
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,557
Speaker 0: you know maybe it's not as big as like some places in Texas like Austin or whatever, but it's huge and They can't support a gen con.

41
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:57,481
Speaker 0: It's kind of weird.

42
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:02,369
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just the gen cons are so big They need a lot more support, and they refuse to shrink it.

43
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,267
Speaker 1: It might also have to do with how much more expensive convention space is out there.

44
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:06,970
Speaker 0: that is true.

45
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,329
Speaker 0: It is quite expensive to have a convention out there.

46
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:22,029
Speaker 1: I mean we always forget that we live in the Northeast where there's a convention center in every major and a lot of minor cities But they're all relatively small which it means they're perfect for the kind of convention that you can reasonably pull off.

47
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,945
Speaker 1: yep However, there still are enough big ones to have big cons.

48
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,998
Speaker 1: there are indeed You know what I like the East Coast a lot like.

49
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:33,961
Speaker 0: remember that convention center in Hartford that we that we went to for a Kinetic on yep, I mean what if you had it you could fit.

50
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,290
Speaker 0: if you had a big convention you could fit it in there.

51
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:41,141
Speaker 0: Yeah, you definitely be Otacon big But it might be like the second biggest to Otacon.

52
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:44,232
Speaker 0: if you filled up that whole place katsu khan would fit there Just fine.

53
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:52,125
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that might be a good idea too anyway except that katsu khan outside of DC is like I don't know a dog out of water with a bot.

54
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,130
Speaker 1: There's really no metaphor.

55
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:55,585
Speaker 1: I'm going with there, but katsu khan has to stay in DC.

56
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:56,250
Speaker 0: That's true.

57
00:03:56,952 --> 00:04:01,245
Speaker 0: Anyway, the second convention that canceled is the Garden City anime festival.

58
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:02,389
Speaker 1: Oh, I never heard of that.

59
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:02,770
Speaker 1: is it big?

60
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:05,290
Speaker 0: I never heard of it either.

61
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:08,205
Speaker 1: Huh, I wonder if that has anything to do with it folding.

62
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:09,129
Speaker 0: apparently it's in st.

63
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,570
Speaker 0: Charles Ontario, and it was canceled due to an unexplained conflict among the staff according to the CEO.

64
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:22,408
Speaker 0: Well, this sounds like the typical case of political infighting bringing about everyone's doom.

65
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:30,947
Speaker 1: yep I probably shouldn't mention any names, but I have been involved with or heard tell of or Staffed conventions that had similar problems.

66
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:37,719
Speaker 0: Yes We see this problem all the time and we constantly warn people against it And we tell people how to avoid it.

67
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,734
Speaker 1: god at the at the anime club summits We do at conventions.

68
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:45,391
Speaker 1: probably the biggest advice we give aside from you know show this kind of anime Do.

69
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:50,766
Speaker 1: this kind of thing is always don't let people control this club or dumb.

70
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:54,741
Speaker 1: be smart Don't try to don't be idiot.

71
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,510
Speaker 1: Just basically don't let politics get into it.

72
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:04,284
Speaker 1: We warn people constantly that if you're not vigilant Idiots will take over any club and run it into the ground as fast as they possibly can.

73
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,156
Speaker 0: yep, so you know we Constantly warn against it.

74
00:05:08,357 --> 00:05:18,290
Speaker 0: and here's an example of it yet again disappointing us because up We told you so and the third convention that decided to cancel is anime Express in Daytona Beach.

75
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,903
Speaker 0: Well sex with us anime world order guys in Florida.

76
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,330
Speaker 0: They're one less convention.

77
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:30,661
Speaker 0: apparently Not quite sure because it's not very well worded But it sounds like the convention.

78
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,850
Speaker 0: first of all there was a Christmas tornado.

79
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:51,580
Speaker 0: I don't know if they're tall about a real tornado or not, but There's reconstruction from a tornado, which is causing them trouble, but also the Embry riddle aeronautical Aeronautical university's administration, so I guess I'm assuming that this is being held at the Embry riddle aeronautical university and some rooms there

80
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:52,155
Speaker 1: ha

81
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,219
Speaker 0: apparently several serious breaches of trust.

82
00:05:56,581 --> 00:06:11,371
Speaker 0: Er a you policy and the law itself were witnessed and documented by e ra you Safety over the past two years of the convention and that has unfortunately cast The AG anime club and a very bad light in.

83
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:11,993
Speaker 0: e ra?

84
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:21,300
Speaker 0: use eyes all right, so this is the classic case of people not What keeping control of the feet members of their convention and their club?

85
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,526
Speaker 1: Basically it seems like claw.

86
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:40,620
Speaker 1: anime clubs and anime conventions can go into two directions when they fail When they fail due to reasons beyond control you know like staff being stupid either There'll be some sort of split between two factions, and then one will try to spin off a con and thing will just collapse or This will happen now.

87
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:45,920
Speaker 1: I said I wouldn't name names But this is just too close to what happened to me when I was a freshman at RIT.

88
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:57,456
Speaker 1: I went to join the gaming club called our way the Rochester Wargamers Association and Guild and At the second meeting someone walked over to me and said hi.

89
00:06:57,838 --> 00:06:58,280
Speaker 1: What's your name?

90
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,800
Speaker 1: And I said oh my name's rim, and they said congratulations.

91
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:05,886
Speaker 1: You're now the webmaster of Rudicon a gaming convention.

92
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:09,560
Speaker 1: you are also a member of the board of directors, and I said who are you?

93
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,766
Speaker 1: Wow, so I became.

94
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:13,851
Speaker 1: that was the first convention.

95
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:14,856
Speaker 1: I was ever staff on um.

96
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:25,196
Speaker 1: To cut a long story short my first duty as a member of the board of directors Was to apologize to some of the vendors from the euro webmaster.

97
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,300
Speaker 0: Why did you have to deal with vendors?

98
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:33,528
Speaker 1: Well no like most small cons are run by a board of some kind and I was the head of the website Whatever group like.

99
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,980
Speaker 1: I was the webmaster, but I was also just you know a staffer.

100
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:50,396
Speaker 1: one of my first duties was to go with another staffer and Apologize to the previous year's vendors for the fact that the convention had effectively stolen money from them and Promising that it would not happen again.

101
00:07:50,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Speaker 1: mm-hmm I add to that about a thousand other problems ranging from Nobody could tell me the password to the hosting to no one could tell me who registered the domain name To no one could tell me when the convention was so I could set up the free registration.

102
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:21,637
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of this unique situation I don't know if it's a unique Situation but is that you were actually trying to do the job that some random person came along and gave you in our typical Professional manner that we are known for while nobody else was.

103
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:27,218
Speaker 0: therefore They were dumbfounded when they saw you actually trying to work, and they continued to not work.

104
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,368
Speaker 0: in fact They counteracted your overworking by working less.

105
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:36,548
Speaker 1: well you see I was excited about it at first because I had never that was before I'd Even been to an anime convention that I just.

106
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:40,563
Speaker 1: that was the moment when I thought you know what I'd love to be staff of All this business.

107
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:41,567
Speaker 1: I want to be a big shot.

108
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:42,250
Speaker 1: This will be fun.

109
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:46,450
Speaker 1: I'm gonna work hard and show these people I'm cool and confident and maybe someday.

110
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:47,476
Speaker 1: I'll be the con chair.

111
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:54,040
Speaker 1: well I quit being the webmaster after a few months and The con I guess happened.

112
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,505
Speaker 0: I think it didn't happen.

113
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:56,688
Speaker 0: then it happened the next time.

114
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:05,480
Speaker 1: all I know is that that convention very shortly thereafter Folded completely for almost the exact same reasons that this convention has failed.

115
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,608
Speaker 0: I say both of the reasons.

116
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:14,573
Speaker 0: so except for the reason oh yeah all three reasons that con Didn't have enough people is it just like Gen Con?

117
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:25,777
Speaker 0: it had infighting among the staff Just like Garden City anime, and there was bad stuff going on Just like the Express yep, well it was all three one.

118
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:41,964
Speaker 1: I guess we should ask People who live in Florida if they've heard of the AG anime club, but um your anime club You know your anime club the club where you get together and watch Japanese cartoons and talk about them and possibly yell at the screen to make National news.

119
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,709
Speaker 0: it's not really nationally.

120
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,855
Speaker 1: It's national news in terms of the anime world.

121
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,560
Speaker 0: It's not national news.

122
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:51,153
Speaker 1: It's on the internet on a semi to make the anime news network.

123
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:52,558
Speaker 1: It's national news.

124
00:09:52,598 --> 00:10:00,140
Speaker 1: It's anime Whatever of anime fans who care even more than a little bit as opposed to a naruto fan.

125
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:04,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's out there for your anime club to be called out for being terrible and incompetent.

126
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:14,840
Speaker 0: All I can say is if you have a bunch of people getting together to enjoy anime those people probably shouldn't be breaking the law Or making a safety nuisance.

127
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:15,783
Speaker 0: This is you know.

128
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:22,307
Speaker 0: this is why places like Otakon have all these rules like no signs no giant sticks No guns, etc.

129
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:22,689
Speaker 0: Etc.

130
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:22,850
Speaker 0: Etc.

131
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,171
Speaker 0: Etc.

132
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:24,819
Speaker 0: No don't end up like that.

133
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:33,073
Speaker 0: That's why you should do what Otakon says and not complain about it because if you complain about it That means you agree with the AG anime club.

134
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:33,696
Speaker 0: That's bad.

135
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:39,497
Speaker 1: Wow I mean I've met some bad anime clubs in my day, but this really takes the cake.

136
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:46,567
Speaker 1: unless there's something We really don't know about that happened, but somehow yeah the details I imagine would be very humorous and also very sad.

137
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:52,258
Speaker 1: if anyone knows if any of our listeners know about the AG anime club or this convention.

138
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:59,199
Speaker 0: If you know more details about the closings of any of these three conventions tell us because we will be entertained.

139
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,010
Speaker 0: yes We don't really care about like spreading secrets.

140
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,757
Speaker 0: You know we don't even know these people.

141
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,440
Speaker 0: We don't really care.

142
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:07,971
Speaker 0: Oh, we just want to be entertained by stories of people fucking up royal.

143
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:13,300
Speaker 1: if we wanted to spread secrets about anime cards We could anyway, so what's your news?

144
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,402
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure you're all aware of free comic book day If you're not.

145
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:23,648
Speaker 1: very simply it is a day once a year sponsored by the comic industry where if you go to any Semi reputable comic book store.

146
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,480
Speaker 1: They will give you a pile of free comic books.

147
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,200
Speaker 0: Yep, it depends on the store.

148
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,384
Speaker 0: How many free comic books?

149
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:30,427
Speaker 0: in which ones you will get?

150
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:34,380
Speaker 0: but basically the idea is that since no one reads comics anymore?

151
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:43,255
Speaker 0: They try to bribe people into liking comics by once a year giving away a few comics for free To try to convince you or to get you hooked.

152
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:47,430
Speaker 0: well this year It's on Saturday like a drug dealer giving you the first cocaine for free.

153
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:48,373
Speaker 1: It's on Saturday.

154
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:49,296
Speaker 0: It's really weak.

155
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:56,718
Speaker 1: Saturday May 5th 2007. now you might remember that last year we went to the comic book shop near us to get our free comics.

156
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,386
Speaker 0: well a Terrible comic shop.

157
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:00,238
Speaker 1: yeah, it's also the comic shop.

158
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,551
Speaker 0: Well Dragon's Den is a comic shop.

159
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,100
Speaker 1: Dragon's Den is a lot further away.

160
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,868
Speaker 0: It was a lot further away, but it's also 10,000 times nicer than the place We ended up going to.

161
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,704
Speaker 1: not the greatest election though No, not the greatest, but anyway We go to this comic should I can.

162
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:29,680
Speaker 1: a good selection outside of the city and basically it was a scary fat nerd And his scary fat nerd staffer guy, and it was nothing, but like so ten-year-old kids Silver Age comics piled up Everywhere like under tables and then whatever new comics were out piled up everywhere.

163
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,347
Speaker 1: I don't think they sold anything, but straight up comic books.

164
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,941
Speaker 0: It was dank and Vile.

165
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,158
Speaker 1: It smelled bad.

166
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,050
Speaker 0: This is a bad place.

167
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,721
Speaker 1: And we walked in and you know we ask hey can we have our free comic books?

168
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:48,730
Speaker 1: and the guy seemed really kind of pissed Off that we wanted our free comic books, but yet we weren't buying any comics.

169
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:54,030
Speaker 0: Oh, he handed us free comic books cuz it's free comic book day, and we left without buying anything.

170
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:55,670
Speaker 0: It's just shady-ass store.

171
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:02,746
Speaker 1: I mean they didn't even have manga other than there was a little bit of lone wolf and cub like in the bottom corner And it was way overpriced.

172
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:05,085
Speaker 0: yep Like over.

173
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,140
Speaker 1: the Suggested price was his price, and it was more.

174
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,269
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean you shouldn't participate in free comic book.

175
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,606
Speaker 0: No, why would you ever turn down free comics?

176
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:13,170
Speaker 1: Yeah?

177
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,455
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll admit that last year.

178
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:21,463
Speaker 1: I liked maybe ten percent of the free comics, but The free comics that I didn't episode about him didn't we?

179
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:21,865
Speaker 0: we did.

180
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:22,970
Speaker 0: we should continue that trend.

181
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:26,636
Speaker 1: I think we will all right, but yeah I don't see anything particularly of note.

182
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,648
Speaker 1: a gemstone is putting out a Walt Disney Mickey Mouse whoo.

183
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,801
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a new Battlestar Galactica flip book.

184
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:33,905
Speaker 0: I don't really care about that.

185
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:34,327
Speaker 1: what?

186
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,010
Speaker 1: what's wrong with you?

187
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,673
Speaker 0: You can have that.

188
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:46,378
Speaker 1: Archie comics is putting out Archie comics great and Apparently Antarctic is putting out something called pirates versus ninjas number one, which I'm buying that it's gonna be here We can.

189
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:54,175
Speaker 1: oh I hate to say it But as much as I love pirates as much as I love ninjas and as much as I love anything that combines the two It's a bad comic.

190
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:55,822
Speaker 0: I know one you.

191
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,790
Speaker 1: I don't think you can make a good comic about that.

192
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,060
Speaker 0: I got a comic recently cowboys vs.

193
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:00,603
Speaker 0: Aliens.

194
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:06,464
Speaker 0: It was so Generic and just cliche there was nothing to it.

195
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:07,890
Speaker 0: It's like I could have made this comic.

196
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:14,154
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not the art, but every other part of it was just yeah, it's exactly what it says on the cover It's not.

197
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:15,559
Speaker 0: it's so shallow.

198
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,141
Speaker 1: Oh good.

199
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,285
Speaker 0: I imagine pirates vs.

200
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,530
Speaker 0: Ninjas to be equally shallow.

201
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,936
Speaker 1: That's what wild card is putting out.

202
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:21,181
Speaker 0: What are they putting out Gumby?

203
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,587
Speaker 0: Oh sweet?

204
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:22,969
Speaker 0: Yeah?

205
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,662
Speaker 0: Gumby and Gumby and owly are the most exciting comics they are.

206
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,970
Speaker 0: that says something good and something bad.

207
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even mention owly because owly and corgi is.

208
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:34,839
Speaker 1: We're gonna buy that anyway.

209
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:36,307
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if it's a free comic book.

210
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:36,930
Speaker 1: owly is great.

211
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:40,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, if you don't like owly you're not a human being.

212
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,050
Speaker 0: of course owly is for nursery school kids.

213
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:45,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what but it's biggest fans are like college people.

214
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:52,890
Speaker 0: It's like imagine if like all of a sudden c-spot run was all the rage in the college crowd.

215
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,525
Speaker 1: You know I wonder if we could manufacture those dr.

216
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,929
Speaker 0: Seuss books, man They're hot among the 40 year olds.

217
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:04,368
Speaker 1: I'll bet we could put together some sort of meme viral marketing that would make that happen perhaps?

218
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:05,314
Speaker 0: oh Man, you know what you want.

219
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:06,157

227
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:31,678
Speaker 1: It's worth seeing once.

228
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:32,240
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny.

229
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I walked into it.

230
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:36,300
Speaker 0: You know I didn't watch it on purpose.

231
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:37,738
Speaker 0: It's just other people decided to watch.

232
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:41,032
Speaker 0: well I came in with and I just went along with it the lowest of expectations.

233
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:46,272
Speaker 0: I went in with expectations so low I expected to turn it off in 10 minutes and go do something else.

234
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:59,162
Speaker 1: well aside from the fact that the movie was actually pretty Good, okay, it had this one Ongoing gay where two guys playing a video game, and they eventually have a conversation along the lines of you know how I know You're gay.

235
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:00,185
Speaker 1: You know how.

236
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,293
Speaker 0: I know you're gay, and it's you know.

237
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:02,935

Speaker 1: It's very good days like shit.

239
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:11,917
Speaker 1: It's definitely two friends Ragging on each other in a very semi non-offensive, but slightly offensive yet funny.

240
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:20,665
Speaker 0: nonetheless way yep And after we watch this movie anytime someone said something that could possibly be a homosexual innuendo like hi My name's Scott Reuben.

241
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:24,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone else would be like hey You know how I know you're gay.

242
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,773
Speaker 1: in fact that is the joke behind the.

243
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:29,524
Speaker 1: you know how we know rim and Scott are gay Thread in the forums.

244
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:30,307
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

245
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,760
Speaker 1: one of the most popular threads that god damn it god damn it anyway.

246
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:46,189
Speaker 1: So someone decided to do something clever and reinvigorate this joke by taking various clips of Batman and Superman hanging out and Putting the audio from those scenes over this.

247
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:52,700
Speaker 0: so Batman is like hey Superman Okay, and Superman fly around wearing your underwear on the outside.

248
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:58,598
Speaker 0: It's really good It's really and you don't use your x-ray vision to look in the girls locker room often enough.

249
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,910
Speaker 1: now Especially if you haven't seen that movie this my.

250
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,780
Speaker 1: I don't know if this will be more funny or less funny.

251
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:06,516
Speaker 1: I imagine it'll be more funny because you won't know the jokes that are coming up.

252
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,327
Speaker 0: Hey Batman You know how you're gay.

253
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,858
Speaker 0: one word bat to see.

254
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:20,119
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah Okay, so my thing of the day has a lot of links so anyone who goes to the show notes to click on this.

255
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:23,440
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a lot of links there for you because they're not just doing it.

256
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,443
Speaker 0: I mean one thing.

257
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:34,686
Speaker 0: my thing of the day is anime dance now not anime dance in general but specifically Dances created by anime.

258
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:42,776
Speaker 0: now the earliest instance of this that I know of because I only know of Three instances and then the fourth instance is a music video.

259
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:43,580
Speaker 0: It doesn't really count.

260
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,150
Speaker 1: Well, we can't really talk about things that were before our time.

261
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,857
Speaker 0: Anyway, right because we don't know.

262
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:49,623
Speaker 0: however There are three.

263
00:17:49,824 --> 00:18:16,148
Speaker 0: there is a trend among certain anime shows to in the usually in the closer But also sometimes in the opener to have the characters of the show perform some sort of choreographed dance and then have a good song going with it and it gets it catches on and then People in Japan will just do this dance in the street everywhere and people dancing in the street Will create popularity for the show etc.

264
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:22,666
Speaker 0: Now the first instance of this which is a show called Koto cha or was it child's toy?

265
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:23,007
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

266
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:28,660
Speaker 0: Yep, and they think the second opener had a dance called the ultra relax.

267
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,618
Speaker 0: Now you can go on the internet.

268
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,868
Speaker 0: You could find a video of the second opener and you'll go.

269
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,777
Speaker 1: oh that We actually we know this dance.

270
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,650
Speaker 1: We used to do it a lot at anime music nights when that song would come up.

271
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,754
Speaker 0: It's quite a fun dance.

272
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:57,230
Speaker 0: now you will also note that there are videos of the guy next people doing this dance.

273
00:18:57,432 --> 00:19:10,121
Speaker 0: Yes in the street There are videos of random Japanese people doing this dance in the street and someone made a funny music video that combines the opener with Evangelion characters.

274
00:19:10,202 --> 00:19:11,370
Speaker 0: that is quite high quality.

275
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,321
Speaker 0: Now that was the first time and you'll go.

276
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,470
Speaker 0: that's the anime show that has a funny dance.

277
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,157
Speaker 0: Well, that was true until mohoromatic came out.

278
00:19:19,598 --> 00:19:22,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, mohoromatic is not the best show.

279
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:23,990
Speaker 0: No, it's really not.

280
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:42,833
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about mohoromatic, but at the end there's the mohoromatic mambo And we didn't know and we showed the show in club and we saw this dance in the closing credits and we all looked At each other.

281
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:43,999
Speaker 1: god damn it.

282
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,221
Speaker 1: Now.

283
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,327
Speaker 1: We got to learn this thing.

284
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,143
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, we didn't really like mohoromatic.

285
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:51,459
Speaker 0: In fact, I only ever saw One episode of it.

286
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:59,170
Speaker 0: I read spoilers But the at the end of the show, there's a catchy song and the characters do a dance.

287
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:00,955
Speaker 0: So what can you do?

288
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:05,990
Speaker 1: the dance is actually pretty easy except there's this step in thing that it's real easy to just fall over.

289
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,216
Speaker 1: Yeah, I fell over twice trying to learn.

290
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,761
Speaker 0: you got to practice it a few times now.

291
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:20,668
Speaker 0: after the mohoromatic came out some guy Who's pretty awesome made perhaps that one of the best anime music videos ever the mambo leo Which is a song that has nothing to do with anime.

292
00:20:21,974 --> 00:20:31,010
Speaker 0: You see me inside outside You hold me so tight, we'll dance and party all night, mambo mambo get ready, so kiss me in the moonlight.

293
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:36,249
Speaker 0: You know it always feels right, we'll dance and party all night, mambo mambo get ready.

294
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:41,550
Speaker 0: And it's a various music video with lots of different anime in it.

295
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, the credits to the video are almost as long as the video itself listing every anime.

296
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,470
Speaker 1: they pulled stuff from it to this day.

297
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:52,930
Speaker 1: I can't find the actual frames where some of the anime they talk about are in this music video.

298
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,864
Speaker 0: I know the Trigun one is the saxophone.

299
00:20:54,945 --> 00:21:07,424
Speaker 0: yeah anyway There's no real dance in it because it's just a whole bunch of clips of anime characters Moving in ways that may be interpreted as dance but fast fast forward backward to back rewind.

300
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:17,225
Speaker 1: when we were at RIT anime and for various reasons para para was really popular back then and We decided to have some sort of you know choreographed thing.

301
00:21:17,265 --> 00:21:25,470
Speaker 1: that'll be our club thing and the president at the time Luke decided to put this together and he Choreographed kind of based on some other things.

302
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:38,630
Speaker 1: There's a lot of influences to it this dance to the song and all of us on the executive board including the ultra relax Yeah, and we learned it, and then we performed it for club to the song at an anime music night or something.

303
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,744
Speaker 0: We also did it in front of club while the video played.

304
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:43,490
Speaker 1: well the club Fucking loved it first.

305
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:51,446
Speaker 1: They just ate it up and whenever there was a dance party ever We would play that song about 3/4 the way through like there'd be that like the secret.

306
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:51,727
Speaker 1: did it?

307
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:51,968
Speaker 1: did it?

308
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:52,209
Speaker 1: did it?

309
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:52,430
Speaker 1: did it?

310
00:21:52,590 --> 00:22:02,730
Speaker 0: Well because the song starts at this clapping right so you can sort of if you start playing the song Everyone who knows the dance can start clapping and walking towards the area where they will perform the dance.

311
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:12,045
Speaker 1: So we get to the point where every year there'd be you know ten people at the front of the dance hall Doing this choreographed skit dance while the rest of the crowd is just screaming.

312
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:12,708
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

313
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,310
Speaker 1: This is crazy.

314
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,155
Speaker 1: What are they doing?

315
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,402
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

316
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:26,790
Speaker 0: yep now There is a new popular anime called the melancholy of Haruhi, Suzumiya And I did not watch it yet, but I know it is popular and some people say it is good.

317
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:27,618
Speaker 0: I cannot comment.

318
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,345
Speaker 0: I have not watched it.

319
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:42,568
Speaker 0: however Unbeknownst to me until recently the closer of this show has a dance perhaps the most Complicated anime dance yet, and we may spend an entire day this weekend learning it as is our duty.

320
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,559
Speaker 1: yes I mean we.

321
00:22:44,841 --> 00:23:00,070
Speaker 1: if you don't know us very well Or maybe you just found us from all these podcast directories or people that talk about us We like attention We like to dance - yeah, we like music and dance music.

322
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:15,010
Speaker 1: So when we go to anime con especially back in the day before we did this Podcasting business or even back at RIT when we had anime dance nights Not only would we dance to anime music and techno and whatever But we always like to do some sort of thing that would put us at the center of attention.

323
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:19,341
Speaker 1: Oh, no rim and Scott trying to be the center of attention you say hmm.

324
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:20,104
Speaker 1: Well.

325
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,370
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why they podcast so much.

326
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,370
Speaker 1: We really have no choice.

327
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:31,530
Speaker 0: But to learn this dance and at some you mean learn you mean completely master and memorize every single step in this dance.

328
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,364
Speaker 1: Maybe we should put a video up of us doing the mambalayo dance.

329
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:35,630
Speaker 1: cuz we've got that thing down.

330
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,795
Speaker 1: I could do it in my sleep.

331
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:40,229
Speaker 0: I forget it's coming back to me now, but I don't remember all that.

332
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:45,606
Speaker 0: yeah Cross cross yep, I remember most of it, but not you know what.

333
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:50,509
Speaker 1: if there's enough interest We'll make a video at some point and put it on the website so all of our listeners can learn it.

334
00:23:50,630 --> 00:24:01,678
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway go look at my thing of the day And you will see videos of all the anime dances in there you know and Animated and live-action and mixed-up forms.

341
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:29,047
Speaker 0: you need to do it as well as the characters in the anime.

Speaker 0: That's right.

344
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:45,435
Speaker 0: It could it could be anything ranging from spontaneous dancing in the hallway to a Legitimately registered cosplay.

345
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:45,897
Speaker 0: who knows?

346

347
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:58,720

348
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:12,162

Speaker 1: If you if someone sends us a video of them doing it before katsu khan I'll just cry.

352
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:26,950
Speaker 0: well no because I'm sure if you go on YouTube you can find bunches of people already doing this.

353
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:28,930
Speaker 1: Oh, it has to be a video of you and we'll know.

354
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:31,187
Speaker 0: Well, we know we'll know.

355
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:37,942
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll know all right Just like huh that looks like a bunch of Japanese people.

356
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,190
Speaker 1: Huh, you're not Japanese.

357
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:41,956
Speaker 0: Hmm all right.

358
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:50,021
Speaker 0: anyway as I said before we were gonna do the show on Dominion tank police And we can't because the DVD was scratched, but you should watch Dominion tank police.

359
00:25:50,302 --> 00:25:55,818
Speaker 0: so anyway the idea of all these anime dances Gave us a good topic for today's discussion.

360
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:01,274
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about anime openers and closers now We're gonna.

361
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,244
Speaker 0: We're gonna do this in separate parts first.

362
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:08,386
Speaker 0: I want to ask a question What is the purpose of an opener and a closing now?

363
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:09,410
Speaker 1: That's an interesting question?

364
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:18,045
Speaker 1: I mean on one hand an opener especially for the first episode of a show or the first few episodes is The first thing you experience about the show.

365
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:19,393
Speaker 1: that's the moment Are you?

366
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:22,030
Speaker 0: I don't know about that because you know back in the day?

367
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:25,146
Speaker 0: Maybe a show would come on and the opener was the first thing you saw.

368
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:31,770
Speaker 0: but nowadays You know especially first episodes it seems like there's a short prologue before the openers start.

369
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:33,736
Speaker 0: I true, so it's not really.

370
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:34,559
Speaker 0: you know the thing.

371
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,830
Speaker 0: it doesn't no longer has the purpose of letting you know.

372
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,073
Speaker 0: Hey, the show's on.

373
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:43,387
Speaker 0: you know it used to be Voltron starting right now, or GI Joe is starting right now.

374
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,640
Speaker 0: You know or Transformers is starting right now, but it's not now.

375
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,014
Speaker 0: There's a prologue, so that's not the purpose of the opener I don't.

376
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:54,667
Speaker 1: but at least back in the day I mean there were a lot of shows where the first episode has the opener.

377
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:05,991
Speaker 1: and Just by looking at the opener to at least a good opener or at least an average opener you can know Basically what kind of show it is unless it's one of those shows that pulls a 180 and the opener has nothing to do with It.

378
00:27:06,011 --> 00:27:10,183
Speaker 1: I mean you watch the Sailor Moon opener You know exactly what you're gonna get out of Sailor Moon.

379
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:13,154
Speaker 1: you watch the big O opener You know exactly what bigos.

380
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:14,418
Speaker 0: Oh, you know a big.

381
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:15,822
Speaker 0: Oh is about big.

382
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,025
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right big.

383
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:20,132
Speaker 0: Oh, it's showtime Cast.

384
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,000
Speaker 1: in the name of God you not guilty.

385
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,189
Speaker 1: yeah, we have came to team big.

386
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:29,125
Speaker 0: Oh well personally I think that openers have two main purposes.

387
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:32,836
Speaker 0: the first purpose is Sort of a bridge.

388
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:34,946
Speaker 0: you know it makes the prologue possible.

389
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,266
Speaker 0: when you think about it It's like without the openers.

390
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:56,541
Speaker 0: These prologues on anime totally wouldn't work because the prologues do is they kind of lead you into the episode like something something something suspense opener and it's like ah and that suspense carries over the opener and then the episode starts and That to me feels a lot smoother a start to watching a show.

391
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:59,769
Speaker 0: then just opener get right into it.

392
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:01,241
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it also definitely.

393
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:02,230
Speaker 1: I mean say you do that.

394
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,390
Speaker 1: You know you have the regular prologue like it was a sad time.

395
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,284
Speaker 1: And then that thing happened and it fades out and then the show just fades in.

396
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:15,981
Speaker 1: that's a totally different vibe from Blah blah blah and then the opening music fades in.

397
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,127
Speaker 0: yep the other thing.

398
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:22,261
Speaker 0: the main purpose I think of openers is to set the mood for the show.

399
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:29,473
Speaker 0: You know it's like if you're about to watch I don't know like Love Hina.

400
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:34,449
Speaker 0: right the opener is all sort of happy and jumpy and doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

401
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:44,249
Speaker 0: You know that's sort of the mood of the show matches that opener, so you know if you just start watching it It's like you'd have to get into the mood during the show.

402
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:50,398
Speaker 0: You know itself as opposed to you're set in the mood by the opener And then the show starts.

403
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,730
Speaker 0: it gives you the correct feeling Before you know if you don't need to run up while stuff is happening.

404
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,412
Speaker 0: Initial D.

405
00:28:57,432 --> 00:29:00,202
Speaker 1: Definitely did that well definitely put you in this kind of grooving.

406
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:01,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's go mood.

407
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:05,208
Speaker 0: Yep I think that's the purpose of an anime opener now?

408
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,716
Speaker 0: now What about a closer though?

409
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:09,490
Speaker 0: besides of course showing the credits at the credits is obvious?

410
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:13,476
Speaker 0: But you know unless you're someone who reads the credits What is the purpose of a close?

411
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:16,530
Speaker 1: it seems like there are two kinds of shows when it comes to closers and?

412
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,080
Speaker 1: the first kind of the shows that they'll show you like clips from the episode or Really, just kind of nothing.

413
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,570
Speaker 1: It'll be barely anything at all.

414
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:27,689
Speaker 0: I guess the closer does actually let you know the episodes over.

415
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:33,361
Speaker 1: well Maybe it'll be some screenshots from the previous episode Maybe it'll be a series of art shots that aren't in the show.

416
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:42,208
Speaker 1: I remember one particular full metal alchemist closer that was just a Lying back winry being panned over and then various pictures of winry doing things.

417
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:42,649
Speaker 0: yep.

418
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:46,260
Speaker 1: And there are the rare shows that actually have a closer.

419
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:47,704
Speaker 1: That's a lot like the opener.

420
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:54,930
Speaker 1: That's fully animated crazy Well done beautiful whatever and those don't seem to be very common anymore.

421
00:29:55,372 --> 00:29:58,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I don't know some.

422
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:12,116
Speaker 0: I Think one purpose of a closer is that if you're watching shows in marathon I remember at anime club You know I don't do it now, but at anime club We always showed all Openers and closers and marathoning shows.

423
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:16,730
Speaker 1: this seems to be a point of contention in modern anime clubs and among younger anime fans.

424
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:24,430
Speaker 1: I mean in the old days There was this idea that you have to watch every single screen second of every anime.

425
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,800
Speaker 1: I mean when I got a fan sub on a tape it had the opener Then it had the show.

426
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,913
Speaker 1: it had both Eyecatches.

427
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:33,140
Speaker 1: then it had the closing credits and the preview.

428
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:35,146
Speaker 1: at the end of every episode.

429
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:40,862
Speaker 1: it would then show The opener and the closer again without the subtitles or the credit.

430
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:43,289
Speaker 1: so you got the pure version so you could watch that too.

431
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:43,912
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

432
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:48,618
Speaker 0: they seem to have moved that to the extras, but yeah Yeah, I'm talking more about fan subs.

433
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:51,270
Speaker 0: I remember the first time I saw anime at anime club.

434
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,264
Speaker 0: It was so weird because okay.

435
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,050
Speaker 0: We watch the opener.

436
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,074
Speaker 0: I know what an opener is.

437
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,479
Speaker 0: that makes sense you know.

438
00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:59,340
Speaker 0: and Then they'll be the eye catches and like what the hell.

439
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,670
Speaker 0: and then at the end of the episode that'd be the closer.

440
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:04,640
Speaker 0: Then they would show the preview for the next episode.

441
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:07,510
Speaker 0: then they would show the opener that you know again.

442
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:10,249
Speaker 0: So it's like if I watched four episodes of a show.

443
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:20,050
Speaker 0: I saw the opener four times in the closer four times and two of the times the opener had the English Subtitles and two of the times the opener had the Japanese subtitles, and it was it's like whoa.

444
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:25,230
Speaker 0: Why don't we just watch what the opener once at the beginning and once at the end and the four episodes in the middle?

445
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,821
Speaker 0: But yet, why do we have those eye catches there?

446
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:28,605
Speaker 0: Do we really need those?

447
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:29,690
Speaker 1: we were kind of the bridge?

448
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,082
Speaker 1: I mean it seems like the people just slightly more.

449
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:33,369
Speaker 0: that was my thoughts originally.

450
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:35,135
Speaker 0: now I sometimes I like to watch the open.

451
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:44,010
Speaker 1: well honestly because I've been watching fan subs mostly Sailor Moon and Ava just whatever crap I Could get a hold of back then and I always watched every single thing on those tapes.

452
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,917
Speaker 1: I think part of it was that they were hard to get.

453
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,910
Speaker 1: so if you got an anime it felt so special especially if it Was something that wasn't just available in the u.s.

454
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:58,387
Speaker 1: And you felt like it was your duty to get all your money's worth out of it And I would watch the textless opener and closer just marvel at them.

455
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:02,482
Speaker 1: well And I think that's just from a bygone culture of anime.

456
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:04,068
Speaker 1: is this rare and difficult to get thing?

457
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:08,984
Speaker 1: and when you get it It's like a museum piece like ooh look how the openers animated.

458
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:14,268
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to see it without all those Characters in the way without all that text blocking that art.

459
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:24,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then all the younger kids in anime Club as we were getting older and getting closer to graduation would kick Constantly ask why are we watching the closer over and over again?

460
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,606
Speaker 1: I want to finish the show so I can get to tape checkout.

461
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:39,030
Speaker 0: yeah now I do kind of think that when watching a show in Marathon form you know episode after episode that the closers do actually provide sort of this nice transition between episodes of you know feeling.

462
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:49,870
Speaker 0: I mean if you were just stayed in the moat in the mood for the show throughout 26 straight episodes without you know the closer to kind of bring you down and then the opener to bring you back in.

463
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,908
Speaker 0: That can seriously fuck you up with some shows.

464
00:32:52,928 --> 00:33:01,829
Speaker 1: well Especially we used to do this a lot when we were in college where we'd pick a weekend We'd get a 26 episode show and we'd marathon the thing pretty much in one day.

465
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,779
Speaker 1: Yep, now it seemed like the best way to handle it.

466
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,807
Speaker 1: least the way that I liked was we'd watch the opener about half the Time like sometimes we'd watch the opener.

467
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:15,387
Speaker 1: sometimes We'd skip it But we always watch the closer just at the end of whatever tape.

468
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:23,191
Speaker 1: we were watching Mm-hmm, and then between tapes we had kind of this wind down period where we'd all just kind of sit there all Wistful.

469
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:30,090
Speaker 1: yeah of course that might have been due to the fact that we were usually watching heavy-duty anime and not so much over long periods of time without rest.

470
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,103
Speaker 1: I mean what we mostly marathon things like Ava and Eska and utenna.

471
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:36,130
Speaker 1: we didn't really marathon anything funny.

472
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:40,530
Speaker 0: Nope all right, so we know why openers and closers are important.

473
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:44,150
Speaker 0: Oh, they're also important to market new hit music at least in Japan.

474
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:48,250
Speaker 0: They don't seem to do that in America so much at least I don't watch TV anymore.

475
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:56,210
Speaker 0: Maybe they started doing it But in Japan they always put hit music on like the big anime as the openers and closers so they can sell that music.

476
00:33:56,391 --> 00:34:00,805
Speaker 0: Well also a lot of Gundam seed sold a lot of records for TMR.

477
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:02,330
Speaker 0: Let me tell you they also.

478
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,198
Speaker 1: Not so much now, but especially back in the day.

479
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,469
Speaker 1: the opener itself was basically a trailer for the show.

480
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:23,956
Speaker 1: I mean before you could get digi subs or anything the thing that the commodity that was traded online were often just openers to shows You've never heard of and in fact I remember when I saw the opener to Eska flown a long before I had any way of getting Eska flown a and that got Me so hooked and pumped about that show.

481
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:28,650
Speaker 0: yeah, that is true all right, so we know why openers and closers exist.

482
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:32,310
Speaker 0: What makes a good opener as opposed to a bad?

483
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,594
Speaker 0: Opener and the same for clothes?

484
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,743
Speaker 1: there's a lot of different kinds of openers and closers.

485
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:44,089
Speaker 1: I mean they range from the Generic animation made to be an opener along with whatever kind of music is popular in Japan at the time.

486
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:58,589
Speaker 1: There's the ones that try to be like they'll have a song that's written for the show that Really fits or kind of reveals things about the show set to an opener that reveals things about the show or Shows you footage from the show that you haven't seen yet.

487
00:34:59,273 --> 00:35:13,929
Speaker 1: I guess like an example of the former would be all of the Fullmetal Alchemist openers There were really just kind of popular j-rock song with cool imagery Yep as opposed to say Evangelion where the show's opener was actually pretty relevant to the show in terms of the music.

488
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:22,869
Speaker 1: and If you pay attention to the opener it Reveals a lot in really obtuse ways and definitely sets up that this is not the kind of show you think it is.

489
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:25,827
Speaker 0: Oh wow the Ava opener is just kind of crazy.

490
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:26,330
Speaker 0: it out there.

491
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when we were first watching Ava.

492
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:37,106
Speaker 1: We actually slowed it down and tried to look at all the frames in the opener and tried to figure out what was going on And some of that stuff was disturbing especially when you didn't know where the show was going.

493
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:40,157
Speaker 0: oh, man Yeah, another good example.

494
00:35:40,177 --> 00:35:40,538
Speaker 0: Well.

495
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:40,919
Speaker 0: I don't know.

496
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,127
Speaker 0: a related example is the antenna opener with the horses.

497
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:47,776
Speaker 1: Oh god We knew this guy Dwayne I think we've talked about Dwayne off and on.

498
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:53,074
Speaker 1: Dwayne is a bigger utenna fan than either of us, and that's saying a lot Now.

499
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,661
Speaker 1: he had seen all of utenna before.

500
00:35:54,781 --> 00:36:23,470
Speaker 1: I had seen more than two episodes of it And I remember one day he was talking to me wall stone And he hadn't seen the end yet like he'd seen everything, but the last two episodes, and he tells me between puffs on his joint That he knows what's gonna happen because every scene from the opener happened in the show Except for the last one which shows two characters on horses in armor flying toward a castle And he was so sure that that was gonna be in the show because everything else was in the show.

501
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:31,250
Speaker 1: Not gonna ruin whether or not it was in the show, but I think you can guess yep All right, so what do I think makes a good opener?

502
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:36,550
Speaker 0: Well actually personally I think that the music is more important than the animation in the opener.

503
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:55,149
Speaker 0: Not that animation is not important in the opener But basically you can have a decent opener if the music sets the right mood and the animation is kind of cheap as It's not you know Non-existent, but you can't have a good opener with bad music even if your animation is amazing

504
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,258
Speaker 1: course But you do

505
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,262
Speaker 0: something really artistic and you're all like a silent opener or something like that.

506
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:07,870
Speaker 1: good and bad music is really subjective because Especially since openers more and more now are whatever music's popular at the time so a lot of older anime.

507
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:15,922
Speaker 0: It's not so much whether the music is good or bad as if you like the song It's so much that does the music match the mood of the show.

508
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,074
Speaker 1: well look back like look back in the day Tank police.

509
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:28,810
Speaker 1: the opener in Japan is this Totally generic ladies pops 80s j-pop song and it's like hot dance and cherry moon hot dance.

510
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:31,618
Speaker 1: It has so little to do with the show.

511
00:37:31,638 --> 00:37:36,292
Speaker 1: it doesn't mean it's even worse in terms of relevance than Fullmetal Alchemist Openers.

512
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:42,377
Speaker 1: and yet the opener itself the way it's animated is super awesome And it's alright.

513
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:42,780
Speaker 1: It's alright.

514
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:42,941
Speaker 1: Well.

515
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:44,230
Speaker 1: This might be a kind of the greatest.

516
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:48,069
Speaker 0: It's a lot of panning over stills as opposed to animation.

517
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:58,045
Speaker 1: well It's also a lot of big o style a bunch of tanks a bigger set of tanks a bigger set of tanks Kind of tanks, but my controversial opinion.

518
00:37:58,105 --> 00:37:59,350
Speaker 1: Is that the redubbed?

519
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,100
Speaker 1: re-musicked American opener is Vastly superior to the Japanese opener.

520
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:07,810
Speaker 0: I don't know it wasn't on the DVD, so I can't really comment.

521
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,283
Speaker 0: I don't remember it from back in the day so much.

522
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:11,550
Speaker 0: basically remember a little bit.

523
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:19,838
Speaker 1: They wrote a song that fits exactly with what's going on in the opening animation And it enhances it and makes it an awesome opener.

524
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:30,567
Speaker 1: where the Japanese opener which has the same great funny relative to the time animation Totally doesn't set the mood of the show at all because it has this completely irrelevant song attached to it mm-hmm.

525
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:34,426
Speaker 0: now What makes a good closer see I used to think that a?

526
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:43,730
Speaker 0: Closer would be good if it took you from the mood of the show Back to like you know a neutral mood that you could live with in the everyday world.

527
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:48,172
Speaker 1: I can name two shows that have really good openers, and I have a very specific reason Why.

528
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:51,990
Speaker 1: yeah for Shiggy Yugi the first season which actually I really like that.

529
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,126
Speaker 0: I don't I've never saw the opener, but I think I'd know the song if you played it.

530
00:38:55,146 --> 00:39:08,619
Speaker 1: Yeah on the closer Yeah, oh the closing and Nana.

531
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,920
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

532
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Speaker 1: now The reason I say these two is that both of them the shows use the closer in a very specific way.

533
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:25,060
Speaker 1: The end of every episode would usually build to some sort of cliffhanger Climax or stopping point one of those three in every single episode.

534
00:39:25,422 --> 00:39:27,959
Speaker 1: but when I was a stopping point like a big stopping point and

535
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:28,861
Speaker 0: even

536
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:39,539
Speaker 1: when there was a stopping point that always leave you kind of hanging like just barely over the edge of a cliffhanger and You'd know when the end of the show was coming up because they'd slowly pan in the closers.

537
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,346
Speaker 0: music Did that also.

538
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:51,240
Speaker 0: that is that is one of the best things ever is when animes Start playing the closing music like 10 15 seconds before the end of the show.

539
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:53,247
Speaker 0: They did.

540
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:56,780
Speaker 0: a lot of shows are doing that now and even though a lot of people are doing it.

541
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,379
Speaker 0: It's good to keep doing it.

542
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:08,600
Speaker 1: There's no reason that most shows shouldn't be doing that because I'm not sure why but I guess it keeps the level of the like The energy of the show up and it pulls you out of the show into the real world.

543
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:15,579
Speaker 1: But yet you don't get that sense of alright, I'm done you get that sense of something's happening and I gotta see it.

544
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:19,753
Speaker 0: Yep, another a good example of a recent closer.

545
00:40:19,774 --> 00:40:20,416
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

546
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:21,680
Speaker 0: is the gun could sue a closer?

547
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:27,594
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah See now it's weird that one because the music doesn't start until the closer starts.

548
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:40,744
Speaker 0: if the closer just kind of jumps out at you It's like, you know You know and the closer doesn't have much animation - it's just mostly credits But you know what?

549
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:41,427
Speaker 1: It doesn't need it.

550
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:44,200
Speaker 0: It doesn't need it cuz that song is so powerful.

551
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:51,040
Speaker 1: God, I mean the lyrics to that song are probably the closest fitting closer lyrics to any anime ever.

552
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:52,344
Speaker 0: I just I don't know.

553
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:54,010
Speaker 0: I just love that so much.

554
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:58,607
Speaker 1: I don't know why it seems like the hard-hitting closers Regardless of how they're animated.

555
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:01,380
Speaker 1: just the use of music is more important than the use of animation.

556
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,435
Speaker 0: And in fact, yeah, you know, actually there's a lot of shows that like.

557
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:11,659
Speaker 0: I like the show a lot But the closers are just kind of like and and and and and and and and and it's the end of the show.

558
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:24,174
Speaker 1: Like one or two still shots kind of slowly move from the bottom of the top like on the side or like a Naked ray spinning in front of the moonlight while someone sings fly me to the moon.

559
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,418
Speaker 0: Yeah, like let's see.

560
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,153
Speaker 0: Yeah Evangelion closer and not so exciting really.

561
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:29,676
Speaker 0: I don't know.

562
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:30,440
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan.

563
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:33,759
Speaker 0: What else doesn't have the greatest closer?

564
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,651
Speaker 0: Cromartie high school not the greatest closer yet now.

565
00:41:36,672 --> 00:41:38,420
Speaker 1: now Gog mong of yori.

566
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:41,776
Speaker 0: I was just gonna say Gog mong of yori cuz I had it in my mind.

567
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:42,540
Speaker 0: you beat me to it.

568
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,427
Speaker 0: That's the same moment.

569
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:45,040
Speaker 1: That is another hard-hitting.

570
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:53,149
Speaker 1: I don't think I need to play that one.

571
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:55,393
Speaker 1: No Yeah, it seems.

572
00:41:55,473 --> 00:42:06,130
Speaker 1: but it seems like a lot of shows until very recently had just totally lame closers that you just immediately changed the Channel and I think part of the rationale for having these new closers might not be entirely artistic.

573
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:21,530
Speaker 1: I'll bet the networks in Japan have something to do with it because if the closer is just like a stopping point like fade out With credits going by That's a real great time for someone to turn off the TV and go have a real life somewhere.

574
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:30,046
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, if the closer hits you hard full energy and keeps you pumped up You're gonna sit there to the end of the closer and then a new show is gonna come on.

575
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:38,967
Speaker 0: Mmm Yeah, you know actually in the United States It doesn't seem like clothes like every show has a closer I guess but it seems like a lot of shows will.

576
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:46,250
Speaker 0: just you know They just break the screen in half They start running ads immediately on the other half of the use to do that and the credits just kind of flow.

577
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,238
Speaker 1: That's a new by new God.

578
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:50,768
Speaker 1: That's a new development as in I don't know 15 years ago.

579
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:56,210
Speaker 1: Yeah But in America, it seems like openers and closers just don't matter anymore at all.

580
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,736
Speaker 1: I mean the average show is like a.

581
00:42:57,777 --> 00:43:00,227
Speaker 0: well, I think that this the cartoons still have.

582
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:05,704
Speaker 0: the openers Yeah, but actual TV that normal people actual live-action TV in the u.s.

583
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:06,747
Speaker 0: They don't seem to.

584
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:10,102
Speaker 0: they seem to these really Short meaningless openers.

585
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:11,570
Speaker 0: I haven't watched TV recently.

586
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:20,565
Speaker 1: Every drama show is like Don't And like shots of the people standing there like I am the serious guy.

587
00:43:20,926 --> 00:43:21,830
Speaker 1: I'm a guy with a gun.

588
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:22,472
Speaker 1: Look at us.

589
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:24,559
Speaker 1: run past this car that's about to explode.

590
00:43:24,941 --> 00:43:27,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean look at like The Simpsons has an opener, right?

591
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,350
Speaker 0: That's there's a freaking opener.

592
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:30,052
Speaker 1: Yeah But you know what?

593
00:43:30,654 --> 00:43:36,759
Speaker 1: as soon as Simpsons goes into reruns at least as long as I watch TV if you watch a Simpsons on Sunday night you get the full opener.

594
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:50,369
Speaker 0: if you watch a rerun or a syndicated Simpsons episode in another episode on another channel or during the week it has the shortened opener and The closer to the Simpsons is just doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and the credits there's nothing to it.

595
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,590
Speaker 1: Well, the other thing I always noticed that in America closers have the an open.

596
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,020
Speaker 1: You know the Futurama the same thing.

597
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:56,390
Speaker 0: big opener no closer.

598
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:59,362
Speaker 1: Well closers and openers have the same production values as a show.

599
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:06,545
Speaker 1: but in Japan a lot of anime Especially older anime seem to put so much money and effort into the opener and closer.

600
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:11,017
Speaker 1: I put forth Sailor Moon Especially the later seasons of Sailor Moon.

601
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:16,853
Speaker 1: the animation in the openers and closers was beautiful and Phenomenal.

602
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:24,078
Speaker 0: and well, I think it's when you know that that opener is gonna be played so many times You put a lot more effort into it.

603
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:27,110
Speaker 0: when you're making animation that's gonna be shown in one episode.

604
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,930
Speaker 0: You know, you're not gonna put as much money into it as you are something that's gonna reappear constantly.

605
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's kind of like the Gonzo effect only applied to an individual episode.

606
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,577
Speaker 0: It's like we're if we make a mistake here.

607
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:41,384
Speaker 0: People are gonna see that mistake every week.

608
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:42,589
Speaker 0: We can't make a mistake here.

609
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:47,069
Speaker 1: You know the problem with this was that Sailor Moon beautiful beautiful opener and closer, right?

610
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,850
Speaker 1: Then you're watching the show and it's just the only runs of the opener and the closer and especially in the middle.

611
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:58,187
Speaker 1: I don't know Sailor Stars where they started hiring scab artists because they were running out of money.

612
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,170
Speaker 1: and it's just.

613
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:01,539
Speaker 1: It's like a different show comes on.

614
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,940
Speaker 1: Yep, utenna same kind of thing almost Yeah, actually has a really beautiful opener compared to the show.

615
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,430
Speaker 0: this it does with this one utenna closer, that's awesome.

616
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:11,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, which one is it?

617
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,190
Speaker 0: It's the one where it's like white and there's a rectangle.

618
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:31,950
Speaker 0: So let's move on to the final bit about openers and closers.

619
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:35,540
Speaker 0: What are the bests and the worsts?

620
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,909
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what you're going after.

621
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:39,638
Speaker 0: I mean, I really like your favorites there.

622
00:45:39,658 --> 00:45:43,530
Speaker 1: Whatever Well, see I really like the Fullmetal Alchemist openers and the Gundam seed.

623
00:45:44,051 --> 00:45:53,775
Speaker 0: I really like the Gundam seed openers a lot And the Gundam seed closers, I don't think are as great But the way they pull the music in at the end of the episode is high quality.

624
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:58,397
Speaker 1: with the Gundam seed openers A lot of openers like to have information about the show.

625
00:45:58,437 --> 00:46:01,200
Speaker 0: That is true But I do not like about them in there subtly.

626
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:03,026
Speaker 1: The problem is Gundam seed.

627
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:08,283
Speaker 1: if you are at least of average intelligence the openers and closers reveal to you.

628
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:18,220
Speaker 0: you have to purposefully maintain and give yourself doubt in order to Disbelieve the information the openers are giving you even though all of it is true.

629
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,792
Speaker 1: Scott had already seen the show and I had.

630
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,766
Speaker 1: while we were watching it I picked out.

631
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:37,020
Speaker 0: exactly like every single Romantics twist every single change of allegiance is based solely on the openers and closers and when I watched the show originally I saw the same things that rim did in the openers and closers, but I chose to maintain doubt about them.

632
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,250
Speaker 0: I would tell myself it's just the opener.

633
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,856
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean it's gonna turn out that way.

634
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:43,191
Speaker 0: It's just the opener It's gonna turn out that way.

635
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:44,380
Speaker 0: and then it did anyway.

636
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,440
Speaker 0: But I was able to purposefully maintain doubt for my own sanity.

637
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:49,423
Speaker 1: See I just knew.

638
00:46:49,463 --> 00:46:54,860
Speaker 1: the only thing I didn't predict in that show was the thing that wasn't in the openers and closers at all.

639
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:59,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing that could not be predicted of course because it was kind of chintzy.

640
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:00,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, just a little.

641
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,980
Speaker 1: yeah It was a little too convenient anyway.

642
00:47:03,582 --> 00:47:04,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

643
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:10,944
Speaker 1: my favorite opener is probably a cross between utenna just because the utenna opener There's a lot to it.

644
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:11,667
Speaker 1: Just like the show.

645
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:12,592
Speaker 1: There's a lot to it.

646
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:17,859
Speaker 1: all the Sailor Moon openers Just cuz they're really really pretty and because there's a lot of nostalgia for them.

647
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:25,540
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I don't know it's hard to say I would say the best opener ever is I don't know if I could argue against it is cowboy bebop.

648
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:35,919
Speaker 1: Cowboy bebop is very special because it has an opener that really Nails home the idea that cowboy bebop is a show unlike other shows.

649
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:37,506
Speaker 1: That is kind of this news.

650
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:40,960
Speaker 0: closer is kind of a. it basically has no animation whatsoever.

651
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,987
Speaker 0: It's just the credits scrolling over.

652
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,820
Speaker 0: You know a picture, but no it's the song is pretty awesome.

653
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,187
Speaker 1: It's the credit scrolling over fairly relevant pictures.

654
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:53,240
Speaker 0: Yes, but it's just a still picture, but the music in the closer is very good.

655
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:54,734
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's part of it.

656
00:47:54,976 --> 00:48:03,552
Speaker 1: generally I can watch the opener to a show every time I watch the show even if I'm marathoning it mm-hmm But generally I can't watch a closer more than once and I only look at.

657
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:07,468
Speaker 0: I can watch the konkotsuo closer every time Yeah, but most closers.

658
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:09,962
Speaker 0: after I see those closers after I see them once I can't watch.

659
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:12,852
Speaker 1: all I do is check periodically to see if the closer change.

660
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:16,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's some openers like Gundam seed like.

661
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,030
Speaker 0: the openers are good.

662
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,515
Speaker 0: I could watch them a bunch of times.

663
00:48:19,615 --> 00:48:20,759
Speaker 0: I couldn't watch them 50 times.

664
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,979
Speaker 0: It's a 50-something episode show, but the fact that they changed the opener okay.

665
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:28,720
Speaker 0: now I can watch every opener because they change it often enough throughout the show.

666
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,380
Speaker 0: This is what like four or five different openings, so it's still cool.

667
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:35,479
Speaker 0: What other openers are really damn good.

668
00:48:36,861 --> 00:48:42,420
Speaker 0: See the try gun opener has that really perfect awesome music, but the animation is nothing to it.

669
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,629
Speaker 0: It's just still pictures.

670
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:44,637
Speaker 1: try gun opener is garb.

671
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:45,000
Speaker 1: of course.

672
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:53,180
Speaker 1: They particularly gimped the opener of try gun in the u.s.. You see the opener changes Episode to episode based on what goes on in the episode and then the u.s.

673
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,121
Speaker 1: Release.

674
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:59,259
Speaker 1: they just pretended it didn't do that or maybe they didn't realize it And they just took the one from the first episode and used it for the whole show.

675
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:05,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's definitely like the opener is just a bunch of pictures and the camera pans over these still frames.

676
00:49:05,802 --> 00:49:12,708
Speaker 0: but there's one still frame that's relevant to the episode you're about to watch and It's always a frame.

677
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,714
Speaker 0: That's relevant to the first episode.

678
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:24,610
Speaker 0: so I must assume I don't know if it's a hundred percent true that in Japan that if you watched it on TV That it was a different still frame every opener.

679
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:25,312
Speaker 1: It was.

680
00:49:25,392 --> 00:49:26,977
Speaker 1: I saw some fansubs that showed me that.

681
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:27,860
Speaker 0: oh did you alright?

682
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,240
Speaker 0: Well in the u.s.. It was just the opener for the first episode every time.

683
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:34,969
Speaker 1: Also in terms of changing openers.

684
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:45,544
Speaker 1: There's one show that the opener wasn't great Other than the fact that it set the mood for the show really well, but in gassaraki They did something interesting, and I guess I'll say it's one of my favorites Just because I thought it was really cool.

685
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:47,529
Speaker 1: the opener was modular.

686
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:57,077
Speaker 1: it effectively consisted of a whole bunch of fairly short Animated bits that were all kind of strung together in this like vague generic opener thing.

687
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,038
Speaker 1: that kind of told you What was going on in the show?

688
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:17,199
Speaker 1: Every episode or every couple episodes They would move around a couple of them or replace one or two of them and as you watch the show eventually the opener is totally replaced with completely different footage And if you pay attention to that it kind of enhances your understanding of what's going on in the show.

689
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:17,942
Speaker 0: Mmm.

690
00:50:18,203 --> 00:50:20,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, the gassaraki opener is very good at that.

691
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,456
Speaker 1: I really like the song too.

692
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:22,500
Speaker 0: It's an okay song.

693
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:23,504
Speaker 0: I'm just.

694
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:27,280
Speaker 0: I'm actually not the biggest fan of a lot of some of the gassaraki music.

695
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,547
Speaker 0: It's really like half the songs.

696
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:29,452
Speaker 0: I love them in half of them.

697
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:30,920
Speaker 0: I'm like this crap.

698
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:32,989
Speaker 1: I really like the music in gassaraki.

699
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:34,074
Speaker 0: some of its good some is not.

700
00:50:34,716 --> 00:50:42,230
Speaker 0: oh both standalone complexes of awesome openers and well particularly the music is fantastic.

701
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:19,380
Speaker 0: I Don't know what it is about people singing in that language But it's because you can't understand the words so you don't realize that lyrics are stupid.

702
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:25,785
Speaker 1: well, that's not just that cuz I don't understand Japanese very well if at all either but Because it's a language.

703
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:29,019
Speaker 1: I don't hear all the time like Japanese sounded exotic and cool to me.

704
00:51:29,442 --> 00:51:30,690
Speaker 1: I don't know 12 15 years ago now.

705
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,580
Speaker 1: Japanese while I don't understand it doesn't sound special at all.

706
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,925
Speaker 1: It sounds like English to me except.

707
00:51:37,005 --> 00:51:38,611
Speaker 1: I realize halfway through a conversation.

708
00:51:38,631 --> 00:51:39,796
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

709
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:40,679
Speaker 1: I don't understand it.

710
00:51:41,021 --> 00:51:42,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just reading subtitles.

711
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:49,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if I'm watching anime, and it's not subtitled I won't notice right away until I realize they have no idea what someone just said.

712
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:51,571
Speaker 1: yep But I just totally don't even notice.

713
00:51:51,632 --> 00:51:52,559
Speaker 0: like it totally gets me.

714
00:51:52,700 --> 00:52:05,260
Speaker 0: I'll watch a subtitled show and I'll think the people are speaking in English like this the combination of the words and In text on the screen and people making Japanese noises sort of my brain turns it Japanese noise.

715
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:11,820
Speaker 0: My brain takes those two things adds them up, and I hear that character speaking in English sort of in my brain.

716
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,380
Speaker 0: It's kind of crazy Yeah.

717
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:22,638
Speaker 1: But when it happens if you watch a lot of subtitled anime any like any language that I don't have any familiarity with at all especially when it's being sung tends to just sound awesome to me.

718
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:27,200
Speaker 1: and Aside from that the animation even that the weird CG in the first.

719
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:36,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the seed the first opener is cool, but the only thing wrong with it Is that the CG is a little subpar, but it's not initial d-bad It's another unpopular or controversial opinion.

720
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,613
Speaker 1: But I actually really like the way that CG played out in that.

721
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:44,206
Speaker 0: oh I do except for a few Specific things that you can.

722
00:52:44,226 --> 00:52:45,591
Speaker 0: I know you're not like sore thumb.

723
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:47,216
Speaker 1: You're gonna say the majors teeth.

724
00:52:47,257 --> 00:52:49,043
Speaker 0: That's right the teeth They're just in.

725
00:52:49,224 --> 00:52:51,272
Speaker 0: you know what they just stick out so badly.

726
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:53,240
Speaker 1: they didn't stick out to me as being weird.

727
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,928
Speaker 1: They sticked out to sticked out.

728
00:52:54,948 --> 00:53:02,420
Speaker 1: They stuck out to me as being oddly Realistic and I thought no I don't think they were in the uncanny valley for me.

729
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,790
Speaker 0: I definitely got a. those are just not even you know.

730
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:12,153
Speaker 0: they really bothered me not because they were too real But because they were poorly rendered.

731
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:13,197
Speaker 1: I don't think they were that bad.

732
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:13,800
Speaker 1: I thought it was cool.

733
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,045
Speaker 0: I think they looked kind of weird.

734
00:53:15,246 --> 00:53:17,877
Speaker 1: my favorite part in that opener is still the bit with the Tachi Koma.

735
00:53:17,937 --> 00:53:20,714
Speaker 0: of course Tachi Komas are always the master which is why he goes in the shells.

736
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:21,479
Speaker 0: awesome closers.

737
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:28,788
Speaker 0: It's just Tachi Koma Tachi Koma, and then at the last second they go to do to do to do to do And that's it.

738
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,737
Speaker 0: There's no real closer on.

739
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:31,220
Speaker 0: it is there.

740
00:53:31,721 --> 00:53:37,358
Speaker 1: I guess I could give an honorable mention definitely to tenku no eska flown a because that opener is one of those.

741
00:53:37,378 --> 00:53:38,180
Speaker 1: the openers.

742
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:45,197
Speaker 1: That's just so perfectly describes Everything about that show in terms of style and mood and theme.

743
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:47,885
Speaker 1: you watch that opener And you know exactly what you're gonna get.

744
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:53,238
Speaker 0: I want to give an honorable mention to both openers for ko century beast.

00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:42,193

761
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,604
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be worth the whole.

762
00:55:57,624 --> 00:55:59,190

778
00:56:39,171 --> 00:56:40,439
Speaker 1: they all seem to work well enough.

779
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:47,080

Speaker 1: See I totally forgotten about that.

781
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:52,699
