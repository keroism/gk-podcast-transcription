1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,139
Speaker 1: It's Monday, February 1st, 2021.

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:10,300
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:13,985
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,615
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:19,630
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about the environmental costs of computing.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,848
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,750
Speaker 1: So, uh, there was a distant time, I want to take you back to when I was in, like, third grade.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,770
Speaker 1: And I'd wake up in the morning, and, like, my parents were up and buzzing more than usual, and they'd have their radio on.

9
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:41,950
Speaker 1: And that was a very important signal, because that meant that they were listening to see if we were going to have a snow day.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,997
Speaker 1: There was no way to look that up in the old days.

11
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,090
Speaker 1: You would just wake up, and a radio station would say a list of schools that were closed.

12
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:57,490
Speaker 1: I don't think kids will understand those episodes of The Simpsons in a not-too-distant future.

13
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:05,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it was this one radio station that had it that was the best at doing that, and there were other stations that did it.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,310
Speaker 0: Like, you could also, I think eventually, the TV also did it with a scroll at the bottom.

15
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:14,010
Speaker 0: At some point, they added that graphic in, like, you know, the late '90s, I guess.

16
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:19,410
Speaker 0: But yeah, there's this one radio station I would never listen to, except for that situation.

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:26,570
Speaker 0: And if I knew there was snow action, I would basically wake up, stay in bed, and I had the clock radio.

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,189
Speaker 0: And that's the only time I would use the radio function on it.

19
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,941
Speaker 1: You hear that radio on in every room of the house.

20
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,190
Speaker 1: My parents were listening downstairs, my brother was listening in his room.

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,899
Speaker 0: So it was on that station, and only that station.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,950
Speaker 0: And usually, I would be, like, maybe the first one to return, right?

23
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:51,330
Speaker 0: And I would turn it on, the lowest volume, so no one could hear, and they would just say the list of all the schools, the towns in the area, in alphabetical order, and being in Trumbull.

24
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,192
Speaker 0: Everybody's jealous.

25
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,017
Speaker 0: The kids in Ansonia, they know right away.

26
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:56,343
Speaker 0: It's like, Ansonia.

27
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,667
Speaker 0: It's like, uh-huh, right?

28
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:58,910
Speaker 0: You don't gotta wait for shit.

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,810
Speaker 1: Those poor kids, this is a quick.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,836
Speaker 0: Right, but you're in Trumbull.

31
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,529
Speaker 0: It's like you're waiting, and they're like, you know, Easton.

32
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:13,050
Speaker 1: We had two schools that had very similar names to our school, and they had way more snow days than us.

33
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,796
Speaker 0: Oh, they actually said the names of the schools.

34
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:18,890
Speaker 0: For us, it would be the names of the towns, because every town would just close in time.

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:27,910
Speaker 1: See, I lived in such a dense, well, I lived in Detroit, and then later we lived in the dense suburbs of Detroit, so they had to go by school district, and sometimes individual schools.

36
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,690
Speaker 1: Like, there were four school districts in our, like, neighborhood.

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:40,350
Speaker 0: Oh, these radio stations would just be covering, like, half of Connecticut, so they would just be naming every single town in, you know, right?

38
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,063
Speaker 0: And then I guess they also did some private schools.

39
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:42,828
Speaker 0: They'd be like, you know.

40
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,730
Speaker 1: They would go by, ours would go by, like, the county.

41
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:47,429
Speaker 0: No.

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,679
Speaker 1: But that was huge, so it was, like, it was an ordeal.

43
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,950
Speaker 1: Like, you had to find, like, the right radio station to get the news.

44
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,690
Speaker 1: There was also a hotline you could call, but it was always just busy, so there was no point.

45
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,229
Speaker 1: I feel like they just had one modem.

46
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,170
Speaker 0: Fairfield County has 23 towns in it, so.

47
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:15,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were multiple schools that might- And they were definitely covering more than this, at least the ones I see here, because they definitely mentioned towns that were not on this list, so.

48
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:25,690
Speaker 1: But we're in this weird situation where, like, even as an adult, like, one, as a kid, when I got older, schools definitely canceled school less readily for a lot of reasons.

49
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,050
Speaker 1: Like, there were just fewer snow days.

50
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:39,230
Speaker 1: But two, as an adult, I've noticed that, you know, I don't often get snow days, but even I would occasionally, like, even living in New York, get a snow day every now and then.

51
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:45,150
Speaker 1: Except now, with COVID and everyone easily able to work from home, don't really get snow days anymore.

52
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:52,746
Speaker 0: I can't honestly say whether snow days have increased or decreased, or if they've been more or less trigger-happy over time.

53
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:54,450
Speaker 0: I need to see data to know for sure.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,539
Speaker 1: This is definitely kid brain bias, but I'm confident.

55
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,610
Speaker 1: second grade made way more snow days than, like, seventh grade.

56
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:10,362
Speaker 0: But, like, my feeling is that they, it's like, my feelings tell me both answers are correct.

57
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:14,730
Speaker 0: Like, oh, you know, it's like, yeah, they do, they make you go to school now more.

58
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,470
Speaker 0: But also my feeling says, yeah, they're too safety-minded to do, you know, more snow days.

59
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:26,530
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I don't know if they're actually more or less, and my brain just feels like both things are true at the same time.

60
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:33,443
Speaker 1: There's another factor that the science of, like, getting snow off roads got better.

61
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,710
Speaker 1: Like, the operation of, like, how they do it got better in a lot of places.

62
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,670
Speaker 0: Climate change, at least somewhat recently, there's less snow.

63
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,535
Speaker 1: Yep, there's also just less snow.

64
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:48,150
Speaker 1: Like, as a kid, a foot of snow would happen multiple times a year in Michigan.

65
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,350
Speaker 1: And even as, like, by the time I was in high school, that happened maybe once in the entire four years I was in high school.

66
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:57,569
Speaker 0: Hmm, I don't know.

67
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:05,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I just, I saw a ton of kids on Twitter, like, I bumped into this, like, cluster of communication.

68
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:18,368
Speaker 1: And it was a bunch of kids kind of very rightly realizing that the concept of a snow day was probably killed by COVID, because the remote infrastructure that was set up will mean that schools will never bother with that again.

69
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:19,050
Speaker 1: They'll just make them.

70
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,054
Speaker 1: I don't know.

71
00:05:20,074 --> 00:05:27,430
Speaker 0: New York is closing school tomorrow, even though I think it was technically remote learning today, but I'm telling you, I guarantee no remote learning happened today, right?

72
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,096
Speaker 0: There's no way.

73
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:32,250
Speaker 0: It was definitely snow day today, for sure.

74
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,270
Speaker 1: I just worry, I think we're gonna see a future where snow days literally don't happen at some point, like, ever.

75
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,970
Speaker 0: I think they'll definitely go down because of climate change and the remoteness and whatever, but I think there will still be some amount of snow day.

76
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:48,652
Speaker 1: I don't know.

77
00:05:48,712 --> 00:06:00,610
Speaker 1: I think the main reason there won't be, like, my guess, again, I might be wrong, is that remote learning will be such that schools will just, they'll get up in the morning and they'll announce, like, remote learning today because of inclement weather.

78
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,378
Speaker 0: We'll see.

79
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:03,270
Speaker 0: We'll see.

80
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, we will see.

81
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:05,636
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's Monday.

82
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,945
Speaker 1: It's not time for a Tech News Roundup.

83
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,248
Speaker 1: We actually have some show topics.

84
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:10,870
Speaker 1: Like, what's going on?

85
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,681
Speaker 0: You got another month.

86
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,503
Speaker 1: I get to do that once a year.

87
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,246
Speaker 1: I gotta save it up.

88
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:17,970
Speaker 1: I gotta treasure it.

89
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,020
Speaker 0: Alright, so this is a tiny news and it's game and tech related, right?

90
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:25,010
Speaker 0: So we all know that Nintendo's online multiplayer is trash.

91
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,006
Speaker 0: For a lot of reasons.

92
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,977
Speaker 0: It was trash on the Wii, right?

93
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,863
Speaker 0: And the GameCube barely had any.

94
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,990
Speaker 0: So the Wii is really where it started and it was trash.

95
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:40,345
Speaker 0: And then it really, they sort of really ramped it up on the Wii U and 3DS, right?

96
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,890
Speaker 0: But that was also trash.

97
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,210
Speaker 0: And, of course, they have it on Switch.

98
00:06:44,750 --> 00:07:00,890
Speaker 0: Well, apparently, the news has come out that the server side system that they use for their multiplayer was created by a company called Quizal and was called Rendezvous that Ubisoft bought in 2010.

99
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,749
Speaker 0: Nintendo licensed it and renamed it NEX, N-E-X.

100
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:14,550
Speaker 0: And Nintendo has been using NEX for its multiplayer system since, like, 18, it's like super old, right?

101
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:18,164
Speaker 0: They've been using it for like 18 years old by now.

102
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:19,470
Speaker 0: It's a really old system.

103
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:33,689
Speaker 0: And, in fact, in order to try to make a spicy headline, they talk about how, yeah, the Splatoon 2 NEX server has like an unused function in it that checks to see if the server is running Windows 98 or not.

104
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,843
Speaker 0: It's like that's how old the code is, right?

105
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:43,750
Speaker 0: But, yeah, the announcement is that, yeah, Nintendo is finally putting NEX basically in the dustbin.

106
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,129
Speaker 0: Monster Hunter Rise is going to be the first public use of the new system, NPLN.

107
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,963
Speaker 0: I assume that stands for, like, Nintendo Public Something Something.

108
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:58,668
Speaker 0: Who knows what it means?

109
00:07:58,788 --> 00:07:59,290
Speaker 0: Something Network.

110
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:07,650
Speaker 1: That is the level of journalistic commentary you're going to get from Geek Nights if you're new to the show.

111
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,670
Speaker 1: We've speculated on what one of those letters means.

112
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,472
Speaker 0: Link Network?

113
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,135
Speaker 0: I don't know.

114
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,206
Speaker 0: But, anyway, the point is Nintendo Player Link Network?

115
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:17,150
Speaker 0: That sounds good.

116
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,090
Speaker 0: It doesn't say what it stands for, though, right?

117
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,070
Speaker 1: If there was a D, I would assume it would stand for Disappointment.

118
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:30,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if anyone out there is going to play Monster Hunter Rise on the Switch and play the online multiplayer, right?

119
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,941
Speaker 0: Let us know if it's any fucking good.

120
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:35,548
Speaker 0: And, in fact...

121
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,409
Speaker 1: I'm not going to waste my time looking at it.

122
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,794
Speaker 0: In fact, it's in a preview phase right now.

123
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:47,710
Speaker 0: You can get a free demo of the game to try it out because they're using that free demo to test how NPLN performs under load.

124
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:58,370
Speaker 0: So, if that game's online multiplayer doesn't suck, that bodes well, and it probably means that all future Nintendo online games are going to be using that and not sucking.

125
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:08,690
Speaker 0: However, it could also mean every other Nintendo online thing that already exists might be shit-canned, right?

126
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,780
Speaker 0: Which is definitely going to happen at some point.

127
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,590
Speaker 0: You see, the Wii online already has been turned off.

128
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:19,890
Speaker 0: The 3DS is probably coming up next in terms of its online stuff getting the chop, right?

129
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:20,550
Speaker 0: Yep.

130
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:26,030
Speaker 1: Nintendo has, like, they've chopped reliably for their entire history, this kind of thing.

131
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,834
Speaker 0: I do not see the, what year is it, 2021?

132
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:37,439
Speaker 0: The Nintendo Switch online stuff, by 2020, I can pretty much guarantee you that.

133
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:50,570
Speaker 0: no Switch online stuff, the store, the Tetris 100, you know, Tetris, whatever it is, 99 Tetris, Tetris 99, whatever, you know, Mario 30, whatever, none of this stuff is going to be up.

134
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,933
Speaker 0: It'll all be turned off by 2020.

135
00:09:52,933 --> 00:10:04,030
Speaker 0: If you look at the timeline of the Wii, right, which is off now, and the Wii came out in, you know, 2006, '07, around the time that the iPhone 1 came out, right?

136
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:09,559
Speaker 0: So, that didn't last until 2020.

137
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,730
Speaker 0: So, yeah, and the Switch came out, you know, maybe 10 years after the Wii, so I don't think it's going to make it to 2030.

138
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,035
Speaker 0: Did I say 2020 before?

139
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:18,616
Speaker 0: I meant 2030.

140
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,360
Speaker 0: I'm old.

141
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,166
Speaker 0: The Switch online stuff is not going to make it to 2030.

142
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:23,527
Speaker 0: Don't bet on it.

143
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,392
Speaker 1: Yep.

144
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,170
Speaker 0: It's interesting because- Bet on the opposite.

145
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,340
Speaker 1: The technology behind it is only, like, a third of the, like, the problem with Nintendo online.

146
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,950
Speaker 1: because, honestly, even if the technology worked perfectly, there's so many other problems that make it just unusable.

147
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:53,041
Speaker 0: Like, the user experience is bad- You know, you can't really use it for the kinds of fast multiplayer real-time gaming that we like, the Counter-Strike style.

148
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,964
Speaker 0: It doesn't work for that, as far as I can tell.

149
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:58,389
Speaker 0: It's not latency-free enough for the fighting game Smash people.

150
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:59,230
Speaker 0: It's no good at that.

151
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,623
Speaker 1: The local wireless just doesn't work for anything, even, like, non-superfast things.

152
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,190
Speaker 1: Like, it just never worked, and I assume Nintendo will never get that right.

153
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:19,648
Speaker 0: But even on the Wii, and also now on the Switch, the sort of light multiplayer gaming, like, say, the Tetris 99, right, which is still presumably running on this next system, and even back on the Wii, there was a Dr.

154
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,210
Speaker 0: Mario game you could play multiplayer.

155
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,573
Speaker 0: That stuff worked, right?

156
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,175
Speaker 0: And the eShop, it works.

157
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:33,770
Speaker 0: So, the Animal Crossing stuff was a little flaky when it was new, but now it kind of works, right?

158
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:43,130
Speaker 0: So, some of it is down, but the stuff that needs the ultra-low latency many players, that's where it fails.

159
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:52,550
Speaker 1: So, in some other completely unrelated news, because it's Monday, not gaming day, we'll talk about the shutdown of Battleborn on the next Tuesday's show.

160
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,008
Speaker 0: Who cares about that?

161
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:59,448
Speaker 1: Because they're shutting it down to where even people who paid for it can't ever even play it single-player again.

162
00:11:59,508 --> 00:11:59,990
Speaker 1: It's just gone.

163
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:01,308
Speaker 0: Wow.

164
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:03,450
Speaker 1: It was online only, the entire experience.

165
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,031
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,197
Speaker 1: Anyway, we'll save that for another day.

167
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:11,610
Speaker 1: So, if there's one thing, you know, that we're going to talk about on Geek Nights, it's biking.

168
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,278
Speaker 1: But if there's another thing, it's both of us complaining about how there aren't good small phones.

169
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,442
Speaker 1: iPhones are better at that.

170
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:21,287
Speaker 1: Like, the smallest iPhones, pretty good.

171
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:22,990
Speaker 1: Like, that's actually an okay size.

172
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,410
Speaker 1: Like, the ship sailed on the size of phone I actually want, and I'm not going to die on that hill.

173
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,396
Speaker 0: iPhone 4 and 5 were, like...

174
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:32,890
Speaker 1: Oh my god, the iPhone 4.

175
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,769
Speaker 0: You can just buy an iPhone 5, it'll still work.

176
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:36,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it will.

177
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,438
Speaker 0: I don't think it runs the newest iOS.

178
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,390
Speaker 0: You need an iPhone 6 to run the newest iOS.

179
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,011
Speaker 1: Yup.

180
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,437
Speaker 1: But Android has been in a real rough spot on that.

181
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:50,089
Speaker 1: Like, the smallest Android phones that aren't just garbage, like basically a feature phone, are huge.

182
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,250
Speaker 1: And even the small, like the ones that are marketed as the small Android phone, are bigger than the smallest iPhones.

183
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:57,816
Speaker 1: They're still huge.

184
00:12:58,383 --> 00:12:58,990
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, they're big.

185
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:08,350
Speaker 0: I think part of it, you know, my conspiracy theory around all this, right, is that, you know, Apple started off with the iPods, right?

186
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:08,718
Speaker 0: Yup.

187
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,203
Speaker 0: And then they made them smaller and smaller and smaller.

188
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,350
Speaker 0: It was like iPod Nano.

189
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,524
Speaker 1: That iPod Nano was a phenomenal piece of hardware.

190
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:16,690
Speaker 1: I want a phone that big.

191
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:24,650
Speaker 0: People were excited about something being so small and thin, and Apple kept pushing small and thin, and people loved it, right?

192
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:30,100
Speaker 0: And then, suddenly, you know, the iPhones were trying to make them small.

193
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,084
Speaker 0: The iPhone 1 got smaller.

194
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,989
Speaker 0: The 3G was smaller, the 4 was smaller, the 5 was, right?

195
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,614
Speaker 0: So they made them smaller.

196
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,319
Speaker 0: They didn't make them bigger.

197
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,025
Speaker 0: They had done what they did with the iPod.

198
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:41,370
Speaker 0: They made them get small.

199
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,181
Speaker 0: Going small, technology-wise, is difficult and expensive, right?

200
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,965
Speaker 0: It's easy to make a big thing.

201
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,210
Speaker 0: It's hard to make a small thing.

202
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,538
Speaker 0: You gotta cram more shit in a smaller space with more constraints.

203
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,582
Speaker 0: You know, you got less room to work with.

204
00:13:56,663 --> 00:13:59,028
Speaker 0: You know, you might have to take out your headphone jack, right?

205
00:13:59,068 --> 00:13:59,609
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

206
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,537
Speaker 0: Making something big, it's like, "Oh man, this is

207
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:02,959
Speaker 0: easy.".

208
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,444
Speaker 0: More battery life?

209
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:05,147
Speaker 0: Not long enough?

210
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,010
Speaker 0: Bigger battery!

211
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,710
Speaker 1: A big phone with a giant screen will last longer because you can just cram lithium into that thing.

212
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's no problem.

213
00:14:14,216 --> 00:14:18,647
Speaker 0: So, it's like, huh, people were, at first, wanting smaller things.

214
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:19,990
Speaker 0: They wanted smaller iPod.

215
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,235
Speaker 0: And then, but now, people wanted bigger phones.

216
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:25,499
Speaker 0: I don't think people, right?

217
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,070
Speaker 0: It's, again, contributing to my belief that, for the most part, it's not people's wants that drive the market.

218
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,717
Speaker 0: It's the market that tells people what to want.

219
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:34,378
Speaker 0: Coupled with.

220
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,910
Speaker 0: People bought SUVs because they were told to buy SUVs, not because they wanted them in the first place.

221
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,773
Speaker 1: I agree with you, but with one caveat.

222
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,360
Speaker 1: I think there is an actual market force also at play.

223
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,210
Speaker 1: And I think that's the parallel move away from people even having a computer at all.

224
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:58,150
Speaker 1: And the number of Americans who have only a phone or a phone and a tablet, to the point that a lot of people want a phone.

225
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,570
Speaker 0: If you got a phone and a tablet, wouldn't you then still want the small phone and the big tablet?

226
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:08,330
Speaker 1: You'd think that, but what I have, what I see happening is a lot of people just want a big phone that's big enough to be a small tablet.

227
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:10,333
Speaker 0: And that's it, yeah.

228
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:11,054
Speaker 0: It makes sense.

229
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:20,070
Speaker 0: The point is, is that, you know, the way I see it is that people wanted the bigger phone because they were marketed to, to make them want the bigger phone instead of the smaller one.

230
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:30,290
Speaker 0: And then, you know, I think the reason that the marketing was telling people to get a big phone was because the other non-Apple phone makers couldn't produce the small phone.

231
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,434
Speaker 0: They just couldn't do it.

232
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:32,498
Speaker 0: It was too hard.

233
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,904
Speaker 0: They couldn't, right?

234
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:35,269
Speaker 0: Apple was just better than them.

235
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,676
Speaker 0: But also at small phone, they would have no chance.

236
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:46,170
Speaker 0: So they instead convinced people to want big phone and that way those people will, right, then they can actually compete with Apple, right?

237
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:50,930
Speaker 1: Especially because Android phones are usually sold at a lower price point to a different market segment.

238
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:52,330
Speaker 0: Indeed.

239
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,239
Speaker 0: And then, but the thing is, Apple's like, well, all right, you want to compete on big phone?

240
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:57,980
Speaker 0: We'll do that too.

241
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,350
Speaker 0: And the Apple, the iPhones is like several times faster than the Android phone.

242
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,990
Speaker 0: But people aren't caring about performance.

243
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:15,385
Speaker 1: Another thing that I think is still going on, and I've talked about this on Geek Notes before, is that Americans in particular have, like for a lot of reasons, like.

244
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:19,270
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's these people's fault because the real fault is our fucking healthcare system.

245
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:28,049
Speaker 1: But a huge percentage of adult Americans do have significant and uncorrected eye problems like vision problems.

246
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,053
Speaker 1: Correctable uncorrected eye problems.

247
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:42,390
Speaker 1: Couple that with the fact that as smartphones became more and more ubiquitous, we had this trend of a broader segment of society is using phones, including older people.

248
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:46,030
Speaker 1: So now there's more people who want a big phone because they can't read the tiny phone.

249
00:16:48,201 --> 00:17:03,040
Speaker 1: So all that combined, Sony was basically the only company making high quality, very expensive, very small Android phones like Sony is it.

250
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,020
Speaker 1: Like I think Sony smartphones have been consistently the best non Apple phones in the world.

251
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:13,648
Speaker 1: And they had a line, the Xperia line, which was like the pinnacle of that.

252
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,140
Speaker 1: And they had a subline, the Xperia compact line, which I'm a weird nerd about.

253
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:29,640
Speaker 1: I've used Xperia compacts basically for like a decade at this point, to the point that I bought two in this XZ1 compact because at the time this was the last small Android phone that was worth a damn.

254
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:37,033
Speaker 1: Sony kind of ruined it because after this one, there were more Xperia compacts.

255
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,180
Speaker 1: The Xperia compacts were bigger than a small iPhone.

256
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,280
Speaker 1: Like the compacts were getting bigger because the non compacts were just fucking tablets.

257
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Speaker 1: So out of nowhere, Sony is resurrecting the Xperia compact line specifically aimed at weirdos like me who actually want a tiny but extremely powerful phone.

258
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:01,160
Speaker 0: How big is it actually?

259
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,321
Speaker 1: TBD.

260
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,647
Speaker 1: There's a lot like we got to see.

261
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,050
Speaker 1: Here's the two things we know.

262
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:12,240
Speaker 1: They seem to be comparable to the XZ1 like the last time they were making actual small ones.

263
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,525
Speaker 1: And two, they will continue to have headphone jacks.

264
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:22,800
Speaker 1: Sony is doubling down on waterproof phones that have a real normal actual headphone jack to use.

265
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,422
Speaker 1: USB-C for charging.

266
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:30,992
Speaker 1: And I am going to follow this extremely closely unless there's something wrong with it.

267
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:36,000
Speaker 1: I'm probably going to buy this phone when it actually comes out and we'll see what happens.

268
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,402
Speaker 1: I don't know.

269
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,572
Speaker 1: My hope is like I know the ship sailed.

270
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:44,240
Speaker 1: Most people want big phones for all these reasons we talked about.

271
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,869
Speaker 1: All I want is for there to be a small phone.

272
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:51,518
Speaker 1: Like I want that option to exist for people who want it.

273
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:52,320
Speaker 1: That's all I want.

274
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,831
Speaker 0: The sales on the mini iPhone have actually not been incredible.

275
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:02,200
Speaker 0: Like they're there but they're not like blowing it out.

276
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:15,020
Speaker 1: And like we said, there's a lot of factors where people regardless of if it is the right tool for their use case or the right trend for society or all this stuff, most people now want very large phones for various reasons.

277
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,684
Speaker 1: So we'll see where this goes.

278
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:21,100
Speaker 1: Sony is pretty much the last game in town on Android and they're barely skimming.

279
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:35,080
Speaker 1: In some other news that was kind of just funny and sad, you can read these details but Tesla has to recall like over a hundred thousand of their vehicles because...

280
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,099
Speaker 0: No surprise there.

281
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:43,840
Speaker 1: But it's because the media control unit like the touch screen that's used to configure like everything on this stupid car.

282
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,199
Speaker 0: Oh I did see this news, yeah.

283
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,973
Speaker 1: Will just stop working eventually and it'll stop working.

284
00:19:49,993 --> 00:19:52,200
Speaker 1: I'm going to skip some of the details because you can read the article.

285
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:03,420
Speaker 1: But the reason it stops working is kind of a... It's sort of built in that it's guaranteed to fail after a certain number of times you have started the car.

286
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:14,999
Speaker 1: Because it will consume memory that basically will become non-reusable at a slow but steady rate every time the car boots and the car will boot every time you start the car.

287
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:28,420
Speaker 1: That just reeks of a company like Tesla not actually fully understanding the use cases of how normal people use cars.

288
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:43,520
Speaker 0: I know the specific problem is that you have flash memory and people don't necessarily realize that flash memory has a somewhat guaranteed-ish number of cycles.

289
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,800
Speaker 0: It's like you can write the bit over and over again so many times and then it's just done.

290
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:53,053
Speaker 0: I don't know if it locks in place, all I know is that it's done.

291
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:54,280
Speaker 0: You can't use it anymore.

292
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,627
Speaker 1: I mean, SSDs, it's known.

293
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:01,380
Speaker 1: If you read and write to the SSD in your computer too many times, eventually it's just going to break.

294
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:05,000
Speaker 1: That's a built-in limitation of that physical hardware.

295
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,500
Speaker 0: As opposed to, say, a magnetic hard drive which could last forever.

296
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:15,320
Speaker 1: I have a spinning disk in the HTPC that is terrifyingly old.

297
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,893
Speaker 0: I just sold a 20 megabyte SCSI hard drive for the Mac Plus.

298
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,318
Speaker 0: I sold it on eBay to somebody.

299
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:23,087
Speaker 0: It still worked.

300
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,617
Speaker 0: It was from the late 80s.

301
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:31,700
Speaker 0: If you opened it up, it just looked like a three and a half inch hard drive, only it was SCSI.

302
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,559
Speaker 0: The point is that the person writing the software was basically saying, "Look, I want to count how many times the car has been turned

303
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:40,719
Speaker 0: on.".

304
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:48,839
Speaker 0: So they just say, "When you boot, read this number from memory, increment it by one, and write it back to

305
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:49,120
Speaker 0: memory.".

306
00:21:51,041 --> 00:22:00,799
Speaker 0: But the programmer isn't thinking about the system as a whole, realizing, "Oh, that piece of memory that I'm writing to is the splash

307
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:00,980
Speaker 0: memory.".

308
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,421
Speaker 0: Right.

309
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:16,259
Speaker 0: That I can only write to so many times, and therefore the car will only be able to turn on so many times, and the code will... You could have written something like, "Hey, if it fails, do something

310
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,360
Speaker 0: else.".

311
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 1: In a computer with your SSD, if you write some code that's going to use your SSD, the microcontroller in the SSD does a bunch of stuff to abstract that away from you and handle that kind of problem.

312
00:22:32,122 --> 00:22:36,020
Speaker 0: To extend the life of the drive as much as possible, but it will eventually break.

313
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,080
Speaker 0: But when it does, you're not in a car, you're not sitting where you can't start your car, you can't start your computer, so you just go buy a new one.

314
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:48,820
Speaker 1: It's also the MBTF, the Mean Time Before Failure, MTBF, of that component.

315
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,960
Speaker 1: A computer person knows the mean time before a failure of an SSD, and you take that into account when you build systems.

316
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,180
Speaker 0: But if you're in a car, you can't have that, right?

317
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:06,974
Speaker 0: So when you're engineering the system, we've gotten too used to, in engineering most products that have computers in them, of doing the hardware, the low-level programming.

318
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:23,420
Speaker 0: Every layer of abstraction has a different engineer, and they create interfaces and abstraction layers to communicate with each other, but nobody is considering the whole thing together.

319
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:35,160
Speaker 0: Because A, it's so ridiculously difficult to do that with the complexity of the systems we develop these days, but also there just aren't people who understand all the different abstraction layers.

320
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:45,539
Speaker 0: Or you're someone like me, where it's like, yeah, I understand from point A to point Z, but I just don't want to get involved in some of those layers.

321
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:51,758
Speaker 0: I just want to stick to the ones I like and not deal with, say, the JavaScript-y layer out there.

322
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,658
Speaker 1: Well, this gets into a fundamental point that we've talked about in Geek Nights way back around engineering and engineering.

323
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:14,260
Speaker 0: If you're doing cars, you have to do the whole thing from top to bottom and consider the consequences of some decision in the dashboard all the way down to the wiring and the chips you got in there.

324
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:24,060
Speaker 1: The classic example, the one that everyone always in every textbook is Therac-25, that medical machine that shot radiation at people, and a bug in that software killed people.

325
00:24:25,741 --> 00:24:30,200
Speaker 1: That's a world, that's when engineering needs to have formal practices and certifications.

326
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:37,899
Speaker 0: It's no surprise that a shit show like Tesla does not have the engineering rigor in place.

327
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,200
Speaker 1: No surprise at all.

328
00:24:41,540 --> 00:25:03,240
Speaker 1: I saw a commentator who said something to the effect of, this was years ago, bit by bit, Tesla is learning that disrupting the car industry is not that easy when you ignore the 40 years of collected expertise of the modern car industry that figured out solutions to these fundamental problems and you want to reinvent all of that.

329
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:09,467
Speaker 1: Sometimes things are inefficient because you don't understand them sufficiently.

330
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:16,700
Speaker 1: I'm talking mostly to Silicon Valley tech bros who seem to always think they can come into some industry they don't know anything about and optimize it.

331
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Speaker 0: Well, sometimes they do by cutting a corner.

332
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,639
Speaker 1: That was a load-bearing corner right there.

333
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:28,174
Speaker 0: That ends up being good enough for a lot of people and you can fuck shit up a whole lot.

334
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,880
Speaker 0: and then, you know, things get shitty.

335
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,600
Speaker 0: But also and you beat up, you know, and now suddenly capitalism, so you've destroyed the good thing that was there already.

336
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:41,320
Speaker 0: But now we've all lost because we lost the good thing, the shitty thing.

337
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,090
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

338
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:55,830
Speaker 1: So I don't want to use a whole bunch of skiing things because I think I was talking about skiing the other day and I used to think of the day about it, but this is pretty cool.

339
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,792
Speaker 1: This is footage of a ski jump competition from 1939.

340
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:03,808
Speaker 0: I knew it had to be an old one.

341
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,137
Speaker 1: Yep.

342
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:06,689
Speaker 0: The craziest thing about it.

343
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:10,270
Speaker 0: The jumps are really short and lame and uncool.

344
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,481
Speaker 1: One, these people all suck ass at skiing.

345
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:16,447
Speaker 0: Like holy shit are they bad.

346
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,850
Speaker 0: Side note, I'm trying to like say lameless because I've been told that's an ableist word which makes perfect sense.

347
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,142
Speaker 1: I try to avoid it.

348
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,888
Speaker 0: I keep saying it.

349
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:33,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a. it's a tough one, especially because I get conflicting messages from different communities where that word is relevant to them.

350
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,330
Speaker 1: So I'm just trying to avoid using it generally.

351
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:36,011
Speaker 0: Yeah.

352
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:41,390
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is, there are plenty of examples out there of, you know, watch old sport, watch new sport.

353
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:46,110
Speaker 0: And you'll see, you know, wow, people were less good at sport then in the past.

354
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,202
Speaker 0: There's a gif that goes around showing you like the gold medal, like vault jump from like the 40s versus, you know, the 2000s.

355
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:06,950
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, so nowadays ski jumpers aren't going for distance because they can go so far that it becomes dangerous to it, like to an unacceptable degree.

356
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:11,830
Speaker 0: And they're just make a ski jump place that is super long so you can go farther.

357
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:13,330
Speaker 1: You need a long enough slope.

358
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:14,649
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons for this.

359
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,909
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll make that a thing of the day, a video that explains the physics of that.

360
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,890
Speaker 1: But anyway, in the old days, they went for distance because they couldn't really get that far.

361
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,070
Speaker 1: And the funniest thing is their technique.

362
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:27,770
Speaker 1: Everyone like has their own special technique.

363
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:32,870
Speaker 1: A few of them are trying to like windmill their arms to get themselves a little more like momentum.

364
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,630
Speaker 1: Some of them are actually flapping.

365
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:38,590
Speaker 1: It's just kind of funny and sad.

366
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,369
Speaker 1: You watch a modern ski jump.

367
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:44,190
Speaker 0: Before we had scientifically determined the optimal technique, right?

368
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,290
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, people are just going to try whatever they can try.

369
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,590
Speaker 1: Look at old timey baseball.

370
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:55,010
Speaker 1: A lot more interesting things happen before people realized, wait a minute, all we have to do is just hit home runs and nothing else.

371
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,269
Speaker 1: Why don't we just optimize hitting home runs and nothing else?

372
00:28:01,032 --> 00:28:01,568
Speaker 0: A little roboty.

373
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,147
Speaker 0: You're getting a little roboty.

374
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:03,573
Speaker 1: Yeah.

375
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:05,330
Speaker 1: Besides a local recording will be fine.

376
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,610
Speaker 1: But there seems to be some Internet bandwidth issues out in the wild.

377
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:09,732
Speaker 0: OK.

378
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:12,190
Speaker 0: So anyway, I think I talked about this somewhere recently.

379
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:13,029
Speaker 0: I forget where.

380
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,770
Speaker 0: It might have just been a private conversation, but I saw the 60 second documentary.

381
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,210
Speaker 0: It's a whole YouTube channel of 60 second documentary.

382
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,990
Speaker 0: I don't know if the channel is any good or not.

383
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,749
Speaker 0: That's you can find that on your own.

384
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:24,950
Speaker 0: This is the only video I've watched on this channel.

385
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:30,330
Speaker 0: And it is a documentary of a person whose only job in life.

386
00:28:31,036 --> 00:28:31,247
Speaker 0: Right.

387
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:35,690
Speaker 0: Is that they are a squirrel wildlife photographer.

388
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,965
Speaker 0: All they do in Nikki Coleman.

389
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,147
Speaker 0: All this person does is photograph squirrels.

390
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,931
Speaker 0: Right.

391
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:45,949
Speaker 0: They set up and they become like an expert at doing this.

392
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:50,910
Speaker 0: And you can learn about, you know, 60 seconds worth of information about this person.

393
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:56,210
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you have any interest in, you know, the arts.

394
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:56,873
Speaker 0: Right.

395
00:28:56,933 --> 00:29:00,670
Speaker 0: You know, photography specifically, I think this is a great, you know, lesson.

396
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:02,630
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you need to find your thing.

397
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,810
Speaker 0: Whatever your thing is, I can't tell you how to find it.

398
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,730
Speaker 0: I haven't found my thing.

399
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,560
Speaker 0: You found your thing.

400
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:06,966
Speaker 0: I don't know.

401
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,049
Speaker 0: But if you can find your thing.

402
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,050
Speaker 1: Apparently, my thing is the fixed protocol.

403
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,888
Speaker 1: God damn it.

404
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:14,134
Speaker 0: Right.

405
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:16,190
Speaker 0: It's like, why was that?

406
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,188
Speaker 0: Why can't I have a cool thing like taking fun pictures of squirrels?

407
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,549
Speaker 1: That's my cutie mark.

408
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,949
Speaker 1: Thirty nine equals three just appeared on my ass one day.

409
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,330
Speaker 0: Exactly.

410
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:30,730
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, this guy, pretty cool stuff here.

411
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:32,250
Speaker 0: Great photos.

412
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,790
Speaker 1: Also, squirrels are great to photograph in general because squirrels are just great.

414
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:49,949
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, I feel like between the snow and the fact that I'm still just stuck inside and going crazy, might start reading the tale of Genji again.

415
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:51,398
Speaker 1: Because I keep reading.

416
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,510
Speaker 0: every time I'm going to read, I read a comic book instead.

417
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,230
Speaker 1: Every time I'm going to read, I read nonfiction instead.

418
00:29:57,571 --> 00:29:59,550
Speaker 1: But like I said, there was that book I was reading.

419
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,387
Speaker 1: I'm almost done with it.

420
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:02,210
Speaker 1: The nonfiction book I was reading.

421
00:30:02,872 --> 00:30:05,589
Speaker 1: And I felt this urge to read a fiction book.

422
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:14,130
Speaker 1: And I decided that the moment I have the urge to read a fiction book in the apartment, I'm going to read the tale of Genji instead of whatever I had an urge to read.

423
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:16,229
Speaker 1: Because I do also want to read the tale of Genji.

424
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,870
Speaker 1: My rule is I cannot read any fiction unless it's the tale of Genji.

425
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,529
Speaker 1: But I'm still reading nonfiction for now, but that might change real soon.

426
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:32,685
Speaker 0: You know what happened to me is these hockey games and also video games keep taking my... Every time I got some free time, I find something else to fill it with.

427
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:33,650
Speaker 0: that isn't that.

428
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,133
Speaker 1: Yup.

429
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,570
Speaker 1: Like I'll be at my computer.

430
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,130
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, I could just go sit in the other room and read.

431
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,710
Speaker 1: And then Hades just starts and playing Hades for a while.

432
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,369
Speaker 1: And then someone's like, hey, you want to play Phasmophobia in VR?

433
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,387
Speaker 1: And now I'm in VR.

434
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,127
Speaker 1: And then it's midnight and I got to go to bed.

435
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:49,440
Speaker 0: Yup.

436
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,130
Speaker 1: Hades just keeps falling back into my hands.

437
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,749
Speaker 1: That game just is... It's satisfying an itch.

438
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,110
Speaker 0: Yup.

439
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,689
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

440
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,979
Speaker 0: It is.

441
00:30:58,071 --> 00:30:58,829
Speaker 1: I just didn't have the patience.

442
00:30:59,093 --> 00:30:59,749
Speaker 1: We already reviewed it.

443
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,450
Speaker 1: Listen to that episode if you want to hear us talk about Hades.

444
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,470
Speaker 1: Today, we're going to talk about something we've never really talked about on Geek Nights.

445
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:08,088
Speaker 1: But I want to point out that...

446
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,527
Speaker 0: Have we?

447
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,029
Speaker 1: We may have.

448
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:12,170
Speaker 1: I mean, I've definitely deleted that episode.

449
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:22,210
Speaker 1: I think when we've talked about this, we've always talked about it in the context of e-waste, like physical trash, old components, mining, that kind of stuff.

450
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:35,470
Speaker 1: What we're talking about today is the environmental consequences of computing, as in doing calculations on computers, as in all that electricity that people are burning to mine Bitcoins.

451
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,290
Speaker 0: Well, that's the big one, right?

452
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,469
Speaker 0: That's the elephant in the room.

453
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,090
Speaker 0: But there's so many other things.

454
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,889
Speaker 0: It's like there's several elephants in the room.

455
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,589
Speaker 0: That's just the biggest elephant that everyone's looking at.

456
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:47,810
Speaker 0: So let's talk about that one first, right?

457
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:56,409
Speaker 1: But I want to preface this by saying we're not going to get too deep into what she wrote and why this is all important, because you should read this stuff too.

458
00:31:56,932 --> 00:32:00,130
Speaker 1: But you can read it in her words and the words of all the experts in the space.

459
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:15,209
Speaker 1: But you might have seen this story about how Timnit Gebru was basically ousted from Google for asking these kinds of questions and trying to put rigor behind that research and point out these types of problems and concerns.

460
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:23,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another conversation I want to have is about private research at the private, you know, research at the private corporations like Google.

461
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:23,592
Speaker 0: Right.

462
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:24,589
Speaker 0: And you know whatnot.

463
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:29,630
Speaker 0: But and there's also lots of spoilers when private for-profit companies commissioned research.

464
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,409
Speaker 1: They're really only interested in research that makes them more money.

465
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:33,630
Speaker 1: Yeah.

466
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,190
Speaker 1: They don't want to hear bad answers.

467
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:40,850
Speaker 0: There's also all sorts of, you know, the typical or sadly typical.

468
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,270
Speaker 1: Sexism, racism also gets people ignored.

469
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, sexism, racism going on in that particular story.

470
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:49,390
Speaker 0: Google doesn't look good in that story, is all I can say.

471
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,950
Speaker 0: But anyway, the right.

472
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,199
Speaker 0: So you got a computer, right?

473
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:03,310
Speaker 0: To make a computer requires energy at the computer at the mine to get the raw materials.

474
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:04,450
Speaker 0: You're mostly mining.

475
00:33:04,513 --> 00:33:04,868
Speaker 0: Right.

476
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,906
Speaker 0: But also other things.

477
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:10,769
Speaker 0: Energy to transport along every step of this supply chain.

478
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:13,230
Speaker 0: Energy to protect the factories.

479
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,770
Speaker 0: Are they making chips and boards and all that kind of, you know, cases and plastic and screws and everything.

480
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,447
Speaker 0: Shipping again.

481
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,750
Speaker 0: I'll just shipping every step of the way.

482
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:22,950
Speaker 0: Right.

483
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,530
Speaker 0: You don't need to explain it over and over again.

484
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:32,689
Speaker 0: The shipping and then the packaging, you know, whatever you put it all together, you start using it.

485
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:41,650
Speaker 0: And it's like, OK, you've already, you know, taken all the rare earth metals from, you know, who knows what kind of place and what conditions and what kind of laborers and everything.

486
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:46,010
Speaker 0: And now you're, you know, whatever your power system is in your house.

487
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,469
Speaker 0: Maybe you live in a house of the solar panel and, you know, great.

488
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,329
Speaker 0: But maybe you don't.

489
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,050
Speaker 0: And maybe you've got a coal power plant power in your house.

490
00:33:55,254 --> 00:33:55,869
Speaker 0: Not so great.

491
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,350
Speaker 1: Fun fact.

492
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,829
Speaker 0: How much energy does your computer use?

493
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:01,090
Speaker 0: Right.

494
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:15,409
Speaker 0: And then how much work does your computer get done in terms of not just how many, you know, instructions does it process, how much work you have it doing, but the work that it is doing.

495
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,690
Speaker 0: How much is that benefiting people and society?

496
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:18,969
Speaker 0: Right.

497
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:25,529
Speaker 0: I could run a fancy 3D screensaver and not be in the room to even look at it.

498
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,050
Speaker 0: So it's doing nothing for anybody.

499
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:29,489
Speaker 0: It's heating my house.

500
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:32,150
Speaker 0: Maybe it's cold out and it's efficient space heater.

501
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,027
Speaker 0: It's like, that's about it.

502
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:35,445
Speaker 0: Is that worth it?

503
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,070
Speaker 0: Would we have been better off with a space heater instead?

504
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:46,270
Speaker 1: But this is a conversation that almost no one in the computing world even wants to have.

505
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,129
Speaker 1: Like, no one wants to talk about this.

506
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,069
Speaker 1: And they'll often, like, you'll be, if you try to bring this kind of stuff up, you'll be accused of being reductive.

507
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,870
Speaker 1: It's like, it's just, everyone's really avoiding this conversation.

508
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,164
Speaker 0: It's also so complete.

509
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:12,370
Speaker 0: The kind of questions, if you actually start to dig into this, the kind of questions you have to ask becomes so difficult with so many factors involved that it's like nobody wants to find the answer.

510
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,750
Speaker 0: And in fact, finding the answer may be more costly.

511
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:24,550
Speaker 0: So, for example, let's say you wanted to calculate, you know, OK, we want to, I don't know, render.

512
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,889
Speaker 0: We're going to make a CG movie.

513
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:26,430
Speaker 0: Right.

514
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,029
Speaker 0: And we're going to need to render the whole movie.

515
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,310
Speaker 0: It's so fancy looking.

516
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:32,329
Speaker 0: It's going to take this server farm like a whole week to render it.

517
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:35,550
Speaker 0: You know, and we'll probably have to do the render several times because, you know, movies.

518
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:35,949
Speaker 0: Right.

519
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,170
Speaker 0: And it's all those sorts of things.

520
00:35:37,254 --> 00:35:37,469
Speaker 0: Right.

521
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:40,310
Speaker 0: Or however it works these days.

522
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,670
Speaker 0: But we've got the server is going to render.

523
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:43,450
Speaker 0: It's going to use this much energy.

524
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:44,369
Speaker 0: Right.

525
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:45,830
Speaker 0: To produce the renders.

526
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,130
Speaker 0: And, you know, that's going to take, you know, it's powered by this kind of power.

527
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,329
Speaker 0: And, you know, you want to figure out, is it worth it?

528
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:55,701
Speaker 0: Right.

529
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,710
Speaker 0: It's going to cost us this much money is going to have this much climate impact.

530
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,428
Speaker 0: Should we do it?

531
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,388
Speaker 0: Should we not do it?

532
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:00,844
Speaker 0: OK.

533
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:02,050
Speaker 0: You want to figure that out?

534
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:02,887
Speaker 0: Guess what you have to do?

535
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:08,170
Speaker 0: You have to get some computers and calculate whether it's worth it or not.

536
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:14,208
Speaker 0: And doing that calculation, you might say, finish that calculation and say, OK, we've figured out it's worth it.

537
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:21,321
Speaker 0: But because we had to spend this extra energy on figuring out if it was worth it, now it's not worth it.

538
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:21,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

539
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:25,689
Speaker 0: Well, I spent part of our budget on figuring out whether it was worth it.

540
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:34,690
Speaker 1: Well, like there was an old thing in like the older days where large skyscrapers would often leave lights on at night and people would see that as very wasteful.

541
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:49,828
Speaker 1: But in some situations, the reason for that was that leaving those lights on actually generated the heat necessary to keep the building at a baseline temperature using less energy than the HVAC system doing that work.

542
00:36:51,391 --> 00:37:02,110
Speaker 1: But or the rendering thing, what about the cost of shipping the food to the place where the people are working for like to make all the motion capture to do that film?

543
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,309
Speaker 1: Like, how deep do you go?

544
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,650
Speaker 1: It almost turns into the coastline problem of how long is a coastline?

545
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:11,310
Speaker 1: Because any surface, if measured in enough detail, is infinitely long.

546
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:14,490
Speaker 1: So this gets really challenging.

547
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:23,629
Speaker 1: And then you get into weird, almost trolley problem conversations that aren't actually useful, especially when you try to zoom in too far.

548
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:35,370
Speaker 1: So at the bottom end of this, you can have conversations like, is it ethical to let someone who's not creating have a fancy video card that will use a lot of electricity?

549
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:42,890
Speaker 1: On the upper end, you've got a conversation like, should we ban Bitcoin because people are literally burning coal to mine Bitcoins for nothing?

550
00:37:44,677 --> 00:37:45,810
Speaker 1: I think we should ban Bitcoin.

551
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:52,150
Speaker 1: I think there's a thing we can't lose sight of having those zoomed in conversations.

552
00:37:52,731 --> 00:38:14,149
Speaker 1: But what I've seen and I think you've seen this, too, is that the entities that are responsible for most of the pollution, especially in this space, are the ones who push the narrative of individual and consumer responsibility and activism when they are contributing the vast majority of the problem in the first place.

553
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,009
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

554
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:18,210
Speaker 1: Not saying you shouldn't be more efficient.

555
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:26,930
Speaker 0: A car company or a fossil fuel company like a gas company might be blaming the people driving.

556
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,530
Speaker 0: They'll say, hey, drive more efficiently.

557
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,749
Speaker 0: Use an electric car.

558
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:36,085
Speaker 1: Fuck you for creating that moral hazard by making the less efficient car cheaper in the first place.

559
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:40,709
Speaker 0: It's like, why are you marketing SUVs then?

560
00:38:43,432 --> 00:38:47,829
Speaker 0: You're blaming people for doing a bad thing while simultaneously trying to convince people to do the bad thing.

561
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:53,290
Speaker 0: The boat that you have that carries cars from the other side of the world to the U.S.

562
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,070
Speaker 0: causes more pollution than all those cars will in their lifetimes.

563
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:16,970
Speaker 0: If you look at the percentage of pollution, big shipping boats cause a huge, huge percentage of the world's pollution, like you not switching from a gas to an electric stove in your house is going to make no dent whatsoever in terms of scale wise.

564
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:18,629
Speaker 1: Now, not saying you shouldn't do it.

565
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:21,950
Speaker 0: Should we ban importing cars from other places?

566
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:23,309
Speaker 0: You have to get a domestic car.

567
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:29,849
Speaker 1: But then what if the economies of scale mean that distributing that manufacturing ends up making way more waste?

568
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:31,110
Speaker 0: Yeah.

569
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,948
Speaker 0: And we have more factory, more car factories than instead of fewer car centralized car factories.

570
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:36,850
Speaker 0: Right.

571
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,130
Speaker 0: Something like data centers.

572
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:38,530
Speaker 0: Right.

573
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,030
Speaker 0: We talk about like, you know, no one wants to use Google Stadia.

574
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,155
Speaker 0: Right.

575
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,386
Speaker 0: We talked about or the.

576
00:39:42,936 --> 00:39:43,548
Speaker 0: But you know what?

577
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:49,489
Speaker 0: Right now, you got a situation where it's like, OK, let's say everyone has a computer in their house.

578
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,650
Speaker 0: Well, a lot of those computers are off and not being used.

579
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,510
Speaker 0: You know, PlayStation fives or whatever.

580
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:54,788
Speaker 0: Everyone.

581
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,129
Speaker 0: People have them, you know, but a lot of them are not being used.

582
00:39:58,511 --> 00:40:06,649
Speaker 0: We spent, you know, material resources and also the PlayStation factory itself produced way more PlayStation fives than we need.

583
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,950
Speaker 0: We only need the number that are being used at once simultaneously.

584
00:40:11,272 --> 00:40:14,990
Speaker 0: We don't need the number that people who want to play one ever.

585
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:15,750
Speaker 0: Right.

586
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,070
Speaker 0: So every time someone buys one, it just sits there unused.

587
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:20,590
Speaker 0: That was a waste.

588
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,809
Speaker 0: They could have someone else could be using that one right now.

589
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:35,529
Speaker 0: Instead, if we do what Google Stadia does, which no one likes for good reasons, you could just have all of the computers in one place and have exactly the number that we're going to need to be used.

590
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:38,170
Speaker 0: And whenever anyone needs to use one, they start using one.

591
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,809
Speaker 0: And when they're not using it, someone else uses it.

592
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:47,650
Speaker 0: And the amount of materials saved would allow the factory to produce less of them in the first place.

593
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:58,929
Speaker 0: We could ship them to instead of distributing them widely, we can distribute them more narrowly to a single place where they're going to be run, powered by a single power source, cooled more efficiently in a group.

594
00:41:01,071 --> 00:41:12,030
Speaker 0: So if you look at a single product like that, it's like you can start to see, aha, that is that would be better if you're considering, you know, the environmental concern there.

595
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,250
Speaker 1: Only so in.

596
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:18,550
Speaker 1: But in terms of computing specific, actually, one more point on that with the local stuff.

597
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:25,710
Speaker 1: What about a professional who is like a 3D animator, like working contract for some like studios somewhere?

598
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,850
Speaker 1: They need that power locally.

599
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:32,390
Speaker 1: And if they couldn't have it locally, they would be forced to use these online services.

600
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:35,990
Speaker 1: that might be less optimal compared to what they would do professionally.

601
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,830
Speaker 1: So but I just got a calculation.

602
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:46,722
Speaker 1: The other thing that happens, because I was thinking about this earlier, is like, yeah, I have a computer right now that can draw like 600 watts.

603
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:55,590
Speaker 1: Like I got a 700 watt power supply and I push it near its limit if I'm doing certain things on this computer, like rendering out a geek night's panel.

604
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a 600 watt space heater sitting in here for like four hours or so.

605
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:15,608
Speaker 1: But that 600 watts, if we go back in time to 1988, let's say, 1989, that's six fucking light bulbs in my house.

606
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,590
Speaker 1: So they're like, but individual consumers did not want LEDs.

607
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,147
Speaker 0: Or 10 light bulbs if you got 60 watts.

608
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,730
Speaker 1: We did all hundred waters because we wanted light.

609
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,166
Speaker 1: Like everyone has to be dark like everyone else is.

610
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:40,910
Speaker 1: But so if you get to the situation where like the light bulbs are a really good example, incandescent light bulbs were ridiculously wasteful from an electricity standpoint.

611
00:42:41,732 --> 00:42:42,341
Speaker 1: But they were LED ones.

612
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:46,430
Speaker 1: But they were extremely efficient from a manufacturing standpoint.

613
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,750
Speaker 1: They were also extremely cheap, extremely simple, extremely easy.

614
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:57,510
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of benefits to them, but they generate a lot of heat and they waste ridiculous amounts of electricity.

615
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:17,888
Speaker 1: LEDs and CFLs without government action would be so much more expensive than them that it would be like arguably evil to ask consumers to buy those fancier lights to save energy when it would cost them a lot and individually not benefit them at all.

616
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:25,650
Speaker 1: The only reason we were able to move forward with more efficient lights over time was because of government mandates.

617
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,710
Speaker 1: We banned and phased out incandescent lights for a reason.

618
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,610
Speaker 1: That economy of scale, honestly, and this is just opinion, is what I think we need.

619
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:39,750
Speaker 1: We need regulation of the use of mass computing resources.

620
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:48,427
Speaker 1: Similarly to how we regulate factories, Google data centers should be regulated on their energy usage the same way an IBM chip fab is.

621
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:53,110
Speaker 1: Well actually they should both be regulated more too, but that's a separate problem.

622
00:43:53,250 --> 00:44:00,296
Speaker 0: I mean we already have this sort of regulation with cars in some, I guess not all states have this, they have emissions tests, right?

623
00:44:00,336 --> 00:44:02,950
Speaker 0: If your car doesn't pass emissions, we won't let you drive it on the road.

624
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,630
Speaker 0: Sometimes there's an exception for like a classic car or something.

625
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:10,850
Speaker 1: Well just like there's exceptions for incandescent bulbs in like a historical house.

626
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,443
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like, yeah, okay, you want to have a factory.

627
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,730
Speaker 0: If your factory can't pass the emissions test, we're going to shut your factory down.

628
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:20,990
Speaker 0: It's got to be energy efficient.

629
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:35,650
Speaker 0: They've gone, in New York, New York City at least, they have the ratings on restaurants for how healthy, how sanitary they are, but the Department of Health comes around or whatever and they mark you like a restaurant, very clean, right?

630
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,844
Speaker 0: Oh, we saw rats in your restaurant, F, right?

631
00:44:37,864 --> 00:44:38,630
Speaker 0: We're going to shut you down.

632
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:43,750
Speaker 0: They recently put up energy ratings on all the buildings, simply informative.

633
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,196
Speaker 0: I don't think that they are.

634
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,330
Speaker 0: how, what system they use to do the grading.

635
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,810
Speaker 1: Like the leads thing, because Europe's been doing this for a while.

636
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,268
Speaker 1: Like Germany's really good about this.

637
00:44:52,470 --> 00:45:03,790
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any enforcement around it yet, but I know that our building got like an A, like a 90 something grade in terms of energy efficiency and other buildings got like, you know, just near us, like they look like super new buildings.

638
00:45:04,113 --> 00:45:05,409
Speaker 0: They've got like D's and F's.

639
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:12,910
Speaker 0: So like they must be doing something in that building that is like, you know, I don't know, they're poorly insulated, their heating system shitty, their cooling system shitty.

640
00:45:13,513 --> 00:45:14,402
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're doing.

641
00:45:14,483 --> 00:45:15,170
Speaker 0: that's bad.

642
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,090
Speaker 0: You know, maybe their roof is not white.

643
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,506
Speaker 0: I don't know why their windows are bad.

644
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:22,405
Speaker 0: I don't know.

645
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:29,070
Speaker 0: But they're doing something that is making the building, you know, have lots of, you know, emissions and waste energy usage.

646
00:45:29,255 --> 00:45:29,707
Speaker 0: It's not good.

647
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:35,610
Speaker 1: So the specific thing that we want you to think about because we're going to end the show soon.

648
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,250
Speaker 1: I'm getting a little hungry.

649
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,167
Speaker 1: Got some things to do.

650
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,808
Speaker 1: But because we're not experts in this space at all.

651
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,327
Speaker 1: Like don't think that we're experts here.

652
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,710
Speaker 1: We're just we happen to just be two white guys doing a podcast.

653
00:45:46,195 --> 00:45:46,810
Speaker 1: But that's right.

654
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,850
Speaker 1: What this paper raised is something that almost no one is thinking about.

655
00:45:51,311 --> 00:46:01,684
Speaker 1: Specifically, the carbon footprint, which mostly comes from the electricity used to run the computers that are doing A.I.

656
00:46:01,804 --> 00:46:03,470
Speaker 1: shit right now, like machine learning.

657
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:07,470
Speaker 1: It's not like, oh, yes, the computers use more.

658
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,030
Speaker 1: But are they using that much more than what data centers did previously?

659
00:46:11,574 --> 00:46:11,764
Speaker 1: Like, no.

660
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:22,870
Speaker 1: Machine learning, like using a machine learning model to answer a question generates so much carbon dioxide that we need to be talking about that.

661
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:39,690
Speaker 1: The problems we're solving with machine learning, irrespective of all the other moral hazards there, like implicit bias and algorithms, like we're encoding racism and sexism into these solutions, even independent of all of that, we're literally burning coal to solve these problems.

662
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:46,050
Speaker 1: Services we use online that do like facial recognition arguably are burning coal to make that happen.

663
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:48,849
Speaker 1: Huge amounts of it.

664
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:54,130
Speaker 1: And part of this paper that sort of triggered our conversation is quantifying that.

665
00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:08,526
Speaker 1: And that is what is making a lot of people uncomfortable, pointing out the specific carbon footprint of one transformer with two hundred thirteen million parameters in a neural architecture search generates six hundred thousand pounds of CO2.

666
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,029
Speaker 0: So, you know, just to end it one more.

667
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:14,210
Speaker 1: Like that Tesla thing.

668
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,969
Speaker 1: A programmer doesn't think about that.

669
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,110
Speaker 1: He just writes the algorithm.

670
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,710
Speaker 1: Well, they just write the algorithm.

671
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,568
Speaker 1: See, implicit bias just creeps in.

672
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,770
Speaker 0: I just want to have one more scenario since it was so relevant to our snow day story.

673
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,550
Speaker 0: So let's think about, you know, the cost of the remote learning.

674
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:29,884
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,670
Speaker 0: Energy wise.

676
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,210
Speaker 0: All right.

677
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,230
Speaker 1: Millions of kids.

678
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:39,190
Speaker 0: I was reading stories recently talking about how, yeah, actually we're using tons of energy collectively by doing video chat.

679
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:45,690
Speaker 0: If you just turn off your video during video chat when it's not necessary, you'll say if everyone did that, we would save quite a bit.

680
00:47:45,811 --> 00:47:48,550
Speaker 0: But it's like, OK, well, so every school is remote learning.

681
00:47:48,973 --> 00:47:50,690
Speaker 0: So all these kids have their video on all day.

682
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:52,230
Speaker 0: It's using up a lot of electricity.

683
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:55,430
Speaker 0: But those kids aren't going to school.

684
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:58,650
Speaker 0: So the transportation cost of going to school is now gone.

685
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:07,550
Speaker 1: There's also a social cost of not having video chat on deeply reduces engagement, especially with education.

686
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:09,309
Speaker 1: There seem to be some early papers about that.

687
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,490
Speaker 0: But the school building, you might not need the school building anymore.

688
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,850
Speaker 0: You might be able to just get rid of school buildings.

689
00:48:15,991 --> 00:48:19,269
Speaker 0: Those are using up lots of energy, heating, cooling, lights, etc.

690
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:29,985
Speaker 0: But then you'll lose like, well, some things you can't do at school, you know, like chemistry lab or, you know, band, I guess would be difficult or sports or any.

691
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:35,550
Speaker 0: It's like you're missing those learning opportunities if you don't have the school building anymore.

692
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,910
Speaker 0: And you.

693
00:48:36,017 --> 00:48:36,189
Speaker 0: Right.

694
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:46,470
Speaker 0: So it's like there's all these tradeoffs, you know, my computer is on, but that means the heater in my office turns on less often than the heaters in the other rooms.

695
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,310
Speaker 0: Right.

696
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:51,650
Speaker 0: So it's like, am I using this electricity or am I using the gas that goes into the heat?

697
00:48:52,351 --> 00:48:54,230
Speaker 1: I've talked I've used this every now and then.

698
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,710
Speaker 1: But let's think like forward thinking.

699
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:58,866
Speaker 0: So if we use if we use the energy on the machine learning, are we going to?

700
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:02,790
Speaker 0: is that going to result in a savings elsewhere to offset it?

701
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,127
Speaker 0: That makes it, you know, OK.

702
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:14,009
Speaker 1: In the same way that the increased manufacturing cost of LED is is very likely a net benefit to society because of the radical decrease in electricity use.

703
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:18,530
Speaker 1: So future thinking.

704
00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:19,928
Speaker 1: Remember this.

705
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:26,109
Speaker 1: There is literally no difference between an electric space heater and a computer.

706
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,650
Speaker 1: Fundamentally, you pump electrons through it and heat comes out.

707
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,250
Speaker 1: I think there is a far future.

708
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:43,230
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons we can't do this yet, where arguably as we move to an electricity driven society and back away from fossil fuels, we're already in an electricity driven society.

709
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:48,870
Speaker 1: But then we're in places like New York, like a lot of places still use gas for cars, gas for cooking.

710
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are things that aren't electricity.

711
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:51,935
Speaker 1: Like we're not we're not.

712
00:49:52,176 --> 00:49:55,030
Speaker 1: we're not flying two packs in an electric powered plane yet.

713
00:49:55,855 --> 00:49:56,689
Speaker 1: No, not yet.

714
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:02,490
Speaker 1: But the move to electricity, a lot of people will say that, oh, well, you're just putting the problem somewhere else.

715
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:03,289
Speaker 1: And yes, that's true.

716
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,550
Speaker 1: But we're putting the problem somewhere fungible.

717
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:15,810
Speaker 1: Once everything is powered by electricity, we can have very hard conversations about exactly how that electricity is generated.

718
00:50:16,352 --> 00:50:19,909
Speaker 0: But also how much efficiency is lost by converting everything all the time.

719
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,068
Speaker 0: Like those extra conversion layers or how much electricity is lost on power lines, just you know, moving itself.

720
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,416
Speaker 1: And that's the that's the.

721
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:30,870
Speaker 1: there's a whole complicated space we got to deal with there.

722
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:38,730
Speaker 1: But I would like to see a future where bulk computing that's being done for the benefit of society could somehow be hardest.

723
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:48,150
Speaker 1: Like imagine if the heat in your house came from the computers in your house, that when you're not using them, they're trying to make vaccines on their own.

724
00:50:48,693 --> 00:50:50,570
Speaker 0: But also the opposite is true, right?

725
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:57,249
Speaker 0: How many places on earth are people using like, you know, those dangerous shower heads that use electricity to heat the water?

726
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,370
Speaker 0: If they're not set up properly, they can just, you know, kill you.

727
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,710
Speaker 1: I've used those shower heads before.

728
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,750
Speaker 1: They're fucking terrifying.

729
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:03,724
Speaker 0: Right.

730
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:10,550
Speaker 0: But all of those could just be doing computing and heating the water at the same time with the same amount of energy.

731
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:23,110
Speaker 1: What if everyone's house had like the furnace in your house was basically a bunch of futuristic GPUs doing cloud computing, like doing computing to make the world a better place because it wastes the same amount of electricity.

732
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:30,950
Speaker 1: The argument you could make is that a space heater that's not doing calculations is unethical.

733
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, it goes both ways, right?

734
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:37,070
Speaker 0: It's like you're doing calculations for no purpose, like making bitcoins.

735
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:43,370
Speaker 0: You're just wasting electricity and generating heat and burning, you know, the earth, setting it on fire, quite literally.

736
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:51,429
Speaker 0: Also, if you just are using electricity to just heat something only, it is just like an electric water kettle to make tea, right?

737
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:52,770
Speaker 0: Which you have, right?

738
00:51:53,254 --> 00:51:54,910
Speaker 1: What if that water kettle was a little AI?

739
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:05,709
Speaker 0: That energy could have heated the water and done math and still heated up the water pretty much without losing, you know, really much difference at all.

740
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:11,410
Speaker 1: Now, of course, material science, mining of rare earth minerals to make those devices, this gets complex.

741
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:12,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, to make all those chips.

742
00:52:12,794 --> 00:52:13,048
Speaker 0: Yeah.

743
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:15,690
Speaker 0: It's like, is that worth it to make all those chips everywhere?

744
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:17,841
Speaker 0: Also, up in the... To heat up water, you need two nodes.

745
00:52:19,151 --> 00:52:27,406
Speaker 1: In that 1940s era apartment building in New York City, the GPU boiler has a bug in it because one of the chips failed, like...

746
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,229
Speaker 0: Cyberpunk?

747
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:29,796
Speaker 1: Yup.

748
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,767
Speaker 1: So I guess the only thing we could... We'll wrap this up.

749
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:42,049
Speaker 1: If you're in technology, in computing in particular, your individual action in terms of the code you write is not really going to matter unless you are...

750
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:45,150
Speaker 0: Unless the code you write is running on a large, large system.

751
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:50,230
Speaker 1: Which is increasingly accessible to people who have enough money because of cloud.

752
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:59,789
Speaker 1: Like, I could... Scott and I could pay to spin up massive cloud networks to burn... Just to burn money into bitcoins if we wanted to.

753
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:02,210
Speaker 1: We're not gonna, because we're not evil.

754
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:15,648
Speaker 1: So if you are in a position... If you're in a job where these sorts of issues come up and someone raises these ethical concerns, my advice to you is amplify their voices and support them.

755
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:21,709
Speaker 1: So we don't have another situation where someone like Timnit Gebru gets drummed out of Google for saying the truth.

756
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:23,030
Speaker 0: That's right.

757
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:27,190
Speaker 0: Don't be... It's like if this comes up, first of all, if it's not, come up.

758
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,090
Speaker 0: Bring it up, right?

759
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:43,050
Speaker 0: If you think that you work somewhere that has huge computing systems that are using lots of energy and no one really cares about how much energy they make, they just... It's like, you know, you should support like, hey, making your code more efficient could actually help the earth, right?

760
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:50,450
Speaker 0: Or, hey, is the thing that we're doing with all this energy worth doing if it does this much damage to the earth?

761
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,328
Speaker 0: Maybe we just shouldn't do this business at all or find some other way to do it.

762
00:53:55,871 --> 00:53:59,710
Speaker 0: But yeah, if someone else brings up the concerns, you should join with them.

763
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,990
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be all like, yeah, just poo-pooing, ignoring, whatever.

764
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:06,825
Speaker 0: Which is what seems to be mostly happening with the coin.

765
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:09,589
Speaker 0: conversation is people are just like, yeah, it's true.

766
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:10,367
Speaker 0: We know.

767
00:54:11,074 --> 00:54:12,870
Speaker 0: I don't see a lot of people disputing it, right?

768
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:13,769
Speaker 0: It's like it's the truth.

769
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:14,949
Speaker 0: Like Bitcoin?

770
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,870
Speaker 0: Irrespective of everything else wrong with it.

771
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:17,364
Speaker 1: What you gonna do?

772
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:18,204
Speaker 1: Bitcoin?

773
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,249
Speaker 0: What you gonna do about it?

774
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,606
Speaker 0: We know.

775
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:27,990
Speaker 1: I literally think Bitcoin should like that kind of computing for those purposes should be banned for its carbon footprint alone.

776
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:37,030
Speaker 0: And I'm not against the idea of, you know, a currency that is digital and I'm not against the idea of a distributed self-signing system.

777
00:54:38,052 --> 00:54:38,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not the.

778
00:54:38,978 --> 00:54:40,650
Speaker 0: those aren't the reasons I'm anti-coin.

779
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:41,808
Speaker 1: I'm anti-coin.

780
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,769
Speaker 0: I'm anti-coin because it's not a currency.

781
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:45,369
Speaker 0: It's just a Fonzie scheme.

782
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:48,230
Speaker 0: And also it's burning the earth on fire.

783
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:50,550
Speaker 0: If you change those two things, I'd probably be pro-coin.

784
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:56,350
Speaker 1: Large scale proof of work where you burn computing cycles to prove that you are a part of it.

785
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,990
Speaker 1: Like that is a fundamental pattern that needs to be stamped out globally.

786
00:55:02,112 --> 00:55:03,280
Speaker 1: We should treat that the same way.

787
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,750
Speaker 1: we treat things like nuclear weapons.

788
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,690
Speaker 1: Like, yes, that exists and you're not allowed to use it.

789
00:55:07,832 --> 00:55:08,488
Speaker 1: And here's why.

790
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,710
Speaker 0: Yes, you can't have one of those in your house.

791
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:12,708
Speaker 0: It's a bazooka.

792
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,589
Speaker 0: It's not for normal people to have.

793
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:15,070
Speaker 1: Yeah.

794
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:19,664
Speaker 1: Hopefully someday we'll get to the point where no one has a military needs to do it for some reason.

795
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:22,250
Speaker 0: I guess it can because it's also the government.

796
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:24,249
Speaker 0: It can get away with it, but they shouldn't be doing it.

797
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:26,170
Speaker 1: But also the military.

798
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:27,433
Speaker 1: Here's the U.S.

799
00:55:27,453 --> 00:55:33,590
Speaker 1: military has recognized for a long time, very openly, that climate change is one of the biggest threats to American security.

800
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,108
Speaker 0: Like they know that it is one of their job is to think about it is.

801
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:40,529
Speaker 0: And it is one of the biggest contributors to said climate change.

802
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,066
Speaker 0: Yes.

803
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,290
Speaker 0: You know, jet that uses a shit ton of fuel.

804
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:45,998
Speaker 1: And so arguably the U.S.

805
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:55,084
Speaker 1: military should be focusing very hard on reducing its own carbon footprint, because that reduces the likelihood of a war that the military will be necessary for.

806
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:56,927
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

807
00:55:57,672 --> 00:56:04,310
Speaker 1: So, yeah, just if nothing else, like think about this stuff like RIT made us to at least take a few classes on like like ethics and technology.

808
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,510
Speaker 0: I took literally every single class that was available.

809
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:12,150
Speaker 0: That was something along the lines of technology and society or whatever.

810
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:17,358
Speaker 0: I took every single one that was offered while I was there with the credits that I had to take.

811
00:56:23,143 --> 00:56:25,260
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

812
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,419
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando Kay for the logos.

813
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,820
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our Web site at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

814
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,740
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

815
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:43,460
Speaker 1: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

817
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,300
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

818
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,440
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

819
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:31,800
Speaker 1: Dread Lily Tenebrae, just like a dude guy, Chris Reimer, Finn, Shervin Von Harl and a bunch of people, including someone who's giving us four dollars and ninety nine cents to keep me from saying their name.

820
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,259
Speaker 1: Uh, we almost had some trouble putting the show up, but thankfully Google's bandwidth issues seem to have calmed down.

821
00:57:38,742 --> 00:57:42,780
Speaker 1: If you heard any robot noises during the live stream, I can at least say that that is not in this recording.

822
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,318
Speaker 1: Stay safe out there.

823
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:49,899
Speaker 1: And now I leave you with... What can I do for you, mister?

824
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:52,960
Speaker 0: Tell me how to reach the famous Baxter Building.

825
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,560
Speaker 1: It's a long way from here.

826
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:56,099
Speaker 1: You'd better get some gas.

827
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,477
Speaker 0: Nobody tells me what to do.

828
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,539
Speaker 0: Besides, fuel is for lesser men.

829
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,219
Speaker 0: My vehicle needs no gas.

830
00:58:04,821 --> 00:58:05,837
Speaker 1: You're putting me on.

831
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:07,878
Speaker 0: Every car needs gas.

832
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:10,299
Speaker 0: You witless young fool.

833
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,879
Speaker 0: This is not every car.

834
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,479
Speaker 0: And nobody may dare contradict me.

835
00:58:16,183 --> 00:58:18,940
Speaker 0: For when they do, I get angry.

836
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,919
Speaker 0: When I get angry, things begin to happen.

837
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:23,945
Speaker 1: No!

838
00:58:28,162 --> 00:58:29,259
Speaker 1: Now it's impossible!

839
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,200
Speaker 0: To me, nothing is impossible.

840
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,800
Speaker 0: I can do anything.

841
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:37,558
Speaker 1: And if you still don't believe me... I believe you!

842
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:38,558
Speaker 1: I believe you!

843
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:39,498
Speaker 1: No more!

844
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,520
Speaker 1: Please no more!

845
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:41,277
Speaker 1: I believe you!

846
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:45,939
Speaker 1: Then stand aside, for I grow bored with this charade.

847
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,619
Speaker 0: How simple it is to fill the hearts of men with fear.

848
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:52,840
Speaker 1: I have carried long enough.

849
00:58:53,460 --> 00:59:02,158
Speaker 1: I must not waste my power on others when it is time for the Fantastic Four to tremble before the menace of Magneto.
