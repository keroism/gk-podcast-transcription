Speaker 0: avatar Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:32,322
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about your man pack for the opening But this is not an open.

6
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:36,368
Speaker 1: your Scott decided He wants his man pack to be the thing of the day not my man pack.

7
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:37,232
Speaker 1: well Not yet.

8
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,898
Speaker 1: apparently it should be your man now.

9
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,728
Speaker 1: It's man packs and apparently you need some.

10
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:42,410
Speaker 0: no I don't.

11
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:47,670
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, this is what happens when we don't actually have anything interesting.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,866
Speaker 1: I mean all I have to talk about that's meta that I could actually talk about.

13
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:54,702
Speaker 1: on the show is Stuff like the fat woman that prevented me from catching the train.

14
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:55,425
Speaker 1: I wanted to catch.

15
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:56,670
Speaker 0: I had an opening bit.

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,044
Speaker 0: I just forgot what it was and I had a second opening bit that I moved to news.

17
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,298
Speaker 0: and because I forgot the first opening Bit and then I you know well now what.

18
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:07,596
Speaker 1: oh yeah, well, I worry if I keep bringing up like in the in the morning You know every couple weeks.

19
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,230
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, this fat woman got in my way.

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,142
Speaker 1: It sounds like I'm just I don't know like I'm attracted to fat women.

21
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:18,466
Speaker 1: or somehow fat women are like Central to my life, maybe a confirmation so large you can't not notice them.

22
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:20,593
Speaker 1: They have some sort of Gravitation.

23
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:21,440
Speaker 0: why is it always women?

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:21,863
Speaker 0: Why are there?

25
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:22,649
Speaker 0: you know fat dudes?

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:23,932
Speaker 1: There are.

27
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:26,166
Speaker 1: it's just they're never in my way on the escalator ever.

28
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:27,573
Speaker 1: hmm I don't know why.

29
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:31,110
Speaker 1: I don't think there's any difference between fat men and fat women.

30
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,214
Speaker 0: It's just except there.

31
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:36,064
Speaker 0: You know their ability to use an escalator quickly.

32
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:38,413
Speaker 1: I don't know but it You know.

33
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:42,510
Speaker 1: maybe I'll end this because today like for the fifth time I see the seven train coming.

34
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:49,475
Speaker 1: I'm going down this long escalator But I usually just walk down like every commuter does and there's one we just blocking the whole escalator and I'm standing behind her.

35
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:57,030
Speaker 1: I see the train come and then go and Then we get to the bottom of the escalator, and I stand there for like 10 minutes to wait for another train.

36
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,620
Speaker 1: I think next time I'm just going for it.

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,069
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna like jump up on the rail and run past her.

38
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:07,030
Speaker 0: I remembered what my other opening bit was what I was talking about five minutes ago.

39
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,297
Speaker 0: Which is I considering?

40
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:09,543
Speaker 0: removing all hairs.

41
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,613
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, well What I don't see.

42
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,817
Speaker 0: the proud the thing is here.

43
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:16,550
Speaker 0: the pro is the pro con rundown ready pro number one.

44
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:21,583
Speaker 0: I like less maintenance and not having any hairs you get the cool breeze.

45
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,130
Speaker 0: ah it's much easier to wear hats and helmets.

46
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:36,530
Speaker 1: I will say this right I don't plan to ever really cut my long hair But I have these vague memories of what it feels like to have short hair like I can imagine Like when I was like a great weight has been lifted.

47
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,659
Speaker 0: It's like a thousand million cross.

48
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,029
Speaker 0: Oh, it's cried out, and we're suddenly silence.

49
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:48,107
Speaker 0: No, okay, so the right now the thing is right is my hair actually right now.

50
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:48,870
Speaker 0: It looks all right.

51
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:52,203
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with it except if there's a camera.

52
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:52,806
Speaker 0: right.

53
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:58,236
Speaker 0: it looks like I'm diseased The way cameras pick up.

54
00:02:58,276 --> 00:02:58,618
Speaker 1: especially.

55
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:05,850
Speaker 1: I think this camera in particular does some sort of color correction Like if you get the top of my head you can see this line down the top like when I have my hair tied back.

56
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:13,145
Speaker 0: No, they're like some pictures They saw of me on the Internet's where it looks like I have some you know like cancer or whatever And I'm like it doesn't look too.

57
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:14,373
Speaker 1: Good see now I'm thinking you.

58
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:15,979
Speaker 1: your options are one.

59
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,870
Speaker 1: keep it because you are primed for Aramaki hair.

60
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:24,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the problem is Aramaki hair only looks good when you're old and gray which I have not me.

61
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,649
Speaker 0: I could do an Aramaki cosplay and then shave it up.

62
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,655
Speaker 1: Maybe you should.

63
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:33,390
Speaker 1: you have to grow that you throw out a little bit on the side.

64
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:37,264
Speaker 0: Well the problem is is the sides are basically the same as they always were.

65
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,688
Speaker 0: they're exactly the way the top used to be But the top is not what it once was.

66
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,412
Speaker 1: well Here's the trouble.

67
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:46,588
Speaker 1: Aramaki hair is awesome, but between Aramaki hair and current hair is clown hair.

68
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,170
Speaker 0: exactly.

69
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,394
Speaker 0: This is another problem.

70
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:48,756
Speaker 0: right?

71
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:58,740
Speaker 0: is that if you if I shave it all off, and I let it grow back It's basically gonna be horrible in these in the in-between Stages as it comes back in.

72
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:05,149
Speaker 1: the next option is what one of my co-workers at IBM Did and he was you know he'd lost his hair kind of early in the same pattern you did But he still had the sides.

73
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:16,940
Speaker 1: He just kept the top to the bitter end and eventually at all the middle in the top went away And he had like trimmed a clown hair And it worked like a Costanza situation.

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,988
Speaker 1: yeah, it was basically a kiss man, that's not good.

75
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,540
Speaker 1: The other option is just to go all out.

76
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,816
Speaker 1: the trouble with all out is you do not know what the shape of your head Is remember Adam?

77
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,793
Speaker 0: It's not so much the shape of the head I'm worried about.

78
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:33,155
Speaker 0: what I'm worried about is some other factors such as You know You know it's sort of.

79
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,086
Speaker 0: first of all it's like a one-way street sort of.

80
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:39,270
Speaker 0: it's like if I go There's no turning back, so if it was the bad you know I don't like to do anything.

81
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:41,188
Speaker 0: I can't undo if I don't have to write.

82
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,920
Speaker 0: Secondly there's the the situation of.

83
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:50,677
Speaker 0: I was reading on the Internet's of course for help with this you know The situation of the pale scalp.

84
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:51,299
Speaker 0: right.

85
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,997
Speaker 0: so basically in that yeah, but I mean immediately right I have to go outside.

86
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,748
Speaker 0: You know the same day makeup.

87
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:03,559
Speaker 0: So It's like you go outside And you're gonna have this strangely colored head.

88
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,048
Speaker 1: Scott there are two optional three out for a couple days.

89
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,860
Speaker 1: makeup Baseball cap awesome hat.

90
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,230
Speaker 1: this would be an opportunity to start wearing like fedoras.

91
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,473
Speaker 0: Well, I definitely there's gonna be hats whether I have hairs or not You know there's.

92
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:20,014
Speaker 0: I'm definitely good because you know you'll find in my news I will discuss helmets.

93
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,790
Speaker 0: you know of course the bicycle variety which are for a guy guarantee.

94
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,682
Speaker 0: They're far more comfortable, and you have less hairs.

95
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:26,930
Speaker 0: because you look at Lance Armstrong.

96
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:35,170
Speaker 0: He doesn't be fucking hairs right yeah, and then Captain Jean-Luc Picard also no hairs right sexiest man alive.

97
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,820
Speaker 0: So you're already done with Neil Gaiman.

98
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:39,750
Speaker 1: Neil Gaiman has all game.

99
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,594
Speaker 1: It has kind of this.

100
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,824
Speaker 0: there was a Neil Gaiman house tour video.

101
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,190
Speaker 0: I saw the Internet's recently.

102
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,109
Speaker 1: He has this kind of roguish Britishness that I really like, but at the same time Patrick Stewart has command.

103
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:54,124
Speaker 0: Uh-huh so rim you like to you like to be taking command of.

104
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:58,236
Speaker 1: is that what you're saying if it's a Starship captain of the USS Enterprise?

105
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,804
Speaker 0: so Emily taking command of rim is the hella good.

106
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:02,889
Speaker 1: Emily does not look like Patrick Stewart.

107
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,729
Speaker 0: I Don't think she's gonna shave her head.

108
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:11,846
Speaker 1: Well, I mean remember Adam went through the exact same debate you went through and he was in a.

109
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:15,166
Speaker 0: but yeah He was in a. he was in a worse situation than I'm at now.

110
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,157
Speaker 0: if I was him I would have I would have gone over.

111
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:21,118
Speaker 0: you know if I was at his at the point at which he went for it I would have gone for it way before.

112
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:23,190
Speaker 0: yeah, but I'm not yet at the line.

113
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,770
Speaker 1: But the debate was you know what if you have a funny-shaped head?

114
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,232
Speaker 1: What if there's?

115
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,617
Speaker 1: the other question is right.

116
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,581
Speaker 0: you look right.

117
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,990
Speaker 0: one of my grandpa's you know my dad's dad.

118
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 0: You know when I had all baldness just like my dad and crazy baldness right, but my mom's dad It thinned and then it stopped right.

119
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,683
Speaker 0: so it's like I could.

120
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:42,887
Speaker 0: it could be like this.

121
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:43,890
Speaker 0: it is now forever.

122
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:45,214
Speaker 0: It's possible.

123
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:48,544
Speaker 0: It could just like reach this point, and I could be 80 with the same exact thing.

124
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:49,105
Speaker 0: I got now.

125
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:50,369
Speaker 0: I don't know.

126
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:51,897
Speaker 0: It's guy.

127
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,494
Speaker 1: it's like yeah history I don't know what I would do.

128
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,443
Speaker 1: you could try to get someone to photoshop you bald.

129
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:57,508
Speaker 0: that's I was.

130
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:05,159
Speaker 1: I Requested that a few times But you might have to start wearing like tiny little sunglasses because you could rock that look Maybe like the tiny little red sunglasses.

131
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,566
Speaker 0: I already bought expensive sunglasses.

132
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:07,410
Speaker 0: I'm not buying them again.

133
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:18,066
Speaker 1: No, you're wearing the expensive sunglasses when there's actually Sun where the other sunglasses all the time and don't actually look through Like the time because they look good bald guy with like tiny red spectacles.

134
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:23,029
Speaker 0: That's a pain in the ass Yeah, but it's a good idea is to reduce the pain in the ass, but it's a good look.

135
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:24,236
Speaker 0: I don't care.

136
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:26,209
Speaker 0: beauty before duty no.

137
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,003
Speaker 1: Fashion before function no.

138
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,059
Speaker 1: So I don't know what you should do.

139
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,649
Speaker 0: I don't know anyway.

140
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,998
Speaker 0: No No So I already talked about my news a little bit.

141
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:46,203
Speaker 0: might as look all the way right.

142
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:47,730
Speaker 1: so something about bicycle helmets.

143
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:51,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, no no it's just that if I was bald a bicycle helmet would be comfortable.

144
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:58,110
Speaker 1: You know more comfortable than if I had half the reason I never wear helmets when I ski or bike or anything is because I hate putting my hair under the skiing helmets.

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,750
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone wear a skiing home here, but it's not really a bad idea.

146
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,975
Speaker 0: How do you think about it now?

147
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:05,830
Speaker 1: actually all studies show that skiing helmets have in no way?

148
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,140
Speaker 1: Decreased the number of fatalities skiing.

149
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,934
Speaker 0: that's cuz most of it as true But it would reduce I guess.

150
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,803
Speaker 0: hey the primary the thing is skiing.

151
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:16,594
Speaker 0: head injuries are kind of rare even if you go completely Unprotected.

152
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,809
Speaker 0: it's mostly limb injuries actually.

153
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:19,393
Speaker 1: no It's not.

154
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:26,386
Speaker 1: and back it's primarily neck injuries if you're not wearing a helmet Or if you are wearing a helmet head injuries if you it's a head if you're not wearing.

155
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:37,282
Speaker 1: if you are wearing a helmet Whatever whatever regardless the point is the reason the helmets don't matter is because the primary factor in how severely you hurt yourself is The severity of the accident and almost nothing else has any effect.

156
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:47,328
Speaker 1: only three types of people wear helmets skiing Wuses snowboarders doing tricks and people skiing either in crazy hard stuff or ice and the latter two you should be wearing a helmet.

157
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:48,250
Speaker 0: who skis?

158
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,501
Speaker 0: and crazy hard stuff and ice?

159
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:52,972
Speaker 1: a lot of people I'll.

160
00:08:53,052 --> 00:09:00,590
Speaker 1: in fact if I'm skiing on like a black diamond, and there's like straight-up ice I'll wear a helmet because I don't want to fall and hit my head on what I would wear a helmet on the ski jump.

161
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:06,225
Speaker 1: Ski jump actually not that dangerous compared to say it's really not as good thing is.

162
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:07,469
Speaker 0: it looks a lot higher on TV.

163
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:09,297
Speaker 0: Then it is in real life.

164
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,129
Speaker 0: You know it's not actually that high pretty high.

165
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,800
Speaker 0: Well the thing is is like it's got you go skiing.

166
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,914
Speaker 1: I do like a four-foot jump and holy shit Ski jump is not that high.

167
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:21,538
Speaker 0: ah it's it's less.

168
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:22,881
Speaker 0: It's like high dive high.

169
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,245
Speaker 0: It's not you know like.

170
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:27,432
Speaker 0: it's not like bungee jump high It's.

171
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,164
Speaker 0: I want to see a ski jump this bungee jump high.

172
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,030
Speaker 0: that'd be fucking awesome.

173
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,881
Speaker 1: There are people who do stuff like that.

174
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:33,129
Speaker 0: no, but I want to see that in the Olympics.

175
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:37,839
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway skid bicycling.

176
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,330
Speaker 0: so I've been looking at buying some bicycles.

177
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:44,170
Speaker 0: I've seen a few I got but the thing is I was gonna go actually like pick one up like tomorrow.

178
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:48,110
Speaker 0: You go you know just go to two or three different places until I found what I wanted.

179
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,218
Speaker 0: It's gonna rain like from now until whenever.

180
00:09:51,258 --> 00:10:01,350
Speaker 0: so I was like well if you're delaying my my action here until forever Yeah, and my but my work You know there's a New York law about they have to let you bring a bike in the freight elevators.

181
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:09,904
Speaker 0: You know basically because if I had to leave the bike on the street I would not ride my bike to work At least not a bike that cost more than five dollars you buy one of those hipster fixies.

182
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,775
Speaker 0: not gonna happen fixies I can't even ride a fixie.

183
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,210
Speaker 1: fixies are only useful for two kinds of people old people little kids.

184
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:18,428
Speaker 1: No, I guess the third option kids.

185
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:24,908
Speaker 1: It's people who want biking to be horrifyingly painful and difficult and people who don't know how to use a real bike.

186
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:30,427
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually I saw someone sent me a link over to a bike that I was like.

187
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,984
Speaker 0: I can't get that bike It's a fixie, but actually what it has?

188
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,293
Speaker 0: it has Internal gears.

189
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,598
Speaker 1: those are your hub.

190
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,043
Speaker 1: those aren't really fixies.

191
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:44,405
Speaker 0: my dad at a bike has a planetary You know sort of gear system in the hub and then the the you know the.

192
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:45,770
Speaker 0: you don't have a derailleur.

193
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,453
Speaker 0: You know the bike.

194
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:47,317
Speaker 1: yeah, those are great.

195
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,428
Speaker 1: They're basically zero maintenance, and you get three gears.

196
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:49,730
Speaker 1: They're great.

197
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,483
Speaker 1: They're like what only there was one with seven years seven.

198
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, holy shit, right?

199
00:10:54,091 --> 00:11:01,050
Speaker 0: But anyway this goes back to my news Which is that the at the the something hours of adrenaline solo world?

200
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,769
Speaker 0: Championship is a grueling showcase for the world's toughest bikes and such and such.

201
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:09,425
Speaker 0: It's in Canada and is dude a 37 year old firefighter right?

202
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:12,374
Speaker 0: he won the single speed division So basically the fixie division.

203
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,280
Speaker 0: on a bike with no chain.

204
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:22,549
Speaker 0: it had a belt a car a belt Just like a timing belt in a car a rubber belt, and I didn't even really know that it's like.

205
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:27,370
Speaker 0: well Why not do that, but so it was like one of those obvious ideas just no one had done until recently.

206
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,910
Speaker 0: And the thing that's interesting about the belt right is that obviously you don't have a derailleur.

207
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,317
Speaker 0: So if you want gears you have to use the.

208
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:44,390
Speaker 0: you know the planetary in hub system all right and to Know that when you usually ride a bike with you know a chain and gears right there's that catch.

209
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:49,807
Speaker 0: It's like you'll move the pedals like forward like you know a half a centimeter before the spikes on the gear.

210
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,730
Speaker 0: catch the chain.

211
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,818
Speaker 0: You know that the spike will be in between two links.

212
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,030
Speaker 0: You know so you don't get feedback immediately.

213
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:57,457
Speaker 0: It yet you have to catch.

214
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:59,909
Speaker 0: you know of course the thing with that with a with a belt.

215
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:03,164
Speaker 0: You move the pedal and it immediately starts moving.

216
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,210
Speaker 0: It's like an exercise bike.

217
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,998
Speaker 0: It's like vroom, and it's like whoa.

218
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:11,987
Speaker 1: but on most bike races especially long distance You're basically gonna work your way up to the high gear and then not come off of it.

219
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:13,905
Speaker 1: most of the time You're not gonna be changing gears that often.

220
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:14,812
Speaker 0: well It could be.

221
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:17,948
Speaker 0: if it's Tour de France and the hilly parts you're gonna be changing the gear.

222
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:21,090
Speaker 0: yeah If it's the flats you're not changing shit.

223
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,805
Speaker 1: I don't know how much of an impact that would make in the long run.

224
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,051
Speaker 1: it depends on the kind of race I guess.

225
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:33,470
Speaker 0: yeah, the thing is having gears at all whether they're internal or you know derailleur gears You know there makes a huge fucking difference.

226
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:33,831
Speaker 0: You know the.

227
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:39,830
Speaker 0: when they invented the derailleur this lady with three gears beat like the world champions of biking who had one gear.

228
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:49,990
Speaker 0: You know in this bike race in Italy and that's where they are that's when everyone realized the gears are worthwhile Those people on the big stupid ha ha ha bikes too, and she was on a small bike.

229
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,129
Speaker 0: I don't know if they were on the ha ha ha bikes.

230
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,896
Speaker 1: I think they were on the ha ha bikes.

231
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:57,870
Speaker 0: the point is is that gears beats no gears, right?

232
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a paper-rock-scissors situation.

233
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:01,670
Speaker 0: these belts are interesting.

234
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,816
Speaker 0: I think that you know in.

235
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:05,470
Speaker 0: you know it's a long ways out before we see gears.

236
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:08,710
Speaker 0: You know the belts not the key the belts being for serious.

237
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,538
Speaker 0: But right now it's like you can buy that.

238
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,010
Speaker 0: there's a trek makes a bike called the Soho that has the belt.

239
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,458
Speaker 0: Actually saw it in the store.

240
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,450
Speaker 0: It was pretty interesting, but I would not buy it now.

241
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,273
Speaker 1: I wouldn't bother with it.

242
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,250
Speaker 1: a standard like 21 speed bike is gonna be fine.

243
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:23,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, but you know I mean bike technology is so good.

244
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:25,270
Speaker 1: you buy a crapo Huffy.

245
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:29,990
Speaker 1: It's almost as good as my real mountain bike just as my real mountain bikes like 13 years old.

246
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm done with the mountain bikes now.

247
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,022
Speaker 0: I'm in the city.

248
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:32,786
Speaker 0: I get a city bike.

249
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:39,156
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm keeping my mountain bike for now, but I might buy a hybrid or a street bike Mmm.

250
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:40,062
Speaker 1: You're looking at a hybrid.

251
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,110
Speaker 1: I think I'm going straight up street.

252
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,516
Speaker 1: Tiny tiny wheels.

253
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,589
Speaker 0: well see the thing is what I'm looking at is technically not a hybrid.

254
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,810
Speaker 0: right?

255
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,437
Speaker 0: I mean you look the hybrids are like.

256
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:54,061
Speaker 0: you know when you go to the bike websites if you click hybrid it shows one Kind of bike, but that's not the kind of bike that shows.

257
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:57,176
Speaker 0: if I click on like city slash commuter It shows a different kind.

258
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,468
Speaker 0: you know it's basically like.

259
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:05,109
Speaker 0: the bikes I'm looking at are like structured like a mountain bike But they don't have suspensions or anything like that.

260
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,374
Speaker 0: You know at all.

261
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,662
Speaker 1: because you really want a front suspension on any bike.

262
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:12,837
Speaker 0: no front suspension slows you the hell down Is just annoying.

263
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:16,699
Speaker 1: front suspension slows you down only a tiny bit But it greatly increases your top speed.

264
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,890
Speaker 1: it makes a lot easier over curbs and traffic and things.

265
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,910
Speaker 0: I'm not interested in a suspension.

266
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,653
Speaker 1: That's a mistake.

267
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:36,608
Speaker 1: front what you don't want is a middle or rear suspension or a body suspension because those Kill your speed unless you spend crazy money on one of the special ones that has like this vertical stabilizer that Locks it when you're doing the fours and unlocks it when the ground is doing the phone.

268
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:45,247
Speaker 0: now everything I have checked suggest that a Suspension is no help in the city if you're just on roads all the time if you're on perfectly flat straight roads Which is New York City?

269
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,210
Speaker 0: Anyway the other thing is that they're basically you know they're they're just mountain bikes.

270
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,700
Speaker 0: But they had you know with like.

271
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,110
Speaker 0: you know a whole bunch of gears.

272
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:56,739
Speaker 0: But the tires are not.

273
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,790
Speaker 0: you know all nubbly mountain bike tires.

274
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,616
Speaker 0: They are you know like.

275
00:15:00,756 --> 00:15:01,880
Speaker 0: you know they're not like they're not.

276
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,021
Speaker 0: they're not the super narrow Tour de France tires You know like honest for a road bike.

277
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,247
Speaker 0: They're a little wider than that.

278
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:08,970
Speaker 0: They're like 700.

279
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,340
Speaker 0: I think they call them like 700 CC tires.

280
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:13,770
Speaker 0: You know and they're looking pretty nice.

281
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,674
Speaker 0: I think that's what I need.

282
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,810
Speaker 0: and there's you know every manufacturer has at least one or two bikes in this category.

283
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,139
Speaker 0: So I just got to go.

284
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:24,320
Speaker 0: see what's out there check the prices See what the shops in town actually have available.

285
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,910
Speaker 1: so I guess my thinking is just that I already have a mountain bike.

286
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:37,324
Speaker 1: So since that's a specialized tool if I buy another bike and keep the old one I should get one that is specialized for city only Like crazy speed bike the ones that weigh like an ounce and have tiny wheels.

287
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,650
Speaker 1: yeah, I can't deal with a pebble.

288
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:40,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the problem.

289
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:45,809
Speaker 0: is you know you that that's a very all well and good But it's not good for going to work every day.

290
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:54,559
Speaker 1: I'd probably go because if I go to work I'm just gonna be in the street You know going over the bridge and then going down like I don't know what's what Avenue or Street I'd take to get there to figure that out.

291
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,706
Speaker 1: find a bike lane now.

292
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:56,410
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised.

293
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,703
Speaker 0: I've been reading like you know people who own like five.

294
00:15:58,723 --> 00:15:59,970
Speaker 0: you know huge bike people.

295
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,210
Speaker 0: I've been reading lots of blogs and reviews, and you don't want to take like a real road bike to work.

296
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,377
Speaker 0: It's not the best idea.

297
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:09,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the trouble is plus some of the bikes I'm looking at way like fucking nothing.

298
00:16:10,298 --> 00:16:10,579
Speaker 0: I picked.

299
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:11,723
Speaker 0: I went in the store.

300
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:12,205
Speaker 0: There was one.

301
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:13,450
Speaker 0: It was four hundred something dollars.

302
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:14,094
Speaker 0: I picked it up.

303
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:19,001
Speaker 0: it weighed like less than half of any bike I've ever ridden in my life, and it was just normal bike.

304
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,770
Speaker 1: It's great when technology advances like that.

305
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, so I guess I do have a little bit of news though I actually I had the stupid ustream thing up.

306
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,709
Speaker 1: so now I gotta I gotta find my news again.

307
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:32,304
Speaker 1: All right, so Felix Ortiz.

308
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:33,709
Speaker 1: He's a Democrat from Brooklyn.

309
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,904
Speaker 1: now We don't talk about politics on this level that often on geek nights.

310
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:46,730
Speaker 1: I Thought I should bring this guy up because it's just so crazy Like it's very rare that a politician will surprise me with the level of like craziness that they put forth.

311
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:56,550
Speaker 1: He is arguing that what we should do is Ban the use of all forms of salt in the preparation and cooking of food in all restaurants and bakeries.

312
00:16:57,413 --> 00:16:59,007
Speaker 0: Wait all salt period.

313
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:01,298
Speaker 1: now I don't think he was like the size.

314
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,603
Speaker 1: ban what kind of salt.

315
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:03,005
Speaker 1: I mean?

316
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,310
Speaker 1: our salts of mercury.

317
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,765
Speaker 1: Okay, is it just sodium chloride?

318
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:07,450
Speaker 1: What about MSG?

319
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,941
Speaker 1: Never mind the fact that he just see you.

320
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,270
Speaker 0: so he wants to use the word salt.

321
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,602
Speaker 1: That's sodium chloride as far as I can tell basically.

322
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:16,808
Speaker 0: He doesn't realize that.

323
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,109
Speaker 0: you know.

324
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:20,938
Speaker 0: Iodized salt is a necessary nutrient to all.

325
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,205
Speaker 1: small iodine is the necessary nutrient.

326
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,530
Speaker 0: yes, and you're gonna get it in salt.

327
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,646
Speaker 1: Are you gonna get a goiter?

328
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,848
Speaker 1: But apparently it's a reaction to this move to.

329
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:32,338
Speaker 1: you know The fat tax to tax soda and things like that.

330
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,164
Speaker 1: and he was saying let's go one step further.

331
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:35,890
Speaker 1: salt causes crazy health problems.

332
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,169
Speaker 1: He leaves out the fact in people who eat too much salt.

333
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need salt.

334
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,851
Speaker 0: the problem is too much of it I think.

335
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:53,787
Speaker 0: I think that a regulation on like sodium content per you know would be okay if it was a Regulation that was devised by say the FDA or if they did what I mean New York.

336
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:54,610
Speaker 1: I think it was brilliant.

337
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,032
Speaker 1: We didn't?

338
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:57,842
Speaker 1: we legislated something that was obvious like trans fat.

339
00:17:57,882 --> 00:17:58,424
Speaker 1: We said all right.

340
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:03,910
Speaker 1: No fucking trans fat stop it That's fine, but we didn't regulate a lot of other things like calories.

341
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,122
Speaker 1: We didn't say those donuts can't have more than 400 calories.

342
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:10,682
Speaker 0: said you had to write the number of calories down So I could see how much is in the dough.

343
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,470
Speaker 1: not just write it down You have to put it like right there like next to the price.

344
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,810
Speaker 1: You can't just like hide it like McDonald's used to do and that little pamphlet that no one read.

345
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:22,890
Speaker 0: I took my parents to the to the Pong Quo Tien where they had all the you know the calories.

346
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:24,076
Speaker 1: I love that place.

347
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,710
Speaker 0: I said the calories on the menu went there today for the baguette.

348
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,814
Speaker 1: Oh how the baguette.

349
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:33,564
Speaker 0: they and they saw the calories on the menu right and my mom was like oh my god The sandwich is 600 calories.

350
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,848
Speaker 0: I'm like yeah You see how small that sandwich is you go to eat at a restaurant in Connecticut where they don't list the calories?

351
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:39,230
Speaker 0: think about how?

352
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,695
Speaker 0: Many that is.

353
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,131
Speaker 0: it's probably like 1500.

354
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:48,130
Speaker 1: I remember when they when they finally put it in in Starbucks You know like when the grace period my one slice of pizza from the place around the corner from use probably as much calories.

355
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:48,854
Speaker 0: Is that sandwich?

356
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:54,000
Speaker 1: I go to stupid Starbucks, and there's this like red velvet cupcakes I used to get every now and then those things like 450 calories.

357
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,030
Speaker 1: It's tiny little cupcake.

358
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:56,834
Speaker 0: What do you think it's?

359
00:18:56,914 --> 00:19:00,010
Speaker 0: it's just friggin flour and sugar crammed in real tight.

360
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:06,869
Speaker 0: I still eat like two sometimes and then they use fire and the fire crams the sugar and the flour and even tighter All right, so yeah.

361
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:08,898
Speaker 1: But I think they should do the same thing.

362
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:14,506
Speaker 1: if sodium is such a big problem make some law that says you also have To show with certain kinds of food how much sodium is in it.

363
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,189
Speaker 1: That's fun.

364
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:17,497
Speaker 0: But I think that the you know it would.

365
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:22,845
Speaker 0: it wouldn't be too bad if the FDA just sort of regulated like okay That is too much salt for that potato chip.

366
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:23,530
Speaker 0: bring it down.

367
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe at least in prepared.

368
00:19:25,018 --> 00:19:27,330
Speaker 0: obviously banning salt is ridiculous.

369
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,895
Speaker 0: It's sort of necessary.

370
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,186
Speaker 1: what I wonder is this guy doing the smart thing like?

371
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:32,788
Speaker 1: it's hard to tell.

372
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,738
Speaker 1: I never trust Politicians when they make a crazy proposal.

373
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,104
Speaker 0: I could just be trying to get attention.

374
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:42,030
Speaker 1: is he is he honestly Suggesting that we kill the children of the poor and feed them to the rich?

375
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:45,844
Speaker 1: Or is he ironically suggesting it to point out the greater injustices.

376
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:47,350
Speaker 0: I don't know I had to talk to him.

377
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,656
Speaker 0: Why'd you call his office?

378
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:51,890
Speaker 1: I just don't trust people at all anymore.

379
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:55,401
Speaker 1: But I mean some foods require salt to make.

380
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:58,410
Speaker 0: yeah like potato chips or pickles.

381
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, you basically be a pickle ban.

382
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:05,794
Speaker 1: I Just and it's New York.

383
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:06,797
Speaker 1: There'd be riots.

384
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean how could I like you know cure my hams or any?

385
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,695
Speaker 0: You know I cure hams, but you know You know what I would do.

386
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,470
Speaker 1: I would start selling salt shakers in the street.

387
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:19,550
Speaker 0: You know what they charge for salt.

388
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:24,390
Speaker 0: It's like if you want to get the salt shaker from the panko TDN they charge you like we're getting like seven eight bucks.

389
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:35,329
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

390
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:38,682
Speaker 1: So you know the exit sign the red exit sign.

391
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:41,090
Speaker 1: it's everywhere in the world.

392
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,861
Speaker 1: Oh wait wait in the United States not not the whole.

393
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:45,187
Speaker 1: the whole world doesn't speak English.

394
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:45,789
Speaker 0: No kidding.

395
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:51,630
Speaker 1: So in the US we have this exit sign for many of our listeners might not be aware of this.

396
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,629
Speaker 1: It's a red sign that says exit, and it's all.

397
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:59,028
Speaker 0: no It's a white sign has the word exit in red letters, and it's usually lit up with a light bulb.

398
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:01,402
Speaker 1: so oftentimes It's a black sign with the word exit.

399
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:04,033
Speaker 0: I've never seen that Often okay.

400
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:07,226
Speaker 1: anyway it says exit, and it's lit up, and there's laws about.

401
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,130
Speaker 1: you have to have these things.

402
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:08,828
Speaker 1: They have to be lit up.

403
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,996
Speaker 1: They have to tell people where the exits are because back in the day without those signs Building catches fire.

404
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:14,780
Speaker 1: everyone just died.

405
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,625
Speaker 1: they didn't know how to get out.

406
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

407
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,336
Speaker 0: well I mean you know.

408
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:18,890
Speaker 0: let's say I'm in a building right.

409
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,185
Speaker 0: I mean if I'm familiar with the building and I need to get out right.

410
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:23,270
Speaker 0: It's like think about this.

411
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:26,316
Speaker 0: I've used the elevator all the time, but in a fire I can't use the elevator.

412
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,530
Speaker 0: so I stand up and I say I got to get the hell out of here.

413
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,878
Speaker 0: So I gotta look where's the nearest exit.

414
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,006
Speaker 0: so I've never used the stairwell.

415
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:34,250
Speaker 0: I mean I'm on the seventh floor.

416
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,970
Speaker 0: I don't use the stairwell in my office building.

417
00:21:36,072 --> 00:21:36,336
Speaker 0: I don't know.

418
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:37,168
Speaker 0: we even know where it is.

419
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:46,030
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna look for one of those red exit signs to figure out where the hell to get that hell out and if I That sign isn't there my exit will be much delayed.

420
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:52,658
Speaker 0: Well, that's also why if I imagine if I'm in an unfamiliar building like I'm go for a meeting in some building I'm a job interview.

421
00:21:52,678 --> 00:22:00,849
Speaker 1: I don't know where the hell the eggs It is how many people I run into just going to work or in Grand Central like in the lower floor like the main and Just can't figure out how to get outside.

422
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:07,247
Speaker 1: Yeah But I took a whole class on this at RIT on like haptic design and you just interface design and all that.

423
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:10,459
Speaker 1: and then this Great example of a serious problem.

424
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:15,618
Speaker 1: if you have a stairwell and people are evacuating in an emergency They tend to just go all the way to the basement.

425
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:16,341
Speaker 0: Yep.

426
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:18,210
Speaker 1: They don't even think to stop at the ground floor.

427
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:27,268
Speaker 1: so a lot of places mandate putting a physical divider just Forcing you to stop and before you go into the basement say do I really want to go down one more flight?

428
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:32,230
Speaker 0: in the building That I live in the stairwell to the basement is actually a separate stairwell from the other stairwell.

429
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,428
Speaker 1: Man, you might be fucked if you don't realize you're on the ground floor and you run into that one.

430
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:38,034
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

431
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:40,165
Speaker 1: you run into that want to go down to the basement.

432
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:40,989
Speaker 1: there's no other way out.

433
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:49,852
Speaker 0: It's kind of hard because in order to get into the place where you enter to the basement stairwell from the first floor is Right near.

434
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:55,210
Speaker 0: you can see outside from there and if you're in the basement, you can also get outside from the basement.

435
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:58,042
Speaker 0: So it's actually you know, it's not the worst idea.

436
00:22:58,484 --> 00:22:59,970
Speaker 1: my building, you know both my company.

437
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:02,770
Speaker 1: We have these disaster kits in case you know, there's ever a serious problem.

438
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:05,364
Speaker 1: Mmm, especially, you know, I didn't work there when this happened.

439
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,570
Speaker 1: remember the steam pipe explosion.

440
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:08,699
Speaker 1: Yep, that was outside the window of my office.

441
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:14,700
Speaker 1: All right, and from what old co-workers tell me Basically, one guy said the power flickered.

442
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:15,784
Speaker 1: What was that noise?

443
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:20,285
Speaker 1: Someone else says yeah There's smoke coming out of Grand Central and two seconds later.

444
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:21,129
Speaker 1: Everyone's gone.

445
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:25,602
Speaker 1: But we have like a repelling kit to get out of the building.

446
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,290
Speaker 0: now I would just use it for fun.

447
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:31,459
Speaker 1: We also have I have a written air supply.

448
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,185
Speaker 1: I have like a 20 minute supply of oxygen.

449
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,670
Speaker 0: that's very necessary under my desk.

450
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,315
Speaker 1: I can pull the button and wait.

451
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,720
Speaker 0: everyone has one under their desk.

452
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,867
Speaker 1: Well all the important employees do.

453
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:40,810
Speaker 1: I don't have one.

454
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:43,488
Speaker 1: You should tell your company you need a disaster kit.

455
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,597
Speaker 1: It is a flashlight.

456
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:46,681
Speaker 1: It has a rape whistle.

457
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:47,704
Speaker 1: It has all.

458
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:49,270
Speaker 0: what do you need a rape whistle for in case?

459
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,776
Speaker 1: I like the building collapses on me.

460
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,784
Speaker 1: I can be like help tweet tweet tweet.

461
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:57,060
Speaker 0: Well, it's not a bad idea But an air horn be better because then what if you couldn't?

462
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,786
Speaker 0: you know, you're having trouble whistling.

463
00:23:59,167 --> 00:23:59,729
Speaker 0: you could just be like.

464
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,658
Speaker 1: I also have this this light.

465
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:04,874
Speaker 1: I can clip to myself that it's the craziest LED light I've ever seen.

466
00:24:04,915 --> 00:24:05,036
Speaker 1: like.

467
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,468
Speaker 1: it is painful to look at.

468
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:11,724
Speaker 1: Mmm, I kind of want to use it just as a flashlight But I don't want to not have it if the building ever catches fire.

469
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:12,790
Speaker 0: That's all high quality stuff.

470
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:16,355
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get my own kit and just put it in my desk Yeah And then take it to every office.

471
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:20,134
Speaker 1: the coolest part is the way the gas mask works because they're like don't open it It'll ruin it.

472
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:22,390
Speaker 1: you rip it open and it activates.

473
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:31,050
Speaker 1: Yep, automatically and you stick it on your face and you've got like 20 or 30 minutes of oxygen But one where the gas mask probably expensive but a whistle and a light bulb became yeah.

474
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,315
Speaker 0: But the guys are telling kids probably also expensive.

475
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:41,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, only a few people have those and They're trained in its use to get everyone else down because they decided they don't want everyone to have one.

476
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:51,875
Speaker 1: in case Someone wants to quit the company an epic epic glory by repelling down the side of the building repelling down the store down the building fingers held high Tempted to do that.

477
00:24:52,016 --> 00:24:54,630
Speaker 0: I would repel out the building and put graffiti on the side.

478
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:01,805
Speaker 0: Actually my you know, but my office, you know does have openable windows and it's like eight stories down.

479
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:03,610
Speaker 0: or repelling kit actually be pretty useful.

480
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,419
Speaker 0: It's a big window.

481
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,410
Speaker 0: I could get out it pretty easy.

482
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,921
Speaker 1: So what does the rest of the world use for exit signs?

483
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:11,750
Speaker 1: because much of the world does not have our fancy word exit.

484
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:13,837
Speaker 1: I mean our word is pretty good.

485
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:15,321
Speaker 1: I don't know what words you have elsewhere.

486
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,047
Speaker 1: I mean Sally dot whatever.

487
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:17,910
Speaker 1: that's way too long.

488
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:21,882
Speaker 1: So it turns out there is in fact an international standard.

489
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:26,723
Speaker 1: the entire freaking world uses the standard Except us like the metric system.

490
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:27,064
Speaker 0: Yep.

491
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,090
Speaker 1: Screw you world.

492
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:32,629
Speaker 1: So the rest of the world has this picture of a green guy running out of door.

493
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:40,519
Speaker 1: Yep, it was designed by some Japanese Yukio OTA and Kind of recently like in the 80s.

494
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:49,252
Speaker 0: I think actually there's a new rule though Every like door to a stairwell in New York City has to have exit on it and they put the green man on a lot Of those.

495
00:25:49,272 --> 00:25:52,210
Speaker 1: yeah, the green man is starting to crop up in major cities, but nowhere else.

496
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:57,170
Speaker 1: Yeah There's apparently a big fight between the Soviets and the Japanese over two slightly different.

497
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:59,561
Speaker 1: Basically, the Soviets were like your designs.

498
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,489
Speaker 1: Okay, but doesn't actually show a door.

499
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:04,530
Speaker 1: So we're gonna make one with a door and the Japanese.

500
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,149
Speaker 0: well I think what it was that they both simultaneously and separately designed really similar things and then well and then everyone was like.

501
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:14,123
Speaker 0: well Two people came up with this so it's a similar design.

502
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:15,430
Speaker 0: Obviously, they're on the right track.

503
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:17,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they quibbled over details for a while.

504
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,236
Speaker 1: But my building has both.

505
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:22,576
Speaker 1: it is the exit signs and has a little green guy on the stairwells Mm-hmm.

506
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,389
Speaker 0: Yep The green guy in the stairwells is coming really common in the u.s.

507
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:26,394
Speaker 0: But in New York City.

508
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:35,790
Speaker 1: the story behind this is just really interesting and my thing of the day It's just this just long article talking all about it and the people involved and the arguments and all the examples of it.

509
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,273
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

510
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:36,816
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

511
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,090
Speaker 0: So my thing today is man packs Scott's man pack, right?

512
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:56,770
Speaker 0: So at you might know about Amazon subscription service, right and the way the Amazon subscription service works is let's say you know That you use right one roll of toilet paper every week Which means you use three or four rolls a month, which means you need 12 rolls every three months.

513
00:26:56,871 --> 00:27:06,516
Speaker 0: You go to Amazon and you say hey Amazon send me 12 rolls every three months and they'll just send you 12 rolls every three months forever and keep charging you for it and You'll get a substantial discount.

514
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:09,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you have to figure out your burn rate and be accurate.

515
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:14,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know and they even have like a little system to help you figure out your burn rate and such.

516
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,638
Speaker 1: So how much do you poop?

517
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:22,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you can you know, it's not just toilet paper You can use it for like, you know, pretty much anything they sell which is a large variety of non-perishable.

518
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,949
Speaker 0: You know, I just pick groceries type goods.

519
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:30,649
Speaker 1: I just I this vague image of some fairly wealthy trust fund kid who has an iPod subscription.

520
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:50,560
Speaker 0: But anyway, man packs calm is a similar thing You know you basically subscribe to man packs to socks underwear and under shirts and it's the cheapest plan is like $7 a month, but for just socks and they'll send you three pairs of socks Every three months.

521
00:27:50,863 --> 00:27:51,729
Speaker 1: the coolest part of it.

522
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:58,463
Speaker 1: I was reading like the rationale behind it and the idea was Guys don't ever replace underwear and socks until they're forced to.

523
00:27:58,664 --> 00:27:58,945
Speaker 0: and you were.

524
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:08,670
Speaker 0: I see I do it all at once Right, but if you do this You'll slide you'll always be slightly cycling in out with the old out oldest and in with the newest all the time.

525
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:15,810
Speaker 0: So you'll always have some new some medium and you'll never have some old old nasties because you'll get rid of them like like my loincloth.

526
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:17,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, right.

527
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:25,470
Speaker 0: But what I've been doing is I basically everything's new everything's medium that everything's old that everything's new But you hold out with the old forever, right?

528
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,349
Speaker 0: But there's a situation where you're like everything is old and that's not a good situation to be in.

529
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:29,994
Speaker 0: You know, like what?

530
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:31,143
Speaker 0: if I have to do something fancy?

531
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:36,519
Speaker 0: I don't have any new Just fancy underwear party.

532
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:46,070
Speaker 1: well, no, you know socks or whatever, you know Party, I have white crappy socks that I wear under boots and things and then I have nice black socks that I wear.

533
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,569
Speaker 0: The point is like the price of this is actually ridiculously cheap.

534
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,473
Speaker 0: Look $33.

535
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:52,215
Speaker 1: Here's my question.

536
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:54,401
Speaker 1: How nice are these underwear and socks?

537
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:57,470
Speaker 1: You can shoot they're all like Hanes like I can't wear white socks.

538
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:01,790
Speaker 0: Well, no, they have choices of different colors and everything but it's like it's all Hanes stuff.

539
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,172
Speaker 0: It's all.

540
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:03,317
Speaker 0: it's all the same stuff.

541
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,145
Speaker 0: I would buy in the store, right?

542
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:09,450
Speaker 0: No different and You know, you just choose exactly what you want.

543
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:16,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything is Hanes and they have every different Hane variety of sock, you know standard sock under shirt underwear.

544
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,865
Speaker 0: You give you a wife beaters or whatever, but but what about my silica boxers?

545
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,010
Speaker 1: Can I get silk ones?

546
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,085
Speaker 0: let's see because they have a Classic woven but no only woven.

547
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:28,710
Speaker 0: they don't have silk.

548
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,797
Speaker 1: Granted, I don't know if silk is.

549
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:32,970
Speaker 1: I used to wear silk boxers like in middle in high school.

550
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:34,757
Speaker 1: I like eight pairs of silk boxers.

551
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:37,890
Speaker 1: I rotated through them every day and I washed him by hand because they were delicate.

552
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:48,610
Speaker 1: They were the best things ever Unless you sweated because then silk turns from the most wonderful fabric in the world into very finely ground sandpaper.

553
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:49,815
Speaker 0: So you can get like.

554
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:53,430
Speaker 0: the biggest pack they offer is the macho pack thirty three dollars every three months.

555
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,347
Speaker 0: So eleven dollars a month gets you three underwear three shirts and three socks.

556
00:29:58,607 --> 00:29:59,290
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

557
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,001
Speaker 0: So just you know every.

558
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:09,633
Speaker 0: you know, three months you just get three more of everything and you get rid of the oldest three and you got to figure out the number you need total and You're set.

559
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,358
Speaker 1: that's really not bad at all.

560
00:30:11,438 --> 00:30:14,768
Speaker 0: It's not a bad price considering, you know, what those things usually cost.

561
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,655
Speaker 0: so Pretty awesome.

562
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:19,023
Speaker 1: I know that they're marketing this only to man.

563
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:28,730
Speaker 1: I wonder I want to ask the listeners Is it just guys who will never throw away underwear and then be forced to by circumstance by the fact that half my underwear ended?

564
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,429
Speaker 1: Up being literally nothing more than sideways loincloths?

565
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:37,728
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that ladies will buy and are more likely to buy new underwear when their underwear is no good.

566
00:30:37,828 --> 00:30:38,570
Speaker 1: Emily saying no.

567
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:43,999
Speaker 1: So that's hopefully.

568
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,889
Speaker 0: ladies need a greater quantity of underwear.

569
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:47,352
Speaker 1: When?

570
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:50,620
Speaker 1: now how could you say that they knew you?

571
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:54,110
Speaker 1: do you wear a pair of underwear more than one day?

572
00:30:54,933 --> 00:31:02,980
Speaker 0: ladies by default if they have boobs need twice as much underwear, well Guys need unless they have some sort of one-piece underwear.

573
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,504
Speaker 0: I've never seen that so I'll say this.

574
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:06,670
Speaker 1: I don't consider t-shirts underwear.

575
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,290
Speaker 1: There's something different because I don't wear teeth like look, right?

576
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,655
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I'm saying.

577
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:13,387
Speaker 0: is that a bra is underwear there and a t-shirt is not.

578
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:21,170
Speaker 1: therefore But why I need twice as much underwear, what about a bros ear a man's ear a bro?

579
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,394
Speaker 0: Do you wear a bro?

580
00:31:22,695 --> 00:31:23,859
Speaker 0: No, then why didn't?

581
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,726
Speaker 0: you're wearing half as much underwear?

582
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:27,010
Speaker 1: What about a really tight t-shirt?

583
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,789
Speaker 1: Isn't that just a sports bra?

584
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,235
Speaker 0: No Are you wearing it under?

585
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:35,744
Speaker 1: I mean luckily I get away with this and I look.

586
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:37,952
Speaker 1: I got like the blazer on right and I Got the dress shirt.

587
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:39,557
Speaker 1: Look no undershirt.

588
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:40,380
Speaker 0: Isn't it warm?

589
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,270
Speaker 0: still wearing the blazer while sitting usually take it off when you sit.

590
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:44,416
Speaker 1: I'm kind of used to it.

591
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:46,548
Speaker 1: Okay, but I wear these things every stupid day.

592
00:31:48,412 --> 00:31:49,629
Speaker 1: Actually, this one's due for a dry cleaning.

593
00:31:53,512 --> 00:32:01,278
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is done if you need underwear sign up and you're a man and you have a you can Woman who wears man's underwear.

594
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,085
Speaker 1: What about a man who wears women's underwear?

595
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:04,249
Speaker 0: This is not the site for you.

596
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:09,513
Speaker 1: So Avatar we went.

597
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:15,210
Speaker 1: we went and seen a movie that wasn't an anime wasn't an indie film wasn't in some weird theater.

598
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,630
Speaker 1: We went to see a normal mainstream movie.

599
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:19,750
Speaker 0: We only way late after it had been out forever.

600
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:21,036
Speaker 1: It was freaking sold out.

601
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:27,905
Speaker 1: every time I tried to say well cuz you kept trying to see in fancy 3d Cuz in the city, I didn't want to not see it in 3d.

602
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about it.

603
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,786
Speaker 1: There are a lot of cities where you you couldn't see it in 3d.

604
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:39,449
Speaker 1: That's true Yeah, but the thing I was most surprised about was that instead of being about Aang and his adventures it was these blue people.

605
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:49,026
Speaker 0: I Also was very much confused, you know, not you know When all these talk of Avatar movies like what was what was what?

606
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:49,949
Speaker 0: but now I have it.

607
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,413
Speaker 1: now I have it sorted because I had that at first, you know I didn't.

608
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,729
Speaker 1: I don't pay attention to movie news.

609
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,661
Speaker 1: So I like to avatar the show and then people were like.

610
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:57,444
Speaker 0: I knew that.

611
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:58,950
Speaker 0: I knew there was a show named avatar.

612
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:03,490
Speaker 1: People were like avatar movie and I was like bald kid avatar.

613
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:07,830
Speaker 1: All right, then they're like James Cameron and I was like James Cameron's making an avatar.

614
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,857
Speaker 0: I didn't even know who James Cameron was really.

615
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:10,359
Speaker 0: Yeah.

616
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,655
Speaker 0: Wow people are like, but you know people were like, oh my god This movie is so popular.

617
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:23,309
Speaker 0: I'm like the movie of the cartoon that that rim likes is So popular it's taken over the world but way later I'm like I knew all right.

618
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,193
Speaker 0: So does it make that?

619
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:30,235
Speaker 1: there are two movies called avatar and then recently I realized they changed the name of the bald kid movie To the last airbender.

620
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,158
Speaker 0: That's a good move.

621
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:31,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think.

622
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:33,164
Speaker 1: but now there's memorial.

623
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:35,010
Speaker 1: She also making a movie called avatar.

624
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:36,755
Speaker 0: That's an old movie.

625
00:33:36,996 --> 00:33:37,578
Speaker 0: That sucks.

626
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,144
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought it was a new movie.

627
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:39,586
Speaker 0: No.

628
00:33:40,028 --> 00:33:47,393
Speaker 0: Oh awesome You know the one that you know, the one that we saw the the the it was like sweet is Swedish or whatever Austrian.

629
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:48,538
Speaker 0: what country did he make it in?

630
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:50,870
Speaker 1: Oh, but wasn't that called?

631
00:33:52,453 --> 00:33:53,180
Speaker 0: What was it called?

632
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,074
Speaker 1: It was called something else And it sucked.

633
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:56,796
Speaker 0: it did.

634
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:57,901
Speaker 0: I'm sorry tomorrow.

635
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,230
Speaker 1: she I like your animes I don't like your real movies.

636
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:02,600
Speaker 0: Avalon I was close.

637
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,806
Speaker 0: a V began with.

638
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:04,670
Speaker 0: it was mama Roshi.

639
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,501
Speaker 0: You can't blame me for getting that one wrong.

640
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:14,313
Speaker 1: that movie was awesome And then it sucked and then it was awesome again for like five minutes and then it sucked and then it sucked if they just left Off that last twist.

641
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:14,856
Speaker 0: Okay.

642
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:16,542
Speaker 0: So mama Roshi's Avalon is bad.

643
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:16,983
Speaker 0: Is he so?

644
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:18,830
Speaker 0: is he really making a new movie avatar?

645
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,217
Speaker 1: I heard something weird about that.

646
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:27,346
Speaker 1: Anyway, so all that aside I Figured out that there was a difference between these two movies.

647
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,030
Speaker 1: a long time ago.

648
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:37,165
Speaker 1: I was on the train shortly before we moved to the city and this cool guy saw me watching bald kid avatar on the train On my laptop because I fucking love it and he's like, oh I have a tar.

649
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,257
Speaker 1: my kids were watching it But then it was actually awesome.

650
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:40,083
Speaker 1: So I watched it too.

651
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:40,366
Speaker 1: Isn't it?

652
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:48,313
Speaker 1: Awesome Funny how adults like us like it and we were talking about it and then as I'm leaving the train he's like, oh, yeah But did you see that?

653
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:52,050
Speaker 1: You know, they're making a movie about it, but it's all like weird and everybody's blue.

654
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,592
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck's going on with that and that I never saw the guy again So you couldn't.

655
00:34:56,914 --> 00:35:01,048
Speaker 0: I'm sure he's figured out by now as we have either that he had the same confusion he had.

656
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:03,012
Speaker 1: Yeah He's not.

657
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,116
Speaker 0: he's not a stupid person.

658
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:05,079
Speaker 0: We're talking about.

659
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,781
Speaker 0: we're stupid.

660
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,466
Speaker 1: We're talking about blue people.

661
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:13,089
Speaker 0: 3d James Cameron Yep, so I pretty much knew what to expect based on internet rumblings.

662
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:22,270
Speaker 0: You know some sort of you know tree huggin type movie with a fern gully kind of plot But also but also robots in action and 3d and crazy special effects.

663
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:26,050
Speaker 0: Here's what I saw in dollars of Hollywood production one James Cameron.

664
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,738
Speaker 1: So I had a certain expectation already.

665
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:37,870
Speaker 1: that didn't give me an expectation because they mean anything to me But - I saw the internet hate machine Mobilized immediately on this movie and I don't know I mean a lot of our listeners are younger.

666
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,423
Speaker 1: But we were kind of like in the movie going like on our own.

667
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:46,964
Speaker 1: like I will go to the theater on my own As a kid when Titanic came out and never.

668
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:48,008
Speaker 0: I still never seen that movie.

669
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:55,190
Speaker 1: really Yeah, you know the Titanic and Avatar in the internet hate machine or back then it was pre before the internet hate machine existed.

670
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,049
Speaker 1: It was just the pop culture hate machine.

671
00:35:57,693 --> 00:36:00,487
Speaker 1: The movies were crazy popular right away and just had like they were.

672
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:06,530
Speaker 1: just they kept Generating crazy revenues every weekend like every theater just had the movie going and going and going.

673
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:08,194
Speaker 0: That was Jurassic Park.

674
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:17,607
Speaker 1: Yeah dress is in the theater for years, but Titanic and Avatar almost immediately Had this weird like reactionary situation where it was cool to be like.

675
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,438
Speaker 1: yeah Titanic fuck that movie.

676
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,090
Speaker 1: that movie sucked ass and you know what?

677
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,030
Speaker 1: It wasn't the greatest movie in the world, but it wasn't really a bad movie.

678
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:30,690
Speaker 1: It was a solid movie But because it was so popular like the more popular it got the more popular it was.

679
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:35,090
Speaker 1: To talk about how it was stupid that it was popular and how everyone who likes it sucks in the movie stupid.

680
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:37,399
Speaker 0: I haven't seen that much hate for Avatar.

681
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:40,210
Speaker 0: I've just seen normal rumblings, but it's been a larger rumbling.

682
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:40,829
Speaker 0: But it's you know.

683
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:43,362
Speaker 0: But the thing is that phenomenon you just described.

684
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:45,010
Speaker 0: I've seen it myself on.

685
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:52,678
Speaker 0: We were at work and we saw some ads on the internet for Celine Dion stuff something something and I was like What the hell like.

686
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:53,664
Speaker 0: I don't really know who it is.

687
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:54,690
Speaker 0: I know it's some seeing lady.

688
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,453
Speaker 0: Everyone makes fun of.

689
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:59,370
Speaker 0: that's pretty much all I know right, so I'm like doesn't everyone make fun of this lady?

690
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,535
Speaker 0: How is she making money?

691
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,082
Speaker 0: Why is there advertisements?

692
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:02,303
Speaker 0: who?

693
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:03,950
Speaker 0: and the advertisement was serious?

694
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,094
Speaker 0: It was like come see her.

695
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:11,637
Speaker 0: and I was like if it seems like the whole world hates this lady nope She's one of those popular entertainers ever right?

696
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:16,412
Speaker 0: so if she's so popular right then what do all these crazy fans if she has so Many fans?

697
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:24,527
Speaker 0: what are those fans think when they see this huge hate machine against this person who I don't even I don't even know Any you know song she sings, so I don't even know like her or not.

698
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:29,650
Speaker 0: yeah But the point is is I was I knew that it was someone that was made fun of and it's like.

699
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,012
Speaker 0: There's like.

700
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:40,156
Speaker 0: there are these huge hate machines for popular things that sort of defy the popularity of those things And the people who it's like it's.

701
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:45,550
Speaker 0: I think what the the symptom is is that you have something that is genuinely popular.

702
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:52,056
Speaker 0: But it's popular among people who are not vocal and loud in Proclaiming their fandom.

703
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:52,237
Speaker 0: well.

704
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:54,950
Speaker 1: I think it's people who aren't necessarily cinema fans.

705
00:37:55,312 --> 00:37:57,686
Speaker 1: They are just fans of that movie like oh that movie was cool.

706
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:58,049
Speaker 1: I liked it.

707
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:02,045
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not gonna be like writing a review on the internet like Harry Potter fans.

708
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:03,170
Speaker 0: Harry Potter fans are loud.

709
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,765
Speaker 0: They write fanfiction they dress up like Harry Potter.

710
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:06,590
Speaker 0: They wait in line.

711
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,813
Speaker 0: They're loud fans.

712
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:10,321
Speaker 0: right fans of Celine Dion are not loud.

713
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,584
Speaker 0: You know maybe at the concerts.

714
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:12,848
Speaker 0: They're loud, but in public.

715
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:13,490
Speaker 0: They're not loud.

716
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,542
Speaker 0: They're not proclaiming, and you know I don't know.

717
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:17,010
Speaker 0: are there Celine Dion fanfictions?

718
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,150
Speaker 1: Well the same thing with anime.

719
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,337
Speaker 1: I mean anime fandom.

720
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:21,248
Speaker 1: like anime fans are real loud about like.

721
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:26,390
Speaker 0: yeah Maybe just because of where we are we hear different loudnesses, but because we are we are not paying it.

722
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:30,469
Speaker 0: If there was a Celine Dion loudness we would not be in a position to hear it.

723
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:36,089
Speaker 1: But it like the seriously look at I mean the situation with trying to have a really good example of this now.

724
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:37,713
Speaker 1: Well regardless.

725
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:46,258
Speaker 1: so the complaints I saw primarily about avatar were that one people would say things like oh It's just a fern golly ripoff which was kind of true.

726
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,910
Speaker 1: It was true, but only on like the most superficial surface level.

727
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:55,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was also about you know tree hugging That's pretty much the only thing that has a common.

728
00:38:55,159 --> 00:39:06,590
Speaker 0: or a lot of people would say it was the noble savage blah Just like and immediately dismiss the movie on that alone, but when you look at me But I mean you know that's a silly argument to make because you know there are only eight stories.

729
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,150
Speaker 0: How many stories is it you know?

730
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,158
Speaker 1: What's that like the hero comes or right?

731
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:12,710
Speaker 1: yeah stranger comes to town someone goes out of right?

732
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,178
Speaker 0: So there's only X number of different stories to tell.

733
00:39:15,198 --> 00:39:15,299
Speaker 0: see.

734
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:17,949
Speaker 0: so any movie that comes out is gonna be one of those.

735
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,841
Speaker 0: that's like Saying oh, that's that one therefore.

736
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:20,223
Speaker 0: It sucks.

737
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:21,109
Speaker 0: Well then everything sucks.

738
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:29,950
Speaker 1: Their complaint wasn't really that valid in the movie because the movie was kind of yeah They're noble savages that are actually right about something.

739
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:33,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda at least within the context of the movie.

740
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:41,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah Not the broader picture, but it's not like Dances with Wolves where well actually it was a lot like Dances with Wolves except the ghost Dance kind of work.

741
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:42,238
Speaker 1: Well.

742
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:43,986
Speaker 0: I never saw Dances with Wolves anything really.

743
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:45,374
Speaker 0: I know it exists though And I know what it is.

744
00:39:45,394 --> 00:39:46,320
Speaker 1: movies are very similar.

745
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:47,146
Speaker 1: It's a good movie.

746
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:52,514
Speaker 0: anyway I only have I don't know how many complaints I have but very few.

747
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:59,543
Speaker 0: complaint number one that I had with the movie is that the Part where he was sort of like learning to become a foresty person.

748
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,048
Speaker 0: you know the montage.

749
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,530
Speaker 0: ish It was like it was gonna be a montage.

750
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,625
Speaker 0: I don't really want to call it a montage because a montage has like more.

751
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:07,329
Speaker 0: cutting is like.

752
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:10,762
Speaker 0: you know Rocky is a montage the quick cutting between different training things.

753
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,870
Speaker 0: right this was slower like you know.

754
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,690
Speaker 0: They showed a scene learning to get on the horse and they actually showed a scene learning to get on the dragon.

755
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,630
Speaker 0: But then they went further learning to fall out of the tree and these are actually meaningful scenes.

756
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,630
Speaker 0: It wasn't a quick cutting montage.

757
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:29,890
Speaker 0: It was like a slow building montage And I think my complaint with it is that as a result it felt like that part.

758
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:33,429
Speaker 0: I didn't actually time how long that was but it felt long to me.

759
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:44,110
Speaker 0: So it felt like the large portion of the movie like I literally felt like I spent 15 minutes Sitting there watching nothing happen, and I would have been happier with an actual quick cutting montage.

760
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,277
Speaker 1: No now here's where I would make the opposite argument.

761
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:50,070
Speaker 0: at the same time every single one of those scenes did come into play later.

762
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:53,941
Speaker 0: You know they called back to them at some point later in the movie.

763
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,208
Speaker 1: well see I'm gonna make the oshi argument.

764
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:57,535
Speaker 1: think about Skycrawlers.

765
00:40:57,817 --> 00:41:12,326
Speaker 1: the movie was in many ways Interminable, but it was a brilliant movie And it did a meta thing of like making certain scenes last a very long time and making certain aesthetics Just kind of repeat and repeat to put you into a mindset to then kind of experience.

766
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,250
Speaker 1: What's going on in the movie?

767
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did this movie do I mean?

768
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,070
Speaker 1: there's.

769
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:31,670
Speaker 1: the whole story is that the crippled marine has these two completely separate lives now with two completely separate bodies and During that whole sequence it keeps immersing you like long Physical time in that world toward that world and that reality of him is more real.

770
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:35,109
Speaker 1: And it's really jarring every time he wakes up in the real world.

771
00:41:35,551 --> 00:41:36,294
Speaker 0: Oh the movie death.

772
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:38,040
Speaker 0: that was like one of the best things the movie did.

773
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,510
Speaker 0: period but you know it just felt to me.

774
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,252
Speaker 0: You know the.

775
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:47,330
Speaker 0: the side effect of that which was negative was that a large portion of the movie it felt like nothing happened.

776
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,159
Speaker 1: See to me it didn't it base to me.

777
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,093
Speaker 0: it felt like and I was like all right come on Let's get a move on.

778
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:56,309
Speaker 1: it felt like I became immersed in kind of just the subtle reality did.

779
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:59,663
Speaker 0: yes That is true, but as a side effect nothing happened for a long time.

780
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,310
Speaker 0: so while I was being a murder forget.

781
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:06,190
Speaker 0: But I would have liked to have been immersed while something was happening, but stuff was happening.

782
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:09,608
Speaker 1: He was becoming one of them basically which is basically nothing happening.

783
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:14,505
Speaker 1: the plot He was not progressing in any way, but that's the point by not progressing the plot.

784
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,110
Speaker 1: It makes you forget about the plot.

785
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,990
Speaker 0: It's the same, but I didn't forget about the plot.

786
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:23,270
Speaker 0: I was thinking about the plot, and I was simultaneously being immersed in a world good and being bored bad.

787
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:28,252
Speaker 1: See I think what it was supposed to do And I think I think it did it very well Was that it?

788
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:28,834
Speaker 1: the?

789
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:34,153
Speaker 1: the plot is in the back of your mind and every time you think about the real world you were like Every time he wakes up.

790
00:42:34,173 --> 00:42:37,767
Speaker 1: There's the little like jolts between these long immersive scenes you're reminded.

791
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:40,399
Speaker 1: Oh shit Yeah, this is gonna get real bad real quick.

792
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,725
Speaker 0: I'm not disagreeing with you.

793
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:42,710
Speaker 0: that part was awesome.

794
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,317
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that did not distract me or pull me out of the movie at all And I didn't pull me out of the movie.

795
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:53,164
Speaker 0: the side effect of the fact that they did that Was that there was a stretch of nothing happened except.

796
00:42:53,244 --> 00:42:54,270
Speaker 1: I think we're happening.

797
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:56,818
Speaker 0: No Nothing is that and it wasn't boring at all to me.

798
00:42:56,838 --> 00:42:59,510
Speaker 0: felt to me that there were like 15 or 20 minutes where nothing happened.

799
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,056
Speaker 0: And second night my second complaint.

800
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:05,334
Speaker 1: I just I disagree with that whatever my second, but I do disagree with that I'm telling you.

801
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:08,090
Speaker 0: That's what I felt so you can't tell me that I was not.

802
00:43:08,353 --> 00:43:10,010
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that I did not feel that at all.

803
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:14,030
Speaker 0: I was bored for a long stretch in the in the in the sort of after the beginning.

804
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:22,801
Speaker 1: I was bored for a long stretch until the middle at least as you point out the fact that Every single moment of that whole bit in the middle mattered.

805
00:43:23,303 --> 00:43:24,246
Speaker 0: it did, but it was.

806
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:25,510
Speaker 0: you know that it was too.

807
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:26,510
Speaker 0: It felt too long.

808
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,138
Speaker 0: I don't know how long it actually was about.

809
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,350
Speaker 0: if I rewatch it and time it that will probably be like five minutes.

810
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think had you made felt had he made it shorter.

811
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,570
Speaker 1: It would have lost the the oceania, but he could have done.

812
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:37,090
Speaker 0: I'm saying he doesn't had to keep it shorter.

813
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:45,830
Speaker 0: He could have just done something else besides training in there You know had a side story or something and that would have you know preventing me from being bored and had the same effect.

814
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:46,889
Speaker 1: Well, they're kind of like three.

815
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:54,190
Speaker 0: That brings me to my next point which I think the other criticism had the movie is that the plot was incredibly simple.

816
00:43:54,752 --> 00:44:00,410
Speaker 0: It was not that is flex or intellectually challenging and or or unpredictable in any way whatsoever.

817
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:01,176
Speaker 1: It was a little.

818
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:01,881
Speaker 1: we're not gonna spoil.

819
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:04,216
Speaker 0: It was a tiny bit Ridiculous.

820
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:07,139
Speaker 1: all right guys Within the next few minutes.

821
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:08,850
Speaker 1: We're probably gonna accidentally spoil stuff.

822
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,690
Speaker 1: So if you haven't seen the movie and you care just stop listening right about now.

823
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,418
Speaker 0: It's really it's hard to spoil.

824
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:15,001
Speaker 0: is the point?

825
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:16,005
Speaker 1: yeah, but we're gonna spoil.

826
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:16,990
Speaker 0: is it's so simple?

827
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:17,873
Speaker 0: You know what?

828
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:22,570
Speaker 1: but the only thing about that that really bothered me was that the marine like the bad marine guy.

829
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:27,648
Speaker 1: His character was okay because I could see someone being that way like it worked, but he was respected.

830
00:44:28,593 --> 00:44:30,987
Speaker 1: But the stupid suit guy was just a shit.

831
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:32,594
Speaker 0: care dad They have those care.

832
00:44:32,614 --> 00:44:36,988
Speaker 0: that character is so common and so many freaking you know movies.

833
00:44:37,028 --> 00:44:37,450
Speaker 1: No look at him.

834
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,540
Speaker 1: He was a lot like the guy in district 9 except.

835
00:44:40,901 --> 00:44:41,985
Speaker 1: They didn't do it.

836
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:42,386
Speaker 1: Well.

837
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:42,847
Speaker 1: It was just.

838
00:44:42,908 --> 00:44:43,590
Speaker 1: he was just shitty.

839
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:52,419
Speaker 0: There's always that guy who's the boss who's just like incompetent and jerky you know and only and it's like get you know I've seen that character too many times.

840
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,567
Speaker 0: get him the hell out of my face.

841
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:55,876
Speaker 0: now Look at like.

842
00:44:55,936 --> 00:44:57,481
Speaker 0: Die Hard is a great example right?

843
00:44:57,501 --> 00:44:58,183
Speaker 0: look at Die Hard.

844
00:44:58,243 --> 00:45:06,110
Speaker 0: the boss of the the office in Die Hard You know is basically just like that you know, but the terrorist and Die Hard is like you know.

845
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:11,612
Speaker 0: He's smart you can you can you know give him your respects, but here's the kind of bad guy I mean.

846
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:20,152
Speaker 1: here's what they could have done that would have fixed that character for me 100% because he was you know that kind of Corporate jackass right yeah, imagine if at the you know he was like yeah, just do it just do it Just do it.

847
00:45:20,654 --> 00:45:27,469
Speaker 1: when things fell apart and the military guys were like let's just murder all those people We'll deal with it blah blah blah, and he was like yeah sure go for it.

848
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,769
Speaker 1: If he had at that point been like whoa this is way too far.

849
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:36,830
Speaker 1: And then like there'd been a little plot about that that could have made the character more interesting if he'd been a corporate shill.

850
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:39,836
Speaker 1: But then when it really Seriously is bad.

851
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:44,242
Speaker 0: Well there was the one part right where they went up to him And they were like look you were going to kill babies.

852
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,390
Speaker 0: Do you want this blood on your hands?

853
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,438
Speaker 0: He was like all right fine.

854
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,285
Speaker 0: You got one shot.

855
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:47,709
Speaker 0: Let's go.

856
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:55,670
Speaker 0: So they yeah, they showed that this guy was not just you know the stereotypical retarded boss guy character.

857
00:45:55,871 --> 00:45:56,534
Speaker 0: But they didn't use.

858
00:45:56,574 --> 00:45:57,880
Speaker 0: but then they didn't use it.

859
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:02,872
Speaker 0: and then you know at the end of the movie He's like just frowning like oh, that's like well What do you?

860
00:46:03,173 --> 00:46:03,734
Speaker 1: they really?

861
00:46:04,155 --> 00:46:09,010
Speaker 1: they could have made a subtle change that part of the story and had him just at some moment be?

862
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:16,370
Speaker 1: Like this has gone too far and suddenly his character is a good character But instead it was just kind of a crap character that was actually distracting from the movie.

863
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, and two I would have rather there not have been a way to transfer him for real.

864
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:23,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was that not been there?

865
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:28,856
Speaker 0: Well, it was so obvious when they tried it the first time yes that I was like oh well now I know the end of the movie.

866
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:29,279
Speaker 0: Thanks,

867
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:45,862
Speaker 1: but here two things Making it there like had it been there in the first part and failed if the end of the movie would have been He does some sort of sacrifice that will prevent him from doing that joining and like he knows that he cannot Do that and he gives that up to save them.

868
00:46:46,284 --> 00:46:55,333
Speaker 1: that could have been more powerful Or if they hadn't had that at all and he sacrificed himself and all those people sacrifice themselves knowing that they could not ever Like.

869
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:57,610
Speaker 1: they basically were all going to die and they did it anyway.

870
00:46:58,172 --> 00:46:59,458
Speaker 1: That also would have been a better ending.

871
00:46:59,478 --> 00:47:04,719
Speaker 1: the fact that he had the option and that he was able to pull it off I thought was a little bit of a cop-out.

872
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

873
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:20,670
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the thing is you notice how the movie You know the people Who they either killed or made it appear that people were killed when they no longer needed the character in the story And then at the end they just any character that had died off-screen or you weren't sure was dead.

874
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:34,060
Speaker 0: They you know could bring back so they were able to choose who is dead and who is alive But they were able to just remove people they no longer wanted to show in the movie towards the end When they wanted to concentrate on the main characters They just took everyone else out of the picture who they didn't want around anymore.

875
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:43,790
Speaker 1: However, also all that aside the movie as it was While it was predictable to a degree I pretty much had even odds on him baking it or not.

876
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:47,750
Speaker 0: Well, I mean toward the you know, the exact specifics of what went down at the end.

877
00:47:48,051 --> 00:47:48,313
Speaker 0: It's like.

878
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:50,889
Speaker 0: I actually came up with some like better ways to do it.

879
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:59,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is my better ways are better in terms of like oh Well, it would have been a moral quandary or you know, it would have been a you know, something something.

880
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:03,790
Speaker 0: But it probably would not have been better in terms of making mad money.

881
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:04,933
Speaker 0: Right.

882
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:11,102
Speaker 0: the way the movie is is probably the way it is and Resulted in its incredible box-office success.

883
00:48:11,163 --> 00:48:19,170
Speaker 0: and if you know any of these slight Improvements like making the plot more intelligent or more complex or more morally challenging probably would have heard it in the box office.

884
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,370
Speaker 0: Well at the same at the same time is why I'm not in charge of those things.

885
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:39,617
Speaker 1: There's a problem that I've fallen forward before and I think a lot of people who are into cinema or into these sorts of things Or look at movies with more intellectual event You sort of get into this trap to where you always want the sad ending because the bad ending is more true or more likely Or more realistic or more interesting.

886
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:41,685
Speaker 0: I don't necessarily need a sad ending.

887
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:45,178
Speaker 0: I just need a more Unexpected and interesting ending.

888
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:48,893
Speaker 0: if I can, you know, I mean you need to have foreshadowing, you know Chekhov's gun.

889
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:49,817
Speaker 0: isn't this necessary?

890
00:48:49,837 --> 00:48:55,130
Speaker 0: because if you don't have any foreshadowing there are like 10 Chekhov's guns Thousand Chekhov's penises, right?

891
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,573
Speaker 1: If you don't have however I did not.

892
00:48:57,613 --> 00:48:59,139
Speaker 1: there was a non Chekhov gun.

893
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,532
Speaker 1: when that when they he runs off near in the middle like Toward the end to like do his thing in The like.

894
00:49:04,552 --> 00:49:08,950
Speaker 1: they all escaped from prison and the marine guys like you assholes and just runs outside with a gun.

895
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:16,103
Speaker 0: One of the most obvious Chekhov's guns was the falling down a great distance But using the giant tree leaves to slow the descent and survive.

896
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:17,027
Speaker 0: but that was well done.

897
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:18,533
Speaker 0: right now The thing is right.

898
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:23,370
Speaker 0: that is necessary because they just showed him doing that without you know, showing you him practicing that.

899
00:49:23,732 --> 00:49:25,584
Speaker 0: It's like oh give me a fucking break, right?

900
00:49:25,624 --> 00:49:26,530
Speaker 0: What the fuck is this shit?

901
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,043
Speaker 1: Especially because they showed him sucking at it the first time.

902
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:30,190
Speaker 0: he had to do right exactly.

903
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,036
Speaker 0: So by you know by doing the Chekhov.

904
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,926
Speaker 0: it becomes believable when he does it for real, right?

905
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:45,962
Speaker 0: It's like aha I see what you did there But at the same time if you have too much Chekhov in the plot department Then it's like I know exactly what's gonna happen.

906
00:49:46,022 --> 00:49:47,367
Speaker 0: Why don't you just leave now?

907
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:48,310
Speaker 0: I could tell you the ending.

908
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,116
Speaker 0: What's the point to agree to do you?

909
00:49:50,417 --> 00:50:03,713
Speaker 0: what you need to do right is the correct technique is to bring out Chekhov's gun And then right after you bring it out Another Chekhov's gun mixes with the first one in a way you didn't see coming because you can see Individual guns.

910
00:50:03,974 --> 00:50:07,724
Speaker 0: you can't see two guns pointed at each other from a great distance.

911
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:10,231
Speaker 0: So that is the trick, you know It's.

912
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:10,894
Speaker 1: you know what that is.

913
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:11,978
Speaker 1: You don't you know what that is.

914
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,850
Speaker 1: That is the openers to Gundam seed.

915
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:17,622
Speaker 0: No, no, no, it's snatch right in snatch.

916
00:50:17,662 --> 00:50:19,510
Speaker 0: It's like I see this is going this way.

917
00:50:19,632 --> 00:50:30,950
Speaker 0: I see this is going that way But then two people open a door and they're standing in the hallway facing each other and it's like oh fuck, you know You silly fat bastard pull your socks up, right?

918
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:31,970
Speaker 0: So that's right.

919
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:35,638
Speaker 0: So that is the right way To do things in the book of Scott.

920
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:49,457
Speaker 1: the other way to do it and I've seen this done to great effect is to have the Chekhov's gun be so prominent and so Scooby-doo and Then just have nothing happen with it until everyone forgets it's there exact The comedian.

921
00:50:49,477 --> 00:50:50,660
Speaker 0: you gotta have a comedian.

922
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:58,785
Speaker 0: figure that out for you because the comedian will tell the jokes early in the routine and at The very end the last line will be a callback to that earlier joke that you forgot about.

923
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:00,270
Speaker 1: Bill Cosby was the fucking master.

924
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, so many people are the master that you know, but you need to have a comedian.

925
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:05,490
Speaker 0: get that timing for you on that one.

926
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:08,950
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it doesn't work like Emily and I a while ago went to see who's afraid of Virginia wolf.

927
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:16,253
Speaker 1: It's a great play and there's I'm not gonna spoil it, but there's that Gigantic gun like over the fireplace and you just know someone's gay It's the.

928
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:19,390
Speaker 0: it's the guy dressed all in white who stands there not doing anything.

929
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,965
Speaker 0: You know, he's gonna do the crazy kung-fu, you know, but I'm looking at the gun.

930
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:24,973
Speaker 1: I'm like, that's the Chekhov's gun That's the Chekhov's gun.

931
00:51:24,993 --> 00:51:25,756
Speaker 1: That's the Chekhov's gun.

932
00:51:25,776 --> 00:51:31,288
Speaker 1: That's the chicken, but I totally didn't say it coming when the Chekhov's gun Chekhov Then he did it, right?

933
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,086
Speaker 0: That's the way it goes.

934
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:42,105
Speaker 0: But I only other thing I had to say about the movie is the three d-ness Right is I'm torn on the use of the three d-ness in this movie in

935
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:51,014
Speaker 1: half the scenes like it was Brilliant and in half the scenes it kind of stood out is like this is more 3d than it needs to be like it's kind Of silly 3d right.

936
00:51:51,115 --> 00:51:53,442
Speaker 0: and then in other scenes it was like this scene.

937
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,876
Speaker 0: really the 3d isn't doing anything for this scene So why even have it?

938
00:51:57,036 --> 00:52:02,570
Speaker 1: but at the same time if you're making a movie 3d just in general You don't want to just turn off the 3d whenever you're not gonna do something clever.

939
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:07,753
Speaker 0: Well, actually I peeked under my glasses at some points and you could see that some parts of the screen Were 3d in.

940
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:08,877
Speaker 0: some parts weren't you know?

941
00:52:09,078 --> 00:52:09,258
Speaker 0: Yeah.

942
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:14,238
Speaker 0: Another thing is that the 3d technology is it's it's pretty good But it's not a hundred percent of the way there.

943
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:20,660
Speaker 0: Sometimes it still looks like, you know Multiple 2d things just at different set depths.

944
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:25,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it looks like two pieces of paper moving in front of each other so like South Park a little bit.

945
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:35,096
Speaker 0: and The other thing is that You know the 3d only really stands out right like when you go to Disney World and you go watch honey I shrunk the audience, right?

946
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:41,194
Speaker 0: It's like they fucking three because it's always like the needle in your eye like Now.

947
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:51,814
Speaker 0: doing it so much like that is obviously Distracting and unsettling and annoying and you want to be very light with it and subtle right to make it good for an extended Two hour frickin movie.

948
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,737
Speaker 0: You can't be doing honey.

949
00:52:52,777 --> 00:52:53,620
Speaker 0: I shrunk the audience.

950
00:52:54,162 --> 00:53:05,296
Speaker 0: or Muppet 3d or Michael Jackson 3d But at the same time if you're not really getting up in the face at all or enough, it's not really 3d ing You got to do it.

951
00:53:05,537 --> 00:53:09,770
Speaker 0: I think a little bit more of it would have been appropriate but not too much more.

952
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,200
Speaker 1: Imagine a future where more movies are 3d.

953
00:53:12,642 --> 00:53:20,830
Speaker 1: a lot of movies will have just like subtle Atmospheric 3d effects that are just enhancing without making them like integral to what you're watching.

954
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:30,360
Speaker 0: I think the one thing that's missing from 3d movies right now, right that I think could actually make you know Me say this movie's got to be fucking 3d.

955
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,945
Speaker 0: 3d is just better than 2d.

956
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:32,809
Speaker 0: There's no reason to use 2d.

957
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:36,300
Speaker 0: Is we need something from the back right?

958
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,025
Speaker 0: you think about watching Star Wars.

959
00:53:38,045 --> 00:53:39,490
Speaker 0: What is the first thing you see in Star Wars?

960
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,769
Speaker 0: It's a super stardestroyer coming from over the top.

961
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:48,595
Speaker 0: well, just regular stardestroyer coming from over the top behind you down to the front right and They get the surround sound.

962
00:53:48,615 --> 00:53:49,438
Speaker 0: they figured that out.

963
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:52,930
Speaker 0: you hear it coming from behind and you see it coming down from the top.

964
00:53:53,754 --> 00:53:56,205
Speaker 1: Some of the directors control to force you like.

965
00:53:56,245 --> 00:53:57,290
Speaker 1: this is the only screen you can see.

966
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:10,470
Speaker 0: I'm saying if I go to see Star Wars in 3d if a soup if the stardestroyer comes from the back of my head and comes down Over the front and I see it coming from behind if I look up and see the bottom of it on top of me.

967
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:11,746
Speaker 0: That is fucking 3d.

968
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:20,602
Speaker 0: That's possible right like you look and it is in the fucking movie theater right above Everybody going forward and not just coming down from the top of the screen.

969
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:23,230
Speaker 0: That is what we need for 3d movies possible.

970
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:31,103
Speaker 1: But that was one thing that drew me out of the movie a couple of times when something big like came out of the screen Ship or something, but then I'd see it suddenly disappear at the edges of the screen.

971
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:33,030
Speaker 1: That was is still in my field of view.

972
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:33,898
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

973
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:34,970
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

974
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:40,650
Speaker 0: That's why I think you know a true IMAX 3d would be able to do something like that.

975
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,878
Speaker 0: You know because the IMAX the screen goes up above.

976
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:50,735
Speaker 0: so if you had a true Star Wars 3d IMAX You could actually make the stardestroyer come from above To the front.

977
00:54:50,976 --> 00:54:54,088
Speaker 0: you it would sound like it was coming from above to the front and it would be in 3d.

978
00:54:55,332 --> 00:54:57,207
Speaker 0: You know that is what we need to go for.

979
00:54:57,247 --> 00:55:01,408
Speaker 0: one thing I do want to talk about because no one's gonna You know one's gonna watch that and say oh it could have been in 2d.

980
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:04,988
Speaker 0: But someone who saw Avatar and said oh it would have been the same in 2d.

981
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,482
Speaker 0: It's like well kinda almost you can you know you can't.

982
00:55:08,502 --> 00:55:11,353
Speaker 0: just you know totally dismiss that argument You know.

983
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:14,807
Speaker 0: but with the IMAX from behind you could dismiss them easily.

984
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:16,597
Speaker 1: well a point I do want to make about the movie.

985
00:55:16,678 --> 00:55:19,195
Speaker 1: cuz I'll you know I don't if we didn't say it I like the movie.

986
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,281
Speaker 1: I think it was a solid movie.

987
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:21,166
Speaker 1: I'm glad I watched it.

988
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:21,890
Speaker 0: It was okay.

989
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:26,656
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna run on by the DVD or watch it again, or you know I think it was a great like pop.

990
00:55:26,816 --> 00:55:32,398
Speaker 1: it think of this a very popular sci-fi like good Blockbuster movie it's.

991
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:41,370
Speaker 1: it's proved so much in the meta level like Piracy aside blockbusters still sell and things like that and it reminded I think some people in the industry.

992
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:45,703
Speaker 1: I hope that sci-fi can be very popular if presented properly duh.

993
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:52,750
Speaker 0: I think part of the problem though is that they Daryl Surratt he said something that I think I I think is true at least for me.

994
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:57,488
Speaker 0: It's like you want us to go see a movie of blue people versus robots and cheer for the blue people.

995
00:55:59,753 --> 00:56:00,176
Speaker 0: Where is the?

996
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,150
Speaker 0: where is the movie where the robots are the good guy?

997
00:56:05,772 --> 00:56:10,430
Speaker 1: Well well, but I what I do want to point out is that also the robots didn't really do enough.

998
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:12,337
Speaker 1: I think they weren't a big part.

999
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:12,899
Speaker 0: I know that's.

1000
00:56:12,999 --> 00:56:13,983
Speaker 0: I wanted to see more robot.

1001
00:56:14,064 --> 00:56:22,955
Speaker 1: I like robot, but what was Interesting is that what got me and you'd and a lot of people in our age group and a lot of people in general into Anime back in the day.

1002
00:56:23,538 --> 00:56:32,030
Speaker 1: it wasn't necessarily that it was animated that a lot of it was cool So it was just quality sci-fi leji Matsumoto, but what is a characteristic of a lot of that old-school?

1003
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,510
Speaker 1: Anime sci-fi the mechanical and technical design.

1004
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,075
Speaker 1: What did this movie do?

1005
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:41,570
Speaker 1: they put the cut the level of detail into the stuff that only nerds would care about?

1006
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:52,870
Speaker 1: Into a popular movie like you know the old leji Matsumoto with like the little designs on the train or the the mech show We're like all the sprockets in the mech actually matter and are self-consistent in the animation and that is true.

1007
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:57,450
Speaker 0: I mean I said it has a simple plot, but really starblazers has an equally simple plot.

1008
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:04,048
Speaker 1: yeah, you know and look at I mean the the mechs and the vehicles and the science and the the the flora and fauna.

1009
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:07,865
Speaker 1: and There was very specific technical design like all the 3d displays.

1010
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:08,770
Speaker 1: They had in the movie.

1011
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:14,261
Speaker 1: There was a lot of Non-distracting but very self-consistent use of technology in the movie.

1012
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:28,069
Speaker 1: hmm like every little display like there was kind of this consistent Os that they were using for everything and like all the little time stamps and date stamps and like numbers and things on screen all Matched up and made sense like model numbers on the sides of aircraft.

1013
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:30,543
Speaker 1: matter They didn't matter, but they were self-consistent.

1014
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:32,193
Speaker 0: all this nerd What you know.

1015
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:35,190
Speaker 0: I'm sure that someone's gonna go through and they're gonna find errors in the movie.

1016
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,130
Speaker 0: Everyone always does but you can find errors in gundam seed.

1017
00:57:38,251 --> 00:57:39,336
Speaker 1: But what did gundam seed do?

1018
00:57:39,738 --> 00:57:41,829
Speaker 1: the tech is there if you care about it?

1019
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:45,201
Speaker 1: It's self-consistent, but it doesn't get in the way of the real movie.

1020
00:57:45,321 --> 00:57:51,860
Speaker 0: I also like how they didn't do any like Stupid restrictions on things just for the sake of the plot.

1021
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:54,387
Speaker 0: You know it's like everything just sort of made sense.

1022
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:55,470
Speaker 0: like they came in.

1023
00:57:55,871 --> 00:58:00,702
Speaker 0: It's like they push the button to wake him out of the thing and then Yeah, it didn't like.

1024
00:58:00,803 --> 00:58:01,143
Speaker 0: oh now.

1025
00:58:01,183 --> 00:58:02,466
Speaker 0: It's broken the.

1026
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:07,220
Speaker 0: you know they didn't do anything silly like oh You can't use it between the hours of three and six.

1027
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:07,722
Speaker 0: or you know.

1028
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:09,590
Speaker 0: you know they didn't make any stupid.

1029
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:14,690
Speaker 0: You know exceptions for no reason other than to create a plot point or plot device.

1030
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,954
Speaker 0: They just you know they.

1031
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:19,444
Speaker 0: they put all the plot devices into into things that were okay.

1032
00:58:19,685 --> 00:58:27,230
Speaker 0: You know as opposed to just Nonsensical arbitrary technical limitations for the sake of plot devicing none of that occurred which was acceptable.

1033
00:58:28,174 --> 00:58:28,435
Speaker 1: I will.

1034
00:58:28,736 --> 00:58:30,824
Speaker 1: it was though all plotting everything aside.

1035
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:32,250
Speaker 1: It was pretty freakin beautiful.

1036
00:58:32,894 --> 00:58:33,941
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty much.

1037
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:35,390
Speaker 0: You know it's one of those things.

1038
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:36,577
Speaker 0: It's like the antenna movie.

1039
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,963
Speaker 0: not you know it was better than you tend to movie But you know the art book ness of it is definitely well above the.

1040
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:45,110
Speaker 0: you know the plot story ness of it.

1041
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,779
Speaker 0: You know as an art book it gets like a plus plus.

1042
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's like at least in terms of the year.

1043
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:52,977
Speaker 0: I wonder how you know it will hold up.

1044
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:57,070
Speaker 0: Yeah in the year 2025 am I gonna look at this and will it look away?

1045
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:01,681
Speaker 0: Will it look the way that like a PlayStation game looks now?

1046
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:03,727
Speaker 1: well, I mean even I'm not.

1047
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:13,619
Speaker 1: that long ago like a year ago I've randomly watched like a big chunk of the third Lord of the Rings movie a lot of that CG really doesn't hold up Really like.

1048
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:14,910
Speaker 1: it kind of bothered me of course.

1049
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,538
Speaker 1: I think part of the reason it doesn't hold up.

1050
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:19,110
Speaker 1: is that it holds up if you watch it in the theater.

1051
00:59:19,712 --> 00:59:26,646
Speaker 1: But like on a TV a lot of stuff really stands out especially if you've already seen the movie And you're not kind of immersed in it in the big screen.

1052
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:27,932
Speaker 1: this of it Mmm.

1053
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:31,727
Speaker 1: I don't think avatar would hold up as well if you were watching it on a little TV without 3d.

1054
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:33,276
Speaker 0: No, it would probably.

1055
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:35,270
Speaker 0: it would probably hold up like you know for a few years.

1056
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,848
Speaker 0: But I don't think it'll hold up in the long run, but look how far we've come.

1057
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:40,563
Speaker 1: We have come far.

1058
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:46,667
Speaker 1: this movie Was a huge jump in terms of the popular perception of what is possible with CG.

1059
00:59:46,827 --> 00:59:47,770
Speaker 0: the thing is right.

1060
00:59:47,911 --> 00:59:51,889
Speaker 0: Is that the thing with CG is like if even fancy Lord of the Rings CG?

1061
00:59:52,452 --> 00:59:54,749
Speaker 0: Right doesn't hold up after a few years.

1062
00:59:55,256 --> 00:59:56,310
Speaker 0: It's sort of like man.

1063
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:56,491
Speaker 0: It's.

1064
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:59,370
Speaker 0: it came so far and it's still not holding up.

1065
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:03,590
Speaker 0: But the thing is the Pixar stuff like Toy Story 1 holds up cuz it's not as realistic.

1066
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:09,007
Speaker 0: It's more stylized right, but 2d stuff even fucking snow white holds up cuz it's also stylized.

1067
01:00:09,027 --> 01:00:12,650
Speaker 1: the more stylized You are the long or it's kind of like taking something.

1068
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,630
Speaker 0: So what you're saying when you try to make it realistic.

1069
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:19,106
Speaker 0: Then you lose your ability to hold up whether it's 2d or 3d or even in computer or hand.

1070
01:00:19,126 --> 01:00:21,837
Speaker 1: you do this with culture stuff To like look at back to the future.

1071
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:26,513
Speaker 1: Emmett and I were talking about this because it was made so 80s in the 80s.

1072
01:00:26,614 --> 01:00:29,266
Speaker 1: you know when it was in the 80s it was present-day future past.

1073
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:30,230
Speaker 1: you watch it today.

1074
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:31,573
Speaker 1: It's not present-day future past.

1075
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:33,238
Speaker 1: It's 80s future past.

1076
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:39,653
Speaker 1: yep very specifically 80s like late eight like it feels so late 80s Kind of me you know.

1077
01:00:40,255 --> 01:00:44,167
Speaker 1: and but other movies like there are a lot of old Hitchcock movies even that could be today.

1078
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:47,221
Speaker 1: Yep Absolutely, I think we've talked about this a lot.

1079
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,550
Speaker 1: We're not a movie review podcast.

1080
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,870

1082
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:58,389
Speaker 0: now We don't really watch so many movies that aren't a 9 and we're starting to watch man.
