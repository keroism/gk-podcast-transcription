1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,467
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, January 12th, 2012.

2
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:16,020
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:17,986
Speaker 0: I'm Riff.

4
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:20,340
Speaker 1: You're going slowly for no reason.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,500
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,289
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Magfest 2012.

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,453
Speaker 1: Uh... Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,350
Speaker 1: So, you know what?

9
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,590
Speaker 1: On Monday, we do not have to go to work.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,168
Speaker 1: Do you know why?

11
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:35,430
Speaker 0: Uh, MLK Day?

12
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:36,168
Speaker 1: That is correct.

13
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:42,930
Speaker 1: You know that on the list of federal holidays, at least incredibly major holidays, that most people get days off for, right?

14
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:43,289
Speaker 1: Yup.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,170
Speaker 1: Only two of them are days for specific human beings.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,509
Speaker 1: There is Martin Luther King Day.

17
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:49,188
Speaker 0: Yup.

18
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:50,307
Speaker 1: Well, Martin Luther King Jr.

19
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:50,449
Speaker 1: Day.

20
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:50,908
Speaker 0: Yes.

21
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:52,469
Speaker 1: And Columbus Day.

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,970
Speaker 0: We used to have... Now we have President's Day.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,470
Speaker 1: President's Day is not for a specific person.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,230
Speaker 0: I know, but it was two different people.

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:58,788
Speaker 1: It was.

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,369
Speaker 1: But anyway... Uh... Martin Luther King is awesome.

27
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,629
Speaker 1: Columbus is a dick.

28
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,989
Speaker 1: We have a day for a really good person and a day for a really shitty person.

29
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:09,686
Speaker 1: So I was trying to think, well...

30
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,250
Speaker 0: Why don't we have a day for a middle-of-the-road person?

31
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:12,825
Speaker 1: No.

32
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,930
Speaker 1: Here's the real question that came up at work.

33
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,529
Speaker 0: Why isn't there Norman Borlaug Day?

34
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:18,367
Speaker 1: No.

35
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:20,270
Speaker 1: Here's the real question.

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,690
Speaker 0: Okay.

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:30,090
Speaker 1: Can you come up with an American better than Martin Luther King, or even as good as, to replace the Columbus Day?

38
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:36,150
Speaker 0: Wow, my brain went through a gigantic list of people who were all disqualified for not actually being American.

39
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,729
Speaker 0: That's correct.

40
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:39,530
Speaker 0: Is Norman Borlaug American?

41
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,348
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

42
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,309
Speaker 0: I don't actually know, and I feel stupid now.

43
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,388
Speaker 0: We're on both Wikipedia-ing.

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,669
Speaker 1: It says he was.

45
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:51,529
Speaker 0: Ah, we got it.

46
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,130
Speaker 0: That was easy.

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,709
Speaker 1: Find a third person.

48
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,889
Speaker 0: I already got... I got one.

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:55,888
Speaker 0: Goalpost.

50
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,648
Speaker 0: Can't move 'em.

51
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,384
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, there's not many.

52
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,550
Speaker 0: Well, we got one, so why don't we switch?

53
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,370
Speaker 1: Americans are mostly shitty.

54
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,990
Speaker 0: No, we've had some good people, like, uh... I don't know, a lot of the founding founders.

55
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:07,907
Speaker 0: FDR?

56
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:10,128
Speaker 1: That was one that I thought of.

57
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,949
Speaker 0: FDR's pretty good.

58
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,010
Speaker 0: Hell, Teddy Roosevelt.

59
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,250
Speaker 1: I don't think Teddy Roosevelt deserves a day.

60
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,870
Speaker 0: Does he deserve it more or less than Christopher Columbus?

61
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, I deserve one more than Christopher Columbus.

62
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:31,330
Speaker 0: Thing is, you know, I'm down with the hate on Columbus, but at the same time, a lot of the bad stuff that happened as a result of him was not intentional on his part.

63
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:35,469
Speaker 1: Then why don't we have, say, I don't know, Leif Erikson Day?

64
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:36,908
Speaker 0: I don't know.

65
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:37,648
Speaker 0: Why don't we?

66
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,029
Speaker 1: Or Eric the Red Day?

67
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:49,649
Speaker 0: Possibly because there are a lot of Italian communities that actually lobby pretty heavily to keep Columbus Day celebrated in places that tried to stop celebrating it.

68
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:52,829
Speaker 1: We'll tell those Italian communities we're gonna change it to Marco Polo Day.

69
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:54,189
Speaker 0: Marco!

70
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:00,530
Speaker 0: So CES is happening, and nah.

71
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:01,427
Speaker 1: Yep.

72
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:01,776
Speaker 1: Nah.

73
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:02,790
Speaker 1: There is nothing.

74
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:03,226
Speaker 1: Eh.

75
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:12,930
Speaker 1: Except... Except... I was looking, you know, 'cause it's tons of CES news, you can't avoid it, but you mostly just breeze past most of it 'cause it's almost useless completely.

76
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:21,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just had a nice talk in the forum about how most of this stuff is companies manufacturing a product and then trying to manufacture a demand for said product.

77
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,270
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, that's how you have to do it, right?

78
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,289
Speaker 1: 'Cause the demand doesn't exist before you make it.

79
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,030
Speaker 0: Well, there is demand for things, but no one makes them.

80
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,710
Speaker 0: And actually, I wonder why some things don't get made sometimes.

81
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:38,150
Speaker 1: It's because, and I've said this a lot recently, but it seems to me, this is just... I don't want to take this on a tangent, so let me say this without a reply.

82
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,510
Speaker 1: Do not reply to what I'm going to say, and then I will do my news, right?

83
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:41,661
Speaker 1: I'll.

84
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,830
Speaker 1: If you look around the world these days, right?

85
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,090
Speaker 1: We talk about the 1%.

86
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,770
Speaker 0: Look around the world these days.

87
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,650
Speaker 1: All the companies have all the money.

88
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,150
Speaker 0: All the companies have all the money.

89
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,647
Speaker 1: Stop it.

90
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,224
Speaker 1: Okay.

91
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:58,190
Speaker 1: All the money is in all the bank accounts of the companies, not even the 1% people, the companies, right?

92
00:03:58,491 --> 00:03:59,708
Speaker 1: Normal people have no monies.

93
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,449
Speaker 1: It's companies that have all the monies.

94
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,270
Speaker 1: Like, you know, Apple has billions in the bank.

95
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,449
Speaker 1: Google, billions in the bank, right?

96
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,910
Speaker 0: So most of the business is business to business.

97
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:06,589
Speaker 1: That's right.

98
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:23,290
Speaker 1: If you are a business and you want to make money, you should have businesses as your customers, not people, because you can get one customer that's a business and get a zillion dollars, or you can spend a lot of money on marketing and on crazy expense to get enough real people customers who each give you five bucks.

99
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,010
Speaker 0: That's why day job I'm in that business, because the B2B has its own acronym for a reason.

100
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:28,570
Speaker 1: Right.

101
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,449
Speaker 0: Actually, that's technically an initialism.

102
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:45,690
Speaker 1: Which is why even products that are consumer products these days, such as, you know, electronics, do more to serve other corporations, which will say pay for advertising on those products or such and such, than they do to serve the people buying those products.

103
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,250
Speaker 0: So anyway, to keep the tensions away, there was one cool thing at CES.

104
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,168
Speaker 1: There was one semi-cool thing at CES, or at least worthy of discussing, and that is Boxy Live TV.

105
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,089
Speaker 1: So what this is, is if you have a Boxy box, you can buy this thing for 50 bucks.

106
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:02,570
Speaker 1: I don't know why they didn't come out with a new Boxy box that has this integrated.

107
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:02,987
Speaker 1: They will.

108
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:03,649
Speaker 1: Maybe they will.

109
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,408
Speaker 0: Or maybe the Boxy box hardware is not selling well enough to be worth it.

110
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:11,250
Speaker 1: And it's a USB on one side and a coax on the other.

111
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,570
Speaker 1: So it's small, but it's a lot like a video capture card, but it's actually doesn't do plain old video capture.

112
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:26,209
Speaker 1: What you need to do is plug into it either an antenna for the air or clear q-cam, which is what I have, which is unencrypted cable TV.

113
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:34,450
Speaker 1: So it's just a TV tuner card with a USB, but Boxy provides an interface, the new version for this particular thing.

114
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:41,196
Speaker 1: So even though you'll be using, you know, just over-the-air TV, you don't interact with it in the same way.

115
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,949
Speaker 1: you interact with over-the-air TV, which is changing channels and whatnot.

116
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,930
Speaker 0: So here's the big question.

117
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,453
Speaker 1: You got the.

118
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:52,030
Speaker 1: you're basically using the Boxy awesome interface to watch over-the-air live television in an awesome way.

119
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,890
Speaker 0: So here's the big question live television.

120
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:55,909
Speaker 0: All right, I can see that.

121
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:05,150
Speaker 0: I mean, I, you know, maybe I want to watch the game, but does Boxy now automatically do DVR type stuff, which is I don't think so, which is like why not?

122
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,750
Speaker 1: Myth TV has done that for DVR stuff over a decade.

123
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:27,410
Speaker 0: I think it's literally 99% of the reason why I would want to use this because if I have a Boxy box or a computer plugged into my TV already, and I'm going to plug the coax into the same TV, why even bother putting it through the Boxy box if all I'm going to do is watch the live thing anyway?

124
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm still trying to understand this.

125
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,650
Speaker 1: like Myth TV, right, has been around since, let's see, when was Myth TV created?

126
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:37,507
Speaker 1: In '02, started in April '02.

127
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,230
Speaker 1: So for 10 years, Myth TV has been a free DVR that you can install on any computer to turn it into a DVR.

128
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:45,837
Speaker 1: How come?

129
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,330
Speaker 1: no other product is doing this?

130
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:55,530
Speaker 1: Every DVR is either like one that comes with your cable or it's like, you know, freaking TiVo, which you had to pay a monthly fee or some nonsense.

131
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,590
Speaker 0: Well, you had to pay a monthly fee at least at one point.

132
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,310
Speaker 0: Why doesn't someone just sell-- It's got for the network information, so it actually had a list of all the shows.

133
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:08,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, but why doesn't someone just pay, you know, just sell computers that already have Myth TV on them?

134
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:10,122
Speaker 0: Why doesn't someone?

135
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:10,589
Speaker 0: I'll tell you why.

136
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,830
Speaker 0: One, you'd probably get sued by media companies again.

137
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:18,409
Speaker 1: All you're selling is computers, which is legal to sell computers, and it's legal to sell Myth TV.

138
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:19,350
Speaker 0: Ah, so here's the thing.

139
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,750
Speaker 0: If I were making a device like that-- And Linux.

140
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:33,530
Speaker 0: The primary feature I'd introduce is straight-up automatic commercial blocking coupled with straight-up, you know, in case a commercial wasn't blocked by accident, the 30-second, minute, whatever sketch.

141
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,810
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna distribute Myth TV's latest stable release on a stable Linux that it works on with hardware that I know it works with.

142
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,570
Speaker 0: Also, Myth TV is really hard for normal people to use.

143
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,070
Speaker 1: And Ponzi also, and a remote.

144
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:57,510
Speaker 0: And I would argue that the majority of the market who is capable of dealing with a DVR that doesn't hold their hands the entire way, 100%, is also the kind of person who is just pirating everything from Pirate Bay anyway.

145
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,330
Speaker 0: See, this is why-- Why even bother with the stupid broadcast TV?

146
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,310
Speaker 1: That's why, you know, people are worried, right?

147
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,830
Speaker 1: You know, a really killed Myth TV is piracy.

148
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,810
Speaker 1: Why should I bother DVRing shit on this download?

149
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:15,070
Speaker 0: Yup, even though they have the same effect, because do you really think that people don't just skip the commercials when they DVR something?

150
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, so BoxyLiveTV, like, good idea.

151
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:20,450
Speaker 1: But, A, it only works with BoxyBox.

152
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,030
Speaker 1: You can't use it with a PC running Boxy, even with the new version.

153
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,790
Speaker 0: Now, speaking of which, independent of that-- Two, it doesn't, you know, you can't, say, use encrypted cable.

154
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,470
Speaker 1: Like, if you take a cable, put it into your cable box, and then take a cable out of that, it won't work.

155
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:33,149
Speaker 1: It has to be unencrypted cable.

156
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,510
Speaker 1: And three, well, yeah, it's 50 bucks.

157
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,568
Speaker 1: It should be, yeah.

158
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, so this is cool, but I think it's a terrible product.

159
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,570
Speaker 1: I do-- The one thing, though, is it does put a good user interface on live TV.

160
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,056
Speaker 0: Does it really?

161
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,170
Speaker 0: What is the user interface?

162
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,510
Speaker 1: It looks like a TV guide, only using the Boxy remote.

163
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,770
Speaker 0: So where does it get the data?

164
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,390
Speaker 1: I don't know where it gets the data.

165
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,089
Speaker 1: Because TiVo, you-- No one's been discussing that.

166
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,069
Speaker 0: Pay for that data.

167
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,770
Speaker 1: I know, no one has been discussing where that data comes from.

168
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,448
Speaker 0: Maybe Boxy made a deal, and that's why it costs 50 bucks, but even

169
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:13,030
Speaker 1: then-- But it looks like Boxy, it has little preview screenshots of every show, it says what time they start, it says whether they're HD, lets you share what you're watching on Twitter, you know, and it's got everything.

170
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,369
Speaker 1: All the descriptions of all the shows.

171
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:20,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, but does it let me save it in a, you know, nice format that I can then use to make a PMV?

172
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:21,987
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

173
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:24,269
Speaker 0: Ah, so it doesn't do anything I care about.

174
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:25,370
Speaker 0: Awesome.

175
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,450
Speaker 0: So right along these lines, I just want to point out that there's this article, because CES, a whole bunch of manufacturers are talking about making smart TVs.

176
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,750
Speaker 1: And when they say smart TV, what they basically mean-- A TV that sort of already has Boxy in it without a Boxy box, but worse than Boxy.

177
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,567
Speaker 0: I'm gonna translate exactly what this is.

178
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:55,697
Speaker 0: They want to make TVs with really shit, slow-ass interfaces that let you see a tiny subset of the censored content on the internet in a painful, slow, and tedious way.

179
00:09:55,717 --> 00:10:05,710
Speaker 0: that will not be used by anyone who has the skills to use a real computer hooked up to their TV, nor will it be used by anyone who doesn't have those skills, because they won't be able to figure this out either.

180
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:10,589
Speaker 0: And you know what, the TV I have now, really nice, gigantic TV.

181
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:17,290
Speaker 0: It has, like, Yahoo bullshit in it, and if I plug an ethernet cable into it, it says it can play videos.

182
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,908
Speaker 0: Fuck if I could get it to work.

183
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,890
Speaker 0: And I'm a senior, I'm a fighting professional.

184
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,329
Speaker 1: Well, you're a glorified clock setter.

185
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,330
Speaker 1: I'm surprised your TV tells good times.

186
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,639
Speaker 0: So I got a web browser to start, right?

187
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,406
Speaker 0: After, like, five minutes, it loaded.

188
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:32,190
Speaker 0: It was just that slow.

189
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,190
Speaker 1: I don't understand why these things, cable boxes, are the worst.

190
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,150
Speaker 1: It's like you push down, down, down, down, down, and down.

191
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:43,703
Speaker 1: It's like Boxxy, at least, is immediately responsive.

192
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,490
Speaker 1: You push the button, it goes d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

193
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,098
Speaker 0: So I tried to get it to stream some video from my NAS.

194
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:53,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not playing an MKV, or an MP4, or, you know what, any fucking format that I have.

195
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:54,539
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,070
Speaker 0: And it was just completely useless.

197
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,010
Speaker 0: Outerly, absolutely useless.

198
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:06,268
Speaker 0: And I don't know, like, I don't think there's any market for this at all, because literally, I think, everyone who's smart enough to use something like this,

199
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:11,310
Speaker 1: Who out there has a whole bunch of videos that they want to watch on the TV that are in the format that TV's gonna play?

200
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:11,886
Speaker 0: I know.

201
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:12,850
Speaker 1: That he's gonna use it.

202
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,790
Speaker 0: And there's no way anyone will get the licensing agreements to sell a TV that actually will just play the formats that people typically have.

203
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,410
Speaker 0: And even then, there might be lawsuits about piracy, enablement, or whatever.

204
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,850
Speaker 0: And the interface is just, like, they're guaranteed to be crappy, because without a keyboard, you're not gonna be able to search for stuff.

205
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,870
Speaker 1: And Apple TV has a good user interface, but it can only play, like, Apple things.

206
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,469
Speaker 0: And even worse, let's talk about Boxxy.

207
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,290
Speaker 0: Boxxy has these little apps, right, that let you see content.

208
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,930
Speaker 0: I pretty much had to give up on using Boxxy for anything but anime that I happen to already have downloaded.

209
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:46,610
Speaker 0: Because it does that really well.

210
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,181
Speaker 1: I use it for the Crunchyroll app also.

211
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,329
Speaker 1: It's pretty much the anime app here.

212
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,622
Speaker 0: Ah, but the Crunchyroll app.

213
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:51,470
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the apps.

214
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,348
Speaker 0: Crunchyroll app.

215
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,210
Speaker 0: This is not a problem for me or Scott, because I know how to use the mute button on my TV remote.

216
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,690
Speaker 0: But I want to point out that if you watch a show and an ad comes on, you can't skip it, obviously.

217
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,930
Speaker 0: And they disable your volume control until the ad stops.

218
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,609
Speaker 1: Well, the app does that.

219
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,232
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

220
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:09,599
Speaker 0: The app does that.

221
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,805
Speaker 0: But that's still bullshit.

222
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:11,850
Speaker 0: That angers me.

223
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,190
Speaker 0: So as a result, why don't I just watch it on the Crunchyroll website?

224
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,704
Speaker 1: Because on the Crunchyroll website, it's the same thing.

225
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:17,765
Speaker 1: Ad.

226
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:26,230
Speaker 1: And you're not gonna tell me that pushing the mute button in the Crunchyroll video player is more convenient than pushing the mute button on your TV remote.

227
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,650
Speaker 1: You're gonna do the same thing and have the same problem.

228
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,790
Speaker 0: I have to go find my TV remote every time, because in Boxee, I got the Boxee remote out, not the TV remote.

229
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,630
Speaker 0: The point of the Boxee remote was that I didn't need to also use the TV fucking remote.

230
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,890
Speaker 1: Well, I have, like, a bunch of remotes, and I gotta use the, you know, the remote from my speaker system.

231
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I have three remotes, and I have a Bluetooth keyboard and a USB keyboard.

232
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,930
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, if your problem is too many remotes, right, Boxee remote doesn't solve that problem.

233
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,040
Speaker 1: No.

234
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,030
Speaker 1: Boxee remote solves the problem of I want a keyboard without having to have a keyboard.

235
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,490
Speaker 0: But Boxee remote doesn't have any way to do the mouse, so unless you're in Boxee, it's still pretty useless.

236
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Boxee remote doesn't solve that problem.

237
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,390
Speaker 1: If the problem you want to solve, which is the problem of I have too many remotes, you have to get the Logitech Harmony.

238
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,281
Speaker 1: The Logitech Harmony is amazing.

239
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:09,610
Speaker 1: People don't know about this thing.

240
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,917
Speaker 1: Basically, it's a lot of setup in the beginning, right?

241
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:19,910
Speaker 1: You have to set it all up, and it might be too hard for people who aren't techy, but it should be, if you know how to set up your home theater yourself, you can set up the Logitech Harmony.

242
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:31,630
Speaker 1: And what you do is you program it to be like, okay, listen, if I want to watch a DVD, you gotta turn on the DVD player, you gotta put the TV on video 3, and you gotta turn on the receiver and set the receiver to audio input 4.

243
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:44,770
Speaker 1: And then you program all that, and then you push the DVD, after you program it, you push the DVD button on the Logitech Harmony, and it will turn off everything that's not the DVD player, turn on the DVD player, and set all those inputs, and you'll do it with one button press, because you programmed it.

244
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:58,424
Speaker 1: And then you'll be like, okay, if I want to do the Wii, you gotta set the receiver to audio 5, and set the TV to video 1, and you program that in, and you have a Wii button, you push the Wii button, and your TV's in Wii mode, it turns the DVD player off, turns the Wii on, all

245
00:13:58,444 --> 00:13:58,766
Speaker 0: that stuff.

246
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,490
Speaker 0: So anyway, all the apps, the CollegeHumor app doesn't have all the CollegeHumor videos, it only has their originals.

247
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,490
Speaker 1: That's CollegeHumor's fault.

248
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,750
Speaker 0: No, it's the app's fault, alright, alright, it's the app's fault, again, I'll give it that.

249
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,610
Speaker 1: CollegeHumor could have made their app include everything.

250
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,152
Speaker 0: Let's get to that.

251
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:15,070
Speaker 0: The YouTube app, one, I can't close those pop-up ads.

252
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,610
Speaker 1: It's slower than using real YouTube.

253
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,830
Speaker 0: It's slower, and the search results are different.

254
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,528
Speaker 1: Well, that's because you're not logged in.

255
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,689
Speaker 0: No, even if I, yeah, so how do I log in?

256
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,308
Speaker 1: You don't.

257
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,794
Speaker 1: Yeah.

258
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,170
Speaker 1: You're logged into Boxee, you're not logged into YouTube.

259
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,203
Speaker 0: Again, that's the app's fault.

260
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:29,587
Speaker 0: You know what?

261
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,890
Speaker 0: Communism didn't work so well as implemented by Russia, or China, or anyone in the world.

262
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,263
Speaker 0: But I guess it's just those implementations' fault.

263
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,370
Speaker 0: The idea must be sound.

264
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,530
Speaker 1: That's not the same thing.

265
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,208
Speaker 0: Just like Boxee.

266
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:49,430
Speaker 0: I find that Boxee is utterly useless to me compared to a web browser on the TV, because I just can't do stuff.

267
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,170
Speaker 0: And the Xbox, you think, all right, there's a YouTube thing in the Xbox.

268
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:53,750
Speaker 1: That's even worse than Boxee.

269
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:04,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really want to put together an expose, because I've done a bunch of side-by-side searches, and a shit ton of YouTube content is just missing if you use the Xbox 360.

270
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,030
Speaker 0: And it seems to align with certain companies' ownership of the stuff in the videos.

271
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,722
Speaker 0: Like, it's not just logged in, not logged in.

272
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:14,030
Speaker 0: There's something else going on there.

273
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,960
Speaker 1: How about Bidoof?

274
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,710
Speaker 1: Can you watch Bidoof?

275
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:17,043
Speaker 0: Oh my god, Bidoof.

276
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:17,589
Speaker 0: Why?

277
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,250
Speaker 1: He's so angry that he can't watch Bidoof on Xbox.

278
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:21,206
Speaker 1: He's as angry as Bidoof.

279
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,255
Speaker 1: He's got a gun.

280
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,344
Speaker 1: He's shooting Microsoft.

281
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:24,049
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

282
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:28,450
Speaker 1: Oh, now he's up in the cloud with your save games.

283
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,269
Speaker 0: All right, so I guess we should get on with the main thing, but I do want to talk about this, because it's kind of funny, but also sad.

284
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,410
Speaker 0: You know what they're doing to Kim Jong Il's body?

285
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:36,250
Speaker 1: What?

286
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,568
Speaker 0: They're Lenin-ing him.

287
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:38,250
Speaker 1: Okay.

288
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:40,430
Speaker 0: There's going to be a Lenin body.

289
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,710
Speaker 1: That's what they did with his dad, too.

290
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,029
Speaker 0: Apparently, his dad's body is interred there, but isn't visible, according to this one article.

291
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,489
Speaker 1: What I heard is that the dad's body, they had to get this Russian dude.

292
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:52,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have Russian guys doing this one, too.

293
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,110
Speaker 1: He's like the most expensive dude, but he can get the job done to make it look kind of okay.

294
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:57,602
Speaker 0: Yep.

295
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,609
Speaker 0: So they put him in his jumpsuit, and they put him in this thing, and he's sitting there with his little toes sticking up under a red sheet.

296
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,330
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

297
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:19,108
Speaker 0: We've done a bunch of PMVs and AMVs for things of the day over the years, so I think it's time for a PPGMV.

298
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:20,189
Speaker 1: Okay.

299
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:26,610
Speaker 0: This is a Powerpuff Girls music video set to Him, the best character.

300
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,430
Speaker 1: Him is the best.

301
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:37,530
Speaker 0: Him, aka Akio in transvestite lobster form, is pretty much everything I like about Powerpuff Girls, as horrifying as that is.

302
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,890
Speaker 1: I don't know why Him isn't in every episode.

303
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,890
Speaker 0: There's just something about Him.

304
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,988
Speaker 1: There's so many Mojo Jojo episodes, and I was like, "Yeah, he's not that

305
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:44,210
Speaker 1: great.".

306
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,228
Speaker 1: And then, it's like, "Well, Him should be the guy who's on all the episodes all the

307
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:48,490
Speaker 1: time.".

308
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:48,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

309
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:49,810
Speaker 0: Anyway.

310
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:51,150
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

311
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:51,910
Speaker 0: This is pretty funny.

312
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,310
Speaker 1: See, here's an awesome Flash game.

313
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,122
Speaker 1: It's called "Let's Play" colon "Ancient Greek

314
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:56,564
Speaker 1: Punishment.".

315
00:16:58,471 --> 00:16:59,830
Speaker 0: Oh my God, do I get to be Sisyphus?

316
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,830
Speaker 1: You can be Sisyphus, Tantalus, Prometheus, Dunaides, or Zeno.

317
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:07,869
Speaker 0: Do you want to reveal what the deal with this game is, or let people play it?

318
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:12,670
Speaker 1: Well, you play out the ancient Greek tortures of these various ancient Greeks.

319
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:13,266
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

320
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,309
Speaker 0: So, play these games and let us know when you win.

321
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,709
Speaker 1: I'm filling the bath to wash away my sins.

322
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:21,290
Speaker 0: Here I go.

323
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,029
Speaker 0: How's that going for you?

324
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,249
Speaker 1: I got the water.

325
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,130
Speaker 1: I'm dumping it in the bath.

326
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,241
Speaker 1: All right, the bath is 20% full.

327
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,310
Speaker 1: I'm going back to get more water.

328
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,510
Speaker 1: Oh, the bath is full of holes.

329
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,830
Speaker 0: Try to push that rock up the hill.

330
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,649
Speaker 0: I heard that one's easier.

331
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:33,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll try that one.

332
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:40,230
Speaker 1: Actually, the one where you got to scare the birds away from pecking away your liver.

333
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,070
Speaker 0: I could win that one with a drinking bird.

334
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,496
Speaker 1: Yeah.

335
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,450
Speaker 0: I guess the drinking bird would eventually falter.

336
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,890
Speaker 0: Also, drinking birds don't work unless they're dipping their beaks in some liquid.

337
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:49,809
Speaker 0: So, no.

338
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:50,349
Speaker 0: But, anyway.

339
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:52,330
Speaker 0: That's it.

340
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,127
Speaker 0: Pretty good.

341
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,790
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the book club book is two books, which we'll be doing soon.

342
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:57,627
Speaker 1: Real soon.

343
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,348
Speaker 0: Real soon.

344
00:17:58,652 --> 00:17:59,349
Speaker 1: Next week, probably.

345
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,029
Speaker 0: They're your books.

346
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,164
Speaker 1: Yup, it is.

347
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,628
Speaker 1: The Little Prince.

348
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,333
Speaker 0: By.

349
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,149
Speaker 1: Antoine de Saint-Ejupéry.

350
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:08,170
Speaker 1: And also, Wind, Sand, and Stars.

351
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,707
Speaker 1: Il sait magnifique.

352
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:10,969
Speaker 1: By the same person.

353
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,849
Speaker 0: They're amazing books.

354
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:12,969
Speaker 0: Straight up.

355
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,810
Speaker 0: I just got to tell you.

356
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,308
Speaker 0: You should read them.

357
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:14,788
Speaker 1: And short.

358
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:15,445
Speaker 1: Ish.

359
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,170
Speaker 0: They're really short.

360
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,849
Speaker 0: The Little Prince, you can read in, like.

361
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,630
Speaker 0: A couple hours.

362
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:19,508
Speaker 0: A half hour.

363
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:23,010
Speaker 0: If you read it, like, quickly, ten minutes.

364
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,910
Speaker 1: I don't know, ten minutes.

365
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,190
Speaker 0: You could read that book in ten minutes.

366
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,250
Speaker 0: I don't know, ten minutes.

367
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,269
Speaker 0: You might not grock it.

368
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,830
Speaker 1: Maybe, like, a couple hours.

369
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,070
Speaker 0: You could read all the words in, like, ten or fifteen minutes.

370
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:35,570
Speaker 1: Okay.

371
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:35,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

372
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:40,829
Speaker 0: We are going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo East, doing stuff like we always do.

373
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:43,490
Speaker 0: And if you didn't buy a badge, well, you fought because it sold out.

374
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:44,990
Speaker 0: You should have bought it a long time ago, like we said.

375
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,990
Speaker 1: You can go to Anime Boston instead.

376
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:46,787
Speaker 1: It's not sold out.

377
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,121
Speaker 0: Yep.

378
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,430
Speaker 0: And I'm going to advertise.

379
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,790
Speaker 0: I'm looking for a system administrator.

380
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,908
Speaker 0: Linux and Windows in New York.

381
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:52,848
Speaker 0: Email me.

382
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,928
Speaker 1: You know, we're still not getting paid for this.

383
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:54,629
Speaker 0: Email me.

384
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,309
Speaker 1: This is not cool.

385
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:56,089
Speaker 0: I'll give you a job.

386
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,770
Speaker 0: You want to work for me?

387
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:57,408
Speaker 0: I'm a cool guy.

388
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,090
Speaker 1: It's not cool.

389
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:58,788
Speaker 0: I'm a cool guy.

390
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,769
Speaker 1: We still haven't.

391
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,408
Speaker 1: We need to discuss this.

392
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:00,907
Speaker 0: Or girl.

393
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,547
Speaker 1: We need to discuss this.

394
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,210
Speaker 0: Otherwise, conventions are off in the distance.

395
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,650
Speaker 1: Nerd NYC recesses this weekend.

396
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,530
Speaker 0: Yes, Nerd NYC recesses this weekend.

397
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,210
Speaker 0: Scott will not be there because he's a little baby and has laundry to do and hair to wash.

398
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,029
Speaker 1: Hey, what hair to wash?

399
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:17,808
Speaker 0: I will be there.

400
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,310
Speaker 0: On Saturday only.

401
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,809
Speaker 0: I will be running one game in the evening slot, which I already ran at Burning Apocalypse Con to accolades.

402
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:31,629
Speaker 0: And if you want to be in that game, well, good luck because there's only four slots and a lot of people want to be in that game.

403
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,570
Speaker 0: But I will play in some other games.

404
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,050
Speaker 0: I'll be there.

405
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,509
Speaker 0: I'll hang out.

406
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:34,968
Speaker 0: I'll say hi.

407
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,405
Speaker 1: It'll be cool.

408
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,870
Speaker 1: One other game because that's all you get at recess is two games.

409
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,370
Speaker 0: I think there's three games on Saturday.

410
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,235
Speaker 0: Whoa.

411
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:41,528
Speaker 0: I don't know.

412
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:42,830
Speaker 0: I haven't read any of the stuff.

413
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,629
Speaker 0: I'm just going to show up.

414
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,169
Speaker 0: But anyway.

415
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,808
Speaker 0: That's it.

416
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:46,470
Speaker 0: That's it.

417
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:46,935
Speaker 1: What?

418
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,049
Speaker 1: That was pretty bad.

419
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,530
Speaker 0: I'm still hurt from Magfest.

420
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,922
Speaker 0: My throat is still not 100% back.

421
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,288
Speaker 1: So we went to Magfest X.

422
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,070
Speaker 0: We have been to two Magfests.

423
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,670
Speaker 0: Magfest is the third best gaming con there is.

424
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:10,230
Speaker 0: If you count both PAXes as one and you count Kineticon's gaming as its own con.

425
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:11,369
Speaker 1: What about Essen?

426
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,629
Speaker 0: I've never been to Essen, so it doesn't exist.

427
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:14,629
Speaker 1: That we've been to.

428
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, that we've been to.

429
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,399
Speaker 1: Magfest, if you don't know, it's a four day, 24/7 music and gaming fest.

430
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,010
Speaker 1: Not only is there gaming of all kinds, there is music of all kinds.

431
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,829
Speaker 1: This is a con.

432
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,690
Speaker 1: Well, of gaming kinds.

433
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,550
Speaker 0: Where you go to a con and you have two full days of conning and then you realize when you wake up the next day, it's only Saturday.

434
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,190
Speaker 0: And you have two more full days of conning.

435
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:40,949
Speaker 0: And you know what?

436
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,770
Speaker 0: A lot of people show up Wednesday.

437
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:43,684
Speaker 1: Yeah.

438
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:50,350
Speaker 0: I mean, we showed up Thursday like early afternoon and there were already a lot of people there.

439
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,729
Speaker 0: We'd already missed a lot of gaming.

440
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's only a kind of a few thousand people, like five, six, seven thousand, something like that.

441
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard that it was like six-ish thousand, which was a lot.

442
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:05,590
Speaker 0: It was like 80% more than last year because they were limited by the venue last year, which was this tiny little crap hotel in the middle of nowhere.

443
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,970
Speaker 0: Now, they're in a weird venue.

444
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:09,687
Speaker 1: Yeah.

445
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,669
Speaker 1: It's the Gaylord, which you've known about for a long time, but haven't been to yet.

446
00:21:13,312 --> 00:21:14,089
Speaker 0: KazuKan is there now.

447
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

448
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,930
Speaker 0: It is enormous, but not in the way that the BCEC is enormous.

449
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,290
Speaker 0: The BCEC, where PAX East is, is like a hangar for spaceships.

450
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:25,870
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,390
Speaker 0: Or perhaps a spaceship.

452
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:34,670
Speaker 0: It is three gigantic, like gargantuan rooms and then a whole bunch of other stuff.

453
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:41,990
Speaker 0: The BCC is like a long city filled with all different kinds of spaces.

454
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:53,050
Speaker 0: The Gaylord can only be described as something wrought from corruption on a civic level, coupled with grand visions of a 90s convention center.

455
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,430
Speaker 1: It's such a weird place because it's so fake.

456
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,089
Speaker 0: It has a fake town around it and a fake town in it.

457
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,369
Speaker 1: It's so strange.

458
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,630
Speaker 0: We could do a whole show on this place that we were in.

459
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,330
Speaker 1: But this place had to be created with mad corrupt moneys from somewhere.

460
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,408
Speaker 1: I don't know.

461
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,650
Speaker 0: The best we can say.

462
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:18,710
Speaker 1: If you look at it on Google Street View, you see it while it was still in construction, which is really strange.

463
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,550
Speaker 0: Once I get the video up from this con, you'll see what we mean.

464
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:26,030
Speaker 0: I don't want to dwell on it, but it was an odd place.

465
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:46,768
Speaker 0: It's kind of like if you took Roosevelt Island in New York City and put all the tourist places from New York, not the tourist attractions, like the real things like the Statue of Liberty, but all the kind of like shit-tier tourism like the South Street Seaport Mall and all those kind of like the TGI Fridays and stuff in Times Square and put

466
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:47,270
Speaker 1: all that.

467
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:57,410
Speaker 1: And a really crappy part of Disney World, not rides, but like a character breakfast and a scenic walkthrough with animatronics.

468
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:04,506
Speaker 0: You built a town just for that, multiplied it by corruption, and then let some commuters live there.

469
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,870
Speaker 0: It's weird, and I don't know what my opinion is of it.

470
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:11,050
Speaker 0: I don't know what to say anymore.

471
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:13,627
Speaker 0: And I don't want to review it.

472
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,110
Speaker 0: I want to review MagFest.

473
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:20,447
Speaker 0: But suffice it to say, if you go to MagFest next year or you go to Katsu-Con, you'll see what we mean.

474
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:37,570
Speaker 0: It was really weird how many people came to this place on Saturday, not for MagFest, not for any other convention that was going on at the same time, but literally just to like go around the town and eat at the restaurants and like go to the character breakfast.

475
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:40,550
Speaker 0: This was like a resort destination for some people.

476
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:41,369
Speaker 0: Very strange.

477
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was weird.

478
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,790
Speaker 1: Anyway.

479
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:50,088
Speaker 1: So the bad things we had to say about MagFest are the same bad things we probably said the last time.

480
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,690
Speaker 0: Yes, when we review cons, we try to get everything bad we have to say out first.

481
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,270
Speaker 0: Do we?

482
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,949
Speaker 1: I don't know.

483
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,550
Speaker 1: In the past, we'd go look and listen.

484
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:56,874
Speaker 0: No, we try.

485
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,290
Speaker 0: We forget.

486
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,989
Speaker 1: I haven't listened to our previous MagFest show from the MagFest 9, but I'm pretty sure we said the same things.

487
00:24:04,372 --> 00:24:06,090
Speaker 0: No, one's coming off the list, but we'll get to that.

488
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,709
Speaker 1: All right, anyway.

489
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,549
Speaker 1: Reg still sucks.

490
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,430
Speaker 0: It was not nearly as bad as last year.

491
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,309
Speaker 0: But still sucks.

492
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:11,474
Speaker 0: Yes.

493
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,270
Speaker 0: The Reg situation at MagFest is unacceptable.

494
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,490
Speaker 1: Yes.

495
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,390
Speaker 0: In fact, we got to wait in the very short, like special line.

496
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:19,908
Speaker 0: And you know what?

497
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,610
Speaker 0: It still took a while, like a half hour.

498
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need that line to be way shorter.

499
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:26,969
Speaker 0: Mail the badges.

500
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:28,190
Speaker 0: Just mail them, guys.

501
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,730
Speaker 0: You can do it.

502
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,427
Speaker 0: Mail them also.

503
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:30,829
Speaker 0: I will help you do it.

504
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,328
Speaker 0: Email me.

505
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,029
Speaker 0: I will personally help you do it.

506
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:40,270
Speaker 1: You could also just have, if you just had twice as many people doing the badge things and you shorten the process to where it was like, "Bam, here's your badge.

507
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:40,857
Speaker 1: Bam, here's your

508
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:41,142
Speaker 1: badge.".

509
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,070
Speaker 1: Then you'd be better.

510
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,881
Speaker 1: The one thing they did improve, though, from last year is.

511
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:49,390
Speaker 1: last year, it was like specific badges were pre-numbered for all the people.

512
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,190
Speaker 1: That was a disaster.

513
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,830
Speaker 1: So they had to find your badge.

514
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:53,749
Speaker 1: This year, it was just like, "Here's your fucking badge.

515
00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:54,886
Speaker 1: It's just the next one in the

516
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:55,129
Speaker 1: pile.".

517
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:56,629
Speaker 1: And that sped things up a bit.

518
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:57,144
Speaker 1: Yes.

519
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,990
Speaker 1: But it's still major problems.

520
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,297
Speaker 0: Also, if the con grows at all, they're going to hit the Otacon situation of, "All right, we got 30,000 people.

521
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:05,345
Speaker 0: We got to give badges

522
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:05,528
Speaker 0: to.".

523
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:15,850
Speaker 1: They're also still doing legally questionable things like making you sign a waiver and checking your ID and putting a wristband on you, which other conventions do not do.

524
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,510
Speaker 0: Actually, a lot of tiny, small shit conventions do some of that stuff.

525
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:20,489
Speaker 1: Big conventions don't.

526
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:27,710
Speaker 1: So I'm saying, I've heard rumors, I don't know how true this is, that someone on the MAGFest staff is sort of a lawyer and that they do this stuff.

527
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,910
Speaker 1: But it's like, "Listen, you need to get a real lawyer.

528
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,290
Speaker 1: You have 7,000 people going to a big fancy hotel.

529
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,788
Speaker 1: Get a real lawyer to tell you what to

530
00:25:34,829 --> 00:25:34,930
Speaker 1: do.".

531
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,450
Speaker 1: Because I'm pretty sure, I'm the lawyer, obviously.

532
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, we are not lawyers.

533
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,550
Speaker 1: We are not giving you legal advice.

534
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,208
Speaker 1: But based on my convention experience from other conventions, I'm pretty sure that's not what you do.

535
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,750
Speaker 1: Yeah.

536
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,167
Speaker 0: The waiver, for one, in my non-lawyer opinion, means nothing.

537
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:55,404
Speaker 0: You might as well hand them a piece of paper that says nothing on it and asking them to sign it.

538
00:25:56,191 --> 00:26:00,609
Speaker 0: Two, this bracelet thing we talk about, when you register, they take your ID.

539
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,290
Speaker 0: And when I say they, I mean just some con staffer.

540
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:13,530
Speaker 0: And they put on you either a different colored wristband you're supposed to wear the whole weekend, that designates whether or not you're 18 and/or 21.

541
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,930
Speaker 0: The goal is so that people who do room parties don't have to worry about IDs for drinking and that no statutory rape occurs.

542
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:28,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that by doing an ID check, that the con is now responsible if the wristbands get switched up, which is trivial for them to be.

543
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:32,230
Speaker 0: Also, the staffer, you know, I refuse to put on the wristband.

544
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,870
Speaker 1: I also refuse to put on the wristband.

545
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,069
Speaker 0: And the staffer gave me shit, but you know what?

546
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,190
Speaker 0: One, I'm not wearing a wristband for the whole con, especially if it has no function.

547
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,550
Speaker 1: Especially if it's mad uncomfortable.

548
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,610
Speaker 0: And it has no function in the con itself.

549
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,730
Speaker 0: And that is totally a lawsuit waiting to happen.

550
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,749
Speaker 0: MagFest, I love you.

551
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,448
Speaker 0: I don't want you to get sued.

552
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,710
Speaker 0: Do not offer this service.

553
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:52,790
Speaker 0: I agree, it's an awesome service.

554
00:26:53,170 --> 00:27:00,170
Speaker 0: I love the fact that when people came to our room party we were hanging out in, one guy had a blue wristband, so we were like, yeah dude, sorry, not giving you any beer.

555
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,789
Speaker 0: But, uh, yeah.

556
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,389
Speaker 0: Legally.

557
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,830
Speaker 1: That dude could have easily swapped that wristband for a green one if he wanted.

558
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,370
Speaker 0: Yes, and we probably could have gone after you if we'd gotten in trouble for that.

559
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,010
Speaker 1: That's right.

560
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:19,328
Speaker 0: So, while it's all cool, and I applaud the idea as being an awesome idea in practice, fucking don't do it.

561
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:19,722
Speaker 1: Yup.

562
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,790
Speaker 1: Secondly, they have a major problem with Securitad.

563
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:35,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, they, this year, they had, now it's interesting because this is a complaint we have about most conventions we go to in that they really don't know how to handle the fact that people will try to steal their stuff from their arcades or whatever.

564
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,588
Speaker 1: It's really easy.

565
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,310
Speaker 1: Everything's bolted down.

566
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:38,829
Speaker 1: The end.

567
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,029
Speaker 1: That way no one can take it.

568
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:48,647
Speaker 0: So what MagFest did this year is if you went into the main hall, which was tabletop, vending, arcade, and consoles all in one area, so pretty much 90% of the con.

569
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,570
Speaker 1: The whole con, except for concerts.

570
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,150
Speaker 0: If you walked in with any bag, they demanded to search your bag.

571
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:55,050
Speaker 0: And if you had a laptop or anything like that?

572
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,588
Speaker 1: Well, it was weird.

573
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,870
Speaker 1: It's like if you walked in there with any sort of electronic thing, they wanted to check it into their system and put a barcode on your bag.

574
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not putting a sticker on my laptop, dude.

575
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, screw you.

576
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:05,969
Speaker 1: It's not happening.

577
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,490
Speaker 0: And then on the way out, they would search your bag and give you shit if you had a laptop.

578
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:14,290
Speaker 0: And it was just a disaster waiting to happen on so many fronts.

579
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:16,610
Speaker 1: I would purposely go down there without anything.

580
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,090
Speaker 1: I never brought my laptop in there or anything so I could avoid being searched.

581
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,230
Speaker 1: And half the time when I walked out of the room, they wanted to look at my stuff.

582
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,770
Speaker 1: And when they looked, they just glanced.

583
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,868
Speaker 1: They didn't really look.

584
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,310
Speaker 0: So it basically, it annoyed everyone.

585
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,850
Speaker 1: So it just annoyed me for no reason.

586
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,830
Speaker 1: And half the time, they didn't even ask to look.

587
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,910
Speaker 1: I just managed to sneak out without getting looked at.

588
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,390
Speaker 1: And then it was like, well, if you're going to let people sneak out, why even bother?

589
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,489
Speaker 0: It was a giant pain.

590
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:40,448
Speaker 1: Just don't do it.

591
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:48,090
Speaker 0: Two, well three, I guess the final thing, which is kind of part and parcel of this, is that they kind of made up rules inconsistently throughout the con.

592
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:53,810
Speaker 0: All con, I would go out and buy a Starbucks in the convention and then take it back into tabletop.

593
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,290
Speaker 0: And at one point on Saturday, I came back with a coffee I'd just bought.

594
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,821
Speaker 0: And they're like, you can't bring that in here.

595
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:00,670
Speaker 0: No open containers.

596
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:02,169
Speaker 0: Out of nowhere.

597
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,170
Speaker 0: And they made me throw it away before they let me in.

598
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,630
Speaker 1: We had been eating and drinking in there the whole con, by the way.

599
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,530
Speaker 0: And they claimed it was because they didn't want me to spill something on the consoles, even though I was going to tabletop.

600
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:21,530
Speaker 0: But two, while I was being, they demanded I throw away my coffee, a guy walked in with like three Subway sandwiches and three Subway drinks, and the same person let him go right through.

601
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,045
Speaker 1: Yup.

602
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,408
Speaker 0: So seriously, guys.

603
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,510
Speaker 1: Here's my suggestion to you, Magfest.

604
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,590
Speaker 1: The only thing you have to worry about, right, is your console stuff being stolen.

605
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,550
Speaker 1: No one's going to steal an arcade machine, right?

606
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,870
Speaker 1: The dealers can protect their own shit, as long as you have security walking around.

607
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:37,790
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

608
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,950
Speaker 0: The dealer area is in the rest of the con shared space, so they can't just lock the room at the end of the night.

609
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,870
Speaker 0: They need to really put the dealers in a separate area.

610
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,189
Speaker 1: Well, that's definitely true.

611
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,310
Speaker 0: But that's just, they need to get bigger.

612
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,649
Speaker 0: They obviously couldn't get the space for them.

613
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,390
Speaker 0: They can grow organically.

614
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:59,422
Speaker 1: But anyway, the point is, it seemed like Magfest was worrying about attendees stealing other attendees' things, and it's like, Magfest, don't worry about that.

615
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,330
Speaker 1: Attendees are going to have their shit stolen if they're stupid, and that's their problem.

616
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,310
Speaker 1: It's not your problem.

617
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,010
Speaker 1: Just be like, well, tough shit, right?

618
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,629
Speaker 1: It's like, you didn't protect your shit.

619
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,390
Speaker 0: But the moment you try to help, the moment you try to do the right thing, you think it's cool.

620
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to protect everyone's stuff.

621
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,030
Speaker 0: Just like, yeah, we're going to try to make sure that underage kids don't drink.

622
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,649
Speaker 1: All you're doing is pissing off people like us with hassling us.

623
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,750
Speaker 0: Well, more importantly, again, one could argue that you are assuming liability if something does get stolen.

624
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:27,610
Speaker 1: But we're not lawyers.

625
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:33,230
Speaker 0: Even though you have this fake waiver that probably, in our non-lawyer opinion, doesn't mean anything.

626
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, all you got to do is protect your own console equipment by bolting it the fuck down, right?

627
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,568
Speaker 1: And if you got wireless shit, you need someone standing there taking care of it.

628
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,130
Speaker 0: They didn't protect any of the tabletop stuff.

629
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,687
Speaker 0: I mean, I walked in with like 15 games.

630
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't even have a tabletop checkout.

631
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:54,770
Speaker 1: Heels was like, oh my god, this tabletop is just games on a table with no one protecting it on total honor system, right?

632
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,109
Speaker 1: It's like, I walked in and out with board games all night.

633
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:57,969
Speaker 0: One time.

634
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,289
Speaker 1: Nobody was checking to see if those board games I was walking out with belonged to the library or were mine.

635
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,309
Speaker 0: One time, someone stopped me and said, are those all yours?

636
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:05,006
Speaker 0: And I was like, yes.

637
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,030
Speaker 0: And I just kept walking.

638
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:07,890
Speaker 0: And I think he tried to stop me, but I just kept going.

639
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:08,709
Speaker 0: And they were all mine.

640
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, yeah.

641
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,369
Speaker 0: Okay, so guys, here's the cool thing.

642
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:16,650
Speaker 0: That is literally every complaint I have about MagFest.

643
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,810
Speaker 1: Everything about MagFest on the net is the awesomest.

644
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,730
Speaker 0: Oh my god, MagFest was one of the best cons I've been to since PAX.

645
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,250
Speaker 1: Oh my god, playing games until five in the morning.

646
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:24,608
Speaker 1: Dude, guys.

647
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,970
Speaker 1: Then waking up to do a panel at 10 in the morning.

648
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:28,050
Speaker 1: On Thursday.

649
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,230
Speaker 1: A super art fight.

650
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,209
Speaker 0: On Thursday, a little after midnight, we sat down to learn and then play Eclipse.

651
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:36,970
Speaker 1: Well, some of us already knew how to play.

652
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:37,690
Speaker 0: I didn't know how to play.

653
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,010
Speaker 0: At 5am, we ended that game.

654
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,930
Speaker 0: I was victorious.

655
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,962
Speaker 0: And then, at 10.30am, we did a panel.

656
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,609
Speaker 1: Eclipse is fucking awesome.

657
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:46,850
Speaker 1: We talked about that on Tuesday.

658
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,850
Speaker 0: So here, let's talk about MagFest.

659
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:57,010
Speaker 0: We can obviously, if you want to know the vibe or what MagFest is like and all that, you can listen to our previous episode on MagFest.

660
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,130
Speaker 0: Because really, almost none of that changed.

661
00:31:59,452 --> 00:31:59,541
Speaker 1: Nope.

662
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,010
Speaker 0: It's the same vibe, same culture, same people, same arcade.

663
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,810
Speaker 0: All that same stuff is just as awesome, if not more awesome, than it was last year.

664
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,730
Speaker 0: So let's talk about what's different.

665
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:10,165
Speaker 0: One.

666
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,668
Speaker 1: More space, which means that there was no B.O.

667
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:12,910
Speaker 1: smell.

668
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, last year, the B.O.

669
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,090
Speaker 0: problem was out of control.

670
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,009
Speaker 0: This year?

671
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,982
Speaker 1: I got a B.O.

672
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:18,450
Speaker 1: problem.

673
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:19,047
Speaker 1: This year.

674
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,518
Speaker 1: I got a B.O.

675
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:20,149
Speaker 1: problem here.

676
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,197
Speaker 0: There was effectively no B.O.

677
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:24,870
Speaker 0: other than the occasional fat guy walking by me.

678
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:26,850
Speaker 1: I don't think the problem was different people.

679
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,884
Speaker 1: I think there was still B.O.

680
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:28,210
Speaker 1: people.

681
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,790
Speaker 1: I think it was just simply that there was so much space and so much air and so much ventilation.

682
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,450
Speaker 1: Dude, the ceilings were like 30 feet high.

683
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:33,977
Speaker 0: The B.O.

684
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:34,770
Speaker 0: would go up there.

685
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,630
Speaker 1: There was no way you were going to smell the B.O Unless you were like, even at the DDR machine, you weren't going to smell it.

686
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,430
Speaker 0: That was crazy.

687
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,070
Speaker 0: There were a ton of DDR and Bemani machines.

688
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:44,850
Speaker 0: And you know what?

689
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:50,350
Speaker 0: I wanted to play DDR and there were people playing DDR continuously all night.

690
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,089
Speaker 0: Even Thursday.

691
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,370
Speaker 0: All night.

692
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:52,970
Speaker 0: And you know what?

693
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,620
Speaker 1: You can go 3

694
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:53,925
Speaker 1: a.m.,

695
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:54,229
Speaker 1: DDR.

696
00:32:55,191 --> 00:33:01,884
Speaker 0: Even when the dude in the fursuit was doing 8 and 9 foot maniac songs on the machine, there was no B.O.

697
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:02,530
Speaker 0: smell anywhere.

698
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,570
Speaker 0: I was kind of amazed.

699
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,704
Speaker 0: Because I'd go to an arcade and there'd be B.O.

700
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:06,630
Speaker 0: at the DDR machine.

701
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,160
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there was B.O.

702
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,050
Speaker 1: smell in the fursuit.

703
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it didn't get out and it's all I care about.

704
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:13,569
Speaker 0: It's all I care about.

705
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:15,110
Speaker 1: They had some awesome games.

706
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,950
Speaker 1: They had Initial D3, which is the one I've played the most, which is good.

707
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,710
Speaker 1: 6 is better.

708
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,328
Speaker 0: 5 is better.

709
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:20,049
Speaker 0: 4 is better.

710
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:20,630
Speaker 0: You know what?

711
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:21,648
Speaker 0: I sat down and played it.

712
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:23,009
Speaker 0: 3 is enough.

713
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,068
Speaker 0: That'll do, pig.

714
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,130
Speaker 1: 3 is still pretty fucking great.

715
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:26,990
Speaker 1: I can't imagine.

716
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,729
Speaker 1: I've played 4 a couple times.

717
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:31,510
Speaker 1: 5 and 6, I can't even imagine how awesome they are.

718
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,490
Speaker 0: They had 2 X-Men machines instead of 1 this year.

719
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,089
Speaker 0: One didn't work.

720
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,290
Speaker 0: They got it fixed at one point.

721
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,607
Speaker 0: Did they?

722
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:36,509
Speaker 0: I think it broke again.

723
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,570
Speaker 1: The pinballs they had were great, but there were people playing them the whole time.

724
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,510
Speaker 1: You'd wait in such line to get pinball going on.

725
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,310
Speaker 0: You had to wait to play DDR and Initial D the whole time, too.

726
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:44,989
Speaker 0: Except Thursday.

727
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,524
Speaker 1: Yup.

728
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,289
Speaker 0: I played all the Initial D I could on Thursday.

729
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,630
Speaker 1: They had 2 magical drops in Neo Geos, actually.

730
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,310
Speaker 0: They had 2 Dig Dugs side by side, 2 ice cold beers side by side.

731
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:54,830
Speaker 0: The arcade was the best.

732
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,090
Speaker 1: One of the ice cold beers didn't really work.

733
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:57,810
Speaker 1: But it only was missing Rampart.

734
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:58,624
Speaker 0: So last year...

735
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,950
Speaker 1: Only Rampart or Initial D 4, 5, 6 could have improved that arcade.

736
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,230
Speaker 0: Last year I mused...

737
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:03,708
Speaker 1: And more pinball.

738
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,830
Speaker 0: How come PAX has a crap arcade compared to Magfest?

739
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,268
Speaker 0: And this year I realized why.

740
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:18,469
Speaker 0: The machines failed and broke at a surprising... Not a surprising, but a pretty good rate relative to the number of people playing them at this con.

741
00:34:18,911 --> 00:34:21,389
Speaker 0: And they had people fixing them constantly, but you could see...

742
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,510
Speaker 1: They got ahead of the game.

743
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,449
Speaker 1: Because the problem is they were basically still sort of setting them up when we got there on Thursday, right?

744
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,030
Speaker 1: They didn't have them completely set up and all repaired when the con started.

745
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,170
Speaker 1: So even though the con started, they're still getting some of them up to working that weren't working on arrival.

746
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,982
Speaker 0: So Magfest, let's say it had 6,000 people.

747
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,329
Speaker 1: It's like they didn't start out at 100% working.

748
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:45,409
Speaker 1: They started out at like 67% working and they had to build up as they were using them.

749
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,562
Speaker 0: Let's say Magfest had 6,000 uniques.

750
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:47,148
Speaker 0: Let's just say.

751
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,668
Speaker 0: Okay.

752
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,856
Speaker 0: A PAX has what?

753
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:49,280
Speaker 0: 15 to 20,000 uniques?

754
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:50,737
Speaker 1: Yep.

755
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:57,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would need like 4 Magfest arcades or else all the machines would fail.

756
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:57,978
Speaker 1: Here's the solution.

757
00:34:58,383 --> 00:34:58,828
Speaker 1: You ready for my...

758
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,749
Speaker 0: Four arcades?

759
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,829
Speaker 1: I got a few solutions.

760
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,570
Speaker 0: Fill that third empty hangar with an arcade?

761
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,493
Speaker 1: Here's my solutions.

762
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:04,734
Speaker 1: Ready?

763
00:35:04,774 --> 00:35:09,270
Speaker 1: Number one, you have so many games that even if everyone's using them like crazy...

764
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:11,170
Speaker 0: Pinkie Pie, that's a lot of games.

765
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:11,539
Speaker 1: That is.

766
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,949
Speaker 1: Solution number two, get a lot of guys.

767
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,130
Speaker 1: Because remember, if you're getting that many games, you're bringing in Videotopia and the ACAM and the Retro...

768
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:19,775
Speaker 0: That's what I say.

769
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,529
Speaker 0: You bring in multiple groups and set up...

770
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,090
Speaker 1: And they're basically, you're bringing in Pinball Joe.

771
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,430
Speaker 1: You're bringing in everyone and all they've got, they're bringing their whole crews.

772
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,090
Speaker 1: You have enough people who can fix the machines all at once.

773
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:30,910
Speaker 0: And PAX has the money to pay for that, I think.

774
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,780
Speaker 1: And some of the machines are really durable.

775
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:34,390
Speaker 1: Your Dig Dug's not going to go down.

776
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,310
Speaker 1: Only your ice cold beer and your pinballs are going to go down.

777
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,809
Speaker 1: Anyway, number three.

778
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,450
Speaker 1: Every machine, at least, will be free except the really popular ones.

779
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,146
Speaker 1: Set them on 25 cents mode and all the money goes.

780
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:47,730
Speaker 1: child's play.

781
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,177
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

782
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:50,246
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

783
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,850
Speaker 1: If it's a machine that's not really getting played, make it free.

784
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,768
Speaker 1: But the machines that are getting played like crazy, you don't need to make Dig Dug 25 cents.

785
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,228
Speaker 1: I mean, that's bullshit, right?

786
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,354
Speaker 1: But, DDR, 25 cents.

787
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:01,139
Speaker 1: Initial D, 25 cents.

788
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,330
Speaker 0: I'm used to paying a dollar for Initial D, gladly.

789
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,054
Speaker 1: Street Fighter 2, free.

790
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:11,788
Speaker 1: Super Street Fighter 4, whatever, Turbo, Hundreds, whatever, 25 cents.

791
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,260
Speaker 1: No more than 25 cents, obviously.

792
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:15,045
Speaker 1: But 25 cents.

793
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,930
Speaker 0: What about Fatal Fury?

794
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:24,910
Speaker 1: And then, those games, a guy will have to go around collecting the quarters, so he'll make sure the games are still working in good condition when he goes to get the quarters.

795
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,650
Speaker 0: I wonder if there might be legal stuff around that, but anyway.

796
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,784
Speaker 1: What, having an arcade that charges a quarter?

797
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:30,590
Speaker 1: Is it totally legal?

798
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,230
Speaker 0: No, because venue licenses, it gets complicated when you do that.

799
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,090
Speaker 0: The moment you go from providing it for free to paying for it, there are legal questions.

800
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:38,793
Speaker 1: Just an idea.

801
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:39,718
Speaker 1: You just need some of these.

802
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,170
Speaker 1: These are just some ideas to make sure it goes.

803
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,081
Speaker 0: But this isn't the Pac Show.

804
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:43,750
Speaker 0: It's the MagFest Show.

805
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,650
Speaker 1: Also, bring a bunch of replacement joysticks and buttons and all that other good stuff.

806
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,909
Speaker 0: So, another new thing.

807
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,467
Speaker 1: Also, set up the arcade a day in advance so it's 100% working.

808
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,670
Speaker 0: They don't have the resources for that.

809
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,090
Speaker 1: At the start of the convention.

810
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,529
Speaker 0: Anyway, different thing number two.

811
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,910
Speaker 0: They had actual panel rooms that actually had enough seats for everybody.

812
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,550
Speaker 1: And the convention center was very good about candy and water and all that kind of stuff.

813
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:04,640
Speaker 0: That was a separate thing.

814
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,510
Speaker 0: I was talking about just the panel rooms.

815
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:06,499
Speaker 0: It's part of panels.

816
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,569
Speaker 0: You need water.

817
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,930
Speaker 0: I was going to talk about the venue separately, because I talked a lot to the convention center staff.

818
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,344
Speaker 1: Alright.

819
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:14,319
Speaker 0: So, the panel rooms were good.

820
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,690
Speaker 0: Only one room had a jank as broken projector.

821
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,610
Speaker 0: Which was good, because it let us cut down on the demoing and get to the actual discussion.

822
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,710
Speaker 1: It seemed like their systems were good and working, but it didn't seem like they had enough microphones and they were moving them around a bit.

823
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,270
Speaker 0: Which was fine, because we're loud.

824
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't even use microphones the whole panel time.

825
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,131
Speaker 0: Yep.

826
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:35,110
Speaker 0: So we did Beyond D&D, which we rewrote for like the fourth time, and it went really, really well.

827
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,803
Speaker 0: It's a good Beyond D&D.

828
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,770
Speaker 0: It amazes me though, MagFest is weird.

829
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:43,590
Speaker 0: It's a con where it's a lot of hardcore gamers who, as far as I can tell, have never read the internet about gaming.

830
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,610
Speaker 0: Like, they have never heard of any of the stuff we talk about.

831
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:54,129
Speaker 0: And one of the gaming intellectuals panels we were on, a guy was like, "I'm going to demo this crazy

832
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:54,410
Speaker 0: game.".

833
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,340
Speaker 0: And we had someone play the game.

834
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,745
Speaker 0: It was VVVVVVV.

835
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,209
Speaker 0: The majority of the people in the room had never heard of it or seen it.

836
00:37:59,511 --> 00:37:59,858
Speaker 0: So I was like,

837
00:37:59,879 --> 00:37:59,981
Speaker 0: "What?".

838
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:01,029
Speaker 1: It's on Steam, guys.

839
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, "Really?

840
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:02,407
Speaker 0: What?".

841
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:05,230
Speaker 0: I didn't really play it a lot, but I knew about it.

842
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:08,788
Speaker 0: At one point, I was like, "Yeah, so you've all played Binding of Isaac,

843
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,009
Speaker 0: right?".

844
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:10,129
Speaker 0: Like, nobody had.

845
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:10,985
Speaker 1: Yep.

846
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:11,629
Speaker 1: Nobody.

847
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:17,690
Speaker 1: This is why you need to listen to Geek Nights, so that you will be taken into the future.

848
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,550
Speaker 1: Dude, you listen to Geek Nights?

849
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,830
Speaker 1: We're basically living in the future.

850
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,504
Speaker 0: And you go to MagFest, you will be a god.

851
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,808
Speaker 0: You'll walk around and be like, "Hey, you want to play this game called Burning

852
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:28,150
Speaker 0: Wheel?"

853
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:30,090
Speaker 0: And you will amaze people.

854
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,807
Speaker 0: Hell, you could be like, "Hey, you want to play Settlers of

855
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:34,230
Speaker 0: Catan?".

856
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,725
Speaker 0: And a lot of people will be like, "Oh my god,

857
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:36,068
Speaker 0: wow.".

858
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:36,357
Speaker 0: Yeah.

859
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:36,735
Speaker 0: Wow.

860
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,230
Speaker 1: The tabletop library at MagFest is kind of sad.

861
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,369
Speaker 1: That's why you got to bring your own.

862
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:41,469
Speaker 0: It was okay.

863
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,530
Speaker 0: There were a lot of good games there.

864
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,550
Speaker 1: But people love to play games there.

865
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,270
Speaker 1: So if you bring your own games, it's totally awesome.

866
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,490
Speaker 0: They had a good mix of really weird old games.

867
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:51,710
Speaker 1: I guess what it is is they have pretty much one of each of the standbys.

868
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,030
Speaker 1: They had two power grids in Agricola, a bunch of Settlers, a Carcassonne.

869
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,970
Speaker 0: Three Puerto Ricos.

870
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,190
Speaker 1: Right, some Puerto Ricos.

871
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,429
Speaker 1: So it's pretty much like, "Well, we don't need

872
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:57,510
Speaker 1: any.".

873
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,468
Speaker 0: They had all the Dominions.

874
00:38:59,194 --> 00:38:59,469
Speaker 1: That's true.

875
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,710
Speaker 1: They had one of every Dominion set.

876
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,350
Speaker 1: So it's like, it's not so exciting to us.

877
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:09,830
Speaker 0: But they had like old Candyland and like crazy weird... They had the old Battle Star Galactica and this weird Astro Boy game.

878
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,190
Speaker 0: It was more like a lot of people played Candyland.

879
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:12,541
Speaker 0: You know why?

880
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,590
Speaker 0: They'd probably never actually played Candyland before.

881
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,328
Speaker 0: And there's something fun about playing a weird, crappy game at a con drunk at 5 a.m.

882
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,569
Speaker 0: with four strangers.

883
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,869
Speaker 1: I saw people playing Monopoly.

884
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:23,538
Speaker 0: Yeah.

885
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,570
Speaker 1: But it was a pretty meager library.

886
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,365
Speaker 1: But they had, you know, the basics.

887
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,059
Speaker 1: The staples.

888
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:30,809
Speaker 0: It was pretty good though.

889
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,410
Speaker 1: It was okay.

890
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:33,290
Speaker 1: Bring your own tabletop games to MAGFest.

891
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,189
Speaker 0: So let's talk about panels a little bit.

892
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,870
Speaker 0: MAGFest has a weird panel culture.

893
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,770
Speaker 0: Partly because I think the con grew out of kind of its own culture.

894
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,710
Speaker 0: Kind of like how PEX grew out of Necro Womacon and its own culture.

895
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,810
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, Katsucon, Otacon, Anime Boston, all these kind of like standby cons.

896
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,950
Speaker 0: Or like all the gaming cons or generic con and everything.

897
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:56,482
Speaker 0: They grew out of a sort of shared culture.

898
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,050
Speaker 0: so they kind of do things the standard way.

899
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:02,970
Speaker 0: The panels culture at MAGFest is really weird.

900
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,529
Speaker 0: People in the audience just like shout stuff and just say things.

901
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,030
Speaker 0: They'll be like, they want to just like interact.

902
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,267
Speaker 0: Like they want to just talk to you.

903
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:15,290
Speaker 0: And for the discussion panels it was fine because we have a moderator.

904
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,550
Speaker 0: And the audience like raised their hand and wanted to say something.

905
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,110
Speaker 0: But, you know, we did Beyond D&D, a straight up lecture.

906
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:23,610
Speaker 0: And half the audience kept like raising their hand.

907
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,009
Speaker 0: They didn't yell stuff out, they just raised their hand.

908
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,850
Speaker 0: And we ignored them because that's what we do.

909
00:40:28,476 --> 00:40:29,570
Speaker 0: We don't engage with the audience.

910
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,869
Speaker 0: They kept their hands up the whole hour.

911
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,090
Speaker 0: One girl, I felt bad for, she raised her hand, raised her hand, raised her hand.

912
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:41,850
Speaker 0: Switched to the other hand, started holding it up with the other hand at the elbow.

913
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,050
Speaker 0: It's like, look, if it's not obvious...

914
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,674
Speaker 1: One guy even opened his mouth, he's like, can I say... I'm like, no.

915
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,450
Speaker 1: All I said was no and just kept going.

916
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,149
Speaker 0: But after that, you know what he did?

917
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,209
Speaker 0: Raised his hand.

918
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,484
Speaker 1: Well, this other guy raised his hand and it's like.

919
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:58,450
Speaker 1: he didn't realize that we weren't going to address anyone in the audience at any time for the entire panel.

920
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,749
Speaker 1: We didn't address a single person, but he thought somehow we were going to address him.

921
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,970
Speaker 0: But anyway, we got video of all the panels and lectures we were on.

922
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,230
Speaker 0: And we're going to get them on YouTube as soon as I can edit them together.

923
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:10,556
Speaker 0: And that's it.

924
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:11,283
Speaker 0: They were really fun.

925
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:11,970
Speaker 0: They were really interesting.

926
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,240
Speaker 0: I think my favorite one was.

927
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,728
Speaker 0: it was me, Scott, and Dr.

928
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:19,690
Speaker 0: Hazard just talking about like monetization models of games for an hour.

929
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:21,450
Speaker 1: And going off on tangents that were off topic.

930
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:23,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was way fun because I really like talking to him.

931
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,270
Speaker 0: And we didn't get to see him and talk to him for more than like two minutes for the whole con.

932
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,270
Speaker 0: So the first time we see him to actually talk to him is on this panel.

933
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:35,828
Speaker 0: So it was just us and him talking to each other in front of an audience for an hour.

934
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:36,230
Speaker 0: It was great.

935
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:36,987
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

936
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:37,530
Speaker 0: Yeah.

937
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:39,359
Speaker 0: Ran into a lot of awesome people.

938
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:39,781
Speaker 0: John St.

939
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:40,344
Speaker 0: John was there.

940
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:41,470
Speaker 0: We didn't even get to say hi.

941
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,517
Speaker 0: But yeah, dude.

942
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, he did his thing.

943
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,977
Speaker 1: You know, I've been to two MAGFES so far.

944
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:47,350
Speaker 1: I still haven't seen James Rolfe, not even from far away.

945
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,810
Speaker 1: I saw a line to see him, but I didn't see him through that line.

946
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,111
Speaker 0: Yep.

947
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:56,890
Speaker 0: The last time I talked to him was when I invited him to be on our failed late show attempt at PAX.

948
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,528
Speaker 0: And then the follow up email when he was like, "Yeah, I'm not going to be at

949
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:00,789
Speaker 0: PAX.".

950
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,777
Speaker 0: I was like, "Oh, that's fine.

951
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,026
Speaker 0: We just flew someone else in.

952
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:03,328
Speaker 0: We'll see

953
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:03,530
Speaker 0: him.".

954
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,462
Speaker 1: He was at the last PAX, I think.

955
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:06,830
Speaker 1: Because he made a video about it.

956
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:09,490
Speaker 0: For whatever reason, we didn't get a chance to talk to him.

957
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,822
Speaker 0: I think we had a panel at the same time.

958
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:11,368
Speaker 0: His panel?

959
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:11,610
Speaker 0: I forget.

960
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,510
Speaker 1: I don't even know anymore.

961
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,475
Speaker 0: Something came.

962
00:42:13,778 --> 00:42:15,410
Speaker 0: There was a reason why we didn't go talk to him.

963
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,990
Speaker 1: Biggest fan of this guy, but we never see this guy.

964
00:42:18,191 --> 00:42:19,663
Speaker 0: I know, and it's weird.

965
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,530
Speaker 0: We're in the same circles.

966
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:24,810
Speaker 0: He lives kind of near some people we know, and there's parties where people have been.

967
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,209
Speaker 1: He's at the same conventions we're at.

968
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,690
Speaker 0: Yep, we're both doing lectures and speaker stuff.

969
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,090
Speaker 0: But it's like, for all this overlap, we never talk.

970
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,410
Speaker 0: Kind of like how we know Dave Riley and Joel, but yet we never see them physically.

971
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,868
Speaker 0: We only talk to them on the inner tubes.

972
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:38,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's how it goes.

973
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,450
Speaker 0: Even though Dave's right there, like in Brooklyn.

974
00:42:41,473 --> 00:42:42,710
Speaker 1: He didn't go to our New Year's party.

975
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,890
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the venue from a convention perspective.

976
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:51,690
Speaker 0: It's technically in Maryland, which is the same place that Otacon is at with the BCC.

977
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:59,950
Speaker 0: The convention center staff, not the con staff, the convention center and the hotel, was brilliant.

978
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,521
Speaker 0: They were so competent and cool and collected.

979
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,909
Speaker 0: I was amazed how professional they were.

980
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,329
Speaker 1: They're getting paid with mad crab monies.

981
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,349
Speaker 0: Compared to the disastrous staff at the BCC.

982
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:12,615
Speaker 0: Yeah.

983
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,230
Speaker 0: Like Otacon.

984
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,670
Speaker 1: Well, there's nothing wrong with Maryland, right?

985
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,550
Speaker 1: It's Baltimore.

986
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:17,818
Speaker 1: Yep.

987
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:18,608
Speaker 1: That's a problem.

988
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:24,250
Speaker 0: But it's sad because, you know, half my complaints about Otacon are actually complaints with the BCC staff.

989
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,069
Speaker 0: And Baltimore.

990
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,688
Speaker 1: And you know what?

991
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:26,649
Speaker 1: And the security people they get.

992
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,890
Speaker 0: There's nothing Otacon can do about that.

993
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:29,689
Speaker 0: I know the deal.

994
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,750
Speaker 1: I know the red shirts, the brown shirts, the green shirts, the yellow shirts.

995
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:33,707
Speaker 1: No, they can't.

996
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,368
Speaker 1: Yes, they can.

997
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:41,930
Speaker 0: No, because in the BCC, with the union rules and whatever, so they can choose from a number of vendors of security.

998
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,630
Speaker 0: And as far as I can tell, they're all actually the same.

999
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,370
Speaker 1: You can pay a whole lot more money to get out of that.

1000
00:43:47,912 --> 00:43:49,307
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can at the BCC.

1001
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,190
Speaker 1: There is always a way to pay money to get a different term on your contract.

1002
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,770
Speaker 1: Not always.

1003
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:03,209
Speaker 1: Because basically what you'd have to do is you'd have to pay that union as much as you would if they worked, then not have them work and instead also pay, say, Blackwater to come and do the security.

1004
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:03,829
Speaker 0: Okay, yes.

1005
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,570
Speaker 0: There is a ludicrous and infeasible way.

1006
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,810
Speaker 1: I said, I didn't say there was, I wasn't saying it was a feasible way.

1007
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,529
Speaker 1: I said there was a way.

1008
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:14,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you can't get a badge to PAX, you could just found your own convention just as good as PAX and run it just for you.

1009
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,067
Speaker 1: That's feasible.

1010
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:16,889
Speaker 1: Yes, you could.

1011
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,869
Speaker 1: There is an amount of money you could actually pay.

1012
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:19,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, Scott?

1013
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:19,927
Speaker 0: There is.

1014
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:20,730
Speaker 0: It's called magfest.

1015
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:28,329
Speaker 1: It's like, if I had enough money, I could just start a PAX and set the whole thing up and get the whole thing going and do all the work.

1016
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:31,290
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I could, and Robert Coop, like, Hey, what are you doing?

1017
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,790
Speaker 1: I'd be like, I'm paying you to show up at this.

1018
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:33,329
Speaker 1: He's like, really?

1019
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:34,046
Speaker 1: I'm like, yes.

1020
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:34,669
Speaker 1: How much?

1021
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:35,510
Speaker 1: A zillion.

1022
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,169
Speaker 1: All right.

1023
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:37,708
Speaker 1: There's PAX three now, I guess.

1024
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,950
Speaker 1: Cause Scott did it with a zillion dollars.

1025
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:44,350
Speaker 1: It could happen if you had a zillion.

1026
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:49,590
Speaker 0: But yeah, the convention center staff were scary, like in a good way.

1027
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:52,530
Speaker 0: And I talked to a lot of them and they basically.

1028
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,990
Speaker 1: I talked to a lot of people who were in the town and I was like, so what's up with this fake ass town?

1029
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one girl I talked to was like, fuck if I know, I just work here.

1030
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,050
Speaker 1: This place is weird.

1031
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,590
Speaker 1: I was like, you live in this fake ass place?

1032
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,269
Speaker 0: She's like, fuck now.

1033
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,389
Speaker 1: I was like, no, I live outside.

1034
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:06,868
Speaker 1: I don't live here.

1035
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,230
Speaker 1: Cause there are weird apartments in there and stuff.

1036
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,628
Speaker 0: And people live there.

1037
00:45:10,854 --> 00:45:11,190
Speaker 1: Frightening.

1038
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,050
Speaker 0: But, uh, the, the venue is like enormous.

1039
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,490
Speaker 0: Otacon could fit in there.

1040
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:17,924
Speaker 0: I think.

1041
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:19,047
Speaker 0: I think.

1042
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,810
Speaker 0: The, the, what the trouble is, I didn't see all the space.

1043
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,590
Speaker 0: Like I know every nook and cranny of the BCC.

1044
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,610
Speaker 1: There was more space, but yeah, we weren't, there wasn't as nearly as many spaces.

1045
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:36,307
Speaker 0: Granted, Scott, I went like into some of the service corridors and I got into some of the other space.

1046
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,970
Speaker 0: There are a lot of different spaces in that convention center that were untapped.

1047
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:46,170
Speaker 1: There were many untapped spaces, but not nearly as much as the BCC.

1048
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:56,550
Speaker 0: Well, it's hard to say if it would be a suitable, like viable alternative and I have to figure that out, but to figure that out, I would have to actually like, you know, talk to the convention center and walk around it for real.

1049
00:45:57,675 --> 00:45:58,709
Speaker 0: But it's pretty big.

1050
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:00,329
Speaker 0: MagFest has a lot of room to grow.

1051
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:07,570
Speaker 0: They will run into problems other than filling the space long before they fill the space.

1052
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,470
Speaker 1: Oh, I figured out where the corrupt monies came from.

1053
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:13,223
Speaker 0: Oh, will we?

1054
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:24,969
Speaker 1: The convention center hosted the 2011 Republican National Committee winter meeting at which the 2011 Republican National Committee chairmanship election took place.

1055
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,347
Speaker 0: Duly noted.

1056
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:27,768
Speaker 1: There you go.

1057
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:28,361
Speaker 1: It opened in '08.

1058
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:30,807
Speaker 1: Oh, so maybe the corruption came in in '08.

1059
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,450
Speaker 1: It cost eight hundred and seventy million dollars to build.

1060
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:34,900
Speaker 1: Wow.

1061
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,490
Speaker 0: The one they want to build in New York is going to start at, what, a billion?

1062
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,370
Speaker 1: So, yeah, that's so corrupt also.

1063
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:43,108
Speaker 1: But you know what?

1064
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:47,110
Speaker 1: I kind of don't care because it serves, even though it's not.

1065
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:53,650
Speaker 0: If the biggest convention center in North America happens to be on the same subway line I live on, I am not going to complain.

1066
00:46:53,791 --> 00:47:02,768
Speaker 1: No matter how corrupt or evil or harmful it may be, for those five conventions a year I'll go to it for, probably, because you'll see all the conventions will move to it out of the Javits.

1067
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:08,169
Speaker 1: I'll be going to New York Comic Con there, though probably someone will start another con there.

1068
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:08,969
Speaker 1: That'll be awesome.

1069
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,370
Speaker 1: Maybe the PAX will be there once it's out of Boston.

1070
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,848
Speaker 1: Who knows?

1071
00:47:13,612 --> 00:47:13,888
Speaker 1: But, yeah.

1072
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:19,490
Speaker 0: So, what else can we say about MAGFest other than stuff that we said in the previous show about MAGFest?

1073
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:20,888
Speaker 0: You should go to it.

1074
00:47:21,493 --> 00:47:22,429
Speaker 0: It's really fun?

1075
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:27,390
Speaker 1: We still didn't go to the concerts just because you were gaming like crazy.

1076
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,710
Speaker 0: But Nobu was there with Earthbound Poppas.

1077
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,390
Speaker 1: And you can see it all on YouTube and he was awesome.

1078
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,209
Speaker 0: The whole thing's on YouTube.

1079
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:33,789
Speaker 0: He did the Colossus Roar.

1080
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:34,430
Speaker 1: Awesome.

1081
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:34,959
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1082
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:44,129
Speaker 1: Some other band, I think it was Bit Something, I forget their name, they had a guy play Mega Man 2 all the way through and they played the music during the whole thing.

1083
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:50,289
Speaker 0: There was, and I do want to bring this up because you could not avoid it, a lot of My Little Pony at this con.

1084
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:54,450
Speaker 1: There was indeed much pony even though BronyCon in New York was at the same weekend.

1085
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,088
Speaker 1: There was Mad Pony at MAGFest.

1086
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:04,570
Speaker 0: Like mad social currency and a girl dressed up in My Little Pony stuff totally groped my ass walking out of convention center after we talked about ponies.

1087
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,429
Speaker 0: I think she was drunk.

1088
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,410
Speaker 1: I had to tell on Rim.

1089
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,990
Speaker 1: I had to tell Emily on him because he was groping all the ponied ladies.

1090
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:10,765
Speaker 1: I was like,

1091
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:10,890
Speaker 1: "Rim.".

1092
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,270
Speaker 0: There was so much pony.

1093
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,509
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to be groping ponies.

1094
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,630
Speaker 0: The thing is, though, one girl, she made these cute rainbow- What's the word for somebody who gets it on with ponies?

1095
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:19,907
Speaker 1: Equestrophilia?

1096
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:20,730
Speaker 0: Equestrophile?

1097
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:21,250
Speaker 0: Pona-phile?

1098
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:21,644
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1099
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:26,390
Speaker 0: But of all the stuff, there was this one hat that was kind of cute.

1100
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:31,450
Speaker 0: It was like a Rainbow Dash hat, but actually when you wear it, it looks like you have Rainbow Dash's scalp.

1101
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,370
Speaker 0: Like you've scalped her and put it on your head.

1102
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,570
Speaker 0: It was kind of actually creepy seeing people wearing the hat.

1103
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:36,998
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1104
00:48:37,695 --> 00:48:38,028
Speaker 1: Not a fan.

1105
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,590
Speaker 0: Oh, the guy who does that canvas pixel art was there.

1106
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,450
Speaker 0: I like that guy.

1107
00:48:42,831 --> 00:48:44,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got to get him to make me something to go over my TV.

1108
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I grabbed a lot of business cards.

1109
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,570
Speaker 0: They're really cool people.

1110
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,950
Speaker 0: The culture of the con is great.

1111
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:49,386
Speaker 0: You know what?

1112
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,990
Speaker 0: Magfest in this venue had one thing going for it.

1113
00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:00,750
Speaker 0: The majority of the con was in one gigantic room, so you know how you do the wave in a stadium and it keeps going for a while?

1114
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,869
Speaker 0: The Colossus Roar would start, and when people were feeling it, you know, like 3 a.m.

1115
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:08,110
Speaker 1: on Saturday- Yeah, it definitely increased at night.

1116
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,249
Speaker 1: There'd be a lot more roaring.

1117
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:12,890
Speaker 0: But it would keep going for like five minutes, like looping around the room.

1118
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,918
Speaker 0: Saturday, one time, it just wouldn't stop because I remember it just kept going and it started to die out.

1119
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,210
Speaker 0: and then over by the machine, we hear it start up again.

1120
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,188
Speaker 0: It just didn't stop.

1121
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,510
Speaker 0: And then Wyatt looks at me.

1122
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:26,387
Speaker 0: He's like, "Oh my God, I want to punch every motherfucker in the motherfucking

1123
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:26,689
Speaker 0: face.".

1124
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,489
Speaker 1: You know if you said that to me, you know what I would've said?

1125
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:29,990
Speaker 0: You know what I said to Wyatt?

1126
00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:31,050
Speaker 0: What?

1127
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:35,270
Speaker 0: I love that aspect of Magfest so much.

1128
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:35,678
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1129
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:36,610
Speaker 1: It's weird.

1130
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,910
Speaker 1: It's like normally, right?

1131
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,508
Speaker 1: That would be like, "Wait, scratch

1132
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:39,589
Speaker 1: it.".

1133
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,370
Speaker 1: But, scratch it.

1134
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,148
Speaker 0: You know why?

1135
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,250
Speaker 0: Because there's an unspoken rule.

1136
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:49,489
Speaker 0: If you hear the Colossus roar, you respond in kind only if you are feeling it.

1137
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:50,835
Speaker 0: So 6

1138
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:51,198
Speaker 0: a.m.,

1139
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,630
Speaker 0: I'm not feeling it anymore.

1140
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:53,049
Speaker 0: You know what?

1141
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:53,888
Speaker 0: No one else is too.

1142
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,240
Speaker 1: So when one guy doesn't- But people are feeling it at 10 p.m.

1143
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:58,009
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

1144
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,130
Speaker 0: Magfest is awesome.

1145
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,730
Speaker 0: If you're a gamer of any stripe, you should go to Magfest.

1146
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,190
Speaker 1: Or like listen to video game music.

1147
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:08,090
Speaker 0: If you like our kind of shit at Magfest, tell them you liked it.

1148
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:11,690
Speaker 0: If you went to our panel and you liked it, tell them so we will do more stuff at Magfest.

1149
00:50:12,132 --> 00:50:15,589
Speaker 0: Also, if you liked Super Art Fight at Magfest, tell them.

1150
00:50:16,231 --> 00:50:17,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to the Super Art Fight.

1151
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:18,209
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

1152
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:18,849
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

1153
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:24,141
Speaker 1: I got photos of Magfest and also of the Super Art Fight in my Flickr because I have a camera now.

1154
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,069
Speaker 0: Yes, we will have a whole bunch of content from Magfest up on the inner tubes in short orders.

1155
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,530
Speaker 1: I have photos of things.

1156
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,068
Speaker 1: Oh snap.

1157
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:36,070
Speaker 0: And of course, kind of end this, if you want to see us at other cons, just tell the cons.

1158
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,410
Speaker 0: Don't tell us because I don't care anymore.

1159
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,150
Speaker 0: But if you tell a con and they come to us, that has a lot more weight.

1160
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:44,788
Speaker 0: Magfest came to us.

1161
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,389
Speaker 0: We were like, alright dogs, we're down.

1162
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,006
Speaker 0: And you know what?

1163
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:51,810
Speaker 0: Magfest is added to the list of cons I would go to even if I were not a guest.

1164
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:55,289
Speaker 0: I would show up and pay just to play games.

1165
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:04,140
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1166
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,259
